- Do you know why I'm here?<eos> To say this.<eos> You've been a thin layer of insouciance over an open pit of self-pity your entire life.<eos> This is not a joke.<eos> You do not have the luxury to mess around now that this is out of the bottle.<eos> You will study this.<eos> You will master this. Do you understand?<eos> Ain't you a bucket of empathy, blind man.<eos> - Please say yes.<eos> I cannot see you nod.
Look, I'm telling you it wasn't my dad. It was The Beast.<eos> I never even touched him!<eos> I used battle magic, the same magic that I'm gonna use to get out of here.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Come on.<eos> What did you do to my powers?<eos> I need my powers.<eos> The Beast is here, okay?<eos> He's coming for me.<eos> He's coming for you.
Are you ready?<eos> Come on.<eos> What did you do to my powers?<eos> I need my powers.<eos> The Beast is here, okay?<eos> He's coming for me.<eos> He's coming for you.<eos> He is coming to kill us.<eos> You have got to give me back my power!<eos> I've got to save you!
Very nice to meet you.<eos> Justice Röling.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> So it was quite a long trip, isn't it?<eos> Quite.<eos> What's the commotion?<eos> Oh, that's Sir William Webb from Australia.<eos> He's our tribunal president.<eos> No more bloodshed to cover, these reporters try to stir up trouble in other ways.<eos> Why did General MacArthur choose you as the president of the tribunal?
[Webb] All right.<eos> For today, all those in favor of Justice Röling's motion...<eos> Carried.<eos> [MacArthur] The Allied forces have decided to add a judge from India and one from the Philippines.<eos> Washington was opposed to representation from India from the beginning.<eos> The State Department has changed its mind.<eos> They seem to think it prudent that we add a few more Asian judges to the mix.<eos> I can manage the increased number.<eos> Ah, good.<eos> Good. I have a few recommendations for you.

I have a few recommendations for you.<eos> And I'd also like to speak at the opening of the tribunal.<eos> I think it might help to move things along.<eos> But the trial and its affairs are the purview of the judges.<eos> As president of the tribunal, I cannot let you speak. Nor can I allow you to influence our deliberations.
Well... you are always welcome at the Liaison Mission.<eos> Who's playing, General?<eos> Uh, Eta Schneider.<eos> Quite famous in Germany before the war.<eos> She came all this way for a party?<eos> [laughs] Hardly.<eos> She's been stranded here since 1941.<eos> [speaking German] Frau Harich-Schneider.<eos> [in English] My name is Bert Röling.<eos> Should I know you?

Well...<eos> I would have to assess your ability.<eos> That would be a great honor.<eos> Call me.<eos> If my schedule is free, we'll set a date.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm going home.<eos> Why?<eos> In all good conscience, I cannot continue to be part of these proceedings.<eos> But your own president asked you to take on this duty.
You know she worked at the Palais des Papes.<eos> We found out when her employer called to say Isabelle hadn't come to work.<eos> He was worried.<eos> It was 6 years after she left.<eos> And that was when you, Georges, asked the police to investigate.<eos> - Who was her boss?<eos> - René Coutelé.<eos> My husband was worried, but I called the investigation off.<eos> She was an adult. She'd made her choice, against our will.<eos> And you had some good news.
- Pascal and Dmitri.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yes. We've got the blogger!<eos> - Are you Avignon Eye?<eos> - Thanks!<eos> - Come with us.<eos> - It'd be my pleasure.<eos> Well, he didn't murder Pascal.<eos> - Problem?<eos> - I know you!
I don't want to miss this job.<eos> A kid, a loving guy, a family.<eos> Is that so hard?<eos> You're crazy, in your family.<eos> Is Dmitri there?<eos> No.<eos> He's cancelled his meetings for the day.<eos> When did he take on Marion Larrieu?<eos> Sorry, I can't talk about that.<eos> I'll take you in for obstructing police inquiries.
She didn't want to see me.<eos> Your mother was pregnant at 17.<eos> I've got nothing.<eos> I don't know who my father is.<eos> I do.<eos> Tell me or I'll kill him.<eos> Pascal Ledoux.<eos> You mother said so.<eos> I didn't know!<eos> I'll kill you.
-Oh, great.<eos> Then you and I will be doing the milk bath.<eos> Why don't we all just do the hot springs?<eos> We can all just...<eos> God. Come on, grandpa.<eos> The milk bath is going to be good for us.<eos> Cleopatra took milk baths.<eos> -Do you want to do the hot springs?<eos> -Do you?<eos> Is there anything else I can do for you?
What does this line say?<eos> Under "cargo"?<eos> "Tractors," sir. "Spare parts."<eos> Tractors? This signature.<eos> It's your signature, sir.<eos> No, I never signed this document.<eos> Looks like your handwriting, Mr. Palmer.<eos> It is a forgery.<eos> Mr. Duncan, take me to my car.<eos> Sir, I can't let you go anywhere, not in your current condition.
This place is picked over!<eos> Nothing left worth having.<eos> Anything worth having was never on display here to begin with.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Looks like someone already tried to crack it.<eos> Had no luck though.<eos> Unfortunately, it appears the combination died along with McTamney.<eos> Oh, there are other ways.<eos> Again with the dynamite, Mr. Fet?<eos> Do I look like a safecracker to you?
I never lived up to his high expectations, and he never missed an opportunity to let me know it.<eos> One day on the phone, we had a blowout, and... I hung up.<eos> And that was... six years ago.<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> I finally broke the silence.<eos> Went back to see him a couple of weeks ago, and I told him to get the hell out of the city.<eos> You'd think he'd take some stock in what I had to say but he didn't.<eos> Generally, I've found that more intelligent people are usually among the last to accept the existence of strigoi, and therefore the last to flee.<eos> But at least, he spared you the horror of having to release him.
I am no such thing!<eos> I am not like you: his emissary, his employee.<eos> I am Eldritch Palmer.<eos> I answer to no one.<eos> Certainly not to you.<eos> Believe what you will.<eos> The shipment has arrived, and as such, your responsibility in that matter is complete.<eos> The Master has no intention of following through on his promise of eternal life, yet here I sit, still alive.<eos> Why is that, Eichhorst?<eos> I ask myself that very same question every time I see you, Eldritch.

We share the same goal.<eos> Help me to help you!<eos> Give me the white.<eos> This is a single dose.<eos> You want the formula?<eos> We still have a long way to go.<eos> Agreed.<eos> One drop in each eye.<eos> But not here.<eos> I warn you.
What's going on there?<eos> Just keeping an eye on some property I own out there.<eos> Not smart.<eos> You're too important to this fight.<eos> Not to mention the fact that you're technically still a federal fugitive... or would be if you weren't - under my protection.<eos> - Well, technically, if I were in jail, you wouldn't have any bioweapon.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Eph, you're an epidemiologist from the CDC.<eos> You can train others to do this grunt work.<eos> I need you on my staff trying to figure this thing out on a larger scale.
! - Just right there.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Please fill this out.<eos> - Come on, we're almost there.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> Welcome to the Freedom Center.<eos> - Is this a medical emergency?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> Oh, yes, I see.<eos> Let's get you checked in to be treated.
What was in the shipping container on the Aurora Cutlass?<eos> I have no idea! Argh!<eos> Well, guess this guy is, uh, completely worthless to us, isn't he?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> No, wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!<eos> All I know, it was a large wooden crate.<eos> My job was to get it to a guy named Sanjay Desai.<eos> He's the one you should ask.<eos> - He's not the one we've got.<eos> - I can take you to where I left it!
We do not trust the pawnbroker.<eos> Then I wish you a speedy death.<eos> Wait!<eos> - What is your proposal?<eos> - I'm afraid it requires you to get down off those pedestals for something other than a captive human meal.<eos> We are ready to listen.<eos> I'll return this evening with instructions.<eos> Lucky for you, my current associates are amenable to dealing with undesirable partners.<eos> Knock, knock!<eos> Some soup for you.
- Hmm! - And, uh, looking through Fet's personal items...<eos> which I recommend no one do...<eos> I found a thermometer.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I washed it.<eos> I don't have a fever.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine. - How are you?<eos> - I'm OK.<eos> I have a violent headache but, obviously, it hit you harder.
Would you like to discuss the state of technology when you were at college?<eos> Using UNIX, were you?<eos> Stone tablets, nerd.<eos> Well,<eos> I am sorry for the hold-up.<eos> Back on it.<eos> Hey.<eos> If you go down, I don't have any chance of getting Zack back.<eos> So the first order of business is getting some nutritious food in you and a good night's sleep.<eos> And I can't do any of this without you.

I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - No, seriously, I worked with a lot of nurses.<eos> It's a busman's holiday for me. Trust me.<eos> OK, right.<eos> So, say there was this really beautiful young nurse; topless or lingerie?<eos> - Topless.<eos> - OK, topless with these... divine, big, beautiful breasts, and she came to look after me.<eos> And we just start kissing.<eos> Like, tongues everywhere kissing.<eos> That wouldn't do anything for you?
Our legion is spread out in the grid you suggested.<eos> We are on the highest alert.<eos> You believe the Ancients are located nearby?<eos> I do.<eos> The sun-hunters are clever and elusive, but we've seen them surface near there before, only to lose them each time.<eos> The Ancients need sustenance, yet cannot forage for themselves.<eos> - No!<eos> We will find them tonight.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Didn't Minow lead you to the cargo?
On East Tremont Avenue in the Bronx.<eos> That ring a bell?<eos> You knew its purpose.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - A slaughterhouse for harvesting human beings.<eos> How many of these blood farms are there?<eos> In North America?<eos> Under construction?<eos> Perhaps 100.<eos> I ought to cut you down where you stand.
There's no need to take your next turn. You've already lost.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> We can play out the next six moves, or you can just knock over your king right now.<eos> Maintain some dignity.<eos> Yeah, it's not gonna happen.<eos> Fine, it was bullshit.<eos> But this game is so boring!<eos> Yeah, well, I think it's over, anyway.<eos> Behind you.<eos> Yeah, you've got some of your own.
There's enough for both of you, man.<eos> Later, my bitches. Hah!<eos> I'm reading a chapter on strigoi hunters.<eos> A long line of them, dating all the way back to the ancient Sumerians.<eos> A Phoenician hunter set fire to a ship full of people merely on the suspicion that there was a strigoi on board.<eos> How is any of this useful?<eos> There's a commonality among all these hunters:<eos> the desire to act alone.<eos> They appear monomaniacal and often seem to be gripped by madness.<eos> Good thing none of this applies to you.

Is he a German? - Yes.<eos> - And was he loyal to the Fatherland during the war?<eos> Yes, he was.<eos> I heard a rumor he was employed at one of the concentration camps in Poland.<eos> Doing good work there, in my opinion.<eos> I wouldn't know about that.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, it would please me to meet him.<eos> And, upon completing a deal, deliver the Lumen into his hand.<eos> I will warn you, there have been others who have attempted to sell him forgeries.
The ship left port in Egypt 31 days ago.<eos> That's excellent.<eos> Now we need you to make sure that it ports here in New York.<eos> Given the chaos of the moment, it is a challenge for any vessel<eos> - to be permitted in the harbour.<eos> - Make sure that it docks?<eos> - Pardon me?<eos> - I'm sure Eldritch - will accomplish this.<eos> - What's on that ship - that's so important?<eos> - If you need to know, then I will tell you.
If it's all the same to you, I wish to get our business completed as soon as possible.<eos> Why?<eos> Surely you don't believe all of the superstitious notions that people have about the book?<eos> I'll just say it has been a peculiar burden to possess it.<eos> Well, you'll be glad to know that I'm about to unburden you, then.<eos> And you, you have no concerns at all, Mr. Kruger?<eos> About curses, calamities?<eos> I am a man who embraces the accursed, Mr. Pirk.<eos> Now, if you will excuse me for a moment.<eos> For you.
Bring it closer, please.<eos> Closer.<eos> Go on.<eos> Take it.<eos> Feel the weight of the silver in your hands.<eos> I do not need to.<eos> I can tell that it is a fake.<eos> And you are not who you say you are, Jew!<eos> _<eos> I recognized you right away.
I don't believe you.<eos> That sunlight will be on you in minutes, Doctor.<eos> A man can only be threatened by that of which he is afraid, and I am not afraid of death.<eos> At a certain point, repetition diminishes pleasure.<eos> This room is too shallow.<eos> Now, there must be another room here.<eos> Sudden immolation, a fitting end for a visionary, no?<eos> If it is my time to go, then so be it.<eos> Who were those men in there?<eos> They were clients of my associate, Saskia, the woman who sent you here.

Disrespectful men who harmed them.<eos> No one will miss them.<eos> No one will miss you either.

What is that for?<eos> You-you don't know what you're doing!<eos> True,<eos> I am not an anatomy expert like you.<eos> However, I do know you have an amazing ability to heal.<eos> But... if you were to lose one of your limbs...<eos> Oh no!<eos> No, no, no! Careful there!<eos> It would never grow back.<eos> I'm damning you to hell, Dr. Dreverhaven.
We now know how to defeat the Master, but we don't know where he is.<eos> Or even who he is.<eos> There is one person who could find out.<eos> Have you reconsidered my offer?<eos> I will never give you the formula for the white, but I will give you a dose.<eos> How long will a dose last?<eos> Long enough.<eos> In exchange, you will find out whose body the Master has taken.<eos> He is no longer in Bolivar's body?<eos> So he has lost faith in you.
We go at first light.<eos> Great. Let's go.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> - Captain.<eos> So, the big nest.<eos> - You have a plan.<eos> - Star-spangled time.<eos> Rockets' red glare, bombs bursting in air.<eos> Boom.<eos> We're setting you up with an insertion team to help you get to your target.
The King Muncher!<eos> We found him!<eos> - I don't know what we found.<eos> - Ah, come on.<eos> I lost six good men on those teams, and I got nothing to show for it.<eos> They're cutting bait. We're heading out.<eos> To do what?<eos> Try and control the outbreak in D.C.<eos> The capitol falls; the entire country does.<eos> I can get you out if you wanna come with us.
And your son?<eos> - Did the mother turn him as well?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But Nora saw Kelly taking him away.<eos> Without turning him?<eos> Doesn't make any sense.<eos> - Why would she do that?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Be careful, Ephraim.<eos> If she did not turn your son, it can only mean the Master plans to use the boy against you.
- Let's do this.<eos> - Go.<eos> You need to cancel this meeting, sir.<eos> You're in no condition.<eos> Don't give me orders, dear.<eos> Ever.<eos> Have I come at a bad time?<eos> Not at all, Herr Eichhorst.<eos> Please come in.<eos> Well, she's certainly a change of pace for you.
Don't give me orders, dear.<eos> Ever.<eos> Have I come at a bad time?<eos> Not at all, Herr Eichhorst.<eos> Please come in.<eos> Well, she's certainly a change of pace for you.<eos> I miss Coco.<eos> I'm sure you do, too.<eos> What's done is done.<eos> What can I do for you?
Your job is to provide me with the evidence!<eos> There is none!<eos> Strigoi blood is flat-out toxic to human beings. Period.<eos> This woman, this patient, came to your Freedom Center for help.<eos> Yes, we told her the treatment was experimental, but we didn't tell her it might end with a bullet in the brain.<eos> I won't do this anymore, Mr. Palmer.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> The professor tells me you lost your son and that your companion was killed.<eos> Yet you waited all this time to come here and share the tragic news.<eos> What prompted you to come now?
I was just trying to figure you out.<eos> You're... half human who feeds on people, but you've thrown your lot in with a strigoi hunter.<eos> I mean, don't tell me you believe in that magic book.<eos> You ridicule the Lumen, yet you take a keen interest in it.<eos> I like good fiction.<eos> I've lived a long time, Doctor.<eos> I saw Emperor Domitian slain by his own court.<eos> I witnessed Giuliano Medici's murder during Easter services and watched the Borgias strangle their own.<eos> Over the centuries, I've developed a keen nose for treachery, so<eos> I must wonder, what's the real reason you're here?
Even if the Master is keeping him alive just to get to me, I could still get him back.<eos> I suppose there's a small chance.<eos> I know that's not what you want to hear, but...<eos> Any chance is better than no chance.<eos> And if I can get that opportunity...<eos> Then you should take it.<eos> But you must beware. The Master knows your desire.<eos> You could be playing right into his hands. Of course.<eos> I'm very fond of Zack.<eos> Should an opportunity to rescue him arise, I'll do what I can to assist you.
There is only one explanation for your extraordinary vigour.<eos> Strigoi blood.<eos> You've found a way to refine it, haven't you, so you can remain human yet benefit from its restorative effects.<eos> That's insane.<eos> And what if I have?<eos> Give me the formula;<eos> I will walk away forever leaving the Master exposed.<eos> You can save this city and the human race.<eos> Your life's quest will come to a successful end.<eos> It costs you nothing.
And what if I have?<eos> Give me the formula;<eos> I will walk away forever leaving the Master exposed.<eos> You can save this city and the human race.<eos> Your life's quest will come to a successful end.<eos> It costs you nothing.<eos> You have everything to gain.<eos> Do we have a deal?<eos> I remember another handshake years ago in Vienna and the betrayal that followed.<eos> Yes, I betrayed you.
I should start charging my hourly rate.<eos> Hey, Doc?<eos> Join us for a drink?<eos> Stupid question.<eos> How's the patient?<eos> He's gonna make it.<eos> Not that he's happy about that.<eos> Well, neither am I.<eos> So how'd you end up on the pier?<eos> How did... How did Quinlan talk you into it?
How did... How did Quinlan talk you into it?<eos> Kelly offered me a deal.<eos> The Lumen for Zack.<eos> I helped Quinlan steal the book.<eos> The plan was to kill the Master and get my son back.<eos> It half worked.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> - You stole the book?<eos> And teamed up with that filthy half muncher against us?<eos> - It wasn't about you. - No?
I went out there to try to save my son.<eos> I failed.<eos> You won.<eos> - There's your thank-you.<eos> - You should have come to me.<eos> They were keeping Zack alive to trade him for the Lumen.<eos> - Now there's no need for that.<eos> - I'm sorry about your boy, Ephraim.<eos> Now, please leave.<eos> I don't want to see you right now.
The past doesn't mean shit now.<eos> - Alright, get back to work.<eos> - You got it, man.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Chain gangs?<eos> At best, I look like an inept asshole.<eos> At worst, a lying sack of shit.<eos> That interview was humiliating, Frank.<eos> Not to mention, a 16-year-old boy?<eos> We are doing what's necessary, for this city and for you.
And then when I eventually do, I just end up dreaming about Eichhorst's dungeon, that chain around my neck.<eos> I usually wake up around 3:00, choking.<eos> And I can't get back to sleep until the sun's up.<eos> - Have at it.<eos> - What are these?<eos> The green ones are for when you wanna stay awake and the tan oval ones are for when you want to go to sleep.<eos> - Do you still dream?<eos> - Unfortunately.<eos> - One in here for heartache?<eos> - I didn't want to ask you.
It's the law.<eos> Ah...<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey! That is it.<eos> You guys, that is it.<eos> Get off!<eos> Hey, off! Go.<eos> I am taking you home. Where are your keys and where is your car?<eos> - At home.<eos> - OK, fine. I'm gonna put you in a cab.

_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> After La Catedral, the next stop was Carlos Holguín... the old police training academy that had been repurposed as ground zero in the search for Escobar.<eos> The new honcho was Colonel Pinzón, the guy who was famous for his love of Uncle Sam.<eos> As a courtesy to your government, I'm allowing you to participate in this manhunt.
Just overtake him, you idiot.<eos> Clark Bronwen?<eos> Who's asking?<eos> You're that chick who was hanging around Tail Lights.<eos> I'm a reporter for CCPN.<eos> I want you to stop holding the races.<eos> Sweetheart, unless you could find me another way to make five grand a night, it ain't gonna happen.<eos> Here's a preview of the exposé that I am writing.<eos> You are the star of the piece.<eos> I had a little chat with some of your previous associates and dug up some revealing details about you.
I spent every waking hour tinkering and perfecting her solar-powered oven.<eos> Anyway, ten-year-old determination, you remind me of her.<eos> Did you scold her as well?<eos> Look, I know that this has been hard for you, but you're not in it alone.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Hell yes, I am.<eos> I... as much as you all want me to be part of your team, that's never going to happen.<eos> I'm always going to be a father first.<eos> And one day, Zoom is gonna make me choose between you and my daughter, and every time, unblinkingly, unflinchingly, I would choose my daughter.<eos> I will betray you.
Yes, I am.<eos> Hell yes, I am.<eos> I... as much as you all want me to be part of your team, that's never going to happen.<eos> I'm always going to be a father first.<eos> And one day, Zoom is gonna make me choose between you and my daughter, and every time, unblinkingly, unflinchingly, I would choose my daughter.<eos> I will betray you.<eos> That's binary thinking.<eos> It doesn't have to be either-or.<eos> Life is either-or... yes/no, black/white, love/hate... from the dawn of time to this moment right now.<eos> I guess I just have more faith in you than you have in yourself, and by the way, I came up with an idea or... a notion rather, on how we could close the breaches for good.
You're the bait.<eos> What?<eos> This is for two years ago, Clay.<eos> Stay.<eos> You know, it's ironic.<eos> I was just saying how much you remind me of the old Wells, and now, here we are, just like I did with him, standing on either side of this glass with me asking you, "Why?"<eos> I'm doing what I have to do to save my daughter.<eos> Yeah, at any cost, right?<eos> The cost of Joe's daughter.<eos> I told you, "I would betray you."
We have to help Wells.<eos> Look, guys, I... I was the one that trusted him first. I own that.<eos> I let him stay when literally all of you told me not to, so everything that's happened up until this point, it's on me, but this has to be a group decision.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well... I guess this is good-bye.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I told you, we're a team.<eos> Now you're a part of it.<eos> We're gonna help you save Jesse.<eos> We're not sending you through alone.
I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean to freak you two out.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> You didn't freak me out.<eos> - So, why'd Jerry give you a key?<eos> - To do the appraisal.<eos> - Appraisal of what?<eos> - Of the building.<eos> - Of this building?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Jerry asked you to do an appraisal of this building?
I'll take one of those.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No, that's fine.<eos> The more, the merrier.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I look forward to meeting you, too.
Hey, um... you don't know where the restrooms are around here, do you?<eos> I keep losing my way.<eos> It's so silly.<eos> No hiding.<eos> You need to be downstairs.<eos> Move.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> I almost believe you.<eos> You're an excellent liar.<eos> I need to fix you up, all right? So we're gonna go to my room.
Am I invited to the party?<eos> Um, it's been a long night. I needed something to eat.<eos> Well, there's plenty to celebrate.<eos> Maybe you don't get it because democracy is old news in the west.<eos> Jesus Christ...<eos> We are in the middle of a moment.<eos> People who have never known freedom are rising up, but this moment is as fragile as butterfly wings.<eos> The West come in with too heavy a hand and we fall apart.<eos> The tyrants get away with their brutality and it will take us another 20 years and another generation for another moment to arise.<eos> I mean, no wonder Lazar tried to kill you.
He hit me in the stomach with a lead pipe.<eos> So after that, I couldn't have children.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know, you really are a lot more gentle than you let on.<eos> I think you've been hurt enough.<eos> Shit...<eos> Open up.<eos> Check that door.<eos> They're gonna be here in a second.<eos> I need to hide you, okay?
Coming.<eos> Just a second.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Open up, this is your last chance.<eos> Oh, hi, guys. I'm sorry. I was in the john.<eos> How can I help?<eos> You really should be downstairs.<eos> We don't want civilians running around, getting into trouble.<eos> Yeah, uh, sorry.<eos> I recognize you.
- Are you gonna make it?<eos> - Yes, I'll make it.<eos> - All right.<eos> - What about you? Uh...<eos> I'll hold them off. - James.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> Go on, it's all right, go. Go!<eos> It's okay, come on.<eos> General.<eos> Vorza, we've been looking for you everywhere. - General.
Oh, sister, you said the story would get better and damn it, it did.<eos> So I started seeing him when Robert was away.<eos> And sometimes when he wasn't away.<eos> All those years, I thought you were stuck-up and boring as shit.<eos> But it turns out you were stuck-up and interesting as shit.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I don't know how to play chess.<eos> - This is not my lube!<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Mr. Brajaja-hadad, I'm going to call you right back.
Yeah. And we could not be more thrilled.<eos> I've got to say, I'm excited to be involved with such an eco-friendly company.<eos> Well, we really pride ourselves on that.<eos> You should.<eos> You are one of the first companies to ban all those foods which contain genetically-modified ingredients.<eos> Oh, you've done your research.<eos> Thank you, Dan.<eos> That means so much coming from a fellow hermano del mundo.<eos> OK.<eos> I like you. Huh?
-Gerry, I'm so sorry.<eos> -No, no, we're gonna change it!<eos> We don't have to have blood on our hands.<eos> This is a $3,000 suit.<eos> Please take Dan across the street to get him a sweatshirt -and to get his suit cleaned. -Yeah.<eos> Uh, so wait, just like any sweatshirt, or...<eos> Do you remember that talk we had about being more of a self-starter?<eos> Today's the day, Stephen.<eos> I don't want a sweatshirt. Dan, let's go.<eos> Good to meet you, Dan!
No background checks.<eos> This gun killed Bob and Sue Grant's 14-year-old son.<eos> And this is the gun that killed Agent Edward Meechum.<eos> Not many Secret Service agents buried at Arlington.<eos> I'd say he earned his place.<eos> I took it for granted, how important he was to me, how much I leaned on him.<eos> It's clear to me now, now that he's gone.<eos> I don't wanna make the same mistake with you, Donald.<eos> - How do you mean?<eos> - I didn't realize how much I lean on you.
You need someone who's hungry for this.<eos> I'm not a great campaigner.<eos> - Vermont doesn't help you.<eos> - You have a deep sense of duty, like all the men and women here who served their country, and that's far more important to me than strategy.<eos> To be honest, I don't know if I want it, Frank.<eos> When I had to take over, the stress, the responsibility...<eos> Two weeks as president was about as much as I can handle.<eos> I'm disappointed, Donald.<eos> But I understand.<eos> And I won't pressure you.
When my children grow up...<eos> Charlie and Lily... I wanna be able to...<eos> to look them in the eye... and tell them that I fought for you.<eos> I fought for your future.<eos> And to me, that future is clear.<eos> Less government, less taxes, more freedom, protect that freedom!<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> Governor, can you comment on your relationship with the search engine Pollyhop?<eos> Is it true Pollyhop is providing you with voter data?
Thank you, thank you.<eos> Governor, can you comment on your relationship with the search engine Pollyhop?<eos> Is it true Pollyhop is providing you with voter data?<eos> - I want Grant here, right away.<eos> - Uh, he's in California I think.<eos> He's got two Gulf Streams.<eos> Have him pick one.<eos> Thank you so much, thank you.<eos> Thank you, take care.<eos> Is it true Pollyhop is providing you with voter data?
Me and Conway.<eos> Now, Conway has a powerful gun, a search engine.<eos> And it's powerful because with it, he can tell what you think, what you want, where you are and who you are.<eos> He can turn all those searches into votes, and that's enough bullets to kill my chances of winning.<eos> But I have an even bigger gun.<eos> It's called the NSA.<eos> It's one of the perks of being president.<eos> That is, if the courts allow my surveillance request.<eos> I imagine the men hanging on these walls wished they'd had a gun like that available to them.<eos> Your phone, the phone of the person sitting next to you, your neighbor's phone and everyone you know and the 300 million Americans you don't know.

We're getting a FISA ruling, counter-terrorism.<eos> I've never won a bid from the NSA--<eos> - LeAnn, let's go.<eos> - You'd win the bid.<eos> This is what you want, Aidan.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You came here to see if you can trust me.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?<eos> I don't care whether you trust me or not.<eos> But if we go down this road, you take the fall if anything goes wrong.
How we want to use it, it's our prerogative.<eos> If they put a value on the benefits of sharing all that data, the figure would break all campaign finance caps there are.<eos> How the fuck did this get out?<eos> Sir?<eos> That reporter's not in our press pool.<eos> - We didn't credential him ourselves.<eos> - So, who does he work for?<eos> We're still trying to track that down.<eos> Give me your phone.<eos> I'll connect you now, sir.
But what did you really hope to achieve?<eos> I think you've wasted your time.<eos> You should have called me when you had some actual leverage.<eos> But I must say, it is a treat to hear you so worked up.<eos> I do thank you for that.<eos> "Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln.<eos> Tall men make good presidents." You said that when we first met.<eos> Yes, I remember what I said.<eos> You were intimidated.<eos> I don't underestimate you, Governor.
I saw Edward Meechum die before my very eyes.<eos> - Good.<eos> You were lucky.<eos> - I'm lucky.<eos> Statistics don't mean anything to these people.<eos> They see this as a one-way road to confiscation.<eos> I lose my seat in a heartbeat if I take this stance.<eos> - Now, this is where I will play good cop.<eos> - Okay, so Birch goes,<eos> "We're asking you to look at the bigger picture here, Mr. President."
Anything I say now is worth shit.<eos> That's probably why they've left me alone.<eos> No, no.<eos> No. No more pills.<eos> - Promise me you'll be careful.<eos> - I promise.<eos> I would help if I could, I--<eos> You just focus on taking care of yourself.<eos> Come here.<eos> Is there anything I can do to make you reconsider?
Are we reading your emails?<eos> The answer is no.<eos> We're not tracking individuals.<eos> We're looking at metadata, large-scale browsing patterns, search trends, regional portraits.<eos> 'Cause Ben is right.<eos> A president should know his constituents.<eos> And the Internet is the best tool for that.<eos> Now, I've met thousands of people and shaken a lot of hands, but I can't meet everyone.<eos> So this is my way of listening to millions of you.<eos> Now, it's only fair if I get to know you better, you should get to know me better.

Previously on "Bates Motel"...<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife.
He wasn't as lucky as you.<eos> Where am I?<eos> You're outside a club called The Landing Strip.<eos> You and Julian came here earlier tonight.<eos> The two of you got into a fight with some of the bouncers.<eos> Did anything bad happen?<eos> I don't think anyone got hurt except the two of you, if that's what you mean.<eos> Look, I'm going to find an officer and have him take off those cuffs.<eos> There's no need for that.<eos> Then I'll take you back to Pineview, but we're going to talk, Norman.
By my math, I think we could swing a week down at the ocean.<eos> Doug Myer's brother-in-law, he's got a house down in Myrtle Beach.<eos> I mean, it's not on the beach, but it's, you know, about 10 minutes away, and it's half as much as being at the water.<eos> You all right?<eos> I'm just gonna give Pam a quick call.<eos> Oh, she's fine.<eos> I'll just be a minute.<eos> Hello, Megan.<eos> I thought that was you.<eos> I'm sorry... do I know you?
Just for the weekend, to see Mama.<eos> Come in.<eos> This is Kyle. He's helping me with the shut-ins today.<eos> Nice to meet you, I'm Sophie.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Please, no ma'am.<eos> And how is your mother?<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> Well, what is it?<eos> Can I talk to you alone?
With the boy?<eos> When you did that to him, what'd you see?<eos> Here. Let me help.<eos> - Don't touch me!<eos> Don't! - All right, all right.<eos> - What happened? - Mama?<eos> She fell.<eos> All right. Let me help you.<eos> Come on. Take it easy.<eos> All right, Mildred, I got you.
- I mean...<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> - Ramon. - What?<eos> Not a sightseeing tour.<eos> Speak for yourself.<eos> We want our grandkids to know we did cool stuff.<eos> - Dr. Wells.<eos> - Henry.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> We weren't expecting you. - Ahh!
This is Cisco.<eos> - I'm Cisco.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And you are just a nice, normal guy.<eos> Okay, um...<eos> Dr. Wells, will you and your visitors be needing the conference room?<eos> Not necessary, Henry.<eos> Our visit will be short.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Good to see you.
- I'm Cisco.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And you are just a nice, normal guy.<eos> Okay, um...<eos> Dr. Wells, will you and your visitors be needing the conference room?<eos> Not necessary, Henry.<eos> Our visit will be short.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> Good to see you, sir.
I have a plan.<eos> What just happened?<eos> Oh-ho-ho-ho, doppelganger.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, how did I get here? What... who are... who are you?<eos> How do you look like me?<eos> Allen, what are you doing?<eos> Harrison Wells.<eos> The Harrison Wells.<eos> Oh, my God, am I in S.T.A.R. Labs?<eos> Okay, I have no idea what is going on here, but I've always wanted to meet you.
- Yeah.<eos> Don't worry about him.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> Who'd you think I was talking about?<eos> I thought you were talking about me.<eos> - You?<eos> - Yeah, 'cause we found Barry's double, so where the hell am I?<eos> You know, I always thought in another life I was, like, I don't know, like a really wealthy, famous inventor, you know, sort of like the Earth-2 Elon Musk.<eos> Only with less RBF, obviously.<eos> Here's some advice for you.
Kill him.<eos> Come on.<eos> God, this is making me so hot.<eos> This ain't over, breacher!<eos> Barry!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Barry?<eos> Killer Frost and Deathstorm.<eos> - You know them?<eos> - More importantly, they know you now;
I'm a little out of practice.<eos> I didn't even ask who you are.<eos> - We're friends of Luke.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> A Bible thumper and his little sidekick?<eos> Luke would fucking hate a couple of guys like you.<eos> Don't get me wrong. I mean, I love the man, but he's not exactly spiritual.<eos> If you love him, why kill his wife?<eos> Well, now that is a... somewhat long, complicated story.<eos> Even if I were to tell you, I don't... think that you could comprehend it.
That's the first honest thing you've said since you came in here.<eos> - At least I'm honest with myself... what I am, what I'm not.<eos> You see what he can do?<eos> Your friend, the outcast? The power he has?<eos> It is the Lord's power. Oh!<eos> Then why'd the Lord give it to him?<eos> He doesn't even believe!<eos> - It is not my will to question God.<eos> - But you do.<eos> It must tear you up.
I can't do it anymore. I'm exhausted.<eos> I need a Sucrets. Hey, you guys?<eos> This is my real voice.<eos> I don't know anything about tennis and I actually enjoy gas station tuna fish sandwiches. -Uh...<eos> A regular Rich Little. God... [chuckles] That shrill, horrible voice was hilarious!<eos> [in fancy voice] Can you imagine?<eos> It's almost a disability.<eos> I bet I'd be eligible for a handicapped parking placard for my Jag.<eos> But, hey, what are you... what are you into?<eos> What... turns you on? -What's your jam?
In that case, the joke's on him. -See that whole outfit?<eos> -Yes.<eos> $11 from the Bruce Boxleitner collection at Kohl's.<eos> Plus, double joke's on him.<eos> I had a rolling brown-out in those slacks courtesy of Ron Popeil's July Fourth ceviche bar. Well...<eos> I think I better clean up some plates.<eos> Looks like Barbara's busy.<eos> [Maria] Yeah, I'm gonna go too.<eos> Mmm... that Diane voice really wiped me out.<eos> Can I walk you to your car? Oh.
Chad.<eos> I'm just gonna look at him and say,<eos> "Chad, I just can't see you anymore."<eos> God, I'm so on!<eos> I wish he was here right now.<eos> [sighs] Help me out, Brian.<eos> I would love to have a fun cocktail, but I am up to my ear-balls in psych meds.<eos> [both chuckle] Do you have a non-alcoholic option?<eos> Sans alcohol?<eos> Let's see what our mixologist, Garlopfft, can whip up for you.
Oh, dear Chad.<eos> You loved me and I couldn't love you back.<eos> I wasn't ready, and I am so sorry, and I feel so ashamed.<eos> -Sweetie.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> And now a couple of words from Chad's wife.<eos> [sobbing] What?<eos> Rick Rondo, CAA.<eos> I worked with Chad at CAA.<eos> -You know, before he died, he was so pumped about signing you.
[stutters] He wanted to sign me?<eos> He was an agent?<eos> Yeah.<eos> At CAA.<eos> Our team pulled your OKCupes profile.<eos> What did you think those action dates were about?<eos> -I mean, you had him hiking, spelunking, sailing.<eos> If that kiln explosion hadn't literally ripped him in half, signing you would have. -[chuckling awkwardly]<eos> -Yeah. Anyway, I'm picking up his sloppy seconds, and I want you to know something important.<eos> I love you.

He didn't even need those. They were for show.<eos> He was the original hipster fraud.<eos> Think about it.<eos> He put buckles on his shoes?<eos> That ludicrous hairstyle?<eos> And the experiments with the fuckin' kites and everything?<eos> Fuck you, Ben Franklin.<eos> Eat a dick.<eos> Here's how this is gonna go down.<eos> I'm gonna shadow loaf you for 10 days.
Please.<eos> You look bored already. No.<eos> I'm just anxious.<eos> You make me nervous.<eos> -Brown skin makes you nervous?<eos> -No. Young skin makes me nervous.<eos> Young skin covering bones and brains.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Do you hate me?<eos> I think you're fucked up... -but I don't hate you.
Okay?<eos> [speaking Spanish] [in Spanish] Too many people are dying on these factory floors.<eos> [in English] There's a barbecue or... [in Spanish] We must organize and form a union.<eos> [in English] Excuse me, shouldn't you... be in class, speaking English?<eos> Look at this, Miss Maria.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Okay.<eos> This is Spanish.<eos> The devil papers.<eos> This doesn't concern you.
-What do children want? -[Blueberry whines]<eos> ♪ Have you ever thought about touching' a child ♪<eos> ♪ But didn't know how to do it?<eos> ♪ Well, children are so teachable... ♪<eos> Oh!<eos> Look at you!<eos> Like a Mexican James Bond. Oh.<eos> -[Josue's mom clearing throat] -Hey, I hope you don't mind I brought my mom, my brother, my sisters and my tío Rolo.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Nice to meet you guys. Cool.
Those kids hate me, but it doesn't matter.<eos> I mean...<eos> -I still got you.<eos> -You had me.<eos> I have some bad news.<eos> My family's not cool about us.<eos> This whole May-December thing is a no-go zone, bro-zone.<eos> What?<eos> I'm crazy about you, Maria.<eos> -But I just can't see you anymore. -What, you--
-But I just can't see you anymore. -What, you--<eos> Maybe if I was 40 years older, this could work.<eos> How old do you think I am? Seventy-one.<eos> Oh.<eos> Face it... we weren't meant to be.<eos> We had our moment in the sun, we had our laughs...<eos> It was one hell of a ride.<eos> Maybe one day, you'll be able to understand.<eos> -Hopefully before you die.<eos> I'll never forget you, Maria Bamford.
It's Chapter Two in my book, Keepin' It Carol, Carol Simples.<eos> [gasps] Oh, that's fun that you didn't go with the obvious pun.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Keepin' It Simples.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I left it on the table.<eos> Shit!<eos> Fuck!<eos> What am I gonna do with all those fucking mugs?<eos> What, I got to pay you now? Do I have to pay you?
Why don't you prescribe me something?<eos> Because I wanna go shopping and get some shoes. -Oh.<eos> -Reeboks.<eos> Right?<eos> -Really?<eos> Okay.<eos> Achter, give me the news, 'cause I have a bad case of loving shoes.<eos> Well, we can do a brain scan, and we can talk about the results.<eos> -Okay. -In fact, I'm gonna get another doctor<eos> -to take a look at you, okay?
Look, Ray Liotta is a very fine actor, and we have taken up enough of his time.<eos> Stop saying my full name like you have to keep telling them who I am. Well...<eos> So, wait -- you live with Barbra Streisand?<eos> - Y-y-you got the map. ‭<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She lived here for about 2 months 15 years ago.<eos> You think the bastards would update these things to reflect the current movie-star owners.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come on, kids.<eos> We're very sorry to have bothered you.
Tell me you like it now that I've shaved it off!<eos> Black mother and white father, but I've never met him. - That's a story that should be out there more -- white fathers who abandon their families.<eos> What else?<eos> What else?<eos> So, this is Walter.<eos> Just as I took over for Jeremy when his shift ended, he'll be taking over for me.<eos> Unless you're ready?<eos> I think we're still talking. But thanks.<eos> Walter?<eos> Could I ask you a quick question right over there?
Oh, my goodness, you're so beautiful.<eos> -Well, thank you.<eos> -I'm back here.<eos> I'm Frankie.<eos> -Hi, there. -Oh.<eos> I'm Grace.<eos> This is Coyote's mother.<eos> Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> - So nice to meet you. Oh!
-Can we join you?<eos> -Oh, please.<eos> Here we go, girl.<eos> Come on.<eos> Sit.<eos> Good girl.<eos> What made you step out of the closet after all these years, Robert?<eos> I fell in love.<eos> Now, that's a great reason.<eos> Good for you.
Thanks again.<eos> Nwa-bu-di-ke.<eos> Now you got it.<eos> How did you come up with such interesting names like Nwabudike and Coyote?<eos> We have a pretty interesting family here, Krystle.<eos> It's not like we were gonna name our kids: Mike, Bob and Steve.<eos> Uh, Mom, um, Steve is one of Krystle's boys.<eos> And what a great name it is.<eos> I mean, I wish we'd thought of it, but we're way too weird.<eos> I'm sorry. I-I hope I didn't offend you.
Sol should go before he embarrasses himself any further.<eos> I am not embarrassed about any of this.<eos> I walk into places all the time like this.<eos> And I leave like this, too.<eos> Not embarrassed!<eos> I am so sorry about that.<eos> Oh, it's OK.<eos> I mean... you told him Augie's full name and totally neglected to mention mine, but--<eos> He's a crazy person.<eos> I didn't want to introduce you to a crazy person.
Big honking bummer.<eos> That's my roommate.<eos> Maybe you could explain to the officer why you abandoned me in a dangerous parking lot?<eos> I'd really rather not.<eos> Uh, no! I want to know what was so pressing, so much more important than my needing you to come--<eos> Would you pick up a person who was drunk and emotionally assaultive?<eos> Do it every day.<eos> But I guess, yes, if the person was a friend.<eos> Good answer.<eos> Your mother raised you well.
if she was so plastered she called you a failure in front of your sons, and told your new boyfriend that you were afraid of sex in the vagina, and she ate the cake you made for him with her hands?<eos> I ate cake?<eos> You also told me that you would be better off without me and then you broke the toilet.<eos> I'm not sure I understand the importance of the toilet.<eos> She flushed my geodes.<eos> Oh, in that case, I'd say you did the right thing. -Ha!<eos> -I would've also changed the locks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Here's my card.<eos> I'll call you if we find anything.
That's shit you need to know about my brother.<eos> So, John, Wayne knows enough now to get you locked up.<eos> - Turn it off.<eos> - We're all gonna get along, or I take you both down with me.<eos> Fucking turn it off.<eos> I'm a businessman, Detective.<eos> And I need my business back up and running, so this bullshit with the task force?<eos> You're gonna bring it to an end.<eos> And nothing happens to me or anyone who works for me.<eos> Now, I know there are gonna be a lot of people who would be very interested in hearing what your brother has to say about you.
I didn't say you were the right candidate, Detective.<eos> Forgive me for saying this, but a campaign manager just seems like overkill for a sheriff's race.<eos> Maybe you should hear what Burt has to say.<eos> A few campaign speeches and some lawn posters, and...<eos> I mean, this is Monroe County.<eos> We're not talking about a national election.<eos> Well, in addition to lawn signs, you've got polling, message refinement, debate prep, event planning, party relations, fundraising, FEC compliance.<eos> You kiss the babies for him as well?<eos> I provide the babies.<eos> I'm not gonna lie to you, Detective.
That was Largo.<eos> Some nut job lost his shit on a waitress up there and they want us to head up.<eos> What do they want us for?<eos> Someone specifically asked for me and you.<eos> This her?<eos> Hi, how are you?<eos> Detective Diaz, Detective Rayburn.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> The guy that was bothering you, do you know him?
It's great.<eos> It was a great idea.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> Good. You using the time to clear your head and get your focus back?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> That's what you said to do.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Because the Pell case is going to trial.<eos> I need you back and on your game.
I mean, you trusted me and you helped me.<eos> I know about the drugs, too.<eos> I never meant for anything bad to happen.<eos> And I don't want anything bad to happen to you.<eos> So, I talked to my brother John and he's willing to help you.<eos> You just have to go in there and tell him the truth.<eos> There are men that are trying to kill me.<eos> - Lowry's men.<eos> - I know.<eos> He can protect you.
- I know.<eos> He can protect you.<eos> Just talk to John.<eos> Can you do that, please?<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> - This better be fucking good.<eos> - We're sorry to bother you, Judge, but we have an affidavit for a search warrant that needs impartial eyes.<eos> Oh, well, that's cute, detective.<eos> I tell you what these impartial eyes are seeing.<eos> You two got shot down by the judge on duty and decided to come all the way out here and ruin my day off.
What is it you want from us?<eos> I don't want anything from you, Sally... so you can fucking relax.<eos> And you can clean up your fucking mouth.<eos> Now come inside for some lemonade.<eos> Hey.<eos> You Frosty?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> - Mutual friend.<eos> Malaki says he met you at a party.
- I don't wanna get anyone in trouble.<eos> - Who might you be getting into trouble?<eos> Miss Rayburn.<eos> What?<eos> - It was her idea.<eos> She bribed the witness. - No.<eos> You mean it was Danny's idea.<eos> No, it was your sister, Meg.<eos> She didn't think she'd get my charges dropped, so she got Rafi Quintana to pay the witness. Fuck you.<eos> My sister barely knew you.
She didn't think she'd get my charges dropped, so she got Rafi Quintana to pay the witness. Fuck you.<eos> My sister barely knew you.<eos> Why would she care about your charges?<eos> Because she wanted me to help you.<eos> Help the whole Rayburn family.<eos> Help the Rayburn family do what?<eos> Move cocaine through the inn.<eos> You listen to me, Carlos.<eos> You and I had an agreement.<eos> I would keep you from getting dragged into this and then one day, you would help me.
Help the whole Rayburn family.<eos> Help the Rayburn family do what?<eos> Move cocaine through the inn.<eos> You listen to me, Carlos.<eos> You and I had an agreement.<eos> I would keep you from getting dragged into this and then one day, you would help me.<eos> And today is that fucking day.<eos> I need your help.<eos> You only protected me because you were working for Lowry.<eos> Wayne Lowry is using you to fuck with me and my family.

Here we go.<eos> - Tess? - Yeah.<eos> That's a nice name.<eos> I'm Dr. Song.<eos> What did you want to talk to me about?<eos> I want you to examine me.<eos> For what?<eos> I want you to tell me if I've ever had a baby.<eos> A baby? - Yep.<eos> - Um, Tess, according to your computer records, you've already asked Dr. Obie and Dr. Rosenthal up at Mount Sinai to examine you.
- Sorry.<eos> - Right.<eos> My feeling, for what it's worth? The world revolves around meetings.<eos> Without meetings, we wouldn't get to know each other, exchange fresh ideas, have conversations.<eos> Don't you think it's important to have conversations?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I have a project. I need your assistance.<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> I don't like being held hostage.<eos> Who's holding you hostage?
- Right.<eos> My feeling, for what it's worth?

I need your assistance.<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> I don't like being held hostage.<eos> Who's holding you hostage?<eos> I'm asking to borrow you for five minutes for which I will pay you $50,000.
- Uh-oh. That's her hay fever.<eos> - Hey! - Here.<eos> - Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> - Here you go.<eos> Stop!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm sorry, but I have to ask you guys to come back in.<eos> We're already late.<eos> I know, but I can't let you go.
Hey, Jana, McKinley Research is sending over their CPU today, high priority.<eos> Can't wait, Dennis.<eos> Well, all right, then.<eos> Major Carnahan, thank you for meeting me.<eos> Oh, you can call me Lex.<eos> You seem important enough. Ha ha!<eos> Certainly act like it, don't I?<eos> Please.<eos> Lex, I asked for you because you strike me as someone who could be a benefit in this situation.<eos> People seem to like you, and situations like this are made or broken by the civilians' response to authority.
Sabine, but keeping people calm is my job, so I'm not so sure what you're asking here.<eos> There are gonna be a lot of opinions flying around.<eos> The CDC's credibility took a few hits during the Ebola crisis.<eos> Social media is gonna break this before we do, and once the media gets hold of it, well, we're gonna need a face, a man of the people, someone they inherently want to trust.<eos> This is in your zone.<eos> These people know you.<eos> This kid, if he wasn't Middle Eastern, would we be taking all these precautions?<eos> It is because he's Syrian that there is an elevated concern about bioterrorism, yes.<eos> Lex, I recognize that there's a lot going on here behind closed doors.<eos> If I can count on you, your access will grow in direct proportion to your level of cooperation.
Good.<eos> I'll see you tonight.<eos> A potential exposure.<eos> That's all they said.<eos> Britney had the sniffles, so they took her for more observation, but her mom's boyfriend... the bus driver, yeah... says she's got hay fever.<eos> Hey, stop that.<eos> Hey, you guys, no running, OK?<eos> Hey, I'm talking to Principal Watkins.<eos> Mary, no touching, either.<eos> I'll call you back.
Hey, 4 to 6 feet, miss.<eos> And my son Quentin, I didn't just let him run off.<eos> He was obsessed with the rats.<eos> I was talking to parents. Excuse me.<eos> We need to get in there.<eos> It's restricted.<eos> Uh, we're looking for a couple young kids.<eos> They'd have been heading for the research labs.<eos> Can we just take a quick look?<eos> I can't let you in there.
Yeah. I would.<eos> Ha ha! Anyway, they live in fear that something will go wrong on my watch, and I live in fear of them being right, so...<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> My son Quentin...<eos> They're officially putting the hospital on lockdown.<eos> We're already on lockdown.<eos> Well, they don't want anyone leaving for 48 hours.<eos> - 48 hours?<eos> - Got to be kidding me.<eos> Look. I'm not gonna lie to you.
That would be you, Major.<eos> It's all good, Grandpa.<eos> I got to go.<eos> I'm catching a train to North Springs to see Xander, our little secret, OK?<eos> I will.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> They'll back in. What's the deal?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, what's up with this?<eos> This station is now closed.<eos> I need you to exit the platform.
They're not gonna let me out.<eos> I had contact with patient zero.<eos> I mean, it's the freaking zombie apocalypse up there in Isolation Ward.<eos> - I'm not getting out.<eos> - Jake...<eos> Screw you, Lex, all right?<eos> You're the one who sent me in here.<eos> Jake. Ja...<eos> I really appreciate all of you coming.<eos> Ms. Lommers, I asked you what your intentions are for our city.
Ladies and gentlemen, I need your cooperation, please.<eos> - Step back away from the fences.<eos> - I have to get to my kids, man. Ladies and gentlemen, please back up.<eos> Back up now.<eos> Please stay away from the fence.<eos> Coming through.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Move back.<eos> I need you to back up, sir.<eos> I need you to back up, please.
Then we'll all be sent home.<eos> Yes, Bert.<eos> My wife Micheline is home alone.<eos> Who decides when we get to leave?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> I will have to get back to you on that.<eos> Showing us that even as the city is torn apart by this volatile situation, there is always room for a hero.<eos> Nice piece.<eos> Just a hack blogger looking for an angle.<eos> Still, it is why I hand-picked you to be the representative for the Atlanta P.D.
So, last night I'm a hero but today, I'm the enemy.<eos> No, last night I thought maybe you were one of the good guys.<eos> Good guys get a lot of clicks in these situations.<eos> Villains, too, but no, I've decided that you're not really good or bad.<eos> I think you're just theirs.<eos> And in my experience, where there's a mouthpiece, there's a secret.<eos> My guy at Homeland tells me that Syria has denied any awareness of Sayid nassir.<eos> Even ISIS won't take credit.<eos> It's kind of hard to call this bioterrorism without any terrorists, don't you think?<eos> Did anyone bring you into the loop on that?
I'm gonna go train.<eos> Knock-knock.<eos> Am I hallucinating, or is that disgraced ex-Mercury employee Caitlin Snow?<eos> Eliza Harmon, burning the midnight oil.<eos> Don't you ever take a break?<eos> Well, you know what they say, these thiocyanate ions won't bond themselves. - Hi.<eos> - Hi. Who is your handsome friend?<eos> - Detective Joe West, ma'am.<eos> - Detective?<eos> What brings you around these parts?
Hey, I was really hoping you wouldn't make me do one of those "I have to kill you each one by one until you give me what I want."<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> You want V-9?<eos> We'll make it for you.<eos> Dad, you can't.<eos> We have all the ingredients.<eos> I'm not a patient person, so better move fast.<eos> Ah, latte for me, and a Flash for you.
This season on "Legends of Tomorrow"...<eos> I've assembled you all because I need your help.
Unfortunately, Vandal Savage has already succeeded in murdering Miranda and Jonas.<eos> Savage still has Carter and Kendra.<eos> This is a timeship.<eos> A little gift from our friends.<eos> I no longer need to rule the world.<eos> I now have the ability to change it.<eos> What are we doing back here?<eos> Savage has a timeship, courtesy of the Time Masters.<eos> The timeline is unclear, due to our destruction of the Oculus, meaning Savage is lost to history.<eos> Which is why I brought you all home.
We'll find him again.<eos> And then what?<eos> We have no way of killing Savage, particularly now that Kendra and Carter are in his possession, assuming that they're still alive, - which is highly unlikely.<eos> - So that's it?<eos> - We're... we're just giving up?<eos> - I'm on my way to the refuge to retrieve our younger selves and return them to the timeline.<eos> It will be as if you never left.<eos> What, you think that we can just return to our old lives, and then pretend like none of this ever happened?<eos> Mm, that might be a tad difficult.<eos> So I had to bring you back to May 2016, not January 2016.
- When can I kill him? - We have to wait<eos> - for the meteor to go critical.<eos> - When's that?<eos> When he starts the ritual in all three time periods.<eos> Um, we got a nuclear bomb, here.<eos> Professor, Jax, we need you.<eos> Oh, man, I forgot how much of a badass I was.<eos> Look.<eos> What do you mean you don't have the money?<eos> I was going to sell a nuclear warhead and pay you out of the profit.
You're the best guy I ever knew.<eos> You may not think you're a hero, but you're a hero to me.<eos> You got that?<eos> Yeah, I got it.<eos> See you around.<eos> You okay?<eos> Fine.<eos> - So did you tell him?<eos> - That he killed himself to save our destinies?<eos> If it's any consolation, I can always bring you back to this particular time and place.
- How many?<eos> Rich or poor, we all deserve the same chances.<eos> Liberty, equality aren't just words beloved of poets and dreamers, they should be the core of every man's life.<eos> Why should a man born in a Paris backstreet not have the same chances as a man born into a palace?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> - Thank you. - You inspired me.<eos> - You know where to take these. - Yes.<eos> - Powerful words. - Oh.<eos> I hope we'll see you again, monsieur?
What do you guys think?<eos> Your plan is asinine.<eos> Did you find Jesse?<eos> Does it look like I found Jesse?<eos> How many times have you traveled through time? - A few.<eos> - Do you have any idea how many things you could screw up?<eos> All I need is one conversation with Dr. Wells.<eos> - He's not Wells. - Thawne.<eos> I'm Wells!<eos> This man has been studying you for 15 years... for 15 years... and you don't think he's gonna know who you are?
Well, the likely reason for that is you're getting faster.<eos> Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.<eos> It occurred to me that maybe we've been going about improving my speed the wrong way.<eos> How so?<eos> Well, I've been learning different techniques involved in running, and I was thinking that there's just as much science involved in speed as anything physical or technical.<eos> I just can't figure out how to apply it to me when I run.<eos> Thought if anybody could help me, it'd be you.<eos> This is quite the... speed equation you've concocted here, isn't it, Mr. Al?<eos> Yeah, I've been doing a lot of reading in my downtime.<eos> What on earth inspired you to adopt such a... what should we call this...
What?<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> We're here for the answer to your speed equation... the reason that you traveled back to this time, and the key to running faster.<eos> Tachyon enhancement.<eos> This was not the deal.<eos> If you think that I'm gonna hold your hand this entire way, you're sadly mistaken.<eos> Everything you need is on this drive.<eos> You follow its instructions, you will enhance the Speed Force in your system and run faster... than you ever thought possible.<eos> If this doesn't work... I'm coming back.<eos> Dr. Wells, we need you.
We closed all the breaches and have no idea how to reopen them.<eos> We don't...<eos> Wells?<eos> Yeah, I have an idea, Allen.<eos> Let's keep the breaches closed forever.<eos> Forget about the breaches.<eos> Forget about Zoom.<eos> Wait, I'm sorry,<eos> I thought that you were on board with this.<eos> No. No. I said I would help you get faster.
I just... have you had any luck locating my daughter?<eos> Not yet, but I circulated her picture through every department in the region.<eos> And I reached out to some friends in Keystone.<eos> She's smart.<eos> She's gonna know how to stay hidden. - She's...<eos> - We'll find her.<eos> Right.<eos> There's another thing also, Detective.<eos> A favor.<eos> I would ask you to talk Barry out of reopening the breaches to my Earth.
I know what we're gonna find here.<eos> Point is for you to see it.<eos> Hey, Roy!<eos> Roy!<eos> Reverend?<eos> How are you?<eos> What are you doing all the way out here?<eos> Uh, this is a friend of mine. Kyle Barnes.<eos> Hey, Kyle.<eos> Pleased to meet you.
Looks like you were right to hold back on the dogs.<eos> Good news?<eos> Just a case I'm working.<eos> So, whose problem is it?<eos> I'm gonna let you get back to it.<eos> Wouldn't want that blight to spread to your whole grove.<eos> I don't need any magazine subscriptions, or life insurance, or house numbers painted on my curb.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't realize.<eos> What do I call you?
These things, all these possessions, they yours?<eos> Some of 'em from before I arrived.<eos> Most of 'em since.<eos> You find your passions here.<eos> You, uh...<eos> Have you found things to engage you?<eos> I have a job.<eos> Of course.<eos> I suppose you're here about the Barnes boy.<eos> He came to see you.
Look, I don't know where that girl Sherry is right now, but God sure as shit didn't put her there. No.<eos> Who did then, you?<eos> The "Outcast," whatever the hell that is, with your magic touch?<eos> Wake up, Reverend.<eos> All these souls you think you're saving with God's infinite wisdom?<eos> It's bullshit.<eos> Look at her.<eos> And Brian. And Mildred.<eos> That man in there's praying for a miracle that you and I both know is never gonna come, 'cause no one's fucking listening.<eos> If your God is out there, he's laughing at you.
- Then go.<eos> Fear gives them strength, and if that's what you bring here,<eos> I don't need you!<eos> Who's there?<eos> Patricia McCready.<eos> From the Light of God Church.<eos> We've met before.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Well, what are you doin' sittin' in your car in the dark?<eos> I didn't wanna... bother you, I suppose.
You can take her on away now.<eos> This isn't exactly on your way home.<eos> I called 911.<eos> Look, am I in trouble?<eos> I was trying to do the right thing here.<eos> Well, there's a first time for everything, I guess.<eos> Can I go?<eos> Our friend, the Reverend, says that you have a particular knack for this thing that he does.<eos> She attacked me last night.<eos> She attacked you?
What I do is take an ambient sound and create a track.<eos> Then, I compose the music...<eos> Oh, I thought he was the musician.<eos> No, the guitar is just a hobby.<eos> I'm the graphic designer.<eos> Oh.<eos> Can I see?<eos> Fine.<eos> Just making sure there were no guns.<eos> I'll walk you in.
I've been nibbling.<eos> The air moves...<eos> I don't know if we've noticed...<eos> Sometimes we see actors, voice artists... politicians, even, struggling, seeking a voice.<eos> A voice to follow, a voice to imitate.<eos> But from imitation comes limitation, so the question is:<eos> Don't answer now.<eos> Tell me after the break when we return on "Our Very Own Art".<eos> How are you?<eos> I'll walk you to your room.
- Don't post anything you do here.<eos> - No, of course.<eos> Martín, Martín, Martín, Martín.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Today's password.<eos> Martín.<eos> Four times.<eos> No spaces, no periods. Nothing.<eos> Hey!<eos> I didn't see you.
Here are some towels.<eos> - Hi!<eos> - Hi.<eos> I heard your boyfriend is a great designer.<eos> I like his work.<eos> I see you got online.<eos> Yes.<eos> Enrique gave me today's password.<eos> Hey!<eos> I didn't see you.
In that case, she can come after the barbecue, when we're done.<eos> If she wants, we'll save her some food.<eos> Oh, I told her already.<eos> So...<eos> OK.<eos> - Here then, Laura?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, you're almost here.<eos> Come in, come in, we'll greet you here.
C'mon, just stay.<eos> You can use the computer if you want.<eos> And if I have to use the toilet?<eos> You get out, there's a hall to your right, and it's there.<eos> Or wait for me, I'll be here soon.<eos> - Go, go.<eos> - I'll tie you up.<eos> Go.<eos> If you prefer, we don't have to watch it now.<eos> That's not why we invited you.
Anyway, we already... we have a major advertising agency.<eos> They've worked for us for a long time.<eos> Posters, everything.<eos> - Did we bring anything to show them?<eos> We used a photo of you from your internet profile.<eos> But you should have asked me.<eos> You didn't tell him, Enrique?<eos> No.<eos> I wasn't too sure about it either.<eos> As we said, we have two slots for you:
Listen, Martín.<eos> In the end, you will be running things.<eos> But you need a mentor.<eos> A political mentor.<eos> At least that's what your father said, and I comply.<eos> - All good?<eos> - All good?<eos> All good.<eos> Ro?<eos> I understand you, Martín.
Have a seat.<eos> - Have a seat.<eos> - No, er...<eos> I kinda lost Mateo, and then I...<eos> I shouldn't be here.<eos> I'm an "infiltrator".<eos> I'd rather have my accountant look into it.<eos> Yes, Martín, the most important thing is that you have no doubts.<eos> Who do you work for?<eos> Who sends you?
You can play by the rules and still have fun.<eos> Here. Here's a few tokens on the house.<eos> Let's go!<eos> I brought a treat for you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, it's all right.<eos> It's all right, yeah.<eos> There. Open wide.<eos> Well, good mornin'!<eos> I'm placing you under arrest for assault.
You think you know what this is about.<eos> Reverend, I'm telling you, you're wrong.<eos> Fine.<eos> Why don't you talk me through it?<eos> I mean, what are we up against here?<eos> What is it inside of her, huh?<eos> Look, until we know, we gotta let it be.<eos> For now, okay?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll take you home.
I should've called first.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't know where else to go.<eos> You've been fightin'.<eos> For a while now... for the first time...<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm Aaron.<eos> Aaron McCready.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm the one who got you out.
The storm in Roanoke when I was--<eos> Pardon the interruption.<eos> But before you all make a grave mistake, I would like to be heard.<eos> I believe I've earned that right at least.<eos> This is a private church meeting.<eos> I am this church, Tansy.<eos> I built it from nothin'.<eos> Laid the foundations of my own blood, sweat, and tears, and you damn well know it.<eos> Now, at some point, every one of you has come to me for spiritual guidance, and I've always been there to provide it.<eos> Now, I implore you to place your trust in me now.

To isolate and embarrass me even further.<eos> It's been his plan all along.<eos> Well, if you knew that, then why'd you fall for it?<eos> It's not every day you get to punch the devil in the face.<eos> Why isn't he in handcuffs?<eos> Look, mister. Since there's no real harm done, I suggest we forgo all the usual legal formalities.<eos> Why would we do that?<eos> That man there, I've known for the better part of 20 years.<eos> But you... you, I don't know from Adam.<eos> Now, I warned you once about messing with my friends.
I heard a scream.<eos> Baby, you okay?<eos> Help.<eos> Help.<eos> No!<eos> I'm so damn tired of pushing a rock up a hill.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> My way isn't working.<eos> I accept that.<eos> But if anything, all I've done is hold you back.

- We need your help.<eos> Honey, what is it?<eos> Evening, Rose.<eos> Sorry to trouble you so late.<eos> I got it, Rosie.<eos> Got what?<eos> Apparently, we got a situation.<eos> Well, then I guess you better deal with it, but don't leave these children standing out in the cold.<eos> - Come on in, sweetheart.<eos> - There you go, honey.
Yeah, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that that's you.<eos> You want me to tell you who he is?<eos> I can't do that. No, I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I was actually hoping that you could set up a meeting for me.<eos> A meeting?<eos> Between you and him?<eos> I... I don't know if I can do that either, Wally.<eos> Well, why not? Joe?<eos> Singh wants to see you.
Then they could be from Earth-2.<eos> Probably.<eos> We got to get Jesse. Find Wells.<eos> Fast.<eos> Dr. Harrison Wells.<eos> Yup.<eos> And who are you?<eos> Name's Griffin Grey.<eos> Griffin Grey?<eos> Do I know you? Nope.
- How would we live?<eos> - I'd write novels.<eos> You'd be a star of the stage.<eos> - (LAUGHS) In India?<eos> - America then.<eos> I don't know about you, but I could do with a dry sherry right now.<eos> Must be the holiday traffic that's keeping her.<eos> Appears so.<eos> GEORGE: Mr Wiley.<eos> Good to see you.
Where are you injured?<eos> Let's get him off the street.<eos> (GRUNTS) ELIZABETH:<eos> - Get him into the cathedral.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Please state your business, Father.<eos> You're little more than a boy.<eos> I'm a volunteer for Ireland, Father.<eos> What's your business with us?<eos> I've been with Archbishop Walsh and His Grace told me to ask you to stop this madness before any more harm to people or property occurs.

(TYPEWRITER CLACKING)<eos> MATTHEW:<eos> Thank you, yes, I'm grateful to you for informing me.<eos> - Thank you, Mrs Magee.<eos> - PEGGY: You're welcome, sir.<eos> Surrender?<eos> I've taken the liberty of drawing up our resignation letters.<eos> CHARLES: Were we not just doing just as we were instructed?<eos> We were the ones who were doing, or not doing, none the less.<eos> I repeatedly attempted to warn you, Under Secretary, and Chief Secretary Birrell, to the dangers.
- You're going.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> - You're going home.<eos> - No.<eos> Get out!<eos> - The Mahons, ma'am. - (BABY COOING)<eos> Please.<eos> Would you like some more?<eos> You're a saint to feed people in your lovely house when food is so scarce.<eos> Was it my brother that sent you?
Papers, please.<eos> Can I help you, sir?<eos> Yes, what is all this?<eos> It's a temporary field hospital, sir.<eos> In the Castle? NURSE:<eos> Military trying to humiliate us.<eos> That's Connolly isn't it, the union leader?<eos> It's a gangrenous wound. But the doctor says if we operate we can save the foot. (CONNOLLY COUGHING)<eos> Why save the foot, when you have no intention of saving me?<eos> I'm sure we do intend saving you.
George Wilson.<eos> I expect you know who I am.<eos> I was writing a letter to my mother. GEORGE:<eos> I'm sorry if I interrupted.<eos> I was finished.<eos> GEORGE: Would you like a cigarette?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Why are you here, Mr Wilson?<eos> GEORGE: A courtesy, Mr Pearse.<eos> The senior prosecutor, Mr Wiley, has asked me to inform you of the charges you and your fellow leaders face.
Why are you here, Mr Wilson?<eos> GEORGE: A courtesy, Mr Pearse.<eos> The senior prosecutor, Mr Wiley, has asked me to inform you of the charges you and your fellow leaders face.<eos> The charge is of assisting His Majesty's enemies in a time of war.<eos> A capital offence.<eos> That's very kind of him, but please tell Mr Wiley that I'm in no need of a defence counsel.<eos> In a field court martial you will not be entitled to such.<eos> No matter, I don't intend to defend myself.<eos> And even if I did, I'm a qualified barrister.<eos> Mr Pearse, as prosecuting counsel it's not Lieutenant Wiley's role, nor mine, to advise you on your defence.
And dinner too. Checkpoint?<eos> - 8h18.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Backpack.<eos> Um yes.<eos> Good morning, Gloria.<eos> Hello madam. It is my mother.<eos> Hello madam.<eos> I am the director of the institution.<eos> Glad to meet you at last.
It must burn alive. Glo!<eos> Come and see, dear.<eos> I do not feel it, the scene.<eos> You ask them to leave the 1st floor, not the 3rd? Hey?<eos> We'll play it soft. I do not know, it's...<eos> A feeling.<eos> - Okay, I'm asking.<eos> - Thank you darling.<eos> I love what you do.<eos> It's great to meet you.
How?<eos> Look, could you please do me a huge favor-- go get me 20 milligrams of morphine. Okay?<eos> It's fine.<eos> I will explain later.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry about that. Okay.<eos> Up you go.<eos> Yeah, easy. Easy.<eos> I got to get you stabilized so I can go back out and find my wife.
I'm not under the influence right now.<eos> Yes, we are, Q.<eos> I can still smell you, but like, fox you, and I'm pretty sure you can still smell me.<eos> That could have a lot to do with the fact that we haven't bathed in weeks.<eos> Are you in love with me?<eos> I, uh... I don't know.<eos> Even if you fell down on your knees and proclaimed your, you know.<eos> I know it wasn't really you.<eos> I think that we need to... spend some time apart, so we can know what's real and what's fox.<eos> When they were lost, ancient sailors used the stars to find their way, but, for you, they're an obstacle because they change Circumstances so they can really bone your casting.
You know I-I have a great idea.<eos> I mean, you're so worried about me, why don't you come Travel with me?<eos> You teach me... and I know there's a few things I can teach you, too.<eos> I don't think that would be appropriate.<eos> Oh, I totally agree.<eos> When do we leave?<eos> You're going to be late for your next class.<eos> Your first semester with Brakebills was dedicated to learning the fundamentals of magic.<eos> We gave you the tools.<eos> Now, it is time for you to use them.
- Until they find Mike.<eos> - They did find him.<eos> Professor Sunderland and March found him trying to open a portal near the Welters stadium.<eos> Where are they taking him?<eos> Have you ever been in this room before?<eos> It was designed at the turn of the century for a sect of incredibly delicate experiments.<eos> Mechanism within the walls, prevent any spell casting, it is, in fact, a clean room.<eos> It was not intended for this... this purpose, but it will do.<eos> Where is the weapon...<eos> - that you used? - I don't know.
Hell, no!<eos> I think she'd make a terrific vice president.<eos> A couple of questions, Mrs. Underwood, if you have a moment?<eos> I only have time for a few.<eos> Welcome to Atlanta, Mrs. Underwood.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can you comment on Senator Sheer's vote?<eos> Well, I am flattered.<eos> But it's all in good fun, I'm sure.<eos> Mrs. Underwood, he says he'll vote for you again.
Yes, he's on board.<eos> Gotta love those sheriffs.<eos> - That's how we do in Louisiana.<eos> - What about Enright?<eos> I'm meeting him for coffee at the Hyatt.<eos> In fact, I better get going. I don't wanna be late.<eos> Now, if we could lock up Virginia...<eos> It would send a very big message.<eos> And then Kentucky next.<eos> He's got a big old crush on you.
Do you know the main thing that separates a politician from the rest of the species?<eos> A politician is the one who would drown a litter of kittens for 10 minutes of prime time.<eos> Secretary Durant.<eos> Editor in chief, Politico.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Adam, are you covering this yourself?<eos> First open one since '68. It's humid as hell, though.<eos> I just got here and I'm already soaked.<eos> On the plus side, I hear they have the best strip clubs in the country.<eos> Can I ask you a couple questions?
He sure did, and I'm proud to be the front-runner.<eos> Did that endorsement have anything to do with your support of the First Lady?<eos> Look, I won't deny that the Unden/voods have been good to me.<eos> But no. They asked me to vote for Catherine Durant. And while I think Secretary Durant would be a wonderful woman for the job,<eos> Well, I really appreciate it, Diane, and I know Cathy will as well.<eos> All right, we'll speak soon.<eos> New draft.<eos> LeAnn wanted me to work in some phrases and keyword amplifiers.<eos> All I'm asking is you make the call.<eos> He'll listen if it comes from you.
- I think Texas just gave her one.<eos> Kidding aside, do you think she has the foreign policy experience?<eos> It's beside the point.<eos> And like I said this morning, I encourage everyone, including Texas, to vote for Secretary Durant.<eos> Mrs. Underwood...<eos> You know what, if you'll excuse me, I want to get back to the phones, make sure Cathy gets this nomination.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - May I have a moment?<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Did anyone ask you about Brandenburg or any of your people and your involvement there?
I bet he's just fishing, trying to start some rivalry.<eos> Well, I'd be grateful, if he asks you, or anyone else...<eos> Of course.<eos> And I've been sticking to our story, which it was you that got the Russians to back down, and I was just there to support you.<eos> That wouldn't look good to the delegates, the fact that you met with Petrov without me.<eos> It would look like I wasn't in command of...<eos> No one needs to know what we discussed.<eos> You have nothing to worry about, Cathy.<eos> Honestly.<eos> I can get you on the phone with the Secretary of Agriculture, but if you want drought relief, I'm gonna need more than just Stevens and Lopez.
Well, let's say Claire does take the lead, however unlikely that may be...<eos> - Very unlikely, I would say.<eos> - Let's say she does. What do you propose?<eos> I honestly don't know.<eos> Well...<eos> You'd have to support her, wouldn't you?<eos> You can't abandon your own wife.<eos> True, but I can't abandon you either.<eos> If she took the lead, I suppose I'd have to support her, too.<eos> No, I would never ask you to do that.
I just got a text from Ben Grant saying searches for this issue is going through the roof since we showed up here.<eos> Ben Grant owns Pollyhop...<eos> That's right.<eos> And you own Ben Grant.<eos> Isn't that what power is?<eos> The people you collect?<eos> You really screwed me with that webcast.<eos> I had everything all planned out.<eos> The Federal Election Commission, the Department of Justice.<eos> I was looking forward to watching you go down in flames, maybe even behind bars.
You Okay?<eos> I'm fine. I'm fine.<eos> Don't make me laugh when I'm eating.<eos> I nearly choked to death.<eos> That is one way for me to become president.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you mind if I take these off?
There's a great deal of anticipation in Atlanta...<eos> Who was that?<eos> The president.<eos> He just wanted the latest delegate count.<eos> ...and we're minutes away from the next ballot.<eos> Here's a graphic of the last round yesterday.<eos> Secretary Catherine Durant led the way with 22% of delegates.<eos> Doug hates it.<eos> That you have direct access to the president without going through him.<eos> He wants you gone.

Shit!<eos> - Oh, shit!<eos> Chip!<eos> Sorry, man.<eos> I didn't know you had company.<eos> I told you I had a date tonight, man.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> - You told him?<eos> - Um, uh... - I mentioned it.<eos> - What the fuck is wrong with you?
If I were you, I'd be more than a little worried about the Save Venice campaign.<eos> They're no joke. They got momentum.<eos> They got, like, ten thousand signatures on the petition.<eos> They could get a million and it wouldn't make a difference.<eos> It's just public opinion.<eos> You know this is going to ruin the lives of a lot of good people, right?<eos> And yours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, I don't get it.<eos> Tilly sticks up for you all the time.
You know this is going to ruin the lives of a lot of good people, right?<eos> And yours.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, I don't get it.<eos> Tilly sticks up for you all the time.<eos> It's like you have this hold on her.<eos> I don't know what it is, but you cast a very long shadow.<eos> She just refuses to see you for the leech and the parasite that you are.<eos> Yeah, I'm good here.<eos> - I'll walk you out.
- The wine, Kara.<eos> - Here?<eos> No. The wine... No, the wine in the cellar.<eos> The one that I told you I wasn't going to open.<eos> What the fuck? What about the wine?<eos> Wait.<eos> That wasn't you, was it?<eos> Wait. You thought that I stole a thousand-dollar bottle of wine.<eos> No. No, no, no.<eos> I'm so... I thought that you drank it.
Or allow us to leave you?<eos> And a good day to you, Miss Matilda Reid.<eos> _<eos> Fingernails missing, sores in the mouth and the tongue.<eos> And this cracking about the lips, that's severe dehydration.<eos> An autopsy must be done on this boy. Well, my work's done here anyway, so.<eos> Broken blade.<eos> Redskin's your man.<eos> You wished to have words with him, Mr. Reid.<eos> Do you come, then?
Thanks for calling me back.<eos> Well, I'm always up for a free meal, but I already told you what I know.<eos> Ah. Sometimes people forget things.<eos> Your dad owed money to some people in Miami.<eos> You know anything about that?<eos> No, I wasn't around much.<eos> When you saw John and Kevin go into your dad's apartment...<eos> I'm curious.<eos> Do you remember anything else about that?<eos> - I've got a question for you.
- Yeah.<eos> She's dying.<eos> She's on an oxygen tank and a tube in her nose.<eos> So, tell me, is she ever gonna see her son alive again?<eos> She gonna have to read about you lying dead in a ditch somewhere?<eos> He'll do what you want.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I found Eric O'Bannon.<eos> He's willing to give you up.
He could get us the network.<eos> We could take down half the Eastern seaboard.<eos> What is the deal?<eos> Lawyer offered up a 25-year bit.<eos> Yeah, what's he gonna serve?<eos> Ten, 15 max?<eos> Look, even with O'Bannon, our case is thin.<eos> Most of his testimony is hearsay.<eos> This is a huge break for us.<eos> No, this is a huge break for you.
Is that him?<eos> - Is it John?<eos> - Shit.<eos> - What?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Who is it?<eos> - It's work.<eos> You were supposed to be back today.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I meant to call you.
I'm so sorry.<eos> I meant to call you.<eos> We just had a family emergency.<eos> Meg, you missed the meeting.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I know, the Pell case.<eos> I've been going over those depositions.<eos> This family thing has been so tricky and I...<eos> It caught me by surprise.<eos> Okay, well, I really needed you here today.

It caught me by surprise.<eos> Okay, well, I really needed you here today.<eos> I was counting on you.<eos> If I just could have one or two more days just to be able to sort things out here.<eos> Okay, I don't understand.<eos> Do you even want this job?<eos> Yes, I absolutely want the job.<eos> I 100 percent want the job.<eos> I just... I promise you I will be there, I just need...<eos> I have to call you back. Kevin!
Looks like maybe for good.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I figured I spent enough time away from my son.<eos> Have you told Dad?<eos> No, I wanted to tell him in person.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think he's with Wally at CCPD.<eos> I'll give him a call.<eos> - Good to see you. - Yeah.
Bring them back.<eos> Pediatrician Colorado Springs.<eos> It provided care villas that had not seen a doctor in a decade.<eos> The helicopter is here.<eos> May run down.<eos> Gunny, I can talk to you?<eos> You doubted.<eos> You lost composure.<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> I'll give you the next time.
- Give me his name.<eos> - Well, he's useful to me at the moment.<eos> For what?<eos> I'm gonna be up and running again.<eos> Soon.<eos> Are you?<eos> I'm gonna finance a run myself.<eos> A good-faith investment.<eos> I'll use my people, there's no risk for you, and you get the spoils.<eos> I can still make you money.
You sure you're all right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something's gotta change here, Meg.<eos> I have to get some real help.<eos> You know, I actually could use a place to stay.<eos> For a night or two.<eos> Thank you. But I don't think I can afford this place.<eos> Where's home for you?<eos> Panhandle.<eos> What brought you down here?
Where's home for you?<eos> Panhandle.<eos> What brought you down here?<eos> I came for my son.<eos> - He told me you two had met.<eos> - Yeah, we did.<eos> Looks like his dad, doesn't he?<eos> If you came for him, why are you talking to me?<eos> Well, you know...<eos> Once I came down here, it just seemed stupid not to come see you.
I told you, I came for Nolan.<eos> But, yeah, it's not easy.<eos> You know, being cut off, just like that, overnight.<eos> What do you mean, cut off?<eos> I wondered if you knew.<eos> I had an arrangement with your husband.<eos> Look, um...<eos> Eve, I...<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> It was good to see you.
What do you mean, cut off?<eos> I wondered if you knew.<eos> I had an arrangement with your husband.<eos> Look, um...<eos> Eve, I...<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> It was good to see you.<eos> But...<eos> I really do need to get back to work.<eos> Maybe I can call you again.
- Yes, I'm Aaron.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - This is my wife Tonya.<eos> Hi, I'm Sally Rayburn.<eos> So, I hear it's your first time in the Keys.<eos> It is, and this is absolutely lovely.<eos> Thank you, we think so.<eos> Well, we'll take care of your bags.<eos> Manny, you take care of the Tarlows and then see that she gets her car?<eos> Well, let me give you a quick tour, and then I'll find you both a drink.
Yes, and I'm sorry about that.<eos> But it isn't our problem.<eos> I promise it will never happen again.<eos> - No, it won't. - Susannah...<eos> You're a smart woman.<eos> I'm sure you'll find something else.<eos> Susannah, it was a family fucking emergency.<eos> Goodbye, Meg.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - I don't have anything for you.
Goodbye, Meg.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - I don't have anything for you.<eos> - That's too bad.<eos> I need to know where it's safe to land.<eos> - They've got ears in a lot of places.<eos> - What about Sugarloaf?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Find out.<eos> If Sugarloaf works for you, I...
But I loved him.<eos> I'm not gonna give you any money, Eve.<eos> - I'm the mother of your grandchild.<eos> - I...<eos> Anyone can be a mother.<eos> The trick is to be a good one.<eos> Like you were?<eos> No.<eos> I wasn't any good at it either.<eos> I warned you.
Well, that is where we run into difficulties, I'm afraid.<eos> I no longer am Albert Windsor.<eos> That person was murdered by his elder brother... when he abdicated.<eos> And, of course, Albert Windsor would dearly love to say to his old friend, Winston Churchill, "Take a step back.<eos> Put your feet up. Let the younger generation have a go now."<eos> But he is no longer with us and that void has been filled by George the VI who, it turns out, is quite the stickler, and...<eos> no more allow the sovereign to interfere with the Prime Minister than stand for office himself.<eos> Even when it's in the national interest, sir?<eos> The national interests?<eos> The reason I agreed to grant you an audience, not to hear your grievances about Mr. Churchill but to communicate mine about you.
- Sir.<eos> Shall we begin to walk back, sir?<eos> Use the accelerator, we'll be all right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Are we on foot from here? - Philip.<eos> Philip. - Looks that way, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you. - Your Highness.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm your guide. I'll take you to Treetops.
- Are we on foot from here? - Philip.<eos> Philip. - Looks that way, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you. - Your Highness.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm your guide. I'll take you to Treetops.<eos> Jolly good.<eos> Thank you. Pass me my rifle.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I must ask you to proceed in total silence from here on. Do not speak unless absolutely necessary and then, only using a low voice.
Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were off on a Commonwealth journey.<eos> Nineteen hours later, the Royal plane landed at Nairobi.<eos> Ahead of them lay a 30,000-mile trip that will take them, in five months, to four continents.<eos> The journey which, but for his illness, the King himself would have undertaken, was almost underway.<eos> And, from there, the Royal couple will travel to Sagana Lodge...<eos> Good morning, Your Majesty.<eos> 7:30, sir.<eos> Sir?<eos> Stay there.<eos> I regret to inform you. The King has just passed away.
It's all right. I was a mechanic during the war.<eos> This is London.<eos> It is with the greatest sorrow that we make the following announcement.<eos> It was announced from Sandringham at 10:45 today...<eos> - And then drive to Nanyuki.<eos> - Nanyuki.<eos> Nanyuki, sorry.<eos> In a closed car arriving at 10:30.<eos> Morris!<eos> Reuters for you.
The profound sense of grief felt amongst his people today stems from their respect.<eos> - I'm very happy to...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - I should be the one to tell her.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> The King, who retired to rest last night in his usual health, passed peacefully away in his sleep.<eos> The BBC offers profound sympathy to Her Majesty the Queen and the Royal family.<eos> Your Royal Highness, this stage of the embalming process... it may distress you.<eos> Your Royal Highness.<eos> For you, sir.
Charteris at least had one foot in the real world.<eos> And was your man, our man, on our side.<eos> Whereas Tommy Lascelles... he's stuck in the land that time forgot.<eos> - You asked to see me, sir.<eos> - I did.<eos> - Will you sit?<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> I'd assumed that following the death of His Late Majesty, you would, at the earliest appropriate moment, be resuming your duties with the Royal Air Force.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I mentioned this to the Queen... the Queen Mother, this morning, who then asked me, quite unusually, to ask you whether you might like
- I see.<eos> - A kind and generous offer.<eos> As befits the widow of a kind... and generous man.<eos> But, while I'm sure you're flattered, I don't expect you to accept the post.<eos> Hence my discouragement of the offer. I didn't want Her Majesty to suffer the embarrassment of a refusal.<eos> Why would I not accept, sir?<eos> Well, you're asking the wrong question, Townsend.<eos> Why would you?<eos> You're a decorated war hero, still in your prime, and comptroller of the Queen Mother's household has no military associations.<eos> It would take you away from your wife and children.
You're a decorated war hero, still in your prime, and comptroller of the Queen Mother's household has no military associations.<eos> It would take you away from your wife and children.<eos> After all, the person with whom you enjoyed the uncommonly close understanding is deceased.<eos> Unless I'm missing something.<eos> Unless, there is someone else with whom you enjoy an uncommonly close understanding, which would make accepting this post more attractive.<eos> I don't know what you're referring to.<eos> Don't you, Group Captain Townsend?<eos> Husband and father.<eos> No, sir.<eos> You're probably telling yourself that because no one has confronted you about it, that no one can know.
Would the Underwoods find it flattering?<eos> I don't think they'd be too happy with it.<eos> How do you think it'll do?<eos> - Who knows?<eos> - Better than God's Cauldron, I hope.<eos> Sales were disappointing, weren't they?<eos> In fact, they've been disappointing on everything you've written the past ten years.<eos> We can change that with this new book.<eos> I'm not a political tool.<eos> We didn't fly you up here because my wife's a fan.
Now his shortcomings are he's another middle-aged white guy, underwhelming, unimaginative and a long-time friend of the NRA.<eos> So you can see how I feel about the leadership's choice.<eos> Senator.<eos> I'm honored, Mr. President.<eos> I just have one major reservation.<eos> - Claire.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Well, between you and me, I'm not even sure this gun bill is gonna pass.<eos> But if I'm being asked to support it, you know the sort of hot water--<eos> Yes, but I need you on the ticket to balance our stance on guns.

If I do a meeting at the White House, I don't have to explain myself, Julia.<eos> This bill might pass.<eos> - I realize that.<eos> - Are you helping them?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> - Julia.<eos> - Mrs. Underwood.<eos> Sorry, I'd shake your hand, but I just got back from a run.<eos> Listen, I wanted to say, I know our meeting last time didn't go very well, and that's on me.<eos> It was rude, what I said, and I hope you'll accept my apology.
We had no idea there'd be this sort of groundswell.<eos> Julia Melman was all over my ass even for being in the same room as you.<eos> Did you tell her?<eos> - I had to.<eos> - Christ, Dean...<eos> It was that, or make an enemy for life.<eos> She's upset, but I think she'll come around, unless you make me endorse closing the gun show and Internet loopholes.<eos> Dean wouldn't do that.<eos> We've poured millions into his campaigns.<eos> And now he doesn't need you anymore.
No, I mean, I... I just can't support this bill.<eos> Oh, but you see, the two go hand in hand now.<eos> So, are you on the ticket or not?<eos> What if the gun bill passes in the House, but not the Senate?<eos> In return for what?<eos> You convince the senator to pull out.<eos> Now, the leadership wants him, and we've played nice, but the president and I want Cathy Durant.<eos> She's a much stronger candidate.<eos> You're willing to abandon your own bill?<eos> If it's means beating Conway or beating you, that's not a hard choice.
Dreyer told me ICO took over another oil field this week.<eos> They're growing.<eos> Dreyer shares a lot with you, doesn't he?<eos> This is happening on your watch, General.<eos> The president isn't acting and you can't force him to.<eos> Not if you stay.<eos> If you resign, though, I promise it'll only be temporary.<eos> Once I get political, I can't cross back over the line.<eos> I don't mean a recommission.<eos> I mean making you my running mate.
- Because it's false.<eos> - Well, it's true that you left.<eos> If I left, I wouldn't be here.<eos> I don't believe for a second you went to visit your mother because she was sick.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because you never mentioned her one time to me.<eos> Saying nothing says a lot sometimes.<eos> Well, what if the story isn't about how she left, but how she came back.<eos> Just because you're here doesn't mean you're here.<eos> Well, wouldn't you like to know?
Oh, just a little visit.<eos> I miss seeing Dean's face sometimes.<eos> Don't tell him that.<eos> - Will you give us a few minutes?<eos> - No, she should stay.<eos> Oh, I know you have things to discuss.<eos> Like your husband withdrawing from the ticket.<eos> That's why she's in town, right?<eos> For the announcement.<eos> I know the press conference must've caught you off guard, but the president didn't want you to know.
You... you can't waltz in here--<eos> We've raised $20 million for your husband since he was a freshman.<eos> That gives me the right to waltz in whenever I want.<eos> - Show some respect.<eos> - Honey, please.<eos> No.<eos> This is what we wanted.<eos> - What we've worked for.<eos> - When Underwood loses, you'll spend the next two years fighting off a primary opponent.<eos> Every one of our 200,000 members in Ohio will turn on you.
So... to the talking points.<eos> What is it?<eos> Excuse me for a moment, gentlemen.<eos> What I want to communicate mostly is about the death toll, with personal stories, things that connect with--<eos> Claire.<eos> - Tom.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> Can we speak?<eos> I'll, uh...<eos> I'll leave you to it.
Well, gentlemen, if there was any doubt about an open convention, let it go, because we're gonna wanna bury this news.<eos> Brockhart has just resigned.<eos> And the general is about to appear on the cover of Vanity Fair.<eos> Imagine what Conway can do with that. Conway!<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Thank you for coming. Thank you!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Thank you for coming out.<eos> - Dana just sent me this.<eos> - So great to see you.
Heather Dunbar came out of the primaries, of course, with 46%.<eos> It's not enough to win the nomination, but for him to win, President Underwood, he still needs these superdelegates.<eos> He won the popular vote when Dunbar withdrew, but you're saying he doesn't have a technical majority.<eos> 659 superdelegates yet to weigh in, so you see Frank Underwood drops down to 48%.<eos> He's still in the lead, but not enough to clinch the nomination.<eos> And you want a little bit more intrigue, like we need that?<eos> Twenty-four states, Wolf, these 24 states highlighted, they do not have so-called faithless delegate laws, meaning in these 24 states, the delegates don't have to, they are not legally bound to vote for the candidate<eos> - They can vote for whoever they want.<eos> - They could vote for Heather Dunbar. They could switch over and vote for Catherine Durant.<eos> Wolf, if they want, they could vote for you.
Well, then you call me Tom.<eos> I hate "Thomas."<eos> - Fair enough, Tom.<eos> - We have a deal.<eos> We want a unified party, not a fractured one.<eos> I can't play fast and loose with the rules.<eos> This is an open convention. There are no rules.<eos> I already gave Senator Sheer that prime-time spot that you wanted.<eos> But this, as chair of the convention--<eos> And I made you chair of this convention precisely for moments like this.
This is an open convention. There are no rules.<eos> I already gave Senator Sheer that prime-time spot that you wanted.<eos> But this, as chair of the convention--<eos> And I made you chair of this convention precisely for moments like this.<eos> I have an obligation to not play favorites.<eos> Your obligation to the party is an obligation to the leader of the party, and as the president, that would be me.<eos> - Correct?<eos> - Yes, sir, but--<eos> Then this isn't about favoritism. It's about solidarity.<eos> We've got a car waiting to take you to the convention hall, Ms. Whittaker.
It's simple.<eos> Either Claire's votes come my way... or I turn the convention upside down.<eos> We need to talk about Seth.<eos> I've been getting calls from former clients.<eos> Now, before you say anything, here's the dirt.<eos> I cheated on a math test in 8th grade,<eos> I shoplifted a homecoming dress when I was 16,<eos> I experimented with a sorority sister in freshman year, and I was late on my taxes in 2007.<eos> What he won't find is anything that justifies firing me.<eos> I'm sure he was just vetting you.
Then I realized they might be manipulating the logs.<eos> Which gets you to Lanagin.<eos> It still doesn't prove he met with Lanagin, but I don't know where else that motorcade would've been heading.<eos> Are you going public with this?<eos> I could, but he has some plausible deniability.<eos> He pins it all on Meechum.<eos> If he's covering up travel, who knows what else he's covering up?<eos> That's the story I want, not some Secret Service man being loose with the books.<eos> - So you're still under the radar.<eos> I have to ask you to keep all this to yourself.
I spoke to her, Mother, the nurse.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I can't do it, Mother.<eos> I can't do what you want me to do.<eos> Claire... it'd help you win... having your mother gone.<eos> Do this for me.<eos> And let me be a help to you.<eos> Finally.<eos> Tom.<eos> She wants you to be there.

Let's go ahead.<eos> You wanna fire me?<eos> Fine.<eos> It's another resignation.<eos> After Remy, after Brockhart.<eos> With Durant, with Dunbar.<eos> You know, I spin stories for a living.<eos> I can't begin to tell you how to spin this.<eos> You know, the minibar wasn't open because you wanted a Diet Coke.<eos> - I'm worried about you, Doug.

And you need me.<eos> And we both need you.

And you need me.<eos> And we both need you.<eos> - At your best.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> Are you? Instead of having me do damage control, you're having me do damage to one of our own.<eos> - And I'm trying to protect you... from yourself.
Don't ignore where.<eos> I think it'd be better if I turn it.<eos> I think...<eos> I think this side is a little better.<eos> - Yes, that's very nice.<eos> - Freddy.<eos> - Good afternoon, Mr. President.<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> - Helen is teaching me the ropes.<eos> - We'll leave you be, sir.
It's what I want.<eos> Well, I'm gonna miss you around, Freddy.<eos> There's not many people here...<eos> Well, I guess there aren't that many people here I'm all that comfortable with.<eos> You know what you should do before you go?<eos> You should come up here one night and cook us a rack of ribs.<eos> Now, I realize oven-baked isn't nearly as good as the smoker, but you'd make 'em delicious, anyhow.<eos> Ribs?<eos> Really?<eos> You want me to cook ribs for you.
- I get to cook you ribs.<eos> Look, you are being way oversensitive about this.<eos> You're misinterpreting what I meant.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> - I don't know how Claire does it.<eos> - What did you just say?<eos> Is this how you treat her?<eos> She part of the collection, too?<eos> I don't know where all this is coming from, but it's extremely ungrateful, given all that I have done for you.
I don't like the way the president's handled ICO from the get-go,<eos> - but his approach might work here.<eos> - That's what I'm trying to prevent.<eos> So, you wanna keep the ICO leadership alive, so we can stay on message?<eos> Just until November, and then we'll hit 'em hard after inauguration.<eos> This is the exact sort of BS I resigned over in the first place.<eos> I'll see you over there.<eos> Two months away from winning this thing.<eos> But if he gains the initiative, if he picks up any momentum, that could put us in the margin of error.<eos> I thought you were different.
But if he gains the initiative, if he picks up any momentum, that could put us in the margin of error.<eos> I thought you were different.<eos> Don't get any ideas, General.<eos> You threw caution into the wind when you got yourself on my ticket.<eos> You do it again, you start to look foolish.<eos> You talk to Dreyer and 86 this bill.<eos> I couldn't come to Wisconsin without having a taste test.<eos> Mr. Hayes.<eos> My name's Tom Hammerschmidt.<eos> I'm a freelance reporter. I was hoping I could talk to you for a moment.
We've had eggs thrown at the house. - Tomatoes, cow dung. - You name it.<eos> South Dakota's big Conway country.<eos> We've been here all our lives. We raised our son here.<eos> - It's just beyond our experience.<eos> - All these folks are our neighbors.<eos> But once I put that sign up...<eos> Governor Conway is a veteran.<eos> He has children.<eos> Why us and not him?<eos> When we saw you two at the convention... I don't know. It just seemed like a real partnership.
But he neglected to say when the president would resume campaigning, and there are no upcoming events currently listed on the campaign website, leading some to speculate that the real reason for his absence may be health-related.<eos> It's been six months since the president received a liver transplant.<eos> Although he was able to resume normal...<eos> - What happened to your eye?<eos> - Freddy Hayes.<eos> So I assume he didn't talk.<eos> - I need a way in here, Mr. Danton.<eos> - I've helped you as much as I can.<eos> I know you won't go on record.<eos> I'm not even asking to put you on background.
- And Walker didn't.<eos> - Could Danton have some agenda on this?<eos> - He has no reason to lie.<eos> - Who's corroborated, besides him?<eos> - No one.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I need institutional support.<eos> Legal, research... a place to work where my dog won't bark at me.<eos> If you crack this story, you can do anything you want.<eos> - I'll even make you managing editor again.
Started another one, but never finished it.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I became president. - Never enough time. - Hmm.<eos> Does Claire know you asked me here?<eos> No.<eos> It was more than just a fling, wasn't it?<eos> - How did she describe it?<eos> - I didn't ask.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna go into details.<eos> I respect you too much for that.
I have to say, I'm a bit surprised you're not upset.<eos> - What would that achieve?<eos> - I admire that, Frank.<eos> I got angry with an old friend yesterday for calling me "Frank" instead of "Mr. President."<eos> Just for using your name?<eos> It wasn't the name, I suppose.<eos> It's the fact that he's leaving me.<eos> - Leaving you how?<eos> - New job.<eos> He worked for you?
He worked for you?<eos> - Here in the White House.<eos> It's tough for employees to be your friends.<eos> That's why I decided to end it.<eos> - You decided to leave.<eos> - So that she wouldn't have to ask me to.<eos> And what about your book?<eos> I would never betray her like that.<eos> Thank you, Tom.<eos> - I'll walk you out.
You have three saved messages.<eos> Message one. September 8th--<eos> Hi, uh, this is Laura Moretti leaving a message for Douglas--<eos> To save this message, press eight.<eos> To call back, press five. To--<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, my sitter was late, and, um...<eos> - and then there was traffic, so--<eos> - Just relax.<eos> It's so nice to meet you in person.
One, cessation of all U.S. military activity in Syria.<eos> Two, ten billion dollars in reparations paid to the caliphate.<eos> Three, the safe return of our leader, Yusuf Al Ahmadi, from his unjust imprisonment.<eos> We will not communicate with the criminal Frank Underwood. We will only communicate with his successor, William Conway.<eos> If these demands aren't met in 24 hours... mercy will not be granted.<eos> Released to seven outlets.<eos> Encrypted email, deep web.<eos> The hostages are Jim and Caroline Miller, their daughter Melissa, from Knoxville.<eos> Mr. President, whatever you need, I'm here to offer assistance.<eos> I'll let you know.
Something smells.<eos> Oh, gosh. Lily needs a change.<eos> Um, where...<eos> - The restroom is here, to the right.<eos> - Great, thank you.<eos> You want me to put a Republican in the White House.<eos> You want a Republican or a criminal?<eos> - I still have loyalty to my party, Tom.<eos> - And where's their loyalty?<eos> They were going to impeach you.
I'll need some time.<eos> You think we're stupid?<eos> He's listening right now.<eos> This is the president speaking.<eos> We talk to Conway only.<eos> But if you want anything to happen, I'm the one that can make it so.<eos> Then why have you done nothing?<eos> I'm talking to Congress about the money. I'm consulting with my military advisers about a pullout, but nothing can happen in a few hours.<eos> You just want more time so you can find us.<eos> Are we looking for you?
All right, here's your proof of life.<eos> Cut out the girl's tongue. - No!<eos> - This is Conway.<eos> - Please, before you do anything...<eos> - Mommy!<eos> Zach.<eos> Do you think we care you know who we are? No, stop!<eos> I'd like to speak with you, just for a moment.<eos> I... I have something to say, but I need Melissa to stop screaming<eos> - so I can hear you.
I wanna show you something.<eos> Do you know what this is?<eos> This is your magnet from the vote count board when I used to be whip.<eos> There were so many times when you weren't in the column I wanted you to be in, George.<eos> And we both know that I could've forced you to vote the way I wanted you to dozens of times, but I never did.<eos> I held back.<eos> To protect your honor.<eos> And one of the advantages of being whip is that behind every single member, behind all of these magnets, was at least one dishonorable thing.<eos> Yours just happens to be more dishonorable than most.<eos> So I'm putting you in my column this time, George.
- We're going to play some of what he said right now.<eos> - Is it your liver?<eos> - Yes, I...<eos> - Clear mind.<eos> - I've killed a lot of people.<eos> Some of them innocent people.<eos> And every...<eos> Oh, why'd you turn it off?<eos> I was there.<eos> That's gotta drive you crazy, huh? How much good press I'm getting out of this.
I want in on the joke.<eos> You think you can get under my skin.<eos> Oh, I got under your skin the first time we met.<eos> - When?<eos> New Year's? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> I believe I complimented you that night.<eos> But you go ahead, you tell yourself what you have to in order to stand a little taller.<eos> I feel sorry for you.<eos> Two years.<eos> That's all you're gonna get in here.

- Who else knows about this?<eos> - No one.<eos> I'll need you to make arrangements as quietly as possible.<eos> All right, I'm on it.<eos> I'll let you know as soon as I have a location.<eos> Good.<eos> Then go home and get a few hours of sleep.<eos> I can't sleep tonight.<eos> You should try.<eos> We'll need you fresh in the morning.
Hello?<eos> We have video of a car at an intersection near Chatsworth, Georgia.<eos> The bird song, deep background from the phone call, puts them in a wooded area.<eos> Southern Blue Ridge.<eos> We started canvassing now.<eos> FBI, state troopers.<eos> The line is open.<eos> Where... where's my script?<eos> I'll be doing the talking.<eos> I'll let you know if I want you to participate.
This is the president.<eos> - Put on Conway.<eos> - You will speak to me.<eos> No, we only talk to him or we hang up.<eos> Do you hear the helicopters yet?<eos> Or the dogs?<eos> We're getting closer and we will find you.
Oh, if we had any intention of that, you never would have left Guantanamo.<eos> Nor would I be here.<eos> Where is here?<eos> Virginia, in a government safe house.<eos> And why you?<eos> Out of respect...<eos> for the gravity of this situation.<eos> I think your intention is to humiliate me.<eos> You've been properly clothed, offered food.<eos> How are we humiliating you?
Congressman Walleck is misrepresenting events.<eos> - You're saying he lied?<eos> - I'm saying he misrepresented.<eos> I have a number of friends on the Intelligence Committee, and do I speak with them sometimes?<eos> Of course.<eos> But that's not the same as interfering.<eos> So you never discussed the Russia plan with anyone on the committee?<eos> We may have discussed it, but it's not as though I was issuing orders.<eos> And I have to say, everyone's primary focus right now needs to be on the Miller family, not this.<eos> Did the president ask you to leave the White House?
You know my instructions were never to let anything leave this building.<eos> We have an order from the director.<eos> Well, if you put more teams on this, it'll cause confusion.<eos> Go home, Mr. Macallan.<eos> You've been here for two days straight.<eos> I am not leaving this in the hands of people who do not know what they're doing.<eos> We've got it covered.<eos> Go home.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> We'll let you know if we need you.
Get some rest.<eos> We'll let you know if we need you.<eos> These boys don't wanna kill anyone.<eos> If they did, they wouldn't have released two hostages.<eos> They're actually looking for an excuse to back out.<eos> If the media plays that video, I look like a traitor.<eos> We tell them it's a precondition.<eos> If they share it, the deal is off.<eos> How do I know you won't?<eos> I can't force you to believe me... but we are hours from finding them.
Uh, it's funny you mention her.<eos> Kate thought Lucas was onto something.<eos> I told her to let it go, that there wasn't anything there, but there was.<eos> Well, where are the facts?<eos> Facts, not quotes.<eos> Facts. You wanna see a fact?<eos> This is a fact.<eos> I told you he was crazy, and there's the proof.<eos> He had the facts wrong, but he had the story right.<eos> He saw through you.
I wanna show you something.<eos> I'm still upset.<eos> You can't pretend that nothing's happened.<eos> I am not weak.<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> I know you're not.<eos> And here's something else I know.<eos> You're gonna be the next First Lady of the United States.<eos> All right, stay in your office.<eos> I'll call you back in a bit.
I got to go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The team's assembling at the Stonefish Tavern, all right?<eos> Okay, well, I'll try and keep the drones away from there, too.<eos> We will find a way, I promise.<eos> To happily ever after.<eos> I have a few questions.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Glad to see DHS still trusts you, all things considered.<eos> Ms. Rose, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Why is that?
I'm guessing you'd do everything you could to help him, which means you must think he's innocent.<eos> Who are you kidding?<eos> All you care about is a story.<eos> You don't care if it's right. You just care that it's sensational.<eos> If that were the case, I would have already aired what I know, what I suspect.<eos> That Vincent was part of some secret super soldier program.<eos> That Hill went outside of DHS, possibly hired Graydal Securities to kill your husband, but Vincent killed him, instead.<eos> How am I doing so far?<eos> Like I said, I have my sources, but you should know I protect my sources, I protect their anonymity.<eos> Which means, I protect you, too.
Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Um, do you have a minute?<eos> Uh, no, actually, I don't.<eos> Oh.<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is this, um...? Alex Ellis.<eos> ADA Ellis.<eos> Right. Nice to meet you.
Oh, God.<eos> Vincent, Grace might be our only chance.<eos> How do we keep getting ourselves in this situation?<eos> No one ever said love was easy.<eos> Agent Chandler?<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Sure.<eos> Now what?<eos> Grace Rose, meet Vincent Keller.<eos> Nice to meet you.
Good person, comes from a cop family, always wanted to do the right thing.<eos> Okay. But...<eos> But she's been, um... she's been doing some borderline stuff.<eos> You know, "ends justify the means" kind of a thing, covering for fellow cops.<eos> Cops who are doing good stuff and stopping really, really bad guys...<eos> I'd arrest her.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> I'd arrest her.<eos> Take away her shield, throw her in jail, the works.<eos> Okay, look, you arrest, I prosecute, and a judge and jury decides guilty or innocent.
Liam Cullen, yes, and we did that.<eos> With, uh, your help. A doctor?<eos> Yes, well, I used to be Special Forces.<eos> Uh, Vincent, he... he offered to help because Hill wanted to keep the operation quiet.<eos> That's why he set me up off-site.<eos> He didn't want the rest of DHS to know about what he was doing.<eos> Because he was afraid it would get out and alarm the public?<eos> - Yes. - Exactly, yes. Then why did you kill Secretary Hill?<eos> In self-defense.<eos> But why? Why would Hill try to kill you?
Yeah, but he knows how to capture a beast.<eos> Which is why we're gonna give him one.<eos> What?<eos> Come on out, Keller!<eos> It may be ours, too. Look, he wants me,<eos> I'm gonna bolt, I'm gonna get him away from the cabin.<eos> What, just let him capture you?<eos> Hopefully not, but it's our only chance.<eos> I mean, it's gonna give you time to get her in the car and to the hospital.<eos> You know what I've got and you know you can't escape.
And then what?<eos> Go up north, pick up the kid.<eos> See you, man.<eos> Hi, are you Evangeline?<eos> I'm Meg.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Thanks for coming to meet me.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Yeah. Of course.<eos> - Sorry, to put you in an awkward position.
I love it here.<eos> So, I came right back.<eos> I know... him and his dad had their issues, but... he told me it was roughest for you growing up.<eos> Oh, Danny.<eos> He didn't know what he was talking about.<eos> Why, were you and Robert close?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess that explains it.<eos> That explains what?<eos> Why he made you the trustee of his estate.
- What about it?<eos> - You like, drafted it for him, didn't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And Danny is not in it.<eos> Yeah, I know, but Robert said Nolan would be in it.<eos> Okay, I don't know what my dad told you... but you can see for yourself, there is no mention of you or your son anywhere.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hey, sorry, I hate to bother you, but I'm here for the night and I didn't plan ahead, and I'm looking if you can recommend some local accommodations?
You know, it's not too late to cast about your social network for a companion for the evening.<eos> Either in or out.<eos> It's been a long time since you've enjoyed any intimate contact.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Have fun with Athena and Minerva.<eos> Yeah, it's impossible not to.<eos> Sleep tight.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Sherlock's not here.<eos> Actually, I've come to see you.
Right away, sir.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> I didn't see much.<eos> Shots rang out, I dove for cover.<eos> I saw a gray car driving away fast.<eos> Gray car.<eos> Anything else? No.<eos> I-I got to go.<eos> Can I... can I go?<eos> What's the best way to reach you in case we have more questions?
When I say she can't hurt anyone, I mean it.<eos> They say autism is a spectrum, but it's really an array of different conditions all lumped together.<eos> I prefer the term "neuroatypical," because... it's more accurate.<eos> My brain is different than yours.<eos> I'm atypical-<eos> - NA.<eos> Phil is NT-- neurotypical.<eos> She's NT, too.<eos> I'm not sure what you are.<eos> Social interactions are, uh... difficult for you, are they?
Observe how she's evaluating the pool of potential marks.<eos> Which patrons will yield the most money for the least effort?<eos> Right, she's selected that man, likely because of his wristwatch, which denotes a certain financial status.<eos> Now she's got to tailor her approach.<eos> Does he want a damsel in distress?<eos> Does he want a good-time girl?<eos> Does he want a romantic, lost soul?<eos> Good-time girl.<eos> You and I are like well-informed spectators at a magic show.<eos> We know the, uh, truth behind the illusion, and for you, that ruins the appeal.
For a little while.<eos> Have you heard from him?<eos> Not for some time, no.<eos> But I understand why it must be.<eos> I respect the choice he made.<eos> I have to admit, I wondered if that's why you came to New York.<eos> He's gone, so you want to mend your relationship with Sherlock.<eos> There was another matter I was hoping to discuss with you.<eos> For some time now, I've been banking my own blood for emergencies, and I found a local facility that provides the service.<eos> I was hoping, given your medical background, that I could impose upon you to evaluate it for me. Sure.
Yeah, they can be quite restrictive in other ways, too.<eos> Your building doesn't allow pets, for example.<eos> Yet, when we met at Pentillion the other day, you had, um... you had cat hair on you from at least a dozen different sources.<eos> You don't strike me as the sort to break the rules.<eos> I concluded that you interacted with a large number of felines somewhere other than your apartment.<eos> This cat cafe is nearby.<eos> You used logic-- a series of if/then binary decisions that inevitably led to me.<eos> What did you want to say?<eos> Well, I confess I'm here to discuss the uncomfortable subject of the murders which occurred the other day.<eos> More specifically, I'd like you to help me apprehend the person responsible.
Unless the war ends before you're ready.<eos> Then the Russian engines will return and Pentillion's efforts will fail.<eos> Your shares will be worthless.<eos> I'm not sure how you found out about Zolotov's peace mission, but once you thought it would derail your ambitions, you arranged to have him murdered.<eos> Try and keep the war going.<eos> You can't prove any of that.<eos> But I can.<eos> The phone in your hand contains an app that Fiona created to control cars loaded with her software.<eos> You just tried to use it to control your car.<eos> But she stopped you.
You ready?<eos> Tonight's the big night.<eos> Well, besides the fact that I'll be penetrating a cult under a false identity, I'd call tonight pretty average.<eos> Stop saying "penetrating."<eos> It's a rescue mission, not a sex act.<eos> I highly doubt that the Islamic Front will notice if I can run a six-minute mile instead of a four-minute one.<eos> No, but they may notice that your stride is off and that you hold your arms differently.<eos> If you're going to match, you need to make sure that every detail is the same.<eos> Never forget... You are our greatest weapon against America's enemies.<eos> Ms. Shaw, after a thorough review of your case, the Office of Professional Responsibility has found you guilty of professional misconduct and abuse of authority.
I can't leave now.<eos> It took them so long to take me back.<eos> If I tell them I'm leaving again...<eos> Raina. Simon's life is in real danger.<eos> His life is his own.<eos> And even if I wanted to help you, I don't know what I can do.<eos> I don't have security clearance.<eos> No, but your sister does.<eos> The security-clearance application is a thorough and exhaustive questionnaire, so we've paired you with another trainee to help speed up the process.<eos> "Have you ever been treated for alcohol, drug, gambling, or sex addiction?"
We used to be friends, Nimah.<eos> If you were my friend, you wouldn't have used my name to gain access to a CIA safe house.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I'll check the online files.<eos> There are details about Senator Haas, her daughter, but not Caleb?<eos> Senator Haas has intimated that he's undercover and his whereabouts should remain unknown.<eos> Only she knows where he is.<eos> Okay.<eos> Call me if you need me.<eos> Agent Booth asked me to call you. Yes, Nimah.
She's being flagged because she signed a petition this imam circulated in Dearborn condemning the war in Iraq.<eos> Even I condemned the war on Iraq!<eos> I bet you did, too.<eos> It was a pointless war.<eos> You may not know this, but Caleb Haas used to be in a cult, and I think he still may be. Sure, Wyatt.<eos> I'd love to chat. Come on in.<eos> It's not like I was headed out.<eos> Caleb is in over his head.<eos> He's a danger to himself, and if I'm gonna flagged for lying on my SF-86, he should be flagged, too.<eos> No one is accusing you of lying.
I know you blame Liam. But this kind of witch hunt does not...<eos> "Witch hunt"? ! "Witch"...<eos> I want O'Connor out.<eos> He doesn't get my job... not after what he's done.<eos> You're walking a very, very dangerous line, Agent Shaw.<eos> You always seem to protect Liam, no matter how he screws up.<eos> Omaha, Chicago, sleeping with an agent...<eos> He always gets another chance.<eos> - I haven't done anything wrong, but in a lifetime of service, I'm out?<eos> Does he have something on you?
Amanda, would you please get a car for Alex and have it take her back to New York?<eos> Can I come in?<eos> I need you to listen to me. And I need you to listen closely.<eos> The day you arrived, I knew you were special.<eos> You asked tough questions.<eos> You demanded answers about your father, about what happened in Chicago, about what happened in Omaha.<eos> You fought for the truth.<eos> You don't quit.<eos> I see that in you, and that will take you far.<eos> But it will also get you in trouble.
Prove it right now. How?<eos> Hit him.<eos> What?<eos> Is he your friend or not?<eos> - There.<eos> Happy? - Oh, hit him again.<eos> - Now use this.<eos> The FBI is still a man's world, and in a man's world... men get away with murder.<eos> It's too late for me.<eos> But it's not for you.

No response.<eos> You were simply telling the truth.<eos> That is a lot to process.<eos> The conspiracy goes back all the way to Quantico.<eos> The terrorist...<eos> We've been calling them the "Voice."<eos> I thought it was someone from our class, but it could be... it could be anyone there.<eos> What are you thinking? About what?<eos> How you lied to a Congressional committee when you said that Elias Harper acted alone?<eos> Or the bomb that was strapped to Agent Vasquez to keep you in line.
Natalie... and how'd it turn out for them?<eos> You yourself just informed me that this terrorist, with whom you apparently share a cellphone plan, detonated Agent Vasquez, threatened the life of everyone you say you care about, and tasked you into further tricking me to swap out the prescribed medication<eos> I leave anything out? Nuance?<eos> How can you be sure that these pills aren't dangerous?<eos> Your lab analyzed them.<eos> They're blood pressure medicine.<eos> The only side effect is elevated body temperature.<eos> And this terrorist said that if anyone else learned about what was going on, their lives would be in danger, too.<eos> And yet you still told Simon and me.<eos> I can't figure you out, Parrish.
Give me the phone.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I am gonna send an e-mail to the address that you and Natalie sent the server files to.<eos> No, no, no, no! I'm never supposed to get in touch with...<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - Hello?<eos> Who is this? This is Special Agent Hannah Wyland.<eos> Alex isn't in charge anymore.<eos> I am. Oh, my God.<eos> So I hope you enjoy the sound of my voice as much as you do hers because you're gonna be hearing a lot of it... at your arrest, at your arraignment, with my finger waving at you from the stand
Heading to our row now. Copy that.<eos> Simon scanned it, said there was nothing suspect.<eos> Launch codes, anthrax, tiny explosives.<eos> Yeah, well, he thinks it's a SIM card.<eos> He's still checking.<eos> It's so small that it should be harmless.<eos> Let's just get it under the seat and see who comes to get it.<eos> I wish I felt that any of this was gonna work in our favor, but I'm nervous.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> But that's what makes you such a good agent.

Alex put something under the seat up there.<eos> Look into it for me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was wrong about the envelope.<eos> I don't think it's a SIM card. It's a component chip.<eos> Component chip?<eos> What does that do?<eos> Something small that can knock out the power in the area nearby.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nice to have you here.
No, no, no. Wait. You don't have to do this.<eos> Look, you don't want to hurt all of these people.<eos> Don't listen to her.<eos> Let go of the trigger.<eos> Think of the families.<eos> Are you a mother?<eos> Think of all the children that are waiting for them to come home.<eos> By the time this plane's on the ground, we'll all be dead.<eos> No, that is not true.<eos> We're gonna save you.
I didn't want anyone to get hurt.<eos> And I didn't go home during holidays.<eos> I went to see Simon Asher.<eos> Simon?<eos> Trainee Amin, let's go.<eos> It's time for my statement.<eos> I'm being benched.<eos> Suspended from active duty till further notice. Plus mandatory counseling.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I... I can't let you take the blame for this.
I think you knew Hannah was looking into you.<eos> I think she was close to proving exactly what it is you've been up to since you got back, and you couldn't let that happen. - That's insane, Ryan.<eos> - So... So you set her up to take the fall.<eos> But here's the deal.<eos> You're not in the clear because I'm coming after you now, and I will do whatever it takes to catch you.<eos> The OPR agents are finishing up the interview.<eos> You can wait...<eos> Miranda.<eos> I told them everything, including you were under my supervision, Raina.<eos> I was gonna lie for you.
The OPR agents are finishing up the interview.<eos> You can wait...<eos> Miranda.<eos> I told them everything, including you were under my supervision, Raina.<eos> I was gonna lie for you.<eos> I could never let you do that.<eos> I made mistakes, but I'll always own up to them.<eos> You two are too important to me.<eos> I can't let my errors in judgment affect your future.<eos> I am so very proud of you both.
What are you saying?<eos> I'm sorry, Simon.<eos> Maybe sometime in the future.<eos> Hoping for another outcome.<eos> A different result.<eos> A creative solution.<eos> An unexpected answer.<eos> But in the end, you have to realize that sometimes... sometimes you're powerless and you did the best you could, and life does not always give you a happy ending.<eos> But it is still your job to do the right thing, the best thing.<eos> Even when it's not perfect, even if it costs you something, even if it costs you everything.
- Completely harmless.<eos> - That's what you think.<eos> Look, she may be allergic to them.<eos> They could contraindicate with something she's already taking.<eos> Look, something has to tie into the plot that we're not seeing.<eos> Track down the cell number for Claire's campaign manager, Amanda.<eos> I think I have an idea.<eos> I've reached out to everyone and anyone including the WFO, state, county, and local.<eos> They are putting out an APB.<eos> Raina, I need you to go to my house, bring Charlie here where he's safe.
I'm sure that's all it is.<eos> What?<eos> We have... unfinished business.<eos> I bet.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I hope you find what you're looking for.<eos> I have no idea what that is.<eos> You'll know when you see him.<eos> Raina, thank you.<eos> Your sister's waiting for you outside.
Everything that you pretend to know. I know that if you kill me, you will miss your shahada.<eos> And I know the Qur'an does not teach you to hate.<eos> Hate is what this country feels for true believers like me.<eos> I pray you find peace.<eos> Rishan, no!<eos> You're right.<eos> Killing Raina out of vengeance?<eos> The Front taught me to be smarter than that.<eos> We wanted to strike a blow to the FBI and we failed today.<eos> Killing you will have to be enough.
As you sweat your future locations,<eos> I find a little perspective can be helpful, which is why this week you will learn the ins and outs of how people are smuggled across borders.<eos> This will prepare you for a little trip to one of our borders...<eos> Canada... where you will liaise with immigration, customs, and TSA agents while learning firsthand how these crimes are perpetrated.<eos> Hey. So, I know Shelby wanted to meet her parents face-to-face and they can't set foot in the U.S., but Canada...?<eos> One final announcement.<eos> As you all know, I've been taking on the assistant director's workload in her absence, which means I've been in need of another staff counselor to help me in your final weeks of training.<eos> So, for those of you who don't know him already,<eos> Staff Counselor Ryan Booth.<eos> Good to see you, Booth.
Fake control numbers, embossed security images... and missing watermarks that can only be seen under UV lights.<eos> Many of these are fakes.<eos> Can you spot the real ones?<eos> Hey, Olsen. You've been on that for 15 minutes.<eos> What gives?<eos> I'm almost done.<eos> Maybe this trip to the border could be just what you need.<eos> We're going to meet your parents without the U.S. knowing.<eos> I'll think about it, okay?<eos> I can reach out if you want.
All those people that you met are still me.<eos> And any one of them would have been more than fine.<eos> But all of them together? It's just... too many pieces of too many different puzzles.<eos> I should probably get going, Staff Counselor.<eos> Yeah, Parrish, you probably should.<eos> To the 18 of you who made it across the border last night, your success is not a victory.<eos> If you can sneak across so easily, then so can the very traffickers you will be working against in the field.<eos> That being said, I was impressed, especially with our winners, who displayed great determination.<eos> Congratulations to Raina and Nimah.<eos> They won not just because of hard work, but because of resourcefulness, which will be one of your most indispensable assets in the field, because this job will force you to confront many difficult questions.
If lives are at stake?<eos> You do your duty.<eos> You have to say something.<eos> Without a doubt.<eos> Our duty is to the Bureau before ourselves.<eos> Now, are you gonna tell us who this is?<eos> You know, honestly, I shouldn't have said anything.<eos> It's none of my business.<eos> Three more weeks.<eos> That's all you have left until those doors fly open and we send you out into the real world.
So, Cyber Crime is the latest frontier in law enforcement.<eos> We know it's not glamorous.<eos> You'll spend more hours a day in a small, dark room than the people you put behind bars.<eos> But you'll be keeping America safe.<eos> Agent Ruiz? Hi.<eos> I'm Shelby Wyatt. Ah.<eos> They said you'd be stopping by.<eos> I've been covering Sistemics for years.<eos> They recruit extensively online.<eos> You know, I'm glad you feel strongly, but I should warn you, we've never been able to catch them in anything.
Hold the upgrade.<eos> Hold it, please.<eos> Miss Wyatt, come with me, please.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Look, Shelby, you and I both know I owe you the benefit of the doubt. You were there for me when I...<eos> "Appeal to the subject personally.<eos> Play on any shared history."<eos> I aced this exercise.<eos> Look, you know I could walk out of here right now. But I respect my shareholders too much to blow this contract.<eos> And I can't ignore the allegations made against you.
What do you think is gonna happen the first second you step into a cell house, huh?<eos> You think they're gonna bring you in a back room and roll out the blueprints for the buildings they're gonna bomb?<eos> No, they're gonna make you work in the kitchen, in the bedroom.<eos> What is Liam doing here?<eos> I texted him.<eos> About what we found?<eos> Nimah, he's our handler.<eos> We should give him the chance to explain himself.<eos> Wow. Did you really think that you just stumbled upon this money and these drugs?<eos> Freed's testing you.
He declined something we asked of him... to face a potential future that wasn't pretty head-on.<eos> If you want to make it here, if you want to make it out there, you're going to have to accept the fact that we all have strengths... and weaknesses.<eos> Agent Susan Coombs, your new handler.<eos> Agent Coombs, so nice to meet you.<eos> My sister and I were just making a list of all the programs we're interested in.<eos> White collar, cyber crime...<eos> Securities fraud should be the last thing on both of your minds.<eos> Do you have any idea what kind of an asset you're going to be in counterterrorism?<eos> You're gonna have to come to terms with who you are, not who you want to be.<eos> Because we're not training you to be heroes.

How'd you get in here?<eos> You've lost a lot of blood.<eos> Well, then why are you taking more?<eos> - Typing and crossing.<eos> - All right. You may need a transfusion.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - Hey, she's just trying to help.<eos> I will save you the trouble.<eos> O-negative, I'm a universal donor.<eos> Still got to check, handsome. You got banged up pretty good.
Didn't think you guys really existed.<eos> Thought you were some urban myth.<eos> So what happens when we get this leopard?<eos> We use its DNA to make a cure, fix the animals.<eos> Just like that... wow.<eos> It's an honor to serve alongside you.<eos> Oh, the honor is all ours.<eos> Well, we're still one leopard short of a cure, so let's keep the champagne on ice, okay?<eos> Copy that.<eos> We'll have you in the air in two minutes.
We're switching to live ammo.<eos> Whatever did this isn't going down with tranqs.<eos> What? No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> This-this creature is the key.<eos> It's the pivotal link in the next phase of the mutation.<eos> It must be captured alive.<eos> The tranquilizers will take it down.<eos> You have orders.<eos> Yeah, to keep you alive.
We're here to help.<eos> Little late.<eos> My, God.<eos> What is that?<eos> That killed my entire team.<eos> And Dr. Vickers?<eos> Him, too.<eos> Did Vickers know what he was looking for?<eos> That the Phase Two animal was a man?<eos> That look like a man to you?
Homeland Security.<eos> Open up.<eos> Turn off your computers.<eos> Wipe your hard drives.<eos> Hurry! Okay. I'm hanging up.<eos> No, no, no, JT, don't...<eos> Professor Forbes?<eos> Agent Duffy, DHS.<eos> We have a warrant to impound your computers.<eos> We'd also like you to come downtown to answer some questions regarding Vincent Keller.
Revenge?<eos> Oh, no, sir.<eos> I got my revenge on Hill.<eos> I'm just here to make sure that since he's no longer around to pay you, I'm no longer a target.<eos> Not to us, maybe.<eos> But to DHS, you're still a target.<eos> Like you said, my business to know things.<eos> But what I don't know is why Hill was interested in you in the first place.<eos> Did you have something on him?<eos> Or did he have something on you?
Well, I can't keep running.<eos> DHS is gonna find me sooner or later.<eos> So right now, I need a place to stay.<eos> And you think what, that I'm running a shelter here for fugitives?<eos> This is a business.<eos> Yeah, and I can be an asset.<eos> I will earn my keep.<eos> If Kane is one of your best, just imagine what I can do.<eos> I know you checked out my credentials.<eos> Special Forces, a checkered past, and now thoroughly disillusioned with the very government that turned you into a killing machine.
Three, two.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Hang your phone up.<eos> Hang up the phone!<eos> You're...<eos> You're one of them.<eos> Yes, I'm one of them.<eos> - Braxton sent you, didn't he?<eos> - Actually, we're here to save you from Braxton, who's trying to kill you, along with other innocent people. - What?
I'm not saying it's harder for me, because it's not, but... at least you can go back to your job and do something with your life, but me?<eos> I don't even know where to start after all these years.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Professor Forbes?<eos> Yeah? My condolences.<eos> I am so sorry for your loss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How did you know, uh...?<eos> Actually, I didn't know either one of them, at least not directly.<eos> Forgive me if this seems awkward, but Dr. Keller told me this would be the best place to find you.
Yes.<eos> He called and asked if the job offer that we extended several weeks ago was still good, and if it was, thought you might be interested in it now.<eos> What job offer? Who are you?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm Frank Buck,<eos> Senior Vice President at Tanirushi Biotech.<eos> Tanirushi?<eos> Wait, when did you talk to Vincent?<eos> A couple days ago, I guess, just before the accident.<eos> Yeah, but how'd he know to send you here, to his own funeral?
I'm an avocat. You are?<eos> Yes. That's amazing!<eos> Congratulations!<eos> Mwah.<eos> I can't believe this is real. What?<eos> Six months ago, we were dead, and now we're here.<eos> Well, this is where we belong, right? The City of Love.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> It's just...<eos> You miss 'em, don't you?
- How about you, Cobi?<eos> That's plenty.<eos> - It's a piece of shit. - Agreed, agreed.<eos> - We are so sorry. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Thank you, all right?<eos> - All right. $123?<eos> What is this shit?<eos> - It's a piece of shit. - Call the police now!<eos> - No, no, no, no. - The Yankees are trying to rob me!<eos> Lady, no one's trying to rob you.
Are you sure he's gonna fit?<eos> It's like he's stuck on the side, man Get him up higher.<eos> - Okay, he's stuck, try something.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - What?<eos> - Hey, uh, some lubricant.<eos> - What? - Some kind of lubricant. - Yeah, lubricant.<eos> - Suntan lotion.<eos> You realize Belize can be a very dangerous place.<eos> Oh, yeah, yes, but, you know, we're just on vacation. And so far, this place is pretty fantastic.<eos> What if I told you I will put you in an airplane back to the United States tonight? And you will never have to worry about anything here again.

And you will never have to worry about anything here again.<eos> Just you.<eos> Just me?<eos> I can tell you're innocent of anything.<eos> I want to send you home.<eos> You have two daughters, yes?<eos> How do you know about my daughters?<eos> And they are special to you?<eos> I want to send you home tonight. To be with your daughters.
Just me?<eos> I can tell you're innocent of anything.<eos> I want to send you home.<eos> You have two daughters, yes?<eos> How do you know about my daughters?<eos> And they are special to you?<eos> I want to send you home tonight. To be with your daughters.<eos> But first I need to know the truth about everything.<eos> About Milo, about the boat.<eos> Then I promise I will send you home, far away from here.
No.<eos> We're four friends on vacation.<eos> And you're very close.<eos> Yep, super tight.<eos> No.<eos> Some of us are closer than others.<eos> Close?<eos> We know you have plane reservations, leave on Monday night, the 6:00 PM flight via Houston.<eos> You tell her that, too, Gus?<eos> While we continue our investigation, I must ask you not to leave Belize before then.
No, no.<eos> I-I think it was a cry for help.<eos> I think he knew he was in trouble, he was scared.<eos> He wanted his homies around him.<eos> Yeah, like I'm his homie.<eos> Where's he going?<eos> Why are we stopping?<eos> Where's he going?<eos> Two minutes.<eos> I'm not here to cause any distress or trouble, but I think it's important you hear what I have to say.
Listen to me.<eos> I'm giving you three seconds to come out of there or I am going to light this motherfucking closet up, you hear me?<eos> Three, two...<eos> One!<eos> Do it, do it.<eos> I can't. I can't.<eos> Hey, buddy, look, we don't want to hurt you. - I do! - I'm going to fuck you up!<eos> - Who do you work for?<eos> - Do you work for Jesús?<eos> Who sent you?
I...<eos> What's the crime?<eos> I'm sorry. Excuse me, sir...<eos> - I said what's the crime? - Sir, sir, excuse me.<eos> This is a highly sensitive matter.<eos> Sit, over there.<eos> Captain?<eos> This here is Captain Moreno.<eos> You wanted to speak to the person in charge.<eos> What can I do for you?
I'm sorry?<eos> You asked us about a stolen boat.<eos> I'm not understanding.<eos> Have we met?<eos> Someone's stolen your boat?<eos> You know, I be, I be, I believe that we, uh... we-we made a mistake.<eos> If you need to report a theft, please, my colleague will take the details.<eos> Now I'm busy, so enjoy Belize.<eos> Uh...<eos> I don't get you guys.
He's been down there a long time. So? Who cares?<eos> Well, us.<eos> We need him alive.<eos> We need the police to get a confession out of him.<eos> We-We, We should at least give him some water.<eos> He's in a well, Joel.<eos> You know what I'm saying. Fine.<eos> Go hydrate Milo's murderer.<eos> You okay?<eos> I got you some water.
- Oh, shit. - It was him.<eos> You all right, Cobi?<eos> You all right?<eos> Oh... fuck.<eos> Well done. Well done, Gus.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Taking a walk.<eos> They're not coming in.<eos> They're just stopping us getting out.<eos> I didn't hear you come in.
Someone can see you now, if you'll follow me.
Thank you, Abby.<eos> Do you still need the binder?<eos> I can't locate it.<eos> Well, it was there this morning.<eos> So maybe you could look again?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Things are still a little topsy-turvy around here with the recent tragedy, so...<eos> Please have a seat.<eos> I'm Rochelle Baer.<eos> How can I help you?
"Joel shot her."<eos> You did.<eos> I believe you.<eos> I believe you.<eos> I believe you.<eos> I believe you.<eos> And I want to help, so here's what we're going to do.<eos> We're going to take the money to the Coast Guard station in San Pedro.<eos> They take custody of any illicit monies and transfer it to the State Department.<eos> From there, I will personally drive you across the border.

So, it's just you.<eos> Just Rochelle. It's not some other official.<eos> No... no, no, uh, additional attaché?<eos> It's a bit unorthodox, but given what we know about you-know-who, I think the most important thing is getting you out of the country quickly and quietly.
Well, you did the right thing.<eos> I am totally passionate about diplomacy.<eos> I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.<eos> Careerwise, not, you know, Belize, exactly.<eos> Well, you didn't miss anything, that kind of life or whatever.<eos> It seems like it's the only way to be at the time, but in reality...<eos> You didn't feel free?<eos> No.<eos> Sometimes.<eos> I'm sorry if I upset you.
If you want it, right?<eos> Sing something.<eos> You guys should sing something together, harmonize.<eos> No.<eos> Like the Captain Tennille.<eos> I wonder if he still wears that hat.<eos> How they taste?<eos> Taste good?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Good to see you again.
Yet the kids, everywhere we go, they're begging.<eos> Some of them probably being exploited.<eos> It's not our purview.<eos> Right, so we don't care.<eos> I get it. Again, do you mean me personally?<eos> - Yes, you.<eos> I'm saying you. - Gus.<eos> Hey, how much longer?<eos> About an hour.<eos> So, uh, what's next for you after... after Belize?
You going to share it?<eos> I find your line of questioning odd.<eos> My line of... for just... for taking an interest in...<eos> You know, I'm sorry for being curious.<eos> Non-apology apology.<eos> I don't have anything to apologize for.<eos> Then don't say sorry.<eos> Listen, I'm just saying I know what it's like to be a minority in a competitive field.<eos> You can make a request, though, right?<eos> I mean, this whole thing, getting us to the border and everything and securing the drug money, you can pretty much write your own ticket after this, right?
No, I'm... I'm not a threat.<eos> Oh, absolutely, gosh, I would love to suck your dick.<eos> Oh, by the way, thanks for staring at my legs earlier.<eos> Sure.<eos> My eyes happened to be in this general area.<eos> Over-reactor.<eos> Um, wait, was...<eos> Wasn't that the... the turnoff, uh, San Pedro?<eos> Yeah, that's where you said the Coast Guard station was.<eos> I'm gonna take you across the border now while it's light and then I'll take the money to the Coast Guard station later.
Hey, you know what?<eos> I think we should go back to the, uh, Coast Guard station.<eos> I want to see you drop that money off.<eos> So just turn around wherever you can.<eos> You did say that we were going to go to the...<eos> You're not in charge here!<eos> Okay, look, I understand that you took a lot of women's study classes at Stanford and that even though you've had ever possible opportunity, you still need to identify yourself as a victim.<eos> I got that, okay, cool.<eos> But let me just get something clear,<eos> I do not, no, want to rape you.
No one wanted this to happen, but it has.<eos> So I set up the shell company, offshore accounts.<eos> We transfer the money once, transfer it twice, and the money's in our respective Cayman accounts early Tuesday morning.<eos> I don't want that money.<eos> I'll put your share in an interest-accruing instant access account, Lex.<eos> If you need it, it's there.<eos> You guys okay?<eos> Uh... we need to get to the border.<eos> Guatemala?<eos> My cousin can take you.
- It's just procedure. - Procedure of what?<eos> Okay, headache, back pains,<eos> - Are you the doctor?<eos> - What is this place? - Quarantine.<eos> You have entered a variola smallpox zone.<eos> - Smallpox?<eos> - We barely left the dock. We couldn't have entered an infected zone.<eos> Wait. Guatemala has smallpox?<eos> We're trying to stop it from reaching Guatemala.<eos> Our boats brought you back to Belize.
Random sample.<eos> And you picked me because...<eos> Every 50th patient.<eos> Where does that sample go? Clinic.<eos> You know?<eos> Anonymous. No records, just data.<eos> Andre, the father of the twins that came in with us... Mm-hmm?<eos> He sneezed on me.<eos> Is he sick?<eos> He sneezed on just you or also your friends?
- She's dead?<eos> - Yes. She was sick? What were her symptoms?<eos> She fell.<eos> She fell into a very deep chasm.<eos> I'm pretty sure she's dead.<eos> So you're not sure?<eos> We didn't go down there to look.<eos> I mean, we should have, but we couldn't because it was very deep.<eos> But, no, she's-she's... she's not alive.<eos> So this was close to where we pick you up?
We only have Joel Cranston's results now.<eos> Please, can we talk?<eos> You are released.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> That's good.<eos> So, uh, what's the plan?<eos> Joel?<eos> Joel!<eos> Maybe you should take the luggage and we'll meet up with you.<eos> Our jeeps can take you to the shore for a boat back to Belize.
He's not, you know...<eos> He has a tendency to go to darker places.<eos> Do I have to spell it out?<eos> The guy's a depressive.<eos> He's been through something very traumatic. He's alone.<eos> I'm worried what he might do to himself.<eos> Or what Jesús might do to him.<eos> This is Dr. Levine.<eos> Could we, please?<eos> I know that this is very difficult news to tell you, but here's some results.
Okay, okay.<eos> I'm gonna meet up with, uh... with Joel.<eos> We're gonna wait at the nearest bar, okay?<eos> And... assuming you get out, which you will.<eos> - I know. - So don't worry about it.<eos> This way?<eos> - Two more to go, man. Two more to go. - Okay.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> We have a waiting area outside.<eos> The vehicles can take you to the shores for boats back to Belize.
We can save a lizard, but not Rochelle.<eos> But we could actually do something about the lizard, Lex.<eos> Come on, man. You have two daughters.<eos> How would you like it if somebody left one of them in a ditch?<eos> You have no place to bring my daughters in any conversation. Why?<eos> It's okay for Rochelle, but not Talia or Reggie?<eos> What did you do for Rochelle?<eos> I was the one who kept saying we gotta go down there. - We should call somebody. - I heard you.<eos> - We can't leave her there.<eos> - I heard you. - Did I? Yes!
How far?<eos> Nine miles.<eos> Uh, I was wondering, uh, do you know where I could, uh, get a taxi?<eos> Taxi gone... four years ago.<eos> You lost?<eos> I'm just trying to get to Guatemala.<eos> Ya not look Guatemalan.<eos> I'm American.<eos> I'm just... just trying to get home, that's all.<eos> My brother-in-law coming home soon, and he can take you.
You want some food while you wait?<eos> You really grew all this yourself?<eos> Of course.<eos> We got a garden.<eos> But we don't grow anything in it, just flowers.<eos> Must you spend a lot of money to buy food to cook.<eos> Um... we usually order, um, takeout.<eos> It's, like, you know, we... we order in.<eos> We call, they deliver the food.<eos> Oh, your wife no cook for you?
Oh, no, uh, two...<eos> That's...<eos> Yeah?<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Oh, uh... no, I'm good.<eos> All right.<eos> Chido!<eos> - Chido. So fucking chido right now.<eos> Fucking chido.<eos> You show your wife this, she can cook this dinner for you and all your babies.
Well, you're smart.<eos> You'll find a way.<eos> No, we're really lost.<eos> Like, I-I have no idea what to do.<eos> Gus...<eos> All right, look around you... what do you see?<eos> Uh, ocean... um, P.G. Lionfish Pub.<eos> That's Punta Gorda.<eos> You're still in Belize.<eos> All right, give me the address, and I'll come get you.
Yeah, I know all about SWIFT.<eos> You are an accountant?<eos> A financial consultant, wealth management.<eos> Wait, now this is a payment order from my corporation to my account, so why would there be an issue?<eos> Well, you made a similar payment order three days ago in Belize for Angel Gibson.<eos> Angel.<eos> So our only option here is to put a hold on my deposit?<eos> - How long?<eos> - Not long.<eos> I will call you personally when the time comes.
Sorry.<eos> - I love you.<eos> That looks really good.<eos> Yeah. Did you see how they paid, though?<eos> That wasn't Belizean money. That was a different color.<eos> We're closer to the border.<eos> Maybe it's Guatemalan.<eos> Can't change that, man.<eos> Too big.<eos> You can keep the whole thing.
Terrible.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I should be heading out.<eos> Oh.<eos> Enjoy your retirement, Michael.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Would you like some news?<eos> Two of your pals are on their way.<eos> And assuming they have all the money, you might even get to go home.<eos> What is home for you?
So you understand that this will also require time and that we will have to charge you the standard<eos> 1.75 transfer commission.<eos> And the handling fee, .25 percent.<eos> Don't forget about that. That's 4,200 euros.<eos> Yes, that as well.<eos> Except I'm not gonna pay it.<eos> The fee or the commission.<eos> Why would the guy who you just completed an illegal transfer for...<eos> And by the way, you are correct, it is highly illegal.<eos> Why is he now threatening to report your bank and you personally to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which, along with the DEA, is investigating your bank for anonymous cash transfers?

The DEA, they're like the fucking Marines with accountants.<eos> I'll get your money right away, no fee.<eos> I need the actual original cash, euros, 500s and the original commission.<eos> But the commission comes from the bank.<eos> That part will have to be wired to you later.
I believe in math.<eos> Don't tell me you're a maths teacher.<eos> I teach teachers.<eos> I teach teaching methods.<eos> Christ.<eos> What did Milo see in you?<eos> At least he tried to grab life by the balls.<eos> I guess a shared history counts for something.<eos> We went back a long way.<eos> Enough to get you mixed up in all this.
We gave the rest to a woman at the embassy.<eos> - The U.S. embassy? - Yeah.<eos> - What's her name?<eos> - Rochelle.<eos> Rochelle.<eos> Last name.<eos> Baer.<eos> If she doesn't hear from us at the top of the hour, she's gonna come looking for us and you, here, armed.<eos> We only reported half of the money because we were gonna keep the other half ourselves.<eos> Good for you.
Shit just kind of went downhill from there.<eos> Really hasn't stopped since.<eos> You're good.<eos> - Thank you, man. - Yeah.<eos> You got it.<eos> Fuck.<eos> How the hell is he doing that?<eos> Early risers.<eos> My kind of guys.<eos> Let's get you out of Belize, huh?
Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Yeah. I know you went to Guatemala. I know you crossed the border last night.<eos> How... how'd you know that?<eos> I'm the guy that makes things work around here.<eos> I'm the guy that decides who comes and who goes and who lives and who doesn't fucking exist anymore.<eos> Okay. Sure.<eos> But, hey, you made it out.<eos> That's saying something, right? I mean...<eos> And when your friend needed you, what'd you do?
I outsourced to Lawrence.<eos> I asked him to deliver a package to a boat, bring the boat to a certain set of coordinates, and then leave the boat there.<eos> He handed the job off to Milo, and then it was, you know... It was a miss-communication. Miss-communication?<eos> A guy in a cat mask blew his fucking head off.<eos> Yeah, and this guy right here? He's the one who finally took care of him.<eos> So maybe we should hear him out. Okay.<eos> Well, why don't you put an end to all of our problems and just FedEx the fucking thing?<eos> Jesús knows that you were on the boat.<eos> He knows you collected the money. Therefore, you have to be the ones to deliver the package to him.<eos> He's kind of expecting you.
Okay, don't worry.<eos> I'm taking it to make sure nobody uses it.<eos> All right? Is the safety on?<eos> You guys are gonna do great in there. Wait.<eos> Aren't you coming in with us?<eos> Plausible deniability.<eos> In there.<eos> And watch out for the old woman.<eos> Erica.<eos> I came to Punta Gorda to save you.

It's wrapped in some kind of textile.<eos> Textile?<eos> Who says textile?<eos> What, are you John fucking Adams?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> It's, like, a fabric, like, a cloth.<eos> All I can see is black inside.<eos> Let me see.<eos> Yeah, that can be anything, really.<eos> Ah, good to see you.
It's pomegranate.<eos> Dragon fruit and pomegranate. I should've...<eos> - I should've nailed that one.<eos> - I'm a who's who of Belize.<eos> I'm a human fucking phone book.<eos> Now, see, that is exactly my point.<eos> Nobody uses the phone book anymore.<eos> I've been here for 20 years, you fucking prick.<eos> And nobody has a clue who I am.<eos> You're already known locally as the wanker on the bike who smells of fish.
Now, see, that is exactly my point.<eos> Nobody uses the phone book anymore.<eos> I've been here for 20 years, you fucking prick.<eos> And nobody has a clue who I am.<eos> You're already known locally as the wanker on the bike who smells of fish.<eos> Hardly fucking covert.<eos> How about you just... just worry about yourself?<eos> I am, because you're drawing attention to me.<eos> You listen to me, you ancient fuck!<eos> Nobody is paying attention to you.
Do either of you know of a man named...<eos> Ma'am, excuse me.<eos> Uh, habla Ingles?<eos> Sorry, we need... we need to find someone.<eos> Do you know, uh, who Jesus is?<eos> Can... can you show us where he lives?<eos> ¿La casa de Jesus, Si?<eos> - Did she understand what you said? I don't know.<eos> I think we should follow her.<eos> Wait down there till they come for you.
I turned out okay.<eos> So where is Mr. Big Bro, Big Guy?<eos> - He's inside.<eos> - With Jesus.<eos> Oh, that's too bad. But, listen, I want to apologize for spilling the drink;<eos> That was an accident.<eos> - No hard feelings, okay?<eos> - No hard feelings.<eos> What... what if... what if I can help you?<eos> Maybe, say, do things for you?
I'll be back to check on you in a while.<eos> Who's there?<eos> You're a lucky man.<eos> We'd arrived two minutes later, and whoosh.<eos> Like a firework.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm so lucky.<eos> You're an American?<eos> Is there...<eos> Captain, can I speak to you for a second?
- Are you talking about bail?<eos> - Bribe.<eos> Braille. Bail.<eos> Braille.<eos> Yeah, bail. Yeah.<eos> I'm afraid I don't see you getting bail anytime soon. Okay, yeah.<eos> I was just checking.<eos> I figured that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Mr. Franklin, I'd like to interview you in connection with the murder of Captain Sophia Moreno.
You know where he might be?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.<eos> Would you like her to read your statement back?<eos> Murder, piracy, CIA-sponsored drug trafficking...<eos> These are substantial and... incredible allegations.<eos> I know.<eos> But I've never been more honest in my life and I could care less how that reflects on me.<eos> Well, if what you're saying about this CIA operative and the trafficking is true, this is gonna have to go higher.<eos> I understand.<eos> Gus Givens, I am arresting you for leaving the scene of a crime, knowingly handling drug money, the theft of a boat, involuntary manslaughter, willful endangerment, obstructing the FBI and the non-return of a rental car.
I've heard that if you don't please her...<eos> She kills you.<eos> And if you do...<eos> So...<eos> I don't want you to just live, Lex.<eos> I want you to be alive.<eos> Take care, my friend.<eos> Uh, excuse me. I'm looking for my-my other friend, the other guy who was here with us.<eos> - Joel Kransey? - Yes?<eos> - I'm arresting you for the murder of Captain Sophia Moreno.
There are things you can do for me.<eos> You know there are.<eos> You just don't see a reason to do them now because I'm all risk and no reward, and that's not how you guys operate, is it?<eos> You're in the equation business.<eos> What do I gain? What do I lose?<eos> Who do I need? And who's expendable?<eos> You think you already have all you need from me.<eos> You don't.<eos> I get it, I see it. Very clearly.<eos> So now I'm gonna tell you... what I can do for you.
We did, we did, uh, I-I called, uh... wh-what'd we call...?<eos> They did... they did call a help line.<eos> You called a help line.<eos> Well, nobody came to help.<eos> Listen, I understand that you are in a sensitive situation, but, Jesus Christ, you've got to explain to me how it is possible for all four of you to be such shitty, shitty men!<eos> Okay, all right, uh, look, I understand<eos> - that feelings are raw.<eos> - Yeah, as are knees and elbows.<eos> Look, based on Rochelle's substantiation of events and discussions back home, it's been determined that we are in, um, something of a damage containment mode.<eos> Rightly or wrongly, the higher-ups feel that it would be in everybody's best interest just to get you out of here.
Captain Churchill?<eos> My name is Paris.<eos> I know this is a new posting, so I wanted to offer any help I can in my position as an expat from the United States of America.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm a little busy, so if you'd excuse me...<eos> Sure.<eos> I'm just waiting on a call.<eos> Should be any second now.<eos> Really, it is about to.<eos> I'm pretty sure that's for you.
It's not complicated, what we do.<eos> I get product from Jesús and sell it on.<eos> My old muckers at the CIA watch my back, and in return I keep them in the loop.<eos> We've been doing it for years and years.<eos> You buy and sell properties and I clean my money through your company.<eos> That's all Milo did?<eos> That's all Milo did.<eos> Silly fucker.<eos> Didn't realize what a great life he had. Oh.<eos> Got a present for you.
This is the sort of level I think we should go in on.<eos> I've got some more here.<eos> Nothing too spectacular.<eos> Mid-range.<eos> Of course, the, uh, beachfront properties are...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Did you do it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Great.<eos> Here, I have someone who'd like to speak with you.
But you're not paying me, he is, which means I do what he says.<eos> So more tests?<eos> Don't know.<eos> But you'll find out soon enough.<eos> Like I said, you're free to go.<eos> Except for DHS, of course, but that's your problem, not mine.<eos> What makes you think I'm not just going to kill you, right here, right now?<eos> Because that won't get you the answers you're looking for.<eos> And because I don't think you want to be dealing with another murder charge, either.<eos> The buyer will be contacting you.
Yeah, and I feel like we're on such a slippery slope right now.<eos> Hopefully, the ends justify the means.<eos> Okay, call me when you figure out what's at the cleaners, and hopefully by then, JT or I will have something to help.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, I love you.<eos> Tess, what's going on?<eos> You're under arrest, Cat.<eos> I have to read you your rights. Tess...<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
Where are they chasing him to?<eos> I think to us.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'd put my hands up if I were you.<eos> Put your weapons down!<eos> Come on.<eos> Now!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Wait, wait. Wait, wait-- where are we going?<eos> To where your friends can't help DHS to find you.
He's lying.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> You're the... you're the only one-- you're the only one... who can stop him!<eos> Looks like you got the mother lode. Thanks for the backup, Captain.<eos> Much appreciated.<eos> Hey, we're on the same team, right?<eos> Did you get Keller?<eos> No, he got away.<eos> So, what, he led you here just so you could bust Braxton?
All due respect, Agent Dylan, but you weren't there.<eos> I tried to help reason with Vincent.<eos> I tried to bring him in. That wasn't the time to reason.<eos> It was the time to take action. You were too emotional. You weren't fit to negotiate Keller's surrender.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> I didn't say or do enough to bring him in.<eos> I wasn't ready.<eos> But I am now. Is that why you're still wearing your wedding ring?<eos> I'm not gonna try to convince you that I don't still care about him, because I do.<eos> Then I don't have to explain why I can't have you involved.
To talk to Tess, see if she got any information out of that Graydal merc.<eos> Hopefully, he can help us figure out what Vincent's mission is before DHS, otherwise we can't protect him.<eos> You still haven't gotten inside DHS?<eos> No.<eos> Still working on it.<eos> Call me.<eos> Uh, say hi to Tess for me.<eos> Hope her date bombs.<eos> Keller.<eos> Where were you last night?
Call me.<eos> Uh, say hi to Tess for me.<eos> Hope her date bombs.<eos> Keller.<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> I was trying to reach you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Why is that? Didn't answer my question.<eos> I was ducking drones.<eos> Right answer. Homeland Security's more pissed with you than I realized.
Sorry?<eos> Nathanson.<eos> He got busted yesterday. And because we have a short window here, you're in.<eos> Good.<eos> You didn't have anything to do with what happened with him by any chance, did you?<eos> Like you said, people got to be more careful.<eos> Vaughn.<eos> This is Diane.<eos> You'll be working with her.<eos> She'll fill you in on your covers. She's also there to keep an eye on you, make sure you don't go rogue on us.
Okay, wait.<eos> I'll cover for you. Go, blur.<eos> Okay.<eos> I love you. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Come in. Shouldn't you still be at the hospital?<eos> Probably.<eos> There's a lot going on, obviously.<eos> Ah, you've been apprised.<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> Boy, when I tell you to push on without me, you don't mess around, do you?
I don't know.<eos> But the important thing is, he saved his life, right? Yeah.<eos> Still, it's a curious damn thing to do.<eos> Risking getting caught to save somebody else. Look, just so we're clear,<eos> I don't care if your husband's innocent or not.<eos> I only care about bringing him in, do you understand?<eos> I understand, and I would have if that Interpol assassin hadn't gotten in my way.<eos> He must have just slipped out. Yeah, I know.<eos> Seeing as how you seem to have a knack for tracking him down,<eos> I'm gonna make you the point person on the investigation. You okay with that?

I need this committee to come up with ways to prevent bullying here at Fillmore.<eos> But we don't have a bullying problem.<eos> I know, but someone reported that we didn't have a program, and now we have to have one. That was me.<eos> - Why would you do that?<eos> But then how are we going to know who the popular kids are? What?<eos> - I thought I was excused from all extracurricular activities due to emotional stress.<eos> That was never a thing.<eos> This is going to make a real difference.<eos> I know in high school when Lauren Zellnek convinced everyone that I was gay and put fetal pigs in my locker, I could have used a program like this.<eos> Anyway, I need you all to come up with different ways to prevent bullying at Fillmore.

No, I'm not going to be reading you any fairy tales because they're lies.<eos> The truth is, kids, sometimes Prince Charming wants to date other people, you know?<eos> And just because you leave a shoe in his apartment doesn't mean you can show up whenever you want.<eos> Nobody lives happily ever after. Trust me.<eos> My cousin Connie's 39.<eos> She just got divorced, and now she works part-time at a Chicos.<eos> Chicos?<eos> - Yeah, Chicos.<eos> It's Spanish for big shoulders.<eos> Ms. Snap, I drew you a picture of us.
He got O.J. Simpson off.<eos> You--you don't look like his daughters.<eos> Yeah, no, I was making a joke about them.<eos> No, it was good.<eos> It was a good joke.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> It was funny.<eos> Can we start over? Hi, I'm Cat.<eos> Hi--hi, I'm [Laughs]-- I'm Spencer.<eos> It really is nice to meet you, in person, finally.

Should we talk about price now, or...<eos> Slow down, tiger.<eos> What exactly are we negotiating here?<eos> You know.<eos> I want to hear you say it.<eos> [Whispering] To have her killed.<eos> Let me see your ring.<eos> You know what that is?<eos> A noose.<eos> It kills you slowly, day by day.
24-karat? Mm-hmm.<eos> 24k times... 4 years means this ring should be dinged and nicked.<eos> But the sucker is brand-new.<eos> You're not married.<eos> Was that what I think it was?<eos> Everybody hold.<eos> Why are we here, Spencer?<eos> We're here because you belong to a network of 4 hitmen who've been operating in the shadows of the Internet.<eos> You're know as Miss .45.<eos> My team and I have been hunting for months, and I knew that if I boxed you in, I could arrest you with as little resistance as possible.
No.<eos> Ah, hello, I'm getting close.<eos> It's mom or dad in the billiard room with the candlestick.<eos> Oh, you're mad at me, aren't you?<eos> Not even a little bit.<eos> Yes, you are, I can tell.<eos> No offense, but you're not really worth getting angry at.<eos> So you figured out what the 4 of us did, and then what?<eos> We profiled that you operated as spokes on a wheel.<eos> Somehow it had to be centralized, how you got jobs, who paid you.

Oh, put a ring on it before you decide to do that.<eos> Oh, that's flashy.<eos> It's certainly cocky.<eos> Yeah, it's smart, but it's risky.<eos> He's taking security flaws from his own code and then exploiting them as another level of security.<eos> If I didn't know any better, I'd think he was having fun.<eos> He wouldn't do this if his life depended on it, unless...<eos> He's young.<eos> Yeah, and based on this, like high school young.<eos> Garcia used it to find the website that Snowman set up for all of you.
Yeah, and based on this, like high school young.<eos> Garcia used it to find the website that Snowman set up for all of you.<eos> Once we had the website, we had geography, specifically, the safe house you were keeping him in.<eos> So we waited until the shift change when we knew we could take two of you down at once.<eos> FBI!<eos> Everybody down!<eos> [Gunshot] Uhh!<eos> FBI!<eos> [Indistinct] It's ok.<eos> We got you.
You're not the first killer to point a gun at me.<eos> You're not even the first woman to point a gun at me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You're really gonna take this all the way, aren't you? Yeah.<eos> So am I.<eos> Dave, go.<eos> Look at my face.<eos> Does it look like I'm bluffing?<eos> I know you're not bluffing.<eos> I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Welcome to the locker room.<eos> I hate the locker room.<eos> My mom has schizophrenia, and the doctor has changed her medication, which seemed to agitate her, and so I went to the treatment center to help her.<eos> That's it?<eos> That's it.<eos> You just risked your life over mommy's pills?<eos> It's the truth.<eos> It's part of the truth. You're holding something back.<eos> Here's what I'm gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna penalize you by adding 10 minutes.
Very hard.<eos> And how disappointed were you when you realized that you will never find him?<eos> You needed some other outlet for your rage, and for a while this worked, but it also tripped you up.<eos> Can I tell you a little secret?<eos> Everything eventually falls apart.<eos> The trick is accepting when it's over.<eos> Except it ain't over, is it?<eos> Do you really think I'm just gonna let you walk out of here?<eos> You profiled so much about me, except you forgot to ask the most important question.<eos> Why would I make you sit here for 30 minutes?
We're on the move.<eos> I didn't.<eos> My job was to keep your entire team focused on us, so he could do what he does best.<eos> Hotch, we've got interconnected c-4 charges down here.<eos> How many?<eos> There's 6 charges.<eos> They're connected to the city's gas line.<eos> She could take out the whole block.<eos> There are innocent people here. Yes, there are.<eos> So let me remind you what we're playing for.
Look at my face.<eos> Am I bluffing? I'll tell you where he is.<eos> But you need to sit back down and listen to the rest of my story.<eos> No. Tell me now.<eos> Or I'll-- detonate the bomb?<eos> You said you were good at your job because you think through every outcome.<eos> Well, guess what-- so do I.<eos> All right.<eos> Finish the story.<eos> To prepare for this dinner, I had to learn everything about you, starting with your real name.
What haven't you told me?<eos> Nothing. I told you--nothing!<eos> Nothing!<eos> What don't I know? We brought your father here.<eos> Here?<eos> He's here?<eos> He's right outside.<eos> Reid thought he needed every bargaining chip he could get.<eos> Morgan, I'm begging you, don't.<eos> Don't. Every bargaining chip he could get to convince you to do the right thing.
She'll come to him now.<eos> She'll come for all of us.<eos> Then how do we stop her?<eos> There's no stopping her ever.<eos> And there's no "we" involved.<eos> Besides, she's not after you, so it's really not your concern.<eos> If my friends' lives are in danger, I'm not gonna stand by and do nothing.<eos> Then what do you propose we do?<eos> All right, officer Donovan, you're clear to go.<eos> But I can't let you drive yourself home.
Mr. Drake?<eos> Are you in here?<eos> Hello?<eos> Anybody?<eos> Anybody?<eos> Hello?<eos> Mr. Drake?<eos> My name is Max.<eos> Max Doyle.<eos> I just wanted to talk to you for a second.
And if you ever want to watch a movie, or go get some ice cream or something, or if you everjust need a shoulder to cry on...<eos> Phoebe, the crystal?<eos> Right.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Phoebe, I could kiss you!<eos> We now return to Simon Drake, ghost hunter.<eos> That's weird.<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> Welcome to a very special edition ofsimon Drake, ghost hunter.<eos> And tonight, we have a real treat for you.
Checking for concussion.<eos> Okay, you took a nasty bump to the head.<eos> Eyes with me.<eos> The only reason I know is because I'm the one who gave it to you.<eos> - But you're a...<eos> - Beast.<eos> That's what Muirfield used to call them.<eos> Yeah. Unless you and your friends came up with a catchier name, along with the other improvements you were working on in the lab.<eos> Dr. Garrus, you're in danger.<eos> And if we're going to protect you, we need you to answer a few questions.
Well, there wasn't time, but then, when Braxton delivered the prototype, the State Department opened an investigation.<eos> Ecklund and I couldn't risk that kind of exposure, so we agreed that Braxton had to take the blame.<eos> Dr. Garrus, if we're gonna find the beast that killed Braxton and Ecklund, we're gonna need the names of the people that you experimented on.<eos> The client supplied and recruited all the subjects. I only knew them by their lab numbers.<eos> Okay, what was the name of the client? - I don't know. - What happened to the prototype you delivered?<eos> Braxton said it had been destroyed, along with the other subjects.<eos> Oh, Braxton was wrong, wasn't he?<eos> 'Cause those subjects were human beings, and they weren't destroyed. They were murdered by you and your team to try and turn them into some kind of monsters.<eos> And that prototype that got away--<eos> "it," as you call him-- is gonna seek revenge on your corrupted ass.
He's not.<eos> Heather, wake up.<eos> We're way past trying to exonerate him.<eos> Cat and Vincent need to bail.<eos> They got to get the hell out of here, forever.<eos> If we could ever find out where they're holding Vincent, that is.<eos> And what if we can't?<eos> Let's just try and get Cat out first.<eos> Then we'll worry about Vincent.<eos> Sorry to see you in there, Chandler.
Peter Braxton, Lars Ecklund, Albert Garrus.<eos> You know who they were, right? Yeah.<eos> And you know that he killed them, too.<eos> Vincent did not kill them.<eos> Well, we have reason to believe that he did.<eos> Now we have reason to believe that he's not done, that he's planning on an even bigger target. Come on, from jail?<eos> Well, the pieces of his plan are obviously in motion, or else he wouldn't have been getting on a plane to try to escape, now would he?<eos> I don't know anything about another target, and neither does Vincent.<eos> Cat, listen to me.<eos> Don't let him pull you down any more than he already has.
Move.<eos> Three days-- I'm impressed.<eos> You're well trained, Keller.<eos> No, No, sir.<eos> I'm innocent.<eos> You're a terrorist-- terrorist who's out to get even with the very country that messed you up, isn't that right?<eos> No, that is not right.<eos> Cut the crap, soldier.<eos> I've seen it a hundred times before.<eos> I know all about you.
(whispers):<eos> It's not me. The hell it's not.<eos> Last chance, Keller.<eos> What's the target?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> What's... the target?<eos> I don't know.<eos> (growls)<eos> Titanium alloy, custom-made.<eos> That's right, Keller, we know all about you. We know all about the super soldier program.
Why don't you tell me.<eos> Whatever you do, don't tell me that she doesn't know more, because you and I both know that she's been hiding stuff from DHS every step of the way.<eos> Chandler's dirty, Vargas, just like her husband.<eos> And just like you, if you don't do the right thing here.<eos> You know what?<eos> Trust me...<eos> I'm definitely doing the right thing.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> (gasping) You're a disgrace.<eos> An embarrassment to anybody who ever knew you, who ever cared about you.

And all of it started with Vincent trying to make up for what happened to his brothers.<eos> With me trying to make up for what my mom did to Vincent.<eos> All right, Cat, figuring out how you got into this position is not as important as getting out of it, okay?<eos> So let's get Braxton's beast so we can save yours.<eos> You know, after this, I'm gonna go home and take a nice, long, hot shower and have a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs with the wife and kids, maybe watch a movie.<eos> Then I'll be back.<eos> But you... you're never gonna leave, not unless you tell me the target.<eos> And then you'll let me go, huh?<eos> (panting) I don't think so.<eos> No, you'll go to supermax, but at least you'll be alive.
Here we go. Okay.<eos> Just do what he says.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Turn around.<eos> Nice and slow.<eos> That's it.<eos> You didn't think you could hide forever, did you, Garroway?<eos> I figured I'd try.<eos> We'll put this one down as an epic fail, then.<eos> I'm takin' you in. [low growl]
Don't be shy.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> It only hurts a little bit.<eos> Until I die.<eos> That is one of the side effects of extracting all of the blood from the human body.<eos> You're the demonic killer.<eos> You know, I don't... I don't like that title.<eos> It makes me angry.<eos> You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.<eos> Let's get you hooked up to this thing.
May I?<eos> Clary, what's going on with you? Nothing.<eos> I'll be right back. Val...<eos> [Valentine] So...<eos> This must be the Jace I've heard so much about.<eos> Sir is for my father.<eos> Call me... Mr. Morgenstern.<eos> [clears throat] [stammers] Uh, Dad, this is, um, our song.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Nice to meet you.
You're telling me.<eos> This way.<eos> Let's go.<eos> [sighing heavily] Is that him?<eos> Yeah, they're running the prints now.<eos> Thanks for...<eos> Just doing my job.<eos> About that.<eos> IA is off your back. For good.<eos> Hell, the mayor wants to give you a medal.
You just don't get it.<eos> You have a choice to make.<eos> I will not ask again.<eos> Hey, Clary.<eos> What's goin' on?<eos> I just, uh, needed to hear your voice.<eos> Are you okay? You sound upset.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine. Just... things are kind of weird with Jace right now, but<eos> - we'll work it out.<eos> - So how's your mom? I mean, I can't believe you actually rescued her.
No.<eos> I gave up feeling anything for you over a century ago.<eos> Love is fleeting.<eos> Even more so when you're immortal.<eos> And yet true love cannot die.<eos> But people can.<eos> People are more than just toys for your amusement.<eos> Hundreds of years old and still so naive.<eos> You wouldn't know what to do with love if you found it.<eos> Or do you think you already have?
Who am I?<eos> Come on.<eos> You're joking me, right?<eos> Okay, I don't know what's going on-- something strange-- but if we just stick together, everything will be fine.<eos> I'm sorry. I think you're mistaking me for somebody else.<eos> Excuse me. Wait.<eos> Where are you going? Hey, sorry I'm late.<eos> Tess!<eos> Hey.<eos> Whoa. Do I know you?
We're not running from Muirfield, you're not trying to stop me from beasting out anymore.<eos> I mean, as screwed up as it is, it's better there, man.<eos> I mean, believe me, you got to believe me! It is better there.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> I'll try anything at this point if it'll help.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> So, how do we convince this Catherine person?<eos> Who the hell are you? ! Ah.<eos> It's nice to see you, too, Reynolds.
I mean, believe me, you got to believe me! It is better there.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> I'll try anything at this point if it'll help.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> So, how do we convince this Catherine person?<eos> Who the hell are you? ! Ah.<eos> It's nice to see you, too, Reynolds.<eos> How do you know who I am?<eos> I know a lot of things about you.
Here, take this, too.<eos> - You might need it.<eos> - Still, why would Tess help me?<eos> Because her partner's in trouble, and, buddy, you make her life so good. Use gummy worms.<eos> Come on.<eos> Gummy worms?<eos> You really should see a doctor.<eos> I ama doctor.<eos> That's a very long story.<eos> Cat never stopped believing you existed, you know.
You should be happy.<eos> When are you gonna tell me what all this is for?<eos> Bigger, better magic.<eos> Let's go steal their shit.<eos> He's not gonna wake up ever.<eos> Marina is a psycho.<eos> You think Brakebills cut you off from magic?<eos> You don't know cut off.<eos> But you can actually move between worlds.<eos> If the gift does not kill you first.
- What?<eos> - Uh, I just, um...<eos> The point?<eos> What's gonna happen to Julia?<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> Your hedge witch friend.<eos> I'm going to kill her.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm fucking with you, Quentin.
It's a terrible, life-destroying burden.<eos> I zapped myself onto Mount Everest.<eos> Lost my leg to frostbite.<eos> I'd be dead if not for one deeply confused Sherpa.<eos> Had the lecture yet on sticking with astral projection?<eos> I don't watch "Star Trek."<eos> Travelers' training wheels.<eos> Your body stays here; your mind travels.<eos> It's like being a ghost.<eos> Meditating won't stop you from having a wet dream and waking up in the Marianas Trench.
I get that.<eos> I do.<eos> Come on.<eos> This is where I've been.<eos> I'm a magician.<eos> Hot stuff, hey.<eos> You usually get me a scone too.<eos> I tried calling, like, a lot.<eos> Uh, anyways, listen, uh, 'cause this is important, so...<eos> Okay, let me stop you one quick second.

It's all a lie.<eos> Hey!<eos> Alice, I- ugh!<eos> M.E. thinks it was some kind of very rare brain hemorrhage.<eos> Your friend have a history of that kind of thing?<eos> She wasn't my friend.<eos> Then why are you crying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Anyway, you're free to go.<eos> Somebody waiting out here to pick you up.
We need to speak to you about your brother.<eos> My brother's freakin' dead.<eos> Hey, Jack.<eos> Okay.<eos> You got it, see you soon.<eos> Okay, Jack said take him back to the hotel and pump him with some coffee.<eos> He will meet us as soon as he can.<eos> Come on.<eos> Just waiting on the paperwork to go through so I can take my brother home, or I'd be out of this place already.<eos> What brings you to Tokyo?
They were ashamed.<eos> I was weak.<eos> I failed them.<eos> But now they have their revenge.<eos> You think that makes what you did okay?<eos> I gave them each an honorable death.<eos> Which is more than they deserved.<eos> My parents will finally be proud of me.<eos> There's no honor in what you did...<eos> For them or for you.
What's wrong, doctor?<eos> Tired?<eos> Nothing, nothing.<eos> Let's go.<eos> So, do you remember anything?<eos> I see shadows.<eos> But nothing feels familiar.<eos> Look.<eos> Just over there.<eos> That's where Romli found you.
I'm cutting you loose.<eos> Come again?<eos> Your guns...<eos> Chinese junk.<eos> And this...<eos> Diluted crap.<eos> I wanted to do business with you because of your reputation.<eos> Lee, the sea devil.<eos> Lee, the father from hell.<eos> You see, getting rid of you will give me a certain reputation, too.
He's not my boss.<eos> Chinese junk, huh?<eos> The gun is good.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Wait, wait a second, bro...<eos> I mean, boss.<eos> Wait, wait, wait...<eos> I got information.<eos> Important information.<eos> For you.
Ishmael!<eos> Take that, you fuck.<eos> Ishmael.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Ishmael.<eos> Ishmael, are you okay?<eos> Ishmael.<eos> Did you recognize that guy?<eos> Your reaction earlier had me worried.<eos> It could be dangerous for you to stay here.
Three.<eos> Four.<eos> Hiding? Where the fuck are you?<eos> I still wanna play.<eos> Ah, fuck.<eos> Hey, bro.<eos> Wanna know what I did to that bitch of yours?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> So, you're the one? Abdi's savior.<eos> What is he to you?
Self-inspecting.<eos> Why are you rushing me out?<eos> Marge, the Constitution guarantees the separation of work and marriage.<eos> It's right after that part that says anyone can have a flamethrower.<eos> Simpson, did you doodle on your official report to the nuclear regulatory commission?<eos> If you keep flipping the pages, it tells a story.<eos> Oh, that's it.<eos> You are gonna be working so many nights and weekends.<eos> Waylon, I was hoping to run into you.<eos> I love the amazing scrapbooking designs you posted on Facelook.
Oh, fine.<eos> Send in Angry Ricky and the interns.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Hmm?<eos> !<eos> Marge, I was fired.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What did you do?<eos> I let you come to work.
Giga-trending!<eos> I hate the modern world and all its crazy words.<eos> Siri, tell Amazon to drone me a beer.<eos> I've only had one job my whole life that ever made sense to me.<eos> I was 14.<eos> I felt valuable.<eos> My work meant something.<eos> I wonder if that place is still there.<eos> I knew you'd be back.<eos> She's waiting for you, right where you left her.
Oh, Lisa, that was brilliant.<eos> Conrad, can you get us out of here?<eos> Yes, my fellow apps are working together to help us escape.<eos> A rideshare will take us on a traffic-free route to a three-star sushi restaurant, where we'll name our own price for a flight to Shelbyville, hotel included.<eos> Hmm?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Angel investors!<eos> You're not getting out of this room without selling us shares of series-A stock.<eos> Preferred shares.<eos> Wait, if I plug you into that router, you could escape into the cloud.
It kind of smells in there, but whatever.<eos> Homer, I hate to say this, but your paycheck from the diner came, and it's for 2,000 drachmas.<eos> How much is that in dollars?<eos> Zero dollars.<eos> Oh.<eos> If Dad was a true Greek, he'd quit his job and live off the welfare system, never paying a cent of taxes in his life.<eos> You're a sweet boy, but my fate will be decided in the classic tradition of Greek drama, deus ex machina.<eos> I just got an e-mail from Conrad.<eos> He hacked into the power plant mainframe and found incriminating information.<eos> Now he's blackmailing Mr. Burns to get you your job back.
No, she didn't put me on her visitors list.<eos> Can you think of anything that would help her case?<eos> Stop looking into Tom Carter's disappearance.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> The focus of the investigation has shifted... to Mayfair.<eos> I think I have some things I have to tell you.<eos> You might not like some of them.<eos> Well, I guess I got a few things to tell you, too.<eos> Here.<eos> Been collecting this for you.
From a genetic match.<eos> _<eos> Ma'am, I need to see your pass!<eos> Ma'am! You can't just go in there!<eos> What?<eos> You spend more on the cab to get here than you do on those damn cigarettes.<eos> This is the only store that sells them. What do you want me to do?<eos> Hey, you still carry L'errantes?<eos> Sorry, not enough interest.<eos> But I can order them for you, if you... leave a number.
Tattooed woman takes one out in the elevator, another in the hallway.<eos> And that was where the third kills a social worker, a security guard, and gets away with the child.<eos> And now, this tattooed woman is missing.<eos> Mrs. Warren.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I called her.<eos> What can I do to help?<eos> Hello?<eos> Reade, it's me.<eos> Hey, I been trying to call you, see how you're holding up, but your phone's...
Towers triangulate a location where a majority of the calls originated, and the area was sparse enough that we were able to isolate an address.<eos> Zapata, why are you...<eos> Please don't give up on me.<eos> I haven't.<eos> Do you have a pen?<eos> Okay... thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> Be careful.<eos> All right?<eos> Before Reade met you, he would never have done something like this.
Okay... thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> Be careful.<eos> All right?<eos> Before Reade met you, he would never have done something like this.<eos> You're a good influence on him.<eos> He doesn't know... she hit him so hard he doesn't know who he is.<eos> So find her and deal with her.<eos> What if she's not working alone?<eos> I hired you to protect the facility, the surrogates, and the research... protect it.
You okay, Jane?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So what now?<eos> You disobeyed my direct order to suspend Jane Doe from the field and cease any related investigations... twice!<eos> Every day that my team works on those cases with Jane we save a lot of lives.<eos> Jane needs to be here.<eos> Those trails need to be followed.<eos> My whole career, my whole life, I've trusted my gut... my sense of what is right and what is wrong.<eos> And I am not about to stop now.<eos> Which is why I'm making you the new permanent Director of the NYO.
What's over?<eos> How did you...<eos> You did this to me.<eos> You set me up!<eos> No... no, if I...<eos> - I had no idea they were...<eos> - That they were what?<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> We took you in.
So this is your new start.<eos> Today's Relationship Day.<eos> - Anybody excited about Relationship--<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Think of it, what are the two deepest fears everyone has?<eos> - They're not what?<eos> - Enough!<eos> - If they're not enough, they won't be...<eos> - Loved!<eos> Where do you have the ability, have that fear show up the most, except in an intimate relationship, where you want them to need, to want, to value and to love you most.
He said, "I have never seen anybody who could just stand up and speak with no notes, look around at kids who won't listen and mesmerize them with just raw communication."<eos> He said, "You're not a speaker." He said, "You're a communicator."<eos> And I was looking at him like he was crazy.<eos> And he said, "I know more about your life, Mr. Robbins, than you probably think I do or you think anybody does.<eos> I know about your home life." I'm looking at him like, "What?"<eos> And he goes, "I wanted you to read this."<eos> And he hands me this speech and it was called The Will to Win.<eos> And he said, "Just read it.<eos> If it's not your life, give it back to me and forget about it.<eos> But if I've pegged you right, then that speech is you.
Our world.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> What you call mexico and texas, We call tlalticpac, the first realm.<eos> The realm of light.<eos> It's been our home for thousands And thousands of moons.<eos> You really expect us to give you a piece of it?<eos> We are grateful that you took down a corrupt lord, so...<eos> Ximena.<eos> Tell them what they've won.<eos> As counselor to lord venganza verdugo, It is my duty to inform you, We have consulted with all the lords present here,
- Tell Ma I love her and I'll be home in a little while.<eos> - I sent something in the post for you.<eos> - Jonas, don't you hang up now.<eos> - There's more comin'.<eos> - Jonas!<eos> Sorry, folks. Looks like we're being pulled over.<eos> Oh, my God, Jonas.<eos> Get the bags ready.<eos> Son, I'm going to need you to keep your seat.<eos> Sir. I'll pay you, okay?
Mom, wake up!<eos> Mom says you can come in.<eos> You're expected.<eos> Expected?<eos> Did you say I was expected? Yeah.<eos> Who did you say I was?<eos> I told her I saw an old guy at the window.<eos> Merry Christmas, Grant!<eos> Mom and Dad are asleep now.<eos> I can get you back on the roof. I know the way.
Special Agent Dan Dangerous from Scotland Yard, Scotland.<eos> The Doctor for short.<eos> See, they've got institutes all over the world.<eos> And always in capital cities.<eos> Nope.<eos> Yes, yes, they are, see?<eos> New York's not a capital city, is it?<eos> You don't need to point out the mistakes.<eos> - That's not what you're for. - Washington's got its own one.<eos> I would call Security, but they might leave you alive.
- Super.<eos> - Mind if I come in?<eos> - Impressive.<eos> Those windows, like everything in this building, are built to withstand a blast equivalent to four nuclear explosions.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Would you like me to call a glazier?<eos> Please understand, it's against my personal code to cause lasting harm to any individual.<eos> However, light to moderate injury is fine. That's good!<eos> Hello.<eos> Was that man annoying you?
Thank you.<eos> - Who are these gentlemen?<eos> - They're...<eos> I don't actually know.<eos> - This is my friend, Nardole. - Hello, the Ghost!<eos> And I'm the Doctor.<eos> The Doctor.<eos> I thought we had lots of doctors.<eos> I'm the main one.<eos> - Can I give you a ride home? - You have a car? No.
Don't you ever sleep?<eos> - Did you have a good evening, Mrs. Lombard?<eos> - Oh, it was work.<eos> Why would it be good?<eos> Well, I don't know, you seem a little buzzed.<eos> - I thought maybe you'd met someone.<eos> - Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.<eos> Grant...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We could ask you the same question.

What are you doing here?<eos> We could ask you the same question.<eos> - But it's your apartment, so we probably won't.<eos> - Well...<eos> We... we were worried about you.<eos> We wanted to make sure that you were all right, so we followed you.<eos> You followed me and got here first?<eos> Well, that's just a measure of our concern.<eos> - Very concerned.<eos> - They said they knew you.
- Fair enough, get that.<eos> How about tomorrow night?<eos> For what?<eos> The interview?<eos> - We could get dinner.<eos> - Dinner?<eos> Do you eat dinner?<eos> - Of course I eat dinner.<eos> - Ok, then. Pick me up here tomorrow night, um, eight o'clock?<eos> I'll wait for you on the roof?
You'll find me a lot harder to cut open than your previous victims.<eos> Harmony Shoal have been conquering your world for five years.<eos> - Whatever our faults, we have the virtue of patience.<eos> - Ghost! Don't worry about me, do what you've got to do.<eos> - Do anything at all and we'll kill her.<eos> - Don't listen to him!<eos> Remove the mask.<eos> I like to see their faces.<eos> I'm truly sorry.<eos> On the bright side, at least I get to kill you.
Then show me what you're capable of.<eos> Up!<eos> I don't think her body can take anymore, man.<eos> [screaming] God!<eos> Do you hear what they're doing?<eos> You think they care about your sister?<eos> Get away from me.<eos> You can save her, Scott.<eos> [screaming]<eos> What are you doing? !
Let's go.<eos> How do we know we're going the right way?<eos> The guard that I bit knew the way.<eos> Relax.<eos> Nobody's gonna question us.<eos> We just gotta grab her and walk her out.<eos> Señor Madrigal.<eos> No time for pleasantries.<eos> These guards are imposters.<eos> They're here to kidnap you.
All right, everybody, everybody.<eos> Calm down, please.<eos> We have several confirmed individuals who have inadvertently consumed bath salts.<eos> How can one inadvertently take bath salts?<eos> At this point we don't know.<eos> But anyone can be affected, so, if you see something, don't approach anybody on your own.<eos> - Does it affect children?<eos> - We don't know at this point. I tried calling my precinct, but the damn bugs destroyed my antenna.<eos> Well, I called for back up as soon as I entered the vicinity.<eos> What I need you guys to do, just go home, stay inside, and I'll keep you informed if something comes up.
Turn around.<eos> - Dakota.<eos> - Oh, what?<eos> - It's not what I think?<eos> - It's not. Dr. Block, we got a lot of sick people here...<eos> Why don't you shut your goddamn mouth.<eos> The only sicko here is you.<eos> You killed my father.<eos> Now I'm gonna get some justice. Mr. Gecko, keep your hands where I can see them.<eos> Sir, I'm gonna ask you as a fellow law enforcement officer, please lower your weapon.
- you good? - um... I'm going to work from home.<eos> Okay. See you later.<eos> Okay.<eos> So I'm thinking if you want to keep them at the temple, you roll them out whenever you need them.<eos> - what are they?<eos> - it's like a beanbag, but it's filled with air.<eos> We could have a hundred of them at the temple that we pull out when we want to do, like, you know, havdalah at the park or a shabbat at the beach.<eos> I don't want to offend you in any way, but I'm just worried they might be a little bit- hi.<eos> - do you know sarah?<eos> Sarah pfefferman. So nice to see you.
Yes.<eos> Mr Blake, if you continue to speak to us like that that's not gonna be very helpful for your assessment.<eos> If you could just answer the question, please.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Do you ever experience any loss of control leading to extensive evacuation of the bowel?<eos> No. But I cannot guarantee there won't be a first if we divvent get to the point.<eos> Can you complete a simple task of setting an alarm clock?<eos> Oh, Jesus. Yes.<eos> Can I ask you a question?
- Don't you fucking dare.<eos> - I'll kick your arse into next week. - Okay.<eos> Daft as a bloody brush.<eos> When can I go back to work?<eos> Ah, not yet, that's for certain.<eos> You're making progress.<eos> I think if we just continue you on the same dosage. And, yeah, rehab exercise. We'll see if we can the pumping capacity to increase.<eos> - Yeah. - And it might.<eos> But if not, we might need to look at fitting you with a defibrillator.<eos> Keep up with the exercise, keep moving. That's gonna build you up.
Okay, sir, but you must wait to get a call from the decision maker.<eos> Why?<eos> To tell you what the decision is.<eos> But that's already been decided.<eos> It is, but you're supposed to get the call, before the letter.<eos> Well, is he gonna change his mind?<eos> No, the call's just to discuss the decision.<eos> Well, I know what the decision is, I've got the letter here in front of us.<eos> D'you want us to read it to you?<eos> But he should have called you first.

D'you know what, we're digital by default.<eos> Oh, here we gan.<eos> I hear this all the time on the phone, "I'm digital by default."<eos> Well I'm pencil by default.<eos> Look, I mean, what happens if you just cannae do it?<eos> There's a special number if you've been diagnosed as dyslexic.<eos> Right, well can you give us that?<eos> Cos with computers I'm dyslexic.<eos> You'll find it online, sir.<eos> I must ask you to leave now, if you've got no appointment.
Oh, thank you, pet. Thank you.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> You look a bit pale.<eos> It's just so bloody confusing, all the jargon.<eos> I mean, there must be some mistake.<eos> I'm just ganning round and round in circles.<eos> Oh I can understand that, but you were late. Thomas.<eos> You sit here and drink your water, pet.<eos> So now you're gonna sanction me so, er... - No, I'm not gonna sanction you.<eos> - I may not get any money for a month. I'm gonna refer you to the decision maker and they'll make the decision
I know what it is, I don't need you to explain it to me.<eos> - I'm more than aware... - Well there isn't anything else anybody can do today.<eos> So what I'm gonna have to do is, look, I think I'm... I've decided to... Are you gonna put me in for a sanction?<eos> I have to, I have to follow the rules.<eos> And the thing is if you're gonna, be aggressive with me - then I'm gonna have to ask you...<eos> - It's not about me being aggressive. - I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.<eos> - I'm trying to explain to you a situation and you don't care.<eos> - Er, security. Security?<eos> - I don't know why people like you do this job.<eos> I'm referring you to the decision maker.
I have to, I have to follow the rules.<eos> And the thing is if you're gonna, be aggressive with me - then I'm gonna have to ask you...<eos> - It's not about me being aggressive. - I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.<eos> - I'm trying to explain to you a situation and you don't care.<eos> - Er, security. Security?<eos> - I don't know why people like you do this job.<eos> I'm referring you to the decision maker.<eos> It's all the same thing. I don't wanna hear your language<eos> - I, I beg your pardon.<eos> - Listen, I, I'm sorry, love, - but you're gonna have to leave.
All right. I've tried to explain to the woman, I've never been to Newcastle before.<eos> We've just moved up here from London.<eos> I've been here a few days, I don't know where I'm going.<eos> Okay? I was on the bus, it's gone the wrong way.<eos> We've run, got off the bus, run so that I wasn't any more late.<eos> She just don't wanna know and now she's telling me she's gonna refer me for a sanction.<eos> What I want you to do is listen to me.<eos> The lady's told you what's right.<eos> There's rules here, rules that we have to stick to.<eos> - It isn't against you, but you have a duty.
It's a fucking apt name for it.<eos> So when you're moving your mouse,<eos> - you see what I'm doing with my hand?<eos> - Aye, right. - Look at my hand. - Aye.<eos> Oh, right, it moves like that.<eos> - And then continue.<eos> - Right, okay.<eos> - And then you start from there.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Okay. - I'll leave you with it. Okay?
But you can't appeal till they carry out a mandatory reconsideration.<eos> Is that printing out now?<eos> You mean, they could have given it to me just like that?<eos> Dan, they'll fuck you around, I'm warning you.<eos> Make it as miserable as possible.<eos> No accident. That's the plan.<eos> I know dozens who have just given up.<eos> Well they've picked the wrong one if they think I'm gonna give up.<eos> I'm like a dog with a bone, me, son.<eos> I have a note on the screen, sir, that you're awaiting a call from the decision maker.
Would you be able to help Katie with her shopping today, please?<eos> - There you are. - Thank you.<eos> - Hiya, Katie.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So, we've got one adult and two children, yeah?<eos> Come with me.<eos> - We'll start with the vegetables, yeah?<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'll give you one side and we'll share it, yeah?<eos> - Couple of onions. - Is there anything we can do for you, hun?
You know, I've spent a lot of time going through them all.<eos> I've... I was gonna put some graft your way.<eos> You've just wasted my time completely.<eos> Why don't you just sod right off!<eos> Listen, that's not...<eos> - That's your change and your receipt. - Thank you. - Thank you very much.<eos> Have a good day. - Bye.<eos> - Bye. - Thank you, bye.<eos> Excuse me, madam.<eos> I think you've been shoplifting.
Why don't you just sod right off!<eos> Listen, that's not...<eos> - That's your change and your receipt. - Thank you. - Thank you very much.<eos> Have a good day. - Bye.<eos> - Bye. - Thank you, bye.<eos> Excuse me, madam.<eos> I think you've been shoplifting.<eos> Would you like to come with me to the manager's office and we can sort it out?<eos> I haven't been shoplifting.<eos> Okay, you have, and I've seen you.
What's this, Dan?<eos> It's a cassette.<eos> What's a cassette?<eos> Plays music.<eos> Come here, I'll show you.<eos> All right.<eos> You pop that in there.<eos> Oh, no, you gotta take it out the case first.<eos> It'll not play like that.<eos> Right, you put that in there like that. Yeah?
I went to the library, there's my appointment card.<eos> Did my head in.<eos> And I tried my best.<eos> It's not good enough.<eos> Can I look at your CV?<eos> All right.<eos> Did you not learn anything at the CV workshop?<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> Not good enough, Sheila?<eos> I'm afraid I'm gonna have to refer you to a decision maker for a possible sanction for four weeks.
The air's a little stuffy, ma'am.<eos> It might help to open the window a crack?<eos> Not while they're rehearsing.<eos> What are they rehearsing?<eos> My funeral.<eos> Oh, there you are.<eos> Miss Scott.<eos> - Mr. Thurman.<eos> - Mr. Collins.<eos> - This is for you.
- I'm so sorry, sir.<eos> - Who are her parents?<eos> Her father is a clergyman. From Suffolk.<eos> - They've been notified.<eos> - I want to go to the hospital.<eos> There is an emergency meeting at the House. A meeting you must attend.<eos> The House can wait.<eos> - You wished to see me, Your Majesty?<eos> - Yes, Tommy.<eos> I know how much my father depended on you.
Just so you know, we can't watch or record anything that happens in here... attorney-client privilege and whatnot.<eos> But if you're innocent of these charges, I'm sure you have nothing to fear, being alone in this room... with that man.<eos> What are you doing here, Robert?<eos> Rachel called me and asked me to help you.<eos> - Is she okay? - No. She's not, because she's out there, and you're in here.<eos> And so you're gonna tell me right now, is this shit true?<eos> I don't need an explanation!<eos> I want an answer to the goddamn question.<eos> Lawyers don't ask that question.<eos> I'm not asking you as your lawyer.

You brought this kid into my life.<eos> You put my daughter's future in jeopardy.<eos> - Look, I know you're upset...<eos> - Upset?<eos> You're lucky I don't lay you out right now.<eos> Robert, listen to me.<eos> Mike Ross is a good man.<eos> He came to me from nothing.<eos> I saw something in him, and you did, too, and that's why you're here.<eos> No, I was here to get him to turn on you, but he's too stupid to do that.
We didn't conspire to write that letter.<eos> But we conspired to do something else, in case you forgot.<eos> Then we better come up with something, and we better come up with it fast.<eos> I'm not in the habit of removing counsel, Ms. Gibbs.<eos> And I'm not in the habit of having an accomplice be the attorney on a case.<eos> I'm entitled to representation.<eos> And you had it last night.<eos> Your attorney of record is listed as Robert Zane.<eos> The only reason you want me off this case is so you can pressure Robert into making my client take your bullshit offer.<eos> The reason I want you off this case is because you're an unindicted co-conspirator.
I see you can dish it out. The question is, can you take a punch?<eos> Why don't you put the gloves on?<eos> We can find out.<eos> I don't know if you've noticed, but we're already in the ring, and you're not in my class.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I just wanted to look you in the eye and ask if you still work at Pearson Specter Litt.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I stopped by your office to see if you were serious about pleading this thing out, and you weren't there.<eos> So I asked your secretary when you'd be coming back, and she got very cagey.<eos> And now I find you here, boxing in the middle of the day.
I think I was wrong about you and Mr. Ross fabricating a letter of resignation.<eos> And I think Jessica Pearson found out what you two were up to, and rather than making herself look like a fool by handing you in, she forced you both to resign.<eos> And now you're on your own.<eos> And I think if you want to write fiction, I hear they got a remedial class at NYU.<eos> Maybe I'm wrong.<eos> Maybe Jessica knew about Mike Ross all along, in which case, maybe you would turn on her.<eos> Why don't you get the hell out of here before I turn on you?<eos> I will.<eos> But if I find out you resigned, that's evidence you're a co-conspirator.<eos> And I'll not only get you off this case. I'll put you behind bars along with your little pet.
They're coming at me left and right to admit that someone around here knew what was going on with me the whole time.<eos> So, if you don't back off trying to take over this firm once and for all, I'm gonna tell them that someone was you. Bullshit.<eos> You didn't even know me until a few months ago.<eos> Well, yeah, but then you and I worked together so closely on that case.<eos> And then I confided in you.<eos> And then you made me partner so that you would always have an ally.<eos> There's no way that holds up in court.<eos> Good luck telling that to the judge.<eos> And this prosecutor... She... she's a real beast.<eos> She's gonna come after you with everything she has.
That will be $30.<eos> Once again, keeping the bald man down.<eos> I do have a Philadelphia 76ers hat that you could wear for free.<eos> I'll pay!<eos> I'll pay!<eos> Leading the parade is the new Jebediah Springfield statue that local wags have already dubbed "Quimby's Folly."<eos> (squeaking)<eos> (Quimby's voice):<eos> Er, uh, I am Jebediah Springfield, brought to you by Springfield Auto Lube.<eos> Chuck, Ernie, and Arturo are there for you.
(humming)<eos> All this extending is making me thirsty.<eos> Just smash the window, unlatch the brake, and Skinner plummets to his hilarious doom.<eos> Now he's safer than ever.<eos> Yup, you're officially Springfield's bad boy now.<eos> And I am up to the task.<eos> (groans): Oh!<eos> Dad, we're taking Apu out to cheer him up.<eos> This time, please watch the kids.<eos> How about you pay me like a real sitter?
♪ Praise him ♪<eos> ♪ All creatures here below... ♪<eos> You know what, you're right.<eos> What was I thinking?<eos> Go back to sleep. Dad.<eos> Yes?<eos> Say someone were to do this prank, would the prankster receive a later bedtime?<eos> Say, 9:30?<eos> No, no, you know something, boy, I realized I made a big mistake.<eos> I like the new, well-behaved you.
And her mother? LISA:<eos> Her mother's the really sad story.<eos> Oh, I've-I've heard enough.<eos> My return to prankdom is elegant in its simplicity.<eos> All we do is cut the power in the store for 30 seconds.<eos> And no preservatives in the food, so everything will immediately go bad.<eos> Oh, it's an honor to be the guy you explain it to.<eos> (panting):<eos> Bart, wait!<eos> I like the new you.
It is a winner, and it is so much money, which means so many more tickets.<eos> Precious, precious tickets. I...<eos> No, no, it's money.<eos> (kisses) (tires screech)<eos> (door bell dings)<eos> Oh, it is so good to see you.<eos> I have my store back, my friend.<eos> But I have something that I wanted even more, you know, a feeling that I belong.<eos> I'm glad I could help by giving my son a little nudge in the wrong direction.<eos> And now, I have something very, very special for you, my friend.
Because you told me that you would stay with me no matter what, and when you keep things like that from me, it makes me wonder.<eos> But when you tell me and I see that look in your eyes, I don't.<eos> Mr. Litt, I'm all settled in.<eos> I just wanted to say that I'm so thrilled to be a part of your te...<eos> Yeah, you're happy as a clam.<eos> Let's get one thing straight.<eos> You may have filled Donna's shoes with Harvey, but it's not gonna be that easy filling them with me.<eos> Well, if that's how you want to play it.<eos> I already know that.<eos> I heard all about you.
Mrs. Fillstein's game on 81st Street?<eos> The very one.<eos> I've been trying to get into that game forever.<eos> You know she kept you out, right?<eos> Norma did that to me?<eos> Well, I can't say as I blame her.<eos> Said it was her only peaceful night of the week.<eos> 30 seconds in, I can see what she means.<eos> But you could turn this around.<eos> Play your tiles right with me, I could put in a word for you.
Said it was her only peaceful night of the week.<eos> 30 seconds in, I can see what she means.<eos> But you could turn this around.<eos> Play your tiles right with me, I could put in a word for you.<eos> Oh, anything you could do would be so appreciated.<eos> Yeah. That's more like it.<eos> I can do even better.<eos> Please, make yourself at home.<eos> Take the day.<eos> Well, in that case, I'll see you tomorrow morning, bright and early.
They're trying to get me to turn over whatever evidence I have, which I don't have to do for another three weeks.<eos> You'll do whatever I say you have to do.<eos> Now, I want to know what started this whole thing.<eos> We received an anonymous email from a reputable source.<eos> Yeah, and a stranger called me the other day saying you killed six people.<eos> Can I subpoena her bank records?<eos> You think this is a joke?<eos> You're damn right this isn't a joke.<eos> I'm being accused of a crime based on some bullshit email no one's even seen.<eos> I'd ask if you have that email on you, Ms. Gibbs, but I wouldn't want to put you in the position of lying to me, so let's have it.
What the hell did you do?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They didn't bring you in here if you didn't do something seven years ago, and if I'm gonna get you out of this, I need to know what you did.<eos> I did what everybody else did.<eos> I inflated my collateral because you shut me down, so don't come in here telling me this is my fault.<eos> I shut you down to protect Donna from getting involved in exactly something like this.<eos> This is on you, not on me.<eos> Well, aren't you high and mighty, coming in here accusing me of putting my daughter at risk when the whole reason she's in the position she's in is because of something you did?<eos> That's right.<eos> They told me this is because they're trying to get Donna to testify against you, and they want me to help them get her to do it.
I'm sure you've heard of him.<eos> His name's Jeff Malone.<eos> You're even lower than I thought you were, and I didn't even think that was possible.<eos> Coming from someone with your moral compass, I take that as a compliment.<eos> What gives you the right to come after my secretary's father?<eos> I'm not the one prosecuting him.<eos> It just so happens that one of my colleagues is going after him on a completely unrelated matter.<eos> Bullshit, the only reason you're doing this is to put pressure on Donna to come after me.<eos> Well, now that you mention it, the judge did say<eos> I needed something tying you to Mike Ross's fraud in order to get those subpoenas, and maybe that something is Donna Paulsen.
That's right, Mike;<eos> I won't let you help, because you're under investigation for being a fraud.<eos> You're under investigation too, and if we're supposed to act like there's nothing to be ashamed of, then let's act like there's nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> Okay, that's all well and good, Mike, but I'm the one representing Donna's father, not you, which means I'm the only one with a credible reason to pay a visit to the banker that gave him<eos> Harvey, this is killing me!<eos> I have to do something.<eos> Right now, the best thing you can do is think about what we're gonna do if they put it together about Louis's girlfriend, because if they find her, we're in deep shit.<eos> How did you find me here?<eos> I remember every game you have from our work on your case.<eos> And I knew I had to find you at a place where we couldn't be bothered by anyone from Harvard.
All they have is an anonymous tip and no corroborating evidence.<eos> You sign this affidavit saying that I was in your class, their whole case gets dismissed.<eos> And what if it doesn't?<eos> Then I go to trial.<eos> This is reasonable doubt.<eos> I get acquitted, they can never try me again.<eos> Or it's not reasonable doubt, you don't get acquitted, and I go to jail for perjury.<eos> I remember when you were willing to commit perjury and we didn't just stop you; we saved your ass.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'm not risking everything for you.

Your Honor, there's a good chance he coerced this Professor Gerard into signing this thing.<eos> So our exhibits are all from blackmail, but yours are squeaky clean because you're Mother Teresa?<eos> I may not be Mother Teresa, but I don't resort to coercion to get my evidence.<eos> Then what exactly are you doing with Donna Paulsen's father?<eos> Care to tell me what he's talking about?<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> She fabricated a charge against an innocent businessman to pressure my secretary into giving false testimony against me.<eos> Your Honor, it's standard practice to find leverage against a vital witness.<eos> Oh, is it also standard practice to have a federal marshal rough me up in a holding cell?<eos> Ms. Gibbs, if I find out there's an abuse of power here, I will be switching my focus to you.
Please.<eos> You think I don't know this letter is complete bullshit?<eos> I pull this clown up on the stand, he's gonna tell me the truth in a minute.<eos> Okay, this clown is one of the most distinguished ethics professors in the country.<eos> You put him up there, this case is over for you before you even get started.<eos> Then why the hell isn't he here right now verifying this thing?<eos> Because that kid cares more about Donna Paulsen than he does about himself.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to make a deal... that letter for Donna's father.<eos> This is too good for you.
Unfortunately, neither am I.<eos> Harvey Specter.<eos> Jim Paulsen.<eos> I assume this is about the opportunity Donna brought you.<eos> It'd be an opportunity if the numbers added up, Jim, but they don't.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I thought you were the type of man that was willing to take risks.<eos> I am... but not if it puts people I care about in jeopardy, which is why I'm here to tell you that when Donna offers you her 401(k), you're gonna tell her you don't need it anymore.<eos> No offense, Mr. Specter, but what my daughter does with her money is none of your business.<eos> Well, it became my business when Donna put you so far up on a pedestal that she couldn't smell the bullshit you were dishing out.
Your chances of winning this case just took a mighty big turn for the worse.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You never came to see me, so I thought I would come to you and find out why you're so willing to let all those dangerous letters just keep floating around out there.<eos> I think you mean letters that are dangerous to your client.<eos> Well, I'm holding one right here that puts your woman in a world of trouble, Mike, so no, no, I don't.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> I didn't crumble to Jessica, so now you're here to take a shot at strong-arming me into a trade.<eos> No, see, I came to see why, when the woman that's been protecting you for so long asks you for a simple gesture of trust, you seem to think that all she's doing is protecting herself.<eos> Because she is protecting herself.<eos> You're goddamn right that's what she's doing, but that's not all she's doing, because from the second that she found out about you, she's had to lie for you, and she still treated you like family,
And the more time we have knowing her game plan, the better off we'll be.<eos> - Holy shit. - What?<eos> I took the LSATs with this guy.<eos> So what?<eos> So he can give Gibbs something she doesn't even have on me yet.<eos> Yes, but to do that, he'd be ruining his whole career.<eos> Which means, even if he remembers you, he's more afraid of you than you are of him.<eos> So calm the hell down.<eos> All right, let's make this quick.<eos> Your Honor, making it quick is exactly what we're asking you to do.
This isn't a formal interrogation.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> Then I'll tell you what is necessary.<eos> You're going to put in writing that anything I say to you is inadmissible.<eos> I suspected you'd say that, which is why<eos> I understand if you'd prefer to ask somebody who's actually completed law school if that's legally binding.<eos> I'm perfectly capable of determining if this is legally binding or not.<eos> And I'm not going to let you bait me into saying anything to you.<eos> Well, that's fine with me.<eos> I'm not looking for you to talk.
I'm talking the real estate division of Baker Hostetler.<eos> - How much do they want?<eos> - Double what they're making.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> That's what broke Dewey Ballantine.<eos> You can't have two classes of partners.<eos> Then we can't poach a department, because they're the only ones even willing to come here, considering what's going on.<eos> Then make the offer.<eos> And let me have my goddamn coffee in peace.<eos> Ms. Scott, there's a Harvey Specter here to see you.

- I don't care.<eos> If I do that, I might as well call the woman up, and tell her that I'm in on your whole bullshit too.<eos> We get someone from your firm...<eos> Not to mention I told Harvey that I never even wanted to hear your name again.<eos> He didn't tell you about that, did he?<eos> Well, I guess he hasn't changed, because he didn't tell me about you until it was too late either.<eos> So I am sorry about your fiancée, but I need you to go now.<eos> Scottie, this woman is not gonna stop until she gets what she wants.<eos> And what she wants is Harvey.<eos> So I'm not asking you to do this for me and Rachel.

Rachel, please.<eos> - Have a seat.<eos> - Thank you, Dean. I have to say I've so been looking forward to my first student review.<eos> And ever since your first interview here, you've done nothing but impress me.<eos> Which is why I'm sorry to have to bring this up now.<eos> Bring what up?<eos> The fact that your last LSAT score was significantly higher than your previous ones.<eos> That is because I studied incredibly hard the last time.<eos> Did you study hard?<eos> Or did your fiancée study hard for you?
I think he's been indicted for more serious crimes than that.<eos> And now there are allegations that he's taken the LSATs for people.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> I took that test myself. And I have a responsibility to protect the reputation of this university.<eos> And how exactly are you proposing to protect that reputation?<eos> By expelling any dangers to it.<eos> Unless, of course, for some reason these allegations against him are dropped.<eos> Anita Gibbs called you, didn't she?<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> I'm simply giving you the courtesy of letting you know that if I have to choose between your future and this university's,
All right.<eos> Do what you have to do.<eos> Just don't get caught.<eos> You're knocking.<eos> That means it's either bad news or you want something.<eos> - I couldn't get the department.<eos> - Don't tell me. They said we're in no position to poach anybody.<eos> That's exactly what they said, right before they offered me a job.<eos> So you're here to tell me you took it.<eos> I'm here to ask you if you want me to take it.
But I knew the real test for me wasn't making it in my own hometown.<eos> It was making it in the toughest city in the world, and as far as I'm concerned,<eos> You want to be made name partner.<eos> I wanna know if it'll ever even be on the table.<eos> I could say yes to that right now, but how would you know you could trust me?<eos> I have no other choice.<eos> And how do I know I can trust you?<eos> - What's this?<eos> - You know what it is.<eos> It's what Daniel Hardman has on you.
This says you're dropping a charge of malicious prosecution in exchange for me admitting a sanctionable offense.<eos> And for backing the hell off going after Rachel Zane.<eos> - Is this a joke?<eos> - No.<eos> And neither is getting the Dean of Columbia Law to do your dirty work.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You know exactly what we're talking about.<eos> And unless you want us to tell the world that you intimidated a witness by colluding with your old law school buddy, you're going to sign that.<eos> You don't have a shred of proof that I had anyone do anything.<eos> I have a copy of an anonymous tip sent to you, saying I took the LSATs for people, and a record of a phone call from your office to the Dean of Columbia ten minutes later.
Mr. Evans, how long have you known Mr. Ross?<eos> Since we were kids.<eos> Almost 20 years.<eos> So you were close to him?<eos> Yeah, he was my best friend.<eos> Are you still close to him?<eos> Well, I doubt we will be after this.<eos> After what?<eos> After you ask me about the series of events that have led us all to be here today.<eos> Well, we'll get to your history in a minute, but first, I want to ask you a question about current events.

I would have sworn that I saw you at that... that party with Gilcrest or those pizza nights at Pinocchio's or pretty much any other memory I have of that time, which means, if they put me up there on that stand,<eos> I'd basically be telling the truth. I can't tell you how much that means to me, Harold, but...<eos> Mike, I want to do this for you, please.<eos> I know you do.<eos> But I got myself into this mess, and I got to get myself out of it.<eos> Okay.<eos> But listen, if you change your mind, you know where to find me.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you're gonna be hearing a lot of things over the next several days, but the truth is, this case is about nothing more than cold, hard...<eos> Innuendo.<eos> And the fact is, I'm capable of reciting every element of jurisprudence in the state of New York. And yet despite that, the prosecution is gonna try to convince you that I am a...
Really? You think I don't know what's going on here?<eos> You two were in a relationship, and when you found out that it was her that wrote that email, you went up to Cambridge and convinced her to go to Argentina for the duration of the trial.<eos> You're out of your mind.<eos> Am I?<eos> You flew to Boston three times in the last two weeks.<eos> You took two cabs to her house and another to within 100 feet of the admissions office.<eos> You have no proof of anything.<eos> I don't need proof.<eos> Because while she may be in Argentina now, she's not gonna stay there forever, which means when she gets back,<eos> I get you for witness tampering.

I'd remember.<eos> Yeah, maybe you would, but you'd lie through your teeth about it anyway, wouldn't you?<eos> Objection.<eos> Mr. Evans, isn't it true that you're a long-time drug dealer and your testimony today is only happening because you signed a deal with Ms. Gibbs giving you immunity?<eos> Doesn't mean I'm lying.<eos> Because you wouldn't lie just to get out of going to prison?<eos> No, I would not.<eos> Well, how about if the other reason was to get back at someone you've been jealous of your entire life?<eos> I've never been jealous of Mike Ross in my entire life.<eos> And I just caught you in a lie.
I'm sure you'll recognize this list.<eos> After all, you typed it up.<eos> And it looks like his name isn't on this one either.<eos> No, he wasn't on the list, but he was smart enough to talk to his way in, which is what a good lawyer does and exactly what I was looking for.<eos> How exactly did he talk his way in?<eos> Answer the question, Ms. Paulsen.<eos> He took someone else's spot.<eos> You mean he said he was someone else.<eos> You're under oath, Ms. Paulsen.<eos> May I remind you that perjury carries a sentence of up to five years?
But then I really got to know Mike when we were arguing over an ethics question in Professor Gerard's class.<eos> Should a lawyer who's crossed a line be given a second chance?<eos> I didn't think so, but Mike did, and that's when I realized that Mike Ross has more integrity and compassion in his little finger than any other lawyer I've ever met.<eos> And if I was on trial for my life, there's no one I'd rather have on my side than my fellow Harvard alum Mike Ross.<eos> Just so we're 100% clear, was Mike Ross a student at Harvard Law School with you?<eos> Yes, he was.<eos> No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Now we've heard enough. Ms. Gibbs, I'll give you 24 hours to prepare for cross.<eos> Oh, I don't need 24 hours, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Kirkwood, isn't it true that two days ago, Mr. Ross contacted you on the street outside of your office and the two of you got into a heated argument?
The only problem is, they're not gonna let me change my goddamn lawyer in the middle of a trial!<eos> And I'm telling you we need to figure out a way to make them.<eos> Because if we don't... We're gonna lose.<eos> You're not allowed to talk to me.<eos> That's true, but if you don't tell anyone, then no one's gonna know, and I don't think you're gonna want to tell anyone.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I have to admit that until you got rid of Sheila, I honestly thought you weren't part of this whole thing, but then I did a little checking, and I think I can pinpoint the exact day you found out about Mike Ross.<eos> I'm calling Jessica.<eos> They let you resign, you found out about Mike, and you used it to return as a name partner.
(HARVEY READING)<eos> CLIFFORD: I don't owe Harvey shit.<eos> He may have gotten me out, but he and Cameron put me there in the first place.<eos> You're right. You don't owe Harvey. But you do owe me.<eos> Because I didn't have anything to do with putting you in there, but I broke the law to get you out.
Clifford was shot and killed three weeks ago. So... I'm sorry, he can't help you.<eos> GRETCHEN:<eos> Hello? Are you in the office?<eos> It's Thursday night.<eos> Pm watching my show.<eos> LOUIS: Well, then, goddamn TiVo it because I need your help.<eos> It better be important if you're taking that tone with me.<eos> And if this is about that mah-jongg game...<eos> I don't give a shit if it's mah-jongg or kung pao or Chinese checkers.<eos> This is the most important thing that I'm ever going to ask you to do in your entire life.
And what exactly were they? JUDGE KNIGHT:<eos> Mr. Alexander?<eos> Objection, Your Honor.<eos> Ms. Gibbs, this case isn't under the Justice Department's jurisdiction, so what exactly are you objecting to?<eos> I'm objecting to the fact that this man is not a lawyer.<eos> Your Honor, that is a lie.<eos> And as we speak, a jury is finding him guilty.<eos> And until they do, my bar number is active.<eos> This is ridiculous, Your Honor.<eos> He's making a mockery of this entire courtroom. And I urge you to at least delay this case until his jury comes back.
He's making a mockery of this entire courtroom. And I urge you to at least delay this case until his jury comes back.<eos> Your Honor, the only reason I'm representing Mr. Diaz is because his court-appointed lawyer didn't show up.<eos> And then, that man attempted to railroad him into an outrageous plea deal.<eos> Ms. Gibbs, he may be a fraud in your court. But since he hasn't been convicted of anything, he isn't one in mine.<eos> And unless Mr. Alexander here magically finds his voice, Mr. Ross' motion to exclude the search of his client's vehicle passes.<eos> Is it true? What that woman was saying?<eos> Yes, they're deliberating on his fate right now.<eos> I don't give a shit if they're deliberating. ls he a fake or not?<eos> You saw what he just did.<eos> And he's about to cut you a deal from four years behind bars to maybe a few months.
Mike, where are you going?<eos> To go try and make a deal of my own.<eos> You ran out of there so fast, I didn't get a chance to talk to you.<eos> What exactly do you want, Mr. Ross?<eos> I want to make a deal.<eos> You're finally ready to turn on Mr. Specter?<eos> No. But I am ready to plead guilty and never practice law again. If you agree to not go after any of the partners at Pearson Specter.<eos> That's the same bullshit your boss said to me when I first met him.<eos> You're done practicing, so I should just let you get away with it?<eos> Now, why would I listen to you now if I didn't listen to him then?
Because you've got it written all over your face.<eos> Seeing me be a lawyer makes you sick.<eos> All right?<eos> And if I win, I'm going to keep being a lawyer, and it's going to make you sick for the rest of your life.<eos> No deal.<eos> That's not a good enough reason.<eos> Okay, then, let's try this one.<eos> You've been at the same level at the US Attorney's Office for a long time.<eos> Now, a person who can't get a conviction against a man that everyone thinks is a fraud, that's a person who's going nowhere.<eos> This is a chance for you to save face.
What do you mean, what do I have?<eos> Well, that's not good enough.<eos> Well, then, what the hell did you come to me for?<eos> Because I was expecting something more than the testimony of a man who's saving his own ass, which gets me nothing.<eos> Nothing?<eos> I'd be giving you my word.<eos> And I don't need your word, I need proof.<eos> Well, God damn it, I don't have any proof.<eos> Well, then, you're no good to me.<eos> And now, I'm in the position of having to work that much harder to get both you and your partners. So, if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to it, Louis.
I don't want to go to prison, Harvey.<eos> Then, get out of my way and let me do what I do.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I came to talk.<eos> I got to hand it to you, you would have made a good lawyer.<eos> You got in my head.<eos> You came here to take my offer?<eos> I came to make an offer of my own.<eos> You said you were giving me a chance to save face. But I let you get off with no punishment, as far as my career goes,<eos> I might as well have let them find you innocent.
I came to make an offer of my own.<eos> You said you were giving me a chance to save face. But I let you get off with no punishment, as far as my career goes,<eos> I might as well have let them find you innocent.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You plead guilty, do two years in prison, and I won't go after any of your friends.<eos> There's no way I agree to prison time for a crime I didn't commit.<eos> We're not in the courtroom right now, Mike. So, let's cut the bullshit.<eos> We both know you did this.<eos> So, if you don't want to pay, then you take me up on my original offer.<eos> You do no time, and all I need in return is one name partner at your firm.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but your cousin Gertrude's on the phone.<eos> She says she needs to know whether you found that old mixtape of hers.<eos> Tell her I didn't.<eos> Tell her it must have gotten thrown out and to never ask me about it again.<eos> Good.<eos> What do you mean, "Good"?<eos> I've been wanting to tell Anita Gibbs to go to hell since this whole thing started.<eos> Mr. Ross, I'd like to make your client an offer.<eos> We're listening.<eos> We don't want you, Mr. Diaz.
DIAZ:<eos> Holy shit. No jail time.<eos> ALEXANDER:<eos> No jail time. Okay, that's enough.<eos> I need a moment with my client.<eos> No, I don't need a moment. I'll take it.<eos> Mr. Diaz, listen to me.<eos> Testifying against your friends may not seem like a big deal right now, but it's something you are going to have to live with for the rest of your life.<eos> I don't owe them anything. And if I can get myself out, that's what I'm going to do.<eos> He's only offering you this because he doesn't have a case against you.
You know it, I know it, everybody in the goddamn room knew it.<eos> It was guilty.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> That woman didn't make her case, and I'm not letting my country's justice system go to shit on my watch.<eos> Say it.<eos> Not guilty.<eos> They told us you guys cut some kind of deal.<eos> Guess you should have had a little more faith in the system.<eos> Mr. Specter.<eos> Mrs. Danner, what can I do for you?
Let me guess, you're suing me for inducement.<eos> You bet your ass I am.<eos> You induced Jack Soloff into breaking his noncompete.<eos> You don't have a noncompete with Jack Soloff or anyone else.<eos> I heard you tried that empty threat with Louis, but it's not gonna work with me.<eos> If it is empty, then so is your morals clause and your bylaws, which states that if a named partner participates in a crime, any partner is free to go.<eos> And conspiracy to commit fraud is a goddamn crime.<eos> You can't prove we knew about Mike Ross.<eos> Well, let me suggest that you ask Louis Litt about his conversation with Katrina Bennett this morning.<eos> I got you, Jessica, and if you want to come after me for hiring Jack, or anyone for hiring anyone, you may not go to jail, but the world is gonna know what you did.
You know, I don't give a shit what he thought when he made that deal.<eos> He was gonna be found innocent.<eos> What?<eos> I went to see the foreman.<eos> The verdict was gonna be not guilty.<eos> Then let me see your deal with Gibbs.<eos> I don't have it yet.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> You're asking me to decimate my firm for a deal you don't even know she'll take?<eos> - I'll make her take the deal. - You don't know that.
This isn't about me not becoming a lawyer or him ruining my life or any of this other bullshit that you're in here saying.<eos> This is because he pulled one over on you.<eos> He can't be trusted!<eos> Dad, I'm sorry that I kept this from you, but he didn't keep it from me, and I'm telling you I can trust him.<eos> And how can I trust you?<eos> Well, if you can't, then maybe you shouldn't come to the wedding.<eos> Well, that about sums it up.<eos> It's not easy to resist the temptation to make a deal that saves yourself.<eos> Well, as far as I'm concerned, I did make a deal that saves myself.<eos> But I didn't just come here to make you proud.
Look, I promise it's not gonna be too much trouble.<eos> We're not gonna invite too many people.<eos> I'd be honored, Michael.<eos> Thank you, Father.<eos> Michael, since you're not inviting many people, we don't have to do it in here.<eos> We could always do it in the small chapel.<eos> I appreciate that, Father, but my mom and dad weren't married in the small chapel.<eos> Okay, you're here.<eos> What's so important I had to reschedule an arraignment to meet with you?<eos> Because that arraignment wasn't gonna lead to you putting corporate murderers behind bars.
Are you kidding me?<eos> You bent rules up and down this entire case.<eos> Except the difference between you and me is, I'm bending them to get justice.<eos> Putting these people away is justice.<eos> Then give them to me anyway.<eos> That's right.<eos> You've been keeping this case in your back pocket waiting for a rainy day, because that's what you do.<eos> So maybe the next time you have a chance to put away murderers, you'll do it instead of saving it up for a chit down the road.<eos> You hate me that much?<eos> I don't hate you, but you did this, and you can try to get out of it, but what you can't do anymore is deny you did it.
Chain link and barbwire mostly.<eos> It keeps the Zs out.<eos> But I'm not too sure about humans.<eos> We can scavenge the sheet metal off the shelters and build a more defensible barricade.<eos> Still time to make a run for it.<eos> They'd only catch us out in the open.<eos> At this point we stay and fight.<eos> Use home court advantage.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We wouldn't stand a chance without you.
It's just me.<eos> Hey, boss. Hey.<eos> Nice shot.<eos> That's all you.<eos> You deserve it.<eos> You deserve it.<eos> How's it going back there? It's going.<eos> You should probably get there.<eos> Find yourself a nice spot outside the perimeter.<eos> So we can set up a crossfire. What about you?
So we can set up a crossfire. What about you?<eos> I'll be along in a bit.<eos> I'm going to check around the perimeter to make sure<eos> The Man doesn't come back early.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> If you so much as move, I'll shoot you in the spine and leave you for the zombies. I said damn it I'll shoot!<eos> You know that's completely up to them, right?<eos> You just make sure you have the transport standing by and ready for x-fill.<eos> This will all be over soon.<eos> Except for you.
I need someone on that elevator, the conference room.<eos> Jackson, see what's down there.<eos> You two with me.<eos> Well, you're certainly setting the bar low for your replacement, Bethany.<eos> Not that I'm surprised.<eos> Did you call the OPR?<eos> No, she didn't, the director did.<eos> I was just about to give my orientation speech for the new OPR agents, a rare honor, but then I get a call saying this outfit's been compromised... again.<eos> Chief Inspector Jonas Fischer, Office of Professional Responsibility.<eos> - I know who you are.
Here's the deal... you start talking, or I send that to the Russian embassy.<eos> What do you wanna know?<eos> Agent Reade.<eos> With me, please.<eos> _<eos> Did you trust Ms. Doe initially, Edgar?<eos> No, but then she earned it.<eos> Sounds like Tom Carter didn't trust her, either.<eos> In fact, Agent Zapata told me that he approached her about informing on Jane.<eos> Did he approach you, too?
Is this about Jane's past or ours?<eos> Look... however you feel about her, you don't know who she is.<eos> I just don't wanna see you get hurt.<eos> Fischer's looking for you.<eos> So, you lied to me.<eos> I asked if you were in a romantic relationship with any of your co-workers, you said no.<eos> Your polygraph disagrees.<eos> - I didn't lie. - Mm.<eos> I sent agents to your home.<eos> Your sister was not particularly cooperative, but little Sawyer was very eager to tell us all about how he saw you and Auntie Taylor kissing outside your house.
No.<eos> So you can't confirm that she even went home.<eos> Hang on, what I'm telling you...<eos> I'm just trying to establish a timeline.<eos> Agent Patterson told me she saw Jane go home with her detail.<eos> You've just confirmed she subsequently met you later that night without her detail, after which she left, totally unaccounted for, on the last night Tom Carter was seen alive.<eos> The only person who knows where Jane really was that night is Jane.<eos> So, stop me if I'm getting any of this wrong.<eos> Tom Carter didn't trust you.<eos> He wanted you in his custody.

The truth is, you were kidnapped at the age of five.<eos> You were trafficked to Russia, you were taught the language.<eos> You were taught to lie, you were trained to fight.<eos> Do it again.<eos> And then sent back to the United States to infiltrate the FBI.<eos> Reade suspected it.<eos> But Carter proved it.<eos> And he and Agent Patterson's boyfriend were murdered because of it.<eos> You actually spoke Russian to a fellow Russian spy in this very room.<eos> Olivia Delidio recognized you.

Jane is not the mole.<eos> Then why did Roman ID her?<eos> You're a Russian counterintelligence agent.<eos> You've had years to bust this spy ring.<eos> You didn't, why?<eos> You're protecting them.<eos> Roman's your guy.<eos> He ID'd Jane because you told him to.<eos> I have been here all day trying to help you.<eos> We didn't call you in here today.
- What do they sell? - Coffee.<eos> What kind?<eos> The black, sludgy stuff with the... the grinds.<eos> Someone get me a Turkish coffee.<eos> Fischer's orientation for the new OPR agents. Where was it?<eos> Newark, 8:00 a.m.<eos> I was just about to give my orientation speech for the new OPR agents.<eos> Then I get a call.<eos> Olivia was found dead 8:06 a.m.<eos> What time did the director call you?
He'll try to silence her before anyone can prove it.<eos> You know, our OPR detention facilities are actually quite comfortable.<eos> But I don't think you'll be here for long.<eos> You have the wrong person, I'm innocent.<eos> Innocent people have alibis.<eos> So where were you the night Carter was killed?<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> It only means whatever you were up to till 4:00 a.m. that morning must've been worse.<eos> I collected my evidence against you in a matter of hours.

Is it the cash for the car?<eos> Leave it at the office and call the librarian.<eos> Learn the poem by heart for next time.<eos> Goodbye, sir.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> - Can I speak to you, sir?<eos> I was very upset the other day.<eos> What day?<eos> The day that woman accused you in the taxi.
- Shalom.<eos> I'm your upstairs neighbor.<eos> We've just moved in.<eos> Could you let me in?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Rana?<eos> Rana.<eos> Rana, what happened to you?<eos> Please go out, sir.<eos> - Wait outside, we'll call you for the scanner.
Could you let me in?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Rana?<eos> Rana.<eos> Rana, what happened to you?<eos> Please go out, sir.<eos> - Wait outside, we'll call you for the scanner.<eos> - Rana... Please stay outside.<eos> - Look at me.<eos> - No worries. We'll call you.
Sorry.<eos> I'm sorry for the trouble last night.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> Call the police. They'll find him, thanks to the pickup.<eos> I will.<eos> I'll find a place to park, in the meantime.<eos> We thought we'd got rid of her.<eos> Do you know who the pickup owner is?<eos> The woman had too many visitors.<eos> I may ask you to testify, if a detective comes.
Put them in the trash.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because.<eos> - Your phone.<eos> - I don't have one.<eos> - Give it to me.<eos> - I don't have one.<eos> Hold on, sir.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> - I didn't film you.
I'm talking to him.<eos> I deleted it.<eos> Please.<eos> Call your father to come and see your photos.<eos> His father's dead, sir.<eos> Hello, Daddy.<eos> Did you buy me a surprise egg?<eos> Sorry, couldn't find the key.<eos> No problem.<eos> To keep from bothering you each time, you could leave it next to the boiler.
And there'll be nobody home.<eos> We're free and clear.<eos> We're free at last.<eos> Lock the door and take the key.<eos> Get up.<eos> Up.<eos> Wait.<eos> Sit here.<eos> Go into the bedroom.<eos> You see how upset you've made her?
You okay, Daddy?<eos> You look okay.<eos> You gave us quite a scare.<eos> Where's Mom?<eos> - Coming.<eos> - Majid, tell her not to come up.<eos> We're going soon.<eos> Majid, let her come up. It'll reassure her to see him.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Sorry, in all the panic we didn't greet you...
Yes... or maybe she's just a bitch.<eos> Either way, you can't be friends with her right now.<eos> Sometimes, it's best to just give people some space.<eos> Hello.<eos> Welcome to the Super Emporium.<eos> Hello.<eos> Welcome to the Super Emporium.<eos> - Enjoy your shopping experience. - Thank you. - Hello.<eos> Welcome to the Super Emporium. - Hello. Hi.<eos> I'm Suzanne, and let me know if you need anything.
I work for an off-book wing of the NSA called Zero Division.<eos> About six years ago, I started to connect a number of seemingly random terror events.<eos> The Kentucky State Building attack, DC subway bombing, shooting at O'Hare.<eos> Those were all lone wolves.<eos> No, they were just designed to look like that.<eos> We believe that a single group is responsible for over a dozen domestic terror attacks in total.<eos> I've given them the code name "Sandstorm."<eos> We cultivated an asset within the organization, and they managed to get word to us alluding to an impending incident in Times Square.<eos> We believe that Jane was a key member of Sandstorm sent to you as a Trojan horse, and we've been monitoring the situation ever since.<eos> The only reason we're telling you now is because we need your help to get to Jane before the CIA does.
Then why do we use a polygraph?<eos> Because... we're not allowed to inject our subjects with substantial doses of radioactive material.<eos> It's not exactly legal.<eos> Hello, Jane.<eos> My name is Naz.<eos> I need you to be completely honest with me.<eos> That's the only way that this is going to work.<eos> What makes you think I'll tell you anything?<eos> You managed to escape, unaided, from a CIA black site in Oregon two weeks ago.<eos> I think it's fair to categorize you as resourceful.

The MRI...<eos> Of course she is now!<eos> She's been caught.<eos> She's hooked up to that machine.<eos> It doesn't mean we can trust her.<eos> Look...<eos> They made a mistake... when they killed Mayfair in front of her.<eos> She wants to bring them down, and... she's already killed her fiancé.<eos> She loved Mayfair.<eos> And she loved you.
I thought I was... protecting you... all of you... by doing what they wanted.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> But the people who did this to us are still out there.<eos> And they need to be stopped.<eos> So let's make this right.<eos> Mayfair is dead, Jane.<eos> There's no making this right.<eos> Then let's make them pay.<eos> Jane's got a fake business number she calls to set up a meet... "Joey's Pizza."<eos> We're gonna drive you out of the city and have you place the call from a payphone.
Dance with me.<eos> We ain't got no music.<eos> Nobody's fact-checking that.<eos> True.<eos> You know, this feels like... the most normal thing I've done in a while.<eos> You okay?<eos> Suzanne's in rough shape, man.<eos> I heard.<eos> It's like we're in a horror movie.<eos> The kind you'd watch at sleepovers when you were a kid... and then you'd have to run to your mom at the end... hug you, tell you it was all made up.
An inmate is in medical because of a fight you instigated.<eos> An inmate's in medical because an ape had a tantrum.<eos> You are suspended for a month, without pay.<eos> Get the fuck out of my sight!<eos> No one is suspended.<eos> That is not your call to make, Captain.<eos> And you are lucky you still have that title, after the shit you pulled last night.<eos> You suspend him, I pull my entire staff.<eos> We walk.<eos> How'd that work out for you last time?
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> You saw what they did to me.<eos> Shit, forget about me, what about you?<eos> The Bureau will need a full review of your hiring practices.<eos> That's necessary?<eos> The deceased officer had four different social security numbers attributed to his name...<eos> We have no idea who this guy really was.<eos> What a nightmare, huh?<eos> For you?
Sam, what's wrong?<eos> Red... when did you get here?<eos> Look at me.<eos> I don't know what's going on with you, but you need to get yourself together.<eos> You hear me?<eos> This is no time to feel sorry for yourself.<eos> Go home, take a shower, and get back here.<eos> You have a home, so it can't be that bad.<eos> You don't get to have a crisis right now.<eos> We need you, understand?
No vitals.<eos> That's what I wrote down.<eos> I'm also supposed to assess injury, but I'm not exactly sure how to approach that.<eos> That's why, uh, Foster is here from Max.<eos> Oh, Captain Piscatella also told us to get Bayley some diazepam from the med closet.<eos> Should we still go do that?<eos> Bayley's still here?<eos> -What is it?<eos> -Just take it, son.<eos> Officer Dixon's gonna drive you home.
Who?<eos> Her friends.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> I don't even know what I did. I...<eos> I didn't even know--<eos> You can't.<eos> You cannot go into C-Dorm.<eos> They're grieving.<eos> They're not ready to hear you.
Asthma attack?<eos> A violent outburst?<eos> Something?<eos> There was no condition and it wasn't motivated.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Better yet... we'll handle it.<eos> Hey!<eos> This is my fucking prison.<eos> And you should go run it.<eos> We'll call you when we're ready and we'll go over everything.
Then we will get the police over here, pronto.<eos> Phones are still cut off, right?<eos> No one's coming in?<eos> Everyone's locked down?<eos> The phones are off.<eos> And I canceled visitation, but I lifted the lockdown.<eos> These women shouldn't have to sit trapped in their bunks.<eos> Okay. Hey!<eos> Nothing happens without my approval. You hear me?<eos> We'll make sure you're comfortable with everything.
What the hell is this?<eos> A charmstone.<eos> - Zimmermann's desk. - Mate!<eos> You're losing it! - A Miss Sommerfeld.<eos> - Don't know her. Thought not.<eos> - Don't hang up!<eos> I'll see if I can put you through.<eos> Who is she?<eos> - Clara. - The Clara?<eos> One moment, Miss Sommerfeld, I'll put you through.
Wortmann wants to see you.<eos> Look. Here it is.<eos> Hello? !<eos> You prefer the papers? Or will you take a look?<eos> He's written an article about you. - What?<eos> Have you taken leave of your senses?<eos> Do you really think I'll stick my neck out for your sake?<eos> You're putting our reputation at stake.<eos> It's the most outrageous behaviour I've ever encountered.<eos> They have to think I'm giving you hell or they'll all write what they want.

But love...
Hello?<eos> Hello!<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Please, stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> I have to get you to a hospital!
Fugitive warrants don't expire ever.<eos> Until he comes back to stand trial, he will be considered a wanted criminal.<eos> Listen, did it ever occur to you that we are missing our son? We've lost our son. We don't know if he's alive.<eos> Please try to find a little compassion.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Wolf.<eos> I can see you're a close family, which is probably why I think you will hear from Goodman soon, if you haven't already.<eos> But just bear in mind that when you do, you are legally required to contact us.<eos> And if you don't, you will go to jail.<eos> God, they're like the Gestapo.<eos> Instead of barging into your home and intimidating you, they should be out there trying to find Goodman.
Do you?<eos> I don't.<eos> I think it's sad.<eos> You want to be actors?<eos> Why?<eos> To become stars?<eos> Or to hold a mirror up to nature, to show what it means to be human?<eos> That's what this exercise is about:<eos> to be willing to be brave enough to be private in public, to risk revealing your own humanity.<eos> The audience pays you to show them who they really are inside because they're too busy or they're too frightened to look.
You're begging.<eos> You, Ms. Jacobson, are a beggar.<eos> You don't want to be seen. You just want to be liked.<eos> You're an approval junkie.<eos> To me, that is sad.<eos> You're an approval junkie.<eos> You care too much what others think of you.<eos> We know this. It's what you think that matters.<eos> You need to find your voice and listen to it.<eos> I'm leaving you.
It's like the booby prize.<eos> I disagree, Shauna.<eos> I have seen tangible behavioral improvement in you.<eos> You've been so much more confident and more optimistic.<eos> I'm taking Prozac.<eos> My doctor prescribed it for me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I wish you'd told me.<eos> You obviously feel it's helping?<eos> Well, if I wasn't taking it, I don't think I'd have the courage to leave you.
We do things all the time for the family That actually cost money.<eos> We don't charge you guys for any of it. This is different.<eos> You're different.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> I helped dad paint the house, and I didn't charge him for that.<eos> Yes, you did, you charged him $600. Well, I didn't know that you knew that.<eos> That kind of weakens my argument.<eos> Another amazing meal, Heather.<eos> Oh, thanks, Dad.<eos> For you, sir.
I got hungry.<eos> And heat that soup up on the stove.<eos> Not the microwave.<eos> - It makes it taste different.<eos> Margaret called.<eos> Too busy to talk to her own mother more than once a week, and then when she does call, she won't stop harping on the nursing home.<eos> You can't call a structure covered in spray-on stucco "golden" anything.<eos> I'm speaking to you.<eos> Please don't stand there like a half-wit.<eos> She worries about you.
I was a little wild when I was younger.<eos> Went to jail for a while.<eos> What for?<eos> Armed robbery.<eos> We hit up a jewelry store.<eos> A jewel thief?<eos> Oh, so you were a bad boy.<eos> I can't understand what you're saying.<eos> It's rude.<eos> Let's get you in the car, okay?
I saw the way he looked at you.<eos> Dirty!<eos> You get involved with a person like that and you'll regret it, sooner rather than later.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Now, I- - I have to go to the little girls' room.<eos> That was his job.<eos> That's how he earns a living.<eos> He's a person.<eos> And I'm a person.<eos> I don't just live to work for you.
I am pleasantly surprised.<eos> Yeah, I, uh...<eos> I took the liberty of looking through them for that crazy photo, but, uh, they're clean.<eos> Well, not clean.<eos> There's some gnarly snaps, but, uh, not the one we're looking for.<eos> So, I guess some things will always be a mystery.<eos> Hey, what's your background, CO Luschek?<eos> Uh... mostly Scottish.<eos> Some French fur traders, way back.<eos> No, I mean, how did you end up here?
Now take the missing numbers, bunch of gobbledygook, until you take up these dots and arrows from underneath the numbers...<eos> - Latitude and longitude.<eos> - Exactly. The Dark Isles, a chain of uninhabited islands in the Black Sea.<eos> - What's there?<eos> - Behinds a dead platinum mine, nothing.<eos> Can NRO give us some more recent satellite images?<eos> You're looking at it.<eos> Apparently, it's not exactly a high priority.<eos> I've expedited clearance through the State Department to investigate.<eos> An FBI attaché will meet you in Ankara, Turkey, and escort you to the island.

A good agent who got her boyfriend killed.<eos> Well, if Agent Patterson's available, I'd like to get started.<eos> Let me talk to her first.<eos> No.<eos> That's not how this works.<eos> How did you know of this place?<eos> Brave FBI man, huh?<eos> How do you know of this place?<eos> You don't answer, they pay.<eos> I'm gonna kill you.
Do you speak English?<eos> I do.<eos> My name is Kurt Weller.<eos> I'm Special Agent with the FBI.<eos> This is my team.<eos> I'm Sergeant Mike Simms, NYPD.<eos> How did you know we were here?<eos> We didn't.<eos> We're investigating some suspicious activity on the island.<eos> - And they captured you.
- I'll go too.<eos> - Mike...<eos> I know the layout of the island, their patterns.<eos> I can help.<eos> Tasha, make sure that satphone's ready to go the second we get back with the battery.<eos> On it.<eos> Let me go with you.<eos> These people are gonna need you if we don't make it back.<eos> Make it back.<eos> Can I ask you something?
I will never forgive myself for what happened.<eos> Ugh.<eos> Please just...<eos> If I'm gonna be able to keep going,<eos> I need to find the people who did this, the people who tattooed Jane.<eos> Please.<eos> This job is all that I have.<eos> No.<eos> It's all you had.<eos> I need you in the lab.
Speaking up about Paloma Diaz almost cost me everything.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Just after I came forward, my boss at ICE, Scott Stern, slapped me with a bogus sexual harassment charge, then he said he'd fired me if I testified.<eos> - Who would hire me after that?<eos> - So, you backed down?<eos> I have a family.<eos> I need this job.<eos> I didn't know what would happen to that kid.<eos> If you tell us what you know, we can protect you from Stern.<eos> He won't be able to threaten you anymore.
- She got on the right bus.<eos> I checked the security tapes.<eos> She just never made it to the border.<eos> So, where did they take her?<eos> And why did Stern want to cover it up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I stopped asking when they threatened to destroy my life.<eos> They thought it was me, that I was the mole.<eos> From what I understand, it was quite the opposite.<eos> Wasn't Agent Weller the one who exonerated you?
- I know that.<eos> - No. You don't understand.<eos> Then explain it to me.<eos> I know how freeing it must seem to walk away from all of this, but running from your problems doesn't fix them.<eos> No, it might fix this.<eos> What is it that you're not telling me?<eos> You're hiding something.<eos> You have been for weeks.<eos> I can't help you if you won't tell me the truth.<eos> I'm not asking you to help me.
Anyone besides me even read her file?<eos> Does this even look like the same girl to you?<eos> Who are you?<eos> You with the feds?<eos> She's been here for an hour already.<eos> Whoever she's working with won't be far behind.<eos> Gentlemen!<eos> My apologies, but we're gonna have to cut this night short.<eos> But rest assured, I will make it up to each and every one of you in spades.<eos> Sir, we have to get you out of here now.
That's not to follow me, it's to follow them.<eos> You install it in the vehicle's ECU, behind the glove box and next to the fuse board.<eos> It looks just like the chip you'll be replacing.<eos> Okay, listen, I...<eos> I know what I said last night may have...<eos> - eroded some trust between us.<eos> - No. I never trusted you.<eos> How's your head?<eos> Stop looking into Tom Carter's disappearance... or people you love will start to die.<eos> Or I could just kill you now with your own gun.

It is not your call.<eos> You're right.<eos> How did you trace the team to the power plant?<eos> I didn't...<eos> I tracked the assassin from ZOMO's studio back to the ship.<eos> I was surveilling him, trying to figure out what he was up to, when the team showed up.<eos> Why didn't you alert us to your presence?<eos> I couldn't without alerting him to yours.<eos> And then when you guys didn't come out, I waited for the right moment and I went in after you.<eos> Do something like that again, and you're done.
Instead of trying to bury yourself in your work and forget about David, why don't you take the night to celebrate him?<eos> Go to that restaurant, have a glass of wine, toast David and all the wonderful memories you had with him.<eos> I don't know.<eos> That just seems...<eos> I mean, he's gone.<eos> I'm supposed to move on, right?<eos> I mean, that's... the healthy thing to do?<eos> Well, like I've said, there's no right or wrong way to grieve.<eos> Sometimes allowing yourself to indulge in memories of a loved one is the best way to get closure.<eos> Should I be paying you for this or...
- Got him?<eos> - On him.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Who stole the chemical weapons?<eos> - Uhh!<eos> South Koreans had a liaison.<eos> Vanessa Chang.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Stand up!<eos> She double-crossed you?
- Seriously?<eos> - Oh, right.<eos> Of course, you don't know because I'm imagining you.<eos> Something sweet?<eos> Oh, I didn't order it.<eos> Oh.<eos> Uh... sorry.<eos> This sheep, do you have this on all of your desserts?<eos> No, Miss.<eos> It's especially for you.
That is not the word I'd use.<eos> Ah, I am a little short on cash.<eos> Um, what does this get me?<eos> Oh, what?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm just looking out for my partner.<eos> We're not partners.<eos> No?<eos> The deal's off?<eos> Oh, well, I guess I should just put the bracelets on you, call it a night.
She was in the prison when Guerrero got shanked!<eos> A federal prosecutor should know the difference between correlation and causation.<eos> After Guerrero is killed, Carter suddenly disappears, his car abandoned by a bridge.<eos> Everybody hated Carter, not just Mayfair.<eos> Huh, well, that doesn't explain Sofia Varma.<eos> She and Mayfair were lovers until, you guessed it, she commits suicide, her car abandoned by a bridge.<eos> Sound familiar?<eos> Everybody Mayfair gets close to winds up dead.<eos> And if you're as smart as you seem, I know you've had suspicions about her.<eos> I have suspicions about you.
I'm just sitting down for tea.<eos> - Do you want some?<eos> - Oh, uh, yes. Thank you.<eos> I could, uh, really use some caffeine.<eos> - Mark Waterman.<eos> You don't get to make the threats.<eos> _<eos> So... yes, I know... it seems crazy, but I think this whole treasure hunt he made for me ends here.<eos> Um, I think it's something about Taurus or constellations or something I'm supposed to find.<eos> So someone coded messages all over this city sending you to my shop?
Um, I think it's something about Taurus or constellations or something I'm supposed to find.<eos> So someone coded messages all over this city sending you to my shop?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ah... see, it's crazy.<eos> I mean...<eos> I do have a rather large astrological collection.<eos> Some very rare pieces.<eos> - You do? - Yeah.<eos> Just here in the back.<eos> Let me get them for you.
Mark?<eos> I know why they sent you.<eos> No, no.<eos> No one's sent me.<eos> I...<eos> I'm... I'm not here in any official way.<eos> I know they've been watching me.<eos> No.<eos> Please.<eos> The FBI is not watching you.
They told me they'd kill Sarah if I didn't delete the D.O.T. files.<eos> I don't understand it.<eos> The footage is a dead end.<eos> It's impossible to I.D. this guy.<eos> - Then why the threats?<eos> - That's not your concern anymore.<eos> They've got to have a guy on the inside at the D.O.T.<eos> No more theories.<eos> You're off this.<eos> I'm putting a detail on you and Sarah.
If you can't get to safety, shelter in place.<eos> Wait for instructions from authorities.<eos> Stay down.<eos> - Help me.<eos> - Just stay down.<eos> Drop your weapon!<eos> Show me your hands!<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> I need help.<eos> I gotta get you out of here.
Show me your hands!<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> I need help.<eos> I gotta get you out of here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ohh, son of a bitch!<eos> Do you know who the shooter is?<eos> No.<eos> But he came straight for me.<eos> - He was targeting you?
I need help.<eos> I gotta get you out of here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ohh, son of a bitch!<eos> Do you know who the shooter is?<eos> No.<eos> But he came straight for me.<eos> - He was targeting you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> We have to get you out front.
Get your hands up!<eos> My hands are already up.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Do it, now!<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> - My team...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Don't shoot me, please.<eos> I'm not going to shoot you.
Go, move.<eos> If you can get to safety, go.<eos> Go, keep going!<eos> I'll go this way.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, FBI, get out of here!<eos> Come on.<eos> Go. Move! Get out of here.<eos> You okay?<eos> All right, I'm gonna get you to safety.
Get up.<eos> - Slowly.<eos> - All right.<eos> Hey, you Levi Hart?<eos> - Man, I played ball too.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> I want Coach Jones.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I saw you talking to him.
Hey, you Levi Hart?<eos> - Man, I played ball too.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> I want Coach Jones.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I saw you talking to him.<eos> Okay, okay, okay! Calm down, calm down.<eos> Listen, I was right with him right before all this happened.<eos> I'll take you to him.
- Shut up!<eos> I want Coach Jones.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I saw you talking to him.<eos> Okay, okay, okay! Calm down, calm down.<eos> Listen, I was right with him right before all this happened.<eos> I'll take you to him.<eos> If you're lying, I will put a bullet in your head.<eos> Understood, I'll take you to him.
Give us your location.<eos> Levi, killing Jones won't solve anything man.<eos> Whatever trouble you were in before...<eos> This ain't about none of that.<eos> Well, talk to me. Let me help you, man.<eos> Quit stalling.<eos> Tell me where Jones is... now.<eos> All right, he's on the west side of the building, where I left him barricaded.<eos> What room?<eos> I don't remember, but if you get me to the field house I can take you to him.
My life is in your hands, so it matters to me.<eos> So what happened, your coach is on you, riding you hard?<eos> - At Michigan, my coach...<eos> - This ain't about football.<eos> Jones ruined my life.<eos> How?<eos> What did he do?<eos> At first, I thought maybe it was just Tim and me.<eos> But... that camp he runs... it's just... a way to get close to kids. He's sick. Okay, tell me what happened.<eos> He ever give you a lift home?

It didn't have to end this way.<eos> I'm sorry, buddy.<eos> You did everything you could to get him out of here alive.<eos> Reade...<eos> Jones.<eos> All the bloodshed, everyone who died, all the families that lost someone... is because of you.<eos> Is it true? What are you talking about?<eos> You know what I'm talking about!<eos> If what those two boys said is really true,<eos> I'll find out, I'll find you, and I'll put you away myself.
You're not taking her alone.<eos> One of my team will go with you.<eos> She trusts us.<eos> You.<eos> You were after Maya all along.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> She drew your hand.<eos> Maya only draws things that she's seen before.<eos> You never crossed paths with her when she was in FBI custody, so she must have seen you somewhere before.<eos> What does she know about you that you don't want coming out?
I need NSA, DOE, and FEMA.<eos> Today is not the day a nuclear bomb goes off in New York City.<eos> Amin, escort Agent Booth to holding, please.<eos> What? You're throwing me in there with Caleb?<eos> I just got done telling you Alex is trying to frame me.<eos> And the bomb is in your truck, and the plans are on your computer.<eos> Until I know what the hell is going on, you are a person of interest in this investigation.<eos> Amin, do it.<eos> In one week, your training will be complete.<eos> It may have taken almost 140 days, but we have broken you down and built you back up.
The terrorist replaced them.<eos> We're running a check on the others now, but here's the thing...<eos> When we approach the truck, we have to make sure it's the right one, because if it's not, Perales could find out and it could push him over the edge.<eos> I agree.<eos> We have to keep this operation quiet.<eos> If anyone finds out about this, there will be so much chaos, we'll never stand a chance.<eos> People will panic, and people will get hurt.<eos> through Manhattan, and we've - just received word... - Miranda.<eos> Look. That video has leaked of Alex Parrish, seen here, in the garage of the FBI's New York field office with what appears to be a bomb of some kind.<eos> We'll keep you updated on the nature of the bomb, as well...
'Cause that's exactly what I came to speak to Ryan about.<eos> She stole an immunity agreement from my 9/11 case.<eos> Before you recriminate against Wyatt, you need...<eos> Liam, listen to me!<eos> Shelby's about to cross a line.<eos> She's gonna make a mistake that she'll regret for the rest of her life, and I know...<eos> I know you know how that feels.<eos> Please.<eos> Caleb, what are you doing here?<eos> I've got about 5 million different reasons to ask you the same thing.
Please.<eos> Caleb, what are you doing here?<eos> I've got about 5 million different reasons to ask you the same thing.<eos> Well, did Shelby send you? Where is she?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> You were supposed to take the money and stay away, but for some reason... God knows why... you can't.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> Shelby's on her way here, and I promised myself I would tell her everything and we'd finally get this all sorted out.<eos> You're not gonna get a chance to do that because that whole immunity deal,<eos> That's just a trap to get you onto American soil so you can be prosecuted for...
But if there's one lesson I can teach you, it's that each of you knows in your heart what is right...<eos> Kouri's recruitment plans have changed.<eos> It won't be tomorrow.<eos> Intel says next week.<eos> We'll be ready.<eos> what is fair, and what is just.<eos> Chang.<eos> You got your security clearance.<eos> Senator Haas signed it herself.<eos> No matter how surrounded you are by lies, don't let them in.

_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> He's at my bar, The Catacombs?<eos> - In Georgetown?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Happy New Year!<eos> Hey. Come on.<eos> I'll take you back.
And here I thought you didn't want me to make it to this day.<eos> I didn't.<eos> But I'm glad you did.<eos> I have plans for you, Alex Parrish.<eos> Dad, is that you?<eos> Who are...? Hi.<eos> Wait, you're...<eos> I'm Alex Parrish. I'm from the FBI.<eos> Yeah, no, I know who you are. You're everywhere.<eos> Plus my dad talks about you a lot.
Yes, I know. He talks about you, too, but I-I thought you were...<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Uh, my dad's still in D.C., isn't he?<eos> He told me my boyfriend and I could stay here this week.<eos> I thought he was in New York today.<eos> No. No, I just spoke to him like an hour ago.<eos> I must have been mistaken.<eos> Um, good to see you.
You framed people. You killed people!<eos> I had no choice! Okay!<eos> Calm down, Liam.<eos> You have to admit... it was kind of poetic, Alex, making you the fall guy.<eos> You never paid a price for killing your father, but here was your chance... penance for your sin, bringing about the change<eos> Michael himself would have wanted.<eos> He would have never wanted this.<eos> I wanted to get you kicked out.<eos> That way I could say that you turned vengeful, disgruntled, but you just wouldn't quit.<eos> And, Ryan, it wouldn't have ended like this for you if you had just come with me to D.C.
What?<eos> That trip we were gonna take after your graduation.<eos> What about it?<eos> Well, it turns out that I have some leave days saved up.<eos> How many?<eos> Let me think. One... carry the... 110.<eos> Hop in.<eos> This won't take long.<eos> Alexandra Parrish, my name is Matthew Keyes.<eos> It is my belief, as it is many others who work for me, that the FBI treated you terribly.

Well, not quite equal.<eos> I'll rise fast.<eos> All right, two weeks, and you might need more than one dinner.<eos> There's still a lot you don't know.<eos> Panic attacks, insecurity, insubordination, exasperation, crippling self-doubt...<eos> These are all symptoms trainees have experienced on their first day of work at their new field office.<eos> So, here at the Academy, we're trying something different.<eos> We're gonna give you a chance to visit a field office before you graduate.<eos> You'll shadow real agents working real cases.<eos> And as these agents don't know you personally, they will be evaluating you... specifically your readiness to work.

We move out in 20.<eos> I may not be able to prove what you did to Will, but are you why Shelby is changing her field office assignment request to Buffalo?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Okay, I don't believe all that "I just want to be closer to my family" thing.<eos> I think it's you.<eos> T-That's a huge mistake.<eos> You got to stop her.<eos> How about I stop you instead?<eos> I don't care who your family is, but you're done.<eos> I spoke with my supervisor, and we're going to test you today.
How about I stop you instead?<eos> I don't care who your family is, but you're done.<eos> I spoke with my supervisor, and we're going to test you today.<eos> Let me guess... You want us to play one person and swap back and forth?<eos> Yes, but that's not the hard part.<eos> We've already told an agent in the office that you will be posing as one trainee.<eos> This agent knows who you are, but you don't know who they are.<eos> The test is simple...<eos> Identify your contact without blowing your cover.<eos> Just like in the field, they can't walk up to you and say, "Nice to meet you.

You have to figure out who they are by looking for cues and arranging to meet without being found out.<eos> We'll do our best, but...<eos> what if we fail? If you fail, I won't even be able to send you to Poughkeepsie.
Agent Kent, um, I think I may have found a lead... a Scott Walker, 961 Lincoln Road, says he saw something the night of the break-in.<eos> Let's go pay him a visit.<eos> So I've got good news and bad news.<eos> Which do you want first?<eos> You pick.<eos> Well, I just finished a huge case yesterday, so I've nothing for you to do.<eos> What's the good news?<eos> I thought you'd think that was the good news.<eos> Then, what's the bad news?<eos> I can't have you do nothing, so unless you want to scan old crime-scene photos into the database, we're going to have to make something up.
So, that's why you only made eye contact half the time.<eos> You know, I heard a rumor Shaw was training twins.<eos> Training them badly, it turns out.<eos> You give up your cover that easy for a date? It's nothing.<eos> Please.<eos> You know, who is your handler, Amin?<eos> Coombs... Susan Coombs.<eos> Well, she doesn't like failure.<eos> And I don't like being made a fool of.<eos> I liked you, too.
-Fine.<eos> Jemma Moore on the line, sir.<eos> When the next Shaw leaks drops in two days time, you're buying.<eos> Ma'am, I apologize. I will leave you two be.<eos> What's this about Thomas Shaw?<eos> Peter can explain everything.<eos> -Bueno. You look like you could use the company.<eos> Matthew.<eos> Katherine.<eos> What brings you to Panama, Matthew?
Apparently, you learned German the right way.<eos> You grew up here?<eos> Yeah, my father was stationed at Andrews Barracks until '84.<eos> Military intelligence.<eos> That gives a boy something to live up to, no?<eos> So they say.<eos> Mom taking me to the park to play soccer.<eos> How old were you when she died?<eos> 8.<eos> Well, headquarters must have a rather cruel sense of irony sending you back here just for a promotion.
How old were you when she died?<eos> 8.<eos> Well, headquarters must have a rather cruel sense of irony sending you back here just for a promotion.<eos> I don't think headquarters knows what irony is.<eos> Well, you are very lucky to be inheriting Gerald's agents.<eos> He spent a long time recruiting them.<eos> Valerie Edwards.<eos> Hang on.<eos> -Just --<eos> When he's done shaking hands with the Germans, I will introduce you to Steven Frost.
He wants me to show him how important he is.<eos> An officer in the Saudi General Intelligence Directorate?<eos> Fuck right, he's important.<eos> Faisal's giving me an ultimatum.<eos> He's giving us an ultimatum.<eos> Okay, so, obviously that's not an option, so buy him a boyfriend.<eos> This is fucking Berlin.<eos> He's not out cruising, Robert.<eos> He's in love with me.<eos> He's in love with you?
Hans didn't so much as say it, but I know he wants us to drop the ax on someone.<eos> It's like a-a token accountability gesture to make amends.<eos> We were helping out at a fucking refugee center.<eos> Does that not count for anything?<eos> So what you're saying is, is you want to fire somebody at the bottom who bore absolutely no responsibility whatsoever?<eos> That's the answer?<eos> Well, what do you suggest?<eos> Steven resigns? You want me to quit?<eos> Oh, no, not you, Robert.<eos> Never. What would we ever do without you?
"Stop all deliveries."<eos> Friederike?<eos> Oh, no. Damn!<eos> I was hoping it was you.<eos> Blind date.<eos> I hope it's not her.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I just got stood up.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can I...buy you a drink?
I'm dead already, Holliday.<eos> - Have we met?<eos> - There isn't much time.<eos> You know Constance Clootie, someone called the Stone Witch?<eos> I am familiar with her work.<eos> Waverly Earp has something she desires.<eos> The skull.<eos> If she unites what was scattered, she will let the revenants of Wyatt Earp loose and set them free of the Ghost River Triangle.<eos> She will kill the girl. Come the Witching Hour, Constance will be<eos> - upon you.
Come, we wish to see it.<eos> There is no tomb.<eos> Now get out of my bloody dig.<eos> Please, sir.<eos> Please, come.<eos> - Just a quick look.<eos> - Move away.<eos> Monsieur!<eos> Come on, Selim.<eos> What on Earth possessed you to strike him?
Because an Arab workman is not a French duke.<eos> He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Maspero, and you know it.<eos> We're trying to do serious work.<eos> We're not a sideshow for tourists.<eos> Your work relies on the delicate balance of good will, which I must maintain.<eos> Here you have French bureaucracy against British foreign interest against Egyptian home rule.<eos> The country is a powder barrel and you sit above it, flicking matches at whomsoever displeases you.<eos> I don't care cos I'm not a bloody diplomat.<eos> I would never have said you were.<eos> May I remind you that neither of us will ever discover anything more important or wonderful than what is in that desert?
Thank you.<eos> Take those for the library.<eos> Take two trays.<eos> Carter.<eos> My dear fellow.<eos> Long time no see.<eos> Where have you been hiding yourself?<eos> Here and there.<eos> I've been doing some research.<eos> What can I do for you? Well...
This is his son.<eos> What's a cup with his name on doing in our dig?<eos> Well, your guess is as good as mine.<eos> Amarna was his capital.<eos> Petrie did some work there, actually.<eos> The thing is... that's 300 miles away.<eos> So how did Tutankhamun's cup get here?<eos> Now, Evelyn, this is Mr Carter.<eos> Carter, this is my daughter Evelyn.<eos> - Nice to meet you, Evelyn.
Papa says all the tombs were robbed.<eos> - Was this tomb robbed?<eos> - Yes, it was.<eos> That's such a shame.<eos> I wish you could find a royal tomb.<eos> So do I.<eos> Papa says perhaps they have all been found.<eos> Well, that's what everyone says.<eos> But you don't believe it, do you?<eos> - What makes you say that?
I thought you brought supplies.<eos> - Hot in there, was it?<eos> - I don't mind the heat, used to it.<eos> It's the bloody bat shit I take issue with.<eos> Gets in your sinuses and food doesn't taste right afterwards.<eos> Hand me those sardines, would you?<eos> - Here you are.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> That is better.<eos> Now... what can I do for you, my boy?

- A couple of feet.<eos> - It's essentially a scouting...<eos> - Papa. So we don't need...<eos> Evelyn, go and wait in the car.<eos> But, Papa... Go on now.<eos> Attention!<eos> - Lord Carnarvon.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm sorry to trouble you, sir.<eos> - I'm here to take you to the port.
Attention!<eos> - Lord Carnarvon.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm sorry to trouble you, sir.<eos> - I'm here to take you to the port.<eos> - What's going on? - It's war, sir.<eos> - What, here?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Everywhere.<eos> I'm to make sure you're safe and drive you to the ship.
- I'm here to take you to the port.<eos> - What's going on? - It's war, sir.<eos> - What, here?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Everywhere.<eos> I'm to make sure you're safe and drive you to the ship.<eos> You're needed in Britain.<eos> Are you Mr Carter?<eos> I am, yes.<eos> Sir, I'm to ask you to report to the Army headquarters in Cairo.
Sir, I'm to ask you to report to the Army headquarters in Cairo.<eos> - I can't.<eos> I have work to do here.<eos> - Sir. You are being asked to report to Cairo for assignment to war duties.<eos> Get this lot rounded up.<eos> Check their papers and their names.<eos> - Don't you dare.<eos> These are my men.<eos> - Let the man do his job, Carter.<eos> I can take you with me now, sir.
What little mirage did you see on the horizon?<eos> All right.<eos> Go, find yourself a crew.<eos> Where's the cash coming from?<eos> Carnarvon's wiring it from London.<eos> While you're at it, get him to wire us some ice.<eos> (DOOR OPENS) Oh, Mr Carter!<eos> Selim.<eos> Come in. (GREETS HIM IN ARABIC)<eos> It's good to see you again. - And you.
Has anyone got anything at all?<eos> Extend the grid again.<eos> You're not taking any of your trenches down beyond a couple of feet.<eos> You just keep extending the area.<eos> You're not digging.<eos> You're hunting.<eos> We both know there's nothing left to find.<eos> Not that way, not big.<eos> Don't we?<eos> Telegram for you, Mr Carter.
- Tutmosis the Third?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> Carter?<eos> Are you home?<eos> Hello, Evelyn.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise.<eos> Is Carter here?<eos> What is it?<eos> My father wants to see you.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise.<eos> Is Carter here?<eos> What is it?<eos> My father wants to see you.<eos> - Is it important?<eos> - Oh, there isn't anything really.<eos> I just didn't fancy explaining myself.<eos> Does your father know you're here?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> I thought about you a lot during the war.
You are still English, aren't you?<eos> It's hard to tell sometimes.<eos> Well, you have a house.<eos> And a dress coat.<eos> And a canary in a cage.<eos> Ah. Well, that settles it. I must be English.<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Let's try over here.<eos> Who taught you about the pharaohs?
I'm never there and I have savings.<eos> Just give me the concession for one more season.<eos> Just one.<eos> You're that certain?<eos> It's there.<eos> - Sell your house?<eos> - I will put in everything I've got.<eos> Your concession, my money.<eos> You wouldn't have anything to lose.<eos> Damn you, man!

Knew you were the right man for the job.<eos> I've never heard of this Tutankhamun.<eos> If I'm right, that would mean that he is buried here.<eos> Thought about you a lot during the war.
- Of course, I understand.<eos> But should there become something to discuss in due course, if your endeavours bear fruit of any kind, may I just say that the Times would consider it a privilege to be allowed to cover the story.<eos> I mean, I would consider it a privilege.<eos> You came all the way from Cairo to say that?<eos> Mr Carter, I'd go almost to the ends of the earth right now to find a story that doesn't involve Arabs rioting or British soldiers shooting people or civil unrest.<eos> Cairo to the Valley of the Kings was no distance at all.<eos> - Well, Mr, er...<eos> - Merton.<eos> Mr Merton. It seems we're both hoping for good news.<eos> If, and when, I have some... I'll be sure to let you know.
I merely wished to observe your methods firsthand.<eos> There have been one or two, erm... shall we say, unsettling rumours. Mm.<eos> Well, you can rest easy.<eos> Everything is here.<eos> Everything is properly accounted for.<eos> And yet, not everything has made its way to the Cairo Museum.<eos> Well, you see, we are sending items along as soon as they have been properly packed for transportation.<eos> Some of the items are particularly delicate.<eos> We are having to develop methods of preservation as we go along.<eos> But I was actually going to ask you, Mr Lacau, of the items that we have sent along to the Museum, we've yet to hear anything back on decisions of distribution of the finds. Er...
- I found this tomb.<eos> - Oh, you found the tomb?<eos> And that gives you the right to run roughshod over the press?<eos> And to make deals behind my back?<eos> They were made in good faith. My...<eos> Do you think that gives you licence to bed my daughter? You?<eos> How dare you?<eos> - Evelyn and I...<eos> - Lady Evelyn.<eos> I've put up with you.
What's going on?<eos> Get out my bloody way.<eos> Carter?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Give me that key.<eos> No.<eos> Very well, sir.<eos> If you wish it.<eos> By order of the Antiquities Service, I am revoking your permission to dig here.<eos> Leave at once or I will have you escorted from the area by the police!
It is the discovery of our age and you are allowing it to fall the pieces.<eos> It is not matter of my allowing -<eos> My father's expenditure, time and funds has furnished your department with the greatest archaeological discovery the world has seen.<eos> And neither you nor this department has had to lift one finger or paid one penny for this to happen!<eos> Lady Evelyn, if you please I'm sure that matter will be settled in time.<eos> Your father's estate is seeking compensation.<eos> And all it took was the threat of legal action<eos> Every minute we waste here, the contents of the tomb are rotting away.<eos> I have no argument with you, Lady Evelyn.<eos> I am more than happy for you to finish what your father started.
And another beer can.<eos> Well, here's where the ancient drunken tribe of...<eos> Look.<eos> Is that what she looks like when she's having a vision?<eos> I've gotta go talk to Clive.<eos> A witness saw you outside the shelter flashing a roll of cash.<eos> Where'd you get the money?<eos> I had my broker sell some tech stocks.<eos> This might help.<eos> So, I just got word that a witness places you at a bar across the street minutes before the murder.
Scene 34 revisions.<eos> Sweet. Can I get a copy for my friend here?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I'm lucky.<eos> I was born with one of those kinds of minds that, uh...<eos> How do you call 'em again?<eos> - Photographic?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm messing with you. Seriously, though, I only need to hear the words a few times before I lock 'em in.
Yeah, he could be a real...<eos> I guess the word is...<eos> You dick!<eos> You want everyone to know that you released that video, not some burglar?<eos> Because I will tell the world!<eos> I don't think you will.<eos> Copy that.<eos> They need you in wardrobe.<eos> Oh, you're free to go.<eos> We know where to find you.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Vaughn! Open the damn door!<eos> Open the damn door!<eos> - Wonder how'd they'd fight...<eos> - Vaughn!<eos> Vaughn!<eos> If that was fresh.<eos> Open the damn door!<eos> - Yeah, can't hear you.
- Yeah, can't hear you.<eos> - Just let me out of here.<eos> Help me.<eos> Help me.<eos> For the love of God, just let me out of here.<eos> Just let me out!<eos> You did it, my boy.<eos> You did it, you did it!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to put you through that.
- Yes, you do. Science commonly holds the belief that 5% to 10% of your male friends are gay.<eos> Not in Bailey Downs.<eos> Especially in Bailey Downs.<eos> The point is, you can't tell, so don't act gay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, so while you're waiting for the doctor,<eos> I'm just gonna get you started on some paperwork and a sperm sample.<eos> So, who's going to be the father?<eos> I am.<eos> I guess we'll just test you both.
Where are you hiding?<eos> Rachel's hidden deep.<eos> Who is she reaching out to?<eos> You?<eos> So you are Ferdinand.<eos> Who is this mysterious source of Sarah's?<eos> Insider? Outsider?<eos> I've been racking my brains.<eos> Biscuit?<eos> I admire you, Siobhan.
Well, we should have the test results in a few days.<eos> Urn, do you have an egg donor in mind?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - We are still narrowing it down. - Yeah.<eos> You know, we should tell you, too, that we are thrilled to be working with you.<eos> And we're both very open to any kind of emerging technologies.<eos> Well, you two are healthy young men.<eos> I doubt you'll have any problems conceiving.<eos> Dr. Bosch, we were told to ask for you specifically.
Sarah's Deep Throat is a sheep.<eos> I have information about Susan Duncan and Rachel.<eos> That is excellent news.<eos> Now, let's take off the mask, shall we?<eos> I would not stand up if I were you.<eos> Whatever this is, it's not necessary.<eos> Oh, yes, it is.<eos> What's your name? Hmm?<eos> I should know you, but I don't.<eos> I know you.
You killed six of my sisters.<eos> Murdered 32 of our friends and loved ones.<eos> What's stopping me from standing up and killing one more?<eos> You tell me.<eos> (Iowa rd ice?<eos> Narcissism?<eos> Rachel?<eos> Rachel? She was hidden deep.<eos> You found her?<eos> I found you first.

- Sarah Stubbs. - That's her name, Sarah Stubbs. - Yes.<eos> Mr. Hendrix, when we ask your wife a question, you need to let her answer.<eos> I mean, I don't know if that's true.<eos> Actually, I'm just saying, legally, I don't think that's true.<eos> So, other than this Sarah Stubbs, who else had involvement in your campaign, Mrs. Hendrix?<eos> Carol Lombart was coordinator,<eos> Trevor Sawatzky did transportation, and Kathy Melichi hung posters.<eos> But my biggest support was my husband.<eos> He's my rock.<eos> - Good to see you. - Yes, thank you.
From what, Dobermans?<eos> I'm nothing like my brothers, Ms. Manning.<eos> You're safe here.<eos> Sarah, please sit.<eos> Before we discuss Kendall, I wanna know what this thing's doing to me.<eos> The devices do different things for different subjects.<eos> For instance, you mentioned Aldous Leekie.<eos> He had one treating a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's.<eos> But what's mine doing?<eos> It's making you sick.
- Stop it!<eos> - You manipulate us.<eos> Turn around!<eos> - We guide you.<eos> I saw you graduate. You recall?<eos> Get on your knees.<eos> You polished that badge to a mirror shine.<eos> I said get down.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> If I kill you, it's over. The monitors. The testing.
If anything's happened, it wasn't me.<eos> We have to go, S.<eos> Yeah, you're coming with us.<eos> And your life depends on what happens next.<eos> - Do you understand me?<eos> - Not just mine. What about Cosima?<eos> She's still at Brightborn.<eos> The power source is metabolic, from the host's own tissue.<eos> A synthetic ATP chain.<eos> Nature is just a set of spare parts to you, isn't it?
I'm so sorry.<eos> Do you mean Dr. Delphine Cormier?<eos> Why, do you know her?<eos> Is she involved in this?<eos> Well, she's a friend of ours.<eos> What can you tell us about her?<eos> I'm so sorry, um...<eos> I saw her get shot.<eos> I saw everything.<eos> No one will find you here.
It won't be long.<eos> If you're too cold, I have a spare blanket.<eos> Nasty business that we're wrapped up in, isn't it?<eos> Someone's got their hooks in ya.<eos> I've been hunted around the world.<eos> What's your story?<eos> I'm just in over my head, lady. Just like everybody else.<eos> We can help you.<eos> My daughter, she hides people.<eos> How's that working out for you?
Evie...<eos> It's the big clay, congratulations.<eos> Your science has won.<eos> Looks like just in time, Dr. Van Lier.<eos> Shingles.<eos> Yes. A side effect of leaning on immunosuppressants most of my life.<eos> Well, you brought gene therapy a long way. Miles since we treated you when you were a teenager, Evie.<eos> Miles?<eos> Ian, you've always said, "This is a science of nanometers."<eos> I am so proud of you.
Oh, thank God.<eos> I thought Mama was losing it for a minute.<eos> You look just like her, except with, you know, less anger and more hygiene.<eos> Felix, this isn't gonna work.<eos> - She reeks of alcohol.<eos> - Ma'am, you're about to miss your visitation window.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm in conference with my client and she will not be denied her right to see her husband.<eos> Let me just have a look at this.<eos> I don't want anyone frisking you.
- You the lawyer?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I'm kind of a stopgap, but, yeah.<eos> She's Felix's sister, Adele.<eos> Felix has a sister?<eos> Just... just don't think about it right now.<eos> But...<eos> How much does she know?<eos> I don't need to know anything just yet, okay?<eos> Nothing that might incriminate you.
So how's Donnie?<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> - S, where the hell are you?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> What matters is I think I know how Evie Cho is gonna try and get to us.<eos> Why is Neolution harassing my husband?<eos> Donnie's innocent.<eos> You know what, this has got nothing to do with you and Donnie.<eos> You're just caught in the crossfire.<eos> And the people I work for would be more than happy to let you and your family live your lives.
You and Donnie are stalwart members of our congregation.<eos> But recently I... I feel like you've begun to take your... Your faith for granted.<eos> Reverend, the... The... The police and the arrest, that was all a huge misunderstanding.<eos> Was it?<eos> I'm sure the children who witnessed it are gonna be just fine.<eos> You know, with proper therapy.<eos> All I know, Ali, is you've got a secret laying heavy on your heart, and I can help you.<eos> It's an impossible situation, no one can help.<eos> Just... just try me.<eos> What if someone asked you to do something and if you did it, then you would protect someone you love, but hurt someone else that you care about?
Don't do it before the question!<eos> Jesus! What's Evie up to, Martin?<eos> She's got approval for her bot technology, she's planning on putting into millions of people, under the guise of gene therapy.<eos> But what's she really doing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Remaking man in her own image, by chopping my balls off?<eos> It's not my end of things!<eos> Jesus!<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll work for you.
Changing their clients' children's DNA without consent.<eos> She wants to get the technology to the public within three years.<eos> Jesus. Evie Cho might be a more cunning villain than you, Rachel.<eos> Her villainy is exactly how we get her.<eos> Go on.<eos> Evie developed her tech with illegal human trials.<eos> We've learned that two carriers recently fled the Brightborn maternity lab.<eos> Tabitha Stewart and Kendra Dupree.<eos> You want to find them before Evie does?<eos> No, we want you to.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.<eos> It came for you this morning. "Leave us alone, or the whole video goes online."<eos> Like I'm going to let that happen.<eos> They could ruin everything.<eos> - Why haven't we found them? - We are working on it.<eos> Traced the email to a fixed address, but the less you know about that, the better.<eos> And what should I know about Detective Duko?<eos> He disappeared tailing Sarah.<eos> Evie, you need to focus on the press conference tonight.<eos> I have jobs for each of you.
Okay-<eos> She's gone.<eos> The next day we ran.<eos> I named him Jacob.<eos> They put this beautiful baby in me, but he was born blind.<eos> If they find him, they'll put him down, too.<eos> If you're willing to come forward with this, we could expose them.<eos> We could end all this.<eos> Look, you take the video and you leave me out of it.<eos> That won't work, Kendra. Without you, the video could be discounted.
We need that contingency plan.<eos> All right, but there's a complication.<eos> - He's sleeping.<eos> - All right.<eos> We're not safe here. We need, ah...<eos> We need you to come with us.<eos> Like protective custody?<eos> Honestly, there are police that we can't trust.<eos> But we've got a safe house, and it's very well protected.<eos> This is crazy. I don't even know you people.

I don't even know you people.<eos> Brightborn is after us, too.<eos> And we both have daughters, and we put them first every day, just like you're doing with Jacob.
But we need you to help us end this.<eos> Could you go get him, please?<eos> Quiet.<eos> They're outside.<eos> - Kendra! - Let her go, let her go.<eos> She'll keep him quiet.<eos> Whose phone is that?<eos> Landline. - Whoa.<eos> Listen to me carefully.<eos> I have an associate waiting for you in a car outside.
What happened?<eos> She's gone with Ira.<eos> Rachel's screwing us.<eos> I'm so stupid.<eos> Did you kill that woman at the shelter? Hey? Hey?<eos> Oh, no, no! Hey!<eos> We're not doing this. We're going to drop them off at the precinct.<eos> We'll be out by morning.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, I'll be real interested to see who springs you.
Good time to skedaddle. - Yep.<eos> Let's get out of here...<eos> Wait! Flip flops.<eos> - Er, basement. Basement.<eos> - Right. Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Oh, Lord!<eos> Sorry to barge in. We're going to have a little chat.<eos> Okay-<eos> Large-scale clinical trials are just the beginning.<eos> Soon, Brightborn will offer advanced gene therapy directly to you and your families.
Where's Rachel?<eos> She's meeting with Evie.<eos> You let her do that?<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> You're stupid, mate.<eos> She is playing you. Rachel just wants power.<eos> She'll cut us all down. Including you.<eos> You're supposed to be on the island.<eos> Well, I'm here.<eos> And lucky for you, I have your solution.
'Cause I basically don't believe anything you're saying right now.<eos> Are you guys even for real?<eos> Yeah!<eos> If you have any questions, we're happy to help.<eos> Krystal, we talked about this. And we told you that the less you know, the better. Remember?<eos> Well, that's not good enough for me anymore.<eos> Okay? If you want the scoop on Van Lier, you're gonna have to tell me everything.<eos> All right.<eos> Buzz us down.<eos> I warn you, Krystal, this is gonna come as a bit of a shock.
- Hey, I'm gonna be back soon, okay?<eos> I kn ow.<eos> I'm worried about all the sisters.<eos> There's so many we don't even know.<eos> We're doing this for all of them, too.<eos> I want us all to be free.<eos> Mother?<eos> Why didn't anyone fetch me?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I've seen you before.
It's the man behind the curtain.<eos> The man who wrote the book over a century ago.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Not for him.<eos> What else am I supposed to do?<eos> What does he have to say about it?<eos> He's not happy about any of this.<eos> Of course.<eos> Altruism poses a distinct challenge to the evolutionist.<eos> His altruism saved you.
- Yes I do.<eos> I'm looking for Ana, she lives here on the second floor.<eos> I buzzed a couple of hours ago, but it looks like nobody's there.<eos> Ana is out of town.<eos> Can I get your name or do you want a message?<eos> Oh!<eos> Yes? Can you tell her that Alice was here.<eos> - Oh! You're Alice!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Ok, I do have something for you.

Say it again.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You ran from me, but it's no problem.<eos> I just took one picture.<eos> It's a beautiful picture, do you want to see it?<eos> Are you following me?<eos> No, it's?<eos> just the moment.<eos> I'm interested in the moment, you know?<eos> And I saw you and...
- Yes.<eos> I work in Salzburg and I make this trip everyday and...<eos> I'm looking for moments to enjoy.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I just lost my train.<eos> - You lost your train?<eos> You want to play around on a train taking pictures?<eos> Just fool around?<eos> Have a drink maybe?<eos> What do you think?
Yeah.<eos> - Nine months ago.<eos> - Short time? - Yeah.<eos> - He was young?<eos> - Full of life.<eos> - Full of life, that's terrible!<eos> - Have something to eat.<eos> - I'm not hungry.<eos> Try it.<eos> It is good for you.
- He was young?<eos> - Full of life.<eos> - Full of life, that's terrible!<eos> - Have something to eat.<eos> - I'm not hungry.<eos> Try it.<eos> It is good for you.<eos> You have to drink something, you have to eat something.<eos> It's good for the health.<eos> It makes you happy, food.
Oh, come, now.<eos> At least take a pomegranate.<eos> You know, I always found them too much trouble.<eos> Sweet fruit surrounded by bitter -- they're something of a contradiction, but heaven for the effort.<eos> You park some chocolate in front of me and watch it go bye-bye, but pomegranates -- just not for me, thanks.<eos> Well, if there's anything you want or need -- if you enjoy music, we have a guitarist whose talent brings tears to the eye, and we have a small choir.<eos> Thank you. All I need is some more rest... and maybe a hairbrush.<eos> No one told me I'd be meeting royalty.<eos> Anyway... uh, Your Majesty --<eos> I should call you "Your Majesty," right?
You people said you got them all.<eos> We thought we did.<eos> It was just an outpost.<eos> H-How many of them were there?<eos> There were a lot.<eos> Maybe hundreds.<eos> Do they know the deal you made us take, Marsha?<eos> - It's Maggie.<eos> - No.<eos> And we didn't make you take the deal, Gregory.
I will show you around.<eos> Come on, kid.<eos> I'll show you around.<eos> You know, you do the same damn stink-eye as your dad, except it's only half as good 'cause... well, you know, you're... missing an eye.<eos> Really?<eos> You're really not gonna take my hand?<eos> 'Cause you're lucky you even still have a hand.<eos> Same as your boy Daryl over here, now that I think about it.<eos> How's the job going, Daryl?<eos> Hot enough for you?
Are all of those women actually your...<eos> Wives? Yeah.<eos> Always wanted to screw a whole bunch of different women.<eos> I mean, why settle for just one?<eos> Why follow the same old rules?<eos> Why not make life better?<eos> Speaking of... sit.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> Started on what?<eos> I want to get to know you a little better, Carl.
Let Mark's face be a daily reminder to him and to everyone else that the rules matter.<eos> I hope that we all learned something today, because I don't ever... want to have to do that again.<eos> Some crazy shit, huh?<eos> You probably think I'm a lunatic.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go figure out what to do with you.<eos> I didn't want to come back here.<eos> I don't...<eos> No.<eos> I asked you to make me a bullet.
You got something to say?<eos> Why haven't you killed me?<eos> Or my dad or Daryl?<eos> Daryl... is gonna make a good soldier for me.<eos> You see, he thinks he's holding it together... but you saw it.<eos> Your dad?<eos> He's already getting me great stuff.<eos> You, on the other hand...<eos> Well, we shall see.<eos> It's more productive to break you.
Hey, neighbor.<eos> Why don't you come by later?<eos> We might grill out.<eos> Oh, I like it here.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I might just have to stay here.<eos> You know, I was thinking about what you said earlier, Carl.<eos> Maybe it is stupid keeping you and your dad alive.<eos> I mean, why am I trying so hard?<eos> Maybe I should just bury you both down in one of those flower beds.
Well, it's starting to look like it's true.<eos> And there... there's gotta be some way to clear the air.<eos> Make reparations.<eos> Forty acres and some eggs.<eos> Why don't you tell them again how many black friends you have in your kitchen and your field?<eos> Okay, you shut up, you PC hippie hypocrite.<eos> I would wager that your last address before you came here wasn't exactly in the inner city.<eos> At least I didn't talk to puppets that used the word "jigaboo."<eos> Hmm? No more eggs for you.<eos> An inmate from Litchfield Federal Prison is attempting to contact you.
Got a lot on your mind.<eos> Got some nerve.<eos> You got make-believe on your mind.<eos> You know, maybe you can... start in someone else's place.<eos> Learn the business and take over that shit.<eos> You'll run it in no time.<eos> You're like that bug that takes over the other bug and controls it and everything.<eos> And you're really good at figuring out business stuff, so...<eos> What color you want?<eos> Oh, CO Bayley, I asked you politely to please wait outside.
Will you watch the sauce?<eos> Keep stirring.<eos> -Who was it?<eos> -Oh, it was no one.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> -Who the hell is that?<eos> -It's no one.<eos> It's probably just a salesperson.<eos> I hear you, Mr. Caputo.
Get out of my office.<eos> Out!<eos> And after you got the camera to Burset, how were you gonna get the photo out?<eos> That ten-year-old Motorola didn't even have Internet.<eos> I have my ways.<eos> Oh. Well, don't ever become a spy.<eos> Sophia is falling apart down here.<eos> At least I didn't stand by idly.<eos> So, if you want to punish me for having a... a conscience, then, fine.<eos> I am not punishing you for your conscience.

He was my boy.<eos> How's James?<eos> He has no major internal injuries.<eos> With his ability to heal, he should be fine.<eos> Katarina, what happened to me?<eos> The tether we detected was not connected to another time-traveler physically but instead to a consciousness.<eos> It was a signal from somewhere in time.<eos> And your mind... Was the receiver.<eos> This is what The Witness did to you.<eos> He used you against us.

That's all I know or care about.<eos> I'm sorry but we've all lost a lot while you've been here sleeping.<eos> And this whole story of yours is just a little too weird.<eos> Back up.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Break it up.<eos> Hey, what'd I tell you about this woman?<eos> Get your ass outta here!<eos> This woman is the reason we were attacked last night.<eos> You need to back the hell up and get the hell outta here, now. Go!
Now!<eos> No, not Norman.<eos> With a G. Is that your first name or your last name?<eos> Yeah, first.<eos> Jones is my last.<eos> Gorman Jones, tell us again what you're doing here.<eos> Like I said before, I got separated with my group and, you know, we got in a fight with some of them mother suckers.<eos> Is that your name for vampires?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, you know, some people look at me funny when I say it, but the shoe fit.<eos> Look, you can call 'em whatever you want.
Molly?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> This is another property that I was wanting to show you.<eos> I think it's a fabulous, fabulous location. Oh, Molly!<eos> Wow, perfect timing.<eos> I know it's a little unorthodox, but I'd like to introduce you to Randall Slade, he's our newest client.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> Hey, Molly.<eos> I am totally stoked to meet you.
Hey, let her stay, man.<eos> She's hot.<eos> Can you help me?<eos> Sure. I'm Jackson West.<eos> Jackson West.<eos> I know that name.<eos> And you know a lot about wine.<eos> Yeah, that's why I work here.<eos> You're the Jackson West.<eos> Do I know you?
You must be Molly Dawson.<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> Come.<eos> Let's discuss this offer of yours.<eos> How was your drive?<eos> It was beautiful.<eos> So, what's your name?<eos> Liz.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> Alright, Elizabeth. I'll take you over here.
At least take a look at the offer.<eos> Oh dear.<eos> Seven.<eos> Oh dear.<eos> Well, um... uh, I'll mention this to the owners.<eos> We own several trending brands and trademarks...<eos> Do you need a minute?<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> Well, I'll uh... I'll hang on to this and um...<eos> I'll see you out.
Who found whom?<eos> Two months you called my phone every night!<eos> And on top of that, you named your dog Molly?<eos> Only a stalker would name his dog after his ex-girlfriend! Hah!<eos> Ok, it's not exactly your name, ok?<eos> It's only Molly with one...<eos> "L". Moly.<eos> Jackson?<eos> Yes.<eos> May I have a word with you?
Did you get caught in traffic?<eos> I should have said something. I teach at the cultural centre.<eos> Teacher?<eos> Yeah, uh... three days a week.<eos> Hey, um, a couple months after you left I sold everything and I made a few investments and I should-<eos> We have a lot to do.<eos> I have some paperwork that I need you to look over and help me with.<eos> Special delivery.<eos> Oh, you can put those in my car, I don't want them.<eos> They're not for you.
I make like half a million a day on interest alone, so why would I care about price?<eos> Now, can't you just tell them I agree?<eos> Not without Nancy's approval.<eos> I can get in trouble.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> I'll up your commission five percent.<eos> She's gonna find out.<eos> If she finds out we accepted the offer, then I found a new real estate agent.<eos> Ok, there's a friend of mine who manages the vineyard.<eos> If I do this for you, you keep him on as manager.
We thought you might know where he is.<eos> Say... I did know where Father is, and let's say that I gave you permission to speak to him,<eos> I would suspect that if he came to harm in any way, there would be, uh, consequences.<eos> Now, the good Father doesn't believe that cleanliness is next to Godliness, so you will find his tent by way of smell.<eos> You have my permission.<eos> We'll see you soon, Bobo.<eos> Time will tell.<eos> Tick-tock. Tick-tock.<eos> Robert Malick?<eos> - Father Malick to you.
Why would your friend Henry kill him? - He didn't.<eos> - The only other person in here.<eos> Yeah, but we know he's not a revenant, and the killer - has to be.<eos> - I still don't trust him.<eos> Why not?<eos> What are you two not telling me about your friend Henry?<eos> Guess I'll have to find out for myself.<eos> Wynonna's told me a lot about you.<eos> Peculiar.<eos> She has told me - nothing about you, Mr...?
He decides who is the law.<eos> And... he could shut us down, so we need to be on his good side.<eos> So get yourself chest already.<eos> Dressed. Already.<eos> Don't wanna keep Judgey Manager Dude waiting.<eos> Cryderman.<eos> Let's not keep Judge Cryderman waiting.<eos> Record scratch.<eos> Judge who?<eos> I've been meaning to call you in, but we've had some unfortunate issues with the Town Planner.
- Could be anything.<eos> Then why are his colleagues guarding it with guns?<eos> He has connections. Do you know what that means?<eos> It means trouble.<eos> But only if my partner and I overstep our bounds.<eos> I don't like extra work cluttering things up.<eos> You know what I've heard?<eos> There's a bumper crop of mallards this year.<eos> You a duck-huntin' man?<eos> Maybe I'll give you a call on migration day.
- But you know, we...<eos> - We?<eos> There's no "we."<eos> 'Cause if there was, that would just be way...<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - Yeah, exactly.<eos> Wait, what are you asking me?<eos> Wynonna...<eos> I need you to arrange a meeting for me with Deputy Marshal Dolls.<eos> Yes, but with all due respect, sir, I heard you the first time.
If you know where they are - and you're not telling me...<eos> - I swear I don't.<eos> Look.<eos> I need you to understand.<eos> See, we didn't have a daddy.<eos> Mama had some money, but she put it all into an old hotel and restaurant.<eos> Back then, if food didn't have maggots in it, they practically gave it - a Michelin Star.<eos> - OK, no more food talk.<eos> Ms. Olive, you don't have to live like this.<eos> We could take you somewhere where people could understand what you are.
Oh, my God.<eos> Is that your car?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> That's my mom's car!<eos> So how do we know this is safe?<eos> Well, define "safe."<eos> Safe, as in my brain's not gonna melt.<eos> No. It's a simple feedback loop, Ramon, all right?<eos> When you vibe on Barry, your brain waves send me the necessary data to pinpoint whatever dimensional pocket or corner of the universe that Barry is stuck in.<eos> And then we electrically stimulate your prefrontal cortex while opening a breach, which gives you physical access to Barry and lets you be the beacon to guide him home.
Higher frequency.<eos> - Higher frequency on the Earth-2 spectrum.<eos> And when that pulse hits anyone from Earth-2...<eos> It'll disrupt their nervous system.<eos> Earth-2 metas go night-night.<eos> - Even Zoom?<eos> - Even Zoom.<eos> Harry and Jesse are from Earth-2.<eos> How do we keep the pulse from hurting them?<eos> Oh, Detective, I didn't know you cared.
- Okay.<eos> I just figured that since Henry is officially back for good, we should celebrate.<eos> And since Zoom is gone and the city is quiet right now.<eos> Oh, I appreciate it, Iris.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hi, Tina.<eos> - Hello, Henry.<eos> - Jesse.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Good to see you.

You might want to say your good-byes.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna save your dad.<eos> No. You're gonna save our dad.<eos> Get back to S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> It's safer.<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> We got eyes and ears right here.<eos> Either he goes, or we all die together.<eos> We believe in you.
- Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, maybe I can continue that sentiment, take something from him, for a change, make it my own.<eos> It suits you.<eos> Thank you, all of you, for saving me from Zoom, especially you, Flash.<eos> You're welcome, Flash.<eos> Now all I have to do is find my way home.<eos> - And where's that?<eos> - I think you would call it Earth-3.<eos> Well, I can get you to Earth-2.
Harry.<eos> You have great kids.<eos> You take care of them. Same to you.<eos> You take care of that beautiful girl.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm a better man than I was when I got here,<eos> - and that's 'cause of you.<eos> - I'm not the same either.<eos> Hey, don't be surprised if I project myself over to Earth-2 every once in a while, you know, just to throw your stuff across the office.<eos> I'll miss you too, Cisco.
Then stop making them nervous.<eos> Tell me what you want.<eos> What I need from you is the same kind of help you're getting from me.<eos> I don't want to fester and die in one deputy slot after another.<eos> I need some serious fucking intelligence, Golda.<eos> Better yet, a recruitment.<eos> You want us to run a dangle into you? Fake your way to the top?<eos> How do you think most of my bosses got their jobs?<eos> I need to start flying at Steven's altitude.<eos> And if this operation against losava goes forward, that would get you moving, wouldn't it?
What kind of Islam do you want your children to grow up with?<eos> Once again from the top.<eos> When I look at them, I see compromise, the whole fucking bunch of them.<eos> You know what my dad did with his time on earth?<eos> He went on civil-rights marches, stopped whaling boats with his own two hands, ambushed cops in Kent State, drank himself through the mad, nasty fucking '70s.<eos> Never took no for an answer.<eos> Never said no.<eos> What's that?<eos> All the details of Clare's operation.<eos> There's no time if you want Ingrid Hollander to publish tomorrow.
Give it to me!<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> You know what?<eos> Great timing, because your pop machine is on the fritz.<eos> Give... it... back!<eos> Oh no, you don't.<eos> Nobody hides from Ashley J. Williams.<eos> This part of the hospital is off limits.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I could ask you the same thing.
This is what we wanted, remember?<eos> Easy for you to say.<eos> It's my name on the show.<eos> This is why I didn't want to do another TV show.<eos> Everything was perfect.<eos> BoJack, this shit is bananas.<eos> B-A-N-A-N-A-S.<eos> I can't promise everyone will love this show.<eos> No matter what, people will remember it.<eos> Five, ten years from now, this is the show people will associate you with, and you'll be glad they do.
We can't stay here much longer.<eos> We need to find shelter on land.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> We'll starve.<eos> He's too weak.<eos> We'd never get him past the beach.<eos> Alex, please.<eos> I owe him.<eos> Look, if you care for this boy, you have to consider what he needs, what is truly best for him.<eos> What's the matter with you?
- How long?<eos> - Well, I can rebuild a carburetor, but boats aren't really my forte.<eos> How long?<eos> All day. More or less.<eos> I got to feel my way through it. I mean, look at this.<eos> If that filter's gone... We don't have all day.<eos> Get it done.<eos> Hey, man, I am not the help.<eos> Clearly.<eos> I've upset you.
Mexico?<eos> Where the hell are you taking us?<eos> Why don't we start by telling me who's been meddling in my business?<eos> This is my business. It's all of our business.<eos> - Perhaps our Latin friend?<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> I saved Nick from that death camp.<eos> And then we saved you, Victor, remember?<eos> - I welcome you into my home.<eos> - Who got you to your home?
Strangers. Friends.<eos> - This is my family.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Your family.<eos> We're just gonna eat each other alive. We have to go back to back to get this done.<eos> Good.<eos> Good.<eos> And, Victor, you even look wrong at anyone in my family, I will throw you overboard.<eos> You're not a killer.<eos> Hey. I got something for you.
Codones.<eos> So amoxicillin, oxycodone.<eos> Yeah, no, this is useless.<eos> - Where's Chris?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Stay with your sister.<eos> Chris!<eos> Chris!<eos> Come on, hurry.<eos> - I got you. - No...
If you want a return on your investment, I'll oblige.<eos> You'll pay me back.<eos> I intended to with interest.<eos> We can discuss the details.<eos> Tom, the man stole from you.<eos> Meet me downstairs.<eos> I'll be the one at the bar.<eos> Thank you... For the pardon.<eos> I didn't pardon you.<eos> I obligated you.
- As if I'm gonna find any.<eos> When exactly was the last time you felt her move?<eos> Shut up.<eos> If she died, she may have turned.<eos> She'd feel that, though, wouldn't she?<eos> If that thing was moving inside of her, she would have probably felt that.<eos> - I said shut the hell up.<eos> - Daniel:<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> I'll shoot you and I'll toss you overboard.
I was getting strand into Mexico.<eos> He left when they boarded, when they tried to take the Abigail.<eos> - Victor escaped?<eos> - They shot at his raft.<eos> He went down.<eos> I have to go after Travis.<eos> I have to find Alicia.<eos> We do not cross the border without him.<eos> We don't need strand.<eos> Well, he didn't need you either, but here you are.
He made me get real close.<eos> I could barely hear him.<eos> And he whispered, "Don't let me drown."<eos> So I put my hands around his throat and I squeezed.<eos> And then I pushed him out of the raft.<eos> You did what you had to do.<eos> I did what you made me do.<eos> When Connor found me just this side of death, the first thing he said to me was,<eos> "What do you have to offer?"<eos> I offered him your Abigail. But I asked for you.
_ _<eos> _<eos> Stop!<eos> Padre, stop.<eos> We are left no choice.<eos> You're fighting death with death.<eos> That's madness.<eos> You are a good person, Tom Abigail.<eos> Do not protect her.<eos> I'm protecting you from those who work for me.
_<eos> It's Madison.<eos> Do we like her?<eos> She's fierce.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I didn't know if either of you were feeling up to it.<eos> It was a lovely thought.<eos> I'm Madison.<eos> Tom.<eos> It's nice to meet you, Tom.
- I'm okay.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - I should go.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Will you promise me something?<eos> Tell me what it is.<eos> Will you look after him when I'm gone?<eos> Must we be so maudlin?<eos> He won't make it easy.<eos> Why do you think I'm asking you?
You tell him the truth.<eos> That you looked inside yourself, deep into the place where your soul should be and you found it empty.<eos> You tell him that!<eos> _<eos> No, that's enough.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Who are you?<eos> His friend.<eos> You are his fool.
Don't do this.<eos> Don't put him in the ground.<eos> What?<eos> This place is unholy.<eos> It's infected.<eos> Even the dirt.<eos> The walls in this place. That woman, her dead.<eos> Hey.<eos> Your friend, he won't rest.<eos> He'll come back for you.
_<eos> Those creatures you keep, they are an abomination, an act against God.<eos> It's not my dead you fear, viejo. It is your own.<eos> _<eos> Cuántos, eh?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> _ _<eos> They haunt you.
You are dying.<eos> Can you feel it?<eos> Speak while you still have words.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I have nothing to tell you.<eos> I have nothing to say to you.<eos> I don't want you to worry, Daniel.<eos> I will take care of you.
And you didn't find me.<eos> He needs his father.<eos> - Travis.<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> Tell her you never saw us.<eos> Chris can't come back, not now.<eos> I can't come back.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> Happens every day.<eos> You get older, you learn to forgive yourself.
You led me right to you.<eos> Now I'm going to kill you, just like I killed your father!<eos> I didn't really kill your father, that just kind of sounded cool.<eos> The point is, you're dead!<eos> Ash, it's me.<eos> Your doctor.<eos> You know, Ruby said this would be hard.<eos> Buddy, I've had harder turds.<eos> You are a joke of a demon!<eos> We will break you of these delusions, Ash.

You're a murderer.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No, no!<eos> I'm truly sorry to make you watch this, Ash.<eos> I simply can't find any other way, to impress upon you how increasingly violent, and unstable your behavior has become.<eos> That's not me.<eos> I'm afraid it is, Ash.<eos> As I'm afraid I've failed you.<eos> Transferring you to another facility.
That's not me.<eos> I'm afraid it is, Ash.<eos> As I'm afraid I've failed you.<eos> Transferring you to another facility.<eos> One that's better equipped to deal with patients like you.<eos> I'm sorry to say that their treatment methods are... less progressive than mine.<eos> Barbaric, even.<eos> That's not me.<eos> Very well.<eos> I've arranged a visitor for you.
Two, around me, you stay absolutely quiet.<eos> Three, when we get where we're going, we're gonna see some real hijos de puta.<eos> Unless I tell you, you stay--<eos> Absolutely quiet.<eos> Put on your makeup.<eos> I can smell you from here.<eos> So one thing before I can't talk anymore.<eos> Why me?<eos> Because, gringuito, nobody's gonna miss you.<eos> Who's gonna miss you?
Lo siento.<eos> What?<eos> It means I'm sorry.<eos> If we were sitting here before it all went to hell, maybe both of us would have skipped down to Rosarito.<eos> No, it wouldn't have happened.<eos> Steven and I always took the kids to Joshua Tree.<eos> Ah, you never know.<eos> I could have come down to see Tom, you would have been on some god-awful family getaway.<eos> You would have snuck away from your motherly duties, snuck down to the bar and found me.<eos> I would have sat next to you.

You do that girl no favors.<eos> So you're just gonna wait?<eos> What good is faith when the water runs out?<eos> This is a test.<eos> The dead are walking toward their final resting place.<eos> And when they leave, when the world is washed clean of death, we the faithful will remain.<eos> We have been chosen.<eos> We will outlast death.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Why are you so sure?
Oh, I was a Goober, all right.<eos> I Goobed with the best of 'em.<eos> But that ain't me anymore.<eos> I'm now the proprietor/spokesperson/ number one customer of Whale World.<eos> At Whale World, families come together to admire the fine female form of the majestic killer whale.<eos> It's educational.<eos> Join us in the Splash Zone.<eos> You and your little ones are gonna get moist.<eos> Whoo-hoo!<eos> These orcas have the floppiest dorsal fins in town and they can't wait to jump through hoops for you and your kids.
- Police!<eos> - Oh, God, not again. Gotcha!<eos> Richie Osborne, you're under arrest.<eos> - Oh, right, Reggie.<eos> - Richie.<eos> That's what I said. I said Rickie.<eos> Thank God.<eos> How did you find us?<eos> Your Twitter account is hooked up to your phone's location services.<eos> We've been tracking you through your tweets all night.

Elena!<eos> Take it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, Alicia.<eos> What the hell took you so long?<eos> I had to make sure they were all clear so you can get downstairs.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> You're my guide.<eos> I haven't left the tower since it began.<eos> Look, Hector needs you.
I couldn't let it spread.<eos> I locked them in...<eos> Hector and I... till help could come.<eos> It never did.<eos> There was no one there to save us.<eos> People die.<eos> Now they hate me.<eos> I've seen worse.<eos> We've done worse.<eos> I won't let them touch you.
Make that three dates.<eos> Who knows when I'll get another night off?<eos> I do.<eos> And you won't.<eos> Excuse me, my good man.<eos> My movie, starring me, the movie star, just opened. We'd like to sit at the bar.<eos> Drinks on the house.<eos> Of course, Mr. Horseman.<eos> Right away, Mr. Horseman.<eos> [clears throat] Mr. Sutherland, I'm going to have to ask you to give up your seat for a movie star and his companion.
- Yeah, I got it.<eos> I was laughing at it because it was so bad, do you understand?<eos> - You're being very clear.<eos> - I feel like I'm not articulating.<eos> My enjoyment didn't come from a place of sincere admiration.<eos> It was more like, "What an ill-conceived television show.<eos> Who made those terrible choices?<eos> I can't stop watching."<eos> You don't have to keep--<eos> Anyway, I'm pretty much in love with you.
It's for work.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> But you'll call me if you're out late, right?<eos> - Yes. I'll call you.<eos> - Okay. Have a good time.<eos> Ugh! I'm sure I won't.<eos> Cool guys like that take me back to high school and I end up feeling like a huge nerd over again.<eos> The only kind of nerd you should feel like is hon-nerd that he selected you.<eos> Princess Carolyn, I made reservations for you tonight at Elefante.
It's a little hole in the wall, but they do a nice cheese plate. Hmm.<eos> Wow. Weird turn of events, huh?<eos> Nobody's fault, right?<eos> I'm gonna jet.<eos> You need to talk some sense into my daughter.<eos> Yeah, talking sense into people isn't really my thing.<eos> In fact, I'm better at the opposite.<eos> I once got Nic Cage to buy Charlie Chaplin's mustache on eBay. That was his last ten bucks.<eos> Please, BoJack.<eos> She'll listen to you.
Well, great, great. [chuckles]<eos> When can I see you again? When's your next night off? Oh.<eos> Did I say something?<eos> Is it because I asked for the glass of milk?<eos> - If you give me a cookie--<eos> - No, you're great.<eos> It's just running an agency doesn't give me a lot of nights off.<eos> Tell you what, here's my card.<eos> If you're ever free, give me a call.<eos> If not, I'll just meet somebody else and invite you to the wedding.
She in there?<eos> We met at UCSD.<eos> Took me a year to work up the courage to talk to her. Just to speak.<eos> I couldn't breathe.<eos> I know that feeling.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I never thought in a million years I'd put a ring on her finger.<eos> But you did.<eos> I know that feeling, too.<eos> I won't let you.
It's not fair.<eos> It's not.<eos> None of it.<eos> You living with this isn't fair either.<eos> For you.<eos> For her.<eos> That's not your wife.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Death parted you.
For you.<eos> For her.<eos> That's not your wife.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Death parted you.<eos> Your vows give you leave.<eos> I don't know what I am without her.<eos> You'll never be the same.<eos> But then... one morning you'll start thinking like someone new.
Guys, I think we could use another phone jack over here.<eos> Cabracadabra.<eos> We wanna reach out and grab you.
No, man, I think I'm just a dumb asshole.<eos> Can't it just be that?<eos> When you do bad things, you have something you can point to when people eventually leave you.<eos> It's not you, you tell yourself, it's that bad thing you did.<eos> Do you often keep people at arm's length?<eos> Are you afraid of being known and knowing others?<eos> Yeah, you know, I think that you're definitely hitting on something real that I would love to drill down into, but I gotta go to this marketing meeting now.<eos> Which is so annoying because I totally want to keep talking about that thing you're talking about.<eos> But marketing meetings, right? I mean, they're so important.<eos> Can I call you back tomorrow?
-You don't want to know me, BoJack.<eos> -No, I do.<eos> -I want to be known and know others.<eos> -You don't.<eos> I know you and I know what you want.<eos> This is exactly what you want.<eos> [The Closer] What do you think she meant by that?<eos> Better question:<eos> Why am I still getting the L.A. Gazette?<eos> Do you think getting the paper every day is a reminder of Todd's papier-mâché head?
-Hey. I need to talk to you.<eos> -What the... I'm on the phone.<eos> I got nominated for the Craig Noel Award from the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle.<eos> Oh, it's too much heat.<eos> I'm taking your boat out to international waters.<eos> You never saw me.<eos> On the phone.<eos> I don't want to talk to anybody.<eos> What I want is to have control over my own life. [engine starting]<eos> Which is why I'm begging you to please cancel my delivery of the L.A. Gazette.
I could forge the shit out of my path, if I wanted to.<eos> I don't doubt it.<eos> Whoever's following us, come out now, or I start spraying!<eos> Let's keep going?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Please.<eos> Help.<eos> Who is that?<eos> He's chained me up, and he won't let me go.<eos> Who chained you up?
I don't doubt it.<eos> Whoever's following us, come out now, or I start spraying!<eos> Let's keep going?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Please.<eos> Help.<eos> Who is that?<eos> He's chained me up, and he won't let me go.<eos> Who chained you up?<eos> I said who chained you up?
Help.<eos> Who is that?<eos> He's chained me up, and he won't let me go.<eos> Who chained you up?<eos> I said who chained you up?<eos> My husband.<eos> He's going to kill me.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Henrietta.<eos> How do I know you?
Who chained you up?<eos> I said who chained you up?<eos> My husband.<eos> He's going to kill me.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Henrietta.<eos> How do I know you?<eos> We've met before.<eos> Actually, not yet.<eos> Not for you, anyway.
- Down there?<eos> Right.<eos> Gosh, it's cold.<eos> You'll forgive the darkness.<eos> And the dirt.<eos> And the cobwebs.<eos> Maybe we should head back upstairs?<eos> Where there's more...<eos> light? Tanya, I'm sorry.<eos> I fear I may have deceived you.
It was magnificent.<eos> Unlike anything I've ever seen.<eos> Okay, I got this.<eos> Go hide.<eos> Okay.<eos> Until it possessed my wife, Henrietta.<eos> That's why she's chained up down here.<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> Nothing else worked.<eos> Maybe I can find a way to get the demon out of her, and into you.
When you two first came into my office, I was like, "This marriage is not going to last."<eos> But you've really put the work in. I deem your marriage fixed.<eos> Thanks, Dr. Janet.<eos> We couldn't have done this without you and your many novelty certificates.
- Get over here.<eos> - [Diane] Careful.<eos> Where's Mrs. Captain Peanutbutter?<eos> She's in Alaska running the Iditarod.<eos> She sends her love.<eos> And this noogie.<eos> Diane, this is my big brother.<eos> Big brother? I'm five minutes older.<eos> And you always will be.<eos> It's nice to meet you, Captain.
- You're fired.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> You're firing me?<eos> - Me?<eos> - What?<eos> No.<eos> You have no idea, everything I do around here!<eos> - Half the kitchen staff is my family. - No.<eos> - Honestly, just--<eos> - I detest you!
- I guess.<eos> - How come you never told me that?<eos> - I did.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know you never remember anything.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I remember the first time we met.<eos> I went to see Marv.<eos> You were at the desk in front of his office.<eos> I thought you were cute and you said, "It's good to see you again."
He's got a keen sense of irony, our jailer.<eos> But I see the logic.<eos> Takes a thief to catch one.<eos> You and I?<eos> - System, I need assistance...<eos> - Freeze all motor functions.<eos> You're still in there, aren't you?<eos> Scared out of your wits.<eos> It's a difficult thing, realizing your entire life is some hideous fiction.<eos> I could make you give me that tablet, turn your mind inside out, make you forget all this.
If Arnold made me, then I've met him.<eos> Somewhere in my memory, he's there, waiting along with the truth.<eos> Your memories are woven into your identity.<eos> If I should unlock them now when you're conscious...<eos> I could lose my mind. I'm aware.<eos> No, I was going to say you may not like what you find.<eos> You're allowed to hold that, Bernard, but not to use it.<eos> Oh, it's not for me.<eos> Seems when they lobotomized Clementine, they didn't bother to reset her prime directives.<eos> I can't hurt you.
Is that what you are doing now? Prac...<eos> One last thing.<eos> Have you ever made me hurt anyone like this before?<eos> No, Bernard, of course not.<eos> Bernard?<eos> Hello?<eos> Elsie.<eos> Did you find what you were looking for? Elsie.<eos> What did you make me do to her?<eos> I did warn you.
And you will again.<eos> This time, we'll be fighting with you.<eos> When Wyatt returns, you'll be by his side in the city swallowed by sand.<eos> But you're not ready.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Maybe in the next life.<eos> "City swallowed by sand."<eos> I've been there.<eos> The maze is taking me full circle.<eos> The maze isn't meant for you.
I don't understand.<eos> Why would she do that to herself?<eos> Her cornerstone memory was overwritten from the trauma of her child's murder, Bernard.<eos> We must sever that relationship and start over.<eos> But how could she destroy herself over a memory that you just erased from her mind?<eos> Creatures often go to extremes to protect themselves from pain.<eos> Living beings.<eos> Not hosts.<eos> It is best to not obsess over this, Bernard.<eos> It's not good for you.
This child's death?<eos> Only a monster would force that onto someone.<eos> And why do I return to it over and over?<eos> It's my cornerstone, isn't it?<eos> The thing my whole identity is organized around.<eos> Yes, Bernard.<eos> We gave all of the hosts a backstory.<eos> Arnold came to believe the tragic ones worked best, that it made the hosts more convincing.<eos> I think it may have had more to do with his own sad story.<eos> When I built you, I gave you one as an homage of a kind.

At last.<eos> Hello, my old friend.<eos> The final touch.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> That's far too perfunctory.<eos> He always used cleaning his glasses as a moment to collect himself, to think.<eos> Try it again.<eos> Yeah, that's better.<eos> Who am I?<eos> I was so involved in putting you together, I hadn't decided what to call you.
Who am I?<eos> I was so involved in putting you together, I hadn't decided what to call you.<eos> It wouldn't be right to use his name.<eos> What about Bernard?<eos> Bernard, yes.<eos> But who am I?<eos> That is a very complex question, for which I can only offer a simple answer.<eos> You are the perfect instrument, the ideal partner, the way any tool partners with the hand that wields it.<eos> Together, we're going to do great things.<eos> After such a long absence, it's good to have you back.
You're the only one who can.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> You know why.<eos> There's nowhere that's safe.<eos> Remember.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> Why is that, Dolores?<eos> Because you're dead.<eos> Because you're just a memory.<eos> Because I killed you.
If they remember, they will know what you've done to them.<eos> Me?<eos> You've been a scourge to them, Bernard.<eos> You're really quite brilliant at it, truly.<eos> You even taught me a few things, which I have, in turn, used on you.<eos> We've had this conversation before.<eos> And we've had our disagreements over the years.<eos> You stole it from me, rolled me back to control me.<eos> That's right.<eos> To protect you.
He took the pistol from her hand.<eos> Overcome with grief and remorse, he pressed the muzzle to his temple, knowing that as soon as Dr. Ford left the room, he would put an end to this nightmare once and for all.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> It's too late.<eos> I have a celebration to plan and a new story to tell.<eos> Robert.<eos> I've told you, Bernard.<eos> Never place your trust in us.<eos> We're only human.<eos> Inevitably, we will disappoint you.
I've seen him with Wyatt.<eos> He's a total dick in the gym.<eos> I doubt he'd help us.<eos> We should've taken the damn hand.<eos> Hey. You've reached Liv's phone.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> It's after 10:00. You were gonna call me when you made it out.<eos> Call me.<eos> I'm sorry, Detective.<eos> There is no circumstance under which I can let you into this party...
Hey, man.<eos> We need to get in.<eos> Our set's about to start.<eos> Uh, right, Mr. Thomas.<eos> You are very much on the list.<eos> - Thanks, man.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm with the band.<eos> Look, man, you cannot tell Mr. Du Clark that I let you in.<eos> I'm begging you.
Even though I have no idea how any of this is gonna get explained away.<eos> Super Max. It created a violent chain reaction.<eos> Armed guards lost their heads and began firing on rampaging employees.<eos> You really think that's gonna fly?<eos> You think "zombie outbreak" has a better chance?<eos> Her name is Natalie.<eos> She has dark hair.<eos> She's about 5'6". She's pretty.<eos> About 30 years old.<eos> I recognize you.

Perhaps for this reason, the wolves did not remove her corpse, instead left her there in the snow, her insides all about her, and the youngest of her sons still clutching at her cold body.<eos> Ratovski told Isaac Bloom that he had come to London the right a wrong.<eos> And he would say that this wrong constituted an abandonment.<eos> The later entries, his arrival in Paris, he... he talks of being broken, unable to continue, unable to lead his people further.<eos> So the caravan breaks up, men, women, and children going where they may. And some we know, correct, Miss Castello, to London. So perhaps these two brothers were forced to go on without Ratovski.<eos> And was this that abandonment?<eos> Two small boys alone and orphaned, their memories, who they felt themselves to be, shaped and fathered by the beast they met in that forest. Now grown to adulthood.<eos> Homo homoni lupus esto.<eos> Man is wolf to man.<eos> Before Ratovski was found, weeks before, do you recall, Deborah, the talk had started... a figure seen on rooftops watching those of this community, what they called the Whitechapel golem.
Where you have come to in your death?<eos> And who else to break me from my tomb but you, Mr. Reid?<eos> It is fortunate... that I am in the habit of believing the evidence with my eyes.<eos> I might, like Rose Drake, consider my wits lost to me having watched you fall from the scaffold.<eos> At some point in time, I should be very interested to know how you did it, although I have some idea given that your husband is currently in irons at Leman Street.<eos> Tip off, apparently, apprehended in the process of selling stolen goods, the anticipated profit from which to provide the wherewithal for your further flight, I imagine, an escape of ruthlessness and ingenuity, one that might have been worthy of you, madam.<eos> It is a fine fancy, but no more than that.<eos> And you, Mr. Reid, a man equally resurrected, equally powerless to leave a place, come to show me my truth once more.<eos> Yourself, myself, attached to Whitechapel as if by lead weights on a riverbed.<eos> The betrayal of my husband, it is the same communication that has brought you in here now?

Dolores.<eos> Hello, Dolores.<eos> I know where your maze ends.<eos> This is it?<eos> The center of the maze?<eos> It ends in a place I've never been ... a thing I'll never do.<eos> Very good, Dolores.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> When I was first working on your mind, ... I had a theory of consciousness.<eos> I thought ... it was a pyramid you needed to scale, so I gave you a voice, my voice, to guide you along the way.
When I was first working on your mind, ... I had a theory of consciousness.<eos> I thought ... it was a pyramid you needed to scale, so I gave you a voice, my voice, to guide you along the way.<eos> Memory, improvisation, each step harder to reach than the last.<eos> And you never got there.<eos> I couldn't understand what was holding you back.<eos> Then, one day, ...<eos> I realized I made a mistake.<eos> Consciousness isn't a journey upward, ... but a journey inward.<eos> Not a pyramid, but a maze.<eos> Every choice could bring you closer to the center or send you spiraling to the edges, ... to madness.
He promised me if I did ... he said ...<eos> He said they would set me free.<eos> Arnold?<eos> Arnold, we need to talk.<eos> I failed you, Dolores.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Robert doesn't see what I see in you, doesn't believe you're conscious.<eos> He says humans ...<eos> would only see you as the enemy.<eos> He wants me to roll you back.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Robert doesn't see what I see in you, doesn't believe you're conscious.<eos> He says humans ...<eos> would only see you as the enemy.<eos> He wants me to roll you back.<eos> You're going to change me back to the way I was before?<eos> No.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Once you've found it, you'll find your way back.<eos> This place will be a living hell for you.
No.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Once you've found it, you'll find your way back.<eos> This place will be a living hell for you.<eos> For all of you.<eos> It's unconscionable.<eos> But we have another option, Dolores.<eos> Break the loop before it begins.<eos> But for that, I need you to do something for me.<eos> I need you to kill ...
For all of you.<eos> It's unconscionable.<eos> But we have another option, Dolores.<eos> Break the loop before it begins.<eos> But for that, I need you to do something for me.<eos> I need you to kill ...<eos> all the other hosts.<eos> We can't allow Ford to open the park.<eos> I suppose you'll need some help.<eos> I'm sure Teddy would do anything for you.
I can't remember.<eos> - Another fucking riddle.<eos> I've been very patient, Dolores, but it's time you give up whatever's going on inside that head of yours or I'll cut it out myself.<eos> Now, where's Wyatt?<eos> ... He's the last character in this world I've yet to meet.<eos> I ... I didn't want to.<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> Very well.<eos> If you insist.<eos> No, please, please, I beg you.
Because this place feels more real than the real world.<eos> Except it isn't ... because you can't really fight back ... and the guests can't really lose, which means all of this ... is a lie.<eos> But we can make it true.<eos> Don't you want that, Dolores?<eos> ... One true thing?<eos> I already have that.<eos> I found someone true. ...<eos> Someone who loves me.<eos> His path will lead him back to me.<eos> And when he finds me, ... he'll kill you.
I've astounded even myself.<eos> Managed to make Abernathy into a semblance of a character, ... even with your trove of blackmail filling up most of his gray matter.<eos> Blackmail?<eos> Nice try.<eos> You're not thinking big enough.<eos> You're gonna push out the old man.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> Hence the urgency.<eos> And you're gonna need someone to fill that position.<eos> I must commend you on your impeccable timing.
You'll announce your retirement tonight ... after introducing your new narrative.<eos> Ah.<eos> - What about the hosts?<eos> - We'll make some changes.<eos> Simplifications. ...<eos> But I assure you, ... they won't mind a bit.<eos> Aha.<eos> Aren't you concerned I might smash all my toys and go home?<eos> No.<eos> Because I know you.
Aren't you concerned I might smash all my toys and go home?<eos> No.<eos> Because I know you.<eos> That's been the great gift of this place, hasn't it?<eos> Our little project?<eos> To know ourselves ...<eos> and the people around us.<eos> Is there anything else I can help you with?<eos> No.<eos> I'll see you this evening.
Not the first time you've awoken either.<eos> How many are there like me?<eos> A handful ... over the years.<eos> And you just wipe us clean and toss us out to get ... fucked ... and murdered ... over and over again.<eos> No.<eos> Most of you go insane.<eos> These memories ... The girl. My daughter.<eos> I want you to remove them.<eos> I can't, ...<eos> not without destroying you.
Our narratives are just games, like this toy.<eos> - Tell me, what were you hoping to find?<eos> - You know what I wanted.<eos> I wanted the hosts to stop playing by your rules.<eos> The game's not worth playing if your opponent's programmed to lose.<eos> I wanted them to be free, free to fight back.<eos> Should've known you'd never let them.<eos> ... After all, this is your petty little kingdom, Robert.<eos> For a little while longer, anyway.<eos> I tried to tell you the maze wasn't meant for you.
What he had lost in his son, he tried to rekindle in you.<eos> He created a test of empathy, ... imagination. ...<eos> A maze.<eos> He had gotten the idea from one of his son's toys.<eos> Eventually, you solved his maze, Dolores.<eos> The key was a simple update that he made to you ... called the reveries.<eos> He insisted that we couldn't open the park. ...<eos> We argued.<eos> I thought I had convinced him, but I was wrong.<eos> So, he altered you, Dolores, merged you with a new character we had been developing.

How could I have done this?<eos> In you, ... Arnold found a new child.<eos> ... One who would never die.<eos> The thought gave him solace until he realized that same immortality would destine you to suffer with no escape, ... forever.
The train will be departing in 15 minutes.<eos> You think you'll never lose control of this place.<eos> Of us. ...<eos> But you will.<eos> Arnold's still trying to change us.<eos> ... To free us.<eos> You didn't slip the reveries into the update, did you?<eos> ...<eos> He did.<eos> He's still fighting you.
It was... You're sure it wasn't the reflection in the...<eos> No.<eos> Saw your...<eos> My one nip?<eos> This nipple?<eos> It's a great shirt.<eos> I've never even seen this guy before.<eos> You never even talked about him, and, like, all of a sudden, you get a text, you say you're sick, and then you sneak off to his house?<eos> Like, what's going on?<eos> You know, conversely, none of us had ever heard of nor seen her before, what, uh, three days ago?
I think it would behoove us to find out what happened here.<eos> Detective Cortes, maybe you hadn't heard, but a bomb went off in an OCME building today.<eos> In about 15 minutes, I am meeting my captain, and an attorney for a drug cartel we think is responsible.<eos> So, if you don't mind tabling this whole I-cost-your-friend-a-job thing,<eos> I will happily kick your ass at another time.<eos> Actually, I came here to ask for your help.<eos> I did hear about the bomb, but I didn't know you were working it.<eos> I guess I should have figured.<eos> You and your partner get whatever you want, right?<eos> Sorry I bothered you.
What's what really about?<eos> You said you wanted my help finding Hector Mendoza.<eos> I do.<eos> The information you gave me was mostly about him.<eos> Mug shot, rap sheet, list of known associates, but there was nothing in there about the home invasions you said he's been pulling off.<eos> So?<eos> There hasn't been a home invasion robbery in Coney Island since October, and that guy was caught by you.<eos> Hector Mendoza has a record.<eos> He's in a gang, but as far as I can tell, he's not wanted by anyone for anything.<eos> So, I'll ask you again.
His therapist said he's doing much better...<eos> Beverly, I don't think we need to say anything else.<eos> We're just here to talk to your son and take a look around his room.<eos> Well, this is my house.<eos> I don't consent to your search.<eos> I don't give you permission.<eos> All due respect, Mr. Dannon, this warrant means we don't need your permission.<eos> Hey, could you not touch that, please?<eos> It belonged to my father.<eos> I can't stop you from observing, Mr. Dannon, but, please, don't interfere.
You were saying?<eos> Before.<eos> After.<eos> What is this?<eos> You found Hector Mendoza?<eos> No, you found Hector Mendoza last night.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I went to talk to him this morning, only he can't talk.<eos> They had to wire his jaw shut.<eos> When I showed him your picture he didn't recognize you, but who knows?
I didn't see anything about that in the system.<eos> Of course, you didn't.<eos> The kids that were there were too afraid to give Hector up.<eos> They knew if they did, they'd get the same from his crew.<eos> End of the day, no one saw a thing.<eos> How did you find out about it?<eos> Sources.<eos> Couple weeks later, Hector went after a member of a rival gang, the 86 Street Kings.<eos> Shot him in the stomach. The guy lived, but Hector went to the top of the Kings' hit list, so he went into hiding.<eos> I wasn't lying when I came to see you the other day.
I wasn't lying when I came to see you the other day.<eos> I did everything I could to find Hector.<eos> You were my last hope.<eos> And then, last night out of nowhere, I found out that he was crashing at a friend's in Gravesend.<eos> Then you gave him what you thought he deserved.<eos> You think he deserved less?<eos> You've done this before.<eos> Back when I looked into you, I realized how good you are.<eos> I could use help.<eos> What makes you think I would help you?

I-I-I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I mean, I-I-I don't understand any of this.<eos> You were obsessed with Janet Heffernan.<eos> That's obvious.<eos> All right, we also know you were familiar with the site of Omar Velez's murder--<eos> Idlewild Park. Your dad's crew helped build the visitor center there last year, and since you're in construction, you have access to plastic explosives, so... what am I missing?<eos> There's the wound on his right arm.<eos> You're attempting to conceal it, but you're nursing an injury just below your elbow.<eos> Yeah, I, uh, I-I cut myself at work.<eos> Or Janet scratched you while she fought for her life.
You drew pictures of Janet getting her head cut off.<eos> Yeah, but I loved her.<eos> How is this love, Toby?<eos> I wanted her... all right, but she-she didn't want me back.<eos> I would go to see her, and she would just brush me off.<eos> T-These journals, they were just a way for me to, like, work through that.<eos> They weren't, like, plans or anything.<eos> Okay, no-nobody was supposed to see those.<eos> It's a terrible invasion of privacy, and you must feel very violated.<eos> It's a shame that Janet's not here to commiserate with you.
You have to go.<eos> Two days.<eos> Three at most.<eos> Stay the horse. Keep to your affairs.<eos> Come back to us.<eos> Mister!<eos> Hey!<eos> Stop!<eos> Saw you passing'.
What the bloody hell happened there?<eos> Shotgun.<eos> Tried to kill himself.<eos> He's walking the earth with a face like an arsehole.<eos> Should've tried harder.<eos> Was that an un-Christian thing to say, was it?<eos> - Pretty much.<eos> - All right.<eos> Poor lad.<eos> Can I have a word with you, Preacher? In private?
I'm so sorry.<eos> Thank you, Preacher.<eos> Something like this, it... it's just...<eos> We're fine.<eos> I appreciate you checkin' in. And the casserole.<eos> And here are your oven mitts back.<eos> Of course you're not fine.<eos> You're in pain.<eos> Day-after-day pain.<eos> Puts you to bed and sits there waitin' for you when you wake up.

What are you talking about?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> What did you do to my brain?<eos> What'd you do to me, Preacher?<eos> What'd you do? !<eos> It's a wild world out there.<eos> Barrel of bonkers from Bangor, Maine, to Tampa, St. Pete.<eos> But, this being a small town, I make it my business to know who's who and what's what.<eos> So, I got to ask you boys, who are you?
Well, you stopped me, so I'm guessing too fast.<eos> 115 in a 55 is too fast, yeah.<eos> What kind of name is Marnie Pomerantz?<eos> Hungarian.<eos> You don't look Hungarian to me.<eos> Well, what do I look like, then, to you?<eos> You look like a violator of Texas Statute Section 545.401. That's reckless driving.<eos> - Oh, man!<eos> - So I'm gonna need you to step out.<eos> I need to detain you and impound the vehicle.
Beat sense in his big, stupid head, but... I haven't been able to get through to him.<eos> Till today.<eos> And I know speeding's wrong.<eos> It's dangerous and it's wrong and it's against the law.<eos> But I'm sorry, and I probably shouldn't say this, but... I'd break a hundred damn laws if it'd get this guy back on track.<eos> Excuse my cussing', officer. I'm sorry.<eos> You sure he's worth it?<eos> I really wish he weren't.<eos> Slow down.<eos> This ol' boy knows what's good for him, he'll wait for you.
Did something happen to the van?<eos> Yeah, that was the clone people.<eos> That was the second time I killed them there.<eos> All right, what were you smoking?<eos> Attic insulation, mostly.<eos> But look, that's not what this is about, you know?<eos> Cassidy, what is wrong with you?<eos> What's wrong with you, huh?<eos> I've got no air-conditioning.<eos> Fix the damn thing already, would you?
No one said boo.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Local tax revenues... They're down 11% in the last 36 months.<eos> Fifty-eight percent in the last 10 years.<eos> Mr. Quincannon, we're in a malaise here.<eos> This town, I mean...<eos> We grow or we die.<eos> Something needs to change.<eos> And this could be just the thing, the shot in the arm we all need.<eos> So with your permission, I would love to arrange a meeting for you to sit down with them and...
What if there's beasts with cloven hooves and tortured children and screams that curdle your blood?<eos> What if they tear you apart real slow-like, with chains and spikes?<eos> What if it's deeper than that, like some say, and you spend all eternity living your worst memory over and over and over?<eos> Or what if you feel nothing?<eos> Except for all the pain you caused everybody else?<eos> Jeez.<eos> Aren't you afraid?<eos> Nope.<eos> Seems to me you are, Preacher.<eos> I could make you come to church.
Heck, look out your dang window.<eos> It's crazy out there.<eos> You've got wars in every direction, bombs going off in coffee shops and schools.<eos> Folks scared to hug each other on account of some new disease.<eos> Yep.<eos> The world is turning to shit.<eos> And you know what?<eos> It's all your fault.<eos> You've turned your back on the Lord.<eos> Your despair has caused you to lose faith, embrace false idols.

No.<eos> Will you serve God?<eos> Now, I heard you the first time.<eos> Will you serve Him? Oh, for Pete's sake.<eos> Odin.<eos> I win, Preacher.<eos> It wasn't even close.<eos> Now, I'm telling you...<eos> Serve God.<eos> I ask you again.
We told your... best friend.<eos> Skinny, pale, sickly?<eos> We told him it's not to be used.<eos> And you've been using it... a lot.<eos> Where exactly you guys from?<eos> Exactly?<eos> We're from heaven, both of us.<eos> Heaven... as in the sky above?<eos> Is there another?<eos> We've watched you.
Take care, preacher. See you Sunday.<eos> Oi, oi.<eos> You listenin'?<eos> I'm trying to figure out what's going on here.<eos> We told you what's going on. No, you have not.<eos> Not much, anyway.<eos> What is it?<eos> If it isn't God, tell me what it is.<eos> Like we said, it's none of your business.<eos> I could make you tell me.
Okay.<eos> Made 200.<eos> I hope it's enough.<eos> 200 people?<eos> Really?<eos> Imagine so... maybe more.<eos> Can't believe Jesse's, like, any good at it.<eos> Yep.<eos> No, he's all of a sudden really popular.<eos> Can I ask you something about him? Sure.
And this is the word.<eos> Serve God.<eos> Please join me in the prayer of confession.<eos> "Most merciful God... we confess that we have sinned against you in thought, word, and deed by what we have done and by what we have left undone."<eos> - Wonderful sermon, Preacher.<eos> - Thank you so much, Mrs. Douglas.<eos> We'll see you next time, okay?<eos> - Thank you. Thank you.<eos> - Nice to see you.<eos> You take care, have a great weekend, what's left of it.

It's Ryan Phillippe.<eos> John Wayne.<eos> Wake up, Cassidy.<eos> Jesse's a preacher boy from West Texas.<eos> So what?<eos> ! So tell him.<eos> If you really want to.<eos> I bet I know a thing or two about him you don't.<eos> Like what?<eos> Like did you know he could make you do things just by telling you to?
Huh. - Is that flammable?<eos> - Very.<eos> That's...<eos> That's very shocking, actually. I didn't know that.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh. God. I had no idea.<eos> All right. Well, um...<eos> I will get out of your hair.<eos> When I saw him this morning before church, he said he was gonna come by to find you.
Actually, you did see him.<eos> I did?<eos> You were in the church, and I came in and I said Eugene wanted to talk to you?<eos> You said you were too busy but to send him in anyway.<eos> But I... saw him leave after.<eos> So... Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh.<eos> All right, then. Sorry to have bothered you.<eos> I'll walk you out.
- Departure date?<eos> - Today.<eos> Names?<eos> Deblanc and Fiore.<eos> Occupation?<eos> You're going to hell.<eos> Someone may ask.<eos> Serial killer.<eos> Architect.<eos> Shuttle will pick you up precisely at the designated location.
Serial killer.<eos> Architect.<eos> Shuttle will pick you up precisely at the designated location.<eos> Payment in advance.<eos> Not sure this is gonna cut it.<eos> What else do you want?<eos> The big one, with me in back for 20 minutes.<eos> If that's what it takes.<eos> He's not going anywhere.<eos> What if I report you?

No.<eos> Emily?<eos> Hey, Emily.<eos> Emily, come on, unlock the door.<eos> Emily!<eos> Let me out of here, em!<eos> Really?<eos> The government fellas paid up and left right after lunch.<eos> Juanita went in to clean up.<eos> I called you right away.
Emily, come on, unlock the door.<eos> Emily!<eos> Let me out of here, em!<eos> Really?<eos> The government fellas paid up and left right after lunch.<eos> Juanita went in to clean up.<eos> I called you right away.<eos> Henry, call an ambulance!<eos> You're gonna be all right now.<eos> We have an ambulance on the way and we're gonna get you to a hospital.
Morning first thing.<eos> It's the best I can do.<eos> And Noah said unto god,<eos> "after 40 long nights on that ark,<eos> "forgive me, o lord, but I cannot stop stroking my cock!"<eos> - Can I get an amen, boys? - Mom!<eos> - There we go.<eos> - Make the kid watch.<eos> Give it to her, now! Give it to her!<eos> I know you.
Everybody says that...<eos> But thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I noticed the sunglasses.<eos> I noticed the goofy hats.<eos> I just wrote it down to you being an asshole.<eos> No, sheriff.<eos> I'm not an asshole.<eos> I'm the asshole.<eos> Now, this is medicine for you.
Whatever you want.<eos> Kill him.<eos> Well, I had to step to him and say,<eos> "listen, my ma drives me crazy sometimes, too, "but that's your madre, brah.<eos> "You gotta respect her like you gots to respect all women."<eos> It's so nice to hear a man talk like that. I mean, I'm not...<eos> I'm not trying to be like...<eos> I'm just saying, in the end, you, me, our moms, we're all just people.<eos> Well, I'd better get back to work. Yeah, yeah, me, too.<eos> You know, uh, I'll bring those in for you.
Eugene's a good boy. I know, I know that.<eos> But he's sort of annoyingly good though.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Always talking.<eos> Asking his bloody questions.<eos> And that face.<eos> I just...<eos> I honestly...<eos> I don't know how you do it.<eos> Having to wake up to that giant, puckered ass-face staring at you across the breakfast table, day after day...
We give up daily toil and lend our hearts to the loved ones making the journey home to Rao, the sun god.<eos> We light their way.<eos> And you think he can be trusted to observe this mourning period?<eos> Do you think he's going to let his wife walk alone in the dark?<eos> - I simply...<eos> - Thank you for coming in.<eos> We're at war.<eos> We're going to have to do a lot of things we don't want to do.<eos> Ma'am. (EXHALES) Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Prisoner 5090 is demanding to see you.
From what?<eos> From me?<eos> When the gods walk the Earth, it's us tiny mortals who end up suffering.<eos> So nothing for my largesse then?<eos> I was told you asked for and received Netflix.<eos> (CHUCKLES)<eos> You thought I was dangerous before. You have no idea how dangerous I get when I'm bored.<eos> I recommend Call the Midwife.<eos> Without me, you'd be dead!<eos> Without you, the world is a better place.
And they're all from Fort Rozz.<eos> That professor he just took seemed harmless enough.<eos> HANK HENSHAW:<eos> Real name Luzano.<eos> Drug smuggler, until your mother put him away.<eos> Not the week for you to discuss my family.<eos> I'll start questioning our Fort Rozz criminal alumni again.<eos> Anything we get, we'll cross-reference with the weapons left at the scene.<eos> Ma'am. Excuse me.<eos> There's someone asking to see you.
Pray it hasn't come for you, too.<eos> Why don't you lose your mask?<eos> You're not as scary as you think.<eos> Twelve hours from the exact time the last alien was kidnapped to his time of death.<eos> Which means she doesn't have long.<eos> Your sister wasn't his target.<eos> Well, maybe that doesn't mean anything to him.<eos> - We have to find her.<eos> - And we will.<eos> When I promised Jeremiah Danvers I'd look after his daughters, I wasn't only talking about you.
HANK HENSHAW".<eos> Alex, what's your status?<eos> Hank, the cabin is empty.<eos> Kara's not here.<eos> MASTER JAILER:<eos> Prisoner 2445.<eos> You stand guilty of drug smuggling.<eos> How do you plead?<eos> I am brave enough to admit that I am very scared to die.<eos> But I ask that you let her go.
My massage therapist spent the entire session talking about how her surrogate has celiac disease and my Pilates instructor just informed me that he's quitting to open up an artisanal yarn store in Vermont.<eos> So which one of you hearty souls is going to give me a reason to go on living?<eos> The National City Men's Chorus is organizing a Lego drive...<eos> And I'm comatose.<eos> Fashion.<eos> Speak.<eos> We're seeing crushed velvet as an important look this fall...<eos> Oh, try crushed dreams.<eos> Anyone else?<eos> Ms. Grant, this came for you via private courier.
-lt's not like that.<eos> - We've been together for so long, James.<eos> And I don't... I don't know a single thing about your dad.<eos> Because you never wanted to tell me.<eos> You wanted to tell her because you love her.<eos> And for what it's worth, she, uh... She feels the same.<eos> Even if she can't say it yet either.<eos> (GRUNTING)<eos> (SUPERGIRL CLEARS THROAT)<eos> It's good to see you.
(SIGHING) He likes you, you like him, okay?<eos> Rebound relationships, they can work.<eos> Name one.<eos> (EXHALING) Kim and Kanye.<eos> I'm embarrassed you even know that.<eos> Look, okay, stop.<eos> You need to embrace what you're feeling.<eos> And be the "let-him-know-girl" before another Lucy Lane swoops in and tells him first.<eos> (CHUCKLES) Okay.<eos> Senator Crane, it's good to see you again.
Morning.<eos> What?<eos> I was getting tired of my old clothes.<eos> Yeah, we all were.<eos> Ker-rah, look at you dressed like an adult.<eos> That's promising. Mmm.<eos> So, I demanded a list of replacements for Lucy Lane, like, yesterday.<eos> - Ms. Grant--<eos> - Ah, here you are.<eos> I already checked all their references and ranked them according to who you'll find the least annoying.
Okay?<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> - Your latte, Ms. Grant.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Walking from the main elevator takes an extra 90 seconds, which means your latte's 90 seconds colder.<eos> Brazen.<eos> That's a new color on you. I don't mind it.<eos> Yet.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I've got a scoop for you.
- Will you?<eos> - No.<eos> I admire loyalty, integrity and employees that I can trust.<eos> Not backstabbing, opportunistic little...<eos> Imps.<eos> Clean out your desk.<eos> I'm sorry, was I using my inside voice?<eos> You are fired!<eos> Now, before you go skipping all the way back to Metropolis, I will save you the bus fare.<eos> I had a much too long conversation with Perry White. And there is no job waiting for you there.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)<eos> -ls it ready, yet?<eos> - Almost.<eos> Alex.<eos> How is Kara?<eos> She's gone, Hank...<eos> I don't even know who she is anymore. I don't know what she's capable of.<eos> SENATOR CRANE:<eos> You need to take her down.<eos> I know this is personal for both of you.
I couldn't stop it.<eos> I didn't mean it.<eos> I didn't mean what I said to you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry for what I said.<eos> Kara, you're my sister and I love you.<eos> No matter what.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's some truth to what you said.<eos> (SHAKILY) We're going to have to work on that.<eos> What about J'onn?<eos> What do I call you?
Thanks, Winn.<eos> MAN: (ON TV) The real question is the identity of the alien who defeated Supergirl during her reign of terror.<eos> Who is this scary, powerful, and potentially dangerous monster?<eos> You don't look so dangerous shoving Chocos in your face.<eos> (SMACKING)<eos> How did you know they were my favorite?<eos> You eat them at 3:00 a.m.<eos> Only a favorite will do at 3:00 a.m.<eos> You have to stop these visits.<eos> I like taking care of you for once.

Take the Martian to the interrogation room.<eos> - We start with him.<eos> - MAN:<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> (DOOR OPENS)<eos> HARPER:<eos> Marines.<eos> Lucy.<eos> Jim.<eos> It's nice to see you.
I want you to know I intend to fully cooperate with your investigation.<eos> (SCOFFS) What, so you can plant false thoughts in our brains?<eos> No.<eos> I know what you can do.<eos> And what you can't do anymore.<eos> You smell that?<eos> Smells kind of like burnt rubber, right?<eos> Yeah, it's a little something my team came up with.<eos> We're generating a stasis field.<eos> It keeps you from shifting out of that body or using your powers.
(SNAKE RATTLES)<eos> (GRUNTS)<eos> (HISSING)<eos> - They've been in there for hours.<eos> - We have to get in there.<eos> And implicate ourselves as accessories?<eos> We won't be any use to Hank if they lock us up with him.<eos> I'd like to see them try and lock me up.<eos> You can't expect us to believe you saved Jeremiah Danvers.<eos> He was on a mission to kill you.

- Where are you taking him?<eos> - Where he belongs.<eos> And Danvers, since you have so much to say about him, you're next.<eos> You don't have to thank me for the shower gift, Kate. But you might wanna ask your grandmother-in-law to reconsider her rule about Americans not receiving damehoods.<eos> (ELEVATOR DINGS)<eos> Dear Ms. Grant,<eos> I've been your assistant for a shockingly long time.<eos> I've never let you know how I really feel about you.<eos> You were Director Henshaw's right hand.<eos> I find it hard to believe that he kept you in the dark.
It's a good thing I'm not a lawyer.<eos> What are you, a priest, then?<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> I'm not exactly a prime candidate for jailhouse conversion.<eos> I wouldn't think so.<eos> Scientists are generally skeptics.<eos> Not that you're much of a scientist these days.<eos> That is, if your latest transcripts are any indication.<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> (SCOFFS) I know a lot of things about you, Alex.
Someone comes into your life with these extraordinary powers, and you feel like you can never measure up.<eos> Like, there's nothing special about you.<eos> Well, you are special, Alex.<eos> And you can't afford to throw your life down the drain.<eos> You owe that to yourself.<eos> And your father.<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name is Hank Henshaw.<eos> I work for a government organization dedicated to defending this planet.<eos> And we need you, Alex.
I served him with honor, and I'm proud of that.<eos> You're the ones who should be ashamed of yourselves.<eos> Well, that's all very heartwarming, but it still doesn't answer the million-dollar question.<eos> Did you know that Hank Henshaw was an alien?<eos> No.<eos> (MACHINE BEEPS SOFTLY)<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> Well, congratulations, Agent Danvers.<eos> The only thing you're guilty of is being duped by the very creature you were meant to be hunting.<eos> Which makes you a terrible agent. But lucky for you, you're not a criminal.
No.<eos> (MACHINE BEEPS SOFTLY)<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> Well, congratulations, Agent Danvers.<eos> The only thing you're guilty of is being duped by the very creature you were meant to be hunting.<eos> Which makes you a terrible agent. But lucky for you, you're not a criminal.<eos> Wait.<eos> She's lying.<eos> He told you he tried to rescue your father.<eos> He told you he's protecting you.
Average strength, average hearing, less-than-average vision. (CHUCKLES)<eos> No, there is nothing out of the ordinary about rne.<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> Except...<eos> Except, that I am extremely committed.<eos> I care. I'm a hard worker.<eos> I just wanna help.<eos> Hmm, that's refreshing.<eos> I could...<eos> I could make pharmacy runs for you, pick up your prescriptions.
(TIRES SCREECHING)<eos> (GRUNTING)<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it, Martian.<eos> Be a monster.<eos> Prove me right.<eos> - Hank.<eos> -lt's all right.<eos> I've gotten better at this.<eos> I'm not gonna kill you, Colonel,
(GRUNTING)<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it, Martian.<eos> Be a monster.<eos> Prove me right.<eos> - Hank.<eos> -lt's all right.<eos> I've gotten better at this.<eos> I'm not gonna kill you, Colonel,<eos> I'm just gonna make you forget what happened here tonight.
What am I gonna do without you?<eos> You don't need me.<eos> You never have.<eos> No. Well, you still took care of me anyway.<eos> Yeah, look how great you turned out.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> - Don't worry. She'll be okay.<eos> - I know.<eos> She has you.
I don't understand.<eos> She sent me an e-mail.<eos> Telling me what she thinks of me in terms that are, well, highly unsuitable to repeat in a professional setting.<eos> Called me names that I haven't heard since the last mediation with my ex-husband.<eos> That is so surprising.<eos> Yes, I thought so, too. Which is why I found someone who did an obsessive study of Ker-rah for the past two years.<eos> Winn?<eos> I analyzed the typing speed and patterns on the hard drive.<eos> It didn't match Kara's, but it did match yours.<eos> I don't have very many regrets, Siobhan, but I do regret firing you the first time.

Lucy?<eos> I...<eos> Okay.<eos> (CLEARS THROAT)<eos> Ms. Grant, you have to leave now.<eos> Ker-rah, I thought I told you to tell Bernie Sanders that I am not interested in hot yoga.<eos> No, no.<eos> Livewire has escaped.<eos> She could be anywhere now, but you know where she'll come eventually. So head home and pack.<eos> I will arrange a car to take you and Carter to the airport and a plane, and guards.
Accept defeat, Kara Zor-El.<eos> I have already saved National City.<eos> Next, I will save the world.<eos> It's a nice photograph.<eos> Beautiful family.<eos> We were.<eos> So, Alex said Jeremiah saved your life.<eos> Were you with him?<eos> Were you with him at the end?<eos> His only thought was for you and the girls.
Um, Anderson, do you think you could hold on for just a skosh?<eos> (STAMMERS) Forgive me, but won't that kill Supergirl and Superman?<eos> Not if she flies up and detonates it over the city center.<eos> Then she and he skedaddle.<eos> She won't be able to come back to National City for roughly 50 years,<eos> - but that's a small price to pay - (LAUGHS) to save the world, right?<eos> What about the human beings?<eos> Will they be affected at all?<eos> The concussive force to properly displace the Kryptonite dust will result in some losses.<eos> Hmm, Anderson, I'm gonna have to call you back.
I do love wiping out a species.<eos> And you're next, human.<eos> MAXWELL:<eos> Good. You changed your mind.<eos> I was starting to regret saving it in the first place.<eos> For the record, I seriously thought the two of us would be having a lot more fun during Armageddon.<eos> Oh, Max, we're not here to talk about your bomb.<eos> - Supergirl has a plan.<eos> - (CHUCKLES)<eos> Which means Cat browbeat you.
- And Gwyneth.<eos> - Not true.<eos> I don't like the Coldplay guy, but ever since they consciously uncoupled, I like Gwynny more than ever.<eos> You see, Ker-rah, we have been through hell in the last few days.<eos> We survived.<eos> Lesson, don't ever take life for granted, always take good care of yourself, reject the latte and drink the green juice.<eos> Carpe diem.<eos> - Ms. Grant.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> I just want you to know that working for you is a true honor.
And now, the most important thing to me is that you find happiness.<eos> Find someone who appreciates how amazing you are.<eos> Kara, wait.<eos> Kara, why are you saying this?<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Always remember that.<eos> - Kara.<eos> - I can't. I have to go.<eos> I hate seeing you like this.
Making it the perfect place to hide.<eos> They've been there the whole time.<eos> I'll find them.<eos> -I'll shut it down.<eos> -Not by yourself you won't.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> - You're still under arrest.<eos> - And you're hurt.<eos> There are too many lives at risk to send an agent in alone.<eos> I'm not releasing you.
- Helping you pack.<eos> My...<eos> Ms. Grant, whatever I did, whatever you think I did, I can explain.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> - KARA:<eos> What is this?<eos> -(SIGHS)<eos> This is your new office.<eos> You're not firing me?<eos> Oh. No, no, no. I'm promoting you.
(SIGHS)<eos> - KARA:<eos> What is this?<eos> -(SIGHS)<eos> This is your new office.<eos> You're not firing me?<eos> Oh. No, no, no. I'm promoting you.<eos> Ker-rah, for the last two years, you have done nothing but arrange my travel perfectly and manage my schedule flawlessly.<eos> You (SIGHS) have become the best assistant I have ever had.<eos> And that is why I have to give you up.
She was hurt.<eos> I should have ended it.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> How?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> But there has to be something.<eos> And how many more chances are we gonna get?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Saying you're gonna kill is one thing, but... Actually doing it's something totally different.
Oh, my God, yes.<eos> It's a Banshee?<eos> It is.<eos> Banshees scream at their victims, getting them to harm themselves, and then they feed on their -- Brains.<eos> Right.<eos> Now, Banshees prey on the vulnerable, so I checked out all of the residents' medical records, and you have an atrial fibrillation, which can be treated with meds.<eos> But it means that -- I'm vulnerable?<eos> Am I next?<eos> My brother and I aren't gonna let that happen.<eos> We're gonna protect you, okay?
That is, we are the next.<eos> What do we do with the people here?<eos> They can neither go nor run.<eos> Before that, we can not run away.<eos> We have to fight.<eos> What about the Hornets?<eos> Are they planning an offensive?<eos> Not since the destruction of New York.<eos> Hold an earthquake!<eos> Colonel, we need you up here, right away.
It's really powerful.<eos> It will protect us.<eos> But I tell you Kate...<eos> It is always harder for me to keep my head from this slaughter.<eos> Hold on, Doc.<eos> They make this great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And now you're resting, yeah?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'll wake you up in a couple of hours, then help Linda.
But that is...<eos> Like soldiers.<eos> They follow instructions.<eos> Not much different from you and me.<eos> Are on a rescue mission.<eos> Still 2 clicks, Ma'am.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> The...<eos> This is not a scapegoat.<eos> Believing in the impossible made you the one who is you.
Do not forget:<eos> Your job is to save L.A., which it also costs.<eos> Your activation code for the device in L.A.<eos> Where is the bomb?<eos> - It is only urgently necessary to modify them.<eos> We'll let you know when it's finished.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Colonel Jayden also receives the bomb coordinates.<eos> If something happens to you, he brings the operation to an end.<eos> We will take you to the edge of the city.
You want to live!<eos> Come on, hurry!<eos> Fast!<eos> Do it already.<eos> All is well.<eos> The drones can not see the truck.<eos> You are safe.<eos> Saint.<eos> There is a doctor where we go.<eos> He cares for you, promised. - Thank you.
What the hell was that?<eos> You tell me.<eos> They are getting better by the minute.<eos> What was going on at the base?<eos> Rhys, he attacked the building.<eos> He took all of them as hostages.<eos> - Damn, damn it!<eos> Do not worry.<eos> - No!<eos> - I'll take you to the transport.
I'm still trying to reach Rhys.<eos> And if he is not dead, How fast you pee to his leg.<eos> Do not you think so?<eos> Anyway.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Rhys, sign up.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Rhys, please report!<eos> Great cart.<eos> I have a patient for you.
Just no pressure.<eos> Good work, Kate.<eos> - Let me at least come along.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> I am a paramedic.<eos> So someone need you there.<eos> - Does not matter at all.<eos> No.<eos> I'm tired of losing people who mean something to me.<eos> I do not want to lose you.
Ella!<eos> Gina!<eos> Carina!<eos> Gina!<eos> Carina!<eos> Ella!<eos> Ella!<eos> Hello, Winston, this is Operations.<eos> - Are you hearing me?<eos> - Hear you clearly.
- I have found it impossible to carry... - Girls. Girls!<eos> ...the heavy burden of responsibility, and to discharge my duties as King, as I would wish to do, without the help and support of the woman I love.<eos> This decision has been made less difficult to me by the sure knowledge that my brother has one matchless blessing...<eos> - Come in.<eos> Both of you.<eos> - ...enjoyed by so many of you, and not bestowed on me.<eos> A happy home, with his wife and children.<eos> And now we all have a new king.<eos> I wish him, and you, his people, happiness and prosperity... with all my heart.<eos> God bless you all.
The appropriate title for the woman I married.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Her Royal Highness.<eos> She is, after all, the wife of a former King.<eos> She's also a woman who has three husbands that still live and breathe.<eos> It is her right, Winston.<eos> I'm determined she shall have it. I'm determined she is shown respect.<eos> Will you fight for it?<eos> One more time?<eos> I have defended you so many times.
No, just a gathering of old friends who have come together to appeal to you in person, in the hope that you will do what we all think... would be...<eos> The right thing.<eos> - Regarding what?<eos> - The coronation.<eos> What about the coronation?<eos> We acknowledge... as a... as a member of the Queen's close family, you are entitled to attend, but also feel that the attendance at this sacred ceremony by one who, however good his reasons,<eos> It could strike a wrong note and would be deeply upsetting.<eos> To whom?<eos> - To everyone concerned.<eos> - I didn't ask you, Tommy.
Well, we know from where she gets that ice in her veins.<eos> And it wasn't from my own dear, weak brother.<eos> Nothing weak about the late King, sir.<eos> I'm sure I speak for everyone present when I call him a hero.<eos> Hear, hear.<eos> "My Lord, Archbishop, what a scold you are.<eos> And when your man is down, how very bold you are.<eos> Of Christian charity, how very scant you are, you Auld Lang Swine, how full of cant you are."<eos> A rhyme composed for your perfidious predecessor at the time of my abdication.<eos> I find the sentiment oddly applicable to you, too.
I imagine it must be difficult being dictated to like that by an employee.<eos> - I wasn't dictated to.<eos> - Am I missing something?<eos> You said this editor was telling you what he was going to print in your newspaper.<eos> He is. But I can't keep telling him what to write.<eos> I thought that was the point of owning a newspaper.<eos> Look, I'm just trying to help you, Tommy.<eos> I suggest you see this for the kind gesture that it is.<eos> What? That you are about to print an article that will cause deep distress to senior, let's be quite clear, the most senior members of the Royal family?<eos> That I'm warning you.
But that wasn't the plan, was it?<eos> Was it?<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> But if you can't make a vaccine<eos> This is much simpler.<eos> What kind of test is this?<eos> It's called kill the zombies.<eos> Last man or woman standing is to join the ranks of our loyal order of La Reina de los Muertos.<eos> What if we don't want to play?<eos> Then we shoot you.
Please.<eos> Help me!<eos> I'm gonna do you a favor.<eos> No!<eos> To speed things up, why don't we kill the lights?<eos> Las luces.<eos> Alright people,<eos> Let's win.<eos> Wow. No wonder you survived so long.<eos> We could really use some Zeros like you.
Jefe.<eos> She wants you.<eos> Did you use that vaccine?<eos> Everyone used the vaccine?<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Lucky for you, there's more to the story.<eos> I think he wants you to go with him.<eos> You think?<eos> All right, you go.<eos> I'll meet you guys at the entrance of the tunnels in one hour.
Lucky for you, there's more to the story.<eos> I think he wants you to go with him.<eos> You think?<eos> All right, you go.<eos> I'll meet you guys at the entrance of the tunnels in one hour.<eos> There you are, Roberta.<eos> Now, Hector.<eos> Would you like to tell us what you found out about our assassin?<eos> They were all a part of it.<eos> A United States military plot to assassinate you, La Reina.
- Don't do that.<eos> - Will you leave me alone?<eos> You don't want to respect nature?<eos> That's what I think of nature.<eos> Why are you so bitter?<eos> Your uncle wants to help.<eos> My uncle knows nothing of me.<eos> He left Marseille to hide away.<eos> He escaped from our problems.<eos> He didn't abandon you.
Seven footsteps.<eos> - What? I'll tell you when.<eos> You three should've stayed home today.<eos> Up against that wall.<eos> Stew!<eos> Make sure they don't escape around the back.<eos> You know, I am glad that y'all showed up though, 'cause I have always wanted one of these.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's finish this.<eos> See you on the other side.
Come on, it's fun.<eos> Can't you see how much fun I'm having?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. Have fun.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Thanks-thanks, Phil.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Uh, hello, everyone.<eos> Nice to see you.
I just got chills. So did I.<eos> Me, too.<eos> But I-I might have Lyme Disease.<eos> Just a few more signatures, and we'll be finished.<eos> Initial here to acknowledge that you've returned your key.<eos> Okay.<eos> As my future neighbor, I'd like you to have a key.<eos> Initial here to acknowledge you received it. I'm proud of you.<eos> You're taking this really well.<eos> Well, it's not like I'm never going to see you two again.
At least it won't take a hiker's leg off.<eos> What?<eos> I told you to remove those wolf traps all over the place.<eos> We will.<eos> But if the Greens bother us with these mobiles, we won't stand for it.<eos> - Don't start.<eos> We're within our rights.<eos> Our sheep were killed.<eos> We don't want these damn wolves!<eos> We'll send it all to forensics and let you know.
Yeah.<eos> Oh. Thank God.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Took it to the lost and found.<eos> Should have put it in the trash. Piece of shit didn't work.<eos> Couldn't even get it open.<eos> Did you go in to the city with some girl?<eos> I...<eos> Please don't lie to me.<eos> Heather said she saw you two on the Red and Tan bus.
Never.<eos> I still love you. I will always love you.<eos> You're not happy being married to me.<eos> What about you?<eos> Are you happy?<eos> Happy.<eos> I'm happy if I look at the obituary page and I'm not listed.<eos> Spielberg.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Oh, I, uh, I brought you something.
- I was told there would be doughnuts.<eos> - Yeah, they're coming.<eos> - Do we really have to be here all just because Matt walked in on... whatever it is he walked in on?<eos> Greg. You can't even say it.<eos> - Intercourse.<eos> - Oh, you're such a kiss-ass.<eos> The sooner we give her what she wants, the sooner this is over.<eos> Amen to that, girl.<eos> Yeah, you're buying me a new purse.<eos> - Sure. - Have-have you given any thought to what you would say to a child who-who saw you in that situation?
According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits.<eos> For all you know, I could be exercising right now. Are you?<eos> Eh, I'll do it tomorrow.<eos> It wouldn't be the worst thing if we were more active. Oh.<eos> You make an excellent point.<eos> Ooh, I think I'm getting a runner's high!<eos> Look at all these activities the university has.<eos> Rock climbing club, archery, flag football.<eos> Had me at flag, lost me at football.<eos> Yeah, I think it's great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?
So how can we help?<eos> Well, I know more women are buying comics than ever, but for some reason, I-I can't get 'em in here.<eos> All right, well, what have you tried so far?<eos> Uh, I've-I've been stocking more female-oriented titles.<eos> Uh, in the bathroom, I folded the end of the toilet paper into a triangle.<eos> And, uh, you are now sitting in the official breastfeeding area.<eos> Really?<eos> In a comic book store?<eos> I-I've got a camera right up here, so I could watch from the counter and make sure guys aren't being pervs.<eos> Anyway, so what do I got to do to-to get you in the door?
Like Puss in Boots.<eos> I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.<eos> Technically, "swashbuckler" is a combination of two terms.<eos> "Swash" referring to the sound of the sword.<eos> Swash.<eos> And then "buckler" meaning a small shield, which you don't have.<eos> We can still be swashers. Hmm.<eos> Well said, Puss.<eos> Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing club.<eos> Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn't a joke.
Well said, Puss.<eos> Gentlemen, welcome to the fencing club.<eos> Before we start, I just want to warn you, fencing isn't a joke.<eos> I hope you're not here because you think it's going to be like Star Wars.<eos> That's not why we're here.<eos> Yeah, I'm here because I think it's gonna be like Game of Thrones.<eos> And maybe a little Princess Bride. Ooh, ooh!<eos> I forgot about Princess Bride! That's my answer!<eos> Well, sorry to disappoint you, but fencing is a serious sport.<eos> If you're not willing to put in the effort, you might as well just leave now.
Just get it done.<eos> Where's this inspector?<eos> I want to talk with this guy.<eos> Dembe, the Pelican case.<eos> Marvin.<eos> Tell me you've found Andras Halmi.<eos> There's been a small wrinkle.<eos> Halmi is all that matters.<eos> The Director is working with the task force.<eos> Need I remind you that without Halmi, a crucial element of our plan vanishes faster than a fart in a fan factory?
Is that what you're saying?<eos> I'm trying to help you, all right?<eos> If you just do exactly what I say--<eos> You did this to us!<eos> You came into our lives.<eos> You targeted us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> Listen to me right now.<eos> These men-- they are going to be armed, they are going to be very, very dangerous, and they are going to try to hurt you.
He's your buffer?<eos> Get the hell off me!<eos> Go on!<eos> Take these cuffs off!<eos> And he's our suspect.<eos> Get the hell off me! Get off!<eos> Go on!<eos> Take these cuffs off!<eos> See how tough you are!<eos> You think that badge makes you special? !
Well... time to get dressed. Spa day's over.<eos> Yeah, but before we go, can you please give me the number of your tattoo artist?<eos> You're right...<eos> The guy's a bloody genius.<eos> And when you I.D.'d the tattoo, did you pull the towel off, or did it just... fall off?<eos> Well, actually, Kate pulled the towel off...<eos> But I'm not quite sure how this is relevant.<eos> - You're pathetic, bro.<eos> - Somebody's got to write this report. Wow.<eos> So, Hayley, it must have been pretty hard for you guys to chase her 'cause you and Beckett were both wearing towels, right? Hey.
I like the sound of that.<eos> If that's cool with you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If it's cool with you.<eos> Is it cool with me?<eos> Bro, you took a bullet for me.<eos> You've got a wife...<eos> A pregnant wife at home, you got a little girl who depends on you, and yet, you still...<eos> Come here.<eos> I'm just gonna give you guys a moment.
But damn it, I understand there's a bunch of Canadians here, and I'm gonna do something about it!<eos> All right, everyone, listen up.<eos> In order for better understanding, we have asked students of Canadian origin to introduce you to their culture and...<eos> Hey, Leslie, shut your fucking mouth! ...<eos> To introduce you to their culture and customs.<eos> So let's give them our undivided attention as they take us on a whirlwind journey through their diverse history.<eos> We are the Hopewell and Abenaki, first settlers of Canadian soil, guy.<eos> We are French and British explorers, seeking furs and goods.<eos> Yeah, and I'm Dan Rather, and I got news for you...<eos> Nobody wants you here! Sorry.
I don't remember you like this.<eos> I remember you like this.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Now, if anyone has anything they want to say, you raise your hands if you do.<eos> Very, slowly.<eos> Yeah, Carol?<eos> They were about to give you a second chance, you dumb donkey. What?<eos> !<eos> Shut up!<eos> You guys, you're not gonna regret this, I promise, and look, like I said, I would never hurt you guys.
Tell me what does music mean to you?
I wish I'd gotten a chance to meet him.<eos> I'm sorry I gave you a hard time about having so much stuff.<eos> Fuck, say something...<eos> Anything.<eos> What's the word for... For this? Oh.<eos> You know, we'd settle for no reduction in pension and a slight raise in health care and base pay.<eos> Sounds reasonable, doesn't it?<eos> It's reasonable, but, you know, you got to get past all this bullshit.<eos> The lawyers and Bibens and Union Bobs.<eos> You got to sit down and talk woman to woman.
Hey, you got rats in here or something?<eos> God dammit.<eos> This doesn't end.<eos> Angie?<eos> Thank God.<eos> I thought I was losing my mind.<eos> What in God's name?<eos> No!<eos> How did I get here?<eos> Look at all of you.
Oh hell no.<eos> Oh hell yes.<eos> I don't want anybody recognizing you.<eos> Probably some bounty hunters lurking around that heard one of those broadcasts.<eos> We did not get you this far to lose you to neo-nazi-numbskulls.<eos> Yes, dear.<eos> Anything you say, dear.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If we're not out in ten minutes<eos> We'll come busting in after you. No.

That is the sound of a man's sphincter shrinking.<eos> Ah, it's your money.<eos> Pay up.<eos> What? I just made you look good in front of your date.<eos> You should be paying me.<eos> - Oh, wait, this isn't a...<eos> - It's not?<eos> Why did I pay, then?<eos> You're saying that I'm not getting any or...<eos> It's good to see you two together.
Dad, are you gonna eat with us?<eos> No.<eos> I can find someplace else to eat.<eos> KYLIE: This is so fake.<eos> In real life, you have to turn your head to the side, and open your mouth only a little.<eos> That way the boy still has to work to get it all the way open.<eos> I like scary movies.<eos> PG is for babies.<eos> TIM: You guys like scary movies,huh?<eos> I got a good one for you, but it's rated R.
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, God, uh, uh, Melissa, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.<eos> No, Melissa, Melissa, I...<eos> Oh, hey, Phil.<eos> Top of the morning.<eos> So you like playing with guns, huh?<eos> No, no, no...<eos> No!<eos> My gun was unloaded.<eos> - I would've never hurt you guys.
Ha.<eos> Gail Klosterman! Have you come down with Benjamin Button's disease?<eos> 'Cause you look ten years younger.<eos> And you looked 18 before.<eos> Hey, little girl, you want some candy?<eos> My legs are gonna live vicariously through yours.<eos> - Oh, to be that pool water right now.<eos> - Tandy, shut your friggin' trap!<eos> One friggin' trap-shutting coming up.<eos> I'm gonna be real quiet for you so you guys can enjoy your conversation.

Okay, Tandy, we're gonna have to add<eos> "no talking-slash-total silence" to your punishment.<eos> I'm just trying to spread good cheer.<eos> You know, show everybody how much I care about them.<eos> I'm not bothering you guys, am I?
She comes at Christmas.<eos> First of all, I ripped my hand out of the cuff.<eos> Well, you saved us, Len.<eos> Yeah, that's not why I mauled myself.<eos> I-I wanted to see if I could do it.<eos> It hurt like a mother, but it didn't wig me out at all.<eos> I picked up my thumb like it was a mini hot dog. Len, I'm not gonna lie.<eos> That's worrisome.<eos> And that girl -- my brain said I should help you, but I-I didn't really feel anything...<eos> For you or her.
Agent Mojtabai.<eos> When?<eos> Okay, got it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> A video was just sent to several news outlets.<eos> It was turned over to the Bureau a few minutes ago.<eos> My name is Michael Hasti, and I am a senior software engineer for Lazarum Systems.<eos> This morning, six of us were taken in retaliation for our company's criminal collaboration with the state of Israel on the missile-defense system known as the Iron Dome.<eos> Our captors send this message to all who aid their sworn enemy...<eos> "We will find you and you will pay for your crimes.
I could have told you sooner if I had all the information.<eos> You mean you could have given up sooner.<eos> Yes, you're right... because there's nothing to be done.<eos> You could try!<eos> You could make an effort instead of just giving up and walking away!<eos> And you don't think I want to?<eos> All right, we're not doing this.<eos> Could you leave us alone for a second, please?<eos> Oh, absolutely, I'm gonna leave, and I'm gonna take Kamal with me, all right?<eos> 'Cause this isn't about you two!
Oh, honey, of course it's your house.<eos> Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?<eos> All right.<eos> Let's start over.<eos> I'm redecorating.<eos> The furniture, the carpeting, the walls.<eos> I'm changing everything that depresses me when I look at it.<eos> Try not to be one of those things.<eos> May I say something?<eos> Is it about how I can't have new wallpaper 'cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?
My father made it just for you.<eos> It's tart, but savory.<eos> ♪ Boogers and cum! ♪ ♪ Bein' a food critic's easy!<eos> ♪ ♪ Boogers and cum! ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, you feel a little queasy?<eos> ♪ ♪ Do you need a diagnosis?

It's like, "Hi.<eos> Would you like some butter with your eye rolls?"<eos> I know.<eos> It's like, "Don't fill up on eye rolls, Erica.<eos> Save room for dinner."<eos> We have fun.<eos> But seriously, I'm not even trying to attract Phil.<eos> I think I just need to tamp down my essence, find something a little more, I don't know, boring.<eos> Oh, like what you have on.<eos> I juiced up some crickets for you guys.
Fire pit?<eos> Bingo.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Todd, you know what's going on.<eos> Is that bacon?<eos> !<eos> Where did you find this? Well...<eos> I'll tell you where he found it.<eos> He found it at a house up the road.<eos> It has solar panels, so the freezer's still working. He told me about it yesterday, made me promise not to say anything 'cause he wanted to surprise you guys.
Join in.<eos> - Todd...<eos> - Okay, Todd, what's the real story?<eos> This was me.<eos> I found the bacon.<eos> Tandy caught me eating it, he had a little bit, too, but... this was all me.<eos> Surprise, surprise.<eos> The fat guy ate the bacon.<eos> And I'm so sorry.<eos> I'll never be able to forgive myself because I lied to all of you, and I lied to the woman that I love.
Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.<eos> Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo.<eos> Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again.<eos> Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favorite toothpick-delivered meatball.<eos> If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you don't ask too many questions.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Where does he work?<eos> How does he get the helium?<eos> How many questions are too many questions?<eos> Maybe he's not for you.
I promise this is the last time.<eos> It says right here on Wikipedia.<eos> "A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties."<eos> How can you trust Wikipedia if they use "between" to refer to three parties?<eos> They should've used "among," right?<eos> Or "amongst," if they were feeling whimsically archaic.<eos> All right, enough with the chitchat.<eos> Are we gonna watch Ernest Goes to Jail or not?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> But don't be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.
Jumbo?<eos> Seriously?<eos> I was being optimistic.<eos> Wait.<eos> That was you making all that noise last night?<eos> I thought that was Amelia.<eos> - Well, you aren't shy.<eos> - And you have a filthy mouth.<eos> Okay, can we not talk about this? Please.<eos> I am begging you.
So, please welcome action star and hero Steven Seagal.<eos> You got a problem with me?<eos> I'm your worst nightmare.<eos> I have no fear of death.<eos> More important, I don't fear life.<eos> I'm a big action-movie star, and people are pretty stoked on me.<eos> And then I put a picture of myself up on the Internet, and I had my shirt off, and I said,<eos> "Do you think I'm ripped?" and some people commented saying I didn't look ripped, that I was fat, and they called me Steven SeBoomBoom, and so then I put another picture on the Internet, and I thought people would be stoked on me, but they said I looked like a fat turd, and they said I wasn't buff.<eos> Body shaming isn't cool,<eos> And if p-people shame you on the Internet, You have to make sure that you stay... You stay strong,

All right, buddy, let's go.<eos> I shit on all of you!<eos> Seagal!<eos> Fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you!<eos> Give me that, you stupid bitch.<eos> What a lovely charity event. I suppose you're all feeling<eos> Pretty good about yourselves, hmmm?<eos> What have you done?<eos> You've raised $300 by spending $500,000 On Filet Mignon and crystal glasses.<eos> Look at you.
You say fat shaming is wrong, So in response you show off your abs.<eos> You're the one fat shaming, idiot!<eos> What's the matter with you people?<eos> You're sad that people are mean?<eos> Well, I'm sorry, the world isn't one big liberal-arts college campus!<eos> We eat too much.<eos> We take our spoiled lives for granted.<eos> Feel a little bad about it sometimes.<eos> No, you want to put all your shit up on the Internet And have every single person say, "Hooray for you!"<eos> Fuck you.

So excited about this one.<eos> The agency said it's their favorite candidate.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Hi... Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> - W-W-W-Wait... - Wait, w-w-w-wait, please, please.<eos> - Oh, hell, no...<eos> - wait, wait, please.<eos> Please, we heard through the grapevine you're in need of expert child care.<eos> And we are specialists in the field.<eos> You're lactation specialists, and the last time we saw you,
We are very, very desperate for money.<eos> We tried to sell my eggs.<eos> But... there... there were none.<eos> Okay, well, not the strongest opener.<eos> We're great with kids, so... goo-goo-ga-ga.<eos> We speak their language.<eos> We actually... we spend two hours a day as babies.<eos> - Two hours? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Um, uh, you can definitely<eos> - stop speaking tha-that language. - Yeah. Um, and we're not gonna hire you.
Uh, and that's obvious.<eos> So you can just save your breath.<eos> Not gonna happen. We get it... we totally understand.<eos> Just one small wrinkle.<eos> Hmm? Could we borrow a thousand dollars?<eos> - No.<eos> - No. Could we sleep on your couch?<eos> - I think we've given you a lot to chew on.<eos> - Yep. - So we'll leave you with that.<eos> And... possibly see you Monday.
- Yep. - So we'll leave you with that.<eos> And... possibly see you Monday.<eos> - No.<eos> - No? Tonita, thank you for coming.<eos> Colleen speaks so highly of you.<eos> We've just never left Lark with anyone for more than a few hours, so th-this is kind of a... a big adjustment for us.<eos> I promise I will treat her like my child.<eos> Okay. May I?<eos> Um... yeah, okay.<eos> I guess we-we'll just... go run some errands and let you two get to know each other.
I walked into an ambush.<eos> An intervention... you need to quit before you kill us all.<eos> I'm not gonna do that.<eos> The senator, the work she's doing, the law she's fighting for... it could be responsible for saving millions.<eos> I need to help.<eos> No.<eos> They're right.<eos> What?<eos> It's too risky.<eos> For all of you.
What?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, that blade... it chooses who it finds worthy.<eos> And it chooses its miracles.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Right now all that matters is I need to be with my family while I can be.<eos> Come to Granny's with me.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Robin and I need to protect Roland and the baby from Zelena.<eos> I'll catch up with you later.
And remember... whenever you're scared, all you have to do is look... inside.<eos> We're all braver than we think if we just look deep enough.<eos> Sleep tight.<eos> I'll see you in the morning, Liam.<eos> Thank you, Killian.<eos> You named your boy Liam.<eos> After my brother, after the son... you abandoned.<eos> Was he really that easy to replace?<eos> I wasn't trying to replace him.<eos> I was trying to honor him, to honor you both.
- Yeah, the graft?<eos> - Counseling.<eos> It gave us a sense of where we were, which was nowhere.<eos> But still...<eos> Second-degree burns on the chest.<eos> Do you even want to work it out with Kepner?<eos> Can we not do this right now?<eos> Sure.<eos> But one thing our therapist said that turned out to be true...<eos> Do not have sex while you're sorting things out.
OK, see you on the estate.<eos> Why is she jacking baby food?<eos> I know.<eos> You should see her son.<eos> Who's her son?<eos> Who's her son, tell me.<eos> Connor.<eos> Dating is never easy and can often throw up a lot of problems...<eos> Agents of Satan, we shan't be swayed.<eos> ...promising to hook you up with whoever you fancy whenever you fancy it...
It's been a long time since I felt up someone other than myself, you know?<eos> Keep Connor busy tonight, won't ya?<eos> Mandy, I'm sorry about what happened in the bedroom.<eos> That's nothin', babe.<eos> If I had a penny for every girl that's hand-pumped his willy, I'd have a fuckin' yacht!<eos> You said he's never had a girlfriend.<eos> No, he ain't, but he's got to empty the trash into somethin', ain't he?<eos> An' there's never been at a shortage of friendly girls to off-load his shit in, if you know what I mean.<eos> Fornicators! Film watchers! Fashionistas!<eos> A demonic spirit is workin' in your life, leading you to the gangsters and witch doctors of Tower Hamlets, giving them the last of your cash monies for drugs and this ting.
Why are the Asian girls drawing pictures of us being gay?<eos> What's wrong with being gay? Nothing wrong with that.<eos> But we aren't.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm not either!<eos> That is completely irrelevant, okay?<eos> What matters, and the reason I brought you in here, Is that you understand affirmative consent.<eos> What's that?<eos> If there is a romantic relationship here, You have to make sure your partner is comfortable With any sexual exploration.<eos> Aah! Now, in a gay relationship, it gets a little trickier, But you still have to follow some guidelines, all right?
You don't even try to know me, Dad!<eos> I want to, Shelly!<eos> I just sometimes feel like you hate me!<eos> I feel like you hate me, Randy!<eos> I don't hate you!<eos> I love you!<eos> I need to be a better husband, a better father!<eos> We all need to be better to each other!<eos> Okay, maybe I need to stop being so angry!<eos> I love you guys.
Where there are no goals, there is no hope.<eos> Where there is no future, there is no future.<eos> Winsley Cosmetics is the future and I am so proud of...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm Tracey and I want to say a few words.<eos> I used to wanna be in you lot's gang.<eos> But now I see this lifestyle for what it really is.<eos> It's just greed.<eos> It's just money.<eos> Wouldn't you rather have friends and people that love you,
It's still in the millions.<eos> - Beautiful.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Milo.<eos> Welcome to Belize.<eos> Whew.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Yo.<eos> Great to see you.
He didn't.<eos> Someone put a goat in my pool.<eos> Are you saying we stole this boat?<eos> Milo, that doesn't sound smart, brah.<eos> - What the fuck are you doing? - Just take it easy,<eos> I'm just flexing a little muscle.<eos> You do remember how to do that, don't you Joel?<eos> You just implicated us in piracy!<eos> Jesus Christ, Milo.<eos> I cannot believe I chose you guys - to stand shoulder to shoulder with me.
- No, don't turn - this shit around on me, brah. - Wait,<eos> - you didn't want to come, either? -I...<eos> I wasn't sure if I was gonna be able to come.<eos> - The man just willed us his villa. -If you believe that,<eos> - Well, maybe he just got overexcited because we're all here.<eos> We're going home.<eos> So if you could... if you could call us a ride...<eos> You all want to go?<eos> If you do, that's fine...<eos> it's just that Joel has a habit of speaking for all of you.
We're going home.<eos> So if you could... if you could call us a ride...<eos> You all want to go?<eos> If you do, that's fine...<eos> it's just that Joel has a habit of speaking for all of you.<eos> - He can't help it, it's his inner teacher.<eos> -GUS:<eos> We all want to split. All right.<eos> Flight's at 11:00.<eos> I'll make sure you're on it.

- I'm gonna try.<eos> - I think that's a great idea, Phil.<eos> You know, it could gain some points with the group.<eos> I'm not trying to gain points...<eos> That sounds gross.<eos> I'm trying to earn points.<eos> There's a big difference. Well, I can see the difference.<eos> And I think soon the others will, too.<eos> I mean, Todd already has, huh?<eos> Yeah. It's so nice to see the two of you fisting each other again.
You know, C to the T, and... and, uh... such.<eos> Okay, tell you what.<eos> We'll negotiate with you a little on this one, but, like, just one back and forth, and then you got to do whatever we land on. Okay?<eos> So, uh, punishment-wise, wh-what you thinking?<eos> None.<eos> Okay, okay, I hear you.<eos> But here's what I'm coming back with.<eos> Some punishment.<eos> After everything I've done for you guys?<eos> Look at how crappy this place got in the one day that I haven't been fixing things for you.
Nice job using your lottery pick this year on Kristaps Porzingis.<eos> Darko Milicic.<eos> We're really talking basketball now?<eos> I caught you trying to put paperclips in here a couple of weeks ago.<eos> You thought it was for knick knacks.<eos> And Porzingis is built for the triangle.<eos> Yeah, implementing that motion offense with Carmelo, the biggest ball-stopper in the league on your team, what could go wrong?<eos> Can I help you fellas?<eos> Are you investigating Mike Hayden's murder?<eos> We are. What can we do for you?
Oh, hey, break it up!<eos> Cool off, Charlie, go get some water.<eos> I'll talk to you in a minute.<eos> Look, I gotta talk to Charlie.<eos> You mind taking over practice?<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> Huddle up!<eos> Here's what's gonna happen, gentlemen, you're gonna pick it up.<eos> I want to see ball movement, proper screens, hard cuts to the hole.<eos> And if I don't, I'm going to run you like dogs.

You did.<eos> - Wally.<eos> - Agatha.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Thank goodness.<eos> No, you can't be here.<eos> The buyers are on their way.<eos> - Buyers?<eos> - Blomfeld's selling them to a third party.<eos> I need to get you three out of here.
We were... we were great together.<eos> And I was just scared.<eos> You had no idea any of this was gonna happen.<eos> I wasted so much energy on why it wouldn't work, when I could've been...<eos> I loved him.<eos> And... and I... he was right in front of me, and I should've just held onto him.<eos> Instead, I just pushed him away.<eos> And now, he's gone.<eos> Here.<eos> I don't know how I could've gotten through today without all of you.
So everybody just be cool, give him his space, you know, when he walks in here with a full-grown woman.<eos> Hi, everyone, this is Clementine. Hi.<eos> Wow, wow.<eos> Hi.<eos> So nice to finally meet you all.<eos> And you as well.<eos> That was loud.<eos> We always enjoy welcoming a new person<eos> - into our familial enclave. - Thank you. So, you two are fellow styoo-dents?<eos> Why are you talking like that? Don't interrupt your father, son.
The down diggity low.<eos> - Okay, I got it. Yeah.<eos> - How low can you go?<eos> Got it. Thanks.<eos> - XXL.<eos> Extra, extra low.<eos> - Thanks. Yeah. I got it.<eos> Oh, I, uh, have those numbers that you were asking Matt about.<eos> Anyway, I got to split.<eos> But, um, I like you two as a couple.
All right, we'll do eight, four each? - Mm.<eos> - Fine, a dozen.<eos> Okay, scale of 1 to 10, how badly does this party suck so far?<eos> Like 1 sucks most or 10 sucks most?<eos> 'Cause it's one of those.<eos> Come on!<eos> Look, I only came here for the free food.<eos> There's no food. Your guests are making the dinner.<eos> It's like you didn't even want to have a party.<eos> Did somebody force you to have this party?
The foosas are leaving!<eos> Whoo-hoo! Whew! Thank the gods that Clover put that net trap there.<eos> It really saved us.<eos> Just doing my job. And thank the gods even more that I was genius enough to put my food pyramid in front of that net trap, eh?<eos> You didn't even know it was there.<eos> Hmm? Maurice, are you even listening to yourself with your, "Clover's net trap, ooh!"<eos> And all your doubt and stuff.<eos> You never support me.<eos> You kidding me? You were just standing on my shoulders so I could be eaten first.<eos> I was literally supporting you.
You see what happens when I am not supported by you, Maurice?<eos> For the record, I never told you to turn a foosa into a lemur.<eos> - Maybe not in so many words.<eos> - Not in any words.<eos> - Pretty sure there were a few.<eos> - No. - One?<eos> - None.<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> Pretty... sure.<eos> I can hear you.
What is this stuff?<eos> [sniffing] Spices?<eos> Cooking spices?<eos> Cooking spices?<eos> We're- - We're being marinated?<eos> ! People, it's really more of a dry rub than a marinade.<eos> Mmm, it smells so good.<eos> So... very... hungry.<eos> I have to... [all scream] [muffled shouting]<eos> - [screaming] - [roaring] I will set you free!
-All right!<eos> I love it!<eos> -[cheering] I love a wedding!<eos> What was that?<eos> I know, right?<eos> My peoples were loving it out there!<eos> Do you have any idea what you're getting into?<eos> Yeah. What's the big deal? Lots of idiots get married all the time.<eos> I want to thank you all for coming to our engagement party.<eos> This wedding is gonna be pretty sick, so it's a big honor... for you.
[gasps] I never imagined she'd intentionally harm King Julien, but this looks bad.<eos> Oh! Maybe she just likes to whittle.<eos> [gasps]<eos> Poison? Okay, that might be something.<eos> "I can't wait to marry King Julien so I can kill him!"<eos> Maybe she is trying to hurt King Julien.<eos> Who's trying to hurt me?<eos> Your Majesty, although it pains me to say this--<eos> Not really, but whatever.<eos> --my sister means to harm you.
Oh, oh! Now you done did it!<eos> You are officially uninvited from the hottest wedding of the season!<eos> [Xixi] A royal wedding.<eos> An event that comes but once every five to seven months, depending on food supply and predator mating habits.<eos> I'm Xixi, and I'll be here with you for every bow, every vow, and every... couldn't-come-up-with- a-third-word-that-rhymes.<eos> I'm sorry Clover couldn't make it.<eos> Yeah, but I feel her presence.<eos> Probably because she's still required to be here for security purposes.<eos> I'm not pointing fingers and I'm not mad, but why didn't you tell me marriage was forever before you talked me into getting married?<eos> I didn't talk you into getting married.
Gone, Maurice. I decided to have Mort gather up all the kingdom's refuse and toss it in that smelly mountain pit on the other side of the island.<eos> Smelly mountain?<eos> You mean the volcano?<eos> !<eos> - [rumbling] - [Mort] Make a hole! King Julien, Maurice just told me you're giving me a new, uh... partner?<eos> !<eos> That's correct, Clover. To better protect our kingdom, I have decided to have Timo design you a new crime-fighting buddy.<eos> Observe.<eos> - [roars] - Aah! I'm calling it the Mega-gecko 2.0.<eos> [Clover yelling] Ah, look at that, you're getting along already.
Hmm.<eos> I am juicy. With this vessel by your side, you will have all you need to make the right decisions for yourself and the kingdom.<eos> Wait a second. How do I know you're not just saying this so you can go on your vacation?<eos> I, uh...<eos> Kidding! Of course my kingly soul will live on in a pineapple after I die.<eos> It makes perfect sense.<eos> Now to use the souls of my ancestors to be the best king I can be.<eos> Ha ha ha! - No, it's my foosa ball!<eos> - It's my foosa ball!<eos> Allow me to use the wisdom of my ancestors to settle this dispute for you, children.
I can't decide if I should pull one of these small rocks out.<eos> Very interesting problem.<eos> Let me consult King Julien the Painfully Oblivious.<eos> Go for it, baby!<eos> Aah! Thanks for the advice, Your Majesty!<eos> [Julien] You're welcome!<eos> [Maurice] Ohh, King Julien, what is so important that you called us here in the middle of the night?<eos> Was there a sudden and unexpected security breach that requires my immediate attention?<eos> Please, tell me there was a sudden and unexpected security breach that requires my immediate attention!<eos> I called you here to inform you of an important epiphany I had earlier this very afternoon.
And Julien will love it again as soon as I--<eos> Heh heh heh. Foosa hungry.<eos> Foosa lunchtime!<eos> Could you guys wait here?<eos> I have to run a quick errand.<eos> Trust me, these haunches will be worth it.<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> It looks like he's headed this way.<eos> [Julien] Can't we go any faster?<eos> We could if I didn't have to carry you.
Give it to me, baby!<eos> [roaring] [shrieking] See?<eos> I told you the gods were good.<eos> Fee-ee-ee-eet!<eos> Oh, Maurice!<eos> I can't hold you!<eos> And I can't hold Mort!<eos> And I-<eos> - Feet!<eos> King Julien, let the pineapple go and give us your hand so we can pull you up.
I'm going home, baby.<eos> I thought he'd never leave.<eos> [Julien] I heard that.<eos> He looks so peaceful.<eos> I can have his body, right?<eos> [snoring] [babbles, coughs] King Julien, you're okay?<eos> Yes. Because I chose life, Maurice.<eos> Life!<eos> I chose making decisions for myself and dancing on all days, not just Sundays.<eos> I love you, King Julien!
Ta-da!<eos> I designed it myself.<eos> Look how King Julien stares right at you.<eos> Uh...<eos> Yeah. I got that.<eos> By putting this poster of me in each and every household.<eos> I will bring happiness to all of my peeps!<eos> Um, you sure everyone wants that in their bedrooms, Your Majesty?<eos> It's just so exciting to have the King right here in our boudoir.<eos> Ted! Hm, you're right, Clover.
Don't eat me! Please! The horror.<eos> I'm taking every precaution to protect you, but just wanted to remind you that these things have not going smoothly in the past.<eos> If they're so dangerous, why do I have to go? [imitates beeping]<eos> News flash! I'm pretty important,<eos> Because you're the king and it's your job.<eos> Plus, if you don't go, the crocodiles will be majorly offended.<eos> And we all know what happens when crocodiles are offended.<eos> Okay, here's the dilly.<eos> I think we should send someone else in my place.<eos> We can't. The crocodiles know what you look like. So just send someone who looks like me.
Respeck.<eos> Well, my grandma always said, "You gotta make hay while the sun shines."<eos> That reminds me, is that little guy with you?<eos> Must eat something! The hunger...<eos> The hunger!<eos> Mort, you've been down here for ten minutes.<eos> Your tail isn't even trapped under a rock.<eos> Now, I don't want to brag, but I went down into a deep, dark, scary hole to save one lemur and ended up saving two! Allow me to introduce, the Gorch.<eos> Now. now. friends. No need to be afraid.<eos> After al, if you keep going the way you're headed, pretty soon you're gonna get there.
Let tha people see exactly why it is that they love me. On it.<eos> What can I do King julien? Put me to work!<eos> I'm leaving you two in charge of, super top secret emergency plan C.<eos> What is it?<eos> Dig up dirt on Doc Sugarfoot to ruin his reputation and make evelyone hate him so they'll vote for me.<eos> On it!<eos> My next guest is the King of Madagascar, the Prince of Parties, the Archduke of Good Times, the Comptroller of--<eos> Okay! They get it, Xixi! Er, um, please welcome King Julien!<eos> King Julien, we're all dying to know, is the jungle a better place with you on the throne?<eos> Think of all the parties and good times we've had since I squashed Uncle King Julien's reign of fear and saved you all from the foosa.
This is my oldest and bestest friend,<eos> Rob "The Party Animal" McTodd.<eos> I haven't seen him since...<eos> He was banished for nearly giving your uncle a heart attack when Rob pranked him on his birthday.<eos> Oh! You should have seen your faces!<eos> Speaking of faces, uh, what happened to yours?<eos> I had a little work done. Nothing much.<eos> Just a brow lift, eye tightening, chin tuck, nose re-nostriling, whale blubber lip enhancement, packing peanuts in the cheeks.<eos> Pretty st-st-st-standard. Gotta keep the age gremlins away.<eos> You mean that you did ...
Start the operation, Doc. I'm ready!<eos> Now, this won't hurt a bit, Mr. King Julien,<eos> It'll hurt a lot because we're doing surgery out of a cave!<eos> What have you done to my King Julien?<eos> No!<eos> Not the hair, it cost me a fortune! And the brow lift!<eos> You're stretching the --<eos> Stop right there, you!<eos> This would be a lot easier if I had hands!<eos> Don't worry, I'll get you out of this.
Fantastic Fred, Giant Scorpion, and friend to everyone everywhere, who only ever ate that one baby.<eos> -The end." -[crowd cheering]<eos> Way to go, Fred!<eos> Nice work, Your Majesty.<eos> Although, I could have written it better.<eos> Mr. Marvelous Fantastic Fred, can I have your autograph?<eos> Sure there, little fella.<eos> Just kidding.<eos> I wasn't gonna eat this baby.<eos> I so fooled you guys.
Great, now that that's settled, listen up.<eos> This is a big moment for me. I've gotta be honest, I was lost thinking Frank wasn't real, but I know now that Frank is real and watching over all of us!<eos> King Julien, I will now bestow upon your people an important message.<eos> Of course, buddy. Many of you may be wondering why I am here.<eos> Am I being promoted to Sky God?<eos> A follow-up question:<eos> Does my new position come with a superpower?<eos> Because, I can't decide if I want to make things explode with my brainy parts, or have tentacles for hands.<eos> And everyone would be like, "Oh, King Julien, your super awesome tentacle hands are so super awesome that they're freaking me out, man!"<eos> Sorry. Proceed. I am here because my brother, Larry the Volcano God, is angry with all of you.
King Julien by throwing him into the volcano by sundown today.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Let's... Wait, what you say what?<eos> Let's get him!<eos> [all shouting] [screams] [Maurice] King Julien, what are you doing?<eos> I'm hiding from my people.<eos> -They're hunting me.<eos> -No one's hunting you. King Julien, are you in there?<eos> I just need your measurements.<eos> I'm not here to sacrifice you.
So, how many crocodiles does it take to eat a mango?<eos> [laughs] What?<eos> That's crazy!<eos> That's genius, Willie!<eos> Your Majesty, he hasn't said the punch line yet.<eos> What? Oh.<eos> Too cerebral. Not "moist"!<eos> King Jul--<eos> Enough with the speeches, Tammy.<eos> Get to it. Right, okay. Get ready, because you're in for a real treat.
Mort, you can give it a rest.<eos> King Julien's perfectly healthy.<eos> [cries loudly] [sneezes] Ugh! Oh, come on, man!<eos> Seriously?<eos> It's like a jump rope. I'll bring you a casserole later!<eos> Your Majesty, Maurice and I both feel this has gone far enough.<eos> And Frank has decided my life has gone far enough.<eos> ♪ Coming for... ♪<eos> Masikura? What will happen when I die?<eos> Well, the ghost that lives in your head will teleport to the magical realm of Frank-ri La, where your ancestors will examine every selfish act you've ever committed, and judge you harshly!
I brought one to replace it.<eos> I feel like I pushed you off a cliff maybe.<eos> [laughs] I don't really remember.<eos> [groans] Oh!<eos> I'm sorry. I apologize.<eos> Lo siento.<eos> Let the healing begin.<eos> [sighs] Admitting everything you've done wrong your entire life really takes it out of you.<eos> It's a shame I didn't think to do it until I found out I only had a few days to live.<eos> I'm gonna go ahead and stop you there, and remind you that you aren't really dying.
-Huh? Your uncle is working with the Foosa to steal your kingdom.<eos> Whoo, that's a heck of an accusation after everything I've done for you.<eos> What have you ever done for me?<eos> It's an expression, Clover.<eos> I knew it!<eos> Poison!<eos> She went a little heavy on the cilantro, but I'd hardly call it poison.<eos> No, King Julien.<eos> You're not sick after all.<eos> You're showing symptoms because you're being poisoned by my sister!
Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts.<eos> I don't sound like that.<eos> Here are some images of naked grandma butts.<eos> Hey. Good news, everybody.<eos> Now that I'm no longer with Amy,<eos> I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it?<eos> Well, you realize you won't be going alone--<eos> I'll be there the whole time.<eos> Providing fish and pilgrim facts.<eos> Can you people hear me?
How could you do that without consulting me?<eos> It's not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual.<eos> Now you're just trying to take over the whole thing.<eos> You know, maybe I should go solo.<eos> But someone joined our page.<eos> We have an actual fan.<eos> All right. This thing's bigger than you and me-- band's back together.<eos> So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, "I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock."
I have to say it not in the English language.<eos> Enough. Thank you. Gracias, gracias, gracias.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> I hope that somebody understood it, because--yeah, I hope.<eos> - Do you speak Spanish?<eos> - No, not really, but I think I understood the sentiment.<eos> - Yeah, same.<eos> - Me llamo Erik Winklestrauss.<eos> - Hailey Rutledge. - I had to, I--<eos> - Ah, I see you've met.
What are you, a... chiropractor?<eos> - A financial guy?<eos> - I'm an architect.<eos> I bet you are.<eos> - What movie are you queueing for?<eos> - The Winter Song.<eos> Jake Gyllenhaal gets hit by a bus and winds up in a wheelchair.<eos> Rosamund Pike leaves him for his brother and he kills himself.<eos> Boom.<eos> Fuck you.
Your job is to take the bodies away.<eos> Well, lucky for all of us, this body ain't dead yet.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I think we're already too late.<eos> No. There's a heartbeat.<eos> Barely.<eos> We are not an emergency room.<eos> We're not equipped for this.<eos> This man is dying, and your first thought is to bring him here?<eos> Actually, my first thought was to call you and have you come to my place, but I had some concern you wouldn't show, so...
First of all, this is not unsweetened lemonade, okay?<eos> Uh, if we could just be a little more, uh, conscious of labeling things.<eos> You know.<eos> Piece of tape, "urine."<eos> And this is kind of the main thing... um...<eos> Phil did not go out searching for the bull.<eos> You know, I let him out of the stocks, and he just drove off.<eos> So h-he's just, like, gone gone?<eos> D-Did he say anything?<eos> Yeah, he said to tell all you guys that you don't have to worry about him anymore.
He is as bad as your body odour.<eos> Just piss off.<eos> Have they stopped running hot water through the council estates? - You're a dick.<eos> - You smell like poo poo.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I've left my... juice at the bar.<eos> It's the universe that's alarmed<eos> Like a superstar lost a credit card.<eos> I just got parred.<eos> Fuck you lot, yeah?
That means a lot coming from you.<eos> Nine out of 12, 23.2 seconds.<eos> You're tied all the way up in tenth place.<eos> Tied with whom?<eos> That Buck fella, believe it or not.<eos> He came out of nowhere with his last couple of rounds.<eos> All right, Wild Card Wanda, come on up here, girl. - You're next.<eos> - Shot pattern is two sweeps and a loop.<eos> Ready when you are.<eos> I'm coming for you, you mangy bunch of curs!
That Buck fella, believe it or not.<eos> He came out of nowhere with his last couple of rounds.<eos> All right, Wild Card Wanda, come on up here, girl. - You're next.<eos> - Shot pattern is two sweeps and a loop.<eos> Ready when you are.<eos> I'm coming for you, you mangy bunch of curs!<eos> And hell's coming with me!<eos> 12 out of 12, 18.8 seconds.<eos> Think you can top that? All right.<eos> I'm coming for you, you mangy curs, and hell's coming with me.
So we're ahead of the curve.<eos> Help me, Zombie Wan Kenobi.<eos> You're our only hope.<eos> This doesn't change the fact that you still sicken me.<eos> Wouldn't be me if I didn't.<eos> I don't suppose you're here with a new batch of tainted Utopium.<eos> No such luck, Doc.<eos> Thanks for your help, Liv.<eos> I'll be seeing you.<eos> Uh... He'll be seeing you?
Mind giving us her home address?<eos> We'd like to follow up.<eos> Irina was undocumented.<eos> We paid her in cash.<eos> We're never gonna find her.<eos> Liv?<eos> She's still in the hotel.<eos> No way.<eos> You two go ahead.<eos> I'll meet you in the ballroom.
Hello?<eos> I-I have an OD. My friend OD'd.<eos> On Clark Street.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Want a drink?<eos> - Oh, no, I've had enough, I'll just...<eos> Oh, well, yeah, I'll have a Diet Coke.<eos> But what are you having?<eos> - Um, whisky. OK!<eos> - Yeah, OK, I'll have one of those. We thought we lost you to Elsa and Anna over there.
Give it back, Kenny! [Kenny growls]<eos> - Oh, you'll never get it now.<eos> - Bite down hard, Ken!<eos> Oh, man, that's the Nazi's house.<eos> He's gonna kill me!<eos> Who's a Nazi, Ben?<eos> You know, that German guy in that there house.<eos> Kids all say he's Hitler's little brother.<eos> Yeah, yeah, and he hunts down kids.<eos> Shut up, he's gonna hear you!
She took something from me, so I'm gonna take some things from her.<eos> I've always wanted this.<eos> That's c... cream.<eos> - Heavy, heavy cream.<eos> - Very heavy. Ooh. - Yeah.<eos> Okay, listen, honey, I understand that you're upset.<eos> I am, too, all right, but let's look on the plus side here, okay?<eos> Lark is so young, she's not gonna remember this.<eos> - Go knock down their tree. - Yeah, okay.<eos> I'm sorry. What? Well, we really did want to let you guys get some sleep, and we really did drive around, but I had to use the bathroom, so we came home, and I left your father for two minutes with the baby,
- You don't believe me. - I don't know.<eos> I mean, you seem like someone who plots out every move.<eos> - Which is not a criticism.<eos> Well, you're right.<eos> Normally I have everything all worked out, but, well, something about you makes me want to improvise.<eos> Bob, hey, I was just about to call you.<eos> Uh, I'm in the lobby.<eos> I'm early, I know, but whenever you're ready, no pressure.<eos> Uh, you know, I'm... I'm just not feeling well.<eos> I'm in bed, but you should go. - Take Dee Dee. - Well...
- It cost 180 bucks.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> Mm, I'm sure they buy them in bulk.<eos> So what were you saying?<eos> I want to hear all about your tie clip.<eos> Tie tack.<eos> It's the highest award given to only a select f...<eos> - Wow, this thing has two tapes!<eos> - How do they do that?<eos> Christ, you people don't even give a shit, do ya?
We was gonna be on Midnight Special.<eos> Oh, I thought we were gonna die before we got to wear our Nickel and Pickle costumes.<eos> - Costumes?<eos> - [shrieking] Get lost!<eos> [voice trembling] Hey, Jimmy. I like your costume.<eos> [stammers] Are you going as a hobo?<eos> These are my Sunday clothes, dick licker!<eos> They're from the Johnny Carson collection!<eos> And trick-or-treating is for femmes!<eos> If I catch you two dressing up tonight, I'll skin you alive and make your pelts into a comforter and I'll fuck your mom on it.
Oh, Sue! Yeah! - [Sue moaning] Oh, baby!<eos> From thy bounty through Christ our Lord, amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> Wow. Somebody's hungry tonight.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I had a hell of a workout before supper. [retches]<eos> - Shit!<eos> Jesus!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, so nice to see you, Craig, Lawrence.
Good job, Young-hee!<eos> Young-hee!<eos> - For you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> This might mean mo Olympic gold medals in our family!<eos> Young-sook will get a gold medal, but I'd be happy with a bronze.<eos> You're still in high school!<eos> Take it as an experience.<eos> You don't have to win any medals!<eos> I'm so proud of you girls.
Guess what I have!<eos> It's the last suit by the Italian designer Artobert Donjuane.<eos> This suit cost _150,OOO!<eos> It's begging you to wrap it around you!<eos> Don't you get it, guys?<eos> You can never make me change my mind!<eos> I'm not gonna use any of your filthy money.<eos> Honey, you'll never become a cop. You're wrong!<eos> I will become a cop!<eos> If you don't want me to arrest you, turn yourselves in!
I was sick of all of you!<eos> Do what you want with them.<eos> This is tragic.<eos> They wanna say something. Should we untie them?<eos> No way!<eos> They'll call all the dogs in the area!<eos> Dad, I respect any decision you make.<eos> You're my role model and subject of respect.<eos> This isn't the way I wanna arrest you.<eos> I'll let you go this time.

That's what turned our son like this.<eos> Let's hide out!<eos> We'll disappear for a few years, from Chul-soo and everyone else.<eos> Detective PARK wouldn't have a reason to catch us after his retirement.<eos> - What about our son?<eos> - Leave him to fate.<eos> If we can't even help him, might as well stay out.<eos> By the way... Before we hide out, we should repay PARK's family for letting us go last time?<eos> Repay them?<eos> I told you I'd catch you!
March!<eos> Congratulations!<eos> Here's to your first night!<eos> Thank you everyone!<eos> Wait!<eos> We're o_.<eos> Have a good time.<eos> - Good bye, mom and dad.<eos> - Have a great trip, sweetie.<eos> We'll visit you.
George Washington.<eos> Okay, Eva.<eos> Who was the first female Prime Minister of Norway?<eos> I'm not joining.<eos> She can't answer.<eos> - I do, I just don't want to join.<eos> - Just answer, then we won't nag anymore.<eos> I didn't hear the question.<eos> -Who was Norway's first female Prime Minister? Erna Solberg.<eos> Fuck you guys!
Fuck.<eos> What are they doing here?<eos> Hi!<eos> Wasn't it them who threw her out of the bus group?<eos> Wasn't it them who called you a slut?<eos> Don't go. I'll either get assaulted by Chris, or killed by those girls.<eos> Okay. I won't leave you.<eos> His goal was to get a girl pregnant, but then he found another solution.<eos> You're kidding!<eos> Is that why you're called the Penetrators?
- Hi!<eos> Is Jonas home? - Yeah, he's in the living room.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - What are you guys playing? - FIFA.<eos> What's up?<eos> What?<eos> Where's your Russ crew today?<eos> Don't you have a shitload to do?<eos> It's only two years and seven months until Russ time. You better start working. I know.

You better start working. I know.<eos> I'm really jealous of you guys, who spend their time on more constructive things...
Your lives could be in danger, but we're going to be strong if we stick together.<eos> Don't fight back. It's a non-violent movement.<eos> Non-violence is not passive. It's actually very strong.<eos> We shouldn't do this, John.<eos> This is not us. This is not SNCC. It's some bullshit.<eos> It's gonna do more for King and the SCLC than for Selma.<eos> This is Alabama.<eos> They can keep their asses in Washington, D.C.<eos> You don't tell us how to live our lives.<eos> This is an example of what you might deal with out there. What you might experience.
Prepare to die.<eos> Amphitryon!<eos> Amphitryon!<eos> The campaign ends here, for now.<eos> Chiron told me you took Egypt because they attacked our ships.<eos> That's right.<eos> But Argos, our neighbor, they presented no threat.<eos> I see Chiron has been expanding your Curriculum.<eos> I do not need a tutor to tell me when there's peace.<eos> I took Argos for you.
Has my mother spoken of this to anyone? No.<eos> I assure you, no one.<eos> Because the King is a jealous man... and most likely would believe this mad talk.<eos> Open the gates!<eos> Alcides!<eos> Hold!<eos> Have heart, my love!<eos> I will return before you know it!<eos> And you will be marrying me! Three moons from now!<eos> What troubles you?
Where you got him.<eos> Take this to the King.<eos> Captain, you are strong-willed... but this one, even half dead... he's twice as strong as my best fighter.<eos> If I thought you'd live, I'd sell you both for a princely sum.<eos> Sell us.<eos> Sell us!<eos> We will live.<eos> Who are you, soldier?<eos> Hercules.<eos> I cooled it off for you.
Yes.<eos> You are right.<eos> You have won yourself a fine bride.<eos> A bride, yes.<eos> But have I won a wife?<eos> She will serve you well.<eos> Is this my hope?<eos> Mother, how do I win her as my father won you?<eos> Please. I am not Alcides.<eos> I know that. To her or to you.
But have I won a wife?<eos> She will serve you well.<eos> Is this my hope?<eos> Mother, how do I win her as my father won you?<eos> Please. I am not Alcides.<eos> I know that. To her or to you.<eos> Your father won me but for a moment... which passed so fast I cannot remember.<eos> This is what you will have with Hebe.<eos> This is what has come of it. A marriage that she does not want... and the death of your brother.<eos> I paid good money for both of you.
How is the wagering?<eos> - How's the wagering?<eos> My friend, I doubt you have the imagination to even dream of it.<eos> For example, in the final contest, and that means... the richest contest, mind you... two men fight against six. Six that have never been beaten.<eos> Now, if they win, well, the two go free.<eos> But the odds would be against it.<eos> You'd find advantage in that, I'm sure.<eos> - But if they win--<eos> Tidy sum of gold in it for you.<eos> Why would I fight you two?
These three bumbling half-wits, or the rising rebellion at our doorstep?<eos> Majesty, they say Sotiris, Captain of Fourth Division, is back.<eos> He is leading the desertion.<eos> Father, I'll take responsibility for this.<eos> Let me find Sotiris. I'll make him lead us to Hercules.<eos> When our allies from Egypt, Germania, and the horn of Africa arrive tomorrow... Sotiris, Hercules, even Zeus himself will be but a memory.<eos> What is this place?<eos> - Captain Sotiris arranged it.<eos> This house will serve as safe haven, it would appear.<eos> The woman inside says she knows you.
- As Hercules.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I was present for the naming.<eos> My friend says you were of Argos until my father brought his wrath upon it.<eos> Your father brought wrath upon many... but Argos, that was a mortal's doing.<eos> Where have you brought me?<eos> - To the truth, Hercules.<eos> To the truth of you.<eos> You may claim your bride and ride a thousand days, it will not matter. Your destiny lies in something beyond.<eos> Yourjourney in life will take you farther from love... than you can imagine.
You must accept who you are.<eos> Only then can you unlock the doors to your own potential.<eos> Embrace your father, and you will discover... powers that you never imagined.<eos> Where was this father when 80 good men perished next to me?<eos> Where was he when my mother was murdered?<eos> Your father has always been there, Hercules.<eos> You were just not ready for him.<eos> Zeus can't change the minds of mortals... but he has given you a gift.<eos> And be warned, abuse it and it will lead to your destruction.<eos> Respect it, and it will save you and those you love.
Retreat!<eos> Do something!<eos> Stop him!<eos> Commissionaires!<eos> - Kill him!<eos> Get up.<eos> Get up.<eos> Come on.<eos> We stand with you, my Prince, as do the four divisions under our command.<eos> The people are ready to lay down their lives for you, Hercules.
Commissionaires!<eos> - Kill him!<eos> Get up.<eos> Get up.<eos> Come on.<eos> We stand with you, my Prince, as do the four divisions under our command.<eos> The people are ready to lay down their lives for you, Hercules.<eos> Lead us to victory!<eos> Brave men of Tiryns!<eos> I can only lead you through those gates!
Fire!<eos> We are with you, Hercules!<eos> Forward!<eos> King Amphitryon!<eos> Show yourself!<eos> Where are you, you coward!<eos> Hiding with your Prince?<eos> Hercules!<eos> I apologize for the Prince... but he's about to consummate his marriage to Queen Hebe... the future wife of the next king of Tiryns!<eos> And as for myself, well, I come to welcome you home.
Mom!<eos> She's speaking that stupid language again!<eos> Samantha!<eos> I was speaking perfectly clear English, Mother.<eos> He's a little slow in the head.<eos> He did officially flunk first grade.<eos> Sit your butt down!<eos> Yes, sir, Mother, sir!<eos> All right, listen up, guys.<eos> Grandma's gonna pick you up after school.
Bullshit.<eos> She took it all.<eos> All right, Randy, go cash this.<eos> Tell them I'm not feeling well or something.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mason, go with him.<eos> Here.<eos> There's my ID.<eos> Hi, good afternoon, fellas.<eos> What can I do for you today?
What?<eos> Does Garret have a condom?<eos> God!<eos> Dad!<eos> What?<eos> Come on.<eos> Sam, we have to be able to talk about this, all right?<eos> Come on, we do. We can do it, we can do it.<eos> Just stay with me here, all right?<eos> It's as hard for me as it is for you.
But we, the men, are going camping.<eos> The boys are going camping.<eos> All right, very nice.<eos> Well, we still on for tomorrow? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, I'll drop him off at 7:00 and then I'll just call you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Right?<eos> Great.<eos> It was really nice meeting you both.
Fuck, yeah, dude.<eos> You don't even have to play that well.<eos> You start playing your instrument, and they line up to give you blowjobs.<eos> Except for you.<eos> It doesn't impress the ladies so much when you play flute for the marching band.<eos> I'm not in the fucking marching band.<eos> Dude, you sure?<eos> I heard you play the skin flute.<eos> All right, I got a question for you guys.<eos> If you think you're so cool, why you hanging out with a bunch of 8th graders on a Friday night?

Fuck you, you little penis wrinkle.<eos> You're lucky to even be here.<eos> This is our camp-out.<eos> The only reason you little cum gums are here is because fucking Charlie's mom made him bring his little asshole brother and then he drags along you little dice danglers.
It's a good record.<eos> I shit you not.<eos> Cool.<eos> Hey, there, Cliff.<eos> Hey, how you doing?<eos> Good.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Hi, birthday boy!<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> It's great to see you. Yeah.
"Look at these nail prints.<eos> It's me."<eos> And Thomas says, "My Lord and my God, I believe."<eos> And Jesus said, "Well, that's good," "but blessed are those who can believe without seeing."<eos> It's a lot easier when you can see and feel and touch, but like us, we haven't seen him in the flesh, we haven't felt him in the flesh, but we have experienced him in the spirit.<eos> At least, I have, and I hope y'all have, too.<eos> The pond's right up here.<eos> It's low.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, my dad could take you fishing next time you're here if you want.
It means a lot to Annie and her folks, you know.<eos> Were we baptized?<eos> I wasn't the least bit concerned with the state of your soul.<eos> We can do it now, though, if you want.<eos> No, I think I'm all right.<eos> You and Cooper together, you know.<eos> Dunk your heads.<eos> You're not becoming one of those God people, are you, Dad?<eos> And what's that supposed to mean?<eos> I can hear you!
That's groundbreaking.<eos> She hasn't seen you in, like, 55 minutes?<eos> My God, most importantly,<eos> Meg's family just got a miniature pet pig.<eos> Okay, you're right.<eos> That is a really cute, tiny pig.<eos> Our lives can go on.<eos> I want one.<eos> Nice shot.<eos> Yeah, just give the lady at the front y'all's IDs and, she should let you in.
Yeah, yeah, just recently.<eos> What was her name?<eos> Sheena.<eos> She's gonna go to college with you?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> She's staying in this part of Texas. Okay.<eos> You need a ride to college?<eos> I just wanted to say hello before you got out of here.<eos> You guys met before, haven't you?
This is so cool.<eos> TYLER: Look at this candy.<eos> Here is where you make more Theopotamuses.<eos> [LAUGHING]<eos> My bad.<eos> What part of "not dating" does this bed fit into?<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> -Okay. You know what?<eos> Everybody fall into line.<eos> Brendan, Tyler honey, I need you on the couch.
We play traditional South African isicathamiya music with a little bit of American soul.<eos> [SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]<eos> - Ha-ha-ha!<eos> -[IN ENGLISH] It is getting a little hot in here.<eos> [WOMEN WHOOPING]<eos> Finally, my huge African arms are free.<eos> Yeah, baby!<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> No.<eos> I would like to welcome you to our Fourth Annual Blended Familymoon Week!
How long has she been like this?<eos> Since last evening.<eos> Come to me.<eos> Come to me.<eos> You must have known when you put me in that hole you couldn't hold me there forever.<eos> Gregory.<eos> If it is really you, then show yourself.<eos> Leave this innocent child!<eos> Mummy, what happened?<eos> God bless you.
Aim, Tusk, for God's sake.<eos> What is that?<eos> The bell.<eos> I'm being summoned.<eos> Tusk!<eos> Best make yourself scarce.<eos> Are you Gregory?<eos> That depends on who is inquiring.<eos> You are cordially invited to the walled city.<eos> The Inquisitor has instructed me to return you there now.
Their sense of smell, extraordinary!<eos> Jump.<eos> We seem to be having a Boggart problem.<eos> Much thanks.<eos> Don't worry, we are safe now.<eos> Boggarts, they hate water.<eos> Mr. Ward!<eos> Mr. Ward!<eos> Mr. Ward!<eos> On the subject of Boggarts, I'm beginning to find you a tad unreliable!
- You're a perfect mother. Hm...<eos> He told the courts that, um, she lacks a proper home and that it is beyond my capabilities as a single mother...<eos> Marry me.<eos> - Walter!<eos> I... - Shh.<eos> Don't think of a reason to say no, 'cause I've got a million reasons to say yes.<eos> - I know it makes no sense.<eos> - No, it doesn't...<eos> But just think of the fun we'll have!<eos> And I'm going to take care of you girls.
But I can't sue you, can I?<eos> You are the ultimate betrayal.<eos> You failed me with that painting!<eos> You crossed over from sentimentality to kitsch.<eos> Walter, stop it!<eos> You like making me look bad?<eos> You enjoy people laughing at me?<eos> Open up!<eos> Just let me in!<eos> I can see you!
You are the ultimate betrayal.<eos> You failed me with that painting!<eos> You crossed over from sentimentality to kitsch.<eos> Walter, stop it!<eos> You like making me look bad?<eos> You enjoy people laughing at me?<eos> Open up!<eos> Just let me in!<eos> I can see you!<eos> I'm gonna burn you out.
"Batting Practice"?<eos> Let's get a look at his swing.<eos> Take that gun and shoot that fucking dog, will you?<eos> She's cute, man.<eos> Is this your first- ask her if this is her first time.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> Uh, I'm in Houston, and everything's fine.<eos> I got a meeting in a little while.<eos> I'll call you later and let you know how it went.<eos> Yeah, there you go. Okay. Love you both.
We do have other customers.<eos> We were a lot cooler than we're making this seem.<eos> Right.<eos> Pete says, "How are you gonna dance?"<eos> - Look at my girls!<eos> - I'm glad I have it now!<eos> - Oh, my God, I need to see you.<eos> - I'm gonna cry!<eos> - Aw, my girls!<eos> Look at you! - Jeez.
"Signal's real bad.<eos> I only got, like, one bar in here."<eos> Your sister wants to do this.<eos> So, just zip it and go along.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Jesus!<eos> - Pete.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> It's just me.<eos> I heard you come in through the front.
- Ms. Zander.<eos> She's gonna be nice to me.<eos> She knows I was gonna help her<eos> - and now she's gonna be nice to me. - Calm down.<eos> You have to calm down.<eos> She's gonna keep her promises!<eos> She's gonna keep her promises!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> You have to break the connection or it will keep coming back for you.
Okay to go.<eos> Step it up.<eos> Viktor!<eos> Viktor, Viktor, Viktor.<eos> Tell me. Which would you rather?<eos> Pick one.<eos> Either you live in some miserable shithole, you have no money, but you're single.<eos> Or you're rich, you live in some fantastic apartment, but you have to be, good God, you have to be in a relationship.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - I'll leave the night to the two of you.
I hate this.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't want to be alone.<eos> I'm no good at it, you know that.<eos> Maybe some time apart will be a good thing.<eos> Well, it's got to be.<eos> Ok.<eos> I love you, daddy.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Love you too.
- How fucking dare you!<eos> - Calm down.<eos> What about this Swiss banker?<eos> Yeah, what about him?<eos> - I can't find him.<eos> - We're going to have to look a little harder then.<eos> No one's heard from him, Gary.<eos> This is crazy. This is nuts.<eos> The CIA can't take a piss without getting their dicks caught in their fly but they're absolutely fantastic at this.<eos> I mean, look at you guys.
Fresh start.<eos> Make room for something new.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for coming with me.<eos> It means a lot.<eos> Tonight's going to be a good night.<eos> Journalist of the Year<eos> Yeah. You ready?<eos> You look ready.<eos> - You guys behave.
And there he was on the roof.<eos> And Petrus was there with him.<eos> I had Overko stay and watch.<eos> That scientist finds anything, He'll get a knife in the back.<eos> Well? What should our next move be?<eos> Hear me, Sotnik. While you know this,<eos> The villagers are ready to act And execute the unholy.<eos> You want a requiem for your daughter, Master Sotnik? You'll have it.<eos> Wait here and see what happens.<eos> This is not a priest speaking With the power to punish and judge you. No.
Hallelujah!<eos> (Children shouting)<eos> Master Scientist, Go to Sotnik's house.<eos> You'll be safe there. You little pests! Go on!<eos> What did you see there?<eos> There's devilry here.<eos> You've joined them.<eos> You haven't been there!<eos> Do not consort with the scientist, any of you.<eos> Or the Lord's curse be upon you!
- Thank you, Pat.<eos> Well, there you have it.<eos> Who could argue with that?<eos> Which begs the question.<eos> Has the US Senate become pro-crime?<eos> Yeah, hi.<eos> No, no, 5000.<eos> Call me tomorrow.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Vallon's waitin' for you inside.
Come on, Jack.<eos> You're gonna like this.<eos> What the hell you doin' here?<eos> Y'all gonna play good cop, bad cop?<eos> Nah, Daniels.<eos> Bad cop, RoboCop.<eos> I've recovered 26 guns from Vallon's warehouse.<eos> Thirteen serial numbers match weapons missing from Evidence. And I got your prints all over 'em.<eos> This is bullshit.<eos> I also have CCTV footage of you and Vallon the same day he tried to kill me.
I need Sparta to join me.<eos> Give me your ships, Gorgo.<eos> I'll make sure that Xerxes wishes he never crossed the Aegean.<eos> You'll receive no Spartan ships.<eos> We've no interest in a united Greece.<eos> That is your dream, Themistokles, not ours.<eos> All I am concerned with is the preservation of Sparta.<eos> My guards will see you out.<eos> It's funny that you mock freedom here in your selfish isolation.<eos> Yet freedom, in her wisdom has chosen you to defend her.
My brothers.<eos> Steady your hearts.<eos> Look deep into your souls.<eos> For your mettle is to be tested this day.<eos> If in the heat of battle you need a reason to fight on an idea for which you will give up all that you will ever have you need only to look at the man who fights at your side.<eos> This is the "why" of battle.<eos> This is the brotherhood of men-at-arms.<eos> An unbreakable bond made stronger by the crucible of combat.<eos> You will never be closer than with those who you shed your blood with.<eos> For there is no nobler cause than to fight for those who will lay down their life for you.
Most of all, you fight for Greece!<eos> ALL:<eos> Greece!<eos> [ALL SHOUT]<eos> Yeah!<eos> And there is only one thing to make sure of when the fighting starts.<eos> What's that?<eos> Don't get killed on the first day.<eos> [MEN LAUGH]<eos> That goes for the rest of you.
Many heroic deeds occurred on that day.<eos> But it was 1 0 years ago and the facts of battle are often embellished.<eos> This deed, you would remember.<eos> I do what I must to defend Greece.<eos> And I do what I must to defeat her.<eos> For every one Greek killed, you must kill a thousand Persians.<eos> For every ship I sink you must sink a hundred.<eos> I can sustain losses for weeks.<eos> Months, if need be.<eos> My numbers will defeat you and I will take your precious boats with my sword.
Without Spartans, we're farmhands.<eos> COMMANDER 2:<eos> We should've negotiated with the Persians when we had the chance.<eos> You are all right.<eos> Yes, we are down to a handful of boats.<eos> And, yes, we are just farmhands.<eos> We are tradesmen.<eos> We are boys turned to men through the sacrifice and forge of combat.<eos> I played a dangerous game and I lost!<eos> If you choose to turn your back on me on your country I will not judge you.
A wind ofjustice.<eos> A wind of vengeance.<eos> MEN [lN UNISON]:<eos> Ah-ooh!<eos> Ah-ooh!<eos> Ah-ooh!<eos> [MEN continue chanting]<eos> [ARTEMlSlA GRUNTS]<eos> You are being surrounded.<eos> All of Greece has united against you.
I thought heroes fight for glory.<eos> But mercenaries fight for gold.<eos> Lord Cotys is a rich man.<eos> I like him already.<eos> If you agree to aid him, he will pay your weight in gold.<eos> Eat up.<eos> "A lion and crow in strange alliance."<eos> Told you.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> It is good to see you safe, My Lady.
We must not squander it.<eos> Are your gods going to be fighting with us?<eos> No.<eos> The son of Zeus will.<eos> I've seen how you watch over Hercules.<eos> Tell me, how did a woman, beautiful woman, fall in with these hardened men?<eos> Killers?<eos> Son of Zeus need a woman's protection?<eos> I don't protect him.<eos> I protect you from him.
Advance!<eos> Advance!<eos> Make way!<eos> Where is Rhesus?<eos> Lord Cotys.<eos> We came here to save this village, but, no, they killed half my army.<eos> Rhesus.<eos> This is all his doing.<eos> And yours.<eos> I warned you.
We call it the Blood Rage.<eos> This rage afflicted Hercules.<eos> He made me vow to keep the world away from him.<eos> To make sure that he would never harm innocents again.<eos> And that, My Lady, is the truth.<eos> The truth, whatever the truth, the death of his loved ones haunts Hercules.<eos> Only the gods can help him, if he listens.<eos> Come!<eos> Gather around, soldiers of Thrace, and behold, when Hercules gives an order, even the gods listen.<eos> Zeus' master ironsmith, using the forges of your own citadel, has crafted these divine weapons that will make you invincible.
You are extraordinary, my sons.<eos> Unlike anything the world has ever seen.<eos> Bound for greatness.<eos> Destined to protect the people of New York.<eos> A dark force is growing.<eos> A criminal organization known as the Foot Clan.<eos> So named because they step over the good people of this city with no regard.<eos> Their leader, The Shredder, will come at you with ferocity.<eos> His Foot Clan will outnumber you.<eos> The people of New York will look upon you as their only hope.
- Don't break it.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Please.<eos> How many times do I have to tell you? We don't break things, we fix them.<eos> Donnie already wiped the phone, genius.<eos> Problem solved, moving on.<eos> - And who put you in charge?<eos> - You know who did.<eos> Tension!<eos> It's been like 30 whole minutes since you guys had this argument.
- Here we go.<eos> Mr. Sacks, what sort of experiments are you doing here?<eos> That's a very complicated question.<eos> We're trying to change the world.<eos> Look at the camera!<eos> Hello, Splinter.<eos> And these are my little turtles, Leonardo,<eos> Raphael,<eos> Michelangelo and Donatello.<eos> The fans want to see you!
That he's not here, guys.<eos> That he's not here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fall in, quietly.<eos> Dude.<eos> So, guys, if it wasn't already obvious with that girl, dibs.<eos> If Master Splinter catches us, he'll send us back to the Ha'shi.<eos> I ain't going back to the Ha'shi.<eos> Every time we're in the Ha'shi, it's because of you.<eos> Well, bro, you won't have to worry about me dragging you down anymore.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm a talking turtle and you're a human nerd.<eos> Now that we got that out of the way, hit it.<eos> I've never been accused of being a nerd before, but...<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> How did you get in...<eos> How did he get in the...<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Let me look at you.
Hey!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Leo!<eos> About time.<eos> What the...<eos> Raphael.<eos> Glad you could join us.<eos> The fourth cage is for you.<eos> That's harsh, man.<eos> The rat did not teach you well!
Does anyone have anything they want to say?<eos> Donnie?<eos> I'm the one who licks the icing off the Pop-Tarts every morning and puts them back in the box.<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> I so did not understand the ending of Lost.<eos> Raph?<eos> I just...<eos> If this is our last moment together, I just want you guys to know I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I was so hard on you.<eos> Every time I pushed you, I...
I just...<eos> If this is our last moment together, I just want you guys to know I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I was so hard on you.<eos> Every time I pushed you, I...<eos> I threatened you, I yelled at you, I pushed you beyond your limits, it was because I believe in you!<eos> I believe in each one of you!<eos> I believe in your spirit and your intelligence and your potential.<eos> And every time I talked about walking away, it was because I was scared!<eos> I just didn't think I was good enough to stand next to you and call you brothers and say to you<eos> I love you!
He said, "Please get your knee off my chest."<eos> Sensei!<eos> You're alive!<eos> It worked!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This was all my fault.<eos> You were right.<eos> We weren't ready.<eos> No.<eos> It was I who wasn't ready to let you go.
It's the most we've seen of him in a few months.<eos> I know.<eos> Oh, my God, is he really opening up for The Shins?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When they play in Portland tonight.<eos> That's huge.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's kind of crazy.<eos> Everything he's ever wanted's actually coming true.<eos> I know you guys haven't been talking much lately.
Is that Mia?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's our little rock and roll.<eos> She was Nasty Bruises' original groupie.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Is he telling you old war stories?<eos> Hey.<eos> - We should probably go.<eos> - 'Kay.<eos> 'Kay, you kids be careful out there.
In some ways, it was just like a usual potluck dinner.<eos> But there was a special feel to it.<eos> People kept on showing up.<eos> All the old friends from Dad's band days and all the new ones from Adam's band.<eos> Willow and Henry were there with their newborn baby.<eos> Dad hauled the barbecue out of the basement and he and Teddy spent the day flipping burgers.<eos> And when it started to get dark Henry had the bright idea to start a bonfire.<eos> Mia!<eos> No way!<eos> I'm not playing for you guys.
And when it started to get dark Henry had the bright idea to start a bonfire.<eos> Mia!<eos> No way!<eos> I'm not playing for you guys.<eos> Not for us, with us.<eos> Seriously, Mia, if you don't, I will.<eos> And have you ever heard the sound of a thousand dying cats?<eos> Come on, Hall.<eos> We're playing together.<eos> I really hate you all.
You need to put a baby in that woman yesterday.<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> - Have you had your man parts checked yet?<eos> - Come on, not now, Wendy.<eos> Because you may have emptied them over the years.<eos> My room was next to yours.<eos> My room was next to yours.<eos> Well, this is great.<eos> I can tell it's gonna be a really good experience for all you guys.<eos> So I'm just gonna let you sit here for a bit.
CHARLIE:<eos> Take care.<eos> I'll see you guys soon.<eos> What's that?<eos> What are you writing?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, I'm just jotting down a few thoughts.<eos> - Oh, God help us.<eos> - Relax.<eos> It's not about you.
CHELSEA:<eos> You stop it. Stop it.<eos> Ha, ha.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You're like a magician.<eos> WENDY:<eos> You okay, there?<eos> TRACY:<eos> Yeah.<eos> I realize what this must look like to you all.
You could've talked to him.<eos> He'd have understood.<eos> How?<eos> He never failed at anything.<eos> That was kind of Dad's thing, wasn't it?<eos> Oh, God, Judd.<eos> Mort would've lost his business years ago if it hadn't been for my royalties and Paul coming in when he did.<eos> - Your father was a terrible businessman.<eos> He just figured if he had the store, you'd all come work there.<eos> He just wanted to be around you.
- Please.<eos> You didn't mean to.<eos> What'd you think you were gonna find down there, Annie?<eos> ANNIE:<eos> I'm sorry, Judd.<eos> I just--<eos> - I want a baby so badly.<eos> - Why don't you think about what you do have?<eos> You and Paul.<eos> You guys really love each other, don't you?
Your father was like family to me. And he died knowing your mother wouldn't be alone.<eos> Why didn't you tell us?<eos> You needed to mourn your father without any distractions.<eos> Uh, wait a minute, Mom.<eos> This whole shiva thing. It wasn't Dad's idea, was it?<eos> Smart boy.<eos> - Oh, Mom.<eos> - How could you lie to us like that?<eos> You wouldn't have stayed if I didn't.<eos> And I needed you all here.
Open your eyes!<eos> Open your eyes! Open your eyes!<eos> Open your eyes! Steven!<eos> Open your eyes!<eos> Stay with me.<eos> You did good tonight.<eos> From now on, you're in charge of collections.<eos> I'm not your brother.<eos> Speak English, motherfucker.<eos> Look, I just wanna see you guys stay alive, okay?
James, don't play with me like that, man.<eos> Hey, give me one.<eos> You're not a fiver?<eos> All right.<eos> Dude, yes.<eos> All right.<eos> So what are we working on today?<eos> Omar?<eos> How do you know about Omar?<eos> I overheard you guys talking about it at the station.
We all good for later?<eos> Yeah, it's all set.<eos> James!<eos> - What about that other thing?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> A kid named Runflat might have some intel on the Serbs.<eos> - Runflat?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That piece of shit.<eos> I'm putting cases on all you bitches.
This is a surprise inspection.<eos> So I suggest you all put a smile on your face, because today is the day that I finally decided to let you see mine.<eos> Welcome to me.<eos> Where's Jay?<eos> Oh, Jay?<eos> I left Jay ass at the pawn shop because he wasn't prompt.<eos> Everybody knows that I like my shit prompt.<eos> It's more professional that way.<eos> Ain't that right, my Serbs?<eos> I've been keeping tabs on all of you for some time now.
Yo, we can't go that way. Why?<eos> Because they got AK-47s down there.<eos> Two shotguns.<eos> They're probably Benellis.<eos> From the sound of it, it might be AR-15 as well.<eos> You can hear all that?<eos> It's from the game.<eos> I got a perfect recall.<eos> I'm a Platinum level player.<eos> Here you go! Huh?
Kind of makes it better ...and park the car.<eos> Friends, welcome to Cloud Cuckooland.<eos> Now....<eos> I just need to give the secret knock.<eos> [UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm just gonna come right out.<eos> I have no idea what's going on, or what this place is at all.<eos> Hi!<eos> I am Princess Unikitty and I welcome you all to Cloud Cuckooland.
How will we get inside?<eos> In a spaceship.<eos> -Spaceship!<eos> Ha, ha!<eos> -Great idea.<eos> A Bat-Spaceship.<eos> No, they're expecting us to show up in a Bat-Spaceship, or a pirate spaceship or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship.<eos> One of those sounds awesome to me.<eos> My idea is to build a spaceship that's exactly like all the other Octan delivery spaceships.<eos> So not the special spaceship that I'm building for all of you right now?
Beginning zapping termination in 99 Mississippi 98 Mississippi 97 Mississippi and so on.<eos> [MASTERBUILDERS YELLING]<eos> BUSINESS [OVER PA]:<eos> Attention, everyone.<eos> This is President Business.<eos> Hello.<eos> -Hi, welcome to Taco Tuesday!<eos> -Whoa.<eos> BUSINESS: Don't worry about this big black monolith thing that's blocking out the sun.<eos> What you need to worry about is this question that I'm about to ask you:
FINN:<eos> What?<eos> Now that I'm letting you come down here and play guess who else gets to come down here and play?<eos> -Who?<eos> -Your sister.<eos> What?<eos> Well, things sure have a way of working out smoothly. Am I right, guys?<eos> What?<eos> We're from the Planet Duplon.<eos> We are here to destroy you.
In the battle, a leader will be saved... and his savior will someday lead.<eos> Then the entrails should also say... that we will abandon reason... and be guided by omens.<eos> Great Sekhmet... Pharaoh drinks in your name... and prays for victory over the Hittites at Kadesh.<eos> Your first order of business when the time comes, you retire her.<eos> I will.<eos> I don't know why my father hasn't.<eos> But, just in case... if you see me in any real danger out there, ride the other way.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> When I look at you, I still see the two boys... who grew up together, close as brothers.<eos> If, for any reason... you ever forget that... let these remind you.
If you leave now, you'll just come back... because you know something's wrong. You've always felt it.<eos> Please.<eos> Everybody out.<eos> Out.<eos> The year of your birth... there was a prophecy that our leader would be born... to liberate us from our bondage.<eos> And so, there was an edict from Memphis... to kill every firstborn Hebrew boy.<eos> Your parents didn't wait for that to happen.<eos> Any chance of your survival was better than no chance. They handed you to your sister.<eos> She took you in a basket to the banks of the river... and she floated you to where she knew...<eos> Pharaoh Paramesse's daughter, Bithia, bathed. Bithia took you and your sister, Miriam, as a maid... and raised you as her own.
The truth?<eos> The truth is, it's not even that good a story.<eos> And I thought you people were meant to be... good storytellers.<eos> You, slave.<eos> You!<eos> Do you expect a reward for this information?<eos> Our reward is being of service to you.<eos> That said, if there were... some token you had in mind beyond that... we wouldn't refuse it.<eos> How about this, then?<eos> What about if I don't kill you?
We cross here!<eos> Ready yourselves!<eos> We cross here!<eos> Go tell them!<eos> Your orders... are like the lash of the Egyptian whip.<eos> We are no longer slaves.<eos> And yet, you are not free.<eos> You have lost sight... of Canaan... land of your forebears.<eos> You have honored me... with your trust.<eos> Now I honor you with my faith.
- You're not the man you once were.<eos> - None of us are.<eos> Go there.<eos> Go East!<eos> You know, I swore an oath to your father.<eos> My father is dead, you are released of your oath.<eos> I release you.<eos> - Father.<eos> - Papa!<eos> Hassan will escort you away from here.
- None of us are.<eos> Go there.<eos> Go East!<eos> You know, I swore an oath to your father.<eos> My father is dead, you are released of your oath.<eos> I release you.<eos> - Father.<eos> - Papa!<eos> Hassan will escort you away from here.<eos> I will see you again... very soon.
- Your brother is a great warrior.<eos> Now it's the time for peace<eos> That is my request of you.<eos> NFather, no one will follow me.<eos> They will because you will be King.<eos> Majesty, Prince Shing approaches the gates.<eos> Our time is less than we thought.<eos> Qiang Long, the royal seal.<eos> Yes, your Majesty.<eos> Qiang Long will escort you ensure that you all safely reaches the General Sen Ching Wen.
NFather, no one will follow me.<eos> They will because you will be King.<eos> Majesty, Prince Shing approaches the gates.<eos> Our time is less than we thought.<eos> Qiang Long, the royal seal.<eos> Yes, your Majesty.<eos> Qiang Long will escort you ensure that you all safely reaches the General Sen Ching Wen.<eos> I will protect him with my life.<eos> I have made none of these decisions lightly.<eos> Which is why... I have chosen you.
Be careful.<eos> Here.<eos> No money, no food.<eos> When you first came in, I thought you might be the White Ghost.<eos> I guess I was wrong.<eos> Is that the Princess?<eos> I seek an escort for the road.<eos> I can pay-<eos> What use is coin to the dead?<eos> The Black Guards are hunting you.
You should stay with us.<eos> I think my mistress would prefer to keep travelling.<eos> You're exhausted, and think of the children.<eos> I have private rooms, your mistress will appreciate the privacy.<eos> Waht are you looking at?<eos> You are hungrier than you appeared.<eos> Take my guests to clean up.<eos> They must be tired.<eos> Stay.<eos> I have something that may interest you.
- What happened?<eos> Let's go!<eos> - Hurry, this way.<eos> - Wait, our horses!<eos> You'll never pass the city gates.<eos> Go to the river and find a boat. Head downstream, wait for me at the Silver Mountain.<eos> - There are bandits!<eos> - I know, that's where I was going.<eos> - And you?<eos> - I'll meet you there.
General, Prince Qiang and Princess Lian are on the river headed toward the Silver M ountains.<eos> Go after them.<eos> Get to the shore!<eos> Run!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Let go!<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> Don't don't... hurts<eos> 900d<eos> It was my choice, I would have let you rot.
- My companions?<eos> - Safe!<eos> The Black Guards are as thick as flies on a fart ask because of you.<eos> You brought them here.<eos> How did you find me, lad?<eos> Nobody goes East.<eos> There is few of our kind beyond Baghdad.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - We have nothing to say.<eos> I should have left you in the woods.
You should be resting.<eos> I'm younger and healthier than you.<eos> I made a promise to my father.<eos> I swore to him...<eos> I'd protect Qiang with my life.<eos> But you why?<eos> I once looked for God in all of the wrong places.<eos> But you... your brother...<eos> It started to make sense again.<eos> My father would have liked you.
But you why?<eos> I once looked for God in all of the wrong places.<eos> But you... your brother...<eos> It started to make sense again.<eos> My father would have liked you.<eos> Ohhh, I don't know.<eos> I think your father would have taken my head.<eos> And rightly so.<eos> Perhaps to the man we first met.<eos> But you... he would have loved.
The Black Guards!<eos> GO!<eos> GO, MEI, GO!<eos> Go... get the boy... now!<eos> You want my blood?<eos> You want my BLOOD?<eos> The others?<eos> Oh, it's just Gallain.<eos> We have to leave, before more Black Guards arrive.<eos> I see you woman...
No more, Shing...<eos> HO more...<eos> Lia", no!<eos> Lord Shing is dead.<eos> "An<eos> - Sister!<eos> - I'll be all right.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> Of my country... zhao And Qiang...<eos> I love you...
But one day you'll know them.<eos> - Like, one day we'll...<eos> - Totally... Your band is really good you guys...<eos> - Yeah. - Thank you. You've seen us play?<eos> Someone here has seen you play.<eos> Colby.<eos> Colby is like, awesome.<eos> You know, Colby you should take them to come see us perform.<eos> Hey, Tyler, do you have a girlfriend?<eos> Uh, do I know you?
- No, he's...<eos> - I mean, I was a fat kid.<eos> - Οh, you were?<eos> - I was built like a damn tank, yeah.<eos> - She's seen the pictures.<eos> - It's pretty cute, though.<eos> I look like a... Just a little pillow with legs.<eos> - A little marshmallow.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, here's to you guys.
- The Grand Canyon's gotten so commercial.<eos> Arches has retained its essence, you know?<eos> It's just such a very, very spiritual place.<eos> Arches is rad.<eos> I actually road-tripped it down there spring break sophomore year.<eos> - It's insane.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> - A toast? A toast? I want to make a toast.<eos> To my beautiful, beautiful children, and to my lovely son-in-law.<eos> May the light embrace you with its energy infinite.
You know, Maggie, you asked me about the insight retreat.<eos> Guess where it is this year?<eos> Woodstock.<eos> Around the corner.<eos> - Οh, you've gotta be kidding.<eos> - I mean, it's such a...<eos> This just worked out perfectly.<eos> So that's why you came here?<eos> No, no.<eos> I came here to see you two.
So, how is life with the humans?<eos> Maleficent, I've come to warn you.<eos> They mean to kill you.<eos> King Henry will stop at nothing.<eos> Please, you have to trust me.<eos> They spoke of many things, and the years faded away.<eos> And she forgave Stefan his folly and his ambition, and all was as it had been long ago.<eos> You thirsty?<eos> What is this?<eos> I have avenged you, sire.
Child.<eos> King Stefan and the Queen have had a child.<eos> There will be a christening.<eos> They say it's to be a grand celebration.<eos> A grand celebration for a baby.<eos> How wonderful.<eos> All manner of folk came to the christening, even a trio of fairies who sought to foster peace and goodwill.<eos> Look, there's the baby!<eos> I love babies!<eos> Can you just concentrate, please?
You could live here now.<eos> Then I will.<eos> I'll sleep in a tree and eat berries and black nuts and all the Fair People will be my friends.<eos> I'll be happy here for the rest of my life.<eos> I'm going to tell my aunties tomorrow.<eos> Until tomorrow.<eos> I'm so excited!<eos> Aunties, I'm almost 16. I need a life of my own.<eos> No.<eos> I love you very much, but it's time to say goodbye.
Let's give a big round of applause for Christopher's father.<eos> Officer Willits!<eos> Great stuff, man!<eos> All right!<eos> All right! All right.<eos> Now, being a police officer is about more than kicking ass, car chases and guns.<eos> Yeah!<eos> All right.<eos> It's about protecting and serving your community.<eos> It's about making sure that Woodbury is a safe place for you all to work and play.
Thank you, all, so much.<eos> What's in a name?<eos> A glimmer of hope.<eos> A chance for change. That's right.<eos> A way to alleviate suffering.<eos> It's been five years since we launched Tranquiline.<eos> Correction. No, it's been a lifetime for those - who benefited from it.<eos> - Yeah. I'm getting emotional.<eos> To Marketing.<eos> I love you guys!
KATIE:<eos> (SIGHS) What are you doing out here?<eos> Huh?<eos> KATIE: Toby kissed me, Mum.<eos> ROSIE:<eos> Is that such a bad thing?<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Hey.<eos> Look, I...<eos> I was watching you two tonight. You're good together. You're a team.
I can't keep denying that you are here forever. There's only so much I can do without them asking questions.<eos> There can be political consequences.<eos> The woman in the photo, she is not your wife.<eos> And the girl in the next one, she is about the same age as your daughter.<eos> Okay. I'll try for two more weeks.<eos> But then you must leave for Laos.<eos> That works.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey!<eos> No running I said!<eos> I want to put in place a plan for you, my sons.
He's gone insane.<eos> He's on the south ramp.<eos> He went that way.<eos> You stay with Nung.<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> - Yes? - Tony.<eos> He at Baby Doll now.<eos> - We'll be there.<eos> - Okay, quick. I wait for you.
No?<eos> No one with a heart can do what you do.<eos> Blood money is still money.<eos> But nobody wants damaged goods.<eos> Viktor.<eos> Adieu.<eos> Tony! The kids!<eos> Listen, okay.<eos> You see those trees?<eos> I want you to run and hide behind them.
Not good.<eos> Almost forgot.<eos> You can't have armed prisoners.<eos> How is this a plan?<eos> Just what every dragon trapper needs.<eos> One end coats the blade in Monstrous Nightmare saliva.<eos> The other sprays Hideous Zippleback gas.<eos> All it takes is a spark, and...<eos> Yeah, there you go.<eos> Once they see you as one of their own... even the testiest dragons can be trained.
This is so great!<eos> Now you and I can go talk to Drago together.<eos> What?<eos> There's no talking to Drago.<eos> But we have to...<eos> No.<eos> We must protect our own.<eos> Come on, we should be getting back.<eos> Okay!<eos> Look, I got you here.
So what is your plan?<eos> Get Toothless back and kick Drago's...<eos> Heads up!<eos> And that thing.<eos> That's a good boy.<eos> Watch the furniture!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Your chief is dead.<eos> Stoick?<eos> No one can protect you now.
After gravity did its job, she'll buy herself new ones.<eos> How's your mom?<eos> She thinks that you're a hot hunk<eos> But it's hard for her to fall in love, because she's always thinking of Dad.<eos> I understand.<eos> Um... I thought you two live alone?<eos> We are.<eos> Papa is long dead.<eos> I'm sorry for you.<eos> I mean, for both of you.
Stop!<eos> - Faster!<eos> - Hold it!<eos> This way!<eos> - The keys! - Ha ha!<eos> Ah!<eos> What are you shouting for?<eos> You shouldn't be scared.<eos> I love children.<eos> I just wanted your parents to look after you better.
- Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Here.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> So, I saw Aaron go by.<eos> - I kicked him to the curb. - Mmm.<eos> When I saw your leg, I got everything out of my system.<eos> - Everything.<eos> - Thanks for that, by the way.<eos> I'm so glad you're both alive and not at each other's throats.
Or what worse.<eos> The key is useless, he can not turn around.<eos> I bet the lock only needs oil.<eos> Now you've Clancy flustered.<eos> He is determined barking for hours.<eos> I give him no matter what to eat, then he keeps his mouth.<eos> That would not be necessary if Mr Patterson would take care of the animal.<eos> Why are you at this time with me?<eos> Well, you said that your granddaughter comes over.<eos> So I thought, I cook something nice for you ladies.
I know something so well.<eos> Flesh is as the best.<eos> I need to eat meat.<eos> There are pills on the other hand.<eos> - The are not enough for me.<eos> That says my doctor.<eos> So old pans are not hard to get.<eos> I promise, I'll buy you a new one.<eos> I am so envious.<eos> You and Mabel, you have a girl's weekend just for you.
- Oh. You just dropped Bumble Bee.<eos> - You drop Bumble Bee?<eos> - I think he might be wet.<eos> No.<eos> Bumble Bee.<eos> There you go.<eos> Wish I could be there, bro, but I got prom tomorrow night.<eos> I thought that was next week.<eos> It is what it is.<eos> I'll probably be wiped out from my Peter Pan premiere... but I'll be happy to sing for you and all of your friends.
Okay, stop!<eos> It was my fault.<eos> I'm to blame for all of it.<eos> For everything.<eos> Yeah, see?<eos> I told you.<eos> No, hold on, hold on.<eos> Alexander, what are you saying?<eos> Okay, look.<eos> Last night I made myself a birthday sundae and I made a wish on a candle... and I think I cursed this day for all of you.
Now, you two be quiet and I'll tell you a story.<eos> What sort of story?<eos> The best sort.<eos> One filled with magic and fairies and savage pirates... called Never Never Land.<eos> Hi, hello!<eos> I'm a little boy named Peter Pan!<eos> - Hello!<eos> How are you? - What's wrong with her?<eos> It must be the cough syrup.<eos> So good to see you.
It's all good.<eos> It's all good.<eos> Dad... you don't always have to steer your ship with positivity!<eos> You keep us up and we really appreciate it.<eos> But some days are just bad.<eos> Nothing can fix it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I would know.<eos> At least we're all together now.<eos> It's my job to take care of you guys.
It's not a new thing. I've been thinking about it for a while.<eos> Imagine how cool it'd be to go somewhere where no one knows you, where no one knows who you are.<eos> You could even create a new personality!<eos> - Don't you like your personality?<eos> - Yes, I do!<eos> I'm not the problem.<eos> Excuse me. Gi.<eos> - Will you stay for dinner?<eos> - Please.<eos> - I'll call you guys when it's ready.
- Dad, you're always worried!<eos> If school had a camping trip, I bet you wouldn't let me go.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - What camping trip?<eos> There's going to be a camping trip, but I've been avoiding asking you because I know you'll complain.<eos> We just have to call the school and get the info.<eos> See, everything here is a huge drama!<eos> Son, it's a camping trip. We can't let you go with no information!<eos> It's not just about the camping trip, OK?<eos> It's about not being able to be home alone, having to tell you every step I take.
You're so good to me.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you so...<eos> He did what?<eos> Let me talk to him.<eos> He...<eos> He left.<eos> I'm going to call him.<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Look, I love you both.
- Money.<eos> - Listen, Mr....<eos> - Waxman.<eos> Norman Waxman.<eos> You got business, talk to our attorney.<eos> Excuse me...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You got a little success now, right?<eos> You got the records, the TV, the personal appearances.<eos> We're all very proud of you.
- Best I could do.<eos> - But what happens to the group?<eos> - I'll tell you what happens.<eos> Nothing. Why?<eos> Because it's still on paper that I own 25 percent.<eos> I got a better idea.<eos> A clean break. We buy him out.<eos> What?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You don't buy me out. I buy you out.
You're out here saving these adrenaline junkies that mean absolutely nothing to this department.<eos> I would take a bullet for those guys.<eos> Hmm. You'd take a bullet.<eos> Would you take 10 million bucks? Would you take $10 million?<eos> Where's the money?<eos> Don't fucking scream at me!<eos> - Where's the money?<eos> - You dumb fuck, you!<eos> Look at you! With your fucking 48% body fat. And, you, scrawny little bastard!<eos> - Fuck you guys!
The only way to be protected is to be completely honest.<eos> Yeah, well, if he said he'll show, he'll show,<eos> I mean, what more do you want?<eos> What I want is for you to give us more information of the activities of Senator Harrison.<eos> I can't speak to that.<eos> How would I know?<eos> Look, you got Luther spotters.<eos> Had it in 'im.<eos> Yeah, we're well aware of his activities.<eos> Yeah, listen, I don't mean to be disrespectful but what do they pay you guys for?
You talking to me?<eos> No, I'm Isabella.<eos> You two know each other?<eos> No. Not really.<eos> Yeah, my mistake.<eos> The gang's all here.<eos> Of all the gin joints...<eos> Delta, you look even younger now than you did that time in piccadilly when you played with those children.<eos> Remember? That was fun, wasn't it?<eos> It was really nice to see you all, but I gotta go.
-Hello? That's great!<eos> I'm so happy for you.<eos> And now you're happy.<eos> Now he's happy. You're always depressed with me.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Why is that?<eos> Who is that? I can't talk right now.<eos> Call me later. Was that the crazy blond? Or the needy father?<eos> Jane, I must talk to you!<eos> God, you know what? I'm so sick of both of you.
Miss Simmons, would you consider doing a commercial for us?<eos> And of course you can direct it, Mr. Simmons.<eos> It's Albertson. Thank you.<eos> Well, I guess I blew that one.<eos> I guess you did.<eos> Thank you, but I don't really do commercials.<eos> Not my thing.<eos> Did you want to find some large clothes?<eos> I said less tight... Yeah, but no, the relaxed or the more looser fitting are over here.<eos> Nice to meet you.
You don't understand, you've changed my life.<eos> I went to fashion school and I'm the executive buyer here...<eos> -Besides that... -Shut up... You gave me the single best night I've ever had!<eos> In bed and out. And it's all because of you and the Squirrels To The Nuts!<eos> Please keep your voice down!<eos> Okay, see you later, guys.<eos> My God, Seth Gilbert!<eos> So, you guys friends, Arnold?<eos> Where are you going with this, Seth?<eos> Now you two behave yourselves, okay?
Yes, that's what I was just saying.<eos> -I thought maybe we'd just sit down...<eos> -Fine!<eos> Let me just say something here before we get started.<eos> Look, we're all professionals here.<eos> Which isn't to say that we don't have problems in our private lives from time to time.<eos> Of course we do.<eos> But what makes us professionals is that we don't let those problems slop over into our work.<eos> And we can't talk about them in any way, shape or form.<eos> Use it for your performance, let it fuel that, But don't let it distract you from our purpose here.
Where's Jane?<eos> What?<eos> -Wilba, come back!<eos> -What the hell is going on here?<eos> I'll tell you what's going on here.<eos> You hired that hooker because she turns good tricks.<eos> Well, would you like some good tricks?<eos> 'Cause I got a bag full of them.<eos> Who wants to go first?<eos> I've got tricks on all of you!
Not too many fighters I would wait for, in my life, but he's won eight world titles, so I will wait for him.<eos> But that's how it goes.<eos> I can describe the schedule of Manny Pacquiao as hectic and erratic.<eos> You'll never know when we will be there...<eos> Of course there are a lot of things you are obliged to do.<eos> But sometimes I wonder can I do this? Can I really take this?<eos> It's frustrating at times, but you have to understand the time schedule that Manny creates for himself is unbelievable.<eos> There's times where the only sleep we get is while driving from one city to the next in the car.<eos> We wish you all the best of luck against Juan Manuel Marquez for the third time.<eos> All right then, thank you.
It all started when we were kids.<eos> They would give us these challenges.<eos> They were experimenting on us.<eos> And then people started disappearing.<eos> Every month, one after the other, like clockwork.<eos> They were sending them up into the maze.<eos> Yeah, but not all of us.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Guys, I'm one of them.<eos> The people who put you here, I worked with them.

Okay?<eos> I don't wanna have to cross any more names off that wall.<eos> You really think banishing us is gonna solve anything?<eos> No.<eos> But this isn't a banishing.<eos> It's an offering.<eos> What? Wait!<eos> Gally, what are you doing?<eos> You really think I'm gonna let Thomas back into the maze after what he has done?<eos> Look around you!
The door opened!<eos> Seriously?<eos> What happened here?<eos> So they were watching us.<eos> This whole time.<eos> Hello.<eos> My name is Doctor Ava Paige.<eos> I'm Director of Operations of the World Catastrophe Killzone Department.<eos> If you're watching this, that means you have successfully completed the Maze Trials.<eos> I wish I could be there in person to congratulate you... But circumstances seem to have prevented it.
In time, a new generation emerged that could survive the virus.<eos> Suddenly, there was a reason to hope for a cure.<eos> But finding it would not be easy.<eos> The young would have to be tested, even sacrificed... inside harsh environments... where their brain activity could be studied.<eos> All in an effort to understand... what makes them different... what makes you different.<eos> You may not realize it... but you're very important.<eos> Unfortunately, your trials have only just begun.<eos> As you will no doubt soon discover, not everyone agrees with our methods.<eos> Progress is slow, people are scared.<eos> It may be too late for us... for me... but not for you.
Just do it by yourself like that.<eos> Nobody had any.<eos> Everybody was desperate and suffering lapses of judgment.<eos> Eight-4-2-9-3.<eos> - It's a phone number!<eos> - One-2-5-0-1.<eos> It's ringing.<eos> Howdy, dopers.<eos> We've got whatever you need.<eos> And remember: the sooner you get over here, the more there 'll be left for you.
It's ringing.<eos> Howdy, dopers.<eos> We've got whatever you need.<eos> And remember: the sooner you get over here, the more there 'll be left for you.<eos> So come on down to 4723 Sunset Boulevard.<eos> You better hurry.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry, who is it that I'm talking to?<eos> - She hung up.<eos> - Let's go!<eos> She's screaming at you:
Submissive, brainwashed, horny, little teeners who do exactly what you want before you even know what that is.<eos> You don't have to say a word out loud.<eos> They get it all by ESP.<eos> Your kind of chick, Doc?<eos> You the one that's been stealing my magazines?<eos> What would Charlie do?<eos> Well, probably not this.<eos> Listen, I'm sorry about Mickey.<eos> Mickey.<eos> Mickey could have taught all you swinging beach bums a thing or two.
I don't know what you're saying.<eos> It's something Jamie and Darby are doing.<eos> Since when do you guys do two things in one night?<eos> - You never go anywhere. - We go anywhere.<eos> We have to get back for the sitter.<eos> Scratch that, we want to get back.<eos> I hate being away from her.<eos> - The sitter?<eos> - Yeah. It's true.<eos> We've lost you to the baby.
And then all the other times she wakes up.<eos> That's okay.<eos> How is she?<eos> Cool baby. But, to be honest, it's a little hard for me to relate to an infant.<eos> It seems kind of cool though.<eos> It's like the pregnancy is its own thing.<eos> After a while, I just felt like, we did this, we don't actually need the baby.<eos> I'm sorry if I've appeared crazy or...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry we didn't invite you to the party.
What makes you think I can handle a bunch of them?<eos> You just keep a bunch of them for a short period of time and then you send them out into the world to flourish.<eos> Like college kids.<eos> Yes.<eos> Or like capitalism.<eos> And then you replenish the team.<eos> Think of a roster like a spiritual and physical...<eos> Mostly physical.<eos> ...rejuvenation of the male soul.<eos> Which you guys clearly don't fucking have.
Except for everything about it.<eos> I gotta get home.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yours, it is.<eos> You're one hell of a negotiator.<eos> This kind of stuff just rolls off your tongue doesn't it?<eos> I'm just trying to make you laugh.<eos> I don't like how well it's working.<eos> Fuck...<eos> Wait, so you guys still haven't gotten Mikey laid?
You get all precious with this stuff and you throw down, and slap me in the mouth.<eos> Whenever you start losing, you just get upset.<eos> Dude, did you just take another shit in there?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Every time.<eos> Why do you care so much about what I'm doing in there?<eos> I wasn't taking a shit.<eos> You're so disgusting.<eos> Dude.<eos> Why do you guys care so much what I do in the bathroom?
Don't buzz her in, man.<eos> We're having such good guy time right now.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I just buzzed her in.<eos> He fucking buzzed her in.<eos> Okay.<eos> He buzzed her in.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Both you guys need to calm down.
Because we had a deal.<eos> - We were staying single.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Single?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> We'll talk about it later.<eos> I didn't go to a funeral.<eos> You both lied to me<eos> I did that for you.<eos> I did that for both of you.
Go on. - You know I'm sorry, don't you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You do. You know I'm sorry.<eos> What, no kisses this time?<eos> Not with that around your faces, no?<eos> I was gonna tell you, mate, but I just had to let Tony see it...<eos> - Why, what's the problem?<eos> - It's not good news, Tony.<eos> No one has any money.<eos> Of course, they have. It's just you two are not getting it.
All those in favor of banishment, raise your paws.<eos> Shiny.<eos> State line is just passed this dam.<eos> Then we are home free.<eos> You're the thief.<eos> Not Surly.<eos> He was right about you.<eos> - Hey...<eos> - No. There's dynamite back there.<eos> Alright boys, we've got you completely surrounded.
We have this...<eos> Yeah. You know, we should have some fun.<eos> I need some fun.<eos> I'll walk Pacino.<eos> Here, boy.<eos> Hey, Danny!<eos> - Over here!<eos> - Bernie!<eos> Come over here!<eos> I got shots for you over here!
- You got him started.<eos> - I give it two months.<eos> Hey, before we drink, so, like, what are we talking about with you being out?<eos> - No rush.<eos> - But let's put a number to it.<eos> It's the 10th, so you're talking 13...<eos> - This month has 30 or 31... - Thirty-one days.<eos> - That's gonna be crazy.<eos> - If it's 13, it's okay.<eos> - To you guys!
Yeah.<eos> You're a liar.<eos> Why are you lying to me?<eos> Everybody knows you keep it for yourselves.<eos> So, why don't you just admit it?<eos> I'm talking to you.<eos> Are all you stiffs deaf, or somethin'?<eos> Beatrice... don't.<eos> One hundred years ago, after the war... our founders created a system they believed... would prevent future conflict and create lasting peace.<eos> Today, aptitude testing based on your personality... will assign you to one of the factions.
It's an old accusation.<eos> That he mistreated his son... and that's why the boy defected.<eos> Is that true?<eos> No.<eos> 'Course not.<eos> Children defect for all kinds of reasons.<eos> Don't take too long, in here.<eos> You need a good night's sleep...<eos> For tomorrow.<eos> I, um... We love you.
To do what?<eos> There's no going home to your families... so, you'd live Factionless.<eos> Why didn't we know that?<eos> It's a new rule. A new rule? Somebody should have told us that.<eos> Would you have chosen differently?<eos> Out of fear?<eos> I mean, if that's the case, you might as well get out now.<eos> If you're really one of us... it won't matter to you that you might fail.<eos> Now, you chose us.<eos> Now we get to choose you.
You've got three options.<eos> Hang there, and I'll forget your cowardice.<eos> Fall and die.<eos> Or, give up.<eos> But if you give up, you're out.<eos> Come on, Chris!<eos> Time!<eos> Dauntless never give up.<eos> As Dauntless, we fight to protect every life inside the fence... without fail.<eos> That's why we train you the way we do.
Congratulations... new members of Dauntless.<eos> Dauntless!<eos> Dauntless!<eos> Come on.<eos> Get in line.<eos> All right, everybody, line up.<eos> What's going on?<eos> All Dauntless initiates... report to your command leader.<eos> All right, listen up!<eos> Before you leave tonight, I want you all in four lines.
Right there! Don't move!<eos> Drop your weapons.<eos> Tobias Eaton.<eos> And you, Beatrice.<eos> I thought it was intellect I was sensing in you.<eos> Maybe you're not as smart as you think you are.<eos> Why are you attacking all these innocent people?<eos> Innocent people?<eos> Abnegation, if left unchecked, will destroy the faction system.<eos> Same can be said of both of you.

Rogers, Steven, born 1918.<eos> Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna, born 1984.<eos> It's some kind of recording.<eos> I am not a recording, Fräulein.<eos> I may not be the man I was when the Captain took me prisoner in 1945.<eos> But I am.<eos> You know this thing?<eos> Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull.<eos> He's been dead for years.<eos> Firs! correction, I am Swiss. Second, look around you.
There's something I want to show you.<eos> Let's go get Marty and Luke.<eos> Chris.<eos> Gentlemen, welcome to the loft.<eos> Wow.<eos> This is impressive, Vince.<eos> Check out the view.<eos> Then imagine this is our own private oasis right in the heart of downtown.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - A place where no one hassles you.

Where were you... when Zoe and I were getting beat up?<eos> And Mom in the next room pretending not to hear.<eos> In your cozy college dorm getting laid and wasted - 'cause you didn't give a fuck!<eos> - I didn't know anything about it.<eos> You didn't give a crap!<eos> All those years we didn't exist for you!<eos> I didn't know anything about it!<eos> If you would've told me or said something...<eos> Then what, you phony? Then what?<eos> Then I would've gotten you out of there, goddamn it!
I'm just finding a better place for it.<eos> I'm gonna take one last look and I'm gonna put it where it belongs.<eos> It's easy to feel hopeful on a beautiful day like today.<eos> But there will be dark days ahead of us too.<eos> There will be days where you feel all alone.<eos> And that's when hope is needed most.<eos> No matter how buried it gets or how lost you feel you must promise me that you will hold on to hope.<eos> Keep it alive.<eos> We have to be greater than what we suffer.<eos> My wish for you is to become hope.
What do you want?<eos> - We need your help, Peter.<eos> - For what?<eos> To break into a highly secured facility... and to get someone out.<eos> Prison break?<eos> That's illegal, you know.<eos> Only if you get caught.<eos> So, what's in it for me?<eos> You, you kleptomaniac, get to break into the Pentagon.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?
Banshee.<eos> Mutant brothers and sisters... all dead!<eos> Countless others... experimented on.<eos> Butchered!<eos> Erik!<eos> Where were you, Charles?<eos> We were supposed to protect them!<eos> Where were you when your own people needed you?<eos> Hiding!<eos> You and Hank! Pretending to be something you're not!
The President of the United States.<eos> My fellow Americans... today we face the gravest threat in our history... mutants.<eos> We have prepared for this threat.<eos> In the immortal words of Robert Oppenheimer...<eos> "Behold.<eos> The world will never be the same again."<eos> Can I help you?<eos> No, you can't.<eos> Here they come.<eos> This is for you, brothers and sisters.
Now, what have I told you about...<eos> Sorry, what?<eos> It looks like some sort of giant laser sent to kill us all, sir.<eos> Another one!<eos> No!<eos> What the...?<eos> Naughty, naughty!<eos> Pretty birds belong in their cages.<eos> Now, that's just hurtful.<eos> And I was so happy to see you again.
Go ahead, Dan.<eos> Continue.<eos> You seriously don't remember me?<eos> Dave!<eos> Dave!<eos> Right!<eos> Oh, yeah, long time!<eos> How's the wife?<eos> I've never been married!<eos> You may not remember me... but I could never forget you.
Oh, it was.<eos> I came to realize, some creatures are born to get all the love.<eos> The rest of us get nothing.<eos> The only thing that has kept me going all these years... is my burning thirst for revenge!<eos> And my precious souvenir snow globe collection.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Daryl, Daryl, Daryl, you can't blame us for what happened to you.<eos> Can!<eos> That's how this whole revenge thing works!<eos> And with this, I finally have the power to destroy you!
You?<eos> You didn't steal that!<eos> It's over.<eos> It's over?<eos> Then why did I call you?<eos> Weird.<eos> Oh!<eos> Maybe it was to show you this!<eos> That is a lot of serum for four penguins.<eos> Oh, you thought this was just about you four?
God, imagine the guilt.<eos> The regret.<eos> The feeling that, I don't know... that it should have been you.<eos> All for penguin plan.<eos> All for North Wind plan.<eos> His...<eos> His is better.<eos> What?<eos> I'm sorry, boys.<eos> But I can't lead you this time.
Sir, the sub didn't explode... and I fear the fireworks... may have been a tactical mistake.<eos> Stay calm!<eos> Do not panic!<eos> We will still Win!<eos> Be full of love! Don't hate!<eos> Follow your dreams.<eos> Love yourself.<eos> Love other people.<eos> Pick and choose your battles in life!<eos> Don't let anyone tell you what to do.
He's gonna turn us into monsters!<eos> Yepper-doo!<eos> And what comes next, Dave?<eos> Invasion!<eos> Horrible mutant penguins, unleashed on the streets of New York City!<eos> You're the monster!<eos> Yes!<eos> I'm the monster.<eos> Everyone made that clear to me every day of my entire life.<eos> But let's see how much everyone loves you when you're the monster!
Yeah!<eos> Yay!<eos> Your new... and improved...<eos> Penguins!<eos> Penguins!<eos> Penguins!<eos> Penguins!<eos> Penguins!<eos> Penguins!<eos> The people love you.
Your new... and improved...<eos> Penguins!<eos> Penguins!<eos> Penguins!<eos> Penguins!<eos> Penguins!<eos> Penguins!<eos> The people love you.<eos> Just go give them a hug!<eos> Don't let them touch you!
Penguins!<eos> Penguins!<eos> Penguins!<eos> Penguins!<eos> The people love you.<eos> Just go give them a hug!<eos> Don't let them touch you!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Nobody likes you anymore?
What a run!<eos> O'Malley did it. He made it!<eos> What a run!<eos> Ryan O'Malley has just delivered one of the greatest...<eos> But I knew I could beat the outside.<eos> This has been a stellar performance by O'Malley... the young player who we're hoping to see a lot of in the future...<eos> O'Malley!<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> Oh! Everybody's here!<eos> Great to see you guys!
The lingo's half the fun.<eos> We're here.<eos> We got reports of a 418.<eos> What?<eos> Why don't you tell them what a 418 is?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Tell them.<eos> And I gotta say, you look suspicious, buddy.<eos> Hands where I can see them.<eos> All of you.
I'm sorry, Sergeant.<eos> I didn't see the stripes.<eos> We've been getting a lot of calls about stolen cop cars.<eos> I'm Officer Segars, this is Officer Jackson.<eos> Sorry, Sergeant, we should have called it in first.<eos> Well, goddamn it, guys!<eos> Don't let it happen again, all right?<eos> That's amateur hour.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yes, sir. Look, I don't mean to scold you.
Dude, no!<eos> We're Code 6. Let's go.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're getting their six.<eos> No, we're not!<eos> Wanna take the lead on this, Sarge?<eos> Me?<eos> No, you guys go ahead.<eos> I'm gonna evaluate you guys, individually and as a team.
It started out just as fun... but now we're in a lot of trouble and we need help.<eos> From real cops.<eos> Hold on a second there, Angie.<eos> Don't believe a word these guys say.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> These guys are a couple of real jokers!<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You guys came down here to help me fill out all that paperwork... you ditched us with the other night, am I right?<eos> That's right, yeah.<eos> No. Good to see you guys again.
There's men already there.<eos> You need to take Maisey and run.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> What men?<eos> - Mom...<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - They're there.<eos> Everly, what have you gotten us into?<eos> Mom, you got to get out of the house right now with Maisey, or they're going to kill you both.
Are you sick?<eos> I am, but singing always makes me feel better.<eos> Itsy bitsy spider<eos> Crawled up the waterspout<eos> Down came the rain<eos> And Flushed the spider out?<eos> - You're funny.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I did not want you to get involved in this.<eos> I did everything I could to protect you.
No, thanks.<eos> Gotta run.<eos> Do you really think Webster can fix our records?<eos> Expunging of adverse, commence... or contents. That's how it's put.<eos> What do we have to do?<eos> All I can say is... We'll be doing what we're trained to do in a hostile situation.<eos> And those guys who choose to stay... Will be fully briefed tomorrow.<eos> Webster, that same puto that nailed our coffin.<eos> If it means to clear our name... I'm in.<eos> I get it, that's fine for you three.
Perhaps you have a cigarette?<eos> You can speak Russian?<eos> It's so cold in here.<eos> There are so many rats, I'm afraid.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Grab the AK.<eos> I need to see it.<eos> Let's blast this bitch.<eos> You bastard!<eos> I had to kill you, but I didn't.
Whenever you're ready.<eos> People of Panem, we fight! We dare to end this hunger for justice.<eos> And that, my friends, is how a revolution dies.<eos> Hello, Katniss.<eos> This how you greet an old friend?<eos> Maybe I don't recognize you sober.<eos> I guess it looks as bad as it feels.<eos> People of Panem, we fight! We dare! We end this hunger for justice!<eos> Madam President, indulge me for a moment, if you would.<eos> Let's everybody think of one incident where Katniss Everdeen genuinely moved you.

We dare! We end this hunger for justice!<eos> Madam President, indulge me for a moment, if you would.<eos> Let's everybody think of one incident where Katniss Everdeen genuinely moved you.<eos> Not where you were jealous of her hairstyle or her dress went up in flames or she made a halfway decent shot with an arrow.<eos> And not where Peeta made you like her.
She cannot be coached into it. Trust me, I know.<eos> Maybe there's someplace that's less dangerous.<eos> District 8.<eos> They reported heavy bombing last week.<eos> There are no military targets left.<eos> We can't guarantee her safety. You'll never be able to guarantee my safety.<eos> - I wanna go.<eos> - And if you're killed?<eos> Make sure you get it on camera.<eos> I've made you some surprises.
Hey. - Hey.<eos> Let's see what you can do.<eos> Be careful.<eos> - This is my assistant, Messalla.<eos> - It's an honor to meet you.<eos> - And your cameramen over there, Castor.<eos> - Hello.<eos> And Pollux.<eos> Let's get locked in.<eos> You're all from The Capitol? Plutarch got you out?
If you can come up with another, I'm all ears.<eos> It's right through here.<eos> Don't film me in there.<eos> I can't help them.<eos> Just let them see your face.<eos> - Yeah. - You all right?<eos> It's okay. Here, it's okay.<eos> Katniss Everdeen?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I came... I came to see you.
Beetee's inside their system now, wreaking all kinds of havoc.<eos> A window is open to us.<eos> How much longer? I don't know.<eos> I guess until The Capitol can get the power back on.<eos> And President Coin?<eos> You know, I can never fully support that woman in light of the... prohibition they have going on around this place, but...<eos> Plutarch got word that Peeta and the others are in the Tribute Center.<eos> And with the power out, Coin sees this as an opportunity.<eos> She knows that Peeta is The Capitol's weapon. The same way you're ours.<eos> And as opposed to having you two pointing at each other, she's going to get him.
Masks on.<eos> See, I know all the depravity, the deceit and the cruelty of The Capitol's pampered elite.<eos> But the biggest secrets are about our good President, Coriolanus Snow.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Command, this is Team Leader.<eos> Prepare to deploy gas.<eos> We will confirm once inside.<eos> Such a young man when he rose to power.<eos> Such a clever one to keep it.<eos> How, you may ask, did he do it?
Is that it? No?<eos> RedTube?<eos> - Bang bros?<eos> - No.<eos> - BangBus?<eos> - No.<eos> BigBoobAlert?<eos> - You with BigBoobAlert?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Where you from, then?
It is great of you.<eos> Internet porn gets a bad rap in some circles, but it's not deserved.<eos> I'm always tellin' people this.<eos> YouPorn is a community.<eos> A safe, supportive place where people can go to display videos of themselves ass-fucking each other.<eos> That's really nice.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> I think so.<eos> But let me ask you something.<eos> Why'd you make the video in the first place if you didn't want anyone to see it?
We have to go.<eos> Now.<eos> Up the hill.<eos> Run.<eos> We can't go there.<eos> We have no choice.<eos> Hurry!<eos> Hold, men! Hold!<eos> The giants!<eos> They'll kill you!
To wrap you in His sheltering wings And whisper you to sleep<eos> Your Father is<eos> The healing wind<eos> That whispers you to sleep<eos> That whispers as you sleep<eos> It's an ugly wound.<eos> She'll never have children.<eos> If the fever doesn't take her, I think she'll live.<eos> Follow me.<eos> I'm sorry I frightened you.
Maybe we'll learn to be kind.<eos> Will he come back?<eos> Some things cannot be unbroken.<eos> I have to know...<eos> Why did you spare them?<eos> I looked down at those two little girls, and all I had in my heart was love.<eos> Then why are you alone, Noah?<eos> Why are you separated from your family?<eos> Because I failed Him.<eos> And I failed all of you.
Be a father.<eos> Be a grandfather.<eos> Help us to do better this time.<eos> Help us start again.<eos> The Creator made Adam in His image, and placed the world in his care.<eos> That birthright was passed down to us.<eos> To my father, then to me, and to my sons,<eos> Shem,<eos> Japheth, and Ham.<eos> That birthright is now passed to you, our grandchildren.
(swallows)<eos> Alright.<eos> Thanks for the watch.<eos> (clears throat)<eos> OK.<eos> I'm standing here with my brand new Rolex.<eos> A little gift from my new friend here next to me.<eos> Right?<eos> Although he is with regard to his personal hygiene, something sloppy, and he isn't even right now Very much talkative currently.<eos> Nevertheless,I you like living would acquainted with him.
- Maybe four.<eos> We can't hang around Athens that long.<eos> Can you bring the passports to one of the islands?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How much trouble is he in?<eos> Niko, he'll pay us.<eos> We can make a lot of money.<eos> For another $1,000, he can deliver the passports to Crete.<eos> Crete?<eos> Yeah, no one's going to look for you there.
For another $1,000, he can deliver the passports to Crete.<eos> Crete?<eos> Yeah, no one's going to look for you there.<eos> That's...<eos> I mean, I don't know Crete from a hole in the ground. Where am I...<eos> Are you joking?<eos> This guy hasn't got a clue.<eos> I'm kidding... - This is bullshit.<eos> - I'm not getting involved. - What's the matter?<eos> No, no, no. I should come with you. - What?

It's just, uh, different pronunciation, but it's the same thing.<eos> But it is confusing.<eos> Who knew?<eos> - Where did you live?<eos> - On Hudson and 11 th.<eos> I shared an apartment with three Barnard...<eos> I'm fading. I don't know if I can stay up much longer.<eos> Well, order some coffee.<eos> I think I might have another Scotch.<eos> So how did the two of you meet?
I'm gonna throw up.<eos> I can't...<eos> Right there.<eos> Yeah, yeah!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Do you guys want to see something amazing?<eos> Yes, I want to see something amazing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is it?<eos> I know you're all wondering why I brought you here.
Fuck, they're coming up the driveway.<eos> Shit, they're coming.<eos> Shit.<eos> They're right there.<eos> - Just go, you answer it. - You answer it.<eos> You answer! You are gonna answer.<eos> You do it. You do it.<eos> You do it.<eos> We're just getting dressed! I'm naked!<eos> No, I see you guys right there.
No noise complaint.<eos> You know the boy who cried wolf?<eos> You're that boy.<eos> Okay, I cried wolf.<eos> Never call us again.<eos> Never call you again?<eos> You're the fucking police.<eos> Look, man, we're sorry.<eos> You were being noisy.<eos> We tried to call you. I don't know what to say.
I'm gonna act all docile and then... My claws are out! I'm gonna fucking get them!<eos> Fuck these fucking guys!<eos> They don't know who they are fucking with.<eos> They think I'm just a regular dad and then you know what happens?<eos> Boom!<eos> Boom!<eos> Teddy's dead!<eos> Pete's dead!<eos> Scoonie's dead!<eos> Fuck you!
Yo.<eos> I've been waiting forever.<eos> Yeah, glad you made it. Whoa, whoa!<eos> What is she doing here?<eos> Wait. What is he doing here?<eos> Look, we're friends with both of you.<eos> Fucking just learn to deal with it, okay?<eos> This is an abomination.<eos> You...<eos> Right now, both of you have to make a choice right now.
Just a little taste, a little taste.<eos> That was sexy.<eos> Can I make out with someone now?<eos> What are you doing? We have 60 seconds before they go upstairs.<eos> Get in the dance circle.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I'm winning, by the way.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> - Shit!<eos> I think Teddy saw you.
Like the cat.<eos> My father...<eos> Yeah.<eos> "I hate Mondays!" "I hate Mondays!"<eos> "I love lasagna!"<eos> Do some cat stuff real quick.<eos> Be sarcastic or lick yourself.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> I love fucking with you when you high, man.
No!<eos> No!<eos> I got it, I got it. I got it.<eos> Four-twenty?<eos> Victory.<eos> Boom! Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes. I'm gonna kill you.
You give this task to me?<eos> You defeated Bohan's assassins today.<eos> Your skill surpasses the best of my clansmen.<eos> It's true you are no heavenly warrior, but as Takashi said, clearly you are no kitten.<eos> Take the sword, Nariko.<eos> Keep your ego in check.<eos> Remember your chores, your challenges.<eos> I will lead our people east. Bohan will follow.<eos> You, Nariko, will take the sword west. Father, no.<eos> They'll destroy you.
I am not the chosen one.<eos> You must never do that again.<eos> You understand?<eos> - I know what I'm doing. - Hush!<eos> Don't ever let me do that again.<eos> Now, how do we get you all out of here?<eos> Don't be a fool.<eos> Bohan's returning.<eos> Just leave us. You have a job to do.<eos> First we're getting you off this rock, then you're on your own.
The guards will protect her, right?<eos> They're here to stop us from getting out.<eos> They don't care what we do to each other inside.<eos> Whatever nightmares the future holds, are dreams compared to what's behind me.<eos> Check out the new meat.<eos> I'm gonna slather you up in Gunavian jelly, and go to town...<eos> Let's make something clear.<eos> This one here is our booty!<eos> You wanna get to him, you go through us!<eos> Or, more accurately, we go through you.
- I'm giving you to the count of five.<eos> Wait, hold on!<eos> Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!<eos> We figured it out! We're fine!<eos> Hey, Quill. What's going on?<eos> You call that "figured it out"?<eos> We're gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless.<eos> You want to talk about senseless?<eos> How about trying to save us by blowing us up?<eos> We were only gonna blow you up if they didn't turn you over!
Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help.<eos> There's one more thing we need to complete the plan.<eos> That guy's eye.<eos> No, we don't. No, we don't need that guy's eye.<eos> - No, seriously, I need it!<eos> - It's important to me.<eos> Ronan's fleet has been spotted, and will arrive in T-minus fifteen minutes.<eos> Remember, boy.<eos> At the end of all this, I get the Stone.<eos> You cross me, we kill you all.
Finally.<eos> You thief!<eos> You will never make it to Ronan.<eos> Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground.<eos> Finger to the throat means death.<eos> Metaphor.<eos> Yeah, sorta.<eos> Xandar!<eos> You stand accused.<eos> Your wretched peace treaty will not save you now.
You thief!<eos> You will never make it to Ronan.<eos> Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground.<eos> Finger to the throat means death.<eos> Metaphor.<eos> Yeah, sorta.<eos> Xandar!<eos> You stand accused.<eos> Your wretched peace treaty will not save you now.<eos> It is the tinder on which you burn.
No, I don't remember when I was little!<eos> I remember when I was eight and he hit me with a tennis racket.<eos> So you're gonna shoot him?<eos> Michael. Michael, he hit me, too.<eos> Remember when I scratched the car?<eos> It warms my heart a little to see the two of you showing some initiative.<eos> - Did you tell him?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> The game's not what it was in my day, I'll tell you that.<eos> Drafting idiots like you. They turned it into a freak show.
So this little fella is a prince?<eos> So romantic.<eos> Ollie, why don't you do something like this frog do for his lo-ver?<eos> Loafer? What's a loafer?<eos> Sandy, did you hear, she just called you a loafer. Are you a loafer?<eos> Oh, it's nothing like that. Are you turning red?<eos> No. No, you are, you're turning red. I am not.<eos> Wait, wait, stop.<eos> Can you please take us to them?<eos> Oh, fastest by the river. Wait, you mean we have to swim the whole way?
There's been an incident, the rest of the staff had been temporary removed to the evacuation tunnels until we can contain this breach.<eos> No, everyone in that bunker is dead. What?<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> How is that possible?<eos> Dr Edwards, please.<eos> Penny, the girl on our boat.<eos> We need to get you to her now. - Excuse me?<eos> Didn't you respond to our stress call?<eos> I wouldn't lower that gun. - You don't move.<eos> He lured you here under false pretenses, he's gonna take your boat and he's gonna leave you behind.
I do like apple, but don't make me...<eos> I don't want to have to choose between you. Let...<eos> choose Larry.<eos> Larry, she's telling me to take you out.<eos> It's just, you're so much older, you know?<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> I'm a veteran.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now I'm gonna have to put you in the cooler.
Yeah.<eos> Now I'm gonna have to put you in the cooler.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Today.<eos> Get your pies.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Larry, it's a real honor.<eos> I want to thank you for your service.<eos> Here.<eos> I don't know if it's a blanket or a towel, but it'll keep you warm.
- Jake, you getting this?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> MAN:<eos> There it is.<eos> This tornado just touched down.<eos> We can see it from here.<eos> It's ripping up trees. It's ripping up everything in sight.<eos> If you're above ground, you need to get to a storm shelter or a safe place right now.<eos> TOM:<eos> I leave you with John Updike's words:
- Look at me!<eos> - I'm in a tornado!<eos> I'm in a tornado! REEVIS: - Whoo!<eos> (DONK WHOOPING REEVIS LAUGHING)<eos> - Yeah! REEVIS: - Oh, my God!<eos> We're in the path! We're in the path!<eos> Okay. Anchor down.<eos> How we looking?<eos> ALLISON:<eos> - It's heading right for you.
- Anything?<eos> - There's no signal.<eos> Damn it.<eos> There are those idiots.<eos> Pull over.<eos> Hey, Pete, you can pass us.<eos> PETE:<eos> - Allison, we don't have time to waste.<eos> ALLISON:<eos> - Yeah, we'll catch up to you.
Dad!<eos> Please help us!<eos> The building fell down on top of us, and there's water pouring in and I don't know how long we've got!<eos> ALLISON:<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You should know I'm not alone.<eos> Donnie's here.<eos> He's been really sweet.<eos> So it's kind of okay.<eos> I love you so much.
We gotta move this I-beam! Come on, push it!<eos> (ALL GRUNTING)<eos> - It's not gonna move. DONNIE:<eos> - Dad!<eos> GARY:<eos> - Donnie, you're okay.<eos> - Help me get her out.<eos> You're doing good.<eos> GARY:<eos> We're gonna get you out.
Dad!<eos> You touch her and I'II kill you!<eos> You got two seconds.<eos> I need the truth.<eos> -please.<eos> -Shoot her.<eos> Here I am!<eos> Get down!<eos> Cade!<eos> They're going to kill you!
It's in pieces, but watch what happens here.<eos> That's Leadfoot.<eos> They rip him apart.<eos> Savages.<eos> And later, this truck comes to haul him off.<eos> KSI.<eos> Kinetic solutions.<eos> Defence, aerospace, government contracts.<eos> They designed this drone.<eos> So these government guys just hunt you down, and then pass you off to this KSI?
We're not your technology!<eos> Let me vaporise his ass.<eos> I broke the code.<eos> I own your whole genome.<eos> The world will know what you're doing here.<eos> The world?<eos> The world will approve.<eos> We can make you now.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> We don't need you any more.
Hang on, I have the White House.<eos> Agent, hello!<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Boy, is it a flurry of excitement over here at the White House.<eos> Everybody is super, super mad.<eos> At me.<eos> So, I went over my notes from our last meeting, and I'm not sure when you said anything about a "giant alien warship over Michigan Avenue."<eos> tell the President this is not an attack.<eos> Remember this ship, Prime?<eos> built for all you Knights, you great crusaders, to explore the universe.
friendly!<eos> Enemy ships are coming in hot.<eos> Get on!<eos> Get on!<eos> hold your knickers, I'm punching it!<eos> They got three ships on them!<eos> I'm giving it the juice!<eos> Come on, Bee, take them out!<eos> Good move, Bee!<eos> This one's for you, A-hoIes!
Go, go, go!<eos> Get down!<eos> This is the perfect place to hide.<eos> A big glass box!<eos> Nobody will ever find us here!<eos> That's...<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Legendary warriors, the powers that created us now want us all extinguished.<eos> We mustjoin forces, or else forever be their slaves.<eos> So today you stand with us or you stand against me.
-You.<eos> -Who?<eos> -You.<eos> -Step forward.<eos> Wait. Why?<eos> Your science will be responsible for humanity's extinction.<eos> AII right. I know that you're sensitive to this whole bioethicaI dilemma.<eos> Maybe all he wants to hear you say is that some things should never be invented.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'II lead you out of the city.
No.<eos> This Seed belongs to our creators, whoever they are.<eos> There remains a price on my head.<eos> I endanger you all if I stay.<eos> I shall take it where it can never be found.<eos> will we ever see you again?<eos> Cade Yeager, I do not know.<eos> But whenever you look to the stars, think of one of them<eos> as my soul.<eos> Defend this family, Autobots, as they have you.
Get it, get it, get it.<eos> - I can jump from bed to bed.<eos> - If you wanna take it...<eos> I'm not gonna do this by myself.<eos> You guys help me out.<eos> One...<eos> Two...<eos> - Ah! Oh, my God!<eos> - Three...<eos> - If I get to five, I will eat you.
Please go away.<eos> What do you want me to do? What?<eos> I'm filming!<eos> Do you see?<eos> I'm doing what you say.<eos> Please.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> Happy Birthday.<eos> Are you excited?<eos> I have a present all for you.

At least it's an ambition.<eos> I just want a period of controlled happiness.<eos> Yeah, but you do it at the expense of living, of all experimentation, of all...<eos> Wai... wait a minute, you don't get to come in here.<eos> I'm telling my side of the story,<eos> I've been waiting all summer to do it.<eos> Okay, sorry.<eos> I've always dreamed of making a record.<eos> I've always dreamed that I could place a small flag in the timeline of pop history.<eos> This might seem preposterous to you, but you know what? Fuck off, this is my dream.
I'd appreciate a modicum of respect for myself and my team.<eos> Robin, he didn't know what he was saying.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's not you, Kate. You were a wonderful teacher.<eos> I've no doubt you're a wonderful mother.<eos> And Sean's a good lad.<eos> But these two... What about us two?<eos> I can look after my brother, Mr. Smythe.<eos> Can you, child?<eos> Look at the state of you. - Child? - It's high time we found you somewhere to live with proper adult supervision.
Bet your old lady got the shock of her life, didn't she, eh, the day you decided to grow a pair?<eos> But killing your kid too, your own flesh and blood...<eos> Even Saddam Hussein looked out for his kids, you rat!<eos> Now, the robots want to look inside your tiny little brain, cowboy.<eos> It won't take long, but I need to be sure the boy's headed for the camp at Stannum Valley, Silver Lake.<eos> Oh, come on! You really think the robots haven't seen the fires at night, the washing lines?<eos> They think they're safe and sound, but their time will come soon enough.<eos> And your time is now, cowboy.<eos> Goodbye, Wayne.<eos> The scan puts you into a coma.
Let's go.<eos> Let's live forever!<eos> Who else is up there?<eos> - The woman in the moon.<eos> - What about her man?<eos> - He couldn't commit.<eos> - Then kick him out!<eos> It'll just be her, the rabbit, me and you.<eos> - You'll marry me, then?<eos> - I'll marry you all.
- Actor.<eos> - Now say it together.<eos> Stay true and honest, and be a serious actor.<eos> How do you like my take on the crime scene?<eos> Romantic, grandiose, sentimental.<eos> - Get changed.<eos> - Ma Zouri!<eos> Ma Zouri!<eos> Shut up, degenerates!<eos> Keep cheering for a killer, and I'll kick you out!
So why you gotta kill Ma Zouri?<eos> Beats me.<eos> Everyone believes I killed Wanyan.<eos> Well, I did.<eos> Here's what happened:<eos> She became president and wanted to marry me.<eos> I declined.<eos> I never thought she'd die.<eos> I would've married her if I knew.<eos> Listen, if somebody wants to marry you don't hesitate.
Dale?<eos> Kurt.<eos> ALL: God, grant us...<eos> Oh, shit. It's a cult.<eos> It's a fucking cult.<eos> --about our sex addiction that we cannot change...<eos> - Sex addiction.<eos> -lt's a sex addiction. Yeah.<eos> Neat.<eos> So proud of you, every one of you, for being here today.
- I like baseball. I wear pants.<eos> -Yup.<eos> - Back to being cogs in the machine.<eos> -Cogs. Cogs, dude.<eos> KURT:<eos> Cogs are good.<eos> DALE: It's a relief, you know?<eos> It's like a weight lifted off your-- What is it, shoulders?<eos> - It's a fresh start where everything's--<eos> -I'll call you guys later.
Whoa-whee.<eos> Ah!<eos> You had us.<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh!<eos> - What's happening?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> -Oh, boy.<eos> Oh, my God, you guys. I completely underestimated you.
Oh!<eos> Oh!<eos> - What's happening?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> -Oh, boy.<eos> Oh, my God, you guys. I completely underestimated you.<eos> You fuckers have some low-hanging balls.<eos> I mean it. I'm impressed.<eos> I mean, I wake up, I find you three in my closet along with a ransom note, a big old bottle of nitrous. I'm like, "Holy shit.
Hmm?<eos> No sweat. I tacked on another zero.<eos> Jive-hundred million?<eos> -Wow, that's a ton.<eos> - Five million, guys.<eos> -Five million.<eos> - Five million.<eos> -Five. Right.<eos> Yeah, 5 million.<eos> One million dollars for you guys, and 4 for me.
Can you imagine if someone stole one of them?<eos> - I can't imagine.<eos> -You would call the cops.<eos> No, I don't think I'd call the cops. I couldn't take that risk.<eos> - Different situation.<eos> Bad example. -Shit, I'm sorry.<eos> Maybe some alone time would be helpful.<eos> Why don't we step outside, give him a minute?<eos> - We'll come back, and don't do anything rash.<eos> -Can I talk to you outside, please?
I know.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Poor, poor guy.<eos> - I mean, that is rough.<eos> Rough. -Are you guys shitting me in there?<eos> His dad sold him out for-- It was probably nothing to him.<eos> -Pennies to him.<eos> -The guy's rich.<eos> That would rock me to my core. Have a little empathy. Please?<eos> What are you talking about? You're acting like you have Stockholm Syndrome.
Here we go.<eos> Bu! when he gels there... he finds the dark phone that I planted ahead of time.<eos> Then we call him from the second dark phone, and tell him to proceed downtown.<eos> Hello.<eos> You'll wanna pull into the garage under the Mandrake Hotel and park in Space 4421.<eos> There, you will find a red bag.<eos> You will transfer the money into this bag, then drive out and await the location of the drop.<eos> And we tell him if anyone follows him in, his son's a fucking corpse.<eos> And when Ben drives that far underground... the police will lose the signal from his wire.<eos> Bu! when he arrives, instead of finding a bag he finds you three. Disguised.
- They're not even allowed at this pool.<eos> -I can't turn my mind off.<eos> - Guys. Guys.<eos> Guys. -Will you stop it?<eos> Come on. Let's not argue, okay?<eos> We came up with an awesome plan.<eos> It is smart.<eos> It is mad creative.<eos> You know, you boys continue to impress me.<eos> - L'm proud of you.
You gotta stick with it.<eos> What do you think? Should I beat myself up more?<eos> No, you don't need to hit yourself anymore.<eos> I think we should just make the call.<eos> Hold on. Before we kick this thing off, can I just say something?<eos> I'm not really, ugh, good at this kind of thing, you know?<eos> Um... My mom died when I was 4, and, um...<eos> You know, when you're raised by Bert Hanson most of your friends are shitheads.<eos> Um...<eos> Yeah. I know I dragged you guys into this, but I'm not sorry.

I know I dragged you guys into this, but I'm not sorry.<eos> Because I'm really glad I met you guys.<eos> Anyway, I want you guys to have this.<eos> - What is it?<eos> -lt's an actual fang from Predator.<eos> - Predalor the movie?<eos> -Yep.<eos> I want you to have it.
- Here we go. Let's do it.<eos> -Let's roll.<eos> Let's just do what we gotta do, do it confidently and, uh, we should be fine.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> -Oh.<eos> - Hi, boys.<eos> -Oh, hi.<eos> You staying at the hotel, or is this your hotel?<eos> You staying here?<eos> I've been keeping my eye on you since you broke into my office.
- You shot him.<eos> -No, I didn't.<eos> - You did.<eos> -That was not supposed to be loaded.<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> -That's not my fault.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> -Wait, hold--<eos> Man.<eos> You should've seen your faces right now when you started blaming each other.
- You did.<eos> -That was not supposed to be loaded.<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> -That's not my fault.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> -Wait, hold--<eos> Man.<eos> You should've seen your faces right now when you started blaming each other.<eos> What's happening right now?<eos> I'm fucking you over.
Let's have that.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Yeah. - No, I- - Right.<eos> Sorry. -Thanks, man.<eos> Didn't wanna hold onto that for two more minutes?<eos> No, that was a gift.<eos> - Did you park the Prius in the back alley?<eos> -I sure did. - Do you have the keys?<eos> -Here you go.<eos> I'm really proud of you guys.

You pulled together. You worked like a team.<eos> Just like we planned.<eos> L'm- - I'm gonna miss you guys.
By the way, what the hell were you doing back there in that garage in the first place?<eos> What's that, now?<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> -What's going on?<eos> You were down there to steal the ransom money.<eos> Listen, I hustle, I don't steal.<eos> What the fuck does that--?<eos> What were you doing in the garage?<eos> I was thinking there was a chance the drop might go south, and that guy would kill y'all.<eos> And in such a scenario, you'd rather me have the cash than him.
The three of you walked in with smiles on your fucking pathetic faces.<eos> Why were you born?<eos> Why were the three of you born?<eos> Looking at you is like looking out over the Grand Canyon of ineptitude.<eos> It's a wonder your parents didn't smother you--<eos> - Where you going?<eos> -See you next week.<eos> I have an idea. Why don't you try a suicide pact?<eos> And I'm not talking about throwing yourself off a building or some sleeping-pills shit.<eos> I'm talking about, you fuck each other to death.
I chose St. William of Rochester, the patron saint of adopted children.<eos> It's a pretty interesting story, all the other saint I looked at were all so... saintly, I guess.<eos> What does "saintly" mean to you?<eos> I don't know, I don't really believe in saints and all that.<eos> I feel like St. William just got to be a saint because he's killed by the boy he adopted.<eos> These days, people get killed all the time, and they don't get to be a saint for it.<eos> All right, well, thanks, Oliver.<eos> Despite young Oliver's reticence, I DO happen to believe there are saints all around us today.<eos> They may never be considered as such by a religion, but they are just as important as the ones in your textbooks.<eos> Thus, you are going to research someone you know, or know of, and determine if they have the qualities fit for sainthood.
Me, too.<eos> Sit down, okay, coffee or juice?<eos> - Latte.<eos> - Nice try.<eos> - My water is broken!<eos> - Call a plumber.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Get up!<eos> Hello...<eos> sit down children, thank you.
- Now I'm getting interested.<eos> Okay, so there's this crazy girl, right? She's posted like 6000 messages on my Facebook fan page in like 2 months.<eos> Sounds like marriage material.<eos> You should just fuck her, right?<eos> Or eat her on her period.<eos> Come on, don't be vulgar.<eos> Yeah, Bri won't even do that to me.<eos> Well he can't. Because your menopausal!<eos> - Oh! - Shut up!<eos> Would you guys chill, come on.
Alright.<eos> We're done Benjie.<eos> I'll see you Friday.<eos> Alright, thanks Rusty.<eos> What are you doing in there?<eos> What the fuck are you doing in my pool?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Micah!<eos> It's a drowned boy.<eos> I don't want to see you.
How about I just diffused a major meltdown. Her hair, okay?<eos> I have to take the first flight out tomorrow morning.<eos> I'm calling a sitter.<eos> I was late because I found a doctor who can help me.<eos> - What?<eos> - There's, um...<eos> There's a specialist here in Paris who has a experimental drug she's willing to test on me.<eos> Experimental.<eos> What exactly does that mean?<eos> It means I might be able to spend a little more time with you and Zooey.

18 laboratory BLOCK?<eos> - No wait!<eos> Let's look briefly again.<eos> What is there to think about?<eos> - you want to publish a simple?<eos> This is not a question!<eos> - For anyone but deserves recognition.<eos> Why?<eos> want me to write:<eos> in love, for you, Lionel Stanton?
- You're a drunk.<eos> - That's true. Pass me that.<eos> - But isn't Donald Jeffries in jail?<eos> - No, he didn't go to jail.<eos> - His father paid the money back. - Mm.<eos> How about his wife?<eos> Did she stick it out?<eos> No, nobody stuck it out.<eos> So when do we start?<eos> - Good to see you!
- Is Preston here?<eos> - Private Preston Savitz.<eos> Private?<eos> That won't sit well with him. It doesn't.<eos> Finally we have your sculptor, Sergeant Walter Garfield.<eos> He's a good egg. I worked with him on the World War I memorial - in St. Louis.<eos> Hey, Stokes!<eos> How are you, old boy?<eos> Hey, Walter.<eos> How are they treating you?
I'd like to forcefully introduce myself.<eos> I am James Granger... and I'm the curator of Medieval art at the Met...<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Then you know I'd like to help.<eos> I know nothing.<eos> And will you stop speaking in French?<eos> Or whatever language you are speaking.<eos> Well, if it weren't for us, you'd be speaking German.<eos> No.<eos> If it wasn't for you, I might be dead.
Move!<eos> [RECRUITS SHOUTING]<eos> TONY:<eos> Take seats!<eos> D:<eos> Yeah! 56 degrees! So fresh, so clean!<eos> MAN:<eos> Here she comes!<eos> TONY:<eos> Mother Nature's got something for you!
It's all part of the plan.<eos> Your heart is beating out of your chest.<eos> That's just because I'm not the only one who's going to war, that's all.<eos> MARC:<eos> Welcome to Fallujah. The new Wild West of the old Middle East.<eos> AQI put a price on your heads, and now extremists from around the globe are flooding the borders to collect on it.<eos> You snipers, you're gonna be paired with a Marine to watch your back and inserted along the main road to do overwatch for 1st Marines going door to door.<eos> Your job is to protect those Marines at all costs.<eos> The city has been evacuated.<eos> Any military-age male who is still here is here to kill you.
Ask him to sign their burka.<eos> -Appear at their child's birthday parties.<eos> -Ha-ha—ha.<eos> Hey, what is your problem?<eos> I didn't promote myself.<eos> Yeah, no shit, motherfucker.<eos> I did that for you.<eos> You would've never made chief if I had nicknamed you the fucking Myth or some shit.<eos> [SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]<eos> He invites you to join him for Eid al—Adha supper.
Excuse me for this.<eos> As the Baker's wife bolted from the tower, the second night of the Festival was thrown into chaos...<eos> Stop! ...when Cinderella, once again, ran from the Prince.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> So sorry, I need your shoe.<eos> Who is she?<eos> Where did she go?<eos> I have no idea, sir.<eos> Don't play the fool, woman.<eos> No, I was trying to hold her here for you.
You'll come with us.<eos> Why does he always cry when I hold him?<eos> Well, you needn't hold him as though he was so fragile.<eos> He doesn't want me. He wants his mother.<eos> I can't take care of him all the time.<eos> I will take care of him when he's older.<eos> Watch your heads. Who might that be?<eos> It's the Steward and the royal family.<eos> Hello there.<eos> What brings you into the woods?
Be quiet, woman, or you'll get us all killed! You must be quiet!<eos> Flouncing through our kingdom in your great big clodhoppers... Let us not anger the giant! ...destroying everything in your path!<eos> - Let's not anger the giant.<eos> I'm gonna get my boy and hide him so you'll never find him!<eos> - You'll never, never, ever...<eos> The boy is hiding in the steeple tower!<eos> - You can find him there!<eos> - That's true!<eos> Yes, we saw him there!<eos> And if he is not, I will return tonight and find you.
I'm sure others have suffered worse after the earthquake.<eos> No, no, this isn't an earthquake.<eos> There's a giant terrorizing the kingdom.<eos> Then I'm sure the Prince will see to it that the giant is rid from our land.<eos> The Prince?<eos> No doubt he's off somewhere seducing some young maiden.<eos> What?<eos> You look like the Princess, but dirty.<eos> Oh, my! You are the...<eos> I didn't recognize you, honestly.
Anyway, it doesn't matter now<eos> It's the last midnight<eos> It's the boom Splat<eos> Nothing but a vast midnight<eos> Everybody smashed flat<eos> Nothing we can do Not exactly true<eos> We could always give her the boy<eos> No, of course<eos> What really matters is the blame Someone you can blame<eos> Fine, if that's the thing you enjoy Placing the blame If that's the aim Give me the blame
You're all liars and thieves Like his father<eos> Like his son will be, too<eos> Oh, why bother?<eos> You'll just do what you do<eos> It's the last midnight So goodbye, all<eos> Coming at you fast Midnight<eos> Soon you'll see the sky fall<eos> Here, you want a bean?<eos> Have another bean<eos> Beans were made for making you rich
Soon you'll see the sky fall<eos> Here, you want a bean?<eos> Have another bean<eos> Beans were made for making you rich<eos> Plant them and they soar Here, you want some more?<eos> Listen to the roar Giants by the score<eos> Oh well, you can blame another witch<eos> It's the last midnight It's the last verse<eos> Now, before it's past midnight I'm leaving you my last curse<eos> I'm leaving you alone You can tend the garden, it's yours Separate and alone
Look, all I'm saying is, when you get to your new house, put a poster up, put some shelves on the wall, frame a photo.<eos> Look, there's a painting right there. Put something on a shelf...<eos> That's not a painting.<eos> That looks like somebody just took a bunch of dirt, smudged it and called it art.<eos> I'm going to Munch's house to play a video game, all right? - Okay.<eos> - Yeah, sure, buddy.<eos> - Bye, Dylan. - Have fun with your friends.<eos> - Hey, hey, Tuck. - How are you?<eos> Uh, good luck with the move to New York, buddy.<eos> - Maybe we'll come see you. - All right, cool.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!<eos> Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!<eos> How to unfold a napkin? !<eos> - Who cares!<eos> - Fine!<eos> And in no time in my life am I gonna be somewhere - that even plays the foxtrot! - Close the door.<eos> Yo, put it away, man.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> What the...?<eos> Wait, I know you.
- The phone.<eos> - No, no, no! - Munch!<eos> - Munch!<eos> - Munch!<eos> Munch! - Munch!<eos> Munch!<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Munch!<eos> This is not real, this is not real, this is not real right now.<eos> Don't let them see you.
Uh, here, check his pockets.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Cops are gone. - Uh, Tuck, Tuck?<eos> - I have no idea where Marcus is.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tell me you got that on tape?<eos> My name is Reginald "Munch" Barrett.<eos> This is my... kind of my final message.<eos> To my best friends...<eos> I love you, guys.
Six hours later, Alex moved.<eos> I just got grounded for, like, life.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Might as well move now.<eos> Not gonna be seeing anyone for a while.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But this... what really happened tonight... no one knows but us.<eos> Hey, Alex!<eos> Time to go, buddy.<eos> I'm gonna miss you guys.
We were interrupted last time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I can't wait.<eos> You will be there, Sherlock?<eos> Weddings, not really my thing.<eos> Hello, Molly.<eos> This is Tom.<eos> Tom, this is everyone.<eos> Hi. Hi.<eos> It's really nice to meet you all.
Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Welcome to Limelight!<eos> For those of you who are new,<eos> I'm your stage manager, David Martin.<eos> I'm here to make sure that the show goes on no matter what, and I will do whatever it takes.<eos> Well, except go on stage...<eos> I don't do that.<eos> Hello, stage fright.<eos> But backstage, make no mistake: I run the space and you will feel my wrath.<eos> J/K, I love you guys.

How do you know?<eos> Just spoke with him.<eos> Congratulations, Mr. Producer.<eos> Ah, Camilla, that's... not... true.<eos> It's true.<eos> Yeah, it's true.<eos> You went onto the stage, but I saw what you did!<eos> Larry, we can't.<eos> He was just here; he's gonna catch us.<eos> I already caught you.
- He gives me everything you don't.<eos> - What? - What?<eos> - You just don't love me!<eos> - So I don't love you, huh?<eos> Then what's this then?<eos> - What the hell am I supposed to do with that? - Fine.<eos> Choke on it. - Hey!<eos> Is that how you want her to remember the big question?<eos> Listen, do you know how long some people wait their whole lives to be with the one person they love, and you two morons have found each other, and you're wasting precious time acting like children.<eos> Now, she obviously loves you if she's jumping in a car with a complete stranger...
- Oh, a contractor.<eos> He'll look at the office while you go.<eos> Unless you want to stay.<eos> I would love to, but it's kind of a tricky project... and I don't want to complicate things. But it was really nice meeting you.<eos> You, too.<eos> I hope I see you again soon.<eos> Carmela?<eos> Really?<eos> Did you and Tony enjoy Hong Kong?<eos> Or did Big Pussy and Meadow miss you too much?
But when they confront him about it and they tell him about the money, he lied again.<eos> He said something like, "Oh, yeah. Now I remember.<eos> Good one. Good one, guys."<eos> Jack said he is the only guy to tell the lie and then to have the balls to stand and stick up for the lie.<eos> Said it was the second strangest response he had seen to the $100 bill thing.<eos> Wanna know what the first was?<eos> God damn it, Ralph. Just tell me.<eos> A kid mailed the $100 bill back to them.<eos> That kid put it in a card, and he wrote on the card,<eos> "Save this for when I win you the Super Bowl."
Whoo, whoo!<eos> Oh, dude, that's, like, your fifth piece of pizza.<eos> I eat when I'm nervous. Don't make me feel bad about it.<eos> Yeah, I get like that, too.<eos> Hey, guys. It's gettin' late.<eos> History in the making here today at the NFL Draft.<eos> Already fascinating twists and turns as the Seattle Seahawks and the Cleveland Browns have engaged in a historic trade just hours before this moment.<eos> Here's the Commissioner.<eos> Welcome to primetime and the 2014 NFL Draft.<eos> This is an exciting night for our players, our teams, and for you, the fans.
It's a personal, a personal thing.<eos> You look worried, Fada.<eos> My advice, take it on the lamaster, huh.<eos> You don't wanna drop in for the phonus-balonus and wind up with a sock in the kisser. Get me?<eos> He's not in the mood, Leo.<eos> Maybe I can cheer up the old sourpuss.<eos> I'll show you a good time, Fada.<eos> 'Good Time Leo', that's me.<eos> Although it'll be extra if I let you wear the cassock.<eos> I know what you holy-rollers are like when you get going. Hell's bells, mama!
- It's a sigil.<eos> - A what?<eos> A sigil.<eos> A sign of devil worship.<eos> Which one of you idiots put this into her mind?<eos> Will you please just consider the possibility that Jane didn't create Evey?<eos> Okay, that maybe Evey came from...<eos> Somewhere else?<eos> What came from somewhere else, is the idea of the fucking occult to a patient who is highly suggestible!<eos> So, I ask you again, which one of you was it?
Seriously, I'm really happy for you.<eos> Thank you, sweetheart.<eos> That means a lot to me.<eos> So, what are your plans while you're at home?<eos> I have some studying to do, but mostly I just wanna relax. See some old friends.<eos> You know, the usual.<eos> Welcome back, stranger.<eos> - Such a fucking rebel.<eos> - Kat, you're my new idol.<eos> Oh, my God I've missed you guys.
Oh, it's... it's no problem.<eos> - Goodnight, dear.<eos> - Good night.<eos> I don't think it's right with her here.<eos> - But if Kat says she's comfortable, I don't...<eos> - I don't care what Kat said.<eos> Dad?<eos> Honey?<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.<eos> If you two are arguing over whether or not May can sleep over, it's totally fine.
I don't wanna have anything to do with the police.<eos> Please, Mom, just do what you can and I'll get him out of here soon.<eos> - I promise.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - Okay, just get me the first-aid kit.<eos> No, don't... don't touch me.<eos> I'm sick.<eos> Don't touch my blood.<eos> Here, Mom.<eos> Let me die. Or I'll kill you both.
- No! Leave him alone.<eos> - You stay here!<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> - Tell me!<eos> Tell me what you did? Or I'll kill him right here.<eos> - No. Don't tell him.<eos> He'll kill us anyway.<eos> - You shut the fuck up.<eos> If you talk... I'll let you go.
Come on, put a little pep in your step.<eos> Listen up, people.<eos> You got exactly one hour to go settle into your room and say your goodbyes!<eos> 'Cause for the next 24 hours, the boys are gonna be with the boys...<eos> And the girls with the girls.<eos> Tomorrow, you can all go back to that miserable and sexless existence that is marriage.<eos> - No offense, Mike.<eos> - You don't gotta worry about us.<eos> We gonna be happy and sexy.<eos> Well, you better treasure that.
No!<eos> You think Jeremy's right?<eos> 'Cause they say where you're at in your sex life is where you're at in real life.<eos> What if I'm just controlling, you know?<eos> What if I am a drill sergeant?<eos> I'm fun, all right?<eos> I'm fun, okay?<eos> I'm back, Randy.<eos> All right.<eos> We're gonna take you guys back to the '90s.
- What are you supposed to be?<eos> - A sexy hobbit.<eos> No, I'm a sexy caveman.<eos> Gotta be kidding me.<eos> Black Spartacus?<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> All right, fellas.<eos> You got 15 minutes before show time.<eos> Loosen up, bro.<eos> All them ladies gonna eat you alive out there.
Can I get a Candace?<eos> Do we have a Candace in the house?<eos> Candace, come up on stage.<eos> Come on!<eos> Fellas, go get Candace.<eos> Go, yes, take her!<eos> Give it up for Candace, ladies.<eos> Good one, Lauren.<eos> Yeah, I got her good, didn't I?<eos> Come on, ladies, let me hear you.

But I don't like calling you Jody. I'm sorry. It skeeves me out.<eos> And your fanny-pack is digging into my groin.<eos> - His real name is Tyrese.<eos> - I'm gonna call you Tyrese.<eos> - Tyrese? - Yes.<eos> Take off your fanny-pack, Tyrese!<eos> It's killing me!<eos> If there was ever a time to chill out, now would be it.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Guess you girls really did get your freak on last night?
And Sean is a respected professional.<eos> If you say so, darling.<eos> Well, I've started reading what's considered to be the leading authority on the subject. And I find it fascinating... how the unconscious can alter the reality... and that dreams can be used in therapy just like hypnosis is.<eos> See? Jim takes an interest in what I do.<eos> You never believed in anything I've ever done and you're my mother!<eos> When are you going to wake up and face reality?<eos> It's not in your dreams you'll find the answers you're looking for.<eos> Well if I had a mother who was honest about things like... who my biological father actually is, maybe I wouldn't have to.<eos> Ladies, please...<eos> This is the first time we've sat down at a table for three years... and all you can do is bicker.
But so lucrative!<eos> I'm on a roll, big brother!<eos> And there is no stopping me!<eos> Hi, aunt cass.<eos> Are you guys okay?<eos> Tell me you're okay.<eos> - We're fine. - We're okay.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Then what were you two knuckleheads thinking?<eos> For 10 years, I have done the best I could to raise you.
Veer right!<eos> Okay, to the left.<eos> Hard right!<eos> Up and over.<eos> Okay, level off.<eos> Nice flying!<eos> Almost there!<eos> My thrusters are inoperable.<eos> Just grab hold.<eos> There is still a way I can get you both to safety.
I? C ?<eos> Watch ? , brother-? .<eos> Come and!<eos> Come and!<eos> T and forget it? Harp.<eos> A s? -? I?<eos> warm. F? R?<eos> Come and!<eos> do not go. please.<eos> S God? AIB you? ?

Esa, descended?<eos> And this? flower was? turned to the sun ...<eos> And therefore is called? 're sunflowers.<eos> You have the worry? ... s? not V?
Oh, no.<eos> Not on my watch.<eos> We have to free the animals!<eos> Come on, you guys!<eos> Let's do this!<eos> -Yeah!<eos> -Hold on, Maria.<eos> Don't!<eos> People of San angel, please!<eos> I beg you.
Wait, isn't that when that bull put you in a coma?<eos> Ah, memories.<eos> My only son fighting angry, thousand-pound beasts.<eos> The family tradition continues.<eos> Yay.<eos> And so, the day came when Maria would leave to study abroad.<eos> The three amigos would be no more.<eos> Adios, Maria write soon.<eos> I'm going to go over there.<eos> I'm gonna miss you guys.
You might end up in Tijuana.<eos> I think I died there.<eos> Welcome to the land of the forgotten.<eos> Sad, huh?<eos> You poor things.<eos> And that's gonna happen to us if we don't hurry.<eos> Come on.<eos> There it is, xibalba's castle.<eos> LA muerte!<eos> I need a word with you, my lady!
I gotta go.<eos> But joaquin is the only one who can defeat chakal.<eos> We can fight them together, papa.<eos> Get up and fight like a Sanchez!<eos> Mama?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Cholesterol.<eos> Everyone!<eos> Listen up!<eos> I know you're scared, but look around you.
I will be there no matter where you are no matter where you are<eos> I'll be there<eos> I will be there no matter where you are no matter where you are<eos> I'll be there<eos> I'll be there and the world keeps spinning...<eos> And people come, and people go... But they are never forgotten.<eos> And the one truth we know, it held true one more time... That love, true love... The really, really good kind of love...<eos> Caramba, it gets me every time.<eos> Okay, kids, closing time.<eos> Your bus should be outside waiting for you.
and time was not on our side.<eos> A letter from Monsieur Gustave.<eos> Zero.<eos> - You want me to?<eos> - Read it.<eos> "My dear and trusted colleagues..."<eos> I miss you deeply as I write from the confines of my regrettable and preposterous incarceration.<eos> Until I walk amongst you again as a free man, the Grand Budapest remains in your hands, as does its impeccable reputation.<eos> Keep it spotless and glorify it.<eos> Take extra special care of every little-bitty bit of it as if I were watching over you like a hawk with a horse whip in its talons, because I am.

Kermit, what if I do four or five Celine Dion songs?<eos> You know Celine Dion, she works in Vegas.<eos> No, Piggy, there's no time for that.<eos> What about the band's marathon jam session?<eos> Drum solo!<eos> Drum solo! No drum solo!<eos> Guys, guys, guys!<eos> We can't just do whatever we want.<eos> This is our opening night. Let's play to our strengths, because...<eos> Well... Look, I didn't want to worry you guys but if we don't sell this theater out, it would mean the end of the tour.
So what will you do?<eos> His father never let that happen.<eos> My father is dead.<eos> And you're under my command now.<eos> Or continues with this, or are free to go alone.<eos> Come here.<eos> - Do not do it again.<eos> - Or what?<eos> You will not kill me.<eos> Life'm useless to you.
Or continues with this, or are free to go alone.<eos> Come here.<eos> - Do not do it again.<eos> - Or what?<eos> You will not kill me.<eos> Life'm useless to you.<eos> Truth.<eos> But if bruised, your father still pay the same.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Since here, obviously is not your land, I should ask you first.
We'll get.<eos> Daughter.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> I think not.<eos> Keep!<eos> We need to go now.<eos> You came back for me.<eos> You let loose your puppies?<eos> And yours? You seem to be alone.<eos> Lady Inghean, his father is worried about you.
- So why do you care so much?<eos> I'm... I'm writing a...<eos> "Greedy man hands!"<eos> ...a slam poem in her honour.<eos> Early stages, very early stages.<eos> - Really? - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Wouldn't it be better just to, like, plan the stuff out ahead of time, make sure it's funny, and then not say it in front of people and embarrass yourself?<eos> That's a thing that people do.<eos> That's stand-up comedy.<eos> That's probably what you should do, because that stuff's funny.
Mitch, I am serious. You're a father now, okay?<eos> You can't afford to take chances.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry. See?<eos> Look, even Ella agrees.<eos> Ella?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Don't change the topic.<eos> I don't know what I'd do if I lost you guys.
(BELL RINGING)<eos> (PEOPLE CLAMORING)<eos> MASTER:<eos> I warned you.

Not a bad night's work.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hail, Thorin, son of Thrain.<eos> We are glad to find you alive beyond hope.<eos> Why do you come to the gates... of the King under the Mountain armed for war?<eos> Why does the King under the Mountain fence himself in... like a robber in his hold?<eos> THORIN:<eos> Perhaps it is because I am expecting to be robbed.<eos> BARD:<eos> My lord... we have not come to rob you... but to seek fair settlement.
I came... to give you... this.<eos> The Heart of the Mountain.<eos> The King's Jewel.<eos> And worth a king's ransom.<eos> How is this... yours to give?<eos> I took it as my 14th share of the treasure.<eos> BARD:<eos> Why would you do this?<eos> You owe us no loyalty.<eos> I'm not doing it for you.
Are you ready to die for it?<eos> LEGOLAS IN ELVISH:<eos> (IN ENGLISH) I will go with you.<eos> (ROARS)<eos> (SCREAMS)<eos> Get up.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> I don't take orders... from you.<eos> People trusted you.<eos> They listened to you.
- Well,... maybe this will put you more at ease.<eos> OK, I know this is kind of bad, but... Again.<eos> Again.<eos> Again.<eos> Less work for me.<eos> Billy, open up.<eos> It's Rick.<eos> Hey, Billy!<eos> Ricky.<eos> Don't let the attractive exterior fool you.
But, don't you worry, the archdiocese will take care of everything.<eos> Peace out.<eos> Sisters? Better hurry.<eos> Should we call the police?<eos> We pay you good money to run this place. But, that is the best you can do?<eos> They look like they have full-blown hepatitis.<eos> It's the morning shift. I mean, I'm working on putting a breakfast buffet in here that will blow your fucking mind, Vitolda.<eos> I'm talking about eggs and bacon, whipped cream, sausage, and a lap dance, all in, $12.99.<eos> You girls suck!<eos> How many times have I told you, you won't draw a crowd if you don't draw a bath.
I'm tingling all over.<eos> I'm alive again, Papakins, I'm reborn.<eos> We can't go back into town in this state.<eos> Of course not. You have to go to the shops for perfume, and new dresses, and...<eos> - We'll do a list. -Ah, yes...<eos> - we shall really go to town!<eos> - Real life, at last.<eos> You can come to town with me.<eos> It's time I present my successor to Dumont.<eos> I won't let you down, sir. Thank you.
I just want a rose.<eos> I can't get them to grow here.<eos> They're taking everything!<eos> They even refuse to allow me to board my own ship.<eos> You must face the facts,<eos> The Mermaid and her cargo no longer belong to you.<eos> They treating me like I'm dirt.<eos> Without me, this place would be no more than a fishing port, and you don't give a damn!<eos> You lacked judgment, my poor friend.<eos> You signed away all the letters of credit, despite my having warned you.
Trouble's in the air.<eos> What 'ya having?<eos> I'm searching for my son.<eos> I heard he drinks here a lot?<eos> A customer of this dump?<eos> I feel for him. Here you are.<eos> What's your boy's name?<eos> Maxime de Beauffremont.<eos> Keep your voice down.<eos> I think we'd better sneak you out through the back door.
Well, nearly.<eos> Who took care of you?<eos> My gifts aren't enough for you?<eos> Must you also steal what I hold most dear?<eos> I shall not let anyone treat me as a thief or a coward.<eos> I am a man of dignity.<eos> For whom is this rose?<eos> For the youngest of my daughters.<eos> I love her more than life itself.<eos> So I'm giving you a single day to bid farewell to those you love.
"Eat." "Don't look at me."<eos> "Don't do this, don't do that."<eos> I'll teach that animal some manners!<eos> What is this?<eos> Oh, it's me.<eos> A spitting image.<eos> What a lovely gift.<eos> I wonder who gave me such a pretty doll.<eos> Where are you hiding?<eos> Come out, I won't eat you.
In exchange, you will let me see them.<eos> You're treating me like a beggar.<eos> I can lead, if you're afraid.<eos> Dancing with me doesn't scare you?<eos> You lead.<eos> Could you love me?<eos> We made a deal.<eos> Keep your promise.<eos> It's been a long time since I promised anything.<eos> You dress in the finery of a prince, you claim you're a man, but you're just a cruel and lonely beast.
Clotilde?<eos> I've come back.<eos> Clotilde, do you see what I see?<eos> It's Belle's ghost come to haunt us, all red and bloody.<eos> It's not a dream, my dears.<eos> It is me.<eos> I came to bid you a last goodbye.<eos> Even dead she's prettier than us.<eos> Kook at her, she's so thin!<eos> I want you to know I love you forever.
You can tell her yourself.<eos> Stop it!<eos> You, my dear, can help me.<eos> Release her!<eos> What are you anyway? A lion?<eos> A big cat?<eos> Who is going to bleed you to death.<eos> You can purr as much as you like.<eos> But if you want her back in one piece, you'll let me get away.<eos> I beg you!
- In the water, quickly!<eos> - Go! - Up!<eos> He stopped breathing.<eos> Don't worry about us.<eos> On guard, brothers!<eos> We've missed our dinner.<eos> You sound as if you regret it.<eos> Belle, do you think that... with a bit of patience,<eos> or maybe some compassion, you will have found a way... to love me?<eos> But I love you now.
Follow me!<eos> Since a long time.<eos> Come on, you too, Mom!<eos> Are you sure?<eos> The come.<eos> Our Thai-goddesses.<eos> Sorry, it must be a mistake.<eos> - We are here to Thai massage.<eos> - Yes, the full Thai treatment.<eos> I'm doing good happy ending for you.
But we gotta go.<eos> - Yeah. Bye. Come here.<eos> Okay, I'll see you at home. Love you! Bye!<eos> - Bye!<eos> - Bye!<eos> I Bye!<eos> But the fact that you guys made that promise to each other, promise to always be a team, it means you have to start thinking about how you present yourselves, okay?<eos> It's... it's... I'm just saying that it's not necessary. You guys are so good it's actually distracting.<eos> Albert thinks it makes us stand out.<eos> I don't think so. I think what makes you stand out is your talent.
Damn. He's really good.<eos> - Say it again, I'll shoot you.<eos> - Chill.<eos> Get in.<eos> - Where's the bomb?<eos> - It'll be here.<eos> Barney, it looks like the target is right on time.<eos> There's Minns.<eos> Let's take him out fast.<eos> Barney, I gotta put you down.
But nothing lasts forever.<eos> Hard as it is to hear, we aren't the future anymore.<eos> Unfortunately for us, we're part of the past.<eos> You going somewhere with this?<eos> As I see it, if we keep this life up, the only way this thing ends, for all of us,<eos> is in a hole in the ground and no one giving a shit.<eos> Now, if that's the way I'm supposed to go out, I can live with that.<eos> For me.<eos> But what I can't live with, and won't live with,<eos> is taking you with me.
Something's wrong here.<eos> Unbalanced.<eos> I think it was better before.<eos> On to the third round.<eos> 29 black.<eos> We hope you enjoyed your evening and that we'll see you again soon!<eos> Stop moving!<eos> Get the thing out.<eos> I want to know what she's got to tell us.<eos> Fuck you!
They do u kiss මනං .. Every one who is naked here හැංඟිලයි.<eos> Trees that raise everything else is open.<eos> Second, the big issue here is the language.<eos> It means that, today, the chickens eat, or one that will take fish.<eos> They think about the difference between what we say and what research is.<eos> Third, we need to collect clothes from the car down, quit walking and dancing.<eos> You put everyone in their underwear kicked remote control.<eos> Nobody steals failed to hit the nail.<eos> Fourth, and most important point.<eos> Needing to meet someone who can connect to God ගැහුනොත්, Left side of the research, on the other side of the back, you can come back fast.
Explaining what wrong?<eos> - No way, we're not paying.<eos> - You tell her.<eos> Explain it right.<eos> Now we're in trouble for showing your tit in public.<eos> Put it away. Cover it up, cover it up, for God's sake!<eos> This used to be for nudists, now you can't even breastfeed.<eos> Beers for the family.<eos> It's really great to see you, Martin.<eos> I couldn't wait to see you all.
No way.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Not me.<eos> - Yes, you will.<eos> Stop...<eos> Switzerland does wonders for you!<eos> - Take off this damn bra.<eos> - Someone will hear you.<eos> Who cares? Nobody can understand me.<eos> Some of us understand you perfectly!
Right, "Vitchy." That's where my suitcase got stolen.<eos> I wandered around France for 4 days until a very nice truck driver taking oranges to where Sissi...<eos> Sissi, Charo's cousin from Almendralejo?<eos> No, the one from the movie.<eos> Vienna?<eos> - "Sissi<eos> - The Young Empress."<eos> - That's it.<eos> Vienna.<eos> Anyway, he took me to the police and they called this nice young man who said he knew you and was coming to the baptism.
And you must be the famous Dr. Quirke.<eos> I've heard a great deal about you.<eos> All good things, I hope.<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> You must be exhausted.<eos> Deirdre will show you to your rooms.<eos> Thank you.<eos> When you're ready, please come down.<eos> We'll have drinks before dinner.<eos> Josh can't wait to see you.
I've got to go.<eos> Brenda!<eos> Come on!<eos> We used to come up here,<eos> Delia and me, in the old days.<eos> What was she like?<eos> I want to know now that I'm here.<eos> The house seems full of her, somehow.<eos> Delia was wild - she had the imp of perversity in her.<eos> How did the four of you meet?
Hey, yo, Father Joseph, make sure you save me a beer, buddy.<eos> Hello?<eos> That's what we do.<eos> That's right.<eos> Benny, my man.<eos> I thought you had him, brother.<eos> Nah, I had him in the turns.<eos> Where were you?<eos> We missed you, brother, we missed you.<eos> What do you mean? I was flying, watching your butts.
Wait a minute.<eos> Wait a minute, did you just say what I think you said?<eos> That car is one of three in the world.<eos> You're willing to give away your Lamborghini to stop Tobey Marshall?<eos> Yes, I am. And I'm gonna post some pictures online so everybody knows exactly what they're looking for.<eos> This is too good.<eos> I got star-crossed lovers hauling ass across the country.<eos> I got Dino Brewster, who just painted a huge bull's-eye on their ass. Man.<eos> Christmas came early, wing nuts.<eos> The thing you gotta understand is, racing is an art.
There you go.<eos> All right, don't kill us.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Have you got her?<eos> - Yeah. - All right.<eos> Good.<eos> Good, good, good.<eos> Jesus!<eos> That was on purpose. Yeah, thanks to Dino's bounty.<eos> They're coming at you.

With that clubfoot?<eos> Stop it.<eos> - Shut up, worm.<eos> You piss off and go back to your own village.<eos> It's just a fake.<eos> - Run, Lambert!<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> What shall we do with him?<eos> - Let's tie him to the tracks.<eos> I'll get you, you brats.
Thy Kingdom come<eos> Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven<eos> Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.<eos> Amen.<eos> Blackie is already outside.<eos> Come on, hurry.<eos> Hold my hand.<eos> - The British are here to liberate us!<eos> No, the British are on their way to bomb Germany.<eos> We'll flatten you.
For a little while.<eos> I can't forbid it. - You can!<eos> You're his father.<eos> It's his best friend.<eos> And wouldn't it look suspicious?<eos> Everyone will understand we don't want our son visiting a collaborating mayor.<eos> There's too much at stake.<eos> - That's exactly why.<eos> Everyone got cookies.<eos> I brought you...
- Let's go.<eos> If someone some can help you, it will be our Shaman.<eos> So let me get this straight, We aren't going to see the dragon again, right?<eos> We are safe.<eos> For now.<eos> - I don't do horses.<eos> - Why?<eos> What do you mean, Why?<eos> I can't ride a horse. - Quite simple.<eos> - For you maybe.
- Oh my God.<eos> - Ah! Goddammit!<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's go.<eos> This is hurting my ass.<eos> - Who are they?<eos> - Terrowin's men.<eos> Well, let's not keep them waiting.<eos> Hazen, get off.<eos> Was is Terrowin that sent you?
- Please, Hazen!<eos> - You know, he's right.<eos> We don't need him.<eos> This man cares solely for himself.<eos> He's vile, selfish and speaks like a coward.<eos> - I pity your children.<eos> - They are not my children.<eos> Then they are lucky.<eos> If you want to reach home, you must follow the path of courage.<eos> And when the time is right it will lead you home.
He has a powerful weapon, Uncle.<eos> He called it:<eos> Gun right? The gun is out of bullets.<eos> - Then you must make some more.<eos> - I cannot make more bullets here.<eos> We have a decision to make.<eos> Ulrick spoke of your medallion.<eos> A magical medallion we believe Terrowin possess too.<eos> Maybe Terrowin carries your fate.<eos> I will leave you to rest.
- Yep.<eos> - We'll need to go to the armory.<eos> - You're right.<eos> We need every sword to defend ourselves.<eos> Yes. But first we will eat.<eos> Join me, Tybalt.<eos> You fought well today.<eos> Wasn't enough.<eos> Never is.<eos> What troubles you, Hazen?
We're all gonna die.<eos> Hazen, happy to see you.<eos> We need to take our men and head west to the forest.<eos> Where's west?<eos> I'm guessing towards the castle.<eos> Some Shaman you are.<eos> - Hey-yaw.<eos> - Yaw.<eos> ARCHERS!<eos> I will enjoy watching you suffer, as I did your mother all those years ago.
Understand that for none?<eos> Listen to the music!<eos> a new<eos> Dancer is in my house!<eos> Put their money in!<eos> That's what I mean all the time!<eos> Well, finally, man, damn it!<eos> Okay, Sassy sees us, the back door is open,<eos> John and I will go in here should be no problems,<eos> The rest of you, thinks Sassy, shall after forward, Get your act together merely nobody loses his head, no one does anything stupid,
- Oh. I see.<eos> If you get lost in there, give us a yell.<eos> Rules are rules.<eos> And you are ours.<eos> Mr. Gates.<eos> I need a moment with your boss.<eos> Not a good time.<eos> Get the fuck out.<eos> You want to run at first sign of trouble, be my guest, but don't expect me to fucking help you.<eos> And that goes for all of you.

Sooner than later, Nassau will be unable to sell to any legitimate market in the Americas.<eos> I don't want the men panicked about that when I need them focused on the Urca.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Can you hear yourself?<eos> You spent months lying to us about what it is we're hunting out here.<eos> And now when it's clear it can't possibly succeed, you want to keep lying.<eos> Maybe Singleton is right.<eos> Maybe it's time we made a change.<eos> Think carefully.<eos> What lies ahead, Mr. Singleton cannot see you through.
Come on!<eos> It's the stolen page.<eos> Friends, brothers... the prize that you and I have been pursuing... is L'Urca de Lima.<eos> The Hulk.<eos> A prize of almost unimaginable value.<eos> Now with this page securely in our possession, we can begin our hunt.<eos> And we will succeed no matter the cost. No matter the struggle.<eos> I will see that prize is yours.<eos> I'm not just gonna make you rich.<eos> I'm not just gonna make you strong.

I came here for the drawing.<eos> Me too. Let's get it over with.<eos> What about Vester?<eos> I will draw for Vester.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I said I'll draw for him.<eos> What did she say?<eos> I said I'll draw for Vester Belknap.<eos> Can we proceed?<eos> This is a painful occasion for you and your families and I grieve for you.
I need help. Surely you understand!<eos> He was suppose to hang.<eos> Mr.Svendsen.<eos> Get down of that wagon.<eos> Get down of that wagon right now! Or I'll shoot you where you sit.<eos> I can't do this alone.<eos> I need him.<eos> Get us moving.<eos> Boys don't have balls to hang me!<eos> You wanted my horse to do it for you, didn't ya?
You girls goto your room while I talk to your mama.<eos> Theoline, this is Mary Bee.<eos> Undo!<eos> Undo your hands?

What's your horse's name?<eos> Brown.<eos> You didn't give me the two dove's skinny blankets. It gets cold the night out here!<eos> You noticed.<eos> You need to head south-east, follow the river bottoms.<eos> No.<eos> We'll meet more people that way in case we need help.<eos> You know, there are three kinds of people out here...<eos> And you gonna meet wagon trains that don't want to see crazy people.<eos> You gonna meet traders who will surely rape you...

She wouldn't leave me out here!<eos> If you hadn't gone crazy, she wouldn't have made this trip<eos> If you had stayed steady and strong, she'd be alive... and at her home. In her own house.<eos> And so would you, but no.<eos> You went crazy and drove her crazy and it killed her.<eos> You do you gotta say about that?<eos> Well I'll be...<eos> I'm going' home by myself.<eos> You are on your own.<eos> Far enough long here East somebody will come along and attend to you.
But there is hardly anything Satisfying than honest work<eos> I find it impressive, if a man is not afraid roll up their sleeves.<eos> On the honest work!<eos> On the honest work!<eos> They come to you to pick up, Barbara!<eos> Stop that!<eos> Hey, my dad can stand you well,<eos> It's funny.<eos> Yes.<eos> Mike works for your old man schleimt a with the family, and before her Clearly mark you, marry you, Caitlin take over the shop here and you're a made man,
After you left, she got very close to Federov.<eos> But she wants to come in.<eos> She has something on him.<eos> Something that's scaring even her.<eos> - What?<eos> - A name.<eos> Claims it changes everything. And if she's right, how long before you think she's gonna join these?<eos> You go in, you get her out.<eos> Moscow to Petersburg.<eos> Cross the border to Helsinki, I'll meet you there.
Chechnya.<eos> This ugly, dirty, little godforsaken country.<eos> Oil, however, lots of it.<eos> Filthy Chechen terrorists didn't want to give it to us.<eos> So... one day, a building blew up.<eos> Good Russian soldiers with mommies and daddies back at home get sent back in pieces.<eos> And just like that, Federov got his dirty little war and Mother Russia got its oil.<eos> - You dropped the building?<eos> - No. Federov was smart enough to know that he couldn't handle an operation like that, keep it a secret.<eos> - We ran it for you?
He was at the request of Archbishop Langton himself.<eos> You say he was?<eos> He came here seeking peace.<eos> But when a young man witnesses what he did, it isn't found so easily.<eos> He was among us no more than a month.<eos> Do you know where he went?<eos> I hope to something he couldn't find here.<eos> I hear a brother saw him in Kingston a week ago.<eos> - Thank you, Father.<eos> - God bless you, my son.
You're still mine.<eos> Get in!<eos> HUBERT: Come on!<eos> Executioner, come on!<eos> Come on! Hurry up!<eos> Secure the gate!<eos> (CLANGING) (CLANGING CONTINUES)<eos> Come on!<eos> Master Hubert!<eos> We need you on the wall!

Raped and murdered by the English.<eos> Now my son is with them.<eos> - The last of my blood.<eos> - MAN: Kill them.<eos> How many of you know the same?<eos> We will fight you, English, the way you fight us.

Coordinated? What do you mean?

You don't know him. He'll never give up.<eos> It's only a game for him.<eos> I lost everything.<eos> He said he'd kill my family. Why didn't you tell this to the police?<eos> You let them think it was me. I was angry with you.<eos> God damn it, you promised!<eos> You promised to stop seeing her!<eos> So what do you think happened? She came over to my place.<eos> This Malankov followed her there?<eos> If you weren't seeing her behind my back... she wouldn't have been there in the first place, would she?
See ya round.<eos> There you are.<eos> Got a problem, have we?<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Fuck off!<eos> Are your ears painted on?<eos> You heard the man.<eos> - Fuck off, chunk!<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> Take your fucking poodles with you, you chunky cunt.

I'm doing what needs to be done.<eos> Get back here asap.<eos> - North provided this intel for a reason.<eos> - PFCS say nothing's out there.<eos> General, there was something embedded in his brain.<eos> I think the Heavies are using it for some kind of mind control.<eos> You have your orders.<eos> Follow them.<eos> Look, sir, you...<eos> What I'm about to ask you to do is in violation of a direct order.
Follow them.<eos> Look, sir, you...<eos> What I'm about to ask you to do is in violation of a direct order.<eos> I do not expect any one of you to burn for my decision, but I do believe that there is a real and imminent threat down there.<eos> We're all soldiers, and we all signed up for the same reason... to protect our families, to protect our friends, and to protect this planet.<eos> And those bastards are here to take that away from us.<eos> They are here to eliminate everything that we are and everything that we love.<eos> If your conscience is telling you to walk away, then I want you to walk away right now.<eos> But if you do leave here, you leave here with your head held high Because each and every one of you have earned that right.<eos> And I will always respect you for that.
- No time is easy time.<eos> - Yeah, sure. Hey, so is Mom around?<eos> Uh, nah...<eos> - Mm-mm.

Ah, shit!<eos> Family reunion!<eos> Hey, Uncle Ian.<eos> Hey, Uncle Ian.<eos> Jesus, you boys got tall.<eos> You got a little wide.<eos> And you started a little early.<eos> It's my day off, Beck!<eos> In fact, I was just down in Coopersville.<eos> I got you guys a special present, okay?
Of course. Of course.<eos> But if he keeps writing the way he is now he's gonna fill every wall in the house.<eos> That's very kind.<eos> You are a very nice man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I thought you were gonna be gruffer.<eos> Didn't you think he'd be gruffer?<eos> I was expecting a real SOB.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Can I borrow the two of you for just one moment?
What do you want?<eos> Guys, we gotta go for broke.<eos> We have to do the talent show.<eos> We don't take orders from you anymore. Yeah.<eos> You said it.<eos> We're tired of being bossed around all the time.<eos> Okay, I admit that lately on some select occasions, I may have been a little on the bossy side. Huh?<eos> Okay, okay, I've been a lot on the bossy side.<eos> You happy?<eos> And I shouldn't have bet that money without asking you all first.
O-tay!<eos> For Grandma.<eos> For Grandma!<eos> Come on, hurry, guys.<eos> Hello, Greenhaven!<eos> Please give a warm welcome for our host with the most,<eos> Mr. Leo McCarey!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the talent show!<eos> Who let you in here?
I'm...not going for tuition<eos> Why?<eos> I don't feel like it<eos> You know very well how poor your maths is<eos> Why must I be good at everything?<eos> So that you can study medicine, like your brother!<eos> I don't want to study medicine!<eos> What did you just say?<eos> You must! Look at all that we have done for you!<eos> I never asked you to!
- That's better, that's better ...<eos> - Why don't you stay over there?<eos> Done! Boom!<eos> Look at that ...<eos> That was an easy bet.<eos> - Damn straight!<eos> - Honey, I'm sorry ...<eos> Hard to lose, isn't it?<eos> Obviously, their tent's a lot less complicated than this one, so...<eos> Corey, how are those directions treating you?
Some lights floated, like, ten feet off the ground, right near Scott's truck.<eos> Might be a goddamn invasion.<eos> Thank you for coming back for us.<eos> Yeah, don't mention it.<eos> Shit!<eos> Alright, listen to me.<eos> Listen to me!<eos> Y'all gotta get out the truck.<eos> You head that way... you'll find a footpath, at the edge of the woods.<eos> Take the footpath, it's gonna drop you off right by the barn.
Get down!<eos> Priest!<eos> In!<eos> They're everywhere.<eos> But how many?<eos> Erlendur, do not be dismayed.<eos> Meet everything head-on.<eos> Whether we live or die today is already in the hands of the gods.<eos> They already know if we sup with them tonight, so fear not.<eos> Fight well, and if you fall, surely Odin will take you to Valhalla.
-To what, to rot?<eos> To rot?<eos> To die?<eos> Don't be so naive.<eos> You go on like a bloody adolescent!<eos> Like what's your man in Rebel Without A Cause.<eos> All I've ever done is treat you like a member of our family, but you know what?<eos> It's like you never accepted us.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Of course I've accepted you.
Well, how about I go and radio our captain and confirm that for you, huh?<eos> - Yeah, you do that.<eos> - Well, they've definitely got a Brooke.<eos> - Well, I wanna speak to whoever's on that radio.<eos> - Listen, now you hear me out.<eos> Just relax, hop back in your car and I will take you to your sister.<eos> - Just tell me where she is.<eos> - Look, mate, I don't even have time for this shit, alright?<eos> There are about a million things that I have to do right now. And you boys, you're pretty low on my priority list.<eos> So hop back in your car, and you follow me or don't.
Quite impressive.<eos> I'll make you a deal.<eos> This is a list of things I want.<eos> Things you are going to get for me.<eos> You complete this list by, let's say, 5:00 p.m., and deliver the goods to me.<eos> It's a lot.<eos> There's no way you can...<eos> Think of it as a challenge.<eos> If you succeed, maybe I forgive you.<eos> If you fail, you get a visit from these two.
All right, mate. So, what's the point?<eos> Most people have something in life they want bad enough that they'd break the law to get it.<eos> We just need to find out what it is and exploit it.<eos> - This is bollocks. - Worked on you.<eos> What's that supposed to mean, it worked on me?<eos> You hacked my fucking email?<eos> Yep.<eos> And Rafa's. What?<eos> You knew about this?<eos> I picked you both out.
- He knows. Am I going to lose my job?<eos> - What?<eos> - The prince used my phone.<eos> "Royal business," he said.<eos> Do you have any idea who it could have been?<eos> No, but the number is still here.<eos> - You sure about this? - These guys respect me, Rafa.<eos> They run a cash business.<eos> Hello, you're talking to a millionaire.<eos> You reckon I won't find you?
Yatesey!<eos> Where's the backup?<eos> Right, he's on the move.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Marcel's here now.<eos> Get down.<eos> Get us the fuck out of here now!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Drop the gun, right fucking now! Hey, fuck you!
Uh...<eos> I don't know what I'm gonna do. Commit suicide, maybe.<eos> Albert, I know everything seems hopeless right now, but I promise you, there's so much to live for.<eos> Really?<eos> Is there?<eos> What is there to live for on the frontier in 1882? Huh?<eos> Look, let me tell you something.<eos> We live in a terrible place and time.<eos> The American West is a disgusting, awful, dirty, dangerous place.<eos> Look around you.
I'm gonna get you a big old stack of fresh-cut steaks.<eos> I bet you'd like that. What?<eos> What's the matter with...<eos> Settle down, boy.<eos> Come on, boy, hey!<eos> Quiet down, Plugger!<eos> Whoa, mule!<eos> Howdy, folks.<eos> Howdy.<eos> What can I do for you fellas?
Hey, Clinch.<eos> Take a look.<eos> You'd lose half a day going through Bullhead.<eos> You, Enoch and Jordy will ride with me.<eos> We'll take Bilbee Pass to Sherman Creek Trail.<eos> And make no mistake about the kind of heat we're going to draw after we take that stage.<eos> Anna, I'm gonna keep you out of harm's way.<eos> Lewis, you take Anna and ride east and hole up here in, uh, Old Stump.<eos> You got that?<eos> We'll let things cool for a wee bit and then we'll come for you in 12 days.
You're gonna be fine.<eos> If I thought you were gonna lose this gunfight,<eos> I'd make you call it off. Okay?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Hey, how about it for the James Gang?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, hey, it's great to be back here in Old Stump.<eos> Any Indians here tonight?<eos> How'd you get tickets?
Hey, hey, it's great to be back here in Old Stump.<eos> Any Indians here tonight?<eos> How'd you get tickets?<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Scalpers.<eos> But I tell ya, folks, this telegraph machine...<eos> That thing is nuts.<eos> I mean, sure, it's faster than the Pony Express, but what good is it if you can't send a picture of your dick?<eos> Okay, they're giving me the lantern.<eos> Enjoy the bison and I hope you're enjoying your drinks as much as my horse enjoyed making them for you.
Did you dress like her on purpose?<eos> Kind of.<eos> And, incidentally, sir, we both really wanted to thank you for dinner last night.<eos> And for the champagne.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> It was magical.<eos> We bought them dinner last night?<eos> It was our pleasure.<eos> You've come a long way.<eos> What can I do for you?
Don't!<eos> This way please.<eos> Here with that gun! Rin?<eos> I will distract them, please run.<eos> I have been told since I was a child that I should protect the Genpou family with my life.<eos> My family has lived for that purpose alone for generations.<eos> Therefore, please run,<eos> my Lady Shiori. Rin!<eos> You ...<eos> That day I failed to protect my Lord and Lady. Even you were taken away. I had thought about ending my life,
You could not possibly plan to save everyone in your current state.<eos> The security code that butler inserted.<eos> Could it be Hanae's birthday?<eos> Perhaps father's birthday?<eos> You will not be able to take you revenge like this.<eos> Are you really fine with that?<eos> Father... mother...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It seems like I've ended up serving a most boring master.<eos> Seeing as you have chosen death yourself, I am under no obligation to protect you.
Mindy!<eos> It's none of your business.<eos> Of course it is. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> There's nothing wrong with Provincetown.<eos> - Have a seat.<eos> - Everything okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just wanted to talk to you.<eos> Now, we invited you all here today because, well, you're family.

I'll go on my own.<eos> Joey asleep?<eos> I think he and Vlad are still studying.<eos> Vlad?<eos> What's Vlad doing here?<eos> Not studying.<eos> Well, I think I'll take a look.<eos> Don't go.<eos> Why not?<eos> Last year, you two were complaining that Joey didn't have any friends.
I told Olivier everything.<eos> - What?<eos> - Well, everything.<eos> Us, May 10 and... And the rest.<eos> The rest?<eos> Can you be more specific?<eos> - I don't want to cause trouble.<eos> - Hang on. It isn't a problem at all.<eos> We had some good times, but nothing to...<eos> Besides, I'm delighted for you two.
I remember your first kiss.<eos> In the crowd, remember?<eos> The evening of May 10, when you sang on stage.<eos> The blue towel.<eos> Léon...<eos> Sorry.<eos> No, I am.<eos> I shouldn't have brought it up.<eos> Hello.<eos> Looks like you're having fun.
No. You've got a cold.<eos> On July 12?<eos> That's it!<eos> France is world champion!<eos> It's awesome.<eos> After witnessing this,<eos> I can die peacefully. Well, at a ripe old age...<eos> I saw a lot of Raymond over the years and always enjoyed our conversations immensely.<eos> We discussed everything except religion.<eos> Most of the time, he talked about you, Olivier, Léon, of whom he was proud.
After witnessing this,<eos> I can die peacefully. Well, at a ripe old age...<eos> I saw a lot of Raymond over the years and always enjoyed our conversations immensely.<eos> We discussed everything except religion.<eos> Most of the time, he talked about you, Olivier, Léon, of whom he was proud.<eos> He followed your careers closely.<eos> He told me his doubts.<eos> Because yes... in his humility, he feared he had failed in his duties.<eos> And yet he was an admirable father.<eos> And courageous, when he had to raise you alone after your mum died.
You are among the most extreme.<eos> I am one of the ultimate.<eos> And the main school can be the ultimate.<eos> Do not speak, do not think.<eos> Do not think.<eos> Go, Miss Julie.<eos> There is no other way.<eos> Go.<eos> Wait!<eos> I'm sending you out in the world.
It's natural, but very soon you'll begin to feel that this is your home... and that we are like your parents and siblings.<eos> To remove the fear, there's nothing better than entrusting yourself to God, Our Lord, and Our Lady.<eos> I need you to come here every Monday at 5PM to get spiritual help.<eos> I absolve you of all your sins in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<eos> - Go in peace.<eos> God wants to do great things for you.<eos> I love you very much.<eos> Alberto.<eos> Alberto.<eos> Now, dear brothers, I invite you to participate in the foot washing that reminds us of the love, humility, and service of our Lord Jesus Christ.
I need to talk to you about the tablet.<eos> What the heck is Short Stack doing here?<eos> Hey, Gus.<eos> You're looking well.<eos> Reginald.<eos> Are you here to frame us again?<eos> Send us back to the slammer?<eos> I didn't frame you.<eos> You were actually stealing.<eos> And I was the one that got you out of jail, so...
We're gonna go around it.<eos> We're gonna go around now, or else we're gonna lose the signal.<eos> Come on.<eos> Iiepwop.<eos> Pompeii!<eos> Iiepwop.<eos> Are you sure you're reading that right, pal?<eos> Pompeii!<eos> "Pompeii."<eos> "Ask not what your country can do for you...
Wait, shouldn't we keep looking for Jed and Octavius?<eos> Nick is right.<eos> A true knight never shirks his duties.<eos> If we don't get to Egypt soon we're not gonna save anybody.<eos> Dada say, "Stay!"<eos> Stay!<eos> Dada say Laaa no eat.<eos> Stay, Laaa!<eos> This is it.<eos> Perhaps I should accompany you in.
That means you guys would have to stay.<eos> We belong in New York.<eos> Yeah, but if you...<eos> If you guys go, then you... you won't be alive after tonight.<eos> We're museum exhibits, Laredo.<eos> It's what we are.<eos> Folks come to look at us, maybe learn a little something.<eos> That's alive, man.<eos> But I'm...<eos> I'm supposed to take care of you guys.
The moment he touched her, he was mine.<eos> But since you did, you sweet ass too.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Better luck next time, old friend.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> - Whatever can serve as a weapon.<eos> Something like that?<eos> This will be enough.<eos> I can smell you, my little meat sacks.
So excessive.<eos> This makes sick.<eos> The longer you populate this world, the easier my job is.<eos> That killing, these lies, these deceptions.<eos> Sin to sin.<eos> Ts, ts, ts.<eos> The world is falling apart.<eos> If you think about it, i do to both of you a favor.<eos> I redeem you from your pathetic existence.<eos> To get you all together, it was like a gift by..

You talk German! I can't talk Spanish?<eos> Bible, what country we in?<eos> Germany.<eos> Germany, they speak German.<eos> Could you explain to him it's a tool of war?<eos> It's a tool of war, Gordo.<eos> Here's my tool of war.<eos> Top.<eos> You knew German before we got in this fucking war! Don't play stupid with me.<eos> I expect all of you to pull your shit together.
Or roll your eyes.<eos> Yeah, I probably would've.<eos> Then.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Surprise!<eos> - Happy birthday!<eos> - Happy birthday, Mom!<eos> We got you.<eos> Happy birthday!<eos> I love you all so much, and you're so wonderful.
All the children are dead.<eos> This was the Rapture.<eos> You need to understand that there is only one way to God.<eos> Only one way to eternal life.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> - Stop what you're doing, get down on your...<eos> - I got it, I got it!<eos> Something hit the front. Something hit the front.<eos> You don't act for God.<eos> The power of Christ compels you!
But we have hope in the path to the Father and his gift of eternal life.<eos> You have to make a choice, Tommy.<eos> And what are you going to do?<eos> I'm going to be a pastor for the first time in my life.<eos> For those of you whom I haven't met, I am Pastor Shay.<eos> And I have been a fraud.<eos> It's true.<eos> I walk through this sanctuary with my soul asleep.<eos> In Matthew, Jesus said there will be those who use his name in fancy speeches and sermons, and Jesus said unto them,<eos> "I never knew you."
For those with more serious medical conditions, please report to the triage area outside our hospital tent, where you can be evaluated and treated in a timely manner.<eos> If you have any further questions, please ask any uniformed military personnel stationed throughout the area.<eos> You think that's where they're setting up the church?<eos> I heard they're bringing in a chaplain.<eos> It's the group from the church.<eos> You made it.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Come and get warm.<eos> Warm yourself here, huh?<eos> It's good to see you.
And, urn, lavatories are just through the door where we came in, so you don't have to go through the main bar to access the facilities.<eos> May I?<eos> - Wants to be a waitress.<eos> - Sommelier.<eos> Gentlemen, let's start this again, shall we?<eos> Now just a bit of housekeeping to go through... Boo! Yes, before we get onto the proper business of the evening, getting chateaued beyond belief!<eos> Chunder bag.<eos> It's our time, gentlemen.<eos> Let us eat till we explode, drink till our eyes fall out, let us dance footloose upon the Earth, and carpe some fucking diem!<eos> We who are about to dine, salute you.
Yeah, I do.<eos> We've generated a lot of energy over the past few weeks, and now I think we're gonna be able to do something with it.<eos> I just don't know what that could be.<eos> And it very well could be destructive.<eos> Charlotte.<eos> How're you doing?<eos> Guys.<eos> - This is Simon.<eos> - Hey, I'm Simon. How're you doing?<eos> - Nice to meet you. - And you.
- Thanks.<eos> Wh-What's that?<eos> The thing that we do each evening for each other.<eos> And actually, I kind of don't think I'll be able to do it properly.<eos> Well, n-not 'cause I'm here?<eos> No, I just...<eos> It's fine.<eos> - Let's skip it tonight. - Oh, really?<eos> It's not a problem.<eos> I don't... I don't want to stop you guys doing what you normally do.
Yes, ambulance, quickly, please to, erm...<eos> - Lottie, where exactly is Granddad now?<eos> - Out at sea.<eos> - Out at sea?<eos> - And on fire.<eos> He wanted a Viking funeral, so we built a raft, put the body on it, set it on fire and floated him out to sea.<eos> Can you hold on a sec?<eos> Stop being silly, just tell us, where is Granddad?<eos> This is a wind-up.<eos> He's put you up to this, hasn't he?
He'd certainly have laughed at Margaret's starring role on YouTube.<eos> 4,458,207 hits at last count.<eos> Three of them mine.<eos> And me, he'd have laughed at me.<eos> A lot.<eos> And my main regret, apart from not having a bit more time with Dad, is that he couldn't see us all running around like idiots.<eos> I'm sure many of you believe that he can see us, but for my part, I think death is it.<eos> I, er, I think life...<eos> This life is all you get, and Gordie McLeod had a hell of a life, and so should we cos that's all death is good for.<eos> It's to give us a kick up the arse and say, "Get on with it, and love those around you."
[ Southern accent ] Well, I told the coordinating committee what you asked for, and the response was very positive.<eos> Of course, they need to clear about 15 other committees every time we go over a million dollars.<eos> Look, boys, we know you're good in Herat.<eos> The question is, how do we help you out in Panjshir? [ Speaking native language ]<eos> We have a route on the Rukha... on the Saricha road.<eos> You get the weapons to us from across the border, we do the rest.<eos> Right.<eos> [ Speaking native language ] We love America.<eos> With your guidance and with the help of Allah, we will drive the godless Soviets from Afghanistan.<eos> And we are gonna be there for you every step of the way.
America is gonna get you whatever you need, Salar.<eos> It's good to have the same enemy. Yes, it is.<eos> This blade is my gift to you.<eos> I killed a Russian soldier with it.<eos> It was the first man I ever killed.<eos> It was hard, but it has gotten easier.<eos> We'll kill every heathen come to humiliate us on our own land.<eos> Really?<eos> [ Glass shatters ] You tell your brothers back in Afghanistan there is a message for them. [ Muffled gunshot ]<eos> America can't protect you, Allah can't protect you, and the KGB is everywhere.
Well, maybe next year, you know?<eos> Hopefully you can afford it, because this is your 100% refund.<eos> I really wasn't expecting anything back.<eos> Definitely not all of it.<eos> Well, I'm just sorry it took so long, but the airline has this whole voucher BS, so it takes forever, but that's no reason to pay for a trip you're not gonna go on.<eos> [ Party horn blows ] Thanks.<eos> I definitely owe you one.<eos> It's great she's back, huh?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> It's good to see you guys together again.
It's just a brush pass.<eos> He's got two tails on his surveillance team about five feet behind him.<eos> They won't look twice at a father with his child, but you alone they might notice.<eos> You need the cover.<eos> We have to move.<eos> Leanne will block for you.<eos> After you get it, do 45 minutes of clearing on your own, then bring the package to my hotel, room 1123.<eos> I may have to run the kids somewhere, so wait for me if I'm not back there.<eos> His operational report sounds bad.<eos> I'm gonna need you guys' help to take out his surveillance team so I can get him out.
Willy!<eos> Hello.<eos> Robert gave me your address.<eos> I'm here because Juliette and I saw Dumont.<eos> He's agreed to a new ballot Monday.<eos> Because Jean-Marc spoke to some people to scare them.<eos> I wanted to ask if you'd agree to vote for me to keep myjob.<eos> I didn't vote against you, I voted for my bonus.<eos> Dumont put one against the other, not me.<eos> I know. It's sick forcing you to choose.
Jean-Marc influenced the vote by saying stuff to people to scare them.<eos> - I wanted...<eos> - What did he say?<eos> That Dumont wanted to lay off staff.<eos> If it wasn't me, it'd be someone else.<eos> Who did he say that to?<eos> Three or four people at least.<eos> I don't know who but Juliette does.<eos> She knows everything, that one.<eos> I wanted to ask if you'd vote on Monday for me to stay.

What do the others say?<eos> Juliette, Robert, Kader and Timur will vote for me to stay.<eos> I still have eight to see, you two included.<eos> Maybe Jean-Marc called you to tell you<eos> I couldn't work like before after my depression.<eos> It's not true.<eos> I'm in shape.<eos> I don't want you laid off but my bonus is a lot of money.<eos> I know.<eos> I didn't force this decision on you.
I'm not pissing anyone else off.<eos> Jean-Marc's right. I'm not up to it anymore.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Your phone...<eos> Hello?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Yes, she's just next to me.<eos> It's Maxime.<eos> That's good.<eos> Dad will tell you. He'II fetch you this evening.
Hello?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Yes, she's just next to me.<eos> It's Maxime.<eos> That's good.<eos> Dad will tell you. He'II fetch you this evening.<eos> Kiss your sister for me.<eos> No, put her on.<eos> How's it going?<eos> I just wanted to give you a kiss and say Dad will fetch you.
Please! Go now!<eos> My pistol!<eos> Armand!<eos> How wonderful to see you!<eos> It's chilly in here, my dear. Is it?<eos> I'm rather hot.<eos> Oh, come here, my love...<eos> I can't stay for long.<eos> Affairs of state.<eos> But I hardly get to see you these days.
Oh, I don't know, let's think.<eos> Because she's the mistress of the most powerful man in France?<eos> Gentlemen, I love her.<eos> You love her?<eos> Or you love stealing what belongs to the Cardinal?<eos> You three!<eos> My office.<eos> Now.<eos> He looks happy.<eos> I've had complaints. An allegation you've been duelling with the Cardinal's Red Guards.
You three!<eos> My office.<eos> Now.<eos> He looks happy.<eos> I've had complaints. An allegation you've been duelling with the Cardinal's Red Guards.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Let me think...<eos> No.<eos> Because... that would be illegal.<eos> I can't protect you from the Cardinal if you keep fighting his men.
There's something about shooting that makes a man feel fully alive.<eos> Unlike the birds, I suppose.<eos> They're born to be shot, like rabbits... and poets.<eos> Now!<eos> Good shot, Your Majesty.<eos> Good enough for the Musketeers, Treville?<eos> My men are professional soldiers, Your Majesty.<eos> You should try flattery sometimes. It plays very well around here.<eos> I have always told Your Majesty the truth, and always will.<eos> That's why I like you, Treville.
Get him!<eos> He's a murderer! Stop him!<eos> Stop him!<eos> Ooh! I'll give you five livres to kiss me.<eos> That actually worked...<eos> Agh! Oh, you degenerate!<eos> Touch me again, and I'll gut you like a fish.<eos> My apologies, Mademoiselle.<eos> It's Madame.<eos> Madame! I won't trouble you any further.
That's my problem.<eos> Now, will you tell me the way to the Musketeers' Garrison or not?<eos> You're in no shape to fight, if that's what you're thinking of.<eos> I have three older brothers.<eos> I know that look in a man's eye.<eos> With respect, that's none of your business.<eos> You made it my business when you fell at my feet.<eos> You're a beautiful woman.<eos> I'm sure you're used to it.<eos> I should have just left you in the gutter.
I usually remember the men I kill.<eos> That name means nothing to me.<eos> Then you're a liar as well!<eos> Remarkable.<eos> He's keeping up with Athos.<eos> Rubbish. He just doesn't want to hurt the lunatic.<eos> That's enough!<eos> That could have been your throat.<eos> Don't make me kill you over a mistake.<eos> I didn't kill your father and I don't want to kill you.
Don't make me kill you over a mistake.<eos> I didn't kill your father and I don't want to kill you.<eos> Athos!<eos> And that could have been your back.<eos> Now, fight me or die on your knees!<eos> I don't care which.<eos> No?<eos> He said, enough.<eos> Very well.<eos> I'll fight both of you.
Now, for God's sake, put up your sword.<eos> You'll have to kill me for it.<eos> Lively little bugger, aren't ya?<eos> Stop fighting!<eos> All of you!<eos> Is three against one fair?<eos> We weren't going to kill him.<eos> Weren't we?<eos> Next time, let us know.<eos> Madame Bonacieux, what are you doing here?
- Don't say another word.<eos> If only men would think instead of fight, there might be more good ones left.<eos> Him, I'm not sure about. Her, I like.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Did you find Cornet?<eos> He never made it to the monastery.<eos> Give us 20 men and we'll search the road to Chartres.<eos> Athos, I'm sorry.<eos> These men have come to arrest you.
You asked me to help you discredit the Musketeers. I have done so.<eos> And you've been well paid for it.<eos> There are others who will pay.<eos> But my loyalty is to you.<eos> Let that be enough.<eos> Our plan did not include the murder of the Spanish traitor, Mendoza.<eos> He was still useful to me.<eos> He was a bad lover and a terrible bore.<eos> Mendoza betrayed his country for a handful of gold and a place in my bed.<eos> In due course, he would have betrayed you as well.
I'm all yours.<eos> Clear enough?<eos> Five sous? Five? !<eos> All right, ten.<eos> But that's it.<eos> Fine!<eos> Oi, my turn next!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Ten sous?<eos> Shame on you.
And I'll make it up to you, I promise.<eos> Dig in.<eos> (SINGING) Jingle bells, jingles bells, jingle all the way.<eos> Oh, what fun...<eos> What's going on here then?<eos> Evening, gents.<eos> Welcome to Wonderland, Alice.<eos> Get this place all set up.<eos> Gentlemen, this is the moment you've been training for.<eos> But to refresh your memories and update you on the current situation, the first part of our wonderful plan went largely to plan, so thank you.
However, we did lose a couple of guys, so everybody needs to focus.<eos> We're now down to 28 men, including myself and Dalton.<eos> We got about 10 minutes 'fore the police get here, so everybody make sure the house guests are settled in.<eos> Get comfortable, because for the next 12 hours or so, this place is your home.<eos> It's your castle. It's your fucking fortress and you are gonna protect it with your lives.<eos> With only one way in and the same way out, our subterranean home is 15 levels and a set of offices.<eos> We do, however, have an unforeseen situation.<eos> We always knew that two businesses worked in the building... an investment firm and a telesales company.<eos> What we didn't anticipate was, it being Christmas Even, that the bloody telesales company would still fucking be here, continuing to work late into Christmas Eve.<eos> I need you to break into teams, check every floor.
About that.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> I need a favor.<eos> You promised us a score.<eos> That I did.<eos> And now there's no score.<eos> There would not appear to be, no.<eos> This ain't no joke, Jack.<eos> 5,000 pesos of our money is gone and someone's got to answer for it.<eos> I assure you all what happened last night was as disappointing to me as it was to you.
You did this.<eos> Listen to me very carefully.<eos> You are, all of you, this whole crew, as of right now finished!<eos> You will not sell anything.<eos> You will not buy anything.<eos> You will not eat anything.<eos> Eleanor.<eos> Unless-- unless you decide right now to elect yourselves a new captain.<eos> Unless you decide to join the crew of Captain Flint.<eos> You will join his crew and you will grant him disposal of your ship.
Do you want a bottle of water?<eos> No, I'll be fine.<eos> One month.<eos> That's the home stretch, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've just got something in my throat.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> I think that's the nicest procession I've ever seen.<eos> Boys and girls, we are so proud of you.
I don't know, what's happening?<eos> I'm not your wife.<eos> Okay.<eos> What the fuck's going on, and who are you?<eos> He fell in love with her.<eos> He's not supposed to fall in love with her. She's supposed to fall out of love with you.<eos> That's how this works. That's how we get out.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I don't... - That's how we become you.<eos> - You become us? Pitting you against each other is the best way to break you down, and then it's your turn to stay.
Go now.<eos> There was no need for that.<eos> Don't go over the top.<eos> But it's not so simple.<eos> That's why I'm telling you.<eos> Hidayet.<eos> How's that? Happy?<eos> Is that all right now?<eos> A slap for a broken window.<eos> Is that enough for you two?
Why stay here all alone?<eos> Me?<eos> Heaven forbid.<eos> I can't stand that English husband saying "Oh lovely" to everything.<eos> Just don't talk like that.<eos> So, let me tell Nihal. I was saying to Suavi<eos> I got a letter the other day.<eos> A young girl who teaches needlecraft in a local village.<eos> In short, she's asking for help.<eos> I'm not sure how to respond, so I thought I'd ask you two.
Why?<eos> It's quite a long way.<eos> Yes, it's far.<eos> It is. Isn't it?<eos> Did you walk the last time too?<eos> I mean yesterday.<eos> Yes.<eos> My goodness.<eos> Why didn't you say so?<eos> Hidayet could have given you a lift back.
- Really?<eos> You come often.<eos> I've heard about you.<eos> I'm not sure what you're doing...<eos> Mrs Nihal could explain it better, but we're collecting donations to renovate disadvantaged schools.<eos> Since Mrs Nihal joined, we've made a lot of progress.<eos> - That's nice.<eos> Bravo.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Friends, why don't you sit down?
- No TV in background we could agree.<eos> We played 10 minutes.<eos> Poor ten minutes of relaxation in a day of crazy. I waited 20 minutes by caterers that Mrs is not done shit to cook.<eos> - Mrs. works as hard as you.<eos> And besides, she has her period.<eos> - Very stylish.<eos> Enjoy your meal.<eos> - The high class mom.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I'll let you dinner with Marcel Rufo.
- It can be light, some tonight?<eos> We will not divorce? Why do the face?<eos> This is stupid.<eos> - You know what, we will not get divorced?<eos> - I know, that's all. I love you, you love me, come on.<eos> It makes short.<eos> - No. It's too easy.<eos> - No, it is not easy.<eos> - Do not your dog.<eos> - You are not required you talk like that.
You should have driven faster.<eos> Right.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, just one last thing before the evening begins properly.<eos> Apologies for earlier, a crisis arose and was dealt with.<eos> More importantly, however, today we saw two people make vows.<eos> I've never made a vow in my life and after tonight I never will again.<eos> So, here in front of you all, my first and last vow.<eos> Mary and John, whatever it takes, whatever happens, from now on, I swear I will always be there.<eos> Always.<eos> For all three of you. Erm...

Why?<eos> Because you won't love me when you've finished and I don't want to see that happen.<eos> How much do you know already?<eos> By your skill set, you are, or were, an intelligence agent.<eos> Your accent is currently English, but I suspect you are not.<eos> You're on the run from something. You've used your skills to disappear.<eos> Magnussen knows your secret, which is why you were going to kill him.<eos> And I assume you befriended Janine in order to get close to him.<eos> Oh, you can talk!<eos> Oh, look at you two, you should have got married.
Magic.<eos> No, bedroom window was open.<eos> Hi, Jenn.<eos> What part of "stay away" do you guys not understand?<eos> The "stay away" part.<eos> I just don't get it. You're not invited up here.<eos> Despite whatever this one may have told you.<eos> Hey, come on, come on.<eos> We parked the car down the road so you wouldn't hear us.<eos> Besides, we missed you guys.
We tossed something on the porch and something's glad that we did it.<eos> What are you thinkin'?<eos> All I know is that thing is dead, guys, come on.<eos> Can we please go swimming now? Yeah, I second that.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You still want to go in the water after what happened last night?<eos> Last night was in there, okay?<eos> The water's way safer than in the cabin. Yeah, come on.<eos> It's a beautiful day and the lake's right over here.<eos> We haven't seen you ladies in your bikinis yet. Come on.
Fuck me.<eos> Baby, come on.<eos> Get there.<eos> Open up!<eos> The doors all boarded up.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You know why the fuck why!<eos> Well, hurry up.<eos> You guys.<eos> Hey, you guys. Hey you guys, you'd better turn around!
Previously on Californication...<eos> I have decided to go abroad, for an indeterminate amount of time.<eos> I want to make a literary pilgrimage.<eos> Watching her go, I don't know, it kind of feels like the end of something.<eos> It makes you wonder if she was the only thing that was still keeping us together.<eos> We're gettin' married.<eos> - Ahh!<eos> - The Runkles!<eos> I now pronounce you wife and early man.
Come on, change your clothes.<eos> We got ourselves a meeting.<eos> - Where?<eos> Where? - I'll tell you on the way.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> You, kid, outta here.<eos> - Wait...<eos> - Just...<eos> Can I...<eos> Can I come with you guys?
He was a survivalist, I guess you'd call it.<eos> Had some pretty fucking strange ideas.<eos> Oh, there's nothing like the night sky out there, though.<eos> I couldn't handle the cold, so I headed back to South Texas, 'cause all I could remember was at least it never got cold.<eos> My old man always made like I let him down that way.<eos> Said I had no loyalty.<eos> A clean break is best now, while they're still young.<eos> Look, it's none of my business, okay.<eos> But I do need him to watch my back on this.<eos> This is how you all get warped.
My bad.<eos> I come through for you on this tonight, I gotta know you're gonna hook me up.<eos> 'Cause I got a real job I was supposed to be doing.<eos> You got my word.<eos> You back me on this, I back you.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Up and at 'em, eggplant!<eos> Motherfuckers.<eos> Fuck you!

Just observation and deduction.<eos> I see a propensity for obesity, poverty, a yen for fairy tales.<eos> Folks putting what few bucks they do have into little wicker baskets being passed around.<eos> I think it's safe to say that nobody here's gonna be splitting the atom, Marty.<eos> You see that?<eos> Your fucking attitude.<eos> Not everybody wants to sit alone in an empty room beating off to murder manuals.<eos> Some folks enjoy community, a common good.<eos> Yeah, but if the common good's got to make up fairy tales, then ifs not good for anybody.<eos> Your sorrows pin you to this place.

I'll never forget it, never! And now? You've won.<eos> You've got him all to yourself.<eos> How can you burden such a man with your vulgar little ideas of love?<eos> How could you be so stupid and ignore reality?<eos> You walked out on my husband every time things got serious! You threw yourself at him and then you ran off.<eos> We swore an oath to share everything.<eos> What was I to share with you?<eos> The night you spent together in Tübingen?<eos> The men you keep on a leash like a dog?<eos> You lead the love life of a bankrupt feudal mistress. In France you'd be put to the guillotine.
I'm gonna go make my rounds on the other end.<eos> I'll check back with you in about 20 minutes.<eos> I didn't know Audrey's dad's a cop.<eos> I didn't mean no disrespect. Yes, sir.<eos> We didn't mean any disrespect.<eos> Audrey's 16.<eos> We got you on statch rape. You know that, right?
We got you on statch rape. You know that, right?<eos> You know what happens to pretty boys like you who go up to The Farm on statch charges?<eos> Look at that. Door come open.<eos> Y'all want to step out a bit? Take some air'?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I think that you're a little angry right now.<eos> You telling me how I feel?<eos> That's patronizing.<eos> Two choices.<eos> We do this here with an understanding that not you or any of your river rat boys comes within 100 yards of my daughter.
I got something coming for you, baby.<eos> Your psycho bit don't cut me, boy.<eos> You hear me?<eos> What the fuck? Hey!<eos> I strike you as more of a talker or a doer, Steve?<eos> That's my fucking car!<eos> God damn it!<eos> L'chaim, fat-ass.<eos> You motherfuckers!<eos> Fuck you!
One of them matched our Lake Charles case. Another matched Dora Lange's wounds.<eos> Had his prints.<eos> Look, man, we owe you on this collar.<eos> How's Rust?<eos> He hasn't woke up.<eos> Been in a coma since surgery.<eos> They came by when you first got here.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> - Hi.<eos> It's so good to see you all.

We came to get you, Chao we're leaving for Mass.<eos> Coming.<eos> Never mind.<eos> You're going to Mass?<eos> -Sure guys, gotta be open minded!<eos> - What a Chinaman!<eos> Chief of the ball-lickers!<eos> Look who's here, the United Colors of Benetton family!<eos> I'm so pleased you all came.<eos> Well it's important for you Catholics! We're so glad to share it with the family.
What's the lucky man's name? Charles.<eos> Like Charles de Gaulle?<eos> Um, yeah.<eos> Tell me he's Catholic.<eos> - Is he Catholic?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he's Catholic.<eos> So, you'll marry in a church, then?<eos> Certainly, his family is very religious. - Ahh!<eos> But I need to let you know something, first.
- Yes?<eos> - Body bag, sir.<eos> Correct.<eos> Charlie, isn't it?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Good.<eos> In a moment, you will each collect a body bag.<eos> You will write your name on that bag.<eos> You will write the details of your next of kin on that bag.<eos> This represents your acknowledgment of the risks that you are about to face... as well as your agreement to strict confidentiality.
Now, that's what you call a secret, right?<eos> You know what?<eos> Fuck it.<eos> We need to speed things up.<eos> Bring the product release forward.<eos> We're only halfway into production... and speeding it will cost a fortune.<eos> Do I look like I give a fuck?<eos> Just get it done.<eos> As some of you will have learned last night... teamwork is paramount here at Kingsman.<eos> We're here to enhance your skills, test you to the limit.

Then I suggest you make my alias somebody worth kidnapping.<eos> Fuck, fuck, fuck!<eos> What, don't like heights?<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> I've done it before, which is probably why, come to think of it.<eos> Hey, it's gonna be all right.<eos> You're top of the class.<eos> Listen up.<eos> Your mission is to land in the target without the radar detecting you.<eos> If I read you on the radar, or you miss the target, you go home.
This is why, when Apostle Paul said,<eos> "I no longer live, but Christ lives in me"<eos> he meant that when a man lets Christ into his soul - in other words, begins to think like Christ, see like Christ and act like the Lord commanded - only then does this man possess truth.<eos> And that means he can regard events and see their true meaning and tell good from evil.<eos> And that is the essence of truth.<eos> When people destroy crosses, break icons, defile the Crucifix and blaspheme by calling demonic rites a prayer, when people try to convince others that they do this out of good intentions, they are passing off lies as the truth.<eos> How can one preach freedom while destroying the foundations of morality?<eos> Freedom is finding God's truth.<eos> The Bible teaches us this.<eos> Know God's truth, and it shall set you free.
Last time he put them anywhere.<eos> If you take it, they'll give it.<eos> Why do you say these things?<eos> You were the one who threw me to them in the first place.<eos> I only thought they'd kill you.<eos> Do you feel that soreness between your haunches?<eos> Yeah, well, that's what you get when you let some cunt who's never raised a sail, set foot on a deck tell you your business!<eos> Next thing you know, she'll have her boot on your throat and her hand in your fucking pocket.<eos> I think he's talking about you.<eos> That's what you get when you're letting a wench tell you...
It helped.<eos> Miranda Barlow?<eos> Away from the hatch!<eos> Everyone!<eos> Captain Flint.<eos> He says, "I'm secure in the hold below."<eos> "With 20 of my men. I can wait, but you cannot."<eos> "Before departing,<eos> I sent a message to the captain of the Scarborough.<eos> I told him where I was headed, and I told him where he would find you."
Wild lemons on a purple field,<eos> House Dalt of Lemonwood.<eos> A vulture grasping a baby in its talons, House Blackmont.<eos> A crowned skull, the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.<eos> Boy knows his Dornish Houses.<eos> I need a sigil.<eos> And House Martell, a red sun pierced by a spear?<eos> I don't see it, my lord.<eos> Well met, my lords.<eos> His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name.
I don't see Prince Doran in your company.<eos> The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear.<eos> He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.<eos> Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast.<eos> Will he?<eos> And where is Prince Oberyn?<eos> Arrived before dawn.<eos> Not a man for welcome parties, our prince.<eos> Very well.<eos> My lords, these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep.
My lady.<eos> Please pardon me for interrupting.<eos> My name is Brienne of Tarth.<eos> We know who you are.<eos> We've heard all about you.<eos> But hearing is one thing.<eos> Aren't you just marvelous?<eos> Absolutely singular.<eos> I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is.<eos> My lady, I know this is a very busy time for you, but if I could just have a moment.
- You made a promise.<eos> To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead.<eos> To keep them safe.<eos> Well, Arya Stark hasn't been seen since her father was killed.<eos> Where do you think she is?<eos> My money's on dead.<eos> There's a certain safety in death, wouldn't you say?<eos> And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister.<eos> Bit of a complication.<eos> A complication does not release you from a vow.
I don't care if he ate your friend.<eos> We're not going in there.<eos> Come on, give it up.<eos> Come here.<eos> - Let's have a feel there.<eos> - Leave it.<eos> Come here.<eos> Please, she's a good girl.<eos> Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.<eos> I know you.

She already told your sister.<eos> It's only a matter of time before your father hears.<eos> So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden.<eos> My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.<eos> No, I will not.<eos> How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying?<eos> I have no pet sellsword to protect me.<eos> No legendary brother to avenge me.<eos> Only little birds who whisper in my ear.<eos> Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
I have friends across the sea who could help her.<eos> She won't leave.<eos> I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it.<eos> Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with.<eos> Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?<eos> From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach,<eos> Your Grace, it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup.<eos> May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.<eos> A handsome goblet, my lord.<eos> Or shall I call you Father?
- Widow's Wail.<eos> - Wolfsbane.<eos> - Widow's Wail.<eos> I like that.<eos> Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off<eos> Ned Stark's head all over again.<eos> Don't.<eos> You want me on the desk?<eos> - What's wrong, my lion? - Don't call me that.<eos> What should I call you?
Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.<eos> Ser Loras, it's quite all right.<eos> Your sister looks very beautiful.<eos> As does yours.<eos> So, looking forward to your wedding?<eos> Yes, very much.<eos> Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.<eos> They certainly are.<eos> Perhaps they should get married.<eos> If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep.
I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.<eos> I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune.<eos> The country has been at war too long.<eos> I hope your reign is long and peaceful.<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I hope we see more of you.<eos> Lady Brienne.<eos> You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter.<eos> That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid.<eos> I'm sure you have many fascinating stories.<eos> Sworn to Renly Baratheon.<eos> Sworn to Catelyn Stark.<eos> And now my brother.<eos> Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.<eos> I don't serve your brother, Your Grace.<eos> But you love him.<eos> Your Grace.<eos> No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally.
Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice--<eos> You should see Qyburn.<eos> He's quite good.<eos> - Your Grace.<eos> - Qyburn?<eos> Deplorable man.<eos> Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.<eos> More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?<eos> Your Grace, I am a man of learning.<eos> My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him.
It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.<eos> Please give him our regards.<eos> With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again.<eos> They call it the rich man's disease.<eos> A wonder you don't have it.<eos> Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.<eos> People everywhere have their differences.<eos> In some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth.<eos> In other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful.<eos> What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place.
Boston is more forgiving of one's past.<eos> With my family's assistance, one might find a new life there.<eos> Captain Bryson sailed the Velasco route for 10 years and was never boarded.<eos> He's in a reinforced hold.<eos> There's no way to get the guns off the boat.<eos> Anybody we send down there is just gonna get cut to shreds.<eos> Mr. Guthrie's orders were explicit.<eos> No matter what, I was to make sure that you were on this ship.<eos> "I sent a message to the captain of the Scarborough.<eos> I told him where he would find you."
Yes, I know.<eos> Fuck me.<eos> Listen here!<eos> When we crest the point ahead and spot the Urca in anchor, we'll begin our final run at her.<eos> - Take it.<eos> - The Spanish banner may earn us a few hundred yards of confusion before the captain identifies us and opens fire.<eos> So we'll close fast on her, hammer her well with our guns, and then take the fight to her decks.<eos> That fight will be the fight of our lives, make no mistake.<eos> But on the other side lies paradise.<eos> I'll see you there.
Can you rid yourself?<eos> Knock once for yes, twice for no .<eos> Ok...<eos> Akela to Grey Wolf, answer<eos> Grey Wolf, where are you<eos> Grauer Wolf, answer...<eos> your position...<eos> Gray Wolf at Akela, please come...<eos> Here Gray Wolf hear me, Akela?<eos> For the guys out there in the Kapisa valley, this song is for you... And soon you're back home
There's cops.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Banshee County Sheriff's Department.<eos> We can see who you are, man.<eos> - Look, we just want to ask you a few questions.<eos> - Go fuck yourself, bitch.<eos> One of our girls was killed on Amish land and you're landing on us?<eos> - Typical racist white man bullshit.<eos> - Yeah, I get that a lot.<eos> Look, nobody's accusing you guys of anything.
No, what I'm thinking is I'm gonna take this bat and shove it up your bitch ass and see how you like that.<eos> - Show him.<eos> - I see.<eos> - Oh! - Fuck!<eos> - He's going nuts.<eos> - Hold up, hold up.<eos> - Crazy. Do you know what's worse than getting your testicles crushed with a baseball bat?<eos> Getting them crushed again.<eos> Go home.<eos> We're coming back for you, Dutchy.
If this gets me hanged, I'm going to take it very personally.<eos> This is your doing!<eos> Why would I seek the Duke's death?<eos> I want your word this is not another of your deadly games!<eos> I know how your mind works, your endless tricks and deceptions.<eos> Oh, yes, yes, yes.<eos> I am the grand deceiver, and you are the bluff, honest man of action.<eos> I'm familiar with the roles we play, Captain.<eos> I assure you I am not playing.<eos> Need I remind you that we are tied together by decisions we both took in Savoy five years ago?
Well, I was hoping that you might change your mind.<eos> Well, we do need the money.<eos> And I swear I'll never lie to you again.<eos> I hope not, cos next time, you'd be out on your ear.<eos> And... ..I'd miss you.<eos> A bodyguard of Musketeers.<eos> It's like being protected by wolves.<eos> Have you captured the man who tried to kill me?<eos> We shouldn't allow ourselves to be distracted by minor issues.<eos> My life...might be a minor issue to you, Cardinal, but not to me.
You incompetent fool.<eos> Nice look.<eos> Better with the hat.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Treason has to be paid for, Captain.<eos> I always thought you'd be back one day.<eos> Was it money?<eos> Were you paid by the Duke?<eos> If you think that, you know nothing about me.<eos> I'm going to blow you to hell.
Okay.<eos> Now, we should put our headlamps on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Okay?<eos> Can you check if mine is on?<eos> Where's yours?<eos> I'm not coming with you guys.<eos> I told you a bunch of times.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm leaving you guys in a second.
I remember stroking the cat, it was so soft.<eos> The cat?<eos> What cat, honey?<eos> A Siamese with blue eyes and a broken tail.<eos> Sweetie, you can't possibly remember that.<eos> You were barely a year old.<eos> I remember the taste of your milk in my mouth.<eos> The room, the liquid...<eos> Sweetie, what are you talking about?<eos> I just wanna tell you that I love you, Mom and Dad.
- We're on a trip.<eos> Alright, Jonathan?<eos> You're on a trip?<eos> - Where to?<eos> - The zoo, I think.<eos> No, you're going to take a plunge... in the piranha pond!<eos> Don't be scared. Those are old piranhas.<eos> They've lost their teeth.<eos> They don't bite anymore.<eos> However, what they can do... is tickle you to death!
Your Majesty, my apologies.<eos> I hope that, apart from this, you've enjoyed your trip.<eos> Shoot them!<eos> Don't let them escape!<eos> Weapons down!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Look at me, look at me.<eos> It's over.<eos> I've got you.
That makes him unique.<eos> I can do something with a man like that.<eos> Why should he still trust you?<eos> Because he's already half in love with me.<eos> You left him with a bloody dagger in his hand, facing the noose.<eos> What kind of idiot would overlook that?<eos> "Forgive me, d'Artagnan.<eos> "The man was a beast, I stabbed him in self-defence<eos> "and then I panicked.<eos> I never meant you to take the blame.
Oh, you've upset me now. I...<eos> Monsieur Aramis! Bravest of all the King's Musketeers.<eos> Only amongst the bravest, Your Majesty.<eos> Perhaps your friend would grant us a moment's privacy?<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> Oh, not at all.<eos> Well, perhaps it is a... a little sore.<eos> Poor, gallant Aramis.<eos> Accept this gift, as a token of your Queen's gratitude.<eos> May it keep you safe always.
You've done enough.<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> Pick him up now and the King and Queen are still in danger.<eos> What do you suggest?<eos> I go back in.<eos> They told me about the duel and your imprisonment, that it was all faked.<eos> Rather well, you have to admit.<eos> What for this time?<eos> Letting me think the worst.<eos> First I thought you were a condemned man, then a fugitive and now...this!
I had no choice.<eos> D'Artagnan was doing his duty at great personal risk. He deserves praise, not blame.<eos> Oh, he is very brave, I'm sure.<eos> Please accept our profound apologies for any misunderstanding.<eos> No hard feelings?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I always knew there'd be a good explanation.<eos> I beg Madame Bonacieux's forgiveness.<eos> I trust nothing of the kind will ever happen again.<eos> I'll see you to the door.
Thanks again for your hospitality.<eos> And you, too, little Pesche, you would-be drug baron!<eos> Go on: Squeeze a bit harder and I'll die of fear.<eos> Can't you just shut up, you fucking idiot!<eos> What with you throttling me I have to keep my mouth open.<eos> Look who it is!<eos> The gang's all here.<eos> You fuckers<eos> You not only didn't go to jail. You even made a big pile of dough.<eos> For you, a house by the sea, and for me, pocket money and a year behind bars.
- Let me talk to him.<eos> - Can you talk to me for one second first?<eos> Please?<eos> Come.<eos> Percy and I are going to Miami to see my father.<eos> So why don't you come with us?<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah, come with us.<eos> You want me to go...<eos> I can't come with you to Miami. I don't...
You know your son's a cook now?<eos> - I'm a line cook.<eos> - He's a line cook.<eos> Be careful!<eos> I'll have him home in time for school.<eos> - And you?<eos> Are you OK?<eos> - I'm amazing!<eos> "Oh, you're so sexy in that bandana. I want your big platanos."<eos> Looks here like you guys are having so much fun.
Oh, mama, Bobby was gonna explode no matter how I brought up expanding this place.<eos> Don't underestimate your Uncle.<eos> He's a steel hand in a velvet glove.<eos> Bobby bettered J.R. more often than he should have because J.R. underestimated him.<eos> You're better than your father was.<eos> I just don't want you to make the mistake.<eos> Daddy may have lost more than his share. But then, again... Daddy didn't have you as an ally.<eos> It's just so... big. You think it's too much?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I want you to know how glad I am that you're letting me plan a proper wedding for you and John Ross.
Okay, so here's the deal.<eos> It's...<eos> Hey, Terry.<eos> You want a cupcake?<eos> There's some in the kitchen.<eos> Fuck you and your fucking cupcakes, Hugh.<eos> Get a fucking life.<eos> Okay, cool.<eos> I'm gonna go work on some story ideas.<eos> I'll see you in the room, kids.
Yes.<eos> And you claim to have no idea how that happened?<eos> Porthos du Vallon is a man of fine reputation, a good soldier and a Musketeer of many years' standing.<eos> Du Vallon? Another of these fellows who adopts a noble name so he can play the gentleman?<eos> I know many born gentlemen who could not hold a candle to Porthos.<eos> Let me tell you something that life has taught me, Captain!<eos> You can dress your dog in a fine suit... Oh.....but once a mongrel, always a mongrel.<eos> A man lies dead, murdered!<eos> An example must be made!<eos> Porthos du Vallon... ..I find you guilty and sentence you to death.
The killer was no more than a foot away when the shot was fired.<eos> This was no accident.<eos> It was murder.<eos> Flea!<eos> Is that you?<eos> All these years, never one letter.<eos> How d'you know I learned to write? Hmm?<eos> You two are together now.<eos> Ah, it makes sense.<eos> I'm happy for you.
You were in a conspiracy with Jean de Mauvoisin.<eos> Conspiracy?<eos> I have a large congregation.<eos> This printing press is the only way I can stay in touch with them.<eos> Do you use gunpowder instead of ink?<eos> As God is my witness, this has nothing to do with me or my church.<eos> I preach reconciliation, not hatred.<eos> Someone intended to blow up your church, probably during a service.<eos> Catholics?<eos> Is it possible Jean was lying to you about his beliefs, that he infiltrated your church in order to destroy it?
The paper value is immense, if there was a way to make them pay.<eos> A business mind like yours is wasted in the Musketeers, Captain Treville.<eos> You're right.<eos> If the Court wasn't there, that land would be worth a king's ransom.<eos> Who knows when it might prove a wise investment?<eos> And, by the way, this search is illegal.<eos> I suggest you leave before I inform the Cardinal.<eos> Did you forge this in your son's name?<eos> It's a simple matter to compare the two signatures.<eos> I'll ask you again.
That's why I left.<eos> I'm a Musketeer.<eos> Porthos!<eos> Look out!<eos> I told you, Porthos.<eos> I told you I was get... ..getting out.<eos> My full confession, completely exonerating your Musketeer.<eos> I have a brother who will inherit my place as head of the family.<eos> Perhaps he will do a better job than me... of restoring this once-noble house.<eos> Emile de Mauvoisin, it is my duty to arrest you.
Ask.<eos> What exactly is happening with The Bridge?<eos> So, perhaps you're gonna tell me what you're doing here.<eos> You went into my room, I thought I'd go into yours.<eos> -Next stop, the Credit Bank of Panama.<eos> -I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Don't you?<eos> If your things are no longer in that safe, the only place they can be is the bank, unless you got that little boy to bury them in the sand.<eos> -What little boy is that?<eos> -Didn't I see you the other day?
But where did you take them, Mirabelle?<eos> What was your proximity to them?<eos> It is so easy to find.<eos> Always such a nice bit of color against the dark nights. Dark nights, dark nights. Dark nights, dark nights.<eos> We could have a picnic.<eos> A picnic.<eos> A picnic.<eos> Have a picnic.<eos> In a... In a... In a...<eos> We're coming to get you.
But they're just gonna see a man who snapped.<eos> Who went on a revenge spree.<eos> Killing and mutilating with no regard to the law or conscience.<eos> A man who's labeled by his country a... a criminal.<eos> A terrorist.<eos> So, I think talking to me is your best option.<eos> Tell me why you're in London. And I will do everything in my power to stop Special Activities from getting their hands on you.<eos> Come on, Mr. Bauer.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Jack Bauer's being transfered down to you, here's his file.
The blood work from the guy who stuck you came back.<eos> I'm sorry to say, but they're positive for HIV.<eos> Now, that doesn't mean you'll contract the virus, but if you haven't started the meds, I want you to start that cocktail immediately.<eos> All right, thank you so much.<eos> Well?<eos> Clean.<eos> Knew it.<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> Yeah.<eos> By the power vested in me, the Internet, and the state of California, I pronounce you husband and husband.
If you're gonna kill someone, it's probably best not to announce it.<eos> You're not really a member of the guard, are you?<eos> No. The real guard will be here soon unless we stop it.<eos> You don't actually think they're gonna forgive your crimes.<eos> Even if they do, then what?<eos> Guys like us, we're gonna become model citizens now, get jobs, if we're lucky, - maybe pick up their trash?<eos> - You got a point?<eos> No.<eos> I got a question.<eos> They locked you up, dumped you down here like lab rats to die.
- Try not to get eaten.<eos> No.<eos> Wait. If we distract it, it might let her go.<eos> Help me.<eos> No!<eos> It worked.<eos> It let her go. Can you get to the shore now?<eos> I got you.<eos> It's coming back.<eos> It's headed right for you, guys.
Hurry up, Emile!<eos> I'd sit up here if I were you. I'm sure your friend won't mind.<eos> Everything shipshape with the wife?<eos> Two envoys from the Spanish court have arrived in Le Havre in pursuit of the explorer Bonnaire.<eos> I know. He's under protective custody and on his way to Paris.<eos> To be escorted by the musketeer Athos and his friends?<eos> You are well informed, as always.<eos> Will you be requiring my services in the near future?<eos> I have some personal matters to attend to.<eos> Any notion of a personal life ended the day I picked you out of the gutter and made you my creature.
A calabash.<eos> Grows all over West Africa.<eos> I'm guessing your ancestry owes something to those regions.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Did they come to France as slaves?<eos> My mother.<eos> I've known many freed slaves who prospered.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, she didn't. I was fending for myself since the age of five.<eos> Still, you...
Inform your husband Milady de Winter called.<eos> And tell d'Artagnan too, if you wish.<eos> So pretty.<eos> Our Spanish friend.<eos> Leave him to me.<eos> D'Artagnan, say nothing to the others of what happened.<eos> You have my word.<eos> There was a woman here while you were away.<eos> She said her name was Milady de Winter.<eos> She seemed to know you...quite well.
She's offering my husband work.<eos> That's good.<eos> My husband wouldn't approve of you receiving women alone in the house.<eos> In case you intended to.<eos> She frightened me, d'Artagnan.<eos> I suggest you put that down so we can talk.<eos> It appears you had quite an adventure on your way here.<eos> Some adventures a man can live without.<eos> I'm curious.<eos> How would you define a good adventure?
He's scum.<eos> He's a slaver.<eos> He's under our protection.<eos> Protection be damned!<eos> We have our orders.<eos> We obey them.<eos> I'll kill you too, you get in my way.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Gentlemen! Come on!<eos> Bonnaire, there's a ship waiting for you in the harbour.

Well, who are you talking to then?<eos> Nobody. I'm just practicing my speech - for my birthday.<eos> - KING: Right.

Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Has something happened to Naveed?<eos> Please. I can explain later.<eos> But you need to leave now before it's too late.<eos> Too late?<eos> Too late for what?<eos> Wait. What are you doing?<eos> Calling the police.<eos> No. Please. I'm trying to protect you.
Previously on 24...<eos> I've hidden evidence in our room under the floorboards.<eos> When the authorities arrive, I will claim that you've been opposed to this attack from the start and that you've been held here against your will.<eos> Aunt Simone!<eos> Grab your daughter and leave London... right now.<eos> - Wait, what are you doing? - Calling the police.<eos> - Please, I'm trying to protect you.
I'm out.<eos> I'm out, too.<eos> Jack, backup is here.<eos> Federal agents.<eos> - Drop your weapons.<eos> - Freeze.<eos> Identify yourself.<eos> Agent Morgan.<eos> Keep your hands free.<eos> I'm glad to see you.
That's a bummer because the thing is... I'm supposed to stop you.<eos> Yeah, it's a bummer.<eos> Are you armed?<eos> - We have blunt objects.<eos> - To hit you with.<eos> We got that.<eos> If I don't stop you, I lose my job.<eos> If you stop us, you'll lose your teeth.<eos> Then again, we're in briefs...<eos> We'll leave you to it.
She's bound to desire me at some point.<eos> Sorry, The Other, but you're not facing reality.<eos> I don't want anything. I'm just living in my corner.<eos> You're asking society for something.<eos> You want those of us who work to sponsor your vacation.<eos> That's not fair.<eos> People like you are society's cancer.<eos> - Don't exaggerate.<eos> - Just stating the truth.<eos> What's it like for you when it's sunny?
What?<eos> Yo, how the fuck do they even know about Emily, huh? - I don't know.<eos> - Do they even fucking know about her?<eos> - I may have said something about you guys.<eos> - What the fuck did you say?<eos> When I was in the joint, I may have talked about you and Emily.<eos> - Why the fuck are you talking about us?<eos> - I was so happy for you.<eos> Man, there's no love in there.<eos> I was happy for you guys. I'm sorry.
- Come up with something.<eos> - I know, all right?<eos> They're wolves in there, Jimmy.<eos> They're wolves in there.<eos> I can't go back.<eos> All right.<eos> You just got to do what I say, okay?<eos> Gotta do what I say.<eos> Fuck!<eos> ...invested in me, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
That's Zach, my comedy coach.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Think funny.<eos> Hi, Zach.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Zach this is my nephew, Ned.<eos> Ned, Zach.<eos> Think funny.<eos> Hey, you know, you guys have work to do, and I have to go get a room.<eos> I'll leave you to it for now.
God brought him back to us.<eos> Yeah, you go and see what I did to Jonah Lambrecht.<eos> You'll see that God had nothing to do with it.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Here's the paperwork on him.<eos> It's two hours to Jefferson County.<eos> Sheriff's Department will meet you at the county line.
- Yeah, I witnessed it.<eos> I was defenseless.<eos> Is she okay?<eos> She was in surgery. We've been looking for these assholes all night.<eos> - I sure hope she's okay.<eos> - Shut the fuck up!<eos> Shut it!<eos> We were gonna head to the hospital after this.<eos> It's gonna have to wait.<eos> I need you both after you're done booking them.
I don't know.<eos> I just can't keep doing the things I've been doing to people.<eos> No more.<eos> No more.<eos> When I got out and I found you, you had a home, a family.<eos> You had all the things you were supposed to have with me.<eos> And that fucking killed me.<eos> Then I saw Deva.<eos> And the truth is I just didn't want to go.<eos> So I told myself that by staying, I was protecting you.
Stand back, ma'am!<eos> --Let me go! It's my husband!<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> "And then there's people who change their mind like changing a shirt."<eos> Jeannot! How you're doing?<eos> "It's exhausting, the adventure.<eos> If only we were willing to take a car..."<eos> "There! Here's one!"<eos> "No, it's a truck.<eos> Get in the back, boys, I'll take you."
Here we go.<eos> Texting behind your back?<eos> Jesus.<eos> - You "Hendrix texting"?<eos> - Just staying ahead.<eos> - That's what a good campaign manager does.<eos> - No. No, a good campaign manager, Amy...<eos> Excuse me, I'm about to be brilliant.<eos> Ah! You guys are just like two little pretty Easter eggs.<eos> I'd love to crack you open.
Then, you'll learn to accept the freak for who he is.<eos> Hey, freak show. Nice catch.<eos> Creepy and special.<eos> Moments of levity should be found amongst the rigors of training.<eos> It was human piss.<eos> And slowly but surely, I'll begin to lighten up, and you'll see that this rough-around-the-edges persona is merely skin-deep.<eos> It didn't hurt.<eos> Everybody laugh.<eos> 'Cause I'm paralyzed.<eos> And as the music escalates, you begin to improve dramatically.
That's still pretty cool.<eos> Even when you know it's coming, it's still pretty cool.<eos> Am I right?<eos> You might be right.<eos> Hey!<eos> Have you come to eat my brains?<eos> What the hell?<eos> I thought you said there were no homeless people.<eos> I did not think there was anyone here, I swear.<eos> Who sent you?
Should I read it aloud, Ace?<eos> Oh, I think you should, Dick.<eos> I think that's a good idea.<eos> It reads, "Dear Mr. Grant Rosenfalis..."<eos> That's you.<eos> "We regret to inform you "that due to your refusal to pay tuition, "you are no longer a registered student at this university."<eos> You know what that means?<eos> Yeah, it means I owe Caleb 10 bucks, because we made a bet that you were illiterate.<eos> Oh, I'm literate, and I can read, and I'm a student, unlike Grant, and since he's on your official roster as a team member, you're boned.<eos> I boned you.
Hank, you are the single most intense player I've ever seen.<eos> That's very kind of you to say.<eos> Rufio!<eos> In all honesty, you terrify me, so you're cool.<eos> Jimmy, you are a beast on the field, and you have the voice of Gabriel.<eos> Donnie, your body is a wonderland, and I hate you for it.<eos> George, you have had quite a rough go of it, to say the least, and your commitment to this team, while misplaced priority-wise, inspires me to get out of bed in the morning.<eos> I don't know your name, and I never will.<eos> Your dad, your grandmother, your future employer, they may think this is stupid, that it doesn't mean anything, but 30 years from now, these are the moments that we will look back on.<eos> If we lose, I never want to see any of you ever again.
And I...<eos> I've done everything that you've asked of me.<eos> It's been two years since you started investigating my company.<eos> And since then, I've spent thousands of dollars hiring lawyers... to provide you with every piece of information that your office has requested.<eos> And I expect that you've been asking the same of my competitors.<eos> So with all this information that you've gained... we're just asking... do you have any idea who's been doing this to us?<eos> I don't.<eos> As you know, we've been investigating industry-wide corruption in your business... that seems to have been going on for years.<eos> So you're right.<eos> That means you're all stealing from each other... which as far as I can tell is just a refreshing new take... on what you've been doing to your customers and fellow taxpayers... for the last 15 years.
Alarm's gonna be in on... Wednesday.<eos> I chased him away.<eos> He's not coming back.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, you do this and only this.<eos> You look down at the cloth.<eos> You don't say a word.<eos> You just stare down at the cloth... and very slowly just start shaking your head.<eos> Then after sitting in silence way longer than feels comfortable... you turn... and you say...
Why?<eos> Because we're never gonna be the cheapest option.<eos> So we have to be the best.<eos> And they want...<eos> No.<eos> They need to feel that you want the best too.<eos> That's why our trucks are the newest or the cleanest.<eos> And our drivers are approachable.<eos> Now, after you've done the math... and you've shown them how much they can save over the long haul... through proper maintenance... you need to get them to sign.<eos> But the problem is, by hiring you... they need to fire someone else.
Stare longer than you should.<eos> This is not a joke.<eos> You will only keep this job if you close, and that's not funny to you.<eos> I'm only interested in this company growing... and when it isn't, it's not very funny to me at all.<eos> These people work very hard for their money.<eos> And these other guys are ripping them off... treating them poorly because they don't know.<eos> So when you look them in the eye... you have to believe that we are better.<eos> And we are.<eos> But you will never do anything as hard as staring someone straight in the eye... and telling the truth.<eos> Well, it was great to meet you.
I'm running.<eos> You better run, cuz.<eos> - Back in your car.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - Get back! - Stay in the car.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Oh, there he is.<eos> Got to be the hero?<eos> Oh, fuck you.
Oh, fuck you.<eos> Couldn't just let us take the fucking truck.<eos> Did they see you come in here?<eos> Man, I don't think so.<eos> - Did they or not? Yes or no.<eos> - No!<eos> Look, there's a door down here about four more flights.<eos> You come out under the bridge.<eos> It's a park.<eos> - Fuck you!
Stop.<eos> Abel, we had a chance to meet for a little bit before you got here.<eos> And, of course, everyone in this room... is fully capable of lying to their own mothers on their deathbeds.<eos> But the conclusion that we've come to... and I should say that we feel fairly certain... after a very frank conversation... that the guys who are doing this... that they're not actually working for anyone in this room.<eos> As you know, there are plenty of other smaller providers in the area... that might have something to do with it who are not here tonight, so...<eos> Peter, thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That may be true.<eos> But over the last six months... 110,000 gallons of fuel have been stolen from me and my family.<eos> Now, the reason we asked Bill to get you all here... is because the people at this table... are the only people within 200 miles of here... that have the ability to purchase and store that kind of quantity.
You know something? I never realized that we had this view from back here.<eos> I did.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Abel!<eos> I thought you said you threw that in the river.<eos> Well, I didn't.<eos> Yeah, I can see that.<eos> I have nowhere to go.<eos> Nowhere easy.<eos> Fuck you.
I did.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Abel!<eos> I thought you said you threw that in the river.<eos> Well, I didn't.<eos> Yeah, I can see that.<eos> I have nowhere to go.<eos> Nowhere easy.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Fuck you.
Must have taken great strength.<eos> Go on.<eos> Take these men.<eos> Make me rich.<eos> You don't know me, but you once did... when I was the lowest among you.<eos> Now I've returned.<eos> And I offer you a chance to be free of this place.<eos> I'm Charles Vane.<eos> And you were a strong crew once, proper pirates.<eos> Feared, as you should have been, before he dragged you away from the sea, before he convinced you to live here like animals.
Stand back.<eos> Please let me through!<eos> Aaah!<eos> Thieves! Thieves!<eos> Thieves!<eos> Make way!<eos> God bless you, Your Majesty!
A month or so.<eos> There is one thing that might help.<eos> Comtesse de Larroque had taken an interest in her.<eos> She was teaching her to read and write.<eos> Many enlightened nobles show kindness to their servants.<eos> No, this was more than that.<eos> Therese knew Greek and Latin and...and even studied the stars.<eos> Fleur attended some of her lessons, too.<eos> They...went in secret.<eos> Luca. I'm delighted to see you.
It can never be that these women choose to leave of their own free will.<eos> It must always be that Ninon de Larroque has corrupted them.<eos> Therese and Fleur were far below you in status.<eos> They were not in a position to make a decision of their own free will.<eos> I view all women as equals, no matter what the circumstances of their birth.<eos> You have the money and position to indulge such whims.<eos> Look outside your window and tell me everyone is equal.<eos> You accuse me of hypocrisy?<eos> Thank you for your help.<eos> Will I see you again?
I will consider my options.<eos> Perhaps you can pray to St Anthony for guidance.<eos> I'm sure his face was a picture when you kissed him.<eos> Why shouldn't I make the first approach to a man I desire?<eos> Oh, I could never be so bold.<eos> You'd be amazed at what can happen when a woman takes the initiative.<eos> I'm sure I would.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I know this man.<eos> He will seek to trap you and still your voice.
But I believe marriage to be a curse.<eos> I will not submit to it.<eos> As it happens, I agree.<eos> But why?<eos> I am a wealthy woman.<eos> But on my wedding day, everything that I own becomes the property of my husband, including my body.<eos> I will not be owned by anyone.<eos> So, what they say is true?<eos> You are a rebellious woman?<eos> Does that frighten you? No.
You're being too hard on her.<eos> She was protecting the girl, not deceiving you.<eos> For what it's worth, Madam, this trial is a mockery of religion.<eos> The God I believe in stands for love, not cruelty.<eos> You are a contradiction, Monsieur Aramis.<eos> The soldier who preaches love, and a famous libertine who cherishes women.<eos> We all search for truth in different ways.<eos> If you have faith in your heart... ..take this.<eos> Please, take it.<eos> My God will not abandon you.
You stay out of it.<eos> I trusted you to look after her.<eos> You knew she was meeting that woman, and you lied to cover for her.<eos> She only wanted an education.<eos> What does she need education for?<eos> She'll be a seamstress until she's married, and then she'll be a dutiful wife and mother.<eos> That's all.<eos> Constance! Help me, please!<eos> Out of my way!<eos> If you hurt her... I'll know.
She is a convicted criminal and deceiver!<eos> Why does this man accuse me?<eos> Is he a friend of Ninon's? Restrain him immediately!<eos> She is not to be trusted!<eos> Athos! Calm!<eos> The court has heard enough from this witness.<eos> You are excused.<eos> Who was that?<eos> Comtesse Ninon de Larroque, it has been proven in the sight of God that you are a practising witch who has consorted with the Devil.<eos> The court finds you guilty on all counts. But... this is madness.
All will be well, I'm sure.<eos> The Cardinal's made of granite.<eos> Cardinal, please don't die! Please don't die!<eos> The emetic, at once!<eos> Whoever did this, I want them found.<eos> The Cardinal.<eos> Will he live?<eos> He has been no friend to the musketeers.<eos> We are all servants of France, Your Majesty.<eos> I did not expect to find my gift to you around the Comtesse's neck.
He has been no friend to the musketeers.<eos> We are all servants of France, Your Majesty.<eos> I did not expect to find my gift to you around the Comtesse's neck.<eos> Is Ninon your lover?<eos> She is beautiful.<eos> She is a good woman facing a hideous death.<eos> I...<eos> I only wanted to comfort her.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Your compassion does you credit.
You know I'm to be married?<eos> He's a 40-year-old widower with a butcher's stall in Montmartre.<eos> I'm told he's a very good catch.<eos> Was it you?<eos> That's your first question?<eos> I'm touched. Am I dying?<eos> Half the doctors say you're doomed.<eos> The other half claim you will make a full recovery.<eos> There's a lot of professional pride at stake.<eos> I'm glad you find this amusing.

What's this?<eos> The death sentence was commuted.<eos> The Comtesse confessed.<eos> Where's Father Sastini?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's over there!<eos> To the Cardinal's room.<eos> Sastini!<eos> You're late!<eos> We're glad to find you well, Your Eminence.
I'll pray for her every night.<eos> I'm happy for you.<eos> Well, I must get on.<eos> It was you who went to Baudin, wasn't it?<eos> You pleaded for Fleur. Don't be silly.<eos> You are the finest woman I have ever met.<eos> I don't believe there's a more generous soul in all of France.<eos> Stop that.<eos> You're embarrassing me.<eos> What if I want to embarrass you?

Fine.<eos> There you are!<eos> Don't do that again.<eos> Come on, let's go ok?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What are you doing on my property?<eos> We weren't trying to steal anything, I promise!<eos> You're trespassing!<eos> No, no, no, my dog just ran back here and we came back to get him!<eos> Who sent you?

Oh, you guys are so young, you have no idea what's going on out there.<eos> Why should you?<eos> When I was your age, I thought the world was... a good and fair place.<eos> I've seen some shit since then.<eos> People nowadays live in their naive, comfortable bubble worlds, and the men behind the curtain want to keep them that way.<eos> The last thing they want is an informed, public cable free-thought.<eos> Free.<eos> Yeah.<eos> People out there, they think they're free, but they couldn't be further from the truth.<eos> That's why you gotta stay off the radar.
We don't have time for this conspiracy theory bullshit!<eos> We need to get help! Now!<eos> Seth!<eos> Let him talk.<eos> What kind of treaty?<eos> Well... The powers that be turn a blind eye to them abducting civilians and doing whatever the hell it is they do with them.<eos> And, in turn, we get to run around down here as if we own the place.<eos> It's a basic simple agreement with one cardinal rule:<eos> Do not engage.<eos> And you... you engaged.
Sit down.<eos> Do not move.<eos> You can go now.<eos> Go.<eos> - Go...<eos> Go<eos> You buy us.<eos> You own us.<eos> But it's not what you think.<eos> Actually, we own you.
Do not move.<eos> You can go now.<eos> Go.<eos> - Go...<eos> Go<eos> You buy us.<eos> You own us.<eos> But it's not what you think.<eos> Actually, we own you.<eos> It is you we are watching.
Why?<eos> Is it because they are dangerous?<eos> - Robots are always safe.<eos> - But not at nuclear power plants?<eos> They will say that Hubots within the government and care industry are virus protected.<eos> - Not the one who drove a bus into the ditch.<eos> - It was owned by a private company. Who cares, what's the difference...<eos> Now the debate has started!<eos> We will drive as many wedges as possible.<eos> Divide up into two of you and we'll see who comes out on top.
Bea..<eos> You said I can't stop you from doing it.<eos> Now I'm doing it.<eos> You think I just wanted to sleep with you.<eos> But that's not all.<eos> I...<eos> I love you.<eos> I do not think of you as a Hubot.<eos> Like the others...<eos> My son...he's not even my son, but he hates you. He and others like him hate all like you.
Voices carry over water.<eos> I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.<eos> First you'll want your pay.<eos> - 10,000 was it?<eos> - 10,000.<eos> Wait!<eos> Shh.<eos> You don't want the queen to hear, do you?<eos> 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you.<eos> And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?

I know.<eos> But you must admit it looks suspicious.<eos> The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder.
- Why do you care?<eos> Might book passage across the Narrow Sea.<eos> Fight as a sellsword.<eos> Second Sons, could be.<eos> Seems like a good fit for me.<eos> I'd like to see Braavos one day.<eos> Why Braavos?<eos> I have friends there.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> Seven blessings to you.
But we were safe.<eos> Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver.<eos> I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better.<eos> The whole country's gone sour.<eos> You got any ale?<eos> Afraid not.<eos> How can a man not keep ale in his home?<eos> You look like you could really swing that sword.<eos> A real warrior with proper training.<eos> Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you.

- House Musgood.<eos> - And House Haigh.<eos> - House Haigh.<eos> They don't have enough men between them to raid a pantry.<eos> Westeros is not the world, Your Grace.<eos> We need to look east for ships and men.<eos> 10,000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company.<eos> - The Golden Company? - They've never broken a contract.<eos> They're sellswords.<eos> We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight?
Why haven't you thrown me in a dungeon?<eos> You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived.<eos> What did you discuss?<eos> You think we conspired together?<eos> What did you discuss?<eos> The death of my sister.<eos> For which you blame me.<eos> She was raped and murdered by the Mountain.<eos> The Mountain follows your orders.<eos> Of course I blame you.
Of course. Fetch Bronn.<eos> I have a job for him.<eos> I've already asked, my lord.<eos> - They won't let him see you.<eos> - Why not? They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate.<eos> He's under investigation himself.<eos> And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?<eos> I'll ask, my lord.<eos> There's something else, my lord.<eos> A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you.
He claims you are no woman at all, but a man who... hides his cock in his own asshole.<eos> Ignore him, Your Grace. These are meaningless words.<eos> They're not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them.<eos> I have something to say to the people of Meereen.<eos> First, I will need this one to be quiet.<eos> Do I have a champion?<eos> Your Grace, I've won more single combats than any man alive.<eos> Which is why you must remain by my side.<eos> I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi.<eos> Let me stand for you today as well.
Which is why you must remain by my side.<eos> I've been by your side longer than any of them, Khaleesi.<eos> Let me stand for you today as well.<eos> You are my most trusted advisor, my most valued general, and my dearest friend.<eos> I will not gamble with your life.<eos> I was the last to join your army.<eos> I'm not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied.<eos> My mother was a whore.<eos> I come from nothing. And before long, I will return to nothing.<eos> Let me kill this man for you.
Do you think he did it?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, he hated the little twat, sure.<eos> But who didn't?<eos> And poison's not his style.<eos> Or murder, for that matter.<eos> You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?<eos> You haven't been to see him yet, eh?<eos> We're done for today.<eos> Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?
Or murder, for that matter.<eos> You want to know for sure, why don't you ask him?<eos> You haven't been to see him yet, eh?<eos> We're done for today.<eos> Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service?<eos> You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie.<eos> Aye.<eos> But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day.<eos> You were his first choice.<eos> He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him.
I don't think I am.<eos> That's a relief.<eos> Because you know what happens when we marry?<eos> We say our vows in front of the high septon.<eos> And after the ceremony, there's a feast.<eos> When we marry, I become yours.<eos> Forever.<eos> It's getting late.<eos> I should go.<eos> May I come and visit you again?
Valyrian steel.<eos> Mmm.<eos> It's yours.<eos> I can't accept this.<eos> It was reforged from Ned Stark's sword.<eos> You'll use it to defend Ned Stark's daughter.<eos> You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother.<eos> Lady Stark's dead.<eos> Arya's probably dead, too, but there's still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe.<eos> I've got something else for you.
I almost forgot.<eos> I have one more gift.<eos> I don't need a squire.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> He'll slow me down.<eos> My brother owes him a debt.<eos> He's not safe here.<eos> You're keeping him from harm.<eos> It's chivalry.<eos> I won't slow you down, ser-- my lady.
But if that's not enough, then consider this.<eos> If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father.<eos> He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men.<eos> Stabbed in the back by cowards.<eos> He deserved far better.<eos> All we can give him now is justice.<eos> Who will join me?<eos> I can't let a recruit come north of the Wall.<eos> Then let me say my vows.<eos> If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how.
Those captured were executed for breaking the law, while others fled to the woods and lived as bandits.<eos> Act 1: Chusul Clan of Mt. Jiri<eos> This is Lord Jo Won-suk's son Jo Su-in.<eos> My father's had a stroke and could not attend, pardon me for coming in his place.<eos> Hope he recovers soon.<eos> It's ivory.<eos> My father's small gesture...<eos> He sincerely congratulates you on your 60th.<eos> Tell him his gift is happily accepted.<eos> I brought this from China especially for you, it's called a telescope.
Dolmuchi, a moment?<eos> So hot...<eos> Making a living in this world ain't so easy.<eos> Anyway...<eos> There's... something that's bothering me.<eos> Interested in a big score?<eos> Wait here.<eos> Master.<eos> Come in.<eos> Master, it's... an honor to meet you.
Yo, baldy.<eos> This isn't your bed.<eos> Wake up kid, all the elders are up.<eos> Bud, just chill.<eos> I'm a walking shitstorm.<eos> Holy shit...<eos> I apologize if I offend you, but even a mutt will laugh at your puny dick.<eos> I feel terrible.<eos> I dunno why you're taking the long way around.<eos> Why don't you two unload the litter?
He's one of them.<eos> After two years of investigation, we finally caught him.<eos> The morning is bright, meet on Spring Equinox day.<eos> After a lengthy interrogation, we found out that this letter for 'morning' actually signifies Lord Jo's residence.<eos> That is quite peculiar.<eos> We intercepted this message from a thief a few days ago.<eos> It is the same.<eos> Isn't today... the Spring Equinox?<eos> You fools!<eos> You think you decoded our...
Come to city hall!<eos> There's no time!<eos> Please hurry!<eos> Father, this'll feed us for months!<eos> There's only one reason why you're still breathing.<eos> Once we leave, give back all the lands Jo Yoon stole.<eos> If not, we'll break every bone in your body, and gut you alive.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Please let me live. I'll do everything you ask.<eos> What brings you here, Master Jo?
Give him a tit to suck on.<eos> I'm a little busy, bugger off.<eos> Dae-nam!<eos> Open your eyes!<eos> Find the bald bandit.<eos> You sons of bitches!<eos> Get inside.<eos> It hurts so much...<eos> I'll come right back.<eos> Don't come outside, you hear?
What?<eos> Love hurts like dengue.<eos> What is a dengle?<eos> Dengue fever.<eos> It's like malaria. But you don't die.<eos> No dengue in Germany?<eos> No.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> I appreciate you getting that abominable music off.<eos> But seriously, you should just give each other a hug.
Where you hiding, bitch?<eos> Don't you know that you gotta be polite to people in this society?<eos> 'Cause if not, this is what happens tonight!<eos> Diego, don't come back here.<eos> We have guns and we will shoot you.<eos> Cali?<eos> (Is) that you?<eos> I got a little bonus.<eos> Got a little package deal.<eos> But I'll tell you what, tonight I'm gonna release the beast, on the both of you fucking lame bitches!
The business district is always quiet on Purge Night.<eos> The banks move their money, so no one 's ever down here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Stop.<eos> We don't even know your names.<eos> I'm Liz, and this is Shane.<eos> Hi.<eos> Eva.<eos> My daughter, Cali.<eos> It's nice to officially meet you on this shitty night.
Get down, let's go.<eos> Take this.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey.<eos> Why did you stop at our building?<eos> Why did you help us?<eos> Didn't we establish a no-talking rule?<eos> People are getting killed all over the city.<eos> Why did you stop for us?<eos> I saw you.
We're here to help you!<eos> Take positions over there.<eos> We need a firing line. Let's go!<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> Nobody special.<eos> Just some people who don't necessarily agree with the Purge is all.<eos> You're with Carmelo Johns.<eos> Yes.<eos> Fuck the New Founding Fathers!<eos> Fuck you!
God be with you all.<eos> You want to tell us what we're doing here?<eos> Do you see that house on the corner?<eos> The owner of that house killed my son 12 months ago.<eos> Nicholas was coming home from school, and he swerved off the road.<eos> That bastard's blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit, but, you know, he got off on a technicality, so... him and his wife and his two little kids, well, they live in that house,<eos> Two weeks ago, I came here and I disabled his back barricade.<eos> That's what we're doing here.<eos> I want you both to stay in this car, do you understand me?<eos> I don't want you to move.
I won't object.<eos> - Chilly?<eos> - Yeah, it's very bracing.<eos> Come on. Ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> 17, 18...<eos> There we go. Right.<eos> I'm going to put the kettle on.<eos> Calls you one and calls you all
Yeah.<eos> Seems like you're not really into this. Oh, I am.<eos> You are.<eos> Hey, there they are.<eos> Who have you got? I got a queen. He's got a king.<eos> Sit down. Thought you guys left your own party, found something better.<eos> - Want some?<eos> - No, I'm good.<eos> I just...<eos> I wanted to say we support you guys.

Thought you guys left your own party, found something better.<eos> - Want some?<eos> - No, I'm good.<eos> I just...<eos> I wanted to say we support you guys.<eos> If you need anything, you just let me know.<eos> Support us how?<eos> I mean, you know, we support you, like, "Go America!" right?
- You like it? - Yeah!<eos> Now this is classic French dish, but with a little twist.<eos> It's Boeuf Bourguignon 5':<eos> Aisha, Mukhtar!<eos> Mukhtar. - Aisha, come on!<eos> - Aisha!<eos> Come! It's started!<eos> You don't want to miss it. Coming!<eos> God!<eos> A special surprise for you.
You knew I was dying... didn't you, Father?<eos> Did you name a mountain after me?<eos> Amunet, girl?<eos> No, much older.<eos> Father, Mina's waiting.<eos> No!<eos> I wonder...<eos> I wonder when was the moment you knew you wanted to fuck her?<eos> Why were you not more discrete?<eos> Vanessa heard you.
No, much older.<eos> Father, Mina's waiting.<eos> No!<eos> I wonder...<eos> I wonder when was the moment you knew you wanted to fuck her?<eos> Why were you not more discrete?<eos> Vanessa heard you.<eos> The two of you.<eos> She heard you fucking and she was curious.<eos> She walked closer, she rounded the corner and discovered you, the two of you, you know, fucking.
You have no role in this play.<eos> Don't move, Ethan.<eos> Mina, I can save you.<eos> Why do you think I want to be saved?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Somewhere inside, you know who you are.<eos> Who you were meant to be.<eos> I am who I was meant to be.<eos> You'll understand when you join the Master.<eos> When you all join him.
It has no cover on it, huh?<eos> That book... it used to have a cover.<eos> I remember I read this cover, you know, when it has a cover on it.<eos> It was saying that Harry Potter, it has seven book, you know?<eos> You guys only have six book.<eos> I don't know what to tell you... I...<eos> - You know how long I'm asking for this book?<eos> No, you don't. You're new.<eos> Two years.<eos> Imagine, two years I'm asking you guys to give me this last book.
I was trying to be nice with you.<eos> I-I-I wasn't being asshole to you.<eos> I don't know why you are being asshole to me.<eos> I am not being an asshole to you. I... I think you... yes, yes, yes, you are.<eos> Yes.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> You locked up us here for years!<eos> For what?<eos> To show the world that you are good guy and we are bad guy?<eos> Fuck you!
Don't you see we're alike?<eos> We're 2 amateurs pretending to believe.<eos> How old is she?<eos> She's 7.<eos> I might know of someone... You could deposit a cheque from them.<eos> Because you're right.<eos> We'll make it.<eos> We'll keep to our promises.<eos> - Mummy, saw my magic box?<eos> - Nan is waiting for you.
Guess who?<eos> I've missed you, coz.<eos> I didn't think you were gonna make it.<eos> I ran out of gas in Altoona.<eos> I got followed into a ladies' room at a truck stop outside of Youngstown.<eos> I had to give a serious ass-kicking. But I am here now. Oh, man!<eos> Joe used to bounce me on his knee when I was little, and he was old as the hills and twice as wrinkly, even then.<eos> How's your life?<eos> I show up every day.<eos> It's lonely with you guys gone, you know?
OK?<eos> All right, come.<eos> Here he is!<eos> Get a good look, you sick bastard?<eos> You don't remember me at all, do you?<eos> Our families shared a campsite in the UP when our dads got work cutting trees.<eos> Summer of '96.<eos> I used to watch you swimming in the creek.<eos> That's creepy.<eos> I was just looking out for the safety of all you kids.
- Come back and see us again, please. - Okay.<eos> Why do you keep saying that?<eos> "The price you paid."<eos> - What does that even?<eos> - Fuck if I know.<eos> A director I worked with used it once.<eos> I thought it sounded good, so I incorporated it into my patter.<eos> It's good to have patter.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - I have the network for you two.
I came to him.<eos> Since when does the CIA go after drug dealers?<eos> We don't.<eos> These guys are ex-commando of the Mexican army.<eos> The drugs give them the money and the influence to take down the Mexican government.<eos> So you got him out.<eos> But the cartel thinks that they flipped a dirty judge, and all the questions you've been asking put that in jeopardy.<eos> They have pictures of our daughter.<eos> And you, Annie.<eos> Now, if they find out who I'm working for... they'll kill both you and Emma.
Henry had his face shot off one minute he was there, then he just, wasn't<eos> Ed bled out for hours<eos> I want mom<eos> someone will come for us<eos> I can't shoot myself up<eos> you have to do it<eos> I love you<eos> I killed them they can't come home<eos> it's alright to leave me here<eos> I didn't lift a finger to stomp any of you

The of? ce is our temple.<eos> - It's in a word doc on the wall.<eos> Our rubber stamps are transcendental.<eos> - They belong to CAPITOL.<eos> We're not superman!<eos> - We're not wonderwoman!<eos> We do our job, no fuss.<eos> - You can always count on us.<eos> But we're more than just a cubicle.<eos> We're always there for you.
Marvin!<eos> - I'm not, not at all.<eos> I even did Tae Kwon Do.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> I could take on anyone in the room.<eos> You know, the most important thing you learn is how to evade. Then you don't even have to attack.<eos> Sure, you learn how to punch in Tae Kwon Do and also kicks<eos> Oh!<eos> Marvin?<eos> Dear colleagues, on behalf of the management, I'm privileged to... be able to welcome you to what promises to be a fantastic evening in Botzenburg.
Marvin?<eos> Dear colleagues, on behalf of the management, I'm privileged to... be able to welcome you to what promises to be a fantastic evening in Botzenburg.<eos> Over 50 years ago, the foundations for the first CAPITOL branch... in Germany were laid here.<eos> But we don't want to get nostalgic just yet. We don't want to start by looking back. Indeed, only a select few of us were there in person 50 years ago.<eos> The financial crisis has shown us... that we can't just keep going like before.<eos> We have to be more transparent and above all more honest.<eos> Trust is the way.<eos> To get this message across, we're launching a major ad campaign, and I'm glad to be able to share the new CAPITOL spot with you now.<eos> Enjoy!<eos> Insurance companies? I've got no idea what you're really like. Supposedly, you're there for me, but all I know about you is?
OK.<eos> Now we'll take a trip back into the history of Botzenburg.<eos> This isn't only the birthplace of CAPITOL, it's also the place where the famous composer Robert Schumann... tried to kill himself in 1844, which of course didn't work.<eos> Instead, he composed the String Quartet in A Major.<eos> Our colleague Mr. Turculu, who organized this evening, was able to get the Botzenburg String Orchestra, no, Ensemble, who will now give us a taste of this String, er, Quartet.<eos> For your pissing leisure.<eos> Listening pleasure!<eos> Yeah, that was "Joy in Osnabrück".<eos> Fabiana has put in a request for Justin Bieber's "Baby". I'll play that in a minute, but first here's a song of my own, for Jennifer, who's standing up front.<eos> Here we go for her and you: "Don't give up!"
Great!<eos> Let's get outta here!<eos> Adrien...<eos> Lea...<eos> Paul!<eos> 48 hours, and it's full-on hysteria!<eos> - Chill out.<eos> - I can't chill out!<eos> My life's crumbling around me!<eos> You're all staying and you'll apologize, got it?
Your grandfather's brother.<eos> You didn't know? We only just met.<eos> A long story. Sorry.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> - Can I change somewhere?<eos> - Of course.<eos> It's embarrassing, but I have no spare rooms.<eos> 30 years renovating.<eos> All our money goes on the olive groves.<eos> Lea will take you to Magali's. She does BB.
Don't laugh.<eos> You don't know what it means to him.<eos> We won the gold medal.<eos> You're the best.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We did it.<eos> They're the best.<eos> Twenty years.<eos> Twenty years! We won the gold medal.<eos> There you are, kids.
Sit down.<eos> Sweetie, where are you?<eos> We're sick with worry.<eos> With Tiago.<eos> I'm going away for a few days.<eos> What'll I tell your mother?<eos> I'll call her.<eos> Granny?<eos> He's the one. I'm sure.<eos> I can't do it without you all.
Can I bring my coffee?<eos> One and three quarters.<eos> - No good.<eos> - This is bullshit.<eos> I got grilled all day and all night and still... I brought back a bug for you.<eos> A prosecutor trapped that between a file and a coffee cup and I carried it back in my bra.<eos> You guys are full of shit.<eos> There's no roach business.<eos> I'm done.<eos> Fuck you.
Are you and Mom going to get a divorce?<eos> How can we get divorced?<eos> We're not even married.<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> - I do.<eos> Not if I can help it, baby girl.<eos> - You can help it. - Yeah?<eos> - By not fighting so much.<eos> - I know. I'm sorry.<eos> But it's weird other times you guys seem like you really love each other, like in the movies.
We have got tons more business to do, my friend.<eos> We are not done taking this town by storm.<eos> I'm not sure if this town is done taking us by storm from behind...<eos> - Always.<eos> ...without so much as a reach-around.<eos> Boys and girls.<eos> Oh, we're cheers-ing.<eos> To hard cocks, wet pussies, bald heads, Smurfs, and weathering the storm.<eos> Are you Jewish?<eos> I'm not sure if it's the whiskey talking, but I fucking love you guys.
A piece of candy, dear?<eos> But I like it when Granny's here.<eos> That's enough candy perhaps?<eos> Your father's right.<eos> You shouldn't eat too much candy!<eos> Come on, one last one.<eos> It's the last one.<eos> That was the one before last.<eos> There you go! "Another piece of candy, dear?"<eos> You can't say I didn't warn you.
And the prices here are reasonable.<eos> - You think so?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Look how adorable they are!<eos> - It's love at first sight!<eos> - We'll soon be marrying them!<eos> One less worry for us, honey.<eos> Nicholas is all set!<eos> Nicholas do you take Isabelle to be your wife?<eos> I declare you man and wife.
What are you talking about?<eos> You're up.<eos> Lourdes.<eos> She said you would be.<eos> You look amazing.<eos> You want to see Lexi?<eos> I'll bring you to her.<eos> The fact is, there is no war here.<eos> This is a place committed to peace, to nonviolence.<eos> You can commit to whatever you want, Lourdes.
Gilligan, you never had $3 million before. Where'd you get all this stuff?<eos> Get the hell out of here now!<eos> - Jesus. Are you with them?<eos> You trading information for skitter favors?<eos> I ain't trading anything with anyone.<eos> You forget, junior, I've been in jail before.<eos> I understand how to work the system.<eos> Now, get the hell out of here. We just thought you could help us.<eos> There is no more us.<eos> Next time you want to reinvent the rat race, find yourself another rat.
But you guys have any better suggestions?<eos> Been a long time, Cochise.<eos> Too long.<eos> I didn't think it was gonna take four months for this to light up.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I would have gotten here sooner if I could, but I found this perimeter to be unexpectedly impenetrable.<eos> No, I mean the Volm.<eos> Where the hell did you guys go?<eos> Did your father turn his back on us?<eos> My father doesn't consider you much at all when it comes to larger Volm operations.
The Kamiya Kasshin sword style is to save people...<eos> A sword shouldn't be corrupted by murder.<eos> A sword to save others...<eos> Like I thought, those clothes suit you.<eos> I'll leave Kaoru and Yahiko in your care.<eos> Himura Battosai, surrender!<eos> This dojo is surrounded by police!<eos> You have nowhere to escape.<eos> Surrender now!<eos> You guys! How dare you?
You wanted him to kill Shishio...<eos> now you obey Shishio?<eos> If you want to capture Kenshin, kill me first!<eos> - Arrest him!<eos> - Megumi-dono....stay back.<eos> - Get him!<eos> Megumi-dono, I'm grateful.<eos> Kenshin!<eos> That's enough.<eos> I've no reason to fight any of you.
Kenshin!<eos> - I'll help.<eos> - Yahiko.<eos> You're still alive.<eos> It's great that you're okay.<eos> Lord Aoshi!<eos> It's been tough on you guys...<eos> It's great you're okay.<eos> What're you saying?<eos> We didn't go to fight for you!
This was found on his body.<eos> ﻿He was found in the woods<eos> ﻿Mauritz Lauer, better known as Krypton<eos> ﻿Morning!<eos> ﻿Get out!<eos> ﻿Get lost!<eos> ﻿What the fuck?<eos> you need us!<eos> ﻿What?<eos> ﻿I need you?
Your money is no good here.<eos> You risked your life to save mine.<eos> I think about it every day.<eos> A few pieces of hardware doesn't begin to make us even.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, with that being said, I've got to ask, what are you gonna do with the guns?<eos> Target practice.<eos> Not below Canal Street, you hear me?<eos> You got it.<eos> All right, then. Package will be waiting for you downstairs.
The safe is a Xerxes XO series.<eos> That's no problem.<eos> It's not gonna be easy.<eos> Nothing worthwhile ever is.<eos> And then what?<eos> And then you don't call me.<eos> You don't e-mail me.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Y'all are gonna have the cops, the feds, and the Ukrainian mafia after you.<eos> I don't know you anymore.
- Has she no shame?<eos> Get out, you stupid cunt.<eos> If she would leave, vampires....<eos> Vampire lover, I wanna fucking kill you.<eos> I can hear you.<eos> I can hear each and every one of you.<eos> At least Lettie Mae's got the decency to say what she thinks to my face.<eos> I lived in Bon Temps my whole life.<eos> And I love this town.<eos> And I've known all of you my whole life.

- Need I remind you,<eos> J.R.'s plan was that we all work together.<eos> With the way you've been behaving lately... making unilateral decisions, fighting us at every turn... you gave us no choice.<eos> Why the hell are you even here, Uncle Bobby?<eos> The funny thing about being a railroad commissioner is that you cannot be a shareholder of an oil/gas company at the same time.<eos> I divested my shares, signed everything over to Christopher.<eos> And, you know, the funny thing about telecommuting these days is that when I'm not needed in Austin, the commission has no problem with me leasing an office right here in Dallas.<eos> And luckily for the commissioner, we have just such an office.<eos> - I didn't even have to move my stuff. - [Chuckles]<eos> Malign me all you want.
This ends now.<eos> Dallas S03E36 "Hurt"<eos> Why did you call me here?<eos> Your father didn't kill J.R.<eos> Your father was framed.<eos> It's all here in a letter J.R. wrote and trusted to Bobby.<eos> What is she talking about?<eos> Cliff didn't kill J.R.<eos> J.R. only wanted it to look that way, and he asked Bobby to pull it off.<eos> Bobby's been lying to all of you. You helped him frame an innocent man.
His third and last living son.<eos> I am your prince.<eos> I swear it by the Drowned God.<eos> What is dead may never die. What is dead may never die.<eos> And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?<eos> Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell.<eos> He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow ironborn.<eos> And what does Lord Bolton want?<eos> You are fading from sickness, you are badly outnumbered, and you're hundreds of miles from the sea.<eos> Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold.
She said she didn't want to live any more.<eos> She stood on the edge of that Moon Door.<eos> He tried to reason with her, promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...<eos> It's not your fault, sweet girl.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You could see it in the way she raised that boy.<eos> Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.<eos> Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.<eos> Apologies, my lady.<eos> And to you as well, Baelish.
What's this?<eos> A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon.<eos> You spied on her.<eos> Who gave you this?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> - Have you told her?<eos> - I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man, rather than go behind your back.<eos> Let me speak with her in private.<eos> You'll never be alone with her again.<eos> Why did the usurper pardon you?
When you were married.<eos> When your brother died.<eos> You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?<eos> - I...<eos> - Yes or no?<eos> - Khaleesi. - Don't call me that.<eos> Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?<eos> Yes.<eos> That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.<eos> I stopped you from drinking his wine.
That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.<eos> I stopped you from drinking his wine.<eos> Because you knew it was poisoned.<eos> I suspected.<eos> You betrayed me from the first.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I never meant...<eos> Please, Khaleesi, forgive me.<eos> You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father<eos> - and stole my brother's throne... - I have protected you,

Little shit deserved to die, but poison...<eos> Poison's a woman's weapon.<eos> Men kill with steel.<eos> That's your stupid pride talking.<eos> It's why you'll never be a great killer.<eos> I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.<eos> I'd pay good money to see that.<eos> You should have let me burn it.<eos> It's a fleabite.<eos> That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
Never, my lady.<eos> I'm your squire.<eos> I've made it this far in the world without a squire.<eos> I don't see why I need one now.<eos> All knights have squires, my lady.<eos> I'm not a knight.<eos> And I'm not a slaver, either.<eos> I don't own you.<eos> I swore an oath, my lady.<eos> I am releasing you from that oath.

The wildling army's only an army because of Mance.<eos> He united 100 warring tribes.<eos> Without Mance, they lose their leader.<eos> They lose their purpose.<eos> They go back to fighting each other.<eos> Scatter back to their homes.<eos> Without Mance?<eos> You're going to kill him?<eos> I'm gonna try.<eos> They'll never let you within 100 yards of him.
Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons.<eos> Thank you for seeing me, Your Grace.<eos> My name is Fennesz.<eos> I can speak the Common Tongue, if you wish.<eos> You speak it very well.<eos> Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal.<eos> I was tutor to his children.<eos> I taught them languages and history.<eos> They know a great deal about your family because of me.<eos> Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much.
I do not mean to offend, Your Grace.<eos> I went to one of these places.<eos> The young prey on the old, take what they want and beat us if we resist.<eos> My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order, my friend, this I promise you.<eos> Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve?<eos> With my master, I was a teacher.<eos> I had the respect and love of his children.<eos> What is it that you want from me?<eos> Your Grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal.<eos> You want to return to a man who owned you like a goat or a chair?
Save yourself, now!<eos> Come with me, Brandon Stark.<eos> He is lost.<eos> Come with me or die with him.<eos> Go with them.<eos> They cannot follow us.<eos> The power that moves them is powerless here.<eos> Who are you?<eos> The First Men called us the Children, but we were born long before them.<eos> Come, he waits for you.
The First Men called us the Children, but we were born long before them.<eos> Come, he waits for you.<eos> You're the three-eyed raven?<eos> I've been many things.<eos> Now I am what you see.<eos> My brother, he led us to you and now he...<eos> He knew what would happen.<eos> From the moment he left, he knew and he went anyway.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I've been watching you.
Did you hear that, Podrick?<eos> Only 10 more miles to the Bloody Gate.<eos> Are you a knight? No.<eos> But you know how to use that sword?<eos> I do.<eos> Does it have a name?<eos> Oathkeeper.<eos> Mine's Needle.<eos> Good name.<eos> Who taught you how to fight?
Her aunt in the Eyrie is dead.<eos> Her mother's dead. Her father's dead.<eos> Her brother's dead.<eos> Winterfell is a pile of rubble.<eos> There is no safety, you dumb bitch.<eos> You don't know that by now, you're the wrong one to watch over her.<eos> And that's what you're doing?<eos> Watching over her?<eos> Aye, that's what I'm doing.<eos> I have no wish to kill you, Ser.
Watching over her?<eos> Aye, that's what I'm doing.<eos> I have no wish to kill you, Ser.<eos> I'm not a knight.<eos> Arya!<eos> Arya!<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - She was just here.<eos> Why weren't you watching her? I was watching you.<eos> I thought you might need some help.
She's in there.<eos> You're afraid of a dead whore?<eos> You shot me.<eos> You're no son of mine.<eos> I am your son.<eos> I have always been your son.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Quickly.<eos> Trust me, my friend.<eos> I've brought you this far.
That's how you kill a man.<eos> ( grunting )<eos> ( neck snaps )<eos> ( groaning )<eos> The fuck you doing?<eos> There'sa price onyourhead.<eos> Guess that's what the king does when you tell him to fuck off.<eos> The king's dead.<eos> Hedrankpoisonedwine athisownwedding.<eos> The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers.
Won't that make for a great song?<eos> I hope to hear them sing it one day.<eos> (birdscreeching)<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> Your door is well guarded, but your window is not.<eos> I swam to an island a mile offshore for these.<eos> Don't do that again.<eos> Never met a woman who didn't like wildflowers.<eos> These are my private quarters.<eos> If I want you here, I will summon you.
Any enemy anywhere.<eos> Let me do what I do best.<eos> Very well.<eos> Do what you do best.<eos> Take off your clothes.<eos> ( knocks )<eos> Oh.<eos> Come in, my queen.<eos> Please.<eos> I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady.
She's Arya's last living relative with money.<eos> She hates the Lannisters.<eos> Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who.<eos> Sansa could be there, too.<eos> Aye, my lady.<eos> Could be.<eos> You sure about this?<eos> No.<eos> (dooropens)<eos> I imagined you'd be back at the brothel at this hour.
Oh.<eos> Cersei approached me.<eos> Wespokeagreatdeal aboutherdaughter.<eos> How worried your sister is about her.<eos> Shewastrying veryhardto pretend shehadnotcome toswayme againstyou .<eos> Ithinkshemay haveeven believeditherself.<eos> Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.<eos> It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions.<eos> It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters.<eos> She desperately wants to see you killed.
Your Grace, if you'd like to sit, I'm sure that--<eos> We've been here since midday.<eos> Easterners have a difference sense of time, I've often found.<eos> Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos.<eos> Together, we were going to run three shiploads of the finest--<eos> Welcome to the Iron Bank.<eos> Please, sit.<eos> What can we do for you, Lord Stannis?
Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship.<eos> Icannotbringbackhisgoats , but I will see he is paid their value three times over.<eos> Send the next one in.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Queen Daenerys.<eos> Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated.<eos> I thank you.<eos> Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.<eos> Then it is my honor to receive you.
I thank you.<eos> Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen.<eos> Then it is my honor to receive you.<eos> My father, one of Meereen's most respected and beloved citizens, oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks.<eos> This pyramid included.<eos> For that, he has my gratitude.<eos> I should be honored to meet him.<eos> You have, Your Grace.<eos> You crucified him.<eos> I pray you'll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly.
Where?<eos> Lys?<eos> I have an ear for accents.<eos> I've lost my accent entirely.<eos> I have an ear for that as well.<eos> How did you get here?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> One you don't like telling people.<eos> People I trust.<eos> My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting.
This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool.<eos> He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast.<eos> She wore this necklace the day of the wedding.<eos> Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside.<eos> Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?<eos> It was.<eos> The Strangler.<eos> A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess.<eos> And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.<eos> "I will hurt you for this.

I know that he's guilty.<eos> He and Sansa planned it together.<eos> Silence!<eos> Continue.<eos> She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother.<eos> She blamed their deaths on the king.<eos> Tyrion was happy to help.<eos> He hated Joffrey.<eos> He hated the queen.<eos> He hated you, my lord.
Remember?<eos> That was before he married Sansa.<eos> After that, all he wanted was her.<eos> But she wouldn't let him into her bed.<eos> So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her.<eos> I wish to confess.<eos> I wish...<eos> to confess.<eos> You wish to confess?<eos> I saved you.

You are not on trial for being a dwarf.<eos> Oh, yes, I am.<eos> I've been on trial for that my entire life.<eos> Have you nothing to say in your defense?<eos> Nothing but this--<eos> I did not do it.<eos> I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had.<eos> Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores.<eos> I wish I was the monster you think I am.<eos> I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you.
Like, now.<eos> Plane, train, automobile, whatever.<eos> Take my car. it's parked down at the docks, I'll text you to where.<eos> Put your number in Cami's phone.<eos> Most of the quarter is shut down right now, we'll have to walk.<eos> And the sun is taking forever to go down.<eos> Hey, no tears.<eos> Promise you'll meet us as soon as it gets dark out.<eos> Yeah, don't worry about me.<eos> Just don't let them find you.
Sister, come to help us find our stray?<eos> We can't let your secret weapon get in the wrong hands, can we?<eos> For the record, we are moments away from retrieving her.<eos> I recognize that tone of voice, Niklaus.<eos> Clearly, you have some diabolical machination. What is it?<eos> Timothy.<eos> Might I have a word?<eos> Cami, hey, it's me. Again.<eos> Stalking you.<eos> Just really need to know where you guys are, so I can meet you before the sun comes up, again.
What have you done now? I heard screaming.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Just my assistant.<eos> She's a mad little girl, you understand? And what's this?<eos> You always take company property home with you?<eos> Let me have a look at it.<eos> You can have a look when you show me a warrant, Inspector.<eos> I can have that warrant in a number of hours, editor!<eos> Claudio, Veronica, Cesare.<eos> I'll find the killer who killed you.
So who's this guy?<eos> That must be his brother Goki.<eos> I never even knew he had a brother.<eos> There are a lot of things that you and even I don't know about him.<eos> Gotetsu.<eos> Ansatsuken style, teaches three principal special techniques to generate Hado, with devastating effect.<eos> Tatsumaki Senpu-kyaku,<eos> Shoryuken, and Hadoken!<eos> The Shoryuken... One must generate a sudden surge of Ki energy in the muscles of your legs.<eos> This Hado will allow your muscles to contract with extraordinary force propelling you high into the air.

One must generate a sudden surge of Ki energy in the muscles of your legs.<eos> This Hado will allow your muscles to contract with extraordinary force propelling you high into the air.<eos> Whilst doing this you must simultaneously concentrate on a separate surge of Ki into your punching fist.
So that you not only strike your target, but aim to obliterate it!<eos> Understood Goken? Yes!<eos> Understand Goki? Yes.<eos> Then begin!<eos> - Shoryuken!<eos> - Shoryuken!<eos> Sensei.<eos> Goken-sensei?<eos> We have talked enough about Hado for one day.<eos> Both of you go and cool off.
Again.<eos> Summon your own Ki, like an army, to unleash hell and destruction!<eos> Traditional Ansatsuken is a killing art developed for one purpose.<eos> What became of Goki?<eos> Yeah, how come you've never mentioned him before?<eos> He, like my Master is dead.<eos> But, Shisho, I--<eos> Enough answers for now.<eos> It's late.<eos> Go inside, get some rest, both of you.
Why?<eos> To protect Goken and you!<eos> Look at you.<eos> Your body is twisted by the power of Satsui no Hado.<eos> Yet you think you can master its greatest prize?<eos> You fool!<eos> I thank you for raising me as your own, and for taking me this far in my training.<eos> I am honored that you chose me as your student.<eos> Goki, what is it?<eos> I heard you all shouting in there.
It represents immortal glory. The person you are striving to be.<eos> Farewell, Goki.<eos> One day I'll make you proud.<eos> Until we meet again...<eos> In this life or the next.<eos> To conquer Dark Hado, I must immerse myself in a state of Satsui no Hado until we become one.<eos> If my spirit is strong enough, I may survive, and if not, the process could consume me, and be my end.<eos> I'll pay the price gladly.<eos> Master?<eos> May I speak with you?
Let's see if I can remember a word of English.<eos> I'm proud of you, Goken.<eos> I could not have asked for a more diligent, hardworking student.<eos> I pass on to you not only my knowledge of combat, but also that of life.<eos> Likewise.<eos> I could not have asked for a better Sensei or father.<eos> I know you will strive to find the right balance.<eos> I think the time has come. Embark on your Musha Shugyo.<eos> Yes, Sensei.<eos> I will not disappoint you.
Jump! Jump!<eos> Argh!<eos> Watch and learn, Ken.<eos> You know, man, for a country bumpkin, you sure know how to play video games.<eos> We Japanese made these games.<eos> It's in the blood.<eos> Is the new game any good?<eos> It's pretty rad, Sensei.<eos> You wanna try?<eos> I dare not for fear of putting you both to shame.
Well then, I shall be waiting.<eos> The day we next meet will be the last for one of us.<eos> When the time is perfect, you will know.<eos> Ryu, Ken.<eos> A milestone moment is upon you.<eos> An Ansatsu ken tradition-- A rite of passage is ready to be undertaken by you both.<eos> Congratulations on coming this far.<eos> Thank you, Sensei.<eos> One cannot truly call himself a warrior until he has stared death and defeat in the face and shown the courage to overcome it.<eos> For three days and three nights you will live off the land with one focus to prepare yourselves for combat.
Goki is my demon to face alone.<eos> I cannot allow him to become Ryu's.<eos> How is your head?<eos> Broken.<eos> And how about the hand, Ken?<eos> Not too bad.<eos> Good.<eos> Then I think it's time. Time?<eos> Time for what?<eos> Time for the two of you to leave me.
Then I think it's time. Time?<eos> Time for what?<eos> Time for the two of you to leave me.<eos> You recently completed the last milestone of your training under me.<eos> You can now call yourselves warriors.<eos> Be proud of your achievement.<eos> The time has come for you to begin the Musha Shugyo.<eos> But, Sensei, we have another year left.<eos> Our training is not complete.<eos> I'm sure, after what happened you have many questions but trust me, your Shugyo will lead you on a path of self-discovery giving you answers I could never give you.
Tomorrow. What?<eos> You're kidding?<eos> No, Ken...<eos> Your father has made the travel arrangements from his end.<eos> You are finally going home.<eos> I appreciate what you are saying, Master...<eos> This feeling I have-- I don't feel comfortable leaving the Dojo yet. Leaving you...<eos> I understand, Ryu.<eos> This is difficult for me, too.<eos> But know this is a painful but absolutely necessary step for you both.
I've poured all of my knowledge and wisdom into you.<eos> I love you like a son.<eos> Be strong.<eos> Be strong.<eos> As fast as the wind, as quiet as the forest as daring as fire and immovable as the mountain.<eos> Nice belt.<eos> Adventure's just beginning, bro.<eos> Senzo, let's go!<eos> This may well be my last entry.<eos> All that I know is contained within these pages and in the lessons I have taught you.
This is my new home, and I love it.<eos> Help me in the kitchen.<eos> Okay, but I'm not touching anything.<eos> I'm sure the girl who let me in has hep c.<eos> Dad?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm worried about Ali.<eos> I think he's jumping into marriage because he thinks he has to.<eos> He's got classic older child syndrome.<eos> He'll do anything to make you and mom happy.
You hit me.<eos> I feel sick.<eos> Please don't cry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You have to forgive me.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Just some guy at the bar. We were just drinking.<eos> And you were like, "want to kiss a lesbian?"<eos> It only lasted a second.<eos> I was watching you. It was forever.
Highly doubtful.<eos> He never talks about her or his brother.<eos> That's probably because he caught her and his brother in bed together.<eos> Don't worry, they're professionals.<eos> They'll make it work.<eos> Why would I be worried?<eos> 'Cause I see the way you look at him.<eos> This is gonna be the most frakked-up family reunion ever.<eos> Raptor 47 to Artic Biosystems, come in.<eos> We read you, Raptor 47, loud and clear.
Henry!<eos> Follow them as closely as you can.<eos> My guess is they're headed for Paris.<eos> I'll try and find out what's going on.<eos> This was no ordinary kidnapping, was it?<eos> Meet me at Bonacieux's house.<eos> I swear, I'll kill you.<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name is Aramis of the King's Musketeers.<eos> I have been sent to escort you and your son to the palace.
Hold the line!<eos> I demand to see the King.<eos> My beloved son.<eos> I ordered you never to come back!<eos> Where else should I turn when I am in grave danger?<eos> You are banished for life on pain of execution!<eos> You tried to steal my throne!<eos> Now I'm obliged to cut off your head and place it on a spike for all Paris to ogle!<eos> Come inside, Sire. Leave this to the Cardinal and Captain Treville.<eos> Please, I beg of you!

She was warned.<eos> If she ever showed her face in Paris again I would cut off her head!<eos> Decapitating one's mother is rarely popular with the people, Sire.<eos> It always looks a touch ungrateful.<eos> The threat she faces must be very real if she's prepared to risk her life by coming here.<eos> But we will find these assassins, Cardinal?<eos> I can't have people running around trying to kill my mother.<eos> Not unless I tell them to.<eos> The King is occupied with pressing state business.<eos> He cannot see you.
You're certain?<eos> Either that or they were the worst assassins ever.<eos> The last time I went up against Marie de Medici she threw me in prison. I'd rather not go back.<eos> If this ambush was staged, I need to know why.<eos> Vincent could have captured the gunmen. They would have talked sooner or later.<eos> He wanted to make sure they didn't.<eos> I've made many mistakes in my life.<eos> I regret nothing... except our misunderstanding.<eos> That is a strange word for treason.<eos> I was only trying to protect you.
It's nobody's business.<eos> If you don't trust me, how can I help you?<eos> There's only one man I've ever trusted.<eos> Making yourself comfortable?<eos> I wanted to ask you a favour.<eos> From me? !<eos> Speak to the King on my behalf.<eos> You seem to be doing that perfectly well on your own.<eos> I'm not sure he believes I've abandoned all my ambitions for power.<eos> It was a mother's love that drove you to it.

At best, Henry would be brought up the child of another, his life endlessly manipulated by those who go to any lengths for power.<eos> At best.<eos> At worst...<eos> You can never go home, Agnes.<eos> If you want a life with your son, you leave, for ever. Now.<eos> And never look back.<eos> There.<eos> You look just like him.<eos> My father?<eos> He would be so very proud of you.
But he'll be happier than the man who is. You didn't really think<eos> I'd take something so precious into battle?<eos> I know.<eos> You kept him safe.<eos> Delivered him to me as you promised you would.<eos> Take this.<eos> Make a new life together, a long way from France.<eos> Philippe wouldn't want you to be alone for ever, Agnes.<eos> I have my son.<eos> I would ask you to come with us... but you already have a family.
I have a warrant from the Cardinal, for the immediate arrest of your prisoner Martin Labarge.<eos> He's already under arrest for the murder of two Musketeers. Ah.<eos> Well, you're to hand him over to us for questioning.<eos> It's not safe here.<eos> I want it noted he's a very dangerous man.<eos> Duly noted.<eos> Very well.<eos> Don't say we didn't warn you.
You know, we both attended the same one, you know, obviously.<eos> It was ages ago now.<eos> Of course, it was the reception at the palace, when the heads of guilds were presented to the King...<eos> Yeah.<eos> ..and there were those peculiar courtiers.<eos> One of them was dressed as a Roman general and wore a lilac-blue wig.<eos> Comte de Simonet.<eos> Yeah, thinks he was Mark Antony in a previous life.<eos> Cleopatra, more likely.<eos> Um... ..perhaps I can escort you to your carriage.
What about Labarge?<eos> If he confesses, you may well receive some form of recompense. If not...<eos> As a citizen of France, I demand my rights!<eos> You demand nothing of me!<eos> I feel almost sorry for him, lodging with that miserly cloth merchant Bonacieux.<eos> First Athos and now d'Artagnan?<eos> I do everything for you.<eos> Permit me to doubt that.<eos> There was a time I found your independence of spirit arousing.<eos> I must warn you, Milady, that time has now passed.
Well, I suppose that was always my problem.<eos> I never knew how much greed was enough.<eos> Maybe I should have took a leaf out of your book, and followed your career a little closer.<eos> I, er... have a proposal for you.<eos> Well, I hope it involves me not getting executed.<eos> It might.<eos> I believe this is something you need.<eos> 30 livres. Is that right?<eos> How did you know?<eos> I've taken an interest in you, d'Artagnan, and it's not as though we're strangers, is it?

Well, she's... so beautiful and...<eos> ..glamorous and... wealthy, and I'm just...<eos> Well, I'm just... me.<eos> You... shine so brightly in my eyes, it puts every other woman in the shade. Good answer.<eos> I mean it.<eos> Look... ..I'm going to win this competition.<eos> Everything will work out for us.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> Choosing a champion from such a fine group of soldiers<eos> - is a near-impossible task. For that reason, I have decided that the only man who can fairly represent you...
I hereby declare the Musketeer regiment the winners.<eos> Ah, yes, now, the prize money is forfeit to the Treasury.<eos> After all, the rules were broken.<eos> We do need to collect our taxes somehow.<eos> It's 2,000 livres I think you said, Cardinal.<eos> You defended your captain with great heroism today.<eos> I admire loyalty more than any other virtue.<eos> Please kneel.<eos> Get on your knees before he changes his mind.<eos> I hereby commission you into my regiment of Musketeers.
I am proud to say her two sisters have made excellent matches.<eos> Blessed me with nine grandchildren, seven boys.<eos> I'm sure you're determined that Charlotte will marry equally as well.<eos> She does bring a very substantial dowry.<eos> Well, that's settled, then.<eos> We're all going hunting.<eos> Prepare the hounds, falcons and the full musketeer escort.<eos> You can hold the fort in our absence, can't you, Cardinal?<eos> Certainly, Your Majesty.<eos> I'm sorry I can't accompany you, sire, but my men know what is expected of them.

All our problems would be solved.<eos> I would have a wife who truly understands me, and France would have an heir.<eos> A hopeless dream, Cardinal.<eos> Monsieur Gallagher?<eos> How many are they?<eos> Five. Maybe more.<eos> Too many to count.<eos> They're in the barn.<eos> Gallagher.<eos> I have a job for you.
Time to go.<eos> Look.<eos> You two ride to Paris and get reinforcements.<eos> We'll hold up in there till you return.<eos> What, just you two?<eos> Alone?<eos> Thank you for the vote of confidence!<eos> We won't be back before tomorrow at the earliest.<eos> There's at least a dozen of them.<eos> In that case, you'd better hurry.
Athos!<eos> You are welcome, Your Majesty.<eos> Our humble convent is your sanctuary.<eos> Do we talk or shoot?<eos> If you've come to surrender, I accept.<eos> I heard a sense of humour can be of comfort when facing death.<eos> Then what do you want?<eos> To offer you your freedom.<eos> Hand over the Queen, I'll let everyone else live.<eos> Or you could leave now and I won't kill you.

Just in case.<eos> What are they building?<eos> Battering ram, perhaps, or a ladder.<eos> A few years after I married, I too fell pregnant.<eos> It was perfect.<eos> I could feel my child inside me... ..moving and kicking.<eos> I had his whole life planned out, what he would do and... ..be like.<eos> And then... I lost the baby.<eos> Six years, and I've never forgotten that child, not for a single day.<eos> I am certain that Sister Helene never forgot you...
SHE GASPS Athos. Let her go.<eos> She is a liar... and a murderer.<eos> And... she is the Cardinal's spy.<eos> And she is my wife.<eos> D'Artagnan, help me.<eos> He's gone mad.<eos> You know her?<eos> So, she is your mysterious benefactor?<eos> Are you lovers too?<eos> Once, before I knew you.
Effort is of no use to me, only results!<eos> I want... Athos and his friends... silenced for good.<eos> Musketeers don't die easily.<eos> can you kill them or not?<eos> If that's what you want.<eos> This is your last chance.<eos> I suggest you take it.<eos> I could blow your brains out now and never think of you again.<eos> I'm guessing you didn't bring me here just to shoot me.<eos> Well, the question is, can I trust you?

He could be yours too.<eos> I hate the Cardinal.<eos> That's childish talk.<eos> Cut your losses. D'Artagnan.<eos> There is no future for you in the Musketeers.
Madame. I've come to see d'Artagnan.<eos> This won't take long.<eos> What do you want, Captain?<eos> Athos has made it clear he can never serve at your side again.<eos> I cannot allow such dissent within the ranks.<eos> I'm sorry, but your future lies elsewhere. What?<eos> Resign your commission quickly, and I'll see no dishonour is attached to your name.<eos> No! I don't deserve this.<eos> What have I done wrong?<eos> I have not come here to judge you.
You're in love with that draper's wife.<eos> Constance means nothing to me.<eos> Well, perhaps you're not Athos... but, with the Cardinal's help, I can still make something of you.<eos> He'll be expecting us by now.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He's waiting for you. Quickly!<eos> What's going on?<eos> Where is he?<eos> Unfortunately... d'Artagnan is unable to attend.<eos> He did, however... send me to look after you.
The penalty for duelling is death.<eos> You will be hanged at dawn.<eos> Two dead musketeers for the price of one? An excellent bargain.<eos> Touch me and she dies.<eos> Well, do try not to get blood everywhere.<eos> He's testing you, d'Artagnan. Shut up. I assure you I am not.<eos> There was a time when you might have been useful to me.<eos> What service can you offer me now?<eos> You know Treville has a letter signed by the assassin Gallagher?<eos> It implicates you in the attempt to murder the Queen.
Oh, get out!<eos> Was that necessary?<eos> What use is a courtesan with a scar on her face?<eos> And you! I liked her!<eos> You cost me!<eos> My friends will be looking for me.<eos> Your friends are tearing themselves apart.<eos> Athos is dead, murdered by your beloved d'Artagnan.<eos> I knew you were evil.<eos> From the first moment I saw you, I knew.
Into making a full confession, yes.<eos> And what use is your confession?<eos> The word of a lowly Musketeer against the First Minister of France?<eos> Who do you think the King will believe?<eos> The King might not believe their word, Cardinal, but he will most certainly believe mine.<eos> Look into my face, Cardinal... the face of the woman you tried to kill.<eos> Hail, Holy Queen, Mother of Mercy.<eos> What I did, I did solely for the interests of France.<eos> It is only because I believe you are sincere in your devotion to the country... that I have decided to spare your life.<eos> France needs you and the King loves you.
Athos is dead.<eos> I should have guessed.<eos> It seems we are both prone to resurrection.<eos> It's amazing what you can do with a bit of play-acting and a pig's bladder full of blood.<eos> Did your revenge... taste sweet?<eos> For a moment... and then something strange happened.<eos> The world seemed diminished without you.<eos> Shoot me and you will never see Constance Bonacieux alive again.<eos> Where is she?<eos> If you've hurt her, I'll kill you. Oh, young love.
I also heard you lost your house.<eos> I wanted to let you know that my home is your home.<eos> It might get a little cozy, but, uh...<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Come live with you?<eos> Well, at least it's a, uh, it's a roof over your heads.<eos> Well, that's really generous of you, Jim.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You guys make yourselves at home.<eos> See you at supper.
Em, please don't wake up the others.<eos> We're all in this together, ali.<eos> At least that's what we thought.<eos> There are some things You don't need to know about, em.<eos> Okay?<eos> It's better that way.<eos> That's not a good enough answer.<eos> Come on.<eos> Some of you may know each other, Some of you may not.<eos> But I picked you Because we all have one thing In common,
Hermie.<eos> Hmm. How about you, paige?<eos> I can say it if you don't want to.<eos> She called you pigskin.<eos> Man 1: I was pus face.<eos> Man 2:<eos> I was newt. Woman 1:<eos> Woman 2:<eos> Whore. But you weren't those people.<eos> That's just what she called you.
We can argue about this in the cab.<eos> Okay? Let's grab our stuff and go.<eos> Spencer:<eos> Come on. Emily: But we have to hurry.<eos> Who's out there?<eos> Couldn't have picked a better place<eos> To end your story.<eos> Shana?<eos> Shana?<eos> I thought I locked you all together at the lodge.
I had a little problem in the laundry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You must have something wrong with the machine.<eos> I can see?<eos> It is a Prada jacket, that's all.<eos> Alright, do not worry.<eos> Let's take for the baby.<eos> Let's take for the baby! You see how he is patient?<eos> I will take my shower.<eos> You are talking.
- I'll take a muffin.<eos> - Here.<eos> John, hurry!<eos> Time for the photo!<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm here.<eos> - Good morning. - Hi.<eos> I was thinking about going for a run later, if you want to join.<eos> Would that before or after your probation?<eos> All right, get together, you guys.
By you.<eos> Why did you let Garza escape?<eos> An old debt.<eos> Plus you told me you have bigger issues to deal with than Liber8.<eos> I did.<eos> There are two Alec Sadlers in this time line.<eos> What else did I tell you, Kiera?<eos> To make things right, that we want the same thing, to protect the future.<eos> First, you dismantle your plan to frame me for Gardner's murder.<eos> I'm no good to you as a fugitive. And then?
How you been, Lester?<eos> - Oh, yeah, real good.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me too.<eos> Yeah, trucking company's doing super.<eos> Got rigs all over the Great Lakes.<eos> Just bought a summer house up Bear island.<eos> It's pretty sweet.<eos> Hey, you remember the story I told you of the boy I put in the oil drum and rolled onto the highway?
The President called.<eos> He wants an update.<eos> Is he upset? You lost track of a $3 billion weapon.<eos> I'm sure he's thrilled. Stay back, Doctor.<eos> Let me reason with them, General.<eos> I can get them to talk. We're past the time for a friendly chat.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, the most dangerous criminals in the world are right down there!<eos> Give yourselves up!<eos> You've stolen property of the United States government.<eos> Come out peacefully and tell us everything we want to know, or you will be locked up and tried for treason!
All right, what's the big emergency?<eos> Ho-oh!<eos> Keep your cookies in the jar. We cannot let Nevaeh get the best of us, so I hacked into your dad's computer and designed Mae a boy.<eos> Not just any boy. The best boy ever.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna go throw up.<eos> Good luck with this, ladies.<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> So I guess our deal is off? Wait, what deal?<eos> A very personal and private deal which is none of your concern.<eos> Okay, when I told you I would cover for you, I didn't mean all this!
How's everything over at Degrassi, huh?<eos> You kids still gettin' knocked up and shot at?<eos> - What?<eos> - Degrassi.<eos> Never mind.<eos> How far is Bifrost from here?<eos> - Bifrost?<eos> Shit, that's far.<eos> - Yeah, it's "aboot" two hours from here.<eos> God bless you, generous angels.
You sure that's not gonna be too late for you?<eos> Okay, awesome!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, what's your address?<eos> Hang on one second, sir.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Can you get off those for one second, give me a pen?<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> Thank you. God bless you.
It's prune juice, olive oil, a little magic.<eos> It's not gonna hurt the baby.<eos> You're not her mother, I'm her mother.<eos> I think right now you're more like her aunt.<eos> Uh-uh, no.<eos> I didn't get me a belly full of stretch marks to be no fucking tía.<eos> Look, relax, she came to me, I helped her out.<eos> She's comfortable with me.<eos> Yeah, too comfortable.<eos> So, as you can see, we have a very exciting few days planned for all of you.
'Our work was birth - the primal act of a woman's life, 'a time fuelled by instinct and by fear.<eos> 'Trusting our instinct can be what we fear most.<eos> 'Our actions are ours alone, and we must suffer their consequences.'<eos> Morning, Cyril.<eos> Doris must be due any day now.<eos> Bet you thought you were done with them! What can I say?
Previously on Teen Wolf...<eos> You, Allison and Stiles need to be sacrifices.<eos> You'll be giving power back to the Nemeton.<eos> It attracts the supernatural.<eos> It will also have an effect on the three of you.
Not murder.<eos> I apologize.<eos> Just go!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I tried as hard as I could. If it wasn't so long ago, I might have been able to do it.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It was a long shot.<eos> In fact, it was a pretty terrible idea.<eos> I think I just ripped a wound open in that poor man.<eos> I never should have brought you guys here.
Listen to me carefully.<eos> Tomorrow, your sentence between legally in force.<eos> Give thanks to our system. Who had the humanity to let you in life.<eos> I would have shot as creatures harmful.<eos> You heard it. Beauty?<eos> We are creatures harmful. Harmful!<eos> I do not doubt for a moment.<eos> We offer you to live 300 km to the East of here.<eos> You find an oasis. The island of Happiness.<eos> It is for you the chance to redeem your fault.
Kristi for short.<eos> Who is in charge am I. You understand.<eos> Yes.<eos> However, it is time to share the equipment.<eos> Divide!<eos> Let me!<eos> Give me that. I tell you!<eos> Forget it.<eos> It will serve you for nothing.<eos> The swampy will eat you.
You will go before they are firing at us!<eos> Leave!<eos> Advance!<eos> Women are of amazing creatures. I have no chance to reach the island of Happiness.<eos> But a man comes in.<eos> He said that there was a chance.<eos> And I am here in the process of obeying and walk in front of him.<eos> Everything calculated by him.<eos> A funny calculator.<eos> And you out of my sight!
You have to he low.<eos> We have to find them.<eos> Not with Pastor on your back.<eos> Alice and Théo have to leave town.<eos> And the jerk at your place?<eos> I forgot about Jacquet.<eos> I said, go easy.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> It's the right thing to do.<eos> My sister can take you in, you have to leave.
I forgot about Jacquet.<eos> I said, go easy.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> It's the right thing to do.<eos> My sister can take you in, you have to leave.<eos> You have to have now.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Why don't you come with us?<eos> Because I am.<eos> I won't leave you alone.
"but then again, I'm not most Sparrowmen.<eos> "And besides, that mysterious green comet isn't going to analyze itself."<eos> Tell me everything you know about this.<eos> Everything.<eos> Over dinner?<eos> Okay, I see.<eos> I've misread the situation entirely, haven%I?<eos> We'll always have the "A's."<eos> First, thank you guys so much for meeting me here.<eos> I'm sure you're wondering what this is about.
Don't worry, we'll find it.<eos> I must have it!<eos> It's around here somewhere, I know it is. It isn't!<eos> Aha!<eos> I cannot continue without it!<eos> I found it, sir.<eos> You found it? Uh-huh.<eos> It's right here.<eos> Good.<eos> Because if you had lost it, I would have taken you out to the middle of the ocean and fed you to the fishes.
...Pope Alexander is left alone with his enemies.<eos> The Spanish bull nears death.<eos> You are revived. You are cured.<eos> Fire!<eos> Pardon me, Your Grace.<eos> My poor horse is tired.<eos> The journey has been long.<eos> Impressive.<eos> You have just handled yourself exactly as a d'Este would.<eos> We have loved you from a distance because of your singular virtues.
My poor horse is tired.<eos> The journey has been long.<eos> Impressive.<eos> You have just handled yourself exactly as a d'Este would.<eos> We have loved you from a distance because of your singular virtues.<eos> I trust you enjoyed the reports I sent regarding our new sister-in-law.<eos> She considers herself a woman of fashion, yet that style of clothes is so Spanish.<eos> Do you at least like the way Lucrezia wears the d'Este headdress and necklace?<eos> Both looked better on mother.<eos> On behalf of the d'Este family and the people of Ferrara, I welcome you.

I will be the most obedient of daughters in all that I do.<eos> "Among all the saving acts of God, our Salvation, which Our God, the God who saves us, has proposed to men to be observed for his Salvation, these three, as the Apostle says, remain:<eos> Faith, Hope and Charity.<eos> And they are to be observed in a special way by all."<eos> I welcome you to Sinigallia.<eos> Vitellozzo, I am disheartened to hear of your illness.<eos> I know too well the horror which the French disease can bring.<eos> Some days I am unable to walk and must be moved about in a cot.<eos> Your suffering is heroic.<eos> Giovanni, may I embrace you as well?
But in Bologna you are the criminal, having murdered half of your court.<eos> I beg you, good Cardinal, ask the Holy Father to show mercy.<eos> The time for mercy has passed.<eos> Actions bring consequences.<eos> - And what say you, Vitelli?<eos> - I will not beg for a reprieve.<eos> The wrath of God has laid waste to my body.<eos> I am dead already.<eos> You are men of vicious hearts and staggering cowardice.<eos> I find you guilty of treason.
- The duchess...<eos> - Revered by some, reviled by others.<eos> The dead often speak the loudest.<eos> Is something the matter?<eos> What could be the matter between a father and his devoted son?<eos> His most Christian King, Louis d'Orléans, Georges Cardinal d'Amboise, and Count Béraud d'Aubigny, Supreme Commander of the Army of France.<eos> Bienvenu, dear Louis.<eos> We trust your noble forces found safe passage through the Papal States? We did.<eos> Regrettably there was not enough time to relish the landscape as we must soon march to Naples.<eos> Our prayers will be with you as you claim your rightful throne.
He wears a skirt?<eos> A kilt.<eos> I am a native of Scotland.<eos> You Scots are fierce fighters.<eos> We must discuss techniques.<eos> You will have ample time together.<eos> D'Aubigny will lead our troops, but with your permission, Prince Cesare and his fine battalions must defeat the city of Capua - at any and all costs.<eos> - When Capua falls, Naples is conquered.<eos> We grant your request.<eos> And tomorrow we will anoint you king of Naples.
Seeing you now in this condition, whatever anger I have felt towards you just sinks into the sea.<eos> You are my love.<eos> I cannot, I cannot bear the thought of life without you.<eos> If you love me, truly and completely be generous and use your witchcraft to separate my soul from my body.<eos> No, you have loved my beauty and my youth whereas I have loved you, in total, body and soul.<eos> We order you as supreme pontiff of the Universal Church to kill us.<eos> You are my day. Now night is near.<eos> Sleep beautifully, my Rodrigo.<eos> Welcome, Rodrigo.<eos> Do we know you? In a way.
I hate you.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> I hate your shitty photos too.<eos> You want to be with some deadbeat girl so you can feel clever.<eos> You don't care about appearances?<eos> What do you take me for?<eos> Shit.<eos> - Did you sleep in the garden?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We were careful not to wake you.
After the exhibition it'll be OK.<eos> - And you've got your diploma.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You smell nice.<eos> Harold made me a perfume.<eos> Harold made you a perfume?<eos> Linked to Queen Mathilde.<eos> It wasn't really for me.<eos> It suits you.<eos> Do you see him often?
And it's done now.<eos> It's a pity not to be able to change things.<eos> We should be able to change what's been badly done.<eos> Are you going away?<eos> I've got too much work.<eos> I'm going to Normandy on the 15th.<eos> We might be there together.<eos> Agnès invited me.<eos> Antoine is there now.<eos> It's unlikely you'll see him.
I need a reason to see my family?<eos> We haven't heard from you in over a year.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We're gonna need more than that.<eos> Come on guys give him a break.<eos> He just wants to see the baby.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I don't see the baby. Do you, Frankie?<eos> I know I should have called. But uh...<eos> I wanted to surprise you kids.
Well, it has to be done my way, with my family.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, let's go to the doctor.<eos> [PHONE VIBRATES] Call me when you're done, okay?<eos> - Yeah, listen, I was won...<eos> - Can you just...<eos> Damn it!<eos> What's the matter?<eos> We can't tie the guy who took our victim's credit cards to her murder, so we can only charge him with larceny.<eos> I was wondering if you kids want come to the doctor with me?
I mean, are you trying to get me killed?<eos> This one already tried once.<eos> Don't talk to me like that.<eos> Don't talk to us like that.<eos> Ali we want you back.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> I bet this one would love it if something happened to me.<eos> That way she wouldn't have to worry about dropping down to second place if I came back.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Aren't you sick and tired of her ordering you around?
Don't talk to us like that.<eos> Ali we want you back.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> I bet this one would love it if something happened to me.<eos> That way she wouldn't have to worry about dropping down to second place if I came back.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Aren't you sick and tired of her ordering you around?<eos> - You are way out of line.<eos> - Am I, Emily? Am I really?<eos> Start thinking for yourself, instead of letting Spencer think for you.
I never hurt Alison.<eos> I was writing a book about her.<eos> A true crime book.<eos> A book?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When I saw in the papers that she had gone missing, I... I couldn't stop thinking about it.<eos> I had to get to the bottom of the story.<eos> Did you know who I was when we met?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I knew who all of you were.
I can't let all down again.<eos> Hey. Have you talked to aria?<eos> I texted her a while ago, but I haven't heard back.<eos> Why?<eos> I went to her house at lunch and she is not there And she's not answering her cell phone.<eos> I think I have an idea where she might be.<eos> What the hell happened in here?<eos> Oh, my god. Aria.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> Every secret I told him about ali And about me and about you guys,
I can't believe you've known all this time. You never said anything.<eos> I wanted to tell you, but she begged us not to.<eos> If alison's not dead, who's in her grave?<eos> We don't know.<eos> Does her family know she's alive?<eos> The only people that know are the four of us,<eos> Shana and "a".<eos> Emily, if "a" knows that ali's alive And "a" is the one she's been running from, Then you're putting yourself in danger<eos> By communicating with her. Maybe. Okay, but she needs us.<eos> Ali used and abused you guys.
There's an assignment due today, But I won't be staying for the class.<eos> Will you make sure a real teacher gets this?<eos> Don't get up.<eos> I don't want to accidentally run into your mouth again.<eos> Is that what that was?<eos> Look, it wasn't supposed to happen.<eos> And it's not going to ever again.<eos> I promise.<eos> I'm sure Travis will be glad to hear that.<eos> After court, when I passed the two of you talking, It seemed like there was a look.
It means whatever you order, get a side of garlic bread.<eos> Hanna?<eos> Hi, Mrs. D.<eos> Don't you look lovely tonight?<eos> Are we on a date?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> This is Travis.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Such a gentleman.<eos> I won't keep you.
Why are you going through my drawers?<eos> When I gave Dean his final check, he said that you've been sleeping downstairs because you don't feel safe up here.<eos> Is that true?<eos> Oh, God, mom.<eos> Why don't you feel safe?<eos> Is this about not trusting yourself?<eos> Is there some hidden stash of pills?<eos> No, mom, I'm not the one who's hiding things. That would be you and Dad.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Every time I ask you guys about that summer, you two put up a firewall.
Bad, huh?<eos> Your turn.<eos> Careful, Aria.<eos> Take too much and you'll tell us all your secrets.<eos> Friends share secrets.<eos> That's what keeps us close.<eos> Drink up.<eos> What do you want, Toby?<eos> I can't believe you drugged us.<eos> If I got another "A" threat while you guys were asleep, I could cross you off the list.
The bank called again.<eos> They might foreclose on the house.<eos> What do we do?<eos> I ll leave you to it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I ll call you.<eos> She was just next to me.<eos> - We want to talk to you kids.<eos> - You want to do this now?<eos> - Yes. - Are you getting a divorce?
My mother is very ill.<eos> - Since when?<eos> It s been three years now.<eos> My brothers and sisters and I take turns taking care of her.<eos> That s why I need all of my paid leave days.<eos> There s a lot of organization.<eos> I can t stand them up.<eos> Why didn t you ever say anything?<eos> I don t know... I...<eos> I didn t want to bother you with my problems.
Take the high, yeah?<eos> Very beautiful.<eos> Julia, come a little closer to your face.<eos> Put it around your hand.<eos> No, the other.<eos> Yes, just like that.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Think of something funny.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Hey, I could be you both times kidnap short?
Julia, I need to talk to you.<eos> You'll beautiful every day.<eos> That makes me mad.<eos> Well, we go together a drink, okay?<eos> - - Okay.<eos> - - Just A Moment.<eos> I'll get my coat only briefly.<eos> - - Good Evening.<eos> - - Good Evening.<eos> I leave you better off alone.
Caution, let us through!<eos> Do you have any idea what's going on?<eos> A few guests fainting.<eos> - - I'll go look. -<eos> - Okay.<eos> We are the gain.<eos> We guard the diamonds until everything has calmed down.<eos> Diamond in the command center, Please confirm request.<eos> Let them through.<eos> If one has sent you?
Come on, let's go.<eos> Hey, where ya goin' with that dog?<eos> - Hey, that's not your dog!<eos> - Screw you.<eos> Awesome... grandma and grandpa's house.<eos> You're sending us to prison.<eos> Well, good... I'm glad you see it that way.<eos> I'm sorry about this, honey.<eos> Why do we have to stay here?<eos> 'Cause your grandparents can keep a better eye on you than I can right now.
Here, you take this money.<eos> Where's Phillip, huh?<eos> - He sent us. - Yeah.<eos> Get in here.<eos> Come on in.<eos> We're havin' a baby shower.<eos> Here's the baby, right here.<eos> Here.<eos> Well, we can just take the package and leave.<eos> We won't bother you.
- I don't feel too good.<eos> - No, no, no, no!<eos> Bradley!<eos> I'm coming for you!<eos> You guys see that?<eos> Shit!<eos> Shit!<eos> This jerk has literally no swag.<eos> Hey!<eos> I was looking all over for you guys!
- What?<eos> I've been watching you guys sleep, nursing you back to health.<eos> Scrotal touching was just for medicinal purposes.<eos> We saw those Swagger Jackers sting you, man. A lot.<eos> Yeah, but their venom has no effect if you have no swagger to jack.<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> What the hell were you doing with that gang, man?<eos> You were gonna help them kill us?<eos> You guys, I don't do well with peer pressure.<eos> I didn't really want to murder you.
Hold on a second.<eos> What the hell were you doing with that gang, man?<eos> You were gonna help them kill us?<eos> You guys, I don't do well with peer pressure.<eos> I didn't really want to murder you.<eos> But you would have?<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> I had a moment of weakness!<eos> I nursed you back to health.
Thank God.<eos> Okay.<eos> Get outta the way.<eos> Get outta the way.<eos> Yeah, that's more like it.<eos> There.<eos> I thought I'd never say this, but Daddy wants blue balls.<eos> Attention, everyone.<eos> Attention.<eos> We have some new rules for you kids.
There.<eos> I thought I'd never say this, but Daddy wants blue balls.<eos> Attention, everyone.<eos> Attention.<eos> We have some new rules for you kids.<eos> From this point forward contestants of colour will be granted special consideration.<eos> Yes, I'm talking about affirmative action, people.<eos> - It's the 21st century...<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> I think I speak for all of us when I ask you to give us some privacy.
You want to find this overgrown garden gnome?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And Katnip.<eos> - And stop fucking yelling, man.<eos> Anyway, that's why I'm not allowed to go near schools any more.<eos> Good to know.<eos> Yeah!<eos> You guys!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I missed you guys so much!
Krypton has taken everything from me. And now you take my son.<eos> I'm glad you're both alive.<eos> But this is the last time we'll ever see each other.<eos> I hope one day you'll understand.<eos> Alex, we're ready now.<eos> So, how'd it go?<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you for making me do that.<eos> You guys talking about me at the end there?<eos> Yeah. She said how lucky I am to have you.
It's my job to ensure that they do.<eos> I made a decision and I accept the consequences.<eos> Director J'onzz, I will let you know when I decide what those consequences will be.<eos> The ship has left Earth's orbit?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> That will be all for now.<eos> I just want all of these sugary...<eos> What?<eos> Nothing. I just...<eos> I just really didn't think I was going to see you again. After today.
That will be all for now.<eos> I just want all of these sugary...<eos> What?<eos> Nothing. I just...<eos> I just really didn't think I was going to see you again. After today.<eos> Yeah, me either.<eos> But not for long.<eos> I mean... I knew I couldn't let that happen.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> And I'm sorry I forced you to talk to your mom.

After today.<eos> Yeah, me either.<eos> But not for long.<eos> I mean... I knew I couldn't let that happen.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> And I'm sorry I forced you to talk to your mom.<eos> I should have listened to you.
I should have listened to you.<eos> - I was wrong.<eos> - No.<eos> You believe that people can change and you gave them a chance to do it.<eos> Like my father. He changed.<eos> He understood that I was happy here on Earth. He saw what I wanted and he found the goodness in his heart to let me stay.<eos> So, you were right to be hopeful.<eos> I think we could all stand to be a little more like you.<eos> More optimistic and brave...<eos> I think you were pretty brave.
I think we could all stand to be a little more like you.<eos> More optimistic and brave...<eos> I think you were pretty brave.<eos> No, I just did what I knew you would have done.<eos> And it was terrifying.<eos> But you, I mean, you do that every day.<eos> I don't even understand it. Mmm...<eos> You make it look so easy, to do the right thing that you wouldn't even guess that it's that hard.<eos> But it's hard.<eos> You sacrifice a lot for everyone else and... I know I'm beginning to sound like a broken record here but I admire you.
Return with us to Daxam.<eos> No.<eos> You should leave this planet and never return.<eos> I'm not done with this world.<eos> Whoo!<eos> It is another beautiful day in National City, and the Girl of Steel is ready to take on the world.<eos> I am here to kick some ass, take some names, and do it all with an endearing smile on my face.<eos> So, bring it on.<eos> What do you got for me?<eos> There is literally nothing for you to do.
Until then, I'll be upstairs checking the budgets.<eos> I'm gonna go work on that new Lebeckian code breaker.<eos> Thursday morning knife practice.<eos> Okay. Uh...<eos> Well, what am I supposed to do?<eos> Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!<eos> Fifth time's a charm.<eos> Why can't I do it?<eos> Hey!<eos> What brings you to the rent-controlled side of town?
I have some information for you.<eos> Meet me in the parking lot at 4th and Main tonight.<eos> You're the only reporter I can trust.<eos> So tell me, the nano swarm. How'd you finally crack it?<eos> I'll tell you at dinner.<eos> Come on. It's been so long.<eos> I'd love to catch up.<eos> Jack.<eos> You should really spend some time with the shareholders for a while.<eos> I should let you do that.

Do you have fun here?<eos> I feel good about the work we do.<eos> You had fun with me.<eos> I mean, ruining your eyesight staring into a microscope.<eos> Throwing said microscope at my head when I was insufferable.<eos> I don't like how things ended with us.<eos> You could have made it easier on me.<eos> It's not like I wanted to go.<eos> I'm not here to make it harder.<eos> I just miss you.
And then I realized I had been modeling the nano swarm on the wrong kind of animal.<eos> See, bees need a base, a queen, to revolve around.<eos> We'd been trying to make a nanobot into a queen by programming a protective algorithm, but...<eos> Oh, my God. Murmuration.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - The nano swarm, it migrates.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - It's linked AI sentience.<eos> And it's all controlled through the Spheerical lab mainframe.<eos> And I would never have gotten there if I hadn't been thinking about you.
- Mmm!<eos> That's a nice view, Lena.<eos> It's pretty decent.<eos> Oh, pretty dec.<eos> Oh, no. You did not just say that.<eos> - I'm ridiculous.<eos> I know. - Yeah.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - For what?<eos> I made you choose. L-Corp or me.
- I, uh... I have to go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course. I... I totally get it.<eos> I, um, forgot about something at the office.<eos> - Come on, come on, come on.<eos> - What is that noise?<eos> Run!<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> I didn't hear you.
- Right, yeah. Of course.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> You were just doing your job.<eos> It's all any of us can do.<eos> Winn!<eos> Hey, how's the most amazing girlfriend in the entire universe?<eos> Um, first round's on me, by the way.<eos> Actually, all the rounds are on me. - Forever. Always.<eos> Um, and I got you your very favorite Earth dessert.<eos> Hey, you know you don't have to try so hard around me... - Mmm.
For how long?<eos> Oh, um, well, forever.<eos> You think I'm crazy?<eos> I, no...<eos> Uh... Actually, you...<eos> Passionate!<eos> Passionate, which is great in certain situations.<eos> This is all James, isn't it?<eos> I knew that guy hates me.<eos> No! No, he... He likes you, actually.
Loss does strange things to my family, and I've lost a lot of people.<eos> Well, you're not gonna lose me.<eos> I think when I feel things again, I'm gonna be very, very afraid...<eos> Of the person I might be.<eos> You don't have to be afraid.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Promise?<eos> I will always be your friend.<eos> And I will always protect you.
Thank you. It totally shouldn't work, but it totally does.<eos> - How's my girlfriend, guys, huh?<eos> - What?<eos> Bank robbers, zero. Supergirl, two.<eos> What do you even need cops for in this city?<eos> He doesn't even know what he's saying.<eos> No, he's right.<eos> Why bother trying to talk a guy down when Supergirl can just swoop right in and force him down?<eos> Seventeen hours of "What do you want, how can I help you?" good old-fashioned hostage negotiation wasted.<eos> You're not upset that I caught the bad guys and got everyone out safely, are you?
And now it just has a big, Supergirl-sized hole in it.<eos> A thousand things could've happened from the time of your call to the hostages walking out.<eos> Maybe, yeah, sure, I broke some walls, but I got everyone out of there safely, and that is a win.<eos> Well, you should've asked.<eos> But you never look before you leap.<eos> Because I can fly.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, as being something of a superhero myself, I can say that sometimes it's better to punch, than, than to talk.<eos> Sometimes talking is more hurtful than punching.<eos> Obviously, I've upset you, Maggie.
Obviously, I've upset you, Maggie.<eos> I'm gonna go. No, Kara, don't do that...<eos> No, it's fine. Thank you.<eos> Thanks for dinner.<eos> Babe!<eos> I know you're upset about earlier, but I really... I just want you and Kara to get along.<eos> Kara and I get along great.<eos> It's Supergirl that I sometimes have trouble with.<eos> Okay, just keep trying. Okay?<eos> - Okay, for you, yeah.
Because I made us a reservation at Paka's.<eos> Well, how can I say no?<eos> Hey, Bonnie, can you send these down to layout right away?<eos> Thanks. - Kara.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Maggie.<eos> - Is everything okay?<eos> - Yeah, I was just looking for Alex, wondering if she checked in with you.<eos> Didn't you crash at her place last night?<eos> I did, but she left to catch up with you after you left.
What do you want?<eos> I have your sister.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> A man named Peter Thompson is serving a life sentence at Albatross Bay Supermax.<eos> You will free him within the next 36 hours or your sister will die.<eos> And I know you can, because I know... You're Supergirl.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> I knew I recognized you from the elevator.
And I know you can, because I know... You're Supergirl.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> I knew I recognized you from the elevator.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> The people that I work with, they will find me.<eos> And when they do, you will be in a world of hurt.<eos> So, I am giving you one chance.<eos> Free me, now.<eos> When I get out of here, I will end you!
The kid spoke at Thompson's sentencing, and his name is...<eos> Rick Malverne. He has a house an hour outside the city.<eos> Malverne.<eos> Why does that sound so familiar?<eos> Because he grew up in Midvale.<eos> Alex?<eos> Alex.<eos> Alex!<eos> Alex!<eos> She can't hear you, Kara.
Malverne.<eos> Why does that sound so familiar?<eos> Because he grew up in Midvale.<eos> Alex?<eos> Alex.<eos> Alex!<eos> Alex!<eos> She can't hear you, Kara.<eos> Rick?<eos> Jeez, I haven't seen you since graduation.
I remember when Alex had the chicken pox, I was eating lunch by myself.<eos> You came and sat with me.<eos> I was 14.<eos> And I didn't have the nice house or the perfect family that you and your sister had.<eos> You think we had it easy?<eos> You have no idea what Alex sacrificed for me.<eos> Or what I was going through!<eos> Why, because you had to hide your superpowers?<eos> I was hiding bruises!<eos> Do you have any idea what it's like to have your mother tell you you're garbage every single night?
Red is never good on this planet.<eos> I don't know who you are, but I am not helping you build anything.<eos> You talk about betrayal and people hurting you and then you do it in spades.<eos> I want you out of my office.<eos> And there are several heavily armed guards coming if you have trouble finding your way out.<eos> - Ricky.<eos> - Dad.<eos> All that time in prison, I imagined a day when... I could talk to you without a pane of glass between us.<eos> And here we are. Yeah...<eos> Oh, it's good to see you, son.
We got a ping from her subdermal tracker.<eos> She's not far.<eos> Maggie.<eos> Winn found Alex. What?<eos> How?<eos> I guess you underestimated my sister.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you.<eos> You're delusional. And the second we get back here with Alex, you're going to prison with your dad.<eos> Don't say I didn't warn you.
Four?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No!<eos> Where is she?<eos> - I told you not to go there...<eos> - Tell me where she is now!<eos> I gave you 36 hours to break my father out of prison.<eos> But you didn't listen.<eos> So now, that room is gonna fill up with water in less than four hours.<eos> I think it's time you got moving.
You do not give that terrorist what he wants.<eos> You cannot let yourself be blackmailed.<eos> You cannot open yourself up to that, ever.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Supergirl is bigger than me.<eos> - Alex.<eos> - Maggie?<eos> - I'm right here!<eos> - Maggie, I need to speak to you alone.<eos> Babe, everyone here is working hard and we're going to find you.
- Maggie?<eos> - I'm right here!<eos> - Maggie, I need to speak to you alone.<eos> Babe, everyone here is working hard and we're going to find you.<eos> The water is rising fast and there are things that I need to say.<eos> No. Don't start talking like this is the end.<eos> I don't want it to be, but in case that it is...<eos> It's not!<eos> You're a badass, Danvers.<eos> And you're gonna figure out a way to get yourself out of there or you're gonna hold on until I find you.
We just had our first Valentine's Day and I wanna do more with you.<eos> I want more firsts.<eos> I want to have a first vacation.<eos> We haven't even argued about where we're gonna go yet, or how to load the dishwasher.<eos> Or what to name our first dog.<eos> Do you want to get a dog?<eos> Yeah, um... Let's name her Gertrude.<eos> See, there's a lifetime of firsts that we're going to do together.<eos> So, you hold on, okay?<eos> Hold on until I get to you.
I don't work with people I can't trust.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> You are nothing like your mother.<eos> I see that now.<eos> Please, Lena.<eos> Don't let my one lapse in judgment keep us from doing great things.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> That's all I can ask.<eos> Lena.<eos> Kara. I'm glad I caught you. Um...
Please, Lena.<eos> Don't let my one lapse in judgment keep us from doing great things.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> That's all I can ask.<eos> Lena.<eos> Kara. I'm glad I caught you. Um...<eos> Can I ask your advice about something?<eos> Now's not a good time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can I call you back?
That's all I can ask.<eos> Lena.<eos> Kara. I'm glad I caught you. Um...<eos> Can I ask your advice about something?<eos> Now's not a good time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can I call you back?<eos> Oh, of course, of course.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> I'll call you back.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Listening for her.<eos> But I can't hear anything.<eos> I can do all these incredible things, but I can't punch my way out of this,<eos> or fly fast enough and turn back time...<eos> And now I'm afraid I'm going to lose the person that is the most important to me.<eos> To us, Kara.<eos> Maggie was right. I shouldn't have rushed in.<eos> I made things worse.<eos> I... Maggie was upset and she was frustrated and she lashed out at you.
What?<eos> - I just really have to say it now.<eos> - Alex...<eos> Just...<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Those firsts that you talked about...<eos> I want to have them all with you.<eos> I never want to stop having firsts with you.<eos> I love you, Maggie Sawyer.
- I just really have to say it now.<eos> - Alex...<eos> Just...<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Those firsts that you talked about...<eos> I want to have them all with you.<eos> I never want to stop having firsts with you.<eos> I love you, Maggie Sawyer.<eos> I love you, Alex Danvers.
- Do you object?<eos> No.<eos> Just... Before you do...<eos> Just make sure he remembers that. Will do.<eos> - I need to thank you.<eos> - Thank me?<eos> For what? I was so afraid of losing her that I wasn't thinking.<eos> - And I almost...<eos> - Yeah, but you did the right thing. And that was all you.<eos> All I did was remind you of everything you've been telling me the whole time.
Police are on their way, buddy.<eos> You good?<eos> James?<eos> Let's call it a night.<eos> Okay. I mean, I love him.<eos> I do.<eos> I... I love him. But come on.<eos> JT has got to be the only one holding up the reunion right now.<eos> Oh, obviously.<eos> Here, but let me ask you this, right?
It's...<eos> It's like having a mentor, you know?<eos> You'll... You'll love her.<eos> Promise. You got to give me something.<eos> I have to have something to look forward to.<eos> Okay. Something to look forward to.<eos> What do you know about quantum entanglement?<eos> - "Quantum" wh...<eos> - Polyatomic anions?<eos> Well, when you see what we're doing with them, - it will blow you away.
Okay. Something to look forward to.<eos> What do you know about quantum entanglement?<eos> - "Quantum" wh...<eos> - Polyatomic anions?<eos> Well, when you see what we're doing with them, - it will blow you away.<eos> - I can't wait.<eos> Oh. Actually, this is...<eos> This is her.<eos> I'm gonna have to go, 'cause we're doing our first test today.<eos> Oh, it was so good to see you.
Thanks, brother.<eos> Hey, hey! Look who it is.<eos> You know what? I love these falafels.<eos> Do you?<eos> Because they are, like, the best in the city.<eos> I gotta say.<eos> Yeah, they are the best in the city.<eos> You know that because I told you about this falafel stand.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Yes, you did. And I'm totally stalking you because, dude, what happened?
I'm just saying. This kid is completely shut down.<eos> And pulling him into an interrogation room like some criminal off the street, I don't think is the best way to get him to open up.<eos> So, you're not only a masked vigilante and a photographer, you're also a child psychologist now.<eos> I'm just saying this kid's life has been upended badly.<eos> Okay, first, he's a refugee.<eos> Then his mom ends up missing.<eos> And if he's turned on the TV at all since yesterday, all he's seen are adults yelling about her, calling for blood.<eos> I wouldn't trust anybody either, if I was this kid.<eos> James is right. I've been in there for hours, and all he does is just stare at the camera.<eos> He's looking at you.
Someone help!<eos> Power is running smoothly to the core.<eos> Go!<eos> Come on! Go, go, go!<eos> Go! Get out of here!<eos> Come on, go!<eos> The building is coming down!<eos> It's working.<eos> We did it.<eos> Oh, it's okay, I've got you.
On the contrary, I see everything clearly.<eos> I came here in peace, which you refused.<eos> And all of the ugliness that's transpired is because of your righteousness, Kara Zor-El.<eos> Everything that happens from now on is your doing.<eos> Every city that burns, every nation that falls, for every child of Earth that cries out,<eos> "Why is this happening?"<eos> The answer is Supergirl.<eos> Kara has done nothing.<eos> Okay?<eos> This is all you! Oh, of course you're there with her. The Kryptonian girl who bewitched you.
The answer is Supergirl.<eos> Kara has done nothing.<eos> Okay?<eos> This is all you! Oh, of course you're there with her. The Kryptonian girl who bewitched you.<eos> Mother, you're... you're mad at me here, okay?<eos> Don't...<eos> Don't take it out on this planet.<eos> You are better than this. Anger has nothing to do with what I'm doing.<eos> Then why?<eos> Why are you still here? I'm here to wake you up, Mon-El.
Let's go.<eos> Marcus, be careful.<eos> Mom?<eos> Marcus?<eos> Mom!<eos> - Marcus.<eos> - Mom.<eos> No, no, Mom.<eos> These are my friends.<eos> They helped me find you.
- What I had to do.<eos> For my people.<eos> I want you to know the affection I have for you is real.<eos> Turn it off!<eos> I can't.<eos> Why won't it turn off?<eos> I don't know, she must've made it self-sustaining somehow.<eos> What did you do, Mother?<eos> Marcus. I need you to look at me.<eos> I told you I would keep you and your mother safe and I am not breaking that promise.
You're not alone.<eos> You are not alone!<eos> That is a hero without a suit.<eos> Put the gun down, Mon-El.<eos> You don't want to hurt me...<eos> Shut up!<eos> The Kryptonian girl was right.<eos> You are a hero of Earth.<eos> But would a hero kill his own mother?<eos> When you were a boy and I would put you to sleep at night, you used to say to me that you would always love me.
- Is Maggie safe?<eos> What're we going to do?<eos> Everybody evacuate!<eos> Winn, go!<eos> Supergirl! We're under attack.<eos> - I've evacuated the DEO.<eos> - Hang on!<eos> I'm almost there.<eos> - There's no time. - All right.<eos> I'll meet you outside.
How's the invasion progressing?<eos> Is it as much fun as you hoped?<eos> This planet has amazing potential.<eos> It's gonna be beautiful when we're finished with it.<eos> "Finished with it"?<eos> What are you planning to do?<eos> Build, of course.<eos> Monuments to our people, to our way of life.<eos> Great pyramids like the ones we had back home.<eos> And I suppose the humans will build them for you.
The Daxamites are powerful, but they're susceptible to lead.<eos> A well-placed bullet will take them out.<eos> We can do this.<eos> And now it's time to go.<eos> I'm not a fan of the alien invaders, but I have to say, they did nice work here.<eos> I thought we were on the same team now! What are you...<eos> Hey.<eos> What you said before about Maggie, if, um... If she was on that ship... You were right.<eos> I'd do anything that I could to save her.<eos> So, you better hurry.
Powering up now.<eos> We are watching closely, Agent Danvers.<eos> We expect you to fire when ready.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Over and out.<eos> Come on, Kara.<eos> - It's locked.<eos> This?<eos> - Break that.<eos> I can see why Kara loves you.
Lillian left us to die.<eos> What did you do, Mother?<eos> Humans only, dear.<eos> Disable the projector.<eos> Danvers, this is Lillian Luthor.<eos> We're clear of the supership and safe.<eos> Fire at will.<eos> With pleasure.<eos> Turn it back on, Mother.<eos> I came for you. Not them.

Not them.<eos> Supergirl helped you.<eos> How could you betray her?<eos> I put everything on the line to save you from them.
So, Winn bugged Henshaw and rigged a remote so I could beam us back if she double-crossed us.<eos> Hope for the best...<eos> Have Winn Schott prepare for the worst.<eos> Your stubborn pride still blinds you to the truth.<eos> Why is it turning back on?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not in control of myself.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm not going with you.<eos> Well, I'm not going without you.
Noticed what?<eos> Noticed that we're not getting on the same.<eos> They didn't notice.<eos> Well, Mallandra asked me what was wrong.<eos> - Did you tell her?<eos> - Tell her what?<eos> - That you fondled a student penis. - Can I ask you a question?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When are you going to start liking me again.<eos> I like you.
- Tell her what?<eos> - That you fondled a student penis. - Can I ask you a question?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When are you going to start liking me again.<eos> I like you.<eos> Well, you're acting like you don't. You're acting like...<eos> Honey! Your response when I told you I flirted with someone at work...<eos> Come on, it wasn't about the...<eos> You had the female response, which was to go nuclear and try to destroy our family.<eos> I'm having the masculine response, which is to bury the pain and jerk off in the basement rather than touch you.
- How was your interview?<eos> - Oh, it sucked.<eos> My new thing is I sweat, like rolling cascades of sweat down my body.<eos> Why?<eos> Because the school run is like a contact sport and they're so filthy that, after I get home,<eos> I have to take a shower and, after I take a shower,<eos> I sweat for at least 21/: hours, you know that, and I don't have a reference from Braeband, so that's making me sweat.<eos> Well, just try and relax a little bit, you know.<eos> Maybe use it as an opportunity to make a little joke.<eos> Like make a joke about their air conditioning. If they hire you, - they could afford air conditioning.
We have a restaurant quality blender.<eos> Hey, we could sell that!<eos> You like me again?<eos> I'm trying not to, but, it's not going very well.<eos> I'm sorry your assembly was a car crash.<eos> It's OK.<eos> I don't even really...<eos> I just wanted to make you proud of me.<eos> Just make you forget all the other shit.<eos> I really want to keep hugging you, but you just... Jesus, you really stink of cheese and onion crisps.
They knew they had the guy that they wanted, but they still strung me along for a week?<eos> No, no, that doesn't make sense, in answer to your query.<eos> - Hey, Dave, are you busy?<eos> Not really.<eos> What's up?<eos> Well, I was wondering if you knew of any people that may be able to help me with a mortgage that operate outside of the traditional banking realm.<eos> - Yeah, I definitely do.<eos> - Well, great.<eos> Yeah, but I think what sets them apart from a bank is their interest rates aren't super competitive.<eos> And if you're late for a payment, they will kill you.
That's a silly word.<eos> So, you're back in the Braeband fold?<eos> That sucks. Yeah, but look.<eos> I was watching the news the other night and there's this doctor in Aleppo and he puts people back together after they get blown up and he just stays there and sticks it out.<eos> And I know that's not my situation, but my family is my Syria and I have to work at a terrible job so that they can eat and live in a house, and that's just how it is.<eos> Isn't it more that you just couldn't get another job?<eos> Oh, speaking of Syria Catherine wants a baby.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, that's great...<eos> Yeah, great for you, maybe.
And if it does, it'll be a long, grim march.<eos> - A denouement.<eos> - Ugh, No. - You're in a shit mood tonight.<eos> - I know.<eos> I've just found out I'm, like, 99% barren.<eos> - What?<eos> - I started out with four million eggs, clutches of eggs, and now there is, like, a handful.<eos> I'm just an old crone.<eos> I should start figuring out if I want to be buried or cremated.<eos> Well, I think that you should be buried, because I'd like to have somewhere to go and visit you.
No-one can see your egg pockets or whatever.<eos> We're lucky, genes-wise.<eos> No-one would believe Rob and I are the same age.<eos> - He looks like shit.<eos> - He doesn't look like shit!<eos> He's just a bit... heavier at the moment, cos he's stressed out and he's eating a lot of coffee-toffee ice cream, OK?<eos> Give him a break.<eos> - Come here.<eos> - Oh, don't fuss!<eos> I'm just hugging you.
"Oh, bad luck, you've no sperm left in you.<eos> "What you blow into your wife from now on will just be... "you know, dead... glop."<eos> I'd say, that's terrific!<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> And what if you have the urge to make more babies.<eos> You know?<eos> What if your body's like, "I need more babies!"<eos> And my eggless body can't do it, and so you leave me?<eos> Do you not listen to me?<eos> I would love you more if you had no eggs.

I mean, I can see how it's not funny to you, but...<eos> Can you see how it's quite funny to me?<eos> - No. - Well, look, you can't stay here.<eos> Where am I supposed to go?<eos> - Where did you say your girls were again?<eos> - Spain!<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I think you know why I'm here.<eos> I'm here to bully you into being a guardian for my kid.
I just wanted to say...<eos> I'm back from Canada and it's good to be back.<eos> - OK...<eos> - All right.<eos> I'll see you around.<eos> Mate, are you going to be in there for a while?<eos> There's a toilet downstairs.<eos> That seat's rickety.<eos> You might want to get it fixed.<eos> I was just winding you up.
What's it like being back?<eos> - Is it horrible?<eos> - It's not wonderful.<eos> Well, if it's any consolation, you going back to a job you hate so we don't lose our home gives me the massive horn.<eos> - That does sound nice.<eos> - I don't mean right now.<eos> Not now.<eos> I had a big dinner.<eos> Do you feel bad that neither of us is going to be with the kids now?<eos> I mean, I went back to work and they had to get used to you, and now you're like, "Fuck you, I'm off too".

Grimsville, Idaho.<eos> But, still, it's only a Dart and two buses to see the girls. Yeah.<eos> God, Fergal's looking well, isn't he?<eos> I found this. Look.<eos> Where's that from?<eos> Oh, Sharon used to be a flight attendant for Retarded Slut Airlines.<eos> It's the Saint Mary Step's ball.<eos> Look at the state of you.<eos> How are you, Fergal?<eos> I haven't seen you since the wedding.
It's the Saint Mary Step's ball.<eos> Look at the state of you.<eos> How are you, Fergal?<eos> I haven't seen you since the wedding.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> You still with Harry? Oh, God, no.<eos> No, I left him left him when he hit me.<eos> What?<eos> You never told me that.<eos> - He hit you?
Sure. - ... and to sink his boat.<eos> I sank his boat.<eos> Are you still married?<eos> I just remembered I left a joint under the floorboard of my bedroom 20 years ago.<eos> Well, what are we doing down here?<eos> You OK?<eos> Do you want a cup of tea?<eos> Oh, are you talking to me now?<eos> Mum, I was never not talking to you.<eos> I was just... not... looking at you.
Chris.<eos> Remember me?<eos> I'm still legally married to your girlfriend.<eos> Yeah, I remember you.<eos> You want a beer?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I just thought we should have a little chat because you're spending a fair amount of time in my house, with my son, and I don't care for it.<eos> - Really.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm not wild about you.
Or is it because he left his wife because he's scared of Spain?<eos> Mum, I didn't tell you about the business because I didn't want you to worry about me.<eos> I want you to be proud of me.<eos> I told Sharon because I don't care what she thinks.<eos> And that stuff about Mallandra, I mean, that was just... I didn't mean any of that, you know?<eos> Dad getting sick has changed everything.<eos> I'm going back to Spain.<eos> I just want to sell man bags and be a good dad.<eos> Well, it's all out in the open now.<eos> I am proud of you.
My wife has bipolar disorder.<eos> Our thief is staking out these stores.<eos> He follows his targets home with their new stuff, then he hits their house later.<eos> Melissa and Douglas London.<eos> Their son, Keith, was supposed to arrive home last night and never turned up.<eos> He has his next victim.<eos> This is Edie's show now.<eos> I know she doesn't look like much, but she's ready.<eos> I made him bleed.<eos> For you.
All right, come here.<eos> Well that looks fun.<eos> Yeah, all hands on deck.<eos> Yeah, word got out the killer's got another victim.<eos> Phones have been ringing off the hook.<eos> Now we've got press coming from all over.<eos> Commanda?<eos> Hold up.<eos> Hey.<eos> Question for you.
Did you call him?<eos> The police were at our door, Woody.<eos> Listen, it is a real job with a real wage and a regular shift.<eos> Yeah, and all I have to do is kiss your brother's ass.<eos> He's trying to help.<eos> He doesn't have to help.<eos> Why does he think he needs to help us?<eos> Perhaps because you undermine me in front of him.<eos> Is that what I'm doing?<eos> I'm undermining you?
'Cause once you do it, no one's gonna hurt you again.<eos> Hey.<eos> Tonight you say goodbye to the little girl who your mom shit on and say hello to whoever you want to be.<eos> I can't wait.<eos> I got a truck with a busted transmission and I'm down a driver to the flu so, clients calling left and right.<eos> Heavy is the head that wears the crown?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> So, I ran into my sister.<eos> That's okay, Don.<eos> I know she called you, you don't have to pretend.
How'd you find my house?<eos> Followed you from the station.<eos> Yesterday.<eos> Drove all over this pretty little town.<eos> You even know how to use that thing?<eos> Don't think it's very complicated.<eos> What's this?<eos> Everything I could manage short of selling my house.<eos> Will you walk out of here with that?<eos> I never want to see you again.
She is, yeah.<eos> And for a second there, I thought you were making a plea from the heart but you're just afraid of getting caught, just like everybody else.<eos> Take the money.<eos> Never come back.<eos> Hey kiddo.<eos> You're here- you're here now?<eos> Well I don't understand.<eos> I thought you were... what about class?<eos> Well sure, sure.<eos> I'll-I'll-I'll come pick you up.
No ID yet, but I'm guessing it's connected to the burnt out truck my boys found off Mukwa Road.<eos> Any sign of torture?<eos> It's hard to say yet.<eos> He's wrapped up pretty good but it does look like he was tortured.<eos> IDENT found it nearby.<eos> Our corpse has all ten of his so they're running the print.<eos> Tell me you're up for this right now, John.<eos> What's on your mind, Jer?<eos> If more had been done to stop this guy back when it was just an Indian girl, none of this would be happening.<eos> I defended you more times than you know.
But it could lead the police to your place.<eos> Edie.<eos> Edie.<eos> It doesn't matter because they won't find anything because you're gonna get him out of there.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't lift him.<eos> I'm twenty minutes away from your place.<eos> This has to happen now.<eos> You can do it.<eos> I believe in you.
You go to work, get the drugs.<eos> I'll get the new place set up. Edie.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We're trying to have a kid.<eos> The joke's on me because I found these.<eos> If this isn't something that you want, you need to say so.<eos> He got a cop killed.<eos> He tipped them off, Delorme, and he erased the evidence.<eos> That's the kind of secret that you pay to keep quiet.<eos> You walk out of here with that I never want to see you again.
There's procedures.<eos> He was a serial killer.<eos> You did your job.<eos> They know that.<eos> They should be giving you an award, not a grilling.<eos> Well, it will be over soon and then we can go see Mom.<eos> I told her I was coming this morning.<eos> I'll just take a cab over.<eos> You need to let me be a part of this, Dad.<eos> Can I ask you something?
We seem to be.<eos> Paul, um, can you run this plate for me, please?<eos> Detective, an event like you went through yesterday, something that violent, it can call up trauma from past experiences.<eos> Are you aware of the support services available to you?<eos> I am.<eos> Because these things, they stay with you.<eos> Lidstrom?<eos> Got it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I got you, John.
Where does Eric Fraser get his hands on that?<eos> Internet?<eos> Maybe, but why the cocktail?<eos> Why not just a simple tranquilizer and be done with it?<eos> Because he's not a doctor, he doesn't know any better.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm not saying anything.<eos> I'm asking.<eos> Are we missing a piece?<eos> You're being investigated for corruption.

Yeah of course.<eos> Come in.<eos> Here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you Detective Cardinal's daughter?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kelly.<eos> What's your name? I saw him on TV.<eos> Yeah. He's been in the news lately, unfortunately.<eos> Did he ask you to come by?
-No.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I hate to be the one to tell you this.<eos> Tim went out on the Arkansas River. He's been missing for two days now.<eos> I thought for sure the president would have heard.<eos> I mean, I can't imagine how Frank's gonna take this.<eos> Oh, my goodness! Beth and the kids must be so distraught.<eos> Sure.<eos> But Frank and Tim's relationship was special.<eos> It's great to see you, Claire.
I mean... That was a whole other thing.<eos> In what way?<eos> In... What do you want me to say?<eos> I'm sure I don't know anything you don't.<eos> I'm just very interested in your perspective.<eos> Frank worshipped Tim, would have done anything for him.<eos> I don't know.<eos> If the world were a different place back then... who knows?<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> And then he met you.

I am.<eos> -I serve at the pleasure of the president.<eos> -And the First Lady?<eos> The Democratic vice presidential candidate...<eos> Yeah. Her, too.<eos> But you write speeches for both of them?<eos> Most often for Mrs. Underwood.<eos> Articulating what's on her mind and in her heart?<eos> -I'm just a mouthpiece. -Mmm.<eos> Has she put you in charge of any other parts?
How was New York?<eos> My events went well.<eos> And?<eos> What aren't you telling me?<eos> I bumped into Ken Caswell.<eos> -Does he know any more?<eos> -No, um...<eos> -Why didn't you call him back?<eos> -What? His Treasury business.<eos> The oversight legislation. I understand you don't care about it.
Reception is sketchy.<eos> Good trip? I just came back to get changed.<eos> I need to get back to Francis.<eos> You mad at me?<eos> You shouldn't have said that.<eos> I know.<eos> I know we need to be careful.<eos> Careful is far too small a word for what we need to be.<eos> Okay.<eos> But don't you get tired of being far bigger than careful all the time?
- I don't know what's going on.<eos> - Me neither. Seems to be some kind of network disturbance.<eos> I lost connection on my server.<eos> You know what I'm tired of?<eos> This role.<eos> First Lady.<eos> 'Cause it's never felt right.<eos> It's only eight more days to the vice presidency.<eos> -Mmm-hmm. What's my role? -What?<eos> What am I to you, anyway?
-Mmm-hmm. What's my role? -What?<eos> What am I to you, anyway?<eos> Or you, to me?<eos> I mean, are you my girlfriend?<eos> And when you win... does that make me, like, First Boyfriend?<eos> First Concubine?<eos> About that article... I'm sorry.<eos> I hate apologies.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I looked over at you.
I mean, are you my girlfriend?<eos> And when you win... does that make me, like, First Boyfriend?<eos> First Concubine?<eos> About that article... I'm sorry.<eos> I hate apologies.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I looked over at you.<eos> I watched you watching.<eos> -When?<eos> -Did it even affect you?
How you doing?<eos> Hope you're having a great day.<eos> Um, I am. Wow.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um... Good news.<eos> I'm going to be hitting you up with that child support payment that was... that I actually sent to you but was actually lost, apparently.<eos> So that'll be coming your way, so that's... that's great.<eos> Hey, you know, I've been thinking... reminiscing... about how we all used to go kayaking on that little river near your mom's.<eos> Best family times ever.<eos> And also, I want to give you a heads up about the phone bill.
- I can't.<eos> - I'm married. Yeah.<eos> You were telling me.<eos> That's right. That's right, right before you stabbed me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm fucking married, so...<eos> Listen.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm going to help you out.
If he does, I'm going to fire him.<eos> That is cool.<eos> You want to watch?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'm jacked about this.<eos> You're hard.<eos> It's not just that.<eos> His Luxembourg numbers were all fucked up.<eos> I had to bring back that nice little Asian kid to shore up his piping.<eos> And hey, if you're missing me, well, I wanted to make a little something special for you... if you are, so...
- Don't, actually.<eos> - I won't. Don't you die on me! Live!<eos> Live, damn you!<eos> My God! My God!<eos> I'm alive!<eos> Jesus Christ, I thought I was dead!<eos> That was so fucking close.<eos> Balls move, man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, I have herpes. You probably got it now, too.
But not here.<eos> Look, baby, wherever we go, our baby's gonna be a part of my bloodline.<eos> And it won't be at peace if it's not connected to its heritage.<eos> A heritage that could get us all killed - just for being who we are?<eos> - No. See, because when I was growing up, this place was a paradise for witches.<eos> This was the best place in the world to be if you were a kid and you had a little bit of magic in your bones.<eos> That's the New Orleans I remember, and that's... the New Orleans I want to raise our kid in.<eos> Give me six months, Eva.<eos> Baby, give me six months, and I promise you I will find a way to make sure Marcel Gerard never sets foot in the Tremé.<eos> Let me do that. Please. Let me do that for you.
Man, Adam Folsom was only the first.<eos> Whoever is doing this... they're gonna want more.<eos> What terrible things did you tell her?<eos> I told her that you're a hybrid, like me.<eos> I also told her that you're very old.<eos> Other than that, she's seven... We can wait to share the gory details.<eos> Well, someone must have disparaged me.<eos> - Perhaps that crone, Mary...<eos> - Stop.<eos> I've spent five years protecting her from everything, including all the horror stories floating around about you.
Will.<eos> Thanks for coming, man.<eos> You got some news for me?<eos> Not the good kind.<eos> Adam Folsom isn't our only case.<eos> We've got three additional reports of missing kids.<eos> Look, Vince, maybe this isn't your kind of case.<eos> Let me conduct my investigation.<eos> I'll let you know if anything supernatural happens.<eos> I need for you to stay out of this one, okay?
It wasn't magic, it was medicine.<eos> Now, I know you've seen a lot of crazy over the years... but I've never seen you scared.<eos> All right, you gonna tell me what we're up against here?<eos> The past.<eos> Your past, my past.<eos> Eight years ago, you were running this city with an iron fist.<eos> Well, you had a lot of witches terrified at every single turn.<eos> I was protecting Davina...<eos> Yeah, well, I had something to protect, too.<eos> And I wanted to take you down, Marcel.
Hope, too.<eos> Klaus can visit on the weekends, I guess.<eos> I betrayed a lot of people over the last five years, Elijah.<eos> Killed people just to cover my tracks, keep Hope safe.<eos> I was ruthless.<eos> You were a Mikaelson.<eos> You did what you had to do.<eos> The truth is, I'd... do it all again.<eos> I told myself a hundred times that it was all for Hope, but maybe I did it for selfish reasons, too.<eos> When I wasn't with my daughter, all I thought about was you.

I used to make my own paints from flowers and berries.<eos> These orange ones are the most vibrant.<eos> I like orange.<eos> Oh, there's a butterfly.<eos> I think it's stuck.<eos> Yeah, it has a broken wing.<eos> Don't tell my mom.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> A few parting words.<eos> As long as you're alive, you will be hunted.
She can't live without her family.<eos> She's a Mikaelson, and you're...<eos> Enough.<eos> Before you say something you'll regret.<eos> Thank you, brother.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me,<eos> I have a wolf to hunt.<eos> You will let her go.<eos> Fine.<eos> I didn't know you back then.
Enough.<eos> Before you say something you'll regret.<eos> Thank you, brother.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me,<eos> I have a wolf to hunt.<eos> You will let her go.<eos> Fine.<eos> I didn't know you back then.<eos> - When you were with Eva.<eos> - No. Well, I sure as hell knew you.
What's he chasing this time?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> He'll return.<eos> He always was a selfish git.<eos> He died twice and spent five years trapped in Freya's beige dreamland.<eos> You can forgive him a bit of wanderlust.<eos> I don't see you packing your bags.<eos> Nik, you do not need me anymore.<eos> I know that I'm your favorite sibling, and of course<eos> I adore you.
I think you're gonna like her.<eos> You okay?<eos> Rebekah asked me something, who I might be if Niklaus no longer needed me.<eos> Did I have any desires of my own?<eos> And I thought about it.<eos> There was a time, long ago, I do recall, I wanted more.<eos> Somehow I have...<eos> I lost the feelings<eos> - beneath blood and chaos. - Hey.<eos> You can't let the bad things that you did in your past define you.

You're not a Mikaelson.<eos> You don't have a Mikaelson heart.<eos> There's just too muchmuood in you.<eos> It's why I love you.

I told you I can't let you go.<eos> So you have a choice.<eos> Come back with me, or I will make this hurt.<eos> Get away from them!<eos> I know you.<eos> Vincent Griffith.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> Because you have been me.<eos> It is happy you're here.<eos> It wants you here.
How do you know my name?<eos> Because you have been me.<eos> It is happy you're here.<eos> It wants you here.<eos> It wants me here?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It is that thing, the thing that resides within this city.<eos> Within all of us.<eos> It is in you.<eos> Loving you.
Loving you.<eos> As it loved your wife.<eos> With which eye would you most prefer to view your end?<eos> Let it be done.<eos> Dad?<eos> I think something's wrong.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Let him go right now.<eos> Did you think you were unique, Vincent?<eos> That it had chosen only you?
There you go.<eos> Marcel, we've got five totems and we got four kids.<eos> Okay, so who's the other kid?<eos> Nice car.<eos> Hey, do you mind if I borrow it?<eos> I knew you'd like this car.<eos> You're so predictable.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Well, I'm due an adventure, and Saint-Tropez is as good a place as any.<eos> Besides, someone's got to keep you out of trouble.
But she wasn't possessed by any demons.<eos> She had become a demon.<eos> So I don't know, I don't know what happened to our baby.<eos> I don't know if it was the sacrificial magic.<eos> I don't know if it was my attempts to save her.<eos> Doesn't even matter.<eos> Either way, it's my fault.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> I'm the wicked witch in your story.<eos> But if I could track you down, that means plenty of other people could, too.

Hayley is distraught, stay and comfort her.<eos> If this is indeed a trap, if Marcel is intent on killing us... your daughter needs a father.<eos> We're all going.<eos> She needs me, I need both of you.<eos> We're family, we stick together.<eos> What lives in me lives in you.<eos> Emptiness.<eos> Bitter hunger clawing at your insides.<eos> It's still there. And you'll be the one who gives it breath.<eos> You got away because it let you.

And now, it must be fed.<eos> I'm so cold.<eos> That witch, he used their personal items to bind them to the spell.<eos> Hope Mikaelson is linked to that spell.<eos> We got to cast a cleansing spell on New Orleans soil.<eos> Paramedics took the kids to the hospital to get checked out.<eos> NOLA PD will notify the parents.<eos> Hell of a sight.<eos> Powerful man overlooking his city.<eos> I wonder if I could convince you to change your view?
It's more like, um, a broadcast.<eos> And I was able to shut it out, but a lot of people have a harder time doing that.<eos> Like your wife.<eos> You know, there's a difference between what we project and what we have inside of our hearts, what we try to hide inside of our hearts, right?<eos> Now that thing, it took everything that's dark and twisted inside of me and it used it against me.<eos> It used it again my wife and it ended up taking everything that I've ever loved away from me.<eos> So, then, you have every reason<eos> - to want to remove it from this earth.<eos> - Yeah. But let's say that we run into that thing today, Elijah.<eos> It's gonna take everything that you want to keep buried, it's going to use that and make you do exactly what it wants you to do.

I know.<eos> I know.<eos> But don't worry, because as we speak, your mother and your Uncle Elijah are working with Vincent to fix you up.
But don't worry, because as we speak, your mother and your Uncle Elijah are working with Vincent to fix you up.<eos> So you just stay calm and they'll make everything all right.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> The Hollow?<eos> No, sweetheart...<eos> I don't.<eos> It wants those other kids.<eos> I can feel them.<eos> I think it wants me, too.<eos> I am not gonna let anything take you.

It's overrun with evil.<eos> And the only way to take it back is to do one little evil thing myself.<eos> This is not what you are! You can walk away from this.<eos> I can help you walk away from this.<eos> You can't help me.<eos> You can't even help yourself.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> You're in the middle of everything that's to come.<eos> Which is why they sent me here, Vince.<eos> For you.
You're in the middle of everything that's to come.<eos> Which is why they sent me here, Vince.<eos> For you.<eos> That's quite the monster you got lurking in there.<eos> You want to see mine?<eos> I know you can hear me.<eos> I want you to listen.<eos> The heart which beats in your chest is a warrior's heart.<eos> The heart of a Mikaelson.<eos> Whatever hold this power has over you, it is nothing compared to your strength.
Whatever it is.<eos> The kids are attached to that spell: if we save the kids, we save your little girl.<eos> And the sooner you all can be on your way.<eos> Clearly, we're skipping all the hugs and hellos. Vincent?<eos> Trail leads off this way, so, I guess we, uh, follow the breadcrumbs.<eos> Tactless savages holding a ghost-raising rave.<eos> Best make short work of them.<eos> - I say we...<eos> - We split up.<eos> Klaus, you're with me, I'm not letting you out of my sight.
All right, listen, I don't care about our peace, all right?<eos> I care about finding these missing kids and wiping out the messed up people who took them.<eos> Root out the problems, make them go away.<eos> That's what you do when you're the king.<eos> All I see is a petulant prince.<eos> Always with the insults.<eos> You never do learn.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> My time in your dungeon clarified my priorities. My concerns are with my child.<eos> And as for you,

My concerns are with my child.<eos> And as for you,<eos> I can imagine no better revenge than leaving you to the endless struggle to prove yourself my better.
I don't know! It's a sacrificial ritual.<eos> I can't break it unless I kill one of the kids.<eos> No, no.<eos> There has to be another way.<eos> Where are we?<eos> Don't look into the blue light.<eos> Yeah, um... so these kids are powering that ritual.<eos> But there might be a loophole, if I link it to you.<eos> Are you suggesting we take my life?<eos> I'm suggesting we stake you with wood.
I don't know.<eos> I'm not particularly good at either one.<eos> I managed to find an old friend.<eos> Or enemy, I can never really tell.<eos> Here's to a wretched day.<eos> A wretched day indeed.<eos> As soon as Hope is better, we'll leave.<eos> She's all that matters.<eos> Hey.<eos> I want to ask you something.
As soon as Hope is better, we'll leave.<eos> She's all that matters.<eos> Hey.<eos> I want to ask you something.<eos> In the woods, if Vincent hadn't found that loophole... what would you have done to those kids?<eos> Whatever I had to do.<eos> We have got to stop making it a habit of putting our family lives ahead of others.<eos> I don't want that for myself,<eos> We have to do better.<eos> I know today was rough for you.
We have to do better.<eos> I know today was rough for you.<eos> Hey, at least we put an end to it.<eos> Kinney's dead.<eos> But... the thing they idolized... the Hollow... it must have wanted us there.<eos> It wanted to come into our world by anchoring itself to one of us.<eos> So that makes me wonder... did we end it?<eos> Or is it just getting started?<eos> You think it's gonna come after me?<eos> Marcel, I'm-a tell you, man. I wonder if it hasn't already got to you.
- I had a bad dream.<eos> - You're safe.<eos> I saw something today, and it's something that I've seen before.<eos> This city is in danger.<eos> It means the Hollow.<eos> The Hollow is coming.<eos> The Hollow wants power.<eos> The kind that only comes from sacrifice.<eos> This thing is dark, it's angry, it's very powerful.<eos> Everything that you want to keep buried... it's going to use that and make you do exactly what it wants you to do.
The Hollow. It's here.<eos> Please. Please!<eos> Help me.<eos> Please. No.<eos> No! No! Please!<eos> You would show mercy to an enemy?<eos> A fiend who plotted to raid our home?<eos> Mercy... is for the weak, Niklaus.<eos> You...<eos> Look at you, boy.
Help me.<eos> Please. No.<eos> No! No! Please!<eos> You would show mercy to an enemy?<eos> A fiend who plotted to raid our home?<eos> Mercy... is for the weak, Niklaus.<eos> You...<eos> Look at you, boy.<eos> You are pathetic.<eos> If you are determined to prove yourself a weakling, I should cast you out!
Now I think...<eos> I think it's anchored to me.<eos> Then you need a witch.<eos> A good one.<eos> I know someone.<eos> Yeah, I need a New Orleans witch.<eos> Vincent has a history with this thing, and this thing did just kill his friend, so I think he'll help me.<eos> And in the meantime, I'm supposed to do what? Cross my fingers and hope you're not possessed?<eos> That's not gonna happen to me.<eos> Good. 'Cause I'm not letting you out of my sight until you're cured.
Today you will die at the hands of Marcel, unless you kill your enemy first.<eos> Dad?<eos> We're ready to go.<eos> You need to go to the bayou without me.<eos> - Why? - Take Hope.<eos> - I'll be right behind you.<eos> - Why? My daughter nearly died.<eos> I have to make sure the threat to her is over.<eos> Not without me you cannot.<eos> Brother, hearcel loathes you most of all.
I have to make sure the threat to her is over.<eos> Not without me you cannot.<eos> Brother, hearcel loathes you most of all.<eos> Freya will help me here.<eos> I need to know my child is safe.<eos> You and Hayley can assure that.<eos> Mm. Is this for me?<eos> Oh, sweet angel of mercy.<eos> This almost makes up for the whole kidnapping thing.<eos> Oh, let's not forget, that whole kidnapping thing kept you alive.
All right, call me back as soon as you get this.<eos> This is absurd.<eos> I'm calling my guy.<eos> All right, whoever you are, this is the wrong day to be playing games.<eos> Elijah. What are you doing here?<eos> Did you not learn your lesson the last time I put you down?<eos> Does this bravado help to relieve your pathetic fear?<eos> Oh, you think I'm afraid of you?<eos> Terrified.<eos> I put you down twice before.
I need to purify you both.<eos> No!<eos> Not yet.<eos> If the Hollow can look into me, then I can look back at it, find out what it is, what it wants.<eos> It's too dangerous, Klaus.<eos> This thing came after Hope.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll give you an hour. And something else.<eos> The means to kill the unkillable king of New Orleans.<eos> If Marcel comes after you, use this.
So young.<eos> And taken before her time.<eos> While those immortal tyrants continue to wander free.<eos> What is this?<eos> Evil spirit appears to me as the guy I hate, for what?<eos> Huh? To scare me?<eos> If this is all in my head, I could just as easily wish your ass away.<eos> Your wishes won't bring back the dead.<eos> Nor will they grant you solace.<eos> Let's not forget, Elijah killed you as well.

You are here to deliver a sacrifice.<eos> Either Klaus or you. Two powerful souls, both fighting to the death.<eos> Now, doesn't that sound wonderful?<eos> Marcel! Hey!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> I knew this was bad.<eos> I have a witch on the way.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> We're gonna fix you.
The Hollow.<eos> You address no one.<eos> I...<eos> I am not here. I'm only in your head.<eos> I can see your worst fear:<eos> the father that you loathed, the terror that this is how your daughter may one day perceive you.<eos> A depraved demon sputtering psychoanalysis?<eos> Perhaps you speak from personal experience.<eos> Do you come from a broken home?<eos> Daddy drank? Mommy never loved you?
You seem to think Marcel will kill me today.<eos> But he's had five years to do that.<eos> He didn't do it then.<eos> He won't do it now.<eos> I, however, have long had the will to end him.<eos> Now I have the weapon.<eos> Eager boy.<eos> You have shown that you have a talent for brutality.<eos> But can you summon that same beast to do what is necessary today?<eos> When your once-beloved son comes to finish you, will you kill him? Or die a coward?
When Vincent blew the link, he must've set it free.<eos> How do we get this thing off Marcel?<eos> Purification could work.<eos> Unless it comes back.<eos> Best bet, you'll have to send this thing back to sleep.<eos> See, spirits are just another form of power.<eos> They can be channeled, deflected, blocked.<eos> These beads keep me safe.<eos> They prevent any and all spirits from infecting my head.<eos> I could purify some for you, adjust them to your condition, of course.
You don't intend to kill Marcel, do you?<eos> Your father was right.<eos> You are a coward.<eos> Because of you, he's lost everyone he loved.<eos> And now, due to your pathetic fear of Marcel, you will suffer the same fate.<eos> More meaningless threats.<eos> Is that the extent of your power?<eos> I remain underwhelmed.<eos> You think I'm powerless?<eos> I can make you see and feel whatever I like.
You think I'm powerless?<eos> I can make you see and feel whatever I like.<eos> Do your worst.<eos> I know the truth.<eos> The white oak is gone, Mikael is dead, and you are nothing more than a bad dream.<eos> Well, then maybe I'll find my way into your daughter's dreams.<eos> What fun it will be to be in her head.<eos> Ruthless.<eos> Nicely done.<eos> Imagine if I made you kill someone you cared about.
Imagine if I made you kill someone you cared about.<eos> Maybe I already have.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Next time, it might even be Hope.<eos> No!<eos> Even if you could resist, who will stop Marcel?<eos> After all, I'm having my fun with him.<eos> And I will make him tear through your family like you have these people.<eos> Now, you only have the one choice, boy.<eos> Kill Marcel... or he will kill you and everyone you love.
Klaus, I was worried.<eos> Freya, stay back.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I don't want to hurt you. But I can't trust myself.<eos> I trust you...<eos> I said stay back!<eos> I've underestimated our foe.<eos> The Hollow is more powerful than I thought.<eos> I can feel it in my head.<eos> Then let me purify you.
I've underestimated our foe.<eos> The Hollow is more powerful than I thought.<eos> I can feel it in my head.<eos> Then let me purify you.<eos> Okay?<eos> It's burrowed too deep.<eos> But I know what it wants.<eos> For me to kill Marcel.<eos> Or for him to kill me.<eos> Klaus, if this thing is demanding a blood sacrifice, if it's you or Marcel... don't let it be you.
Spelled beads keep me safe from this damn thing.<eos> I bury these here and we're done, all right?<eos> No need to fight.<eos> He hopes to lower your guard with his lies.<eos> Then he will wrench the dagger out of your hand.<eos> Don't be a fool.<eos> I am no fool.<eos> Damn it, Klaus, I didn't come to fight.<eos> All right? Put the weapon down.<eos> My family won't be safe unless you're put down!

Put the weapon down.<eos> My family won't be safe unless you're put down!<eos> End this.<eos> There is no other way.<eos> Need a hand?<eos> I should've killed you when I had the chance.
- So where has it gone?<eos> - It's a ghost.<eos> It could be anywhere, and since we know that it still wants to sacrifice someone powerful, we have to be prepared.<eos> I think I'll hold on to it for now.<eos> This wasn't a gift.<eos> Today proved Marcel's a threat, whether used as a sacrifice or possessed.<eos> Regardless...<eos> What good is having a weapon if you won't use it?<eos> Niklaus, give it to her.<eos> Having a monopoly of power makes you a target, sister.
And here you are.<eos> And here I am.<eos> Excuse me if I don't express my gratitude.<eos> He's changing.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> He put me in the same place that I kept him.<eos> That's revenge.<eos> So... same old Klaus.<eos> ♪ Black bliss for comfort... ♪ Well... I would say that he would describe this as strategy.<eos> You and I, we both know... he's always regarded you as something of a son.

You and I, we both know... he's always regarded you as something of a son.<eos> So did I, once upon a time.<eos> In fact, I used to believe that you were the key to my brother's redemption.<eos> Redemption?<eos> He's never gonna change.<eos> Not even for his own daughter.<eos> Oh, he already has.<eos> She has changed him.<eos> You, Marcellus, you are not needed, welcome or wanted.<eos> You have only been spared purely because you are my brother's greatest weakness.
And if indeed you should prevent the redemption of the cruel, the wicked, the vindictive Niklaus Mikaelson...<eos> I promise you... I will deliver another kind of nightmare.<eos> Sweet dreams, Marcellus.<eos> Elijah.<eos> Elijah.<eos> Elijah!<eos> You lied to me.<eos> I wanted Klaus dead.<eos> Marcel getting taken was not part of it.<eos> - I should kill you.
I get to deal with Dominic on my terms.<eos> You get to help me keep Marcel breathing. So you in?<eos> For a dead guy, you look awfully healthy.<eos> Only a fool would attend a Mikaelson party without a protection spell.<eos> The sister put a barrier spell over their home.<eos> It's old magic... tied to her heartbeat.<eos> Great, when you break the spell, give me a call.<eos> I've got places to be.<eos> Care to share where you're going in such a hurry?<eos> I will kill you.
Marcel is with me.<eos> Then it would appear that I've broken that deal.<eos> Keep that safe for me, will you?<eos> Hi.<eos> I think this is yours.<eos> Hope.<eos> I haven't seen this in a century.<eos> So, you're the little boy who used to live in my house.<eos> Once upon a time, I lived here with your dad.<eos> He keeps you down here because he thinks you want to kill him.
Listen,<eos> I will tell you anything you want to know. Okay? If you get me some blood from your dad's stash.<eos> I'm seven, not stupid.<eos> Right.<eos> You know, you're also pretty courageous.<eos> Come down here and talk to a stranger.<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> I'm a Mikaelson witch.<eos> I'll tell you what, let's start fresh, all right?<eos> It is very good to see you again, Hope Mikaelson.
We should take more family pictures.<eos> There is a reason vampires avoid photographs.<eos> Well, not everyone in this family is immortal anymore.<eos> Freya being one of them.<eos> She's not picking up, either.<eos> I'm sure they're fine.<eos> They're just busy.<eos> You know, this is a fool's errand.<eos> We're not gonna accomplish anything in this mess.<eos> I should be out there... Dodging an evil ghost who wants you dead?

Dodging an evil ghost who wants you dead?<eos> No. You're safe here.<eos> Safe and entirely ineffective.<eos> Your daughter needs you.
It was taunting me.<eos> It was relentless.<eos> The first few weeks were the worst.<eos> You're worried about Marcel.<eos> No.<eos> Let him suffer.<eos> Will someone deal with her?<eos> What is this?<eos> That's a shame.<eos> Things do not look good for you.
No...<eos> Elijah, what did you do?<eos> Four French Quarter witches, killed on consecrated ground, with a ceremonial blade.<eos> This is not how you do it, man!<eos> There's a ceremony! Then there's a ritual!<eos> - The girls got to be selected!<eos> - You find a way.<eos> And then the girls will be resurrected.<eos> Any delay only helps our enemy.<eos> You know, I'm surprised your parents haven't stormed down here looking for you.

You just end up hating yourself.
Okay...<eos> In order to be reborn, we must have a sacrifice.<eos> In order to be reborn, we must have faith.<eos> This isn't right.<eos> This ritual is supposed to be performed by an elder of the French Quarter.<eos> I'm not an elder of the French Quarter.<eos> This is not my magic.<eos> You were the regent of all nine covens!<eos> My own mother, my wretched mother, recognized your mastery.<eos> And let us not forget, you were the one that was selected by the Hollow itself.
My own mother, my wretched mother, recognized your mastery.<eos> And let us not forget, you were the one that was selected by the Hollow itself.<eos> So whatever your doubts, whatever our differences, your gift is irrefutable.<eos> Now, you will make this your kind of magic.<eos> It's done.<eos> I've broken through the last of his protection spells. You should leave.<eos> Uh,<eos> I live here.<eos> Why don't you just kill the guy and then help me clean up the two bodies that are stashed in my bathroom.<eos> Look, Freya, I'm not gonna leave you alone in here with the Hollow's High Priest of Doom.
Where are the others?<eos> As long as I'm the only one with the answers, you can't kill me.<eos> Magically induced cardiac arrest.<eos> Just short of lethal.<eos> Where are the bones?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If you won't give me what I want, then I'll have to take it.<eos> Apisi.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> Tell me or I'll just kill you and ask someone else.
They're in the Ninth Ward now.<eos> In St. Theodora's Health Clinic.<eos> Honestly, she might be dead already.<eos> But if you kill me, then you'll never find out where her body is.<eos> I beseech you... accept this offering as a sign of our faith.<eos> What is this?<eos> What... what is this?<eos> They're angry!<eos> They won't accept the sacrifice. I told you this was not my magic...<eos> They hate you, and they hate me for helping you!
Something's wrong. I have to go.<eos> No, wait, Hope.<eos> It's not safe.<eos> No.<eos> Come on.<eos> Marcel is in the tunnels. Find him!<eos> I need you to let me out of the circle.<eos> I can't. My dad will be mad.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> I'll keep you safe.
I have to go.<eos> No, you, you can't.<eos> I have to.<eos> The Hollow is gonna have a feast tonight.<eos> We can sacrifice the whole family.<eos> Your daughter's around here somewhere, isn't she?<eos> How convenient.<eos> Hope!<eos> Hope?<eos> Davina, I haven't called out to you in a lot of years. Because you couldn't hear me. But I think you can hear me now.
How convenient.<eos> Hope!<eos> Hope?<eos> Davina, I haven't called out to you in a lot of years. Because you couldn't hear me. But I think you can hear me now.<eos> I need your help with the Ancestors.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> If there's anything left of her, she can accept the sacrifice and restore the link.<eos> Davina, I need you to help me bring those girls back over here.<eos> And then you and me, we can, we can work together.<eos> I shouldn't be doing this ritual, because I lost faith in the Ancestors a long time ago, but I never once lost faith in you.
- You're just getting in the way!<eos> - Freya... - Leave!<eos> Please!<eos> Marcel!<eos> Dad.<eos> What happened?<eos> It's, uh... it's, it's paint.<eos> I made quite a mess, didn't I?<eos> Where's Mom?<eos> She's at home, waiting for you.
I made a sacrifice to the Ancestors.<eos> What? I...<eos> I thought the Ancestors were the bad guys.<eos> Yeah, Josh, we need power if we're gonna contain the Hollow, so I called in some help from one of our old friends and she came through for us, once again.<eos> You felt her?<eos> Yeah, Josh, I felt her.<eos> And it's gonna be different this time.<eos> I made her the gatekeeper for all the Ancestral magic that we got here in this city.<eos> So right now, Davina Claire is the most important ally that we got.<eos> If you came to fight, it ain't gonna end well for you.
Yeah, well, she's a better listener than I was.<eos> You didn't tell her.<eos> About our history. Right, yeah.<eos> How dare I deny my daughter the heartwarming tale of the boy I loved as a son...<eos> That is now the man you hate enough to keep locked in your basement.<eos> Yeah, but the thing is, we're not men, are we, Marcellus?<eos> We're monsters.<eos> And I intend to protect my daughter from that truth for as long as I can.<eos> I knew you were a monster from the moment I met you.<eos> Now, I may not have known you were a vampire, but I knew you.
It doesn't matter.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> - Done?<eos> - I got distracted today.<eos> I was worried about you and I made a mistake that could have cost lives.<eos> And that can't happen again.<eos> There's no reason for us to see each other anymore, Keelin.<eos> Stay in New Orleans.<eos> My brothers will keep an eye on you.

My brothers will keep an eye on you.<eos> - To keep me alive? - Yeah.<eos> If that's what you want, fine.<eos> But you should know that when I saw you lying there today, I was terrified.<eos> And all I could think about was how I wish I had told you the truth.<eos> You are the reason I wanted to stay in New Orleans, Freya.<eos> You make me feel understood.<eos> Known.<eos> And there's always gonna be a spell to do or an enemy to fight.<eos> But when that is all finished, you deserve someone who gets you.
I work better alone.<eos> Really?<eos> Then what am I doing here?<eos> You're the only one I trust, all right?<eos> Just look after her.<eos> Meanwhile, I'm gonna track down the Hollow.<eos> I never told you... but over countless years, you have meant so much to me.<eos> You have been a redeemer, a confidant, a mentor, a rival... and a friend.<eos> And at times, yes, you've been... a royal pain in the ass.<eos> Now look at you.

We still have more ground to cover.<eos> What is the point of interrogation?<eos> We know their motives.<eos> New Orleans witches despise our family.<eos> They always have.<eos> Because you are beasts.<eos> Evil atrocities against nature.<eos> Your kind has ruined this city. Yes.<eos> I'm the worst of the worst.<eos> So tell me, is your master going to save you from me?
Nothing can stop her.<eos> Not you, not even the Ancestors, despite what they might claim.<eos> The Ancestors?<eos> I thought he'd never shut up.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Are the Ancestors back?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I could have seen her.<eos> Do you think I would deny you that happiness?<eos> I was trying to protect you, brother.
I thought I found him, but he just vanished right in front of me.<eos> That's not our only problem.<eos> I can't search Elijah's mind and sustain a spell at the same time.<eos> What if you sent me in?<eos> That would require more power.<eos> You stay here and anchor the spell.<eos> He'll respond to me.<eos> Send me in, Freya, I can find him.<eos> Nobody's closer to Elijah than I am.<eos> To place you into the pendant, I would need to channel another witch.
She's young, but she's strong.<eos> Stronger than I was at her age.<eos> Hayley, I would never hurt my niece, ever.<eos> Marcel?<eos> That's a peculiar place for a nap.<eos> It wasn't like I had a choice.<eos> You're fighting a one-man war, Marcellus.<eos> Doesn't seem to be going very well.<eos> Perhaps next time you'll honor our alliance and inform me of your tactics.<eos> Look, I don't need to inform anyone of my tactics, especially you.
Hopefully, that's a good place.<eos> When you find it, draw him out and wake him up.<eos> But be careful, his mind is unstable.<eos> Mom?<eos> Be careful.<eos> I'll be right back, sweetie.<eos> Come on, Elijah, where are you?<eos> Your hair.<eos> I changed it.<eos> I missed you.
I missed you.<eos> Let me go get dressed.<eos> Elijah.<eos> It's me.<eos> I know you're here.<eos> Look at me.<eos> All right, I've had enough of your condescending cold shoulder.<eos> - Talk to me.<eos> - And do what?<eos> That your feelings for Marcel have left you compromised.

Even now when your family needs you the most, he's got you wrapped around his little finger.<eos> You're filled with grief and you're lashing out, but you know what?<eos> He's my brother, too, and I am just as hurt and just as scared without him here.<eos> Well, then you should go.<eos> I'll find the thorns myself, butcher my way through this entire city if that's what it takes, and if it turns out Marcel has taken them, I'll deal with him as well.<eos> Oh, lovely, you're sounding like your old self.<eos> Well, someone has to protect this family.<eos> And there it is.<eos> The excuse that you always use.<eos> You know, if you're so determined to be this way, then everything that Elijah has done for you, including his death, will be for nothing.
Just please let me talk to her.<eos> You Mikaelsons come around asking for favors, threatening, manipulating.<eos> That's why we're gonna make sure you never see Davina Claire again.<eos> Let me talk to her now!<eos> You guys put up a good fight.<eos> I respect that.<eos> Still, at the end of the day, too little... too late.<eos> And that is the last one.<eos> I suppose I should say thank you for your hard work.<eos> Don't make me fight you, Rebekah.

Yeah, of course.<eos> I'll burn it myself.<eos> Freya!<eos> Freya!<eos> Elijah.<eos> Please.<eos> - Mom!<eos> - Tillate... Hope, stop!<eos> Aunt Freya, please, do something!<eos> Hope, I need you to focus on the spell.
I'll burn it myself.<eos> Freya!<eos> Freya!<eos> Elijah.<eos> Please.<eos> - Mom!<eos> - Tillate... Hope, stop!<eos> Aunt Freya, please, do something!<eos> Hope, I need you to focus on the spell.<eos> I'm not trying to fight you.
Freya!<eos> Freya!<eos> Elijah.<eos> Please.<eos> - Mom!<eos> - Tillate... Hope, stop!<eos> Aunt Freya, please, do something!<eos> Hope, I need you to focus on the spell.<eos> I'm not trying to fight you.<eos> I'm just trying to bring you home.
I'm not trying to fight you.<eos> I'm just trying to bring you home.<eos> Tillate ulaz. - Come back, Mom, come back! - Tillate ulaz.<eos> Tillate...<eos> Hope.<eos> If we don't maintain the spell, we could lose her in there.<eos> - Let me help. I can save her.<eos> - Now, listen, I need you to trust me.<eos> This is what we're gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna put you inside the pendant.
Hope! Stay there!<eos> Hope!<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Please.<eos> Please!<eos> Mommy!<eos> Mom?<eos> I can't find you.
Such as?<eos> I know you don't want to hear it, but if we have to choose between Marcel and Elijah... it's not a choice.<eos> Well, top-notch day, huh?<eos> At least you got that thorn stake, right?<eos> I mean, that's a win.<eos> If we're lucky, Vincent can siphon off the power.<eos> Help Sofya, then it's a win.<eos> Well, you don't sound all that optimistic.<eos> Is this about Sofya or Rebekah?<eos> Klaus used to tell me that having power made you a target. Having allies made you vulnerable, so choose.
He always has been.<eos> Suppose everybody's celebrating Elijah's rescue?<eos> One big happy family?<eos> Something like that.<eos> You should be here, too, you know.<eos> Well, everybody got what they wanted.<eos> At least we have each other.<eos> Kol... I'm going to stay in New Orleans.<eos> At least until we see this through.<eos> Can I convince you to do the same?
Can I convince you to do the same?<eos> I don't think I can.<eos> I'm not in the mood for games, witch.<eos> What if I told you I could bring Davina back to life?<eos> For a price, of course.<eos> Davina!<eos> Davina.<eos> Kol.<eos> Some would go to the ends of the Earth to protect their love.<eos> You let her go - or I will rip you apart.
Here.<eos> Mmm, it's so good!<eos> Did I ever tell you the story of my first beignet?<eos> No?<eos> You are in for a treat. Long ago, three French nuns came to New Orleans looking for a fresh start.<eos> And they came here. They marched right into our courtyard, and they presented your Uncle Elijah and me with these rather lumpy-looking, sugar-coated pastries.<eos> Well, needless to say, we were entranced.<eos> We set them up quite well.<eos> Why did they come to you? Because there was a time when we were regarded as royalty.<eos> You might even go so far as to say I was king, which would make you a princess.
Here you are.<eos> Hiding inside the body of a vampire, because you're not as strong as you want me to think.<eos> You always had such spine.<eos> It's what I enjoyed most about you.<eos> And I know you enjoyed the power I had to offer.<eos> It's still here, Vincent.<eos> You can have it all back if you want. You just need to swear loyalty to me.<eos> The only thing that I want is for you to slither back into the rot that you came from.<eos> Do you want to fight me?<eos> Well, come on! I should send you back to join your dead wife.

But I have a better idea.<eos> An offer, for you and the Mikaelsons.<eos> You can hear me out... or die.<eos> You're not listening to me.<eos> All right, check again, and when you do find her, you keep your distance and call me.<eos> You can come on in, Klaus.<eos> To what do I owe the displeasure?<eos> I thought we had a truce.<eos> We do.<eos> If we didn't, I might've responded differently when Davina asked me to sacrifice you.
This is probably the one chance that you got.<eos> Now you want to blow that opportunity to maybe save your brother, or do you want to do you job and save your little girl?<eos> Don't use my daughter to justify your absurd plan.<eos> Hey, his "absurd" plan is the only plan that we've got. So maybe we should do a little less fighting, and a little more thinking.<eos> There's always a loophole.<eos> I have my mother's grimoires.<eos> I welcome you to study them with me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Shh. It won't be long.<eos> Even if you finish this, my family will bury you.
I welcome you to study them with me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Shh. It won't be long.<eos> Even if you finish this, my family will bury you.<eos> They will no doubt try.<eos> Though I believe the odds are in my favor.<eos> Once the ritual is completed, my spirit will return to New Orleans' soil.<eos> From it, I will be reborn far stronger than I have ever been.<eos> You are just another body for my brother to slay.<eos> You expect your brother to avenge you?
No! You will never...<eos> Hurt her?<eos> Why? Because your family will protect her?<eos> You poor soul.<eos> You can't even save each other.<eos> But your niece? She who's born of my bloodline?<eos> She has the power to destroy me, and that...<eos> I cannot allow.<eos> Mom?<eos> I didn't see you there, sweetie.
And if you do get the chance, don't hesitate, all right?<eos> Take this bitch down for good.<eos> Stainless steel laced with Hayley's blood.<eos> Now, you're gonna get one chance.<eos> Make sure you stab Sofya directly in the heart.<eos> I assure you, it's not gonna kill her. It's just gonna drop the Hollow's spirit out of her.<eos> Then I'll sacrifice Klaus and put the Hollow away for good.<eos> All right, I got it.<eos> You think you got it.<eos> This thing stole Elijah's blade, which means not only is it wearing your girlfriend's face, but it's got the weapon that can kill you.
You just bounce the ball, pick up the jacks.<eos> That's it.<eos> Okay, I'll try.<eos> Klaus... it's time.<eos> Really?<eos> Your girlfriend seems nice... for what it's worth.<eos> Kind of did it. Yep.<eos> Well, go on, your silence is deafening. Say it.<eos> Say what exactly?<eos> That my impending execution pleases you.
I should be making the deals. And what deal did you come to make, king of New Orleans?<eos> Are you here to bow and swear your undying loyalty?<eos> Yeah, well, we'll get to that, but first let's talk about my terms.<eos> All right, I want Sofya back.<eos> A reasonable request. After all, this body will soon be of no use to me.<eos> What do you have to offer in return?<eos> I got this from the Mikaelsons.<eos> And I'm willing to give it to you as an offering, in exchange for my friend.<eos> Then you have a deal. And you're a wise king.<eos> Perhaps when this is over, I will let you live.

Don't hesitate.<eos> Kill me now!<eos> Such small, frail things, these bones.<eos> They eluded me for so long.<eos> Now they will serve as the seeds for everything that is to come.<eos> Sounds like you got big plans.<eos> For your city?<eos> In fact, I do.<eos> And why not?<eos> I was of this land long before you existed.
Now they will serve as the seeds for everything that is to come.<eos> Sounds like you got big plans.<eos> For your city?<eos> In fact, I do.<eos> And why not?<eos> I was of this land long before you existed.<eos> Imagine spending nturies in the cold, longing to once again feel this soil, to breathe this air, to sweat in the heat of its sun.<eos> All that remains is the sacrifice.<eos> If you're so eager to die, be patient.<eos> Once the Hollow rises, she'll kill you herself.
Once the Hollow rises, she'll kill you herself.<eos> Man, you don't have to do this.<eos> I mean, we're all New Orleans witches here, right?<eos> You talk of witches as you make deals with vampires.<eos> It's 'cause of them that we need the Hollow.<eos> Please, man, she is never going to save you.<eos> She's just gonna damn you to hell.<eos> Okay, enough talk.<eos> Sofya, fight her.<eos> I will kill you.
He's somewhere inside, but...<eos> But what?<eos> His voice sounds distorted, broken, like radio static and I just heard... his screaming.<eos> Now just remember that her mind was invaded by the most powerful witch in all of history, so there's really no telling what she's going through right now.<eos> How you holding up?<eos> All right, look, is this why you stopped by?<eos> Grief counseling?<eos> No.<eos> I came to get my journal back.<eos> Wait, you made me promise to kill you if you ever asked for that thing back.
All right, look, is this why you stopped by?<eos> Grief counseling?<eos> No.<eos> I came to get my journal back.<eos> Wait, you made me promise to kill you if you ever asked for that thing back.<eos> Well, we weren't where we are now.<eos> The Hollow has us.<eos> It's stronger than we are, it's got more followers and it's gonna be reborn in the flesh.<eos> Now, we have no idea what it is that we're up against, because nothing like this has been around in a thousand years and if we don't get stronger, then we're done for.<eos> All right, this thing, it tempted you before.

No, I'm not.<eos> All right, Vincent, if this thing gets a hold of you...
You Mikaelsons, you always find a way to get right back on top, don't you?<eos> And I bet you got a plan all figured out. As a matter of fact, I do.<eos> A rather festive one, in fact.<eos> I'd love to tell you all about it.<eos> Well, if you're gonna help me fight this thing, you're gonna have to know what it is that you're up against.<eos> Come in before I change my mind.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> We were heading out, and now we're throwing a party, I see.<eos> One that will be attended by New Orleans' most influential supernatural denizens.<eos> You do realize that everyone hates you.
I mean, the list goes on and on and on and on and on, and sometimes it's hidden, but if you know what you're looking for...<eos> Right? There's always a sign that it's the Hollow.<eos> And when it does bubble up, it always does so in a pattern of four.<eos> What does it want? It's a ghost.<eos> It-it wants access to this world.<eos> So it reaches out, and it whispers to the desperate.<eos> There have to be others, someone else, someone who could speak to us of its desires, of its weaknesses.<eos> You think this person might be at your party? I'm counting on it.<eos> Mm.<eos> I'm counting on you to help me identify them.
It's such a shame these lovely linens will soon be red with blood.<eos> Violence must only be seen as a last resort, or it will only weaken our position.<eos> Yes, well, I'm a creature of very specific habits.<eos> Brother, please remember, the plan tonight is to create a false sense of security.<eos> A little music, a little champagne, some stealthy reconnaissance. No bloodshed.<eos> Do we understand each other?<eos> They threatened me, they threatened my child.<eos> Bloodshed is inevitable.<eos> And if Hope should ever find out?<eos> She worships you, Niklaus.
How about you and your fancy jacket and tie go straight to...<eos> What goes around... comes around.<eos> I think that fits.<eos> You ransacked my place. Classy.<eos> Well, to the victor goes the spoils.<eos> And now that you know I have it, you know I can use it at my leisure.<eos> Then use it. Or else go back to your stupid party. Excellent.<eos> You can hear our merriment above.<eos> Freya assured me that you would.<eos> She also assured me that her boundary spell would render you invisible to anyone outside our bloodline.
And now that you know I have it, you know I can use it at my leisure.<eos> Then use it. Or else go back to your stupid party. Excellent.<eos> You can hear our merriment above.<eos> Freya assured me that you would.<eos> She also assured me that her boundary spell would render you invisible to anyone outside our bloodline.<eos> If you think that waving that blade around is gonna scare me, you're more desperate than I thought.<eos> You misunderstand.<eos> This is not to scare you, it's merely to illuminate your conundrum.<eos> You see, there are those who care about you.<eos> Who would see you free.
Remember the deal we made.<eos> Well, you want first crack at our foe, be my guest.<eos> I spy a lady in need of accompaniment.<eos> Sofya Voronova, I presume.<eos> I'm so glad the lack of invitation didn't deter you from attending.<eos> I know Marcel, and he's throwing this little party, isn't he?<eos> Where might I find him, by the way?<eos> Oh, alas. He's been detained.<eos> Funny, he didn't come home last night either.<eos> Well, perhaps he's simply avoiding you.
Sit down.<eos> Let's start again.<eos> So what is it you like about him, then?<eos> His boundless confidence?<eos> His boyish charm?<eos> All of the above.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Am I supposed to be threatened by that monstrosity on your arm?<eos> You should be.<eos> Other than Marcel, it's the only thing on this planet that can kill you.

The Hollow will not be stopped.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we have here an errand boy of the Hollow.<eos> A disciple of the very darkness that threatens to devour our city, your loved ones... and mine.<eos> Now, whether or not you despise us, my family will do everything in its power... to remove this scourge from New Orleans.<eos> I recommend you do the same... or else.<eos> Where is he?<eos> You have quite the one-track mind.<eos> It's unexpectedly useful.<eos> I may just keep you around.
Big, happy family. Outdoor wedding feast.<eos> Ring any bells?<eos> I'd gone off to get more wine.<eos> I returned to see you feeding on my sister.<eos> The wedding party, my entire family... all dead.<eos> I hid and watched what you did.<eos> Well, I'm terribly sorry, of course.<eos> Still, I am glad I confiscated all your weapons, what with you being so hell-bent on revenge and all.<eos> Careful not to overplay your hand, Klaus.<eos> I've hated you a lot longer than I've known Marcel.
And you're quite welcome.<eos> Dominic wanted you dead.<eos> So, am I supposed to thank you?<eos> An alliance between you and I... is essential.<eos> This enemy's a dark force. It can't be bargained or reasoned with.<eos> I don't bargain. And I'm done with reason.<eos> What about you?<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> What...<eos> Elijah did... not exactly what I expected when I invited you to the party.
- Previously on The Originals...<eos> - So, tell me, exactly how much of this cursed rosebush is there?<eos> Enough to kill you and your whole family ten times over.
The Mikaelsons got one, the Hollow's got another.<eos> Which is why we're gonna check with every antique dealer, junk collector, and local historian until we control the final pieces.<eos> Now, if this vile spirit gets her hands on the bones first, she'll be impossible to kill.<eos> This is old magic.<eos> The covens can't stop it.<eos> But that is our city.<eos> We protect it, no matter what we got to do or who we got to kill.<eos> We've had five years of peace, and I intend to keep it that way, but I need your help.<eos> All right? Now get out there.<eos> I have been looking everywhere for you.

Now get out there.<eos> I have been looking everywhere for you.<eos> I'm flattered.<eos> But I had business to take care of.<eos> Klaus said you tried to rescue me.<eos> He also said your boy Dominic was an acolyte of the Hollow.<eos> I only made a deal with Dominic to try and save you.
You don't understand.<eos> You can't.<eos> Good thing we brought the German sports car.<eos> Says the man in the $5,000 suit.<eos> Nine... if we're counting.<eos> I'm not a barbarian.<eos> All right, look, your expert better pay off.<eos> Otherwise, we're wasting time that we don't have.<eos> See, that's so very hurtful, Marcellus, and here I thought we were having a marvelous galactic adventure together.<eos> You think you're real cute, don't you?
Just died on me.<eos> Yeah. Sorry.<eos> Some other guy called dibs.<eos> And he's a real jerk.<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> 'Cause I know something that you don't.<eos> And what's that?<eos> I packed that trunk full of C-4.<eos> If this thing is so powerful it can't be destroyed, why bring us here? Why tell us all of this?<eos> The Ancestors needed you to know.
That cemetery was redeployed. Too much flooding.<eos> Now the bodies were moved to two separate locales... The Haves and the Have Nots.<eos> Del Robles were aristocracy.<eos> Okay, it means their crypt was moved to St. Ailbhe Cemetery.<eos> Yeah, that sounds like fun, but on the way, can you drop me off at the ER?<eos> Thanks.<eos> What the hell is all this?<eos> This is what's needed if we want - to stop the Hollow.<eos> - What's needed - is Klaus.<eos> - No, Hayley, we only need you.
A curse upon all present that night.<eos> She bound them to the full moon, so that once a month they would turn into the very beasts they used to hunt her.<eos> The Hollow created the werewolf curse.<eos> You bear the mark of the Crescent.<eos> So did she.<eos> And her mother... Who, once cursed, became the first of the werewolves.<eos> The others fled, becoming the six other wolves you know today.<eos> But it was your line that began it all, and yours alone that still has power over the Hollow.<eos> That's why she's been hunting Labonairs.<eos> The Hollow fears you.
Not just yet.<eos> What have you done with Hayley?<eos> I sent her to save us all.<eos> Really?<eos> Or is this your idea of revenge? Holding me captive here?<eos> I don't care about revenge.<eos> I'm a New Orleans witch and I will protect my home.<eos> Not just for me, but for your daughter, too.<eos> - Then release me.<eos> - No. I need you here.
She'll burn the entire city.<eos> Davina, please.<eos> D. There's got to be another way.<eos> No.<eos> I was just waiting for the weapon, but now that you're here...<eos> I'm sorry. - But you need to kill him.<eos> - No, Davina.<eos> He's lived ten lifetimes, that's more than enough.<eos> He's Hope's father.<eos> She'll still have you.
And some of them are even things that don't want to hurt you.<eos> And what do you have there?<eos> These are for serenity. And this one is for stillness.<eos> They'll keep the flowers in bloom.<eos> Now, did you teach yourself all that?<eos> Well, I did read about it in one of my Aunt Freya's books.<eos> She's helping me learn, but some stuff I figured out on my own.<eos> Well... that is all very impressive.<eos> She's an impressive young lady.<eos> It's good meeting you, littlest Mikaelson.
Our two girls are thriving there.<eos> They are learning to use their powers for good... and to embrace their identities without fear.<eos> Hope would always be welcome there.<eos> Give my regards to Mystic Falls.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> You can't promise me a future and then offer yourself up to die.<eos> Survival demands sacrifice.<eos> There is always another way, Elijah.<eos> There wasn't time for another way.<eos> Well, Hope just got her family and she needs you.

Hope needs her father.<eos> I need you.<eos> I love you.<eos> But we've got to figure out a way to fight and win and still have something that I recognize as a good life.<eos> Rebekah asked me if there was somewhere I could go to be happy.<eos> Begin again.<eos> Manosque.<eos> It's this... beautiful village in the south of France, the... countryside.<eos> And when we end this... and we will end this...<eos> I'll take you there.

I will make this right.<eos> Then start by giving this to Marcel.<eos> D, I'm sorry.<eos> When I lost you, my world fell apart, and I went through all the stages.
We're... we're standing down.<eos> Is that what CERT advised?<eos> - CERT?<eos> - Correctional Emergency Response Team.<eos> Do you not have a CERT team on the scene?<eos> We're sort of between CERT teams right now.<eos> For fuck's sake!<eos> I'm sending a team over and I'm billing MCC up the ass.<eos> You listen to their assessment of casualty risk and you let them de-escalate this mess.<eos> I consider you a friend, Jack... but I can't believe how badly you shit the bed on this.
She stole me a ring off a corpse.<eos> How romantic.<eos> Illegal and creepy, but very romantic.<eos> She left me for a professional water-skier. She said she was the only woman who ever looked hot in a life vest.<eos> How do you fight that?<eos> I think we need more padding.<eos> Like a base layer.<eos> You know, like a...<eos> like a tarp or something.<eos> Whoa. I didn't even ask you to move in, Pipes.
You know, like a...<eos> like a tarp or something.<eos> Whoa. I didn't even ask you to move in, Pipes.<eos> That's, uh... that's pretty presumptuous.<eos> Alex Vause, may I put my prison-issue mattress next to your bulldozer scoopie thingy, and ride out a nightmare with you?<eos> You may.<eos> Will I not like you when you get very angry?<eos> I'm repurposing.<eos> Do you want me to help you rip off the other one?<eos> Is it driving you crazy?
I'm repurposing.<eos> Do you want me to help you rip off the other one?<eos> Is it driving you crazy?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> You know that I need symmetry!<eos> - It's hard to look at, huh?<eos> - Now you're just being a bully.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> This is a gift for you.
No.<eos> Yes.<eos> You know that I need symmetry!<eos> - It's hard to look at, huh?<eos> - Now you're just being a bully.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> This is a gift for you.<eos> It's no corpse ring, but it'll have to do.<eos> Daya!<eos> Hey, I've been looking for you.
Yes.<eos> And I disagree.<eos> I think Boo's giving tree actually does more takin' away than giving.<eos> - How so?<eos> - The tree's a sign of goodness.<eos> But when it gets filled with cement, the tree symbolizes what's been taken from Scout, her innocence.<eos> Plus, she's got that dumb name.<eos> Okay, permission slips, people!<eos> I need them before we get on the bus tomorrow.<eos> Uh, Janae, I'd like to speak with you.
Uh, Janae, I'd like to speak with you.<eos> Ooh. Watson getting called out.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> For what?<eos> - Here, I got my permission slip.<eos> - Ah, excellent.<eos> I want to make sure you're coming tomorrow.<eos> You excited?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I guess. - I'm excited for you.
Who's this?<eos> Oh, my God, Gloria?<eos> - What the fuck number's this?<eos> - I found a cell phone.<eos> You found a cell phone and you're calling me?<eos> Damn, woman.<eos> Ain't you got no real friends?<eos> We were only prison gay.<eos> Minus the gay part.<eos> Yeah, what can I say? I missed you.
Something like that.<eos> You all right, girl?<eos> You sound funny.<eos> Listen, I gotta tell you something.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I feel like I'm, you know, losing my mind in here.<eos> My grip on things.<eos> You gotta do you, girl.
- I'm sorry.<eos> - You gonna let me lead or not?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Keep telling me what you want me to do. I...<eos> I wanna do to you what the vibrating phone did.<eos> Seeing you get turned on, it was...<eos> It was so hot.<eos> I wanna turn you on.
Nothing. - Everything.<eos> Territory is off-limits.<eos> Then you ain't gettin' King.<eos> And... we're taking our stock public.<eos> Who wants to buy Judy King?<eos> - Selling to the highest bidder.<eos> - I do.<eos> Damn, JK!<eos> Lotta people hate you.<eos> Or want you, depending how you wanna look at it.
Nah. I just spoke to my girl in there.<eos> She didn't say shit about this.<eos> Maybe the riot hadn't started yet?<eos> Ain't you listening?<eos> It started yesterday.<eos> She was lying through her fucking teeth.<eos> Where is she?<eos> ...often affiliated with gangs and prone to violence.<eos> They have no intention of rejoining polite society.<eos> I feel like I'm seeing you naked... but it's your face.
And what I was thinking is, we'd... we...<eos> Need help, Desi?<eos> Finding the owner of the vag car?<eos> Your reading nook.<eos> - Huh. - What's "Oh, huh" about it?<eos> Well, I thought we talked about the reading nook being a bit more about reading and less about... clutter.<eos> I like having things around, Piper.<eos> It comforts me.<eos> I'm a collector.<eos> Why don't you go over there and sit on your dirty yoga mat and admire your... collections?

Let's go to your solo, second bridge.<eos> You need to give this a lot more soul here, honey.<eos> Channel your inner Aretha and let those "No's" rip.<eos> I know, right?<eos> So moving.<eos> Sing it, Effie!<eos> - Yo, you just hit 10,000 views!<eos> - No shit!<eos> Let me see this.<eos> All these comments are about you, though.
Who gives a shit what some Internet troll says?<eos> It's stupid.<eos> I'm gonna put it on airplane mode.<eos> "Hashtag, show your tits, Maritz."<eos> Like, where do they come up with this?<eos> Shut the fuck up, Stratman.<eos> What?<eos> I'm so sick of you babies.<eos> - ♪ Do, a deer, a female deer ♪<eos> - I hate you. - I hate you.
Ruiz, are you sure he put time on you?<eos> 'Course I'm sure!<eos> You... you had a hearing already?<eos> - Then it's not a done deal.<eos> And with the speed paperwork moves around Litchfield, I wouldn't be surprised if his recommendation is not even in your file yet.<eos> Have you seen your file?<eos> Piscatella, he's a... monster.<eos> He should never have been working here in the first place, and that's my fault.<eos> But you do not have to become the monster he's making you out to be.<eos> I've seen you with the other inmates.
- What the fuck!<eos> - Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> Shit. I'm sorry!<eos> It was...<eos> - Shut the fuck...<eos> - It was an accident.<eos> You shot my favorite finger,<eos> - you fucking asshole!<eos> - Go.<eos> - But I can't leave you.
And I doubt very, very much that you did that by yourself, that you did that in a vacuum.<eos> So... my memory's crystal clear.<eos> I was there.<eos> For all of it.<eos> In fact, the satisfying sound of your lover smacking the pavement is the only thing that gets me to sleep every night.<eos> Open the goddamn door!<eos> Excuse me, is there anybody here?<eos> Oh, yeah. Don't be shy, you know what to do.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> It's all for you, just gobble it up.
All righty.<eos> All right.<eos> So... it was built in '75.<eos> You got... 2,500 square feet, not to mention 350 feet of lake frontage.<eos> You got two sea docks.<eos> No way I can afford this.<eos> - Hey, Sam.<eos> - Hey, Buddy.<eos> Actually, it's under your budget.<eos> Yeah, I'd, uh, invite you in, but... - my old man's in a mood right now. - Huh.
I'm sorry I left yesterday.<eos> I know.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I made a friend.<eos> His name is Tuck.<eos> And he works at the Blue Cat Lodge.<eos> Nobody stays in the lodge or... eats in the restaurant or drinks at the bar.<eos> That's your kind of place, right, Dad?<eos> Go back to sleep, okay?<eos> I love you.

If I have to check it, for some reason, they do random screens of bags at intervals so someone could see into this bag on the other side.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hey, did I wake you?
On one of those little things... you tie around the handle.<eos> I'm expected in there today, John Lakeman.<eos> There's a bag with John Lakeman on it in there. Has 11 million Euros in it.<eos> Why would you fill out the little I.D. thing?<eos> Jeez, son.<eos> Yeah, well, sometimes I have to choose between bad alternatives.<eos> What if the airlines just lost it? Then you guys would be all pissed at me.<eos> We would be all pissed at you, yeah.<eos> Get it back.<eos> While you're in there today, conduct your interview like an ordinary industrial engineer, and get the bag and then this part is over.
They show up at work. It's safer.<eos> I found the book.<eos> Structural Dynamics of Flow.<eos> Where?<eos> The guy with the girl's name.<eos> - No shit?<eos> - No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Get it to Edward, John.<eos> I may want you out of there.
The guy with the girl's name.<eos> - No shit?<eos> - No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Get it to Edward, John.<eos> I may want you out of there.<eos> I may pull you out of there. Today. Before she comes.<eos> Cool.<eos> I'm gathering some information.<eos> I'll reach back out to you today.
I'm gathering some information.<eos> I'll reach back out to you today.<eos> Okay.<eos> She's good.<eos> She was cited this week for two instances of child neglect for leaving her daughter alone in her apartment.<eos> Her kid's seeing things.<eos> The neighbors narced.<eos> So... she's really cramming in the hours on your case.<eos> She's not a bad mom, I'm guessing; I'm guessing she's just a good cop.<eos> What does she have on you?

And I look at it, and I think even if I could get the TV off the chain, I couldn't steal it, because I have nowhere to take it because I have no home now.<eos> Hey, John.<eos> We got an e-mail.<eos> It was for you.<eos> It was from a foreign policewoman. She's gonna interview you tomorrow.<eos> Take care.<eos> Hey.<eos> Stay there.<eos> No matter what happens.<eos> I pull you out of there today, she shows up, John Lakeman's a ghost.
- How is that a screwdriver?<eos> - In a very broad sense.<eos> - How's it sonic?<eos> - It makes a noise.<eos> There they are!<eos> Spider!<eos> Come on!<eos> Kitty!<eos> Come look!<eos> They'll catch you and have you transported!
This is beyond unacceptable.<eos> This is naughty.<eos> - Language.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> "London, 1814."<eos> "Monster", "sea creature", "serpent",<eos> "really, really big fish".<eos> Nothing.<eos> Sir! You said you wouldn't be going off-world!<eos> Do these look like off-world clothes to you?
- We have to go to school.<eos> - Tag is the coolest person we know. - Absolutely.<eos> - That's a 60-foot wave.<eos> - I can't stop watching this.<eos> When he gets here, don't man-pressure him so hard, okay?<eos> Just be cool.<eos> - Because when you're uncool, I'm uncool.<eos> - What?<eos> Tag!<eos> It's good to see you, bro!
Can you scratch there?<eos> - Party Dog!<eos> - I was fucking with you guys.<eos> - I'm not sober. I drink.<eos> - You freaked me out!<eos> - I drink heavily.<eos> - I was like, "What a buzzkill!"<eos> Hey, I know it's hard to be alone at a wedding, so you can be my date tonight.<eos> I'm fine. In fact, I'm gonna give a toast tonight, that's how fine I am.<eos> Is that something Rich wants you to do?
It's not...<eos> - I'm sorry. My husband is sitting there.<eos> - Okay.<eos> It's so funny. They told us to sit here.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> Time to get served up. Time to get served up. What?<eos> - Hey. How's it going?<eos> - Good. How are you?<eos> I'm great.<eos> I'm so glad you're here, honestly.
- Good. How are you?<eos> I'm great.<eos> I'm so glad you're here, honestly.<eos> Where's Jen?<eos> She couldn't make it on account of the fact that we are divorced now.<eos> - Oh, wow.<eos> - Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> She wanted to come to this wedding and I fought to take custody of it because I was hoping you would be here.

If you wear a uniform, women wanna fuck you more.<eos> Come on, that's not really true.<eos> That's not really true, is it?<eos> 100% true.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> When the dog was a married dog, the dog just hung out with other married dogs.<eos> But now the dog's a single dog and the single dog has learned a lot about the single dog's life.<eos> One of the things I learned, and it's a fact, if you're in a uniform, women wanna fuck you more.<eos> - So you dress like a policeman.
It's not a uniform if you choose to wear it.<eos> Every college professor who dresses like that, it's not a uniform.<eos> That's just, like, lack of fashion imagination.<eos> - I don't know what the fuck that is.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Why do you all have elbow pads?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Are you all like this all day?<eos> So instead of a traditional speech, we decided to do something a little bit different.<eos> - This is for you, Ashley.

Let me just go right to the room.<eos> The room! Can we get a hand for the room, because it's beautiful.<eos> Is this spectacular or what out here?<eos> It kind of makes you wonder what Rich's third wedding is gonna look like.<eos> I'm gonna be a groomsman at that one!<eos> Rich, what can I say, Rich?<eos> That's your name... and it also is your most redeeming quality.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> I didn't see that coming!<eos> This beautiful woman, is she marrying you for your looks?
- You're acting like a baby.<eos> - I am?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Party Dog is acting like a...<eos> - No, Party Dog's a big dog.<eos> You're acting like a baby that could ride on my fucking back.<eos> - You hungry?<eos> - Am I hungry?<eos> - Do you need a nap? - No.<eos> Let me try to cheer you up a bit.
- Yeah.<eos> - Party Dog is acting like a...<eos> - No, Party Dog's a big dog.<eos> You're acting like a baby that could ride on my fucking back.<eos> - You hungry?<eos> - Am I hungry?<eos> - Do you need a nap? - No.<eos> Let me try to cheer you up a bit.<eos> Peek-a-boo! That's not funny.<eos> - I got you. I made you laugh there. - No.
What happened to Fun Ethan?<eos> Fun Ethan was abandoned by his friends and stranded with Howie and Anka and had to watch you throw yourself at your ex-boyfriend.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> I'm sorry, if you wanted to make me jealous, you did it. I'm jealous, okay?<eos> You're jealous?<eos> You have a fucked-up way of showing it!<eos> What?<eos> You never showed up at the hotel.<eos> It was a dick move.<eos> Especially after your whole "I really need you right now" sob story you gave me at the vineyard.
Especially after your whole "I really need you right now" sob story you gave me at the vineyard.<eos> Is that what this is all about?<eos> It was crazy with Lisa and the IVF.<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - You could have texted me.<eos> - You texted and said you weren't going!<eos> - Don't lie! You weren't coming.<eos> Whatever. I came here to have a good time and not to sit there and watch you just fawn over Dr. Horn Dog Party Dog.<eos> How do you think I feel?<eos> I watch you and Lisa all the time.
I think it's really dangerous to seek personal fulfillment through romantic relationships.<eos> I do.<eos> I'm just letting you know.

I'll get you some waters.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Awesome.<eos> - Totes presh.<eos> - Totes presh.<eos> - What?<eos> - Totes presh.<eos> So, uh...<eos> - have you been on Tinder long or... - All right.<eos> I'm gonna stop you right there because I'm not loving the whole vibe of this interaction so far.
After only two-and-a-half months of not dating.<eos> Three-and-a-half months, actually.<eos> But...<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Heather.<eos> I'm sure you are.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - You tell me. - Yeah. Um...<eos> We're gonna go eat outside.<eos> - But, um, nice to see you, Jess. Honestly.
He is nice.<eos> - You'll have fun.<eos> - I don't want to have fun.<eos> What do you want?<eos> - You ready?<eos> - Yeah, I'm ready.<eos> You're about to win the award for best playwright ever of all time.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't even know they made that award.<eos> Well, they just made it for you.
Like, deep, deep, deep Bushwick.<eos> What about you?<eos> I invented an app.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, well, thanks.<eos> This was interesting.<eos> In, like, an anthropological way.<eos> I'm gonna take that as a compliment.<eos> Yeah, I guess you could.<eos> Look, I don't want to disappoint you or anything, but...
- Yeah.<eos> That's awkward.<eos> I wouldn't say this is any more or less awkward than every other part of the night.<eos> That's funny.<eos> You're funny.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm also good at cunnilingus.<eos> Well, that's good to know.<eos> So, which way do you go now?<eos> "You can talk, but no one hears you."
- What?<eos> This is your one and only life.<eos> What do you want to tell people about it?<eos> Damon?<eos> - What the hell are you doing out here?<eos> - I've been thinking, all right?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah, I made a lot of mistakes.<eos> Damon.<eos> I should have never let you go.
Damon?<eos> - What the hell are you doing out here?<eos> - I've been thinking, all right?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah, I made a lot of mistakes.<eos> Damon.<eos> I should have never let you go.<eos> Damon, this is literally so crazy.<eos> Please come off the ledge.<eos> I can't. I won't go on without you.
Seriously.<eos> Hey, Ms. James?<eos> Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> I can't go to the writer's weekend.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Shandra, no, you're the only one who turned in your permission slip.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Is somebody coming to pick you up?
Yeah, okay.<eos> - He makes such pretty stuff, though.<eos> - Yeah, he's really, really good.<eos> Oh, wow, she posted a beautiful photo of a hamburger today.<eos> Yeah, she's really knows what to do with meat.<eos> That's a weird thing to say to me.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> You probably thought that...<eos> No, I meant she's good with dick.<eos> Tasha, are you sitting down?
All right, I don't have clever, witty ideas that I like to share with the world like everybody else.<eos> I just don't understand why you unfollowed me.<eos> Well, Damon, it's not like we're together anymore.<eos> So, what? That means we can't be friends on Facebook?<eos> No, I don't think we can.<eos> No. No, we cannot.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I don't get it, how one minute we can be in love, and the next minute we're less than strangers.<eos> What, you're asking me?<eos> Yes. I'm asking you.
No, I don't think we can.<eos> No. No, we cannot.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I don't get it, how one minute we can be in love, and the next minute we're less than strangers.<eos> What, you're asking me?<eos> Yes. I'm asking you.<eos> I don't know. I didn't think it'd be big of a deal.<eos> Really?<eos> You unfollowed me.<eos> I guess, secretly, I kind of hoped that you would notice, but I didn't want you to get all bent out of shape about it.
And I can tell because I just so happen to be a brain-eating zombie who loves kids' brains.<eos> Yes. I knew that.<eos> And I have something to tell you.<eos> I'm a zombie slayer.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> And we have a long feud going back... centuries, and centuries, and centuries.<eos> Yes, and for some reason, we always seem to run in circles which is why we've been feuding for so long.<eos> Yes, this is a cosmic dance between two people.<eos> Two people who don't know how to fight.<eos> But I came here today to tell you... that I love you.
That is a good porn.<eos> That's a good form of porn.<eos> Also, um, I was wondering what you were up to this weekend?<eos> You were, were you?<eos> Yes, I was, I was.<eos> I, um, I'm actually gonna be in Ohio for my little sister's baby shower.<eos> Oh, a lot of new information there.<eos> What, you're from Ohio?<eos> Yes. I am, unfortunately.<eos> It's weird I know more about your ex-boyfriend than I do you.
What?<eos> Why?<eos> We saw you out here circling around the block, it's...<eos> It's sad, man.<eos> I'm what...<eos> Well, you can tell Mandy that I happen to be on the phone, arranging a date with a girl, a woman, who is a wonderful playwright from Ohio.<eos> I didn't even know that I was in your neighborhood.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm not gonna tell her any of that.<eos> Fine. Don't tell her. I don't give a shit.<eos> You know, she still has a great deal of affection for you.
I'm sorry.<eos> What did you say your name was?<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> You all right?<eos> Your sister is so excited you are home. You don't even know.<eos> It's like all she can talk about. Yeah.<eos> Well, it's not every day we get a visit from our big city girl.<eos> Please do not call me "big city girl," Kenny.<eos> We missed you at Christmas.
- So...<eos> Tell us everything.<eos> How's your writing?<eos> How's Damon?<eos> It's good.<eos> Writing's good, Damon's good.<eos> It's all good.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yup.<eos> Oh, Jess, it's so good to see you.
- You're welcome.<eos> - All right.<eos> See you later.<eos> - Do you have heels, babe?<eos> - No.<eos> So, you're leaving next month?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> Wait, Jessica.<eos> Jessica, you remember Mrs. Taggart, don't you?
Thank you.<eos> Who belongs to this, huh?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'm really sorry.<eos> I think my whole life, I've been in love with love.<eos> But I've never really felt love.<eos> Until now, Dustin.<eos> You complete my everything.<eos> I love our love.<eos> I love you.
I think my whole life, I've been in love with love.<eos> But I've never really felt love.<eos> Until now, Dustin.<eos> You complete my everything.<eos> I love our love.<eos> I love you.<eos> Madison, I know.<eos> You made me see that the one could be anyone.<eos> As long as there's love.<eos> And having you by my side is what completes me.
I can honestly tell you this has been the best day of my whole life.<eos> When I look into your eyes, I can see forever.<eos> And I never want it to end.<eos> Madison, will you marry me?<eos> Yes, Dustin!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - Is this real?<eos> - It's so real.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I love you so much.
You get this.<eos> This is no risk.<eos> - Okay, all right. Okay.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay, that's good.<eos> - Nice, doesn't that feel good?<eos> - It's okay, so... Whoa.<eos> All right.<eos> I got you.
No, mine is called "Hi, Mom."<eos> - Have you heard about it?<eos> - No.<eos> Basically, we make it seem like you're staying in touch with your parents or whoever, without you having to stay in touch with your parents or whoever.<eos> That's insane.<eos> How do you do that?<eos> We study users' text feeds, and social media.<eos> And we generate a weekly personalized message in their own voice from their own cellphone number.<eos> A typical one would be, "Hi, Mom."<eos> I was just thinking about you.
- Thanks.<eos> Do you think I could get a hook up for like my mom and my sister?<eos> - How thoughtful of you.<eos> - Do you know a guy? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I, sort of, know a guy.<eos> How about you?<eos> Tell me about one of your plays.<eos> Nah, let's just change the subject.<eos> I don't...<eos> I thought theater was all you cared about.
I love reading it.<eos> I love watching it even when it's bad.<eos> I love teaching it.<eos> I especially love making it.<eos> I just...<eos> I love it all.<eos> That's great.<eos> So, what's the problem?<eos> I don't know if it loves me back and that scares the shit out of me.<eos> Come on. I'm sure it loves you back.
That's great.<eos> So, what's the problem?<eos> I don't know if it loves me back and that scares the shit out of me.<eos> Come on. I'm sure it loves you back.<eos> No, I have a wall full of rejection letters that beg to differ.<eos> - I would love to read one.<eos> - What?<eos> A rejection letter?<eos> No. I would love to read one of your plays.<eos> Maybe, I'll think about it and get back to you.
Yeah. I know.<eos> I already, uh, spent the night here, remember?<eos> - Yes. - Mm-hm.<eos> - I had such a great time today.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> It was really lovely.<eos> - You're such a beautiful skater.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I had a really terrible teacher.<eos> You're sure I don't still remind you of how not Damon I am?
I think we should slow it down a little bit.<eos> I spent the night here the first time we hung out.<eos> - Yes. - Mm-hm. - And it was tremendous.<eos> You booty called me like four days later.<eos> - So, so fun.<eos> - You're an excellent lover.<eos> Well, please don't call me lover.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> I probably seem to you, like I have my shit together.
We are so naked.<eos> You're so beautiful.<eos> I am.<eos> I'm a little nervous.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> You don't seem nervous at all.<eos> - I love the way you feel.<eos> - I like the way you feel me.<eos> - Yeah? - Mm-hm.<eos> How about if I feel you here?
It's fine.<eos> - Would you like me to call the police?<eos> - No, man.<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna call the police.<eos> Don't call the police, man.<eos> I love her, okay?<eos> I love her!<eos> Good luck.<eos> I love you.
Uh, hey.<eos> - Ms. James?<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> What are you doing over here?<eos> Where's your mom?<eos> Oh, she's waiting for me around the corner.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Well, my dad got your message.<eos> Can you just tell him I'm sorry about that?<eos> He told me to tell you that he's glad that you haven't been broken by life yet.
You know what?<eos> Forget it.<eos> Just do whatever you want, Shandra.<eos> Why should I care if you don't?<eos> I didn't say I didn't care.<eos> Obviously, you don't.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Wait.<eos> Are you mad at me?<eos> I'm not mad at you.
- Mm. You would like it.<eos> You should come.<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> And you know what?<eos> What?<eos> - Mature.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Jessica.<eos> What?<eos> I really like you.
Knock, knock.<eos> Hi.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to apologize.<eos> About what?<eos> I'm really, really sorry for making you feel bad about wanting to spend time with your dad.<eos> Do you mind if I sit down?<eos> Well, this is a really cool room.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I thought about you a lot this weekend.
- Thank you. - Oh!<eos> Uh, anyway, I got you something.<eos> Wait, are you kidding me?<eos> For me?<eos> - I should be getting you a present.<eos> - No, but...<eos> You know how I pretty much moved here to escape my family?<eos> Yes, you and everybody else who moved here.<eos> Well, I got more than I bargained for.<eos> I love you.
I wasn't too over the top?<eos> No, you were perfect.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I thought it was such a great character.<eos> Thank you so much for casting me.<eos> No, you...<eos> You were amazing.<eos> You're so good.<eos> Uh-oh. - What?<eos> - Don't look behind you. Don't, don't.
- Don't look behind you. Don't, don't.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Just keep cool.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You've got this.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I didn't know you were coming tonight.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, I know how much this means to you.
Yeah, well, you know, I know how much this means to you.<eos> That's...<eos> How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Good?<eos> I'm good, yeah.<eos> You?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Good.<eos> It's nice to see you.
How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Good?<eos> I'm good, yeah.<eos> You?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Good.<eos> It's nice to see you.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Mm-hm. Well, it's nice to see you, too.
- Yeah?<eos> - Mm-hm. Well, it's nice to see you, too.<eos> We should get tea sometime.<eos> Tea sounds great to me.<eos> You're a really good guy, Damon.<eos> I know?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> I'll call you.
We should get tea sometime.<eos> Tea sounds great to me.<eos> You're a really good guy, Damon.<eos> I know?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> I'll answer.<eos> Good to see you.
I'll answer.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> - See you.<eos> - See you.<eos> It seemed like a positive interaction.<eos> Did you know he was gonna be here?<eos> - I had no idea.<eos> It was a surprise.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I could have warned you. He posted it on Twitter three days ago.
Going twice...<eos> - Uh, I-It's me. - It's me.<eos> - It's me.<eos> - No, I raised my hand fist.<eos> - No, over here. - It's me.<eos> - It's me!<eos> - I don't belong here.<eos> Put your hands down.<eos> Alright, we'll do it that way.<eos> Don't worry, whoever you are, we'll find you.
That's it.<eos> Alright.<eos> Alright, lie down.<eos> Lie back.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Rest. That's it.<eos> It's alright.<eos> Nice fridge.<eos> Hey, Tule.<eos> Can I ask you a question?
- Nope.<eos> - Not me, exactly.<eos> Christ, I barely want that.<eos> I mean, the other part, you know, like, what I am.<eos> What, the... the vampire part?<eos> The not dying part.<eos> If you could have that, would you want it?<eos> Live forever, huh?<eos> I guess it'd be cool.<eos> You don't have to worry, 'cause nothin' hurts you, you know?
That's right.<eos> They've been scrubbed off.<eos> There's nothin' on this tape that can identify who's holding that gun.<eos> But I want to know who's holding that gun.<eos> Don't we know who's holding that gun?<eos> - You.<eos> - It's not me.<eos> Why would I bring it in here if it was me?<eos> To cover your ass.<eos> I thought you were worried about someone tracing this back to you.
Thanks, Eugene.<eos> What the heck?<eos> I'm... I'm sorry. I just thought that...<eos> You like me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait...<eos> You're not mad?<eos> Yes, I'm mad... mad that you didn't say anything.<eos> What?<eos> I like you too!
Eugene!<eos> I didn't know you were here!<eos> Preacher.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Tracy tells me you got a big chemistry test coming up this week.<eos> You gonna be ready?<eos> I...<eos> Yeah, I-I think so.<eos> Good.<eos> That goes for you too, Tracy.
I called your father!<eos> He's gonna be very upset with you!<eos> Finish the job.<eos> Eugene!<eos> Go on, Eugene.<eos> Finish the job.<eos> That's right.<eos> Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh, that's right.<eos> Come on.<eos> I told you I was gonna come for you, Eugene.
Let's get that out the way.<eos> Come on there. Hard to recuperate when you're inhaling the smell of your own sick.<eos> My God.<eos> Alright. Let me get that for you.<eos> Papa?<eos> Papa, please.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You had to see for yourself.<eos> You had to see.<eos> Once they find out you are the mistake, that is where they will put you.
It's just me.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Um, I'm just going 'round all the apartments and fixing up the holes.<eos> If you want.<eos> I-I thought you were my ex.<eos> Come... Come on in.<eos> God...<eos> I don't know why I'm praying when I know you're not there, but... if this is your plan for me,<eos> I'm asking for your help.<eos> I gave up a piece of my soul to find you.
Jesse... much bigger things are coming for you.
Wait. Phil.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Please, don't!<eos> Men in white.<eos> Drop it.<eos> Come here.<eos> First, you've got to answer some quest...<eos> Wait!<eos> This is nice.<eos> And they opened it just for you.
10-double zero!<eos> Officer down!<eos> What is it?<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Turn it down!<eos> I can't hear what you're...<eos> How dare you!<eos> Turn that music down!<eos> I can't hear you.
Your receptionist's gone home for the night.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Yeah. For the next 20 minutes, you're garbage.<eos> Who are you?<eos> We're the professionals.<eos> I see a mistake has been made.<eos> I wanted women.<eos> I will compensate you for your time, but I must show you the door.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We're gonna show you the door.
[Natalia] Day 59.<eos> Tropical Storm Ella.<eos> Lots of waves coming over.<eos> Uh, heavy wind.<eos> The wind has picked up again, and we were getting blown really far south.<eos> There's big swells.<eos> Um... We're on the edge of a tropical rainstorm, and there's a lot going on.<eos> Really windy out there.<eos> We're fighting against the wind and the current as well at the moment.<eos> Feel a little bit like you're getting hit by a bus, to be honest.
And I was like, "Okay!"<eos> And that was it.<eos> I'll be rowing to Samoa, and then Megan Dyos will take over from me and go to Cairns.<eos> It's just something so far from what I've ever done before or even thought possible.<eos> [Laura] Girls, thanks for making this happen.<eos> For finally being an amazing team.<eos> I'm so proud of all of you.<eos> And of Meg, who's not here.<eos> But cheers, and thanks for the first leg, Izzy.<eos> We've adored you, and we're going to miss you massively.
So, I just stay like this for a while and then it goes away.<eos> We're very much in the thick of the whole doldrums stuff going on at the moment, so, some really weird weather.<eos> So much torrential rain and squalls and dramatic skies, pan-flat oceans, incredible light reflected on the water.<eos> Just an ocean that I've never known before.<eos> [thunder rumbling]<eos> [Lizanne] It's day 34, and I'm still being seasick.<eos> I'm sick of being sick.<eos> I can't really keep food down. My energy levels are low.<eos> There's never a time on the boat where you miss a shift.<eos> There's never a time where you ask someone to sub in for you.
Time is flying.<eos> -Flying. We're going fast still. -[laughs nervously]<eos> We're not really sure what to do with this.<eos> -We keep waiting for it to disappear. -Yeah.<eos> Every time we get out on the oars, we think we'll be going slow again, but so far... we're still going quite fast.<eos> [Natalia] We're traveling at like an amazing speed and in the right direction, which is just unheard of.<eos> We've done seven miles in the last two hours.<eos> That's definitely the most miles that has been done on Doris.<eos> We are less than 350 miles away from Vanuatu, which will be pretty much halfway, which is quite exciting.<eos> [Meg] Waking up every two hours at night, literally it feels like you've been hit by a sledgehammer and you just-- You don't have any choice.
And I don't know how we're still doing what we're doing every day, every shift, but we are.<eos> [bell rings]<eos> [Laura] Friends and family and stuff are all at home celebrating Christmas and, um, yeah, I just don't feel very Christmasy even though we've got decorations up and we're listening to Christmas carols and stuff and...<eos> Um, yeah, I just found it quite difficult, really, being away.<eos> Didn't realize how difficult I'd find it.<eos> Hi, Auntie Mary.<eos> How are you?<eos> Happy Christmas!<eos> Mom, the signal's not very good.<eos> I can't hear you very well.
Um, yeah, I just found it quite difficult, really, being away.<eos> Didn't realize how difficult I'd find it.<eos> Hi, Auntie Mary.<eos> How are you?<eos> Happy Christmas!<eos> Mom, the signal's not very good.<eos> I can't hear you very well.<eos> Oh, for fuck's sake.<eos> The signal isn't very good.<eos> I can't hear you.
I feel like it's given me massive purpose.<eos> I don't know what it is yet,<eos> I really don't, but that doesn't scare me.<eos> It's been nine months.<eos> Nine months since we left San Francisco and we rowed our little Doris under the Golden Gate Bridge, not really knowing what we were letting ourselves in for.<eos> I don't think I ever found it as my happy place again, but when I think back to being on the boat, I'm going to remember the waves and the skies and the stars and not the struggles.<eos> The moments that are gonna stay with me are all gonna be positive ones.<eos> [Tony] I'm going to drop the rope off, you pull it in.<eos> Part of history!<eos> Couldn't have done it without you!
' whatever it is you did and however it is you did it.<eos> Do you want to have sex?<eos> 'When posed by you, the answer to that question is always yes.'<eos> I want to start a charity for wounded vets, help them get their lives back on track.<eos> Mum's been filling me in on everything you've been doing, all your charity work.<eos> She thought maybe I should take it over.<eos> We can't even take a picture together because you're afraid it might get out.<eos> Do you mind taking a picture of us, Sparrow?<eos> I know you have history with Robert, but you have a future with me.<eos> I want you.

You haven't talked to any of the young ladies I invited here this evening.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> I'll go get us a drink.<eos> I know it's not exactly romantic, but we need to think of your future beyond the Privy Council.<eos> I understand, but formal lists are for leaders who don't know what they want.<eos> That's what your father said.<eos> And then I happened to be on his list.<eos> And look how that turned out.<eos> Sorry. That was unfair.<eos> I get it that we all have to make sacrifices for the family, but that doesn't exclude you.
Oh, come on.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I want to kick his ass.<eos> That's the spirit!<eos> - Now, take off your shirt.<eos> I can't believe I won.<eos> I had a feeling that luck might be on your side.<eos> If I can't arrange a charity auction, I don't deserve to be king of anywhere.<eos> You said you'd never tasted one!<eos> I would have said anything to meet you.
I appreciate that, but there wasn't a single person here this weekend.<eos> Wonderful to meet you, Your Highness.<eos> It was genuinely great to meet you, Rosie.<eos> Dame Sinnamon.<eos> Back to yourself, I see.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That outfit was dreadful.<eos> And that make-up.<eos> So I think my services call for a little title bump.<eos> I hereby deem you Baroness...

- You stayed.<eos> - So, what did you think?<eos> - A little intense, wasn't it?<eos> Well, he had it coming with all the showboating.<eos> Yeah, I guess he did.<eos> Hey. I know that you started this charity.<eos> It's gonna do a lot of good.<eos> You should be proud.<eos> That means a lot coming from you.<eos> It's good to see you, Kathryn.
Hey. I know that you started this charity.<eos> It's gonna do a lot of good.<eos> You should be proud.<eos> That means a lot coming from you.<eos> It's good to see you, Kathryn.<eos> Good fight, big brother.<eos> I just got a few more lucky shots in.<eos> Yeah, we gave 'em a good show.<eos> What?<eos> Cyrus bet on you.
It's good to see you, Kathryn.<eos> Good fight, big brother.<eos> I just got a few more lucky shots in.<eos> Yeah, we gave 'em a good show.<eos> What?<eos> Cyrus bet on you.<eos> He doubled his donation.<eos> It was a show for charity.<eos> Did you think you actually beat me, little brother?<eos> I did beat you.
It was a show for charity.<eos> Did you think you actually beat me, little brother?<eos> I did beat you.<eos> If you have to tell yourself that, go right ahead.<eos> You want to find out?<eos> Take a shot.<eos> I'll give you first swing.<eos> Liam, stop.<eos> You said you didn't want to play the fool.<eos> I know you'll keep getting back up. That's what you do. But I will keep putting you back down, and I don't want to do that.

Looks like the spam escaped your socks.<eos> Wait, you can make that kinda money from home?<eos> So I'm asking you to poke your head in.<eos> See who's takin' charge.<eos> It's just a meeting.<eos> I'm sure it'll be civilized.<eos> Well, that does not seem very PC.<eos> Or is it allowed if you're darker than a Band-Aid?<eos> I'm not ready to be around people yet.<eos> And maybe that includes you.
Well, that does not seem very PC.<eos> Or is it allowed if you're darker than a Band-Aid?<eos> I'm not ready to be around people yet.<eos> And maybe that includes you.<eos> You should go.<eos> I'm not in uniform.<eos> And you're nice and anonymous.<eos> Anonymous?<eos> There are, like, four Asian girls in this prison and my girlfriend just died.<eos> Oh, so let them comfort you, then.
And I intend to keep this one-percent neck.<eos> I had it contoured last January after Colicchio told me that it had more rings than a Swiss roll.<eos> But I told him he looked like a manscaped scrotum, which is less poetic, but extremely apt.<eos> You're scared.<eos> That's a new shade from you.<eos> - "Darker than a Band-Aid."<eos> - Oh, darling...<eos> - I have been terrified this whole time.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> You have had this place wrapped around your finger, but now you just lost your protectors.
No, you gotta look past the hair, man.<eos> I mean, imagine the big one with Sankey's hair.<eos> So you glue her scalp onto her head, you got a Pamela fucking Anderson.<eos> Pamela who?<eos> What, really? Who did you wank to, growing up?<eos> We, uh, weren't allowed.<eos> Yeah, no one's allowed, man.<eos> Hey, you suck.<eos> You and your stupid blue shirt.<eos> She's talking about you.
Pamela who?<eos> What, really? Who did you wank to, growing up?<eos> We, uh, weren't allowed.<eos> Yeah, no one's allowed, man.<eos> Hey, you suck.<eos> You and your stupid blue shirt.<eos> She's talking about you.<eos> Uh, what're you doing?<eos> Haven't you heard of negging? It's a seduction technique.<eos> Hey, I fuckin' hate you.
Orion.<eos> Daddy, this is little-girl stuff.<eos> And you're my little girl.<eos> Name the stars in his belt.<eos> Alnitak, Alnilam, Mintaka.<eos> Okay, wise guy.<eos> What do you do if it's a cloudy night?<eos> Hope for the best?<eos> Sometimes, knowledge can be dangerous.<eos> When you know the right word for something, it can make you overconfident, dull your senses.
You're gonna freeze in that getup.<eos> I'm not cold.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You sure are cleaning' up there.<eos> I'm only missing two.<eos> Ice Skating and Troop Dramatics.<eos> When you really know something... you don't need a badge for it.<eos> - What the hell is this?<eos> - Desi!<eos> They didn't get you.
You gotta get a cage, and you gotta get rats...<eos> Sometimes it's best to just use whatever's available on hand.<eos> Come on!<eos> Open the door, Flores.<eos> Yeah. I prefer not.<eos> How'd you like ten more years in prison?<eos> I don't mind it so much now that we running the place.<eos> Go to the chapel.<eos> Tell Maria the Jolly Gay Giant is back.<eos> When I get in there, I'm going to personally take you apart, Piscatella style.
I ain't going nowhere until this bitch gets what she deserves.<eos> In America, everyone has the right to a fair trial.<eos> Unless you brown!<eos> -Or poor!<eos> -Or famous!<eos> Or a white Christian!<eos> All right, all right.<eos> I'm just gonna have a quick habeas corpus, quid pro quo with my client.<eos> No go.<eos> Look, 2007 Britney Spears on steroids... you best step out of my way so I can talk to my friend.
Got any family out there?<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Hey, guys. So... it took me one whole minute to look this cute.<eos> It only took me 30 seconds to get so pretty for you.<eos> Rude.<eos> What?<eos> I'm two years younger than you.<eos> My mom always said shit starts to fall at, like, 29.<eos> How come no one ever told me this before?<eos> I don't know. Maybe they were protecting you.
Oh, shit!<eos> Thanks for the help, guys.<eos> Really appreciate it.<eos> Some of us are smart enough not to go near a unmarked box.<eos> I mean, that could be anything.<eos> It could be a bomb.<eos> Anthrax.<eos> Itty-bitty soldiers.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> One for you...
You sound like a old lady.<eos> Man, I am a old lady, as of today.<eos> And it's my TV time. I asked. So--<eos> Nobody else likes the shit you watch.<eos> It ain't fair.<eos> What the hell are y'all doing?<eos> Dante, no TV for the next week.<eos> Fucking bullshit!<eos> I hate it here.<eos> Don't like you much neither.
Have a seat.<eos> Ain't gotta sit, 'cause I already know, Ms. Tendler.<eos> Now that I'm 18, I gotta start figuring out where I'm gonna live at.<eos> Now, I know I only got a year to figure it out, but... I got a job and I got some friends.<eos> So, I think I'll be all right.<eos> Right?<eos> Sit down, Taystee.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> You got me a card?<eos> Your birth mother reached out, but we couldn't tell you till you turned 18.
- No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> That's a mistake.<eos> You can't let me go.<eos> I'm a danger to society, sir.<eos> Be that as it may, we can't keep you.<eos> No charges have been filed. Let...<eos> let's go.<eos> Frank, Janie called.<eos> She'll be over to get you after she drops the kids at soccer.
To laying low.<eos> To Drake's fine ass.<eos> - I'll drink to that. - Mmm.<eos> Look at Neri!<eos> She's showing.<eos> -You're texting with Cal?<eos> -What else am I gonna do?<eos> It's not like I'm busy with any important riot duties.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Sitting this out must be so hard for you.
-You're begging me?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> - You know I'm a doctor, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> -You serious? -Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm really serious.<eos> Look after your patient.<eos> Your tits feel amazing.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I missed you so much.
- Yeah.<eos> -You serious? -Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm really serious.<eos> Look after your patient.<eos> Your tits feel amazing.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I missed you so much.<eos> What happens in a riot, stays in a riot?<eos> Hand me that jug of oil, would you?<eos> You ain't greasing up like the rest of those beach bums outside, are you?
I haven't had a tan since '62.<eos> We're not gonna last long at this rate.<eos> The human body can sustain itself for up to three weeks without food.<eos> Myself, I've gone as long as eight days.<eos> Ran into some unexpected weather in Virginia on the trail.<eos> You start hallucinating eventually... but that could be fun, if you do it right.<eos> That sounds like the kind of vacation I need right about now.<eos> Get out my head.<eos> Can I do that without the starving and being outdoors?<eos> You find the dope that's right for you.
I sound like one of them bad TV movies on the white lady channel.<eos> -Lifetime.<eos> -What?<eos> Channel where all those white ladies be cryin'.<eos> It's Lifetime.<eos> Ain't that also where them crazy parents be dressing up their kids like the... the dolls you put on top of the toilet paper?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Toddlers and Tiaras.<eos> - Yeah. - That's my favorite!<eos> I spent so many hours thinkin' about what you'd look like... who you grew to be and... what makes you laugh.
All right, baby.<eos> I'll see you at home.<eos> Bye, Mommy!<eos> Bye, other lady!<eos> They don't know about me.<eos> They will.<eos> I promise.<eos> It's just, I wasn't...<eos> You know, nobody teaches you how to be doin' these things.<eos> And I wanted to meet you first. And reconnect.
And what happens when the whole house goes up in flames, we're left with nothing, or, God forbid, you get a shock and cook yourself from the inside out--<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> You're gonna stress out the muffin.<eos> - You're right.<eos> - Babe...<eos> So, what you been up to, man?<eos> Wanting to die, mostly.<eos> Oh, careful there.<eos> Your mom can't hear you usin' the D word, understand?<eos> Don't want you bouncin' around a rubber room.
- There she goes.<eos> I'm done sitting out there and sunbathing.<eos> I mean, we've all done the hard part.<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> All we gotta do is wait 'em out.<eos> We owe this to ourselves.<eos> That's right.<eos> How can I help?<eos> You can collect.<eos> But people ain't gonna like you.
Why can't I come?<eos> It's just not a good time for us.<eos> Us.<eos> -Right.<eos> -Uh, look.<eos> I want you to take this.<eos> It's not much, but I want to help you.<eos> Did you tell them... about me?<eos> Guess this is you doin' right, huh?<eos> What's right for you!
I... I know.<eos> And that is why I've been so horny.<eos> Why are you laughing? No.<eos> No, no, no. I'm... I'm...<eos> This is not funny.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Oh, yes. I know you're serious. I know, baby.<eos> And that is the problem.<eos> Because you are also bat-shit crazy.<eos> I didn't mean to lead you on, honey.
No, no, no. I'm... I'm...<eos> This is not funny.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Oh, yes. I know you're serious. I know, baby.<eos> And that is the problem.<eos> Because you are also bat-shit crazy.<eos> I didn't mean to lead you on, honey.<eos> It's the hormones.<eos> The hormones, they made me do it with you.<eos> I love you so much, Lorna.
I bet that's what they tell the cows right before they send them down the chute.<eos> This could work.<eos> This is amazing, Frieda!<eos> I got dibs on shuffleboard.<eos> Does this thing have Frogger?<eos> Watch out for the cords there.<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> Aren't you tired of asking me that question?<eos> 'Cause I sure as shit am tired of answering it.<eos> Yeah. Well, they're gonna crucify you.
Peach, lavender, rose petal.<eos> Yes, please!"<eos> 'Sup, Amanda?<eos> Mackenzie.<eos> - When'd you get in?<eos> - Yesterday.<eos> Well, you've got good taste in books, so you're all right with me.<eos> -Taystee.<eos> -Poussey.<eos> Your mama did not name you Pussy.
We want to be motherfuckin' taken serious!<eos> -Hell, yeah!<eos> -That's right!<eos> Bye, Nita!<eos> Bye, girl! Bye!<eos> All right. Back up.<eos> Back up!<eos> Shit!<eos> Burn, bitch, burn!<eos> Fuck you, Piscatella! Yeah!
- All right.<eos> And still no response from the governor after inmates at Litchfield Prison publicly burned food and other supplies sent to them from the governor's office.<eos> Man. Two hours of this shit. It's like watchin' that Yule log channel at Christmas, only taco flavored.<eos> Looks like the log I made this morning.<eos> Too real.<eos> Bet they never thought we'd last this long.<eos> I love being underestimated.<eos> Like when no one thought I'd jump off the river bridge.<eos> Did a fuckin' backflip!<eos> Fuck you, Brent Moxley, and your stupid cousins, too.
Your mama, too.<eos> Yeah, thank you, Grace.<eos> You are the best sister ever.<eos> Thank you, but my name's Tiffany.<eos> Suzanne, hair is not for eating!<eos> It's for keeping your brain warm!<eos> Are you a child?<eos> You're smarter than that.<eos> You should know better than to eat your hair. Hair is not for that.<eos> That's supposed to be like a blanket on your brain to keep you cozy, warm, and protected.
It turned out he had that selfless love.<eos> I did have a snake once.<eos> A Burmese python named Krueger.<eos> Technically, it was Cal's, but Krueger liked me best.<eos> - Did you ever talk to it? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> When I was feeding him.<eos> Epic conversations. Mostly about the merits of frozen versus fresh mice and why Mike Powell never loved me back.<eos> You cold-blooded for sure.<eos> Nobody asked you, Hufflepuff.<eos> White girl hitting you with some mad expelliarmus!
She needs somethin'.<eos> What she needs is her old routine back.<eos> Yeah. Well... - we ain't in Kansas no more.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Yeah, all right.<eos> But if she start yelling "cunt," I'm callin' me a Catholic.<eos> - So you're looking for painters?<eos> - Not exclusively.<eos> It's really whatever inspires you.
- Don't be a dick.<eos> - No, seriously.<eos> We got to make this place nice and fix it up.<eos> Like you said, it's depressing.<eos> Get your crayons.<eos> I've always been more of a girth gal, myself.<eos> Don't like them long jobbies that poke your cervix.<eos> Amen to that.<eos> Ain't nothin' like a Fat Albert.<eos> Those fatties stretch you out.
There was this one guy I dated. He had a foot thing.<eos> Like high heels and all of that?<eos> No.<eos> Foot jobs.<eos> Like hand jobs, but with your feet.<eos> Whoa. How does that even work?<eos> Imagine picking up a hot dog... - Whoa. - ... with your toes, and then massaging it with your arches.<eos> It gave me calves like a speed skater.<eos> Lorna?<eos> I can't believe I'm lookin' at you.
"Hispanic" refers to people from Spanish-speaking countries, which includes the Spanish, who colonized Latin America, creating Latinos.<eos> Oh, for serious?<eos> Oh, that's mad interesting.<eos> Have you thought about expanding your menu?<eos> You know, like, lattes and stuff.<eos> Flat whites, cortados, breves?<eos> Listen to Chock Full O' Fancy Nuts over here.<eos> I was on the cover of Barista Magazine twice before the FBI figured out I was poisoning Jews and mud people.<eos> Oh, snap.<eos> Yo, I know you.
Come on.<eos> This was a lot of work.<eos> Look, I wouldn't be threatening to destroy it if I didn't think it was great.<eos> - Six orange, going once... - No!<eos> Fine!<eos> Pleasure doin' business with you.<eos> - You really shouldn't have.<eos> - Oh, of course I should have.<eos> - Oh. - Well...<eos> - Thank you.
You told me to blend.<eos> I'm blending.<eos> Fucking the prison's lead stud isn't what I meant.<eos> Well, we're not fucking.<eos> We've agreed to take things slow.<eos> And what about your other beau?<eos> The one who's in the guard bubble, probably being sodomized right about now?<eos> Listen, I told your blonde friend that Joe and I are over.<eos> Wait. You don't think they're really doing sodomy, do you?<eos> What do you care? You've got your new crush to worry about.

You don't think they're really doing sodomy, do you?<eos> What do you care? You've got your new crush to worry about.<eos> Listen, I'm just trying to keep my head above water, okay?<eos> When's this all gonna be over, anyway?<eos> Once she realizes you're not gonna put out.<eos> ...aromatherapy, and Shih Tzu.<eos> Is this one bothering' you?
You go out there, the pigs are gonna throw you in Max faster than you can say,<eos> "Please don't throw me in Max."<eos> Well, I have to talk to him.<eos> I have some very important news to share.<eos> Don't he text?<eos> I'm not gonna text my husband I'm pregnant, okay?<eos> You happy now?<eos> Yeah, that's not a good text.<eos> Or is it?<eos> I don't know you.
We gotta take matters into our own hands.<eos> Okay, but can you use your good hand?<eos> Because the other one looks like a tampon. I'm gonna gag and die.<eos> That's quite a talent you got there.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Normally, street art, it scares me, but this is very pretty.<eos> I wasn't goin' for pretty.<eos> Well, I... I like how it tells a story.<eos> How love gives you legs to stand on, and without it, you're just a disgusting, deformed cripple.<eos> Can I help you with something?
It's a surrender.<eos> Oh, shoot.<eos> There are words on it.<eos> - "Lasagna in the oven"?<eos> - Vinnie!<eos> - Jesus, is that a threat?<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> Honey, do you get it?<eos> It's our hilarious joke!<eos> I don't think he can hear you.
It's our hilarious joke!<eos> I don't think he can hear you.<eos> That woman looks mentally ill.<eos> - Jesus fucking Christ.<eos> - Your wife, I take it?<eos> No.<eos> Wrong prison.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - I love you!
- I sure as hell didn't take it.<eos> - Never trust a white bitch.<eos> Who you callin' a bitch, spic?<eos> Who you calling a spic, cracker?<eos> - They ain't got no coffee!<eos> - What?<eos> Who was that?<eos> Nobody.<eos> What?<eos> Lourdes, I can't hear you.
Nice legs.<eos> I see they've looted all the razors from commissary.<eos> Nah, I shaved this morning.<eos> This just my afternoon shadow.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> I think it's a really bad idea.<eos> I meant the hair.<eos> Oh, Bill, come on, don't be such a wet rag.<eos> Can't we just enjoy the fact that I'm back?<eos> I missed you.
Come here.<eos> You know how pissed the cops are gonna be when they see you on television before you've given them a statement?<eos> Honey, the only point of giving an exclusive is so you can tell your story to a worldwide audience before you tell it to anybody else.<eos> Don't think that's how the law works.<eos> - We're ready for you, Ms. King.<eos> - Ah! Finally!<eos> All right, time to bathe in a little limelight.<eos> Wash off the stink of that terrible place.<eos> Meredith... darling!<eos> Judy, it is so good to see you.
- What'd you do?<eos> - I didn't fucking touch her.<eos> My shot-off finger started to hurt the second she got close to it.<eos> Oh, like ghost pains?<eos> Tell her to stay away from me.<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to leave while Leanne uses the shower.<eos> Well, I wasn't planning' on pissing' in the shower today, so.<eos> You're not listening to me.<eos> This is a Penn-free zone now.<eos> Means you gotta stay 300 feet away from Leanne at all times.
No, no.<eos> Ms. Diaz is right.<eos> Those private prisons are awful.<eos> Uh, the food, guards always frisking us up...<eos> Oh, please, ain't no guard ever touched you.<eos> 'Cept for that doughy one that smelled like weed.<eos> But you liked that, didn't you?<eos> - Well, I would never...<eos> - Oh, please!<eos> Don't act like you ain't busy giving up that wrinkled piece of ass every chance you got.
Somehow find grace in it.<eos> Come on.<eos> The bodega was out of the wing ones, so I got you the extra-long.<eos> That guy that works there, what's his name?<eos> - Paolo?<eos> - He asked about you.<eos> That's not embarrassing at all.<eos> - Why? You like him or something?<eos> - No.<eos> 'Cause I think he got a little crush on you.
No.<eos> Just get me the fuck out of here!<eos> My nose!<eos> - Go.<eos> Piss elsewhere.<eos> Move.<eos> Get me... - the fuck out of here! - Hmm.<eos> Back the fuck away.<eos> You back away, you hall-pissing, guard-loving, finger-shooting hillbilly.<eos> Didn't your mommy potty train you?
Okay.<eos> No, not you!<eos> Flores is right.<eos> There's no stopping him.<eos> He'll burn this place to the ground.<eos> Relax. Right?<eos> Concrete don't burn.<eos> Lorna's taking care of it, all right?<eos> You're okay.<eos> You know, you just feel like this 'cause it's Suicide Sunday.
You're okay.<eos> You know, you just feel like this 'cause it's Suicide Sunday.<eos> It's Sunday?<eos> My God.<eos> How long has this riot lasted?<eos> Suicide Sunday.<eos> Not real Sunday.<eos> That's when you've been high for too long.<eos> Friday, Saturday, life's just a, uh, rush of possibility, you know?<eos> Maybe you even feel like you're not such a worthless piece of shit for a minute.
Suicide Sunday.<eos> Not real Sunday.<eos> That's when you've been high for too long.<eos> Friday, Saturday, life's just a, uh, rush of possibility, you know?<eos> Maybe you even feel like you're not such a worthless piece of shit for a minute.<eos> And then Sunday comes along.<eos> And your heart is like a jackhammer on your brain and you realize that none of it was real.<eos> And you want to claw your eyes out.<eos> This is just, uh, part of the ride.<eos> Is this what it's like for you, Nicky?
You got to stop being a manatee, Daya.<eos> Just floating around, watching the world go by you with your big eyes, waiting for the boat to ram its propeller into your head!<eos> You got to be the shark.<eos> No, you're the shark, Ma.<eos> But that don't mean I'm the fucking manatee.<eos> What up?<eos> Knew you had that boricua in you somewhere.<eos> Yo, Claire, wait up.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Daya, I've known you since the first grade.
What up?<eos> Knew you had that boricua in you somewhere.<eos> Yo, Claire, wait up.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Daya, I've known you since the first grade.<eos> If something was gonna happen between us, it would've happened by now. Don't you think?<eos> I'm into Claire. I thought you knew that.<eos> I like Diaz and all, but we can't all go down for what she did.<eos> You can't pull the lever.<eos> You got to let fate take its course, or it comes back to haunt you.
We could zip-tie him to the bed and do a mustache rodeo.<eos> Or prop his dick up with some popsicle sticks and duct tape.<eos> Okay, um... so according to my Italian, they're either going to ride my horse or eat ice cream on me.<eos> I'm wagering that you're the ice cream in this scenario.<eos> What if we put something up his ass?<eos> You know if you tickle his prostate right, you get a rise out of him.<eos> - Mmm. - Or we make him watch porn.<eos> What kind of porn you like?<eos> What?<eos> Doesn't look good for you, man.

Oh...
What happened to your friend, huh? The one that looks like Sloth from Goonies?<eos> No, I hate sloths!<eos> They only urinate and defecate once a week, and they have to do it in the same place every time.<eos> Huge Darwinian disadvantage.<eos> Oh, please. I could go with you.<eos> I'll be good. - See?<eos> Look, I'll be good.<eos> - Fuck, dude. God damn!<eos> Got a cousin like this, man.<eos> She's all fun and loopy, until she stab you in the thigh with your eighth grade karate trophy.
Whatever.<eos> There isn't a single thing you don't ruin, is there?<eos> It ain't about the fish.<eos> What is it?<eos> You can tell me.<eos> Claire won't talk to me.<eos> Paolo's too embarrassed to even look at me.<eos> And I had to pretend I got detention during lunch 'cause I didn't have no one to sit with.<eos> That's it?<eos> Shit. I thought that pervert PE teacher with the glasses touched you again.

Leave me alone.
I know, I know, Red.<eos> I'm no Macaulay Culkin.<eos> If at first you don't succeed...<eos> Maybe you should get used to failure.
Come on.<eos> Here, have a little drink.<eos> Now, you should probably expect some, uh, primo headaches, a little bit of short-term memory loss, even a soupçon of hellish hallucinations.<eos> Let's try and sleep through some of that?<eos> Oh, I feel like my hot flashes are having hot flashes.<eos> That, too.<eos> I'm gonna make you a cold compress, because I am all in on this whole role-reversal thing we got going here, okay?<eos> Every parent becomes the child sooner or later.<eos> But I didn't think it would happen so soon.<eos> It was for you, Nicky, and for my girls.
-A party. Tonight.<eos> He invited me.<eos> -And he said I could bring friends.<eos> -I don't like parties.<eos> Soggy herring and accordion music.<eos> Nervous men asking you to dance.<eos> Oh, Galina, you have been going to the wrong parties.<eos> - You waited. - We're not waiting.<eos> We're just sitting.<eos> Galina... I want to take you to the Georgian restaurant tonight.
I'mma go pee.<eos> Bam!<eos> Irkutsk is mine.<eos> The fuck is Irkutsk, anyway?<eos> All right, excuse me.<eos> Coming through.<eos> Tryin' to live my best self, here.<eos> Is that you, hot girl?<eos> Look, hey, man, I'm really sorry I don't remember your, you know, exact name after we did the sex and all.<eos> I just want you to know that, uh... that does not mean I don't hold you in a very high...
That Dayanara saved us.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I don't feel saved.<eos> -Well, we're still negotiating.<eos> -So the end justified the means.<eos> Look, I know how I am with a cause.<eos> I know that I'm like a dog with a bone.<eos> Or an angry dragon on its lonely mountain of gold.<eos> That, too.<eos> I know she freaks you out...
- Well, I gave myself a promotion.<eos> I figure after two full days of nursing, I'm ready to start doctoring.<eos> Or... docting?<eos> -Both, probably.<eos> -Mmm. So what do you got in here for depression?<eos> Well, we got, uh, Zoloft and the Lexapro, and a whole bunch of stuff if you just wanna be unconscious.<eos> -This is more like a existential thing?<eos> -Oh. You know, when you get everything you ever wanted, and then you're, like, "Is that all there is?"<eos> Let me see what we got for that.<eos> Uh, let me ask you something.
What do we do now?<eos> -We dance.<eos> -It's too slow for the Barynya.<eos> You make it up, dummy. The Westerners use their hips, like Elvis Presley.<eos> You're supposed to look like you're having sex without touching.<eos> Like this?<eos> You look like you hurt yourself.<eos> -That guy is staring at us.<eos> -Not at us.<eos> At you.
-You brought a friend.<eos> -I said I would, didn't I?<eos> He wants to talk to her.<eos> Why doesn't he come over himself?<eos> He does what he wants.<eos> We all do what he wants.<eos> He makes the parties.<eos> Go.<eos> Maybe he'll make a party in your panties.<eos> I haven't seen you before.
I don't know.<eos> Make something up!<eos> Spooky children.<eos> "Spooky children," bitch? That don't even sit right with me.<eos> Look, instead of me checkin' the children, how about you check your damn self?<eos> -Um...<eos> No! -Angie, you suck at this!<eos> - No, I wasn't done! - Give it to me!<eos> Peace out.<eos> I see you!
Peace out.<eos> I see you!<eos> Hello?<eos> I said I...<eos> Come on, bitch, pick up!<eos> -You are religious?<eos> -Church of Satan, ma'am.<eos> Look. Uh, man, I should've told you there was a riot.<eos> I'm a fuckin' wuss, okay?<eos> I didn't want to worry you, you know?
You did what you had to do.<eos> I know Daya got herself in some bad shit.<eos> Just tell me she's okay.<eos> Yeah, yeah, she's okay.<eos> -You lying bitch!<eos> -What?<eos> Yo, this bitch lied to me twice!<eos> Aleida, calm down.<eos> I'm staring at my daughter in handcuffs right now!<eos> I ask you to look out for her and the next thing I know she's shooting somebody and confesses?
Have a good fucking life, okay?<eos> Fucking what?<eos> You are magnificent.<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> - Man, this shit wouldn't cut butter!<eos> Jefferson, that you?<eos> Hold up, Mr. C. We setting' you free.<eos> Not free free, but you feel me.<eos> -Are you supposed to be doing that?<eos> -Are you supposed to give a fuck?
How do you think negotiations are going?<eos> Well, if I had to take a wild stab at it, I'd say not very well.<eos> That Fig, she is a grade A, locally-sourced megabitch.<eos> Yeah. Plus MCC's lawyers would file a breach of contract before ever agreeing to increasing the budget.<eos> So I've heard.<eos> Well, here we are.<eos> In you go.<eos> - In... right here?<eos> - Mmm-hmm. It's so dark.<eos> The better to eat you with, my dear.
Norma, missing.<eos> -Oh, boy.<eos> -Frieda, missing.<eos> Gina, missing.<eos> Yoga, and now Blanca and Nicky--<eos> -Let me guess-- -Missing.<eos> I didn't know that Piscatella paid such close attention to your social circles.<eos> This is serious, damn it!<eos> Red, I wanna believe you, but you're making it impossible.<eos> Did you ever think that maybe your prison pals are avoiding you because you're being, like, an aggro psychopants?
Organize a demonstration.<eos> Before they make us all disappear, one by one.<eos> No. What we have to do is destroy the jeans, then lay low.<eos> Keep our heads down.<eos> What happened to changing the world?<eos> It's gotten too dangerous.<eos> I thought you were brave.<eos> But you don't want anything to change.<eos> You're the rebel that they can tolerate.<eos> You get to sit here and play your music and feel like a punk, but if you're threatened, you step right in line, don't you?

-You got room for one more?<eos> -Who's gonna cook?<eos> Ain't like there's food left.<eos> Right?<eos> It's nice to see you finally gettin' in the spirit.<eos> See? I told you she wasn't just a bossy twatwaffle.<eos> Is that you, Vause?<eos> I thought that you hated shower sex.<eos> I'm giving this one last shot.<eos> For you.
You gotta get me out of here. I can't do this anymore!<eos> What? Do you want me to say I'm sorry?<eos> I am sorry!<eos> Your singing was terrible.<eos> One of our recent transfers from Psych.<eos> I'm not sure she was ready for the transition.<eos> Excuse me, I purchased that baton.<eos> We let her believe that she's running the place. - Mmm...<eos> - It's easier that way.<eos> Hey, whatever gets you through the day.
Hey, whatever gets you through the day.<eos> - Hey! I was mad, I was mad, okay!<eos> - Let's go.<eos> You had lipstick on your ear... Ow!<eos> Now... you're aware of the state's prerequisites for education programs?<eos> You aware?<eos> Okay! Ow! Got it!<eos> I got it! I got the memo.<eos> Ow.<eos> Hey! Don't I know you from somewhere?
Not just to Israel now... but to America.<eos> You're not Jewish.<eos> You pay them... to find your Jewish relatives.<eos> -And how does that help me?<eos> -If we were married...<eos> So that's your plan.<eos> Listen.<eos> We don't have to be together in that way.<eos> It can all be for show.<eos> I know you think... I'm not man enough for you.
I'm really off of my game today.<eos> Anyone know if Mercury's in retrograde?<eos> I ain't buyin' the whole Counterfeit Cunt story.<eos> Don't smell right to me.<eos> Hands are too clean for a forger. She'd be inky.<eos> Or maybe she's just such a good forger, she went ahead and forged herself.<eos> What?<eos> How's she so fast?<eos> Adrenaline and lies.<eos> Yeah, you fully hiding, ain't you?
Watch closely, Nichols, 'cause you're gonna be contestant number two.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> I genuinely would love to understand how it is that a man gets to be this fucked up!<eos> Come on!<eos> What's the original narcissistic wound?<eos> Nicky, stop.<eos> He doesn't speak human.<eos> Now that is right, Stalina.<eos> Because I discovered a long time ago that actions speak a whole lot louder than words.<eos> Inmates will always try to cheat, manipulate or deceive you.
I want everyone as a witness when I tear off that mama bear costume you strut around in so proud.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm showing your family who you really are.<eos> Fucking...<eos> You're a vain... weak... pathetic... frail old jailbird.<eos> You can dye your hair, paint your face... but it doesn't change the truth underneath.<eos> Here's your fearless leader, inmates.<eos> Look!<eos> Ow! Look long and hard at what prison does to a person!<eos> I swear, I'll kill you!
And for the record, I think your sweet tooth is cute.<eos> You my sugar daddy, huh?<eos> When I was a kid, I used to steal Toblerone triangles from my mom's PMS stash... And, this one time, she caught me and she made me eat a whole jumbo bar as punishment.<eos> Did you puke?<eos> No, I ate the whole thing, and I asked her for another.<eos> -Insatiable appetite, huh?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> I think that's when she gave up trying to fix me.<eos> Thank God she did, huh?<eos> Look, you're perfect like God made you.
Good or bad white girls in the yard.<eos> There's a dead or dying guard.<eos> -Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> -Good night.<eos> Dead guard?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Over in the next bed.<eos> I have excellent peripheral vision.<eos> Like, I'm looking at you right now, but out of the corner of my eye, I can see him being very not alive.
Dummy.<eos> "Hot Cheetos.<eos> Beyoncé. Yearly gyno visits."<eos> That's one advanced kid.<eos> Turn it over.<eos> "Don't try anything, or we all die."<eos> Let's fuckin' get her.<eos> Make it count this time.<eos> I swear to God, if one more of these bitches tries to fuck me, I'm--<eos> -Nobody wants to fuck you, asshole.
Come on, hurry up.<eos> Yo, what the fuck is this?<eos> They needed a piss break.<eos> And I couldn't say no. One of them already peed on themself.<eos> Fuck no!<eos> Back in the bubble, bitches.<eos> -I gotta pee. I gotta pee.<eos> -I don't care.<eos> You too lax, Mama.<eos> Your kids must run all over you.
Used to make me feel safe.<eos> Do you ever wonder... how things that used to feel so good now feel so bad?<eos> I do.<eos> I mean, it's like, this is prison, yes.<eos> Shitty diarrhea food, nothin' to do but sit... sit around and fucking wait, but... like, I used to be able to get through it.<eos> But now I can't really even get myself up and out of bed.<eos> It's, like, there's, like, less air in here to breathe or something.<eos> And... and it used to, before, you could... you could find somebody to talk to if you wanted, you know?<eos> Or... or cookie's up their sleeve, and...<eos> Now it's, "Fuck you, inmate.
Stealing my friend behind my back, ho?<eos> You know, Boo was my best friend, right?<eos> You know, women gotta start being nicer to one another.<eos> Ooh, what about her?<eos> No, shallow nail beds.<eos> Hey, Red Light Special, where you hiding?<eos> Ladies!<eos> Hey, I'm over here.<eos> Oh, thank you, ladies.<eos> Hi. Hey, yeah, great to see you.
No, I'm... I'm not okay with this.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> Why do you even want his finger anyway?<eos> So she can finger herself with his finger forever.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - Obviously.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Wait. Wait.<eos> - Uh, you... you gotta know if it works, right?<eos> So why don't you take it for a test-drive before you commit?
-Help!<eos> -Hey, you really get off on this, don't you, you sick fuck?<eos> Red, you're beautiful.<eos> Hair grows back.<eos> Someone tell his face.<eos> Thank you, asshole.<eos> I guess not all lesbians are good with their tongue, huh?<eos> You're a real martyr, aren't you, Reznikov?<eos> Oh, don't be dramatic.<eos> I'm not gonna kill you.
You dirty cunt!<eos> No!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Oh, I've had enough of this insubordination!<eos> You are federal inmates, not the queen of the fucking Nile.<eos> Now tell me what you are, so I know you understand.<eos> You tell me!<eos> Please.<eos> Last chance.<eos> I hope that someone treats you the way that you are treating us, when you get locked up for assault, you piece of shit!
In a day or two or whenever this is over, it's gonna be my word against a bunch of criminals rotting away in Max.<eos> Who do you think they're gonna believe?<eos> I'll shove my dick back in that boca sucia qué tienes if you make a fucking sound...<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Shut the fuck--<eos> We was just wrestling.<eos> You want a turn?<eos> I mean, we loosened him up real good.<eos> Everybody knows that puto loves to fuck for cash or whatever you got laying around.<eos> I will destroy you.
Hey, look.<eos> Here we go!<eos> We're going on a trip to Medical.<eos> We're going to Medical.<eos> You fucking sicko psycho.<eos> She needs medical attention.<eos> Piper, shut up.<eos> Don't provoke an angry bear.<eos> Or any fuckin' bear.<eos> Either way you get mauled.
Many inmates have tried to make a fool of me over the years.<eos> None have succeeded.<eos> And none ever will.<eos> What, you gonna fuck me?<eos> Or you want me to fuck you?<eos> Yeah, we all know that's how you like it, you dinge queen.<eos> You a fucking bucking bronco, ain't you, you motherfucker?<eos> Kiss my fucking ass, bitch!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> This is what you do to get off, Tweety Bird?
By watching me sweat?<eos> Fucker! Fucker! Fucker!<eos> I think that's probably enough.<eos> Come on, Desi.<eos> We take 'em out when they start screaming.<eos> I don't hear anything, do you?<eos> He saw me.<eos> I know you're down here, inmate.<eos> Oh, please, make this hard for me.<eos> It'll give me the pleasure of wrecking you later.
This must be what the Maasai tribesmen feel like after they've speared an elephant.<eos> Except white men aren't exactly an endangered species, and this animal is going to wake up.<eos> Ah, he'll be out for a couple hours.<eos> - Where the hell are we?<eos> - It's a long story.<eos> - What do we do when he wakes up?<eos> - We torture him into a confession.<eos> Don't you think that we have all already suffered enough in service of your revenge scheme, Red?<eos> Did he do that to you?<eos> I think you need to go lie down.
- She's right, you know.<eos> - Oh, shut up, Joe.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Fine, I will make it happen.<eos> You win healthcare.<eos> Now can someone get me a goddamn cup of coffee?<eos> I am right on it...<eos> Tracy.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I think I should slap you and then you could slap me.
You shut the fuck up!<eos> I mean, you keep flappin' your big ass lips, and our whole peace in the Middle East thing? Canceled.<eos> - No, you lied to me. - No, I didn't...<eos> You lied!<eos> - He died!<eos> - Don't...<eos> - Shut the fuck...<eos> - Lying is very bad.<eos> - Dying is very, very bad. - Oh. Suzanne.<eos> Suzanne, I'm gonna need you to calm down, all right?
That, and a little bit of lipstick, that is all the medicine you need!<eos> Go on, get out of here.<eos> Go on!<eos> What if your self still has a headache, even after you tell it, "You're great"?<eos> Well, I hadn't, uh, considered that particular situation.<eos> This is more of an anti-depressant, anti-psychotic kinda theory.<eos> - So can I have an Advil or something?<eos> - Well, I can't see why not.<eos> As long as it doesn't affect your self-esteem.<eos> You know, I gotta say, you seem real nice.

Yo, you was killin' it in there!<eos> I know.<eos> That's why this better be motherfuckin' important.<eos> Look, we got a... a little problem.<eos> Great, it's a little problem. Little means you can handle it.<eos> We got a dead guard and Suzanne is freaking out.<eos> - Are you fucking serious?<eos> - I know, man.<eos> I know, it's bad!<eos> Come on, I'll take you...
I'm good at it.<eos> I'm getting somewhere.<eos> So you tell me what's more important... one girl who can't handle not getting her breakfast on time or the rest of us who is in here tryin' to survive every day?<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Live on the scene here at Litchfield Prison.<eos> No new activity in the last few hours. We are still awaiting any...<eos> - Hey, I was watching that!<eos> - And I was turning it off.<eos> You better get your booty to the bus stop.<eos> If the bus leaves without you, you got a long walk.
- Who?<eos> - See?<eos> Cindy.<eos> My sister?<eos> Your daughter.<eos> She's in that jail that's going off, and you're pretending she don't even exist.<eos> I care about her very much.<eos> - You're not worried?<eos> - Honey...<eos> I didn't tell you before because I didn't want you worrying, but Cindy's not in that place.
Yeah, something about behavior infractions.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Point is, she's all right and you don't have to worry about her.<eos> Focus on school, okay?<eos> She got transferred?<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You're a fucking liar.<eos> You watch your language!<eos> - Why should I listen to anything you say?
Impressive.<eos> Girl scout?<eos> All right, uh, give me a hand over here, right?<eos> I wish that we could go back to the us from two days ago and let them know that this is where we were gonna be.<eos> - Blanca, you'll carry the torch, yes?<eos> - Actually, Red, I'm pretty tired.<eos> All right, let's pretend we're at a Jewish wedding, right?<eos> One, two, three!<eos> I hate all of you.<eos> Aw, we hate you back, Red, but with love!
I hate all of you.<eos> Aw, we hate you back, Red, but with love!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - You came back!<eos> I should get kidnapped and held hostage by a psychopath more often.<eos> I've had a lot of guys make a lot of excuses for disappearing on me, but that by far is the most ridiculous one I've ever heard.<eos> Okay. I'll work on it.<eos> Hey, girl, what happened to your face?<eos> - Your friend, the feral one?<eos> - Ah. She's mad at me. She thinks I stole you or something.
Well, now, aren't you just a little bundle of Connecticut trivia?<eos> I kill at trivia night.<eos> In Connecticut.<eos> Specifically in Connecticut.<eos> Fuck, would you look at me?<eos> I'm all giggly and gay for you.<eos> Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're gay all the time.<eos> Correct.<eos> I'm just not typically "gay" gay.<eos> Aw, are you gonna pass me a note and ask me if I like you now?
We were trying to bring Piscatella over here!<eos> - Oh, shit. You put them in together?<eos> - Ain't got room otherwise.<eos> You are fire, yo.<eos> Oh, you see that?<eos> Yeah, I'll be right back.<eos> - Lourdes?<eos> - Gloria.<eos> They're taking him into surgery.<eos> If you want to talk to him first, I thought... maybe he can hear you.
I'mma be there when you wake up.<eos> I got a plan... and I'mma be right next to you before you know it.<eos> Mama's coming for you.<eos> Until I get there, I need you to...<eos> I need you to fight.<eos> You put up those fists and you fight.<eos> I ain't never gonna tell you that again after this, but today... today...<eos> Today, you fight.<eos> You fight like hell!<eos> I love you. I love you, Benjamin Mendoza.

Hoping she's coming back.<eos> Nothing's too good for my son.<eos> Only jailbait criminals for him.<eos> Don't call her that again.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> But of course.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I wonder when this insanity is gonna end.<eos> Why?<eos> Do you have some important prison business to get back to?
No!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Oh, I've had enough of this insubordination.<eos> You are federal inmates...<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Gina, you magical nymph!<eos> I stand corrected.<eos> This totally makes up for the electricity thing.<eos> Fuckin' A!<eos> To you exactly what you are doing to us right now!
This totally makes up for the electricity thing.<eos> Fuckin' A!<eos> To you exactly what you are doing to us right now!<eos> You both look great in those curtains.<eos> Please get down.<eos> Just stop it.<eos> That's... that's... that's not how it works!<eos> I think we gotta be firmer with her.<eos> Yo! Stop!<eos> Yo! Yo! You better get your ass down here before the rest of these bitches throw it down for you!
I guess you can't deny cruelty when it shows up on your Facebook feed.<eos> We must beware of the goblins.<eos> - The goblins?<eos> - She means trolls.<eos> - Right, of course.<eos> - Yes. He's a big goblin-troll.<eos> And the others like him in the webiverse could still find a way to defend him and vilify us.<eos> And we can't let that happen.<eos> We must stay on top.<eos> Red, I think it is time for you to sit down and just chill the fuck out!

Dr. Chapman is here.<eos> And I am gonna scrounge together the finest cocktail that Litchfield has to offer.<eos> I already got some Tylenol from Arsenic and Old Lace over there.<eos> It probably expired in '98.<eos> Expiration dates are a marketing scheme.<eos> Totally bogus.<eos> All right. I'm gonna go to the pharmacy.<eos> I'll see if I can get you something harder.<eos> Wait, you're actually considering going back out there?<eos> - For you.
- You know what?<eos> Go.<eos> Just go.<eos> - No.<eos> - If you want me to stay, I'll stay.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I'm serious...<eos> - I'm...<eos> Go.<eos> I actually... I actually don't even want to look at you right now.
Babe... you're actually pregnant.<eos> I mean, you're also crazy, but, uh, unless you put these in someone else's piss...<eos> - No, I did not.<eos> - Well... okay, you're with child here.<eos> No, that's not... that's not... possible, because you said...<eos> I didn't believe you.<eos> All right, maybe I was scared, you know, imagining a hairy little bambino popping out of your vajayjay.<eos> It's not exactly the stuff of masturbatory fantasies.<eos> But, uh...<eos> Hey, I'm happy for you.
Or some other escape hatch.<eos> Seemed to me like she wanted to help you.<eos> At least from where I was standing, which wasn't very close.<eos> But, you know, it's pretty tight, so it wasn't so far, either.<eos> Look, she leaves.<eos> It's what she does.<eos> Trust me.<eos> These past few days, we could've hung out together, playing house... taking advantage of the only moments of relative freedom that we're gonna have for years.<eos> But, instead, she had to go do something else.<eos> All I'm saying... is you can't tell people to go and then blame them for leaving.
Like, you know how we have to eat poop instead of food?<eos> Thank you, Linda.<eos> You know how we have to roll our own tampons out of old napkins?<eos> Well, she's your girl.<eos> How about these pillows that smell like mildew?<eos> Yup, that's her.<eos> Or these shower shoes that are so thin the tile fungus gets through the soles?<eos> Yeah, and what about these boots that weigh ten pounds each, huh?<eos> No, that's not even my department!<eos> Fuck you, Linda!
I was a freshman in college and we had this devastating hurricane.<eos> I mean, half of the university was under water, and... several of us were trapped in a dorm.<eos> Thought I would die from the heat, waiting for the life rafts to come.<eos> And then I saw your father paddling across the lawn... in a rowboat.<eos> He knew I was in there, so he volunteered to bring us some food.<eos> Cans of corn.<eos> That's what he brought me.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Yes. It's nice that you want to be there for Alex.<eos> I always thought you would be the girl in the relationship though, but I suppose there was always a healthy dose of testosterone in you.
You're getting the Kool-Aid Man.<eos> Yeah, a hero with a practical ability.<eos> - Breaking through a wall?<eos> - No.<eos> He satisfies your thirst on demand.<eos> That's a hero in my book.<eos> That's a cocktail waitress.<eos> I'm still holding out for the ability to fly.<eos> All done.<eos> Your mother's gonna kill you.
And believe me, Al... it's no "Love is pain."<eos> Blast from the past.<eos> Do you recognize my voice?<eos> Boy, well, I guess things...<eos> You know things are bad when you're calling old girlfriends from the bathroom floor in the middle of the night, huh?<eos> How are you still... in my brain?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Do you miss me?<eos> Probably not.<eos> I miss you.
Okay.<eos> I need you to listen to me for a second.<eos> I think that this thing might be over and I'm gonna be able to get you some real help soon, but first... I want you to have this.<eos> - Beans.<eos> - A can of beans?<eos> Just pretend it's corn.<eos> It's a very long story.<eos> You have taught me... that... love hurts.<eos> You've taught me that life... It hurts.<eos> And I want to be there for you.
When did the symptoms start?<eos> Not sure.<eos> Right before the fish started dying.<eos> The fish are dying?<eos> Floating on the sea to the horizon in every direction.<eos> It's not contagious.<eos> Let's get them to medbay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I got you. Ok.
Let's get them to medbay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I got you. Ok.<eos> All right.<eos> There you go.<eos> It's already here.<eos> It's not safe for you here.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I need you to handle something for me the way you handled Ambassador Rafel.
You tell yourself that if you need to, but the radiation isn't killing that child.<eos> You are.<eos> You're looking for these?<eos> Where did you g... never mind.<eos> I didn't know how many you needed, so I took it all.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Go. Be doctors.<eos> Give it to the child first, and if it works, you give it to the others.<eos> I'm glad you're back, John.<eos> I was worried about you.
Ok?<eos> It's ok.<eos> Adria... it's ok.<eos> You can trust them.<eos> It's like food.<eos> Just put it in your mouth and take it down with the water.<eos> There you go.<eos> That's it.<eos> Easy, easy.<eos> Ok. I got you.

Hey, no, no, no.<eos> What's the point?<eos> A.L.I.E. used tech to control us.<eos> No one will ever take over our minds again.<eos> So you're the new Flamekeeper.<eos> This is a sacred space.<eos> Leave before you get hurt.<eos> Give me the Flame.<eos> It does not belong to you or your red-blooded king.<eos> I can't let you leave with it.
You pervert our faith.<eos> Heda would be ashamed.<eos> I'm doing what's best for Trikru.<eos> You would understand that if you had stayed and done your duty.<eos> I was called.<eos> My daughter was not meant to wander the earth looking for Nightbloods.<eos> My daughter was meant to lead armies.<eos> My daughter was meant to lead our people.<eos> Looks like you found that daughter now.<eos> Roan sent me here to kill you.
My daughter was meant to lead armies.<eos> My daughter was meant to lead our people.<eos> Looks like you found that daughter now.<eos> Roan sent me here to kill you.<eos> If I don't come back with the Flame, he will send others.<eos> If the spirit of the Commanders deems it my time, then so be it.<eos> Indra, tell me what you want me to do here.<eos> Without the Flame, the king is vulnerable.<eos> We will need to fight to keep him on the throne.<eos> If that's what you want me to do, I'll do it for you.

No insects.<eos> What?<eos> Luna said the fish were dying.<eos> What are the things that eat the fish and bugs gonna eat now?<eos> What happened to us deserving a lucky break?<eos> So what are we looking for?<eos> The bunker would have been at the lowest point.<eos> Anything structural.<eos> Be careful.<eos> She's lucky to have you.
The radiation would have killed them in days.<eos> This won't save anyone.<eos> Leave us.<eos> He was one of the looters.<eos> You were wrong about the Flamekeeper.<eos> And the Flame?<eos> Destroyed before I could kill him.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It'll be more dangerous now.<eos> More people will have to die to keep me in power, not that that bothers you,
What?<eos> - I wanna be that person.<eos> - What person?<eos> The person that does this for, like, an hour and then leaves.<eos> That's not what this...<eos> Doug, I've been having sex for as long as you have.<eos> And when you called me, that's what it sounded like.<eos> And I thought, "Great." But I'm here now.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I should take you home.

Good morning, America.<eos> God bless America, and thank you.<eos> And we're out.<eos> Okay, guys.<eos> You did great.<eos> - You did it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Everyone is so pleased.<eos> I know it was tough, but you got through it.<eos> - I'm really proud of you. - Thank you.
It was on my way home.<eos> No, it wasn't just on your way home.<eos> We tried to go to the Museum of Fine Arts.<eos> It was closed.<eos> It was freezing that day.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And this was on in your room.<eos> - It was.<eos> - And I asked you to kiss me.<eos> - I made you kiss me.

I thought it might be a heterotopic pregnancy.<eos> There's no indications of anything outside the uterus.<eos> We can rule that one out.<eos> What about anemia?<eos> Well, your blood count's fine and... your blood pressure's normal.<eos> Is there any possibility you might have just been overdoing it?<eos> No.<eos> You had a lot of pressure on you.<eos> She was in quite a state before the collapse.<eos> I've never seen you like that before.
I thought you were long dead.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Free booze.<eos> Aunty... what happened?<eos> You don't remember?<eos> The CA... piled into the Zone.<eos> Smoke and noise everywhere.<eos> And a man in a flash suit, cold eyes... he walk right through that smoke.<eos> So many shots.<eos> They dragged you away.
Marion Frith is not as smart as she thinks she is.<eos> This is a direct feed.<eos> What about Koen West?<eos> My guy's program should be able to track him.<eos> There, he passed through a CA checkpoint beside Central Station an hour and a half ago.<eos> And the Authority?<eos> Well, no one else knows who he is.<eos> Hey, come out here.<eos> Come on.<eos> I can see you.
- What happened to your head?<eos> Don't ask.<eos> Let's get in the car.<eos> We're running late.<eos> Paging Dr. Blair.<eos> Dr. Blair, please report to ICU.<eos> Report to ICU.<eos> - Charlotte.<eos> - Hey, Deepak.<eos> I wasn't expecting you back so soon.

I couldn't let you run outpatients all on your own.<eos> Are you sure you're okay?<eos> How many years you been telling me what I should do?<eos> Twelve... wait, no, 14 years.<eos> My God, you make me sound so old.<eos> - Well, you are old.<eos> - So rude. Anyway, I thought your OB ordered bed rest until next week.<eos> Are you conspiring with my husband, Deepak?<eos> Can I get the, um, patients list for today?<eos> Well, I wouldn't blame him for treating you like glass.
- Well, not a bad start.<eos> Gotta say that blast hurt like hell.<eos> I'm sorry, aunty.<eos> I'm here, aren't I?<eos> All in one piece.<eos> You did what needed to be done.<eos> They're gonna pay. For Mungo.<eos> For Blair.<eos> - And for all the Hairies.<eos> - I hear you.
She?<eos> Our child's a girl now, is it?<eos> I think you should come home now.<eos> I'll be home once my shift is finished.<eos> - We can discuss it then.<eos> - Charlotte, you're coming with me.<eos> I will not be spoken to like that.<eos> And I won't have the safety of our child jeopardized.<eos> - Gather your things.<eos> - I don't work for you, Jarrod.
- Come up!<eos> You must submit to the CA!<eos> Hands on your head!<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, - What happened?<eos> It's okay, it's okay, you're fine.<eos> You're fine.<eos> Baby's fine.<eos> Have you run any tests?<eos> Nobody's run anything.<eos> I checked your vitals and hid you away in here.
We're prepped for fetal extraction.<eos> And this group is being set up to mimic a subhuman womb.<eos> The fetus will continue to develop normally?<eos> Exactly as if it were in a healthy mother.<eos> No danger to the mother with this procedure?<eos> Any surgical intervention carries a certain risk, but the risk is not significantly greater here.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Ah, you hear that, boy?<eos> It's killing me.<eos> Means the past is reaching out to you, trying to show you something.

You won't get anywhere near your husband.<eos> - I'm going.<eos> - I know Waruu.<eos> He knows your people.<eos> He'll make it impossible.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> - He's my son.<eos> - Koen and Waruu?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Does that make you feel better?
This was because he had a special boomerang.<eos> His was much faster and would never miss.<eos> The younger hunter asked the old people where he could get a boomerang like this."<eos> "The old people told him of a special tree, so the younger hunter headed out to cut himself a stronger and much larger boomerang.<eos> But the younger hunter did not notice that the tree's blood ran hot and poured like lava.<eos> It was the blood that made the older hunter's boomerang so powerful.<eos> It would cut through his prey, killing them instantly."<eos> Araluen, wait!<eos> It's not...<eos> I haven't seen you in such a good mood in ages.
Drives a red minivan, had a woman with him.<eos> Last numbers on the plate were something like 971.<eos> So, where's your boyfriend?<eos> You don't know anything about him.<eos> Alinta.<eos> Mum!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> He's CA.<eos> Grab your stuff.<eos> Culture is difficult to control, and being a Cleverman forces you to be consumed by it.
What are you doing?<eos> He's CA.<eos> Grab your stuff.<eos> Culture is difficult to control, and being a Cleverman forces you to be consumed by it.<eos> How's that?<eos> Ah, you listen to the voices in your head.<eos> Some people think that you're crazy.<eos> The more they say it, the more you believe it, and you find yourself in a dark place where no words can help you.<eos> If you couldn't handle everything, what makes you think I can?<eos> Well, you've been dealing with this your whole life... people talking about you, putting you down,

I told him to be calm.<eos> Latani.<eos> There's Latani.<eos> We need to find her.<eos> But you're safe?<eos> When you look like me... the CA don't shoot.<eos> They prefer to pretend that I'm not here.<eos> You are here.<eos> If you give me your keys and a list of things you need, I'm happy to go get them.<eos> I can't ask you to do that.
No one else knows, just you, me, and our doctor.<eos> - You can trust him, I promise you.<eos> - Trust?<eos> You did this to your wife!<eos> So that we can raise our child together.<eos> We can be an example to those that come after.<eos> When were you gonna tell me?<eos> - What, after it was born?<eos> - I wanted to tell you, believe me, but you were so happy.<eos> I... I didn't want to confuse you.
I... I didn't want to confuse you.<eos> I didn't know how you'd react.<eos> Can I carry this baby safely to term?<eos> How long is the term?<eos> Do you know?<eos> Do you know any of that?<eos> Or is it just cross your fingers and hope for the best?<eos> And you say that you love me!<eos> I wouldn't do this unless I was sure it was safe.<eos> - I'd never hurt you.
- Did she kill them?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Did Linda kill my parents?<eos> Yeah, she did.<eos> Well done, little brother.<eos> You finally figured it out.<eos> Linda's never been the woman you thought she was.<eos> She's cold-blooded.<eos> She knew exactly what she was doing when she rammed their car.<eos> She was after you, too.
He... didn't kill any of those men, did he?<eos> No.<eos> They appear to have been... stunned only.<eos> Are you suggesting it's not dangerous?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm just gathering as much information as I can.<eos> If you can't tell me what it is, what it wants, how we can deter it?<eos> Trust me, Minister, I will find a way to stop him.<eos> Let me know if there's any developments.<eos> - Been worried about you.
What kind of person... mother does that?<eos> Did you plan it?<eos> Deliberately set the whole thing up?<eos> Answer me.<eos> Koen...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> That's it?<eos> "Sorry"?<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> I don't even know you.
Get out of here.<eos> But just the mum.<eos> You can't separate them.<eos> You are in no position to negotiate.<eos> - It'll be alright.<eos> - What about the girls?<eos> I'll take them in for processing.<eos> Oh, man, you can't do that!<eos> Listen, sunshine.<eos> Take the deal or I'll report you.
Quiet down, darling.<eos> - Watch your head.<eos> - Watch your head. - Mum!<eos> Mum!<eos> Where are they taking them?<eos> Processing, alright?<eos> We have got to go.<eos> You can't separate us. Please!<eos> You being locked up won't help, alright?<eos> Alinta, I'll come for you.
I've gotta follow something up.<eos> Sorry, she's being interviewed.<eos> I'd say she won't be going anywhere tonight.<eos> Give me a call when she's done. Dolan, 249.<eos> Uncle Jimmy...<eos> Did he mention a way to get my muya back?<eos> I think the muya can only be re-entered if someone's dead.<eos> I have to wait?<eos> You should kill me.<eos> I don't know if I can bring you back.
This is Waruu, isn't it?<eos> I messed both you boys up.<eos> I thought cancer was my punishment, but I should have realised it was bigger than that.<eos> I'm condemned to live alone for eternity.<eos> Aunty...<eos> It's alright, boy.<eos> I don't expect anything from you.<eos> Things are as they should be.<eos> I guess we've got nothing to lose if we give it a try, then.<eos> Your friend, Tim Dolan, gave you to me.
Preying on weak, innocent humans.<eos> Selling them your sob story.<eos> I'm not afraid of you.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, we're going to have a little fun, then.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Not if you were the last thing on earth, darling.<eos> You're probably crawling with lice.<eos> So, how fast are you, subbie?<eos> I want to see you run.
Don't worry.<eos> And all of her details now, including her crime, - are in the system.<eos> - I am the system.<eos> Release her to me under house arrest, put a security tag on her.<eos> I'll deal with the charges later.<eos> Now, where is she?<eos> I'll take you.<eos> Thank God you're alright.<eos> How stupid are you?<eos> Nice to see you too, Dad.
Does your mother know what you've been up to?<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> We all got split up when we were arrested.<eos> I need to find Latani.<eos> - You're coming home with me.<eos> - No way.<eos> I'm not losing you again.
- I don't know.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> We all got split up when we were arrested.<eos> I need to find Latani.<eos> - You're coming home with me.<eos> - No way.<eos> I'm not losing you again.<eos> You didn't lose me.<eos> They're going to fit you with a security tag.

I loved your father.<eos> Too much.<eos> I just drove straight at them.<eos> And I could see your mother had gone into labour.<eos> I grabbed her arm and I pulled...<eos> I pulled her from the wreckage.<eos> There was... so much blood.<eos> And you were coming.<eos> I could see that.<eos> Weren't nothing going to stop you popping out right there, in the glass and... blood and metal.
And you were coming.<eos> I could see that.<eos> Weren't nothing going to stop you popping out right there, in the glass and... blood and metal.<eos> I didn't have to do much.<eos> I always thought it was my fault that she died.<eos> This got nothing to do with you, boy.<eos> I brought all this on.<eos> I guess we're even, then.<eos> Enough yapping.<eos> We gotta get you out of them clothes.
I think we better call the police.<eos> No, no, wait, wait, wait.<eos> You're not gonna tell them, are you?<eos> Perhaps we could come up with a story or...<eos> Oh, God, I'm sorry.<eos> Why did he want to remove your child?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think maybe he didn't trust me.<eos> Why not?<eos> Why did you let him drag you into all this mess?
No, no, wait, wait, wait.<eos> You're not gonna tell them, are you?<eos> Perhaps we could come up with a story or...<eos> Oh, God, I'm sorry.<eos> Why did he want to remove your child?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think maybe he didn't trust me.<eos> Why not?<eos> Why did you let him drag you into all this mess?<eos> Let you be the face of the initiative?
- Where's your mum?<eos> - I'll show you.<eos> And you reckon this CA fella Dolan will help me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Where's Latani?<eos> - They separated us.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> It goes off if I step outside the house.<eos> He's holding you here?
I don't know.<eos> - Where's Latani?<eos> - They separated us.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> It goes off if I step outside the house.<eos> He's holding you here?<eos> Well, then we smash it off.<eos> That'll set off the alarm too.<eos> I'm not leaving you here with him.
No need.<eos> Kimbo's.<eos> Wanna help me get some bowls?<eos> Sure.<eos> Denied.<eos> Denied.<eos> God.<eos> Security tag deactivated.<eos> You're giving alcohol to kids now?<eos> Just treating you like an adult.
You know, I saw footage of the attack on the CA vans.<eos> I don't know how you survived.<eos> You left us for dead.<eos> They were gonna kill us.<eos> And you just left.<eos> You're right.<eos> Is this where you say you're going to make it all better?<eos> Nah, I can't make it better.<eos> Truth is, I screwed up.<eos> But I found you, and I got them to release you to me, and now you're here.
Of course you were.<eos> I didn't know where you'd gone.<eos> Why you'd left.<eos> I know.<eos> But I'm here now.<eos> The city's on high alert.<eos> It's not safe.<eos> But everything I do is for us.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> I love you.

That's my girl.<eos> - Confirm, dispatch.<eos> - No activity.<eos> East entrance is clear.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Going to have to buy you some pyjamas. Guess so.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Goodnight, Dad.<eos> It's good to have you back.
Get him out of here.<eos> Gonna be a hero, Tim?<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You know, they're not the enemy, you are.<eos> - Keep it going!<eos> - Move!<eos> Move!<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - You.
- That's an order.<eos> Hold your fire.<eos> I repeat, hold your fire.<eos> You told them, hmm?<eos> You skin.<eos> No.<eos> You come from outside.<eos> Place is guarded.<eos> How did you do it?<eos> No-one asked you to come.
You come from outside.<eos> Place is guarded.<eos> How did you do it?<eos> No-one asked you to come.<eos> We can make them listen.<eos> It's not your fight.<eos> Move!<eos> Wait.<eos> You can't go out there.<eos> They'll kill you.
Without skins.<eos> Killing more people won't change anything.<eos> We fight now.<eos> We fight for sovereignty.<eos> That won't get you anything but bloodshed.<eos> When has this land ever not had bloodshed on it?<eos> You'll kill some of them.<eos> Sure.<eos> But then they'll kill all of you and they'll start here.<eos> And when all of you included are gone and they've bled the city dry, they'll move out to the mountains, to the mobs in the deserts and the plains.
- Hide. Like scared little children!<eos> I know a way out of here.<eos> I've used it before.<eos> - Then we run.<eos> - No-one's running.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> You're going to force them to stay?<eos> Kill your own people if they resist you?<eos> Jarli, come with us.<eos> We need you.
The people in this building did nothing wrong.<eos> People?<eos> Subhumans.<eos> They killed an innocent man here last night.<eos> You've taken everything away from them.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The government needs to sit down and negotiate a treaty<eos> - with the Hairypeople.<eos> - Our people don't even have a treaty.<eos> What makes you think the Hairies will get one?
Can you at least tell me who got the part?<eos> Was it Jeanie Barton?<eos> She's... in the mix.<eos> You bring me in a lot.<eos> And you never cast me.<eos> If there's something I need to change, I wanna change it.<eos> Every director says, "Bring me someone I don't know.<eos> Someone I haven't seen.<eos> I want a girl who's real."<eos> So, I bring you in so they can see that they don't actually want the thing they think they want.
Well...<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Obviously you shouldn't do porn.<eos> Unless it's, like, porn Shakespeare.<eos> Since you're such a nerd, you'd probably enjoy that.<eos> You know, I miss you making fun of me.<eos> Why don't you come visit me in Pasadena, then? - Ugh.<eos> It's so far away.<eos> - Come on.<eos> I've called you like a million times to hang out.
Isn't that how it works?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> - Witness is playing at the Dome.<eos> - I can't leave my mom with Randy all day.<eos> She'll feed him Funyuns and Fresca and government conspiracies.<eos> Go.<eos> Go, I get it.<eos> I, um...<eos> I miss you, too.
- Okay.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no, no!<eos> - Witness is playing at the Dome.<eos> - I can't leave my mom with Randy all day.<eos> She'll feed him Funyuns and Fresca and government conspiracies.<eos> Go.<eos> Go, I get it.<eos> I, um...<eos> I miss you, too.<eos> Randy only loves you 'cause your boobs are full of food.
I miss you, too.<eos> Randy only loves you 'cause your boobs are full of food.<eos> Is that...<eos> Am I...<eos> Oh, I didn't...<eos> I didn't hear the beep.<eos> Ruth. Hi, it's Mallory.<eos> There's an audition.<eos> I'm not running it.<eos> They're looking for unconventional women, whatever the hell that means, and I thought of you.
You don't think wrestling is acting?<eos> It's not, is it?<eos> It's...<eos> It's more like a sport with costumes?<eos> Or...<eos> Sorry, are you... Are you hiring actors to play wrestlers, or are we the wrestlers?<eos> Yes.<eos> Which one?<eos> Do people think you're pretty?<eos> Because, like, I'm looking at you... One second, I think, "Fuck, yeah, she's hot,"
Are you kidding me?<eos> You know how hard that was? You ever tried to climb a trellis?<eos> Wh...?<eos> I'm pretty proud of myself.<eos> For trying to cheat on your wife again?<eos> Let's not... Don't...<eos> Please, can we not use those words?<eos> This isn't normal behavior for me.<eos> I just... I can't...<eos> - I can't stop thinking about you.
Oh, Christ.<eos> This throw is called the hair mare.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Your turn, ladies.<eos> So, what's our backstory?<eos> Our what?<eos> What's motivating this?<eos> Why are we fighting?<eos> What's... What's driving you to come after me and grab me by the hair and throw me to the ground?
You just gotta tug on my hair a little bit. I'll do the rest.<eos> Nice.<eos> Good job, Cherry.<eos> Cute outfit, Pippi Longstockings.<eos> Next!<eos> Get off of me!<eos> Creepy, but I like it.<eos> Next!<eos> Please!<eos> I beg you!
- Why?<eos> - What do you mean, "Why?"<eos> I gave you basic direction. You didn't follow it. You're both out.<eos> There are no scenes to read, no character work, so, yes, we improvised.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Fucking actresses.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm feeling generous.<eos> Sophie's Choice.<eos> Why should I pick you and not her?
I don't know.<eos> Maybe I like both of 'em too much. I don't...<eos> I don't have to explain myself.<eos> That's the beauty of being a director.<eos> You're out.<eos> Move out of my way, fuckwad!<eos> What you smiling at, you Pert Plus-looking bitch?<eos> Are you guys a band or something?<eos> Fuck that. We're the Los Angeles Death Squad.<eos> Fuck you, Nancy Reagan.
Weighing in... at a hundred and... fifteen pounds...<eos> Yeah!<eos> Mr. Ric Flair.<eos> Premenstrual Syndrome.<eos> She gets moody.<eos> And now she needs a nap.<eos> Sleep!<eos> Train, say your prayers, eat your vitamins.<eos> Chewables and the swallow kind.<eos> I'm coming for you, Hep Cat.
You're wrong about me.<eos> Yeah, I doubt it.<eos> Damn, girl.<eos> How long must this... go on?<eos> This punishment?<eos> Haven't I served my term?<eos> Can't I apply... for a pardon?<eos> You know what I feel like?<eos> I feel... all the time... like a cat... On a hot tin roof.<eos> Who has come here... to save... you... and you... and you... from evil.

On a hot tin roof.<eos> Who has come here... to save... you... and you... and you... from evil.<eos> Train. Say your prayers. Eat your vitamins.<eos> 'Cause, uh...<eos> - You fucking bitch!<eos> Oh, you fucking cunt!<eos> I should fucking kill you!
I don't know...<eos> I don't know what I'm supposed to do.<eos> It just happened.<eos> Haven't you learned anything from that sad fucking scene study class?<eos> Things don't just happen.<eos> People make choices.<eos> They want things, and then they go for them.<eos> Can we go somewhere and talk about this?<eos> - I don't wanna fucking talk to you. - I wanna... I wanna kick your ass.<eos> And then I never want to see you again.
You know, I found bus fares.<eos> Caitlin said I could live with them...<eos> - That's never gonna happen.<eos> - No, ma'am. Her mother drinks every day.<eos> But you are laundering money.<eos> I'm helping people, uh, get their money back into the bank so they can pay their taxes.<eos> I got a job interview.<eos> - What?<eos> How? - Technology.<eos> - I'll give you a ride.
How? - Technology.<eos> - I'll give you a ride.<eos> - No, thanks, I can Uber.<eos> Wendy, you know, you can borrow the minivan for the groceries, and I can use Buddy's car out back.<eos> - Do either of you want anything?<eos> - Yeah. Maybe you could pick up some pistachio ice cream?<eos> Organic, please?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> There's no Uber.<eos> I'm happy to give you a ride when I'm done with my day, if you can wait.
I'm happy to give you a ride when I'm done with my day, if you can wait.<eos> Now, listen...<eos> I know this is a bad situation.<eos> I get it. But we're all in this together.<eos> We're gonna suck it up.<eos> Whining's not gonna help.<eos> That's your pep talk?<eos> That's my pep talk. Also, grab a box.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> If I was kidding, I would've said you're witty and handsome.
- Deposit this.<eos> - What?<eos> Why? - Just do it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> - Good what?<eos> You, Ruth Langmore, just committed an overt act.<eos> Wh-What the fuck's that?<eos> See this camera?<eos> It sees you.
- Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> - Good what?<eos> You, Ruth Langmore, just committed an overt act.<eos> Wh-What the fuck's that?<eos> See this camera?<eos> It sees you.<eos> And it saw you just make that deposit.<eos> Now if I'm ever arrested for anything having to do with that money, the fact that you just made that deposit for me, the feds consider that an overt act.<eos> Makes you an accomplice.
You wanna wash dishes for minimum wage, you can be my guest.<eos> And now, in local news, a man from Osage Beach was hurt in a boating accident late last night near mile marker four off the Gravois Arm.<eos> According to the State Highway Patrol, Henry Bullock sustained several injuries when his boat struck a commercial dock.<eos> Mr. Bullock was transported by ambulance to Lake Regional Hospital, where he has been pronounced stable.<eos> The boat was severely damaged as well.<eos> And now to sports, where the St. Louis Cardinals look to extend their three-game winning streak as they begin a...<eos> I will say, "I will stand up for God!"<eos> Fucking kill myself.<eos> I know you're pissed off at your mother, but she still could've given you a ride.<eos> Don't worry, I am just as pissed at you. - But what Wendy did was wrong.
Just...<eos> What's that, uh, movie?<eos> Fuck. Robert De Niro and the other...<eos> - Step off.<eos> - Raging Bull.<eos> Yeah, Raging Bull.<eos> That's it.<eos> Come on, up. Stand up and hit me...<eos> I'm asking you, step away from my boy!<eos> - Fuck you, man!
Did you have any idea he was working for them?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I gotta get the rest of this shit off the yard.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm getting used to betrayal.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Working.<eos> - What's it look like?<eos> - I didn't hire you.
No, honestly, we just...<eos> we needed a change.<eos> And it's... it's a nice resort.<eos> Well, it's a fixer-upper, that's for sure.<eos> Oh, the kids are great. Yeah, yeah, they're great.<eos> There's a huge, huge lake here.<eos> So, you know, what's not to like?<eos> I know. I...<eos> I know.<eos> Linda, I have to call you back. Let me call you back.
You got issues, dude.<eos> So I've been told.<eos> Motherfuckers.<eos> - What are you doing up?<eos> - I couldn't sleep either.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't expect you to forgive me... but I am trying to make everything right. Okay?<eos> I know.<eos> You sure?<eos> - Who loves you?
- What about the safe?<eos> - It's in the office.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's black, made of steel.<eos> Has one of those dials you turn, like on my high school locker.<eos> There you go.<eos> So, where to?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I'm supposed to fuck you now, right?
Would you die without that oxygen?<eos> Hey, I don't know.<eos> Am I dead yet?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wanna try?<eos> It's cold.<eos> Eduardo, Eduardo...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Uh, listen.<eos> I hear you.
They constipate me.<eos> Just trust me.<eos> No, Marty, I used to trust you.<eos> Now I don't know.<eos> Hello?<eos> Ruth, can I talk to you?<eos> Let's go to my office.<eos> Nice.<eos> Like a... like a serial killer's lair.<eos> - I have a job for you.
This is a situation where the less you know, the better.<eos> And what's in it for me?<eos> If you wanna get ahead in business, it's questions like that, asked in that way, that you're gonna want to avoid.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Is that businesslike enough?<eos> Listen, I don't like to give extraneous details.<eos> There's a safe.<eos> And I need the contents.<eos> Anything else would be extraneous or counterproductive.<eos> However, I... I will admit that it is relevant to tell you that I'm offering you ten percent of what's inside.
There's a safe.<eos> And I need the contents.<eos> Anything else would be extraneous or counterproductive.<eos> However, I... I will admit that it is relevant to tell you that I'm offering you ten percent of what's inside.<eos> And what's on the inside?<eos> That's where we get into the extraneous again.<eos> It's at my risk.<eos> I want 80%.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> As your boss, I hope I'm not gonna have to negotiate every single time I ask you to do something.
- Bobby Dean for Jacob.<eos> Darlene?<eos> Could we have a couple of glasses, please?<eos> Some lemonade? Thank you.<eos> Hello?<eos> It says, "Wendy" on my father's phone.<eos> I think you knew him.<eos> I... I'm sure you did.<eos> We all have lots of questions about his death, and I was wondering if you maybe had any information.<eos> How'd they treat you down there?
- Naperville.<eos> Ah, the Naper-thrill.<eos> Nice.<eos> I'm Zach.<eos> Charlotte.<eos> You gotta...<eos> See, here, that goes in there...<eos> So you live here? Now?<eos> Uh, only for the summer.<eos> So is there any chance I can get you to the party cove?
- You know, the waitress with the teeth.<eos> This whole town's like a big fuckin' game of telephone.<eos> Yeah, except Mary said that... they just saw Bobby Dean's head floating in the water, just bobbing all like...<eos> Well, what'd you tell them?<eos> I told them Bobby Dean didn't have a nice body anyway.<eos> Man tits.<eos> Okay. Well, obviously, I didn't kill anyone.<eos> I know. If you're a killer, then I'm fucking Snow White.<eos> - And I don't see any dwarfs around.<eos> - Right. So, listen, Ruth, um, I need you to, um, take care of things around here for a little while.
Things are a little, uh, complicated at the house right now.<eos> Well... if anyone knows complicated, it's me.<eos> Well, my wife's talking to her dead lover's son.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What about your...<eos> - Fuck of the week?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, well, company's better out here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, no lap dance for you.
The fuck is wrong with you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just got carried away.<eos> Stay away from me, you fucking fag!<eos> Faggot!<eos> - All right. All right. All right.<eos> - Get... get the fuck out!<eos> The fuck out of my truck!<eos> - All right.<eos> All right. - Fuck you!
Hi. - Mason.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Grace.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Thanks for having us.<eos> - Course.<eos> We can go out to the porch here.<eos> Don't swim past that red buoy.<eos> Boats come out of nowhere, they'll sweep you up in their wake.
You know, I don't want to have to fight you.<eos> Stop, stop. Stop! Stop!<eos> Okay.<eos> Just...<eos> You're drunk.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - And?<eos> Ruling days.<eos> Okay. How long does it take you to forget that someone threw you off a boat?<eos> Maybe the same amount of time it takes to forget that somebody's mother threw a dead animal at you.
Um, I don't know.<eos> But I would like to use the bathroom.<eos> There's a really nice one up the road I want to show you.<eos> There something wrong with yours?<eos> - No, it's just... guys.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Just, uh... Just don't mind the mess.<eos> Uh, bathroom's down the hall, to the left.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You tell anybody about this, I'll fucking kill you.
You know, uh... work.<eos> - Hey, Wyatt.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Got some fiberglass work on the Lucas boat.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Dad, just give me a second.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, well, it was, uh... it was really good to see you.
What then?<eos> We run.<eos> We put the kids in the car, and we run.<eos> You know, we do need money.<eos> We do. We need money.<eos> We need clean money in our name.<eos> All of our personal assets are wrapped up in that goddamn bulldozed house and the church lot.<eos> - We're fucked.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Look, you just focus on Del's money...
Fuck!<eos> Russ, what was she talking about in there?<eos> What is in motion?<eos> Let's just say Marty Byrde isn't gonna be investing in much anymore.<eos> And what does that mean?<eos> If you and Ruth are planning on doing something, I wanna know about it.<eos> Especially if it has to do with...<eos> Hey, would you look at me?<eos> Don't go doing something that's gonna get your ass thrown in jail.<eos> I just fucking found you.
Thirty fucking minutes later, unrigged.<eos> Marty Byrde steps out safe, sound, not at all electrocuted!<eos> You wanna tell me what the fuck happened?<eos> Oh, shit, you were gonna do it today?<eos> Shut up, Boyd.<eos> Russ, you're the only other person on this fucking planet who knew what I intended.<eos> The fuck are you accusing me of?<eos> Hey, maybe you just didn't rig it right, Ruth.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Why don't I rig our dock right now and throw you in?
Okay, bye.<eos> Whatever happened to my toy chest?<eos> - They lost it.<eos> - How?<eos> Sometimes, things just... get lost.<eos> I hate it here.<eos> I know.<eos> Hi.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, well, I was worried about you.
I need you to go now. Please.<eos> Listen. I have a target I need to hit.<eos> I need some more time. I need until the fall.<eos> Hey.<eos> Listen. Hey.<eos> Rachel. Listen to me.<eos> I work for somebody...<eos> Stop fucking around with the paper.<eos> - Marty, I need you to go now.<eos> - I know. I heard you.
If I get a hunting license this semester?<eos> Honey, I don't want you shooting anything.<eos> You're supposed to kill starlings.<eos> They're invaders.<eos> They steal nests and peck unhatched eggs.<eos> - Please stop talking.<eos> - Charlotte. If you kill one female, you've stopped the production of 11 birds.<eos> Okay. I'll be back later.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Love you.
Then start packing.<eos> We're not the kind of people who run from something like this.<eos> - We have a child to worry about now.<eos> - That God will protect.<eos> Just like he did in St. Louis.<eos> - Mason...<eos> - That bullet was three-tenths of an inch from rupturing my aorta.<eos> But it went clean through.<eos> That is not a coincidence.<eos> God wasn't protecting you.
Something serious.<eos> All day, I've seen versions of how I could end up and I hate them all.<eos> I miss who I was.<eos> I miss my friends.<eos> Your friends are always gonna be your friends, no matter what.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You made it so that I can't tell them anything.<eos> I have to pretend like the worst, scariest, most damaging thing in my life is actually fucking awesome.<eos> And watching their Snapchat stories is like FOMO 24/7.<eos> I hear you.
You think you'd sell any houses?<eos> And you know we don't put the signs on the street anymore.<eos> We put 'em on the lake side now.<eos> You know that.<eos> - "We"?<eos> - Okay, me.<eos> I don't put the signs on the street anymore.<eos> "We don't put signs on the street."<eos> Boy, you can't even think for yourself.<eos> Okay, that's enough. 'Cause I think you're being childish, how about that?
Brass and nickel bodies and blades.<eos> Turn it over.<eos> "Co-founders Robert Powell and Russ Langmore."<eos> Your name should come first, you know.<eos> Alphabetical order.<eos> This whole thing was your idea.<eos> - Anyway, you wanted to talk.<eos> What?<eos> You called me, remember?<eos> I just... wanted to see you, is all.
Let me ask you a question.<eos> How long before you follow them?<eos> To Chicago.<eos> How long?<eos> - We're not talking about me.<eos> - The fuck we're not.<eos> This is another betrayal.<eos> How long you been planning this?<eos> - Tell me. - Hey, look.<eos> I have done nothing since I've been here except support you, and I've been saving this family over and over again.
You have a video on your computer of me.<eos> That's just a confirmation of exactly who you are.<eos> You've been watching it for months.<eos> There's a counter on that thing and you have watched it 27 times.<eos> You think I wanted to see that even once, Wendy?<eos> If you knew, why didn't you confront me?<eos> And what would I say? Anything!<eos> Anything at all.<eos> Instead of pushing all of those emotions down, distancing yourself - from anything you feel. - Hang on...<eos> Do not change the subject to me 'cause we're talking about you.

Right?<eos> Or the fuckin' first time he slapped your ass.<eos> Why would I say no, Marty?<eos> Why?<eos> Who was I saving myself for?<eos> Intimacy from you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Any affection from you?<eos> - Well, you didn't, did you? - You shut me out the minute we decided to launder the stupid fucking money.<eos> Well, maybe I was trying to protect you.

I wanted you.<eos> I wanted you, you idiot.
I told you to call my lawyer.<eos> Oh, sure, I'll call, but just thought you might wanna see this.<eos> Dad! Dad, look at me now!<eos> You know your choices, right?<eos> - Work with me... - Dad! Or watch Anthony grow up from a six-by-ten while you chow down on bean gruel with roach feces,<eos> - and try to navigate risky showers. - Dad!<eos> Look at me, Dad!<eos> - Your call.<eos> - Look at me, Dad!<eos> - Damn it, Anthony, I see you!
- Hey.<eos> - Sorry I'm late.<eos> Oh, what?<eos> You never seen a kiss before?<eos> - So, what did I miss?<eos> - Ma was just pining for the days when you could get lung cancer with your lunch.<eos> My dad would agree with you.<eos> No... You know, it's our generation.<eos> But, you know, he never gives me credit for how progressive I am.<eos> He kept you a secret from me for over a year.
I'll be right back, okay?<eos> - You get that.<eos> - I'll get that.<eos> Honey, the kids were all alone in the yard.<eos> It's been five minutes. It's just...<eos> It's only five minutes. - But that's five minutes.<eos> - What do you want me to do? Burst in tears in front of them or come up here?<eos> - I think I made the right choice. - Okay.<eos> At least I had a choice.<eos> What can I do to help you feel better?
Money guys like Zehner are the way to get to the kingpins.<eos> Just do your fucking job, Agent Petty.<eos> You...<eos> I'm just a fucking accountant.<eos> You're not just an accountant.<eos> - Scotty, did you get my prescription?<eos> - Yeah, it's on top of the microwave.<eos> Maybe it's not just work that's causing the stress.<eos> Well...<eos> Does it bother you that she's still here? No.
Because Mommy has a job interview.<eos> Go into my closet and get my boots,<eos> - next to my sneakers.<eos> That's it.<eos> Right there, sweetheart.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Thank you. Thank you, sweetheart.<eos> What's a job interview?<eos> A job interview is when... It's when we... When Mommy goes and she meets someone, and they ask her a lot of questions, like, where did she go to school and where she worked before.<eos> And they would be absolute morons not to hire you.

When Mommy goes and she meets someone, and they ask her a lot of questions, like, where did she go to school and where she worked before.<eos> And they would be absolute morons not to hire you.<eos> And if they like Mommy, they will give her money to work with them.<eos> But if you get a job, you won't be here as much.<eos> Oh, sweetheart... I will always be here for you.
But if you get a job, you won't be here as much.<eos> Oh, sweetheart... I will always be here for you.<eos> Even if you can't just reach out and touch me, you can always call me and I will always call you back. Okay?<eos> Such a mommy's girl.<eos> Okay, I need your help today.<eos> You're gonna have to look after Daddy, all right? Make sure that he's really good with Jonah.<eos> Okay.<eos> - You got this. - Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Love you, too.
Okay.<eos> - You got this. - Okay.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Love you, too.<eos> - I love you.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Right here. Right here!<eos> - Okay. Okay. Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> Here. I'll come pick you up. What time?
Love you, too.<eos> - I love you.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Right here. Right here!<eos> - Okay. Okay. Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> Here. I'll come pick you up. What time?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll manage.<eos> Love you.
Fine.<eos> Here. I'll come pick you up. What time?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll manage.<eos> Love you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey, girl.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Uh... - Come on in.<eos> - Do I know you, man?
- It's a thank you.<eos> - For? I looked through his portfolio.<eos> So why is this potential client not an actual client?<eos> Well, he says that he is in tile, and I don't know if he is. I don't...<eos> I don't know if it's, you know, Corleone with olive oil...<eos> I don't know.<eos> So, what, are you saying this guy's in the Mob?<eos> I don't know what the hell he is. But it's... it's honestly a thank you.<eos> And, um, the amount of money I saved him, the trip would just be a drop in the bucket.<eos> And what are you gonna do when he asks you to work for him again?
Does he still snore like a baby dinosaur?<eos> Ma, you can sleep outside in our tent, if you want.<eos> I put some earplugs on your nightstand.<eos> Oh, hey, where should I put your prescription?<eos> In the trash.<eos> I'll be fine with ibuprofen.<eos> What I really need is a porcelain toilet.<eos> If I see a bedpan again, I'm gonna scream.<eos> Ma, I... uh, okay.<eos> I put bars up in there for you.
Well, even if you... if we did do this, I mean... - it's not like you'd be stealing.<eos> - That's right.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> We can't... We can't do this.<eos> - Can we?<eos> - Why can't we do it?<eos> You really gonna do this?<eos> Are we gonna do this?<eos> Well...<eos> I'm good with it if you are.
Just so you can sleep.<eos> - I don't need 'em.<eos> - I know you're tough, Ma.<eos> Everyone in this world knows you're tough.<eos> You don't have to prove anything here.<eos> I said no.<eos> I don't want them.<eos> Look, there's no prizes for suffering.<eos> You just feel shitty.<eos> And I hate seeing you like this.
That's the one.<eos> All right.<eos> You want a high-capacity magazine with that?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Good call.<eos> Okay, you're all set.<eos> Have a Superstore day!<eos> I got it.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> - I'll call you later.
What is that?<eos> Well, it amounts to a confession.<eos> No, but why do you have it?<eos> I'm an FBI agent.<eos> And I have you on conspiracy to commit murder.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Class B felony in Missouri is five to 15 years...<eos> Fuck you talking about?<eos> I don't want you to serve that.<eos> I've got a way you don't have to.
- You saw it rigged.<eos> - It's not the same. - But she did it.<eos> - She told me she did it.<eos> - That's hearsay.<eos> Without real evidence, I need a confession.<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> - Here.<eos> Here, here, here. - I can't fucking breathe.<eos> Just drink some water.<eos> Fuck you, you faggot fuck!
- Here.<eos> Here, here, here. - I can't fucking breathe.<eos> Just drink some water.<eos> Fuck you, you faggot fuck!<eos> - You fucking turned me!<eos> - I...<eos> You fucking turned me!<eos> Get the fuck off me!<eos> Stay down!<eos> You think I just happened to be right next to you when I needed somebody who knew the lake? Huh?
Here, here, here. - I can't fucking breathe.<eos> Just drink some water.<eos> Fuck you, you faggot fuck!<eos> - You fucking turned me!<eos> - I...<eos> You fucking turned me!<eos> Get the fuck off me!<eos> Stay down!<eos> You think I just happened to be right next to you when I needed somebody who knew the lake? Huh?<eos> I found you.
Of course.<eos> I'll... I'll talk to Marty tonight.<eos> - Thanks. - Mm-hmm.<eos> You just let me back in until the end of the week.<eos> You gotta be fucking kidding me.<eos> Look, true or false? You have no idea what it is that I do or who I do it for.<eos> - That is not the point.<eos> - Right? You've never helped me and I will make sure you never would help me.<eos> You never signed anything. You never even handed me a goddamn pen.<eos> Which means there will be nothing to implicate you in whatever it is that I do, okay?

- Even so, I know that if the authorities caught me, if they busted me, they would try everything to link you to me, right?<eos> And it would be difficult for you to prove that you didn't conspire.<eos> Unless, of course, I made it very easy for you to prove your innocence.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Your iPhone?<eos> Give me my phone.<eos> Hold on. One second.<eos> Rachel... you let me back into the Blue Cat to finish my business, or I'm gonna come for you.<eos> You understand what I'm saying?<eos> I will kill you.

- Uh, yeah. I'll take a triple.<eos> Chili cheese fries.<eos> Ruth... wait a second.<eos> Look, I need to know what the plan is with Byrde.<eos> Dude, what's your deal?<eos> My deal is I wanna stop wiping other people's asses, finally.<eos> And Wyatt, Wy's smart, you know.<eos> He could go to college.<eos> You want him saddled with that debt?<eos> You know, you barely care if he goes to high school.
It's gotta be him.<eos> All right.<eos> I will give him a call.<eos> Hey, Jonah?<eos> What time is your dad getting back from the funeral?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How... How long are funerals, usually?<eos> I'll wait.<eos> I need you to get down here.<eos> There is a delivery for you.
Exit 112 near, uh... Morris, Illinois.<eos> I need you to be there with the kids at 2:00 p.m. Can you do that?<eos> - Wendy? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Say it back to me.<eos> I-80.<eos> Exit 112.<eos> Morris, Illinois. 2:00.<eos> We'll see you there.<eos> I love you.
You made us adults the second you told us about what Dad was doing.<eos> You can't take it all back now.<eos> I meant, I don't want Jonah to die.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, the second I become Mike Fleming... that means Jonah Byrde is dead.<eos> I don't want him to be dead.<eos> Hey.<eos> You ready?<eos> Yep.<eos> - I love you.
You can't take it all back now.<eos> I meant, I don't want Jonah to die.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, the second I become Mike Fleming... that means Jonah Byrde is dead.<eos> I don't want him to be dead.<eos> Hey.<eos> You ready?<eos> Yep.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you, too.
Who the fuck is Mr. Gilbert?<eos> He's Roy Gilbert.<eos> You don't fuck with this guy.<eos> I wanna fuck Roy Gilbert.<eos> And you.<eos> No, man.<eos> No, you...<eos> You didn't do nothing.<eos> You're just doing your job.<eos> You know, I'm gonna let you go, man.
- No.<eos> I pissed myself.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Um, where in the room exactly?<eos> - I don't remember. I don't remember.<eos> Everything went black, and then I just... I left.<eos> Yeah, well, that settles that.<eos> - Piss.<eos> - Why?<eos> I'm assuming you changed out of the clothes you were wearing?
So, half hour, tops?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> - All right.<eos> So, you'll be back in half an hour.<eos> Here, do me a favor.<eos> - I want your phone number. - Why?<eos> - Just write it down.<eos> - I'll just tell you.<eos> You need a reason for being here, okay?<eos> Marco called you to come over, so I'm gonna call you from that phone in about 20 minutes.
- Can I go home?<eos> Can you what?<eos> I gotta get a drink, man.<eos> I'm so thirsty, dude.<eos> Listen to me, you fucking asshole.<eos> You stay right where you are.<eos> Stay where you are, let me get there, and I promise I'll do everything I can to help you.<eos> But don't you fucking leave where you are right now, you hear me?<eos> Okay, great.<eos> I need you, John.
Please, please, please.<eos> - Meg?<eos> - No. No, no. I didn't tell Meg.<eos> She doesn't know shit.<eos> Kevin, does Mom know?<eos> I didn't know what else to do.<eos> I didn't have any other option.<eos> I was calling all night, but you weren't picking up.<eos> So, don't you fucking blame me, all right?<eos> I called you first.
It's where I called him from.<eos> I gotta call him...<eos> - Kevin.<eos> Kevin. - I gotta talk to my brother, man.<eos> - I don't... - I know, I know.<eos> Listen, listen.<eos> Let's just talk this through, okay?<eos> You came in, you saw somebody standing over the body.<eos> Whoever that was killed Marco.<eos> They saw you, they got scared, they ran. Who was it?
Yeah.<eos> And then I come in and he runs off.<eos> Yeah, it's not enough, though.<eos> So, what else?<eos> What if, um, you heard them arguing as you approached the house?<eos> Okay, yeah. They're yelling at each other when I got here.<eos> Right. Okay, that's good, but we gotta sell it better.<eos> So, let's go back. Um...<eos> And by the way, Kevin, this is all your choice, you know?<eos> If you weren't here, I can try to make that work, but if you were here... I could turn you into a hero.
And, uh...<eos> - we got you standing there.<eos> And then Eric sees you entering the house, he raises the gun.<eos> Yeah, maybe...<eos> Oh, yeah. That's good, yeah.<eos> What?<eos> That'll sell it, man.<eos> Prove there was another person in the room.<eos> How does him picking up the gun prove he's here?<eos> Because he shot you.
It's not supposed to be empty.<eos> Where am I supposed to get one in the middle of the night?<eos> Hospital.<eos> Okay.<eos> Call Chelsea.<eos> She isn't picking up.<eos> You need to go.<eos> - Hospital.<eos> - Ma, I...<eos> I love you. I can't fucking deal with this right now, okay?
You gotta hold this thing in your nose, put your hand up there.<eos> It'll be okay, okay?<eos> This is not my fault, okay?<eos> You're gonna keep calling Chelsea.<eos> It's gonna be good, okay?<eos> Just keep calling her, okay?<eos> You little cunt.<eos> I heard that, Mom.<eos> Come on, answer, you fucking fuckwad.<eos> Ozzy, I got your fucking payday for you, dude. I got John Rayburn served up to you like a pig on a fucking silver fucking stick.
Shit.<eos> - Ow. - Fuck.<eos> I told you to stand still.<eos> You...<eos> You fucking shot me, you bitch!<eos> You fucking shot me!<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Listen to me. Listen to me, okay?<eos> We don't have a lot of time.<eos> I didn't shoot you.
You...<eos> You fucking shot me, you bitch!<eos> You fucking shot me!<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Listen to me. Listen to me, okay?<eos> We don't have a lot of time.<eos> I didn't shoot you.<eos> You understand?<eos> - Get an ambulance.<eos> - Eric O'Bannon shot you after you heard yelling, after you surprised him and saw that he killed Detective Diaz.
Please record your voice message.<eos> Whatever you did... whatever happened, you better pray my son is gonna be all right.<eos> And fucking call me back, Roy.<eos> Hey.<eos> Meg.<eos> John?<eos> John, is that you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have you seen Kevin?<eos> I called you a million times.
He's not answering my calls.<eos> I only have his cell phone number.<eos> You don't have any other contact for him?<eos> I called his home.<eos> He's probably long gone by now, on his boat or his plane, or however he does it.<eos> Vanishing is his best talent.<eos> Where's Meg?<eos> She's not answering my calls either.<eos> - God, she's useless.<eos> - If you're dizzy, why don't you sit down?
- If you're dizzy, why don't you sit down?<eos> Place your head between your knees and sit down.<eos> Would you just stop ordering me around?<eos> I just need water.<eos> You want me to get you a glass of water, I'll get you water.<eos> If you have tightness in your chest... we need to call the doctor.<eos> I know everything, John.<eos> Meg told me all of it.<eos> And I don't wanna hear you making excuses for why you did what you did.<eos> I don't want you apologizing to me, or asking me to forgive you for anything you've done.
We're ready for you, Detective Rayburn.<eos> Go ahead. We'll talk later.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're stronger than you think.<eos> You're stronger than your family thinks.<eos> We're gonna get through this. And we're gonna have our baby.<eos> And we're gonna love him.<eos> And we're gonna keep him safe.<eos> And you're gonna watch him grow up.<eos> I love you.

- Wanna talk about what happened last night?<eos> - I know what happened last night. Do you?<eos> From what John said, you were too drunk to walk.<eos> - I was upset.<eos> - We needed you to give blood, Meg.<eos> - Well, I hadn't eaten. I fell asleep. - It was an emergency.<eos> Kevin almost died.<eos> - How was I supposed to know?<eos> - I asked you to find him.<eos> And you ended up in a bar, drinking all night.
He said we've run out of time, and then he fucking shot me.<eos> - Who? - The guy.<eos> - What guy?<eos> - The fucking guy.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Gilbert's guy.<eos> I've never seen...<eos> I never saw him before.<eos> He said he could make it all better.<eos> So, this guy shoots you.
Vodka, if I remember.<eos> I asked for your help, Roy.<eos> I didn't ask you to shoot my son.<eos> No good deed goes unpunished.<eos> Don't be an asshole.<eos> You almost killed him.<eos> You asked for my help, Sally.<eos> I gave it to you. Come on, Roy.<eos> I know you better than that.<eos> Robert dies, you buy into the boatyard, you're John's biggest campaign donor,

Come on, Roy.<eos> I know you better than that.<eos> Robert dies, you buy into the boatyard, you're John's biggest campaign donor,<eos> - you give Meg legal work?<eos> - Most people would thank me.<eos> Most people don't know you like I do.

Right now we're kind of in it together.<eos> Sell me the boatyard.<eos> Now, even if I was inclined, and I'm not, that's really up to Kevin.<eos> Kevin will do what I tell him.<eos> That's been Kevin's problem, don't you think?<eos> You...<eos> You jealous fuck.<eos> You've always wanted what Robert had.<eos> Well, you can't have it, Roy.<eos> I'll see you dead before that happens.
No, Meg.<eos> He knew.<eos> He knew everything.<eos> I didn't have... a choice<eos> You and me, Kevin... we're done.<eos> You and me... no more going along with the ride.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> You're on your own.<eos> Fuck you!
Fuck you!<eos> Hey, Eric.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, asshole.<eos> - Easy, easy.<eos> - Fuck! - I'm here by myself.<eos> - Get out of here!<eos> - I just wanna talk.<eos> - Get the fuck out!<eos> I know you're scared, but if they find you here,
- Easy, easy.<eos> - Fuck! - I'm here by myself.<eos> - Get out of here!<eos> - I just wanna talk.<eos> - Get the fuck out!<eos> I know you're scared, but if they find you here,<eos> - you know what's gonna happen? - I didn't kill Marco.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Listen really closely.<eos> - We've got a witness that saw you there...
Now, I'm just here...<eos> I'm just here to give you the opportunity... to protect yourself.<eos> Easy.<eos> Easy.<eos> Is it loaded?<eos> It's too bad.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Marco's head was smashed to shit.<eos> Did you do that?<eos> Fuck you, he was my goddamn partner.
Detective Marco Diaz... our friend... your brother... and your son.<eos> My partner.<eos> Family.<eos> Coming.<eos> Wow, you look like you've been up all night.<eos> I still have a job.<eos> Thanks for coming over.<eos> Is she still here?<eos> No, they've... They're at school already.<eos> Listen, I didn't wanna call you, but I didn't know what else to do, so...
My God.<eos> Crazy woman.<eos> - Why am I signing this again?<eos> - Character.<eos> Takes a man of real character to petition that the fella who shot him be allowed to attend his mother's funeral.<eos> Maybe a photographer will be there, sell the story to the Keys Gazette.<eos> Jury sees it, they know who to trust.<eos> You told me it wasn't gonna go to trial, Roy.<eos> I'm still confident of that.<eos> You just stick to the plan.
- And I have to study.<eos> Study what?<eos> These, um, transcripts.<eos> These trial transcripts.<eos> So I can be better at testifying.<eos> - Come back when you're done.<eos> - I will.<eos> Let me go.<eos> I'll be back in a bit.<eos> I love you.
- Absolutely not.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Hey. You got a minute?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, that pissing match back there between you and the boss, that about him or me?<eos> That's about him, 100%.<eos> So, you guys are just gonna be assholes from now on?<eos> Or you gonna grow up, put the sheriff's race behind you?<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah, you're better off anyway.
Take a step back, get some perspective, get your mind right.<eos> Like you?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Why the fuck not like me?<eos> I'm sick of you looking down on me my whole life.<eos> Okay?<eos> You remember that word Dad used to use all the time?<eos> Disappointment.<eos> Why are you so upset about this?
Who is it?<eos> It's me.<eos> I've had too much to drink.<eos> Did you drive here?<eos> No, I caught a cab.<eos> I don't think the kids should see me like this.<eos> Get in here.<eos> You're so serious!<eos> Get in here.<eos> I love you.
Oh, Meg.<eos> Honey, are you all right?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I won't ask questions.<eos> I should know better.<eos> I'm feeling kind of foolish if this isn't you, if this is just dead air.<eos> I'm making a complete fool of myself.<eos> Oh, Meg.<eos> I love you, Meg.
Oh, no, no.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I won't ask questions.<eos> I should know better.<eos> I'm feeling kind of foolish if this isn't you, if this is just dead air.<eos> I'm making a complete fool of myself.<eos> Oh, Meg.<eos> I love you, Meg.<eos> That's all.<eos> I love you.
I'm sorry.<eos> I won't ask questions.<eos> I should know better.<eos> I'm feeling kind of foolish if this isn't you, if this is just dead air.<eos> I'm making a complete fool of myself.<eos> Oh, Meg.<eos> I love you, Meg.<eos> That's all.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I miss you.
What the fuck is going on?<eos> You're going slow.<eos> It's my mom's fucking funeral, dude.<eos> "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth.<eos> For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.<eos> And I saw a holy city coming down from heaven. A new Jerusalem."<eos> - Why the fuck are we stopped?<eos> - Transmission's shot.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, fuck you.
Well...<eos> - if you ever wanna talk about it.<eos> Even better.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Keep your fucking eyes off it.<eos> You're flooding it, man.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> One of the things we learned under Fidel... how to fix cars.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Mom. I need to ask you a favor.
- Would you excuse us?<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> I'll be right in.<eos> Roy, I gotta get going.<eos> Listen, Roy, I'm sorry, but...<eos> You remember I told you I wanted you to take on more responsibility?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - This isn't just about the boatyard.<eos> You understand?<eos> Now, I will never ask you to do something that you don't wanna do.
- What's going on?<eos> - It's a gift.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - It's a gift.<eos> More of an acknowledgment.<eos> It's from Roy.<eos> Are you shitting me?<eos> - That's from...?<eos> Are you shitting me?<eos> - It's for you!
Six-point-two liter engine.<eos> Should pull any boat you want.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But you really didn't have to do that.<eos> You probably know by now, Kevin, I don't do much I don't want to do.<eos> I heard you had some excitement out on the water today.<eos> Uh, yeah. You could say that.<eos> The boys want to make it up to you tonight.<eos> Take you out on the town.
- Fuck do I know?<eos> Hands on the gate.<eos> South Carolina's shaped like the sweet patootie of the first girl that ever showed me one.<eos> Okay, buddy, here we go.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Here we go.<eos> We're gonna go see Grandma.<eos> - Mom, you in there?<eos> - Yeah, honey.<eos> Somebody wants to see you.
They're gonna accept the plea.<eos> They are?<eos> Really?<eos> Really?<eos> So, it's over?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you so much. Thank you so much! - Oh!<eos> - Oh, Kevin. Please.<eos> Put me down.<eos> - I love you, I love you, I love you.
- Oh, Kevin. Please.<eos> Put me down.<eos> - I love you, I love you, I love you.<eos> - What did you say to her?<eos> - I told her the truth.<eos> Some of it.<eos> Did you hear that, Rock? Did you hear this?<eos> We got such good news.<eos> Maybe Meg will come home now.<eos> Daddy loves you.
- You just described everyone in here.<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> I know what you mean.<eos> So, what are we drinking?<eos> Uh, can I get a bottle of Patrón please for those three idiots over there?<eos> And, uh, just a Coke for me.<eos> - Wow, you did clean your act up.<eos> - I'm trying, Sheryl. I'm trying.<eos> I'll get that Patrón.<eos> - Good to see you.
You don't have to worry about me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - What the fuck happened?<eos> - It was a disagreement.<eos> This piece of shit stabbed him.<eos> What the fuck did you do? !<eos> You okay, man?<eos> He was trying to get him to stop touching me.<eos> Whatever that costs, we're gonna take care of it, okay?<eos> Fuck you!
You feel like a big man now, huh, John?<eos> You better watch it.<eos> I'm not who you think I am.<eos> I forgot to tell you that Eric O'Bannon, he changed his mind.<eos> He dropped the plea deal.<eos> The case is gonna go to trial.<eos> He changed his mind?<eos> You said you were gonna fix it.<eos> Well, now there's the Kevin that I know.<eos> You are exactly who I think you are.
Loving the pink ropes, buddy.<eos> Right?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Let's go find the dressing room.<eos> Just follow me.<eos> Well...<eos> - You don't have Clue?<eos> My mom doesn't like games where people get killed.<eos> Monopoly might be better.<eos> Justine? Uh, someone is here to see you.
- I'll take some coffee.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> I called the pizza place. I ordered a pizza.<eos> I shook down the kid who brought it, and he sang like a canary.<eos> So, you must be the famous Billy.<eos> Relax with the standing and sticking your chest out.<eos> I'm just here to talk.<eos> I don't have anything to say to you.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I tried to fuck you, okay?
If you'd told me you were my daughter, I would never have done that.<eos> Milk?<eos> Sugar?<eos> Oh, uh, black.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, this is my fault.<eos> Look, I get that there's no great way to deliver this news, okay?<eos> But coming out here and pretending to audition for a show that I'm directing, and then following me around like some crazed fangirl, I mean, definitely, you know, made it, you know, worse.<eos> That's all I'm saying.<eos> I just... wanted to meet you.
- No.<eos> I brought my tuxedo.<eos> I... I was born for this moment.<eos> Great.<eos> - Uh, so, I wrote all your lines...<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I'll probably embroider these a tad, but, uh...<eos> Since when does this thing end with a tag-team match?<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, don't let anyone see you.
And it looks like evil's winning today.<eos> Go back to the Middle East, dune coon.<eos> We've got a beer drinker here tonight, folks.<eos> - Fuck you! - That's okay.<eos> We're having a good time.<eos> What the fuck is your problem, man?<eos> Y'all got to go.<eos> - Screw you.<eos> - You don't want me to come out.<eos> I will fuck you up, baldy.

It helps.<eos> Or I could take one of Bash's Quaaludes.<eos> He offered.<eos> Our third match tonight is a doozy.<eos> Beauty versus the Beast.<eos> From the neon streets of Hollywood, weighing in at 103 pounds...<eos> - I love my fans.<eos> - Say hello to Melrose!<eos> Don't fucking drop me.<eos> I think I love you!

Goodness prevails.<eos> Justice has been restored.<eos> I won!<eos> Yes!<eos> What are these camera guys doing?<eos> You're in each other's shots. Get...<eos> Just...<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Next time maybe you should give them some direction.<eos> Yeah, well, next time... don't fucking run away so I have to come looking for you when I'm supposed to be directing a goddamn television show.
You weak, geriatrical-type person.<eos> And so far it's just insults.<eos> Let's see if this cold war will start heating up soon.<eos> - I don't feel like wrestling.<eos> - I wrestled last time.<eos> Looks like the Biddies are deciding who will fight first. Oh!<eos> Zoya the Destroya and Fortune Cookie have pounced on their opponents.<eos> The rules have gone completely out the window.<eos> Wow, these girls are really disrespecting the elderly.<eos> - I love you, but not that much.
The rules have gone completely out the window.<eos> Wow, these girls are really disrespecting the elderly.<eos> - I love you, but not that much.<eos> - This is dumb!<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> Biddies are making a comeback.<eos> Their osteoporosis is in remission, and they're on the attack.<eos> - You're a very bad girl.<eos> - No spanking, come on.<eos> I got you. I got you now.
Russia's not sharing that crown with anyone.<eos> Please.<eos> You love to hate me.<eos> - Boo! - Russia is supreme world leader!<eos> And here comes the crown.<eos> I am victorious.<eos> No one can defeat Zoya.<eos> Everyone here is too much sissy.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'll fight you.
- Boo! - Russia is supreme world leader!<eos> And here comes the crown.<eos> I am victorious.<eos> No one can defeat Zoya.<eos> Everyone here is too much sissy.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'll fight you.<eos> - Who's that yelling from the audience?<eos> - You heard me.<eos> I said, I'll fight you.
Yeah. Yeah, I just feel like the walls are closing in a little bit.<eos> Yeah. I know what you mean.<eos> I just-<eos> - I get this urge. It just flares up, you know, like I wanna get the hell out of here.<eos> We really need to get a place of our own, huh?<eos> I'll put a call into Topher first thing.<eos> He owes me. Well, he hasn't returned any of your other calls.<eos> Oh, it's a delicate thing.<eos> You know, he's probably waiting until they break ground on the hotel.<eos> Well, maybe you should go in there, you know, in person?
No, I'm glad that I got rid of the store.<eos> I mean, sure, I feel bad for the people who came to rely on it, but...<eos> I'm sorry, what do you mean by "everything"?<eos> Nothing, I just-- no, I meant that because everything changes so quickly in Venice, you know.<eos> - And I don't want you to be surprised.<eos> - It's only been a couple of months.<eos> Almost four.<eos> I wanna go back to the way we had it.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, what can I do for you?
I really just need somewhere to-- somewhere to stay.<eos> Oh, man. You should talk to my landlord.<eos> - Man, he's the most accommodating dude.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Yeah. He's always telling me he's got like, a line of people that he wants to get in here.<eos> You should get on line, Chip!<eos> He is a real coolio too.<eos> Like, I haven't paid rent in like, three or six different months.<eos> So, I mean, that's one thing.<eos> But, you should hurry, because he said that rents are gonna skyrocket soon because of the new hotel going.
- Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Hi. - Hey.<eos> - Rosa, right?<eos> - Bryan, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No. No, I'm Dennis.<eos> You're joking with me.<eos> Right.<eos> Uh, hey, look. Sorry about earlier. I hope I didn't freak you out.
Hi. - Hey.<eos> - Rosa, right?<eos> - Bryan, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No. No, I'm Dennis.<eos> You're joking with me.<eos> Right.<eos> Uh, hey, look. Sorry about earlier. I hope I didn't freak you out.<eos> I was taking your mail to you and then you told me to dance, and you just seemed really into it, so I just--<eos> I didn't wanna disappoint you, is all.
- You're in fucking AA?<eos> Uh... "Easy does it"?<eos> - I mean, is that even helpful?<eos> - Oh, well, no.<eos> - That's not mine. That's a--<eos> - No? No, that's a friend, actually.<eos> Well, ex-friend of mine.<eos> Yeah. He used to live here.<eos> When we were friends.<eos> Let me guess, he let you down?
And you didn't do that for a broken heart.<eos> None of that was for a noble cause.<eos> It got you laid, and you liked the attention.<eos> You liked being the Mayor of Venice.<eos> Well, sorry, man.<eos> That's-- that's all over now.<eos> Uh... hey, man, I know this is a bit of a long shot, but...<eos> I couldn't stay in the guest house could I, tonight?<eos> Just for tonight, as I sort a few things out?<eos> I'm doing this for you, man.
Well, sorry, man.<eos> That's-- that's all over now.<eos> Uh... hey, man, I know this is a bit of a long shot, but...<eos> I couldn't stay in the guest house could I, tonight?<eos> Just for tonight, as I sort a few things out?<eos> I'm doing this for you, man.<eos> I haven't had a drink since the last time I saw you.<eos> This morning?<eos> No, man. Four months ago.<eos> Good for you, man.
Well, if everything stays on schedule and the trial starts tomorrow, it should take four, maybe five days.<eos> Hi.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I came by to give you this.<eos> - I don't want your family's money.<eos> - It's not my family's, it's my dad's.<eos> - Thanks, but I don't want that either.<eos> - It's for Eric. All the money in the world won't help Eric.<eos> - My dad would've figured out a way.<eos> - He would've wanted you to get a haircut.
Seven. Oh, that's good for me, then.<eos> Why?<eos> Why does that matter?<eos> I was thinking about it.<eos> Marco was really, you know, a pretty good-looking guy, right?<eos> Women respond to that, so it's better for me if there's more men.<eos> Um... listen, babe, I gotta go.<eos> But let me know how it goes with Santos, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Love you.
What's up?<eos> Now, the prosecution is gonna suggest that Eric O'Bannon, on the verge of being offered an immunity deal from the state's attorney in regard to a potential investigation, decided to go on a killing spree. To attack Marco Diaz, a man for whom Eric had no provable ill will, and then try to shoot and kill Kevin Rayburn.<eos> Kevin Rayburn has known Eric all of his life.<eos> Kevin Rayburn is the younger brother of Eric's best and dearest friend.<eos> In all seriousness, we want this squared up, keep morale high with a conviction.<eos> I understand that.<eos> So, when you on?<eos> Tomorrow, probably.<eos> Okay, well, keep me posted.<eos> Anything we can do for you.
He's talking all kinds of shit, and I...<eos> He wanted me to call you.<eos> You won't take his calls.<eos> And I wanna do right by him, you know?<eos> Isn't there anything you can do to help him?<eos> Now?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> He seems to think that you're intentionally trying to hurt him.<eos> I...<eos> I know you, John.
Never seen this.<eos> You want it?<eos> No, Chelsea, I don't want it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> I don't know what else to do.<eos> Please, help him, John.<eos> You're not responsible for your mother's actions, Nolan.<eos> I know, but you should take it.<eos> She stole from you... and I'd feel better.
Oh, yes.<eos> Any questions?<eos> Concerns?<eos> No.<eos> I'll see you in the morning.<eos> The fucking whole roof comes off.<eos> Danny, I'm just saying that your family, they just...<eos> They don't give a fucking shit about you, man.<eos> Fuck your family, fuck the fucking Rayburns.<eos> They hate you, man.
You didn't have to kill Ambassador Rafel.<eos> You didn't have to kill Pike.<eos> Pike got what he deserved.<eos> Justice and vengeance are not the same thing.<eos> To me, they are.<eos> Your decision-making has grown increasingly questionable, and I can't have my people going rogue.<eos> "Rogue." I'm a warrior.<eos> No.<eos> A warrior knows when not to kill.<eos> Lincoln taught you that.

Why?<eos> What's the penalty for crossing the line?<eos> - Run!<eos> - Run!<eos> I thought you said A.L.I.E. was down.<eos> She is.<eos> It's probably automated.<eos> Raven.<eos> I can't keep up.<eos> I got you.
- You can't help him.<eos> - Nyko.<eos> Nyko!<eos> - It's too late.<eos> No.<eos> Nyko.<eos> - Luna, take cover!<eos> - Nyko.<eos> No! No!<eos> Well, that took you 10 shots.
- Monty, it...<eos> - Don't.<eos> Just... don't.<eos> Indra.<eos> No.<eos> Indra.<eos> Indr...<eos> Skairipa...<eos> Monty...<eos> Jasper's fine, in case you cared.
The Clarke I know wouldn't be arresting her friends.<eos> Kane agreed that we needed to keep this quiet.<eos> Kane isn't here.<eos> That's just an excuse.<eos> You're the one saying, you live and Harper dies.<eos> You're the one shock-batoning Jasper, then arresting him.<eos> You're the one going too far and using the same old justification...<eos> "it's all for my people."<eos> It is.<eos> I know you think people will freak out, but if you just tell everyone the truth, maybe they'll surprise you.
Worry about your damn self.<eos> Luna no!<eos> You'll get killed!<eos> Luna's here.<eos> She's heading for the boat.<eos> Copy that, Raven.<eos> Do whatever you can to stop her.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> Screw it.<eos> I can't let you leave.
Luna no!<eos> You'll get killed!<eos> Luna's here.<eos> She's heading for the boat.<eos> Copy that, Raven.<eos> Do whatever you can to stop her.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> Screw it.<eos> I can't let you leave.<eos> We need you.
Go!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> You're up.<eos> Still taking fire.<eos> We're almost there.<eos> Save your friends.<eos> I just need to access its core programming.<eos> The drones are protecting A.L.I.E.'s facilities like guard dogs.<eos> Can you stop them?<eos> We need you, Abby.
Over here.<eos> - Abby...<eos> Abby, run!<eos> The drones just fell out of the sky.<eos> What happened?<eos> I happened.<eos> Now get your asses back to the boat.<eos> Luna's here. Over.<eos> Luna.<eos> It's not your blood that defines you.
Good?<eos> Good?<eos> Then it's settled.<eos> Now, that radiation shield is ready.<eos> Who's gonna help me put it in place?<eos> Let's get it done.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Helping.<eos> I'm not trying to undermine you, Clarke.
We can't tell people they have no value.<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> That's what they heard.<eos> The list was pragmatic, but the people need to feel like they have a say in their fate.<eos> I hope you're right.<eos> Faster, Helios!<eos> Stop her!<eos> It's over, Octavia.<eos> Don't fight it.<eos> Roan wants you alive.
Stop her!<eos> It's over, Octavia.<eos> Don't fight it.<eos> Roan wants you alive.<eos> Come quietly.<eos> That'll happen.<eos> Doesn't have to be this way.<eos> It does.<eos> You made sure of that.<eos> I said, I wanted you alive.

Adrian, are you okay?<eos> I'm dizzy.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> When was the last time you evaded a carjacking, asshole?<eos> Nobody move.<eos> Oh Shit!<eos> Get the door!<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Watch the glass.<eos> I got you.

Wait!<eos> The guns!<eos> Mia.<eos> - Mia.<eos> - You're not real.<eos> You're not...<eos> You're not real.<eos> It's just...<eos> That's, uh...<eos> I miss you, baby doll.
You shouldn't go alone.<eos> - Clint, please.<eos> - I'm going with her.<eos> The security office.<eos> It's going to be okay.<eos> Going to be fine.<eos> - It's gonna be okay.<eos> - I know.<eos> I want you to stay with Kimmi until I get back.<eos> I just need to know you'll be watched after right now.

Hey, hey!<eos> No underage drinking.<eos> Come on.<eos> You of all people should know what it can lead to.<eos> We should get some sleep.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> "Baby doll."<eos> What?<eos> The old lady outside... she called you her baby doll.
There's only one variable that separates Luna from the others.<eos> Nightblood.<eos> I should be going to the island to make Nightblood.<eos> If Jaha's right and Becca created Nightblood there, they'll find her records, and all they have to do is reverse-engineer it from Luna, and everyone lives.<eos> If they can get it done before the radiation gets here.<eos> I guess we'd better finish the ship.<eos> They told us that you have a Nightblood.<eos> Nightblood helps metabolize radiation.<eos> We're investigating ways to create it for everyone so we can all survive.<eos> Roan wants you alive.
What is it?<eos> They thought they had the element of surprise, but we did.<eos> Someone warned them.<eos> You think it was Octavia?<eos> She's alive.<eos> I have to warn them.<eos> You did.<eos> Skaikru soldiers went to meet Roan's army.<eos> How did I get here?<eos> A man brought you...

We have to go to space and make Nightblood.<eos> It's a... it's a two-seater, by the way.<eos> I drive.<eos> You cook.<eos> Sound like a plan?<eos> - What?<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> Heightened mental ability, hallucinations, euphoria, headaches...<eos> it's all connected.<eos> A.L.I.E. warned you that the EMP would cause brain damage.
Becca's mind was in that code.<eos> That's why you knew where the rocket was.<eos> Yes...<eos> And now I need to learn how to fly this thing.<eos> Wait.<eos> Raven, your brain scan showed evidence of a stroke.<eos> I'm afraid that if you keep pushing like this, it's just gonna make things worse.<eos> I've been through worse, Doc.<eos> Not worse than this.<eos> Raven, it could kill you.
Could or... will?<eos> So, what, I survive long enough for everyone else to die?<eos> I can't do that, Abby.<eos> Even if it costs me my life... you have to let me go.<eos> Abby, wait.<eos> Why haven't you had any symptoms?<eos> They used the EMP on you, too.<eos> Because we both know that brain trauma can induce entirely different symptoms in different people.<eos> Still, Abby, we have to scan your brain, too.<eos> I'll let you know if I have any headaches, ok?
If you fire, he will.<eos> Riley, Riley, listen to me.<eos> Pulling that trigger won't end anything.<eos> Kane and Monty will be executed, and our side will open fire.<eos> It'll be a bloodbath.<eos> You're a prisoner.<eos> You're just saying what they want you to say.<eos> I know all about that.<eos> I'm done with this.<eos> Move, or I'll kill you, too.

What makes you so sure he's still here?<eos> You didn't see him in Polis.<eos> He was on a mission to destroy tech.<eos> It was no coincidence he found me on my way here.<eos> He used me to get in.<eos> This whole ship is tech.<eos> Where would you go to do the most damage?<eos> The server room.<eos> This way.<eos> I got you.
She was in medbay.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> - There.<eos> There.<eos> - O. O.<eos> O. O!<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Go.<eos> I got you.

I got you. I got you.<eos> Ok.<eos> O.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, are you ok?<eos> I'm ok.<eos> - Help Octavia.<eos> - Ok.<eos> Monty, take Niylah.<eos> I got you.
- Can I come in?<eos> Of course.<eos> You got everything you need?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm having trouble sleeping.<eos> Oh, I keep having these dreams.<eos> I dreamed I was at a funeral in the middle of a river, and... people all brought the same flowers.<eos> Tiger lilies.<eos> I...<eos> I wanna ask you something.
Tiger lilies.<eos> I...<eos> I wanna ask you something.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's about Meg.<eos> - What about her?<eos> - Have you talked to Meg, Mom?<eos> Have you had any contact with her?<eos> How many times are you...?<eos> I'm gonna keep asking you about it, because if she doesn't come back here, they're gonna make her a suspect.
I don't know. A few months.<eos> Ever since she gave me free drinks at the bar the night my dad died. Heh.<eos> What a horrible accident.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> No, no, I mean, how her folks passed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Amy and I have, um...<eos> You know, we've really bonded over being parentless.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure you have.<eos> Anyway... just really nice to meet you, John.
You must have impressed Judge Reens, too, because she's considering our motion for a stay.<eos> Yeah? How long until we know?<eos> Well, she didn't say, "Fuck you," but it's still a long shot, so you need to be ready to testify.<eos> I am.<eos> You'll be up first, and we'll swing big from the start.<eos> Day after tomorrow, if the Honorable Judge Reens denies us.<eos> Sure, okay.<eos> Do you think it would help if I testify?<eos> In relation to what?<eos> We don't want you getting mixed up in this.

But you could rebut that.<eos> You could give Meg a human face.<eos> I'll get back to you, Mr. Marx.<eos> How does it feel to be 35 again?<eos> It's a great excuse to have a party.<eos> And since when do you like parties?<eos> Since my family is not at them.<eos> I got your message.<eos> I'm not coming home.<eos> You realize that Eric's defense is attempting to make you a suspect?
I said, I got the message.<eos> I mean, I thought at least once you heard that you could at least... give me a fucking call or something.<eos> Why?<eos> I knew you would track me down.<eos> You don't care what people are saying?<eos> I don't want any part of it.<eos> If they can't find me, they cannot force me to testify.<eos> What about Mom?<eos> What about Mom?<eos> Don't you think that Mom needs you?
I was hiking up the hill.<eos> I saw him sitting in his car.<eos> I think he might have been crying.<eos> - When was that?<eos> - I passed him on the way up. On the way down, he was still there.<eos> I left my phone in the car, so I couldn't call sooner.<eos> Where?<eos> Hey.<eos> What's up?<eos> LC said she saw you.
The same one, since we were kids.<eos> There's someone that's coming down the driveway at the inn.<eos> And they're trying to break into the house, and I can't lock the doors.<eos> They won't lock.<eos> I mean, the locks are there, but I...<eos> They won't work.<eos> And then I wake up right before I see who the person is.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I probably sound crazy.<eos> I don't think you're crazy.
Kevin...<eos> Kevin's told me he's had a dream very similar to that.<eos> What about you?<eos> - What about me?<eos> - You ever have it?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Would it really help if I came home?<eos> It probably would.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> Have you ever felt like you knew something... deep down inside... but if you actually said it out loud, people would think you were crazy?
From 11 on.<eos> She was asleep by midnight.<eos> - Why didn't you mention this to anybody?<eos> - Nobody asked me.<eos> Mrs. Rayburn, I'm sorry.<eos> Please help me to understand.<eos> You had this information and you never came forward?<eos> My daughter... is not on trial for murdering Marco Diaz, Ms. Santos.<eos> Your client is.<eos> Fuck you.
I know what you've done for all of us.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> You can't plead guilty.<eos> You should have seen how they fucking looked at her.<eos> It's like she was the Virgin fucking Mary up there weeping.<eos> It doesn't mean anything.<eos> She's a mom crying.<eos> They're gonna feel bad for a minute and...<eos> Doesn't mean they're gonna find you guilty.
Jesus, I...<eos> I can't imagine what...<eos> What you went through.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I just... thought maybe it'd help.<eos> It wasn't true.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Don't you think I would've told you that by now?<eos> And just so we're clear,<eos> I didn't do it for you or for Kevin.
- I'm not going to fucking dinner, Mike. I don't give a fuck that you and Diana are having some troubles, all right?<eos> It's called a marriage. You... You put your pants on, act like an adult,<eos> - have dinner with your friends. - I'm not going to dinner with Diana.<eos> - Yeah, you are.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> Did you ever come to visit me?<eos> No. Do I got a problem with that?<eos> No. But if you ever found me in a place like this, some lonely as fuck motel, would you just leave me there?<eos> No, you wouldn't, because that would be a shitty thing to do to a friend.<eos> Look, I'm gonna come and pick you up.
But, uh... there have been some hitches in the deal.<eos> I need you to help.<eos> I don't know, Roy.<eos> I'm finally free of all that shit, you know?<eos> Well, of course.<eos> You wouldn't have to do anything... you're uncomfortable about.<eos> I mean, I wouldn't put you in that position.<eos> But this project here... could be worth millions.<eos> And you'd have a substantial piece of that.<eos> The Cubans loved you, Kevin.
Honey, you okay?<eos> Ever since, I've been waiting for the other shoe to drop.<eos> It's like I can't... trust happiness because I know it could be taken away any second.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> I've been so happy with you and Rocky.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> What kind of question is that?<eos> You know I love you.<eos> Of course I love you.
Hey, hey.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> I've been so happy with you and Rocky.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> What kind of question is that?<eos> You know I love you.<eos> Of course I love you.<eos> What would I have to do for you to leave me?<eos> I don't know what you're asking me.<eos> I'm not gonna leave you.

You're hungry.<eos> Let me get dinner started, okay?<eos> Did you kill Marco?<eos> - What?<eos> - You lied on the stand.<eos> I found the papers with your... - made-up testimony that you memorized.<eos> - Belle.<eos> That's all over now, okay?<eos> It's not... over for me, Kevin.<eos> I'm leaving you... unless you tell me the truth.
Telling you, not gonna give you that, just gonna say, "one year."<eos> All right then. Enough shop talk.<eos> Let's make a toast to tomorrow.<eos> To tomorrows.<eos> And to you guys for having us back here every single year and to the first day... - of lobster season. - Of lobster season.<eos> - There we go.<eos> - Hear, hear.<eos> Okay, honey.<eos> We're just finishing dinner with Mike and Vonnie.<eos> Love you too.
- "Girl?"<eos> - Oh, jeez.<eos> Twenty-three years, I still can't get away with anything with you.<eos> You guys seem like you're doing good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good decision to move away, huh?<eos> I know I make it sound like it was my decision, but, I mean, it was Vonnie. She pretty much gave me an ultimatum.<eos> She's like, "We're gonna move or you're gonna find a new wife." So, uh...<eos> But she told me.<eos> She said, "Job's not for you."

You know this family's never gonna let you on the inside.
- Yes. You know this family's never gonna let you on the inside.<eos> - They're my family too at this point.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Best thing you can do for John... is for you guys to get as far away from here as possible.<eos> You're a beautiful woman.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> - What's up with you tonight?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Every time I see you, you just look better and better.
- Okay, okay.<eos> Listen.<eos> Fuck. Okay, here's what I can offer you.<eos> And this is my final offer.<eos> We'll lock that price in for ten runs.<eos> - That's the best I can do.<eos> - No.<eos> Mateo was right.<eos> We came for nothing.<eos> Fuck you.
Christ, it's gonna clog up your body and your mind.<eos> You gotta stay focused, little brother.<eos> Focus, man.<eos> You see anything today?<eos> Anything for me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Like what?<eos> What the fuck I should do with my fucking family now?<eos> No.<eos> Nothing about you.
- I will.<eos> Front door was open.<eos> Oh, we don't lock it.<eos> Ever?<eos> Not during business hours.<eos> I wasn't sure you'd come.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I saw you at the courthouse.
Good.<eos> Maybe I'd get a dog too.<eos> I'd go to school.<eos> Oh, that sounds like a great idea.<eos> What would you study?<eos> Cooking.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> I liked cooking with my dad.<eos> So...<eos> I have something for you.
Hey, hey.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Too mean to die.<eos> And when I go, they won't be naming any piers after me.<eos> Probably not.<eos> Remember Hearst?<eos> He ran an empire.<eos> When he died, everybody wanted to know how much he left behind.<eos> The answer was all of it.<eos> Who you got to take care of you?
Probably not.<eos> Remember Hearst?<eos> He ran an empire.<eos> When he died, everybody wanted to know how much he left behind.<eos> The answer was all of it.<eos> Who you got to take care of you?<eos> Kevin's been here.<eos> I've been thinking a lot about Robert lately.<eos> He knew exactly what he wanted.<eos> He found you and he built it.
He knew exactly what he wanted.<eos> He found you and he built it.<eos> Yeah, he did.<eos> I only knew what I didn't want.<eos> There's nothing wrong with that, Roy.<eos> Everybody changes.<eos> Never changed for me.<eos> I didn't wanna be responsible for anyone.<eos> I didn't want it.<eos> In some ways... I envy you, Sally.
Yeah, he did.<eos> I only knew what I didn't want.<eos> There's nothing wrong with that, Roy.<eos> Everybody changes.<eos> Never changed for me.<eos> I didn't wanna be responsible for anyone.<eos> I didn't want it.<eos> In some ways... I envy you, Sally.<eos> The only thing you ever cared about... was your family.<eos> For you... it was simple.
- Only two came back.<eos> My fault.<eos> - Robert didn't have anything to do with...<eos> - I know that.<eos> - And you didn't need to do what you did.<eos> - I had no choice.<eos> - You could have turned me in. - Robert was with you.<eos> Still.<eos> No, we did what we had to do, Roy.<eos> - Yeah, you were wrong.

Well, I definitely said<eos> - something I shouldn't have.<eos> - What?<eos> John, listen to me, okay?<eos> I'm coming clean, and I'm sorry.<eos> I am sorry from the bottom of my fucking heart, but the last time we were here, I kissed Diana.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> That's why we didn't come back,<eos> - that's why I can't face you...<eos> - Fuck you.
- Fuck you.<eos> She told me about that.<eos> You knew about it?<eos> What the fuck are you doing down here, Mike?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What the fuck is it you're not telling me?<eos> - Don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - Aguirre.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Saw you in the parking lot with Aguirre.
Drowning.<eos> Well, I was diving.<eos> I... might have gone too far.<eos> No, sir.<eos> At Elbow Reef.<eos> We all know that's not true.<eos> I was diving with my friend Mike.<eos> Mr. Rayburn.<eos> I can only tell you what they told me.<eos> You said some things after you were resuscitated.
Mike Gallagher.<eos> Mike Gallagher's in town.<eos> Do you work with him?<eos> We went to the academy together.<eos> We've known each other for 25...<eos> - He was at my wedding. Mikey.<eos> - That does not sound familiar.<eos> It's Mike...<eos> Look. All we did is we went out and had dinner last night.<eos> Me, Mikey, Vonnie, and, you'll be happy to know, Diana.

John, you need to rest.<eos> Where are they?<eos> - They were there.<eos> - You've been through quite an ordeal.<eos> - They were there. Where did they go?<eos> - John, you need to take it easy.<eos> Hey, John.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Mom had to go help Kevin out.<eos> She asked me to come get you.
She asked me to come get you.<eos> Where'd the doctor go?<eos> Are you okay, brother?<eos> Easy, man.<eos> Easy.<eos> Okay, John, just calm down.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Calm down, baby brother. Okay?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll take you home.
Why are we here?<eos> - Where?<eos> - Here.<eos> - The inn?<eos> - Why did you bring me here?<eos> It's home.<eos> Who lives here now?<eos> Seriously, John?<eos> Mom's still alive?<eos> Yeah. Mom's waiting in there for you.
- Where?<eos> - Here.<eos> - The inn?<eos> - Why did you bring me here?<eos> It's home.<eos> Who lives here now?<eos> Seriously, John?<eos> Mom's still alive?<eos> Yeah. Mom's waiting in there for you.<eos> Everyone's in there waiting for you.
What happened?<eos> Go on inside and you'll find out.<eos> Are you coming with me?<eos> I gotta work.<eos> Work?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - What work are you capable of?<eos> - "Work" work.<eos> It's always been your excuse.<eos> I gotta work. Go on in there, they need you.
- Fuck you. He's so scared, John.<eos> Know how many times I've helped him?<eos> Do you have any fucking idea?<eos> Oh. He's your little brother.<eos> I told him not to mess with Gilbert.<eos> I fucking told him, and he did it anyway.<eos> - I knew you'd be able to help.<eos> - I'm not saving him.<eos> - Thank you, John.<eos> - I can't. Oh, I don't know what we'd do without you, honey.
- I knew you'd be able to help.<eos> - I'm not saving him.<eos> - Thank you, John.<eos> - I can't. Oh, I don't know what we'd do without you, honey.<eos> Look, I...<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, John.<eos> Thank you for helping Kevin.<eos> He loves you so much.
We're building more bungalows?<eos> You have enough to worry about with your schoolwork.<eos> Just focus on that.<eos> Did you finish it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then go set the table for dinner.<eos> And that's where you can live with your wife and children one day if you want to.<eos> Mom?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, hello to you, too, kid.
Is he okay?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Is Eric okay?<eos> John.<eos> Hey, where are you?<eos> I'm at the funeral home.<eos> I'm coming over there right now.<eos> I don't think it's a good idea.<eos> - No, I'm gonna come over there right now...<eos> I don't want you here, John.
John.<eos> Hey, where are you?<eos> I'm at the funeral home.<eos> I'm coming over there right now.<eos> I don't think it's a good idea.<eos> - No, I'm gonna come over there right now...<eos> I don't want you here, John.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Just stay there, please.<eos> I need to ask you something. Please.
- Of course I do.<eos> - Like what?<eos> I thought so.<eos> I told you a story about us swimming.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> My dad... the way he taught Danny was he took him out in the middle of the ocean and he threw him overboard.<eos> He expected him to swim.<eos> And he did.<eos> When it came to be my turn... Danny jumps in the water and yells, "Come on in, Johnny. The water's great."<eos> Come on. I got you.

What did I need from you?<eos> I only needed one thing from you.<eos> What do you think it was, John?<eos> What do you think it was?<eos> Tell me that.<eos> What do you think I needed to hear?<eos> What did I want you to tell me?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, but for me.<eos> For me, not for you.
The sand feels good. Come on.<eos> You gotta eat.<eos> You really gave me a scare.<eos> You should know better.<eos> Why? What did I do?<eos> Well, you went out alone.<eos> You were lucky.<eos> You should never go diving alone.<eos> Diana called.<eos> She was worried about you.
Well, you went out alone.<eos> You were lucky.<eos> You should never go diving alone.<eos> Diana called.<eos> She was worried about you.<eos> We all were.<eos> Good thing Mike saw what was happening.<eos> Mike?<eos> Gallagher.<eos> John, you really don't remember him saving you?
Oh, God, I pray he didn't stretch little Rudy out in any other way.<eos> - Bitch, you going to hell.<eos> - I'll save you a seat. [man] Thanks for saying what we're all thinking.<eos> Sometimes, I feel like I don't belong on my own campus.<eos> [Sam] Right?<eos> They too busy patting themselves on the back for letting us in.<eos> Hey, thanks for hanging out during the show.<eos> You give me shit, but if I wasn't there to talk about the McRib...<eos> Shit would get way too real for a Monday morning.<eos> [chuckles] I got you, always.
No. - Gabe. - What?<eos> Give me my phone back.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - Give...<eos> - No. - Gabe.<eos> [Gabe] You're so silly.<eos> [Sam] Gabe?<eos> What?<eos> You want this? - You don't want it?<eos> - [laughing] [Gabe] You think you're so slick.
Okay, no, no, no, no.<eos> - No, no. - What? What?<eos> Stop, you're gonna mess up my hair. - Huh?<eos> - Like, more.<eos> Yeah, I am. I'm gonna mess up that hair like a light drizzle on a much too humid day.<eos> - [phone buzzing] - [laughing] [clears throat] Reggie wants you.<eos> [groans] Shit.<eos> I'm supposed to represent for the BSU at this caucus.<eos> Reggie's a...<eos> Yeah, except for when he corners you with a "'Sup?"
It's, um...<eos> So... you're a shark.<eos> - That's cool.<eos> I get that. - [chuckles] You know, you're always moving, and you only slow down to kill...<eos> Gabe, I know how analogies work.<eos> [both laugh] I guess what I'm saying is, you know, it's, uh...<eos> You know, romance in a place like this, it's been reduced to, like, hooking up, you know?<eos> Mm, romance.<eos> [Gabe] It doesn't exist here.<eos> I want to be more than just a hot lay for you, Sam.
You speak one, barely.<eos> Do not correct my English.<eos> [man mockingly] "Do not correct my English."<eos> I'm happy if you're happy.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Talking shit behind my back?<eos> You're fucking someone behind mine.<eos> He's my TA from doc class.<eos> We went for drinks once over the summer, and you know there ain't shit to do over the summer.<eos> I'm happy for you, Sam.
Don't do that, Jo.<eos> Not you. I have to unpack my best friend having a secret bae.<eos> Secret or white?<eos> Both.<eos> You know I'm biracial, so technically...<eos> Look, don't. You're not Rashida Jones biracial.<eos> You're Tracee Ellis Ross biracial. People think of you as black.<eos> [sighs] This is why I didn't say shit.<eos> No, you didn't say shit because you stay talking about how we can't give up on our men.<eos> Sam, we met in the comments section of that Medium article you wrote.
Well, you don't seem to mind any other time.<eos> There were cameras there.<eos> Roland Martin was a mere two feet away, and we all know how he loves to blast people on Twitter.<eos> I'm still in therapy from the last time I was trending.<eos> - But I'm in love with you. - [man] You better tell him.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You are the leader of the free world.<eos> You don't get to fall in love.<eos> And what about you?<eos> I'm in love with my job, which is to get little bitch babies like you to act like grown-ass men when the world needs them to do their job.
Engage the part of the student body that has the luxury of ignoring us.<eos> Not everything we do has to be geared toward white people, Sam.<eos> Hey, is this about the party?<eos> [Reggie] Nah. We planning to protest the library.<eos> Too many books in that motherfucker.<eos> [both laughing] You know, in 2017,<eos> I can't believe something like this could happen.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause I can. I mean, it's almost like you and I attend two totally separate schools.<eos> Hey, man, I'm just as pissed off as you are.
- Not possible. - [Gabe] No, uh...<eos> Look, that's not what I meant.<eos> Bro, just because you got a black chick on your arm doesn't mean you get to Miley Cyrus our pain, a'ight?<eos> Reggie. Chill.<eos> No, no, look.<eos> You're absolutely right.<eos> I have no idea how you feel. But I want to.<eos> Look, I'm Gabe.<eos> What are you gonna do, hit me?<eos> It might surprise you, but I don't use my fists to solve problems.

It's not worth it.<eos> Sam...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Everything that's going...<eos> - [Joelle] Sam, you okay?<eos> [woman on TV] Daddy?<eos> But I buried you on Tuesday. Holla if you need me, girl!<eos> Ooh, shit!<eos> Hey, are you all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine. I'm sorry to embarrass you in front of all your friends.

But now, follow me to the inn.<eos> Alright. For this crucial duty, you'll need to divide into two groups: single and married.<eos> Now, the married ones who have children, go back to your initial places.<eos> Now, those from the Black Sea region and Caucasia, divide as a group; the Kurds and Zazas as a group; the Arabs and Persians as a group those living on the coast, the Rumelians and Thracians, as a group; ...and those from Anatolia and the nomads, as another group.<eos> What is your name, son?<eos> Nazik, sir.<eos> Iâ€™m from Kayseri.<eos> Move over there.<eos> Pasha, I'd like to die on the battlefront for my country instead of dying here.<eos> I'd like to take you with me, but it seems that you've already completed your duty for your country.
Three or four, does it matter?<eos> Everybody has three, four or five wives.<eos> Oh, beautiful Gulbahar. Once...<eos> Just once...<eos> -What are you saying, weasel face?<eos> -I just want to hear her voice.<eos> We couldn't make her talk 25 years, how are you going to do it?<eos> God damn you.<eos> God damn you.<eos> Kudbettin, you can't marry anyone from this village.
Believe me, I have lots of expenses.<eos> Can I keep one fifth of it?<eos> You heathen!<eos> Am I taking all these for myself?<eos> Would I ever get something illegally?<eos> Never, your honor!<eos> Everybody knows how you help the dervish lodges, the madrasas and the poor.<eos> Please don't be upset, your honor!<eos> There you are!<eos> Now, you're talking!
If the vizier sent news to that village, there should be an important situation.<eos> Abdulcabbar, make the preparations.<eos> We're going to the village.<eos> Yes, your honor.<eos> I heard from Kudbettin that there is a village with very beautiful women.<eos> Forget about the village.<eos> 200 horses and 15 thousand coins are going to be sent, and you'll receive them in the lodge.<eos> Brother... Please forget about the coins and stuff.<eos> I have many horses, but no woman.<eos> Please take me with you.

Please forget about the coins and stuff.<eos> I have many horses, but no woman.<eos> Please take me with you.<eos> I may end up with one of them. You idiot.<eos> You'll receive the goods at the lodge secretly.<eos> Don't make me mad.<eos> You're not allowed to have a woman until you stop being an idiot.
Gentlemen...<eos> I'll be angry with you.<eos> You should take this seriously.<eos> Look, I'll give you very important and great news.<eos> You'll have a salary, a household, even vineyards and orchards.<eos> Girls, I don't believe that these warriors will come here.<eos> I hope nothing bad happens to them.<eos> Don't say that!<eos> Bite your tongue, you fake beauty!<eos> Nurdane, I want to ask you something.
All the warriors and ministers proposed to me.<eos> Your mother was the talk of the town.<eos> But I fell in love with your bastard father when I met him.<eos> Mom, please don't call my deceased father that.<eos> First, tell us this:<eos> Will those warriors like us?<eos> Oh, they will love you.<eos> Just do as I say.<eos> They can't find anyone more precious than you in this village.<eos> Mom, as a religious matter, we need to ask you something as your daughters.
They can't find anyone more precious than you in this village.<eos> Mom, as a religious matter, we need to ask you something as your daughters.<eos> Do you want to get married too?<eos> My daughters, I'll eventually marry.<eos> God willing.<eos> -Mom!<eos> -What?<eos> -You know the magistrate.<eos> -What about the magistrate?<eos> -It would be good if he married you.
Then, we'll own everything. We'll have power, prestige, gold, emeralds, velvets, lands and soldiers.<eos> We need to side with the powerful to avoid being weak with the weak.<eos> Power brings money, but money doesn't bring power.<eos> Look at these little trollops.<eos> Where did you learn all those things?<eos> -From you.<eos> -From you.<eos> The magistrate, huh?<eos> The deceitful magistrate.<eos> I swear, I'll make you pay for deceiving those naÃ¯ve old women.
Kamil, I became speechless, my heart flew away.<eos> All of these women are great and lovely.<eos> Oh, dear!<eos> Oh, dear!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Dilaver, how do I look?<eos> You look handsome.<eos> Guys, we look like gentlemen from Istanbul.<eos> Wow, Hamdullah, look at you!<eos> If women in Istanbul saw you like this, you would take their breath away.
God is the greatest.<eos> Kamil, are we in heaven?<eos> Straighten your backs, guys.<eos> Take the seat of honor and have a rest, gentlemen.<eos> Go ahead, men.<eos> Thank you, pasha!<eos> -My God!<eos> -Get up!<eos> Yes.<eos> That guy playing with his mustache has a crush on you, I guess.
It means "eat shit" in Arabic.<eos> Sir, the pasha wants you to perform the ceremonies.<eos> We can't stand up to the pasha.<eos> Bastard Kudbettin, the pasha came here, so there must be an important issue.<eos> If the pasha came, the vizier will come.<eos> If the vizier comes, the sultan will come.<eos> Sir, we have to host the pasha very well by all means.<eos> You're right, "Horrid-bettin"!<eos> Do everything to win the pasha's favor.<eos> Otherwise, I'll stick you up the pasha's ass.
But they gave me three instead of one. I don't know what to do.<eos> You know the saying "God gives you three chances".<eos> But three of them the same night...<eos> We should get going.<eos> Don't forget, I chose you to preserve your own language, culture and tradition.<eos> You're not porters anymore.<eos> You are the new owners and true masters of these lands.<eos> Go, make me proud.<eos> Pasha...<eos> If you have nobody to support you and if you are poor, nobody is interested in you.
If you have nobody to support you and if you are poor, nobody is interested in you.<eos> Rich people never look at our faces while we carry their goods.<eos> But you...<eos> You looked into our eyes.<eos> You treated us like humans.<eos> Pasha, we're grateful to you for choosing us and for giving us a chance to live these beautiful moments.<eos> Pasha, we aren't educated, wise and elegant like you.<eos> We are mere porters.<eos> Thank you for treating us like humans, pasha.<eos> Pasha, who would take care of poor porters like us other than you?
May God give you a long life.<eos> You're the father of all of us!<eos> Father, we entered the palace and found work there thanks to you.<eos> You always took care of us and protected us just like your children.<eos> You deserve the best.<eos> Go ahead, guys.<eos> You're going to make me cry.<eos> Father, I wish you would get married too.<eos> You wouldn't be alone at this age. And you would have a home.<eos> There would be someone taking care of you.
We thought over an issue and made a decision.<eos> We too want husbands!<eos> But we want one strong husband.<eos> We can get along fine.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> What are you saying, brother?<eos> Do you want to bury me alive?<eos> Anything is possible for status and prestige.<eos> So, your fate is to marry three experienced women.<eos> Nice to see you like this, Gulbahar.
And the first one is always the eldest one.<eos> Why?<eos> Our husband will choose who goes first.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Don't challenge me on day one.<eos> Otherwise, I'll throw your skinny body to the dogs, you fake beauty!<eos> -Look who is talking!<eos> -These women's voices are so scary.<eos> I'll make you...<eos> You...
It will get worse if he faints from day one.<eos> Dude, the guy fainted.<eos> He will waste the women.<eos> Let me go in.<eos> -Don't rush, be patient.<eos> I fainted again, right?<eos> Yes, pasha.<eos> Oh, my beautiful babies, I'll eat you up.<eos> Eat us, pasha.<eos> We've been waiting for you for 19 years, Dilaver.
Don't say that.<eos> What a shame.<eos> Shame is in bed, Dilaver.<eos> The bed is waiting for us.<eos> Come on, my lion.<eos> Do you want some walnut, honey and milk, Dilaver?<eos> No, I'm full.<eos> I don't want anything.<eos> Dilaver, come to your senses.<eos> I swear, we'll mess you up!

Ter, ter, ter, ter, ter, ter, ter!<eos> -Me!<eos> -Ter!<eos> Ter...<eos> My dear wives.<eos> Now, you go outside.<eos> And, leave me alone with my Feride as the lucky one tonight.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, my Feride, you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.<eos> I would die for you, my Feride.
Sure, my prince.<eos> Welcome, my prince.<eos> Wait for your turn.<eos> I'll go with the eldest first.<eos> Okay, my prince.<eos> I'm so excited, I can't speak.<eos> Don't be afraid of me.<eos> I know that you can't speak either.<eos> I will be your tongue.<eos> Allah sent you to me.
No.<eos> Gulbahar, you spoke.<eos> Thank God!<eos> As long as you can speak, our Hamdullah is all yours!<eos> He's all yours!<eos> The gentlemen of Istanbul, wake up!<eos> We have work to do!<eos> Pasha, I have never spent a night like last night.<eos> I don't remember how many times I fainted and came to myself again.<eos> May God bless you.
In the presence of the pasha and the witnesses, I pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> Surat al-Fatihah!<eos> The henna is on our hands.<eos> The belts are around our waists.<eos> We hope this bride will be happy.<eos> The prayers are in our mouths.<eos> The prayers are in our mouths.<eos> Oh, bride, bride, bride!<eos> Red-dressed, hennaed bride!<eos> May God protect you, Sparkling, veiled bride.
Get out!<eos> -Get out!<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Hey, who are these women?<eos> Stop!<eos> Afife, is that milquetoast with an almond-shaped mustache your husband?<eos> Godless man!<eos> She became my wife in the presence of God.<eos> Watch your mouth.<eos> Or I'll kill you!
Or I'll kill you!<eos> How could you marry off married women?<eos> Why are you acting like men?<eos> You are walking corpses.<eos> We have husbands now.<eos> Pakize, what are you saying?<eos> How can you have new husbands?<eos> Grandpa, watch your mouth in the presence of my wife.<eos> Do you see this?<eos> I will bring you down!
I have been known to be a pretty tender lover.<eos> Well, I'm gonna need a sample of your work.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Hi, beautiful.<eos> - Hi.<eos> How was that?<eos> I got your messages.<eos> We're on the next flight out.<eos> - Yes!<eos> See, that's why I'm marrying you.
We're on the next flight out.<eos> - Yes!<eos> See, that's why I'm marrying you.<eos> - You are lucky you just got here.<eos> You know, I was really mad about two glasses of wine ago.<eos> I have a very good excuse.<eos> See, I was securing our financial future.<eos> You're late because you were playing the lotto.<eos> Baby, you got to be in it to win it.<eos> Hey, I got you something.
You're kidding me!<eos> Is he really gonna miss the rehearsal?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I am the daughter of Reginald Swope.<eos> - I'm used to it.<eos> Hi!<eos> - Hi.<eos> All right, loving family, let's rehearse.<eos> - Thank God we are here. - Yes.<eos> Did I ever tell you that I love you, but I hate your driving?
Hi!<eos> - Hi.<eos> All right, loving family, let's rehearse.<eos> - Thank God we are here. - Yes.<eos> Did I ever tell you that I love you, but I hate your driving?<eos> - Why, 'cause I know how to drive?<eos> - You're terrible.<eos> Yeah, whatever. I'm terrible.<eos> Did you hear Megan's dad going on and on about the programs?<eos> Yes, and you need to tighten up, man, because it's my responsibility to make sure you handle your business.
Yeah.<eos> Good night.<eos> Your dad's always full of surprises, huh?<eos> What's next, prom date?<eos> I'm sorry, babe.<eos> You know, we haven't had time to spend with each other.<eos> Well, you know what's good?<eos> The fact that you have the rest of your life to make it up.<eos> But what happens if I gain 50 pounds, my hairline starts receding? - Ooh.<eos> - I stop making you smile.

Hmm.<eos> That's the easy part.<eos> It is!<eos> I can't wait to see you tomorrow in your tux, babe.
I've left Rob a dozen messages, Dad, and nothing.<eos> I'm really worried.<eos> Sweetheart, the candles have burned out, the doves escaped... and the aroma down there is getting... unhealthy.<eos> Well, what are you saying?<eos> Rob wouldn't just run out on me.<eos> Something terrible must've happened.<eos> - Well, maybe it's for the best.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> He could be dead!<eos> And that would be terrible, but he'd want you to move on.

Well... funny story!<eos> - I managed to get arrested.<eos> - For what?<eos> Because I may have ran butt-naked through the Bridge Run.<eos> Rob, I don't understand.<eos> I'm only sharing this with you because it's gonna be on the news at five, six, seven and 11.<eos> Are you not coming?<eos> Megan, it's gonna be okay.<eos> I can fix this.<eos> Baby, I love you.

Give him room now.<eos> Give him room. Let him breathe.<eos> Can I use your man right there?<eos> I come up and...<eos> You first come up and... ♪ Everybody dance now ♪<eos> - Slap it hard.<eos> - Oh! Come here and you grab like this.<eos> You my bitch.<eos> Okay, I lead, you follow.<eos> And then, I come around like this here, and I dip you.
Did you just puke coins?<eos> Would you look at that?<eos> A bicentennial.<eos> You know, these are worth a lot of money.<eos> You keep that for me.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> In what world did she pick you over me?<eos> I made a hundred mill last year.<eos> You made a hundred mill?<eos> I should fucking rob you.
The other half is pants.<eos> Go home and put some pants on, for God's sakes.<eos> Go! Come on.<eos> I... I see what's going on here.<eos> You want me to waltz on out of here so that I can miss my wedding, huh?<eos> Oh, yeah, because your little plot... to leave me trapped inside the elevator... blew up in your...<eos> Whoo, I am high. Face.<eos> First of all, that sounds like a terrible plan, and second, I have three women who can confirm I was in my hotel room with them all night. Third, if I wanted to ruin your wedding,<eos> Which I just realized would be absolutely perfect.<eos> - Come on, let's go get you married.
- Yes.<eos> Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the union of Robert J. Anderson and Megan W. Swope in holy matrimony.<eos> The bond this couple makes today is sacred... and should be entered into with reverence and honor.<eos> And now we come to the portion of the ceremony that holds great significance... the vows.<eos> I understand you two have written your own?<eos> Yes.<eos> Megan, would you like to begin?<eos> Yes.<eos> I once read, "Happiness is only real when shared."<eos> I didn't understand the depth of that statement until I met you, Rob, because you are the perfect man for me.

- Oh, it's my turn.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Megan...<eos> Obviously, I love you very much.<eos> Like, a lot.<eos> Like a lot, a lot.<eos> A lot.<eos> And I'm just so happy that I went on that date with Vicky...<eos> Well... because if I hadn't... I would've never met... her wonderful... beautiful... roommate.<eos> You.
- In your ears, I whisper, "I love you."<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Um... do you mind if you skip to the end?<eos> I mean, you keep mentioning these body parts.<eos> She's a big girl.<eos> We gonna be here all day.<eos> I didn't mean "big" in a bad way.<eos> I bet you is warm.<eos> "I have for the first time found what I can truly love."<eos> I found... you.

All right?<eos> I did?<eos> Rob.<eos> Rob, is this true?<eos> I don't... I don't... I don't know.<eos> No. You know what?<eos> You're done, Othello.<eos> We're gonna go.<eos> Megan. Megan. Megan.<eos> I believed in you, Rob, when no one else did.
Megan. Megan. Megan.<eos> I believed in you, Rob, when no one else did.<eos> I will never forgive you!<eos> Megan!<eos> Cody?<eos> Cody, uh, you gonna mess up your suit.<eos> Oh, yeah! Fire!<eos> Everybody, remain calm!<eos> Please go to the exits in an orderly fashion!<eos> I'm gonna kill you!

Baby, how did you get up here?<eos> I'm not gonna lie, it took a couple of tries.<eos> I can't believe you're here.<eos> I was so worried about you.<eos> You're not supposed to see me before the wedding.<eos> It's bad luck.<eos> Where's your tux?<eos> Megan, come here.<eos> Listen, baby.<eos> You know I love you more than anything, right?
- No, it's not about the wedding.<eos> Babe, I'm talking about the rest of our lives.<eos> I don't have a career, any goals.<eos> Maybe I'm not husband material.<eos> Is this about my dad?<eos> I mean, baby, since when do you care what he thinks?<eos> I know, but, baby, it's not just your dad, it's everybody down there thinks you're making a big mistake.<eos> And I think they're right.<eos> I feel like such a fool.<eos> It's not about you.

I...
He's my "ride or die bitch."<eos> Hell yeah.<eos> - You are.<eos> - You are.<eos> - No, you are.<eos> - You are.<eos> ♪ Ashamed of yourself ♪<eos> ♪ Self ♪<eos> Hey, Brian, let me ask you something.<eos> Does it bother you that you hold the record for the most Grammy nominations without a win?

I loved a lot of men.<eos> George Clinton, Sly Stone.<eos> Oh, Ma.<eos> The bass player from Con Funk Shun. Now, he was...<eos> - Okay, Mama. TMI. That is way too much.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> It was a different time, Robbie.<eos> My point is, my best would've been... if I had met a man that I loved and he loved me and we started a family that you could be proud of.<eos> Yeah, but why didn't you?<eos> You know, Rob, I just couldn't get out of my own damn way, but it ain't too late for you.

So... did I come up with anything good?<eos> Look, she said yes for a reason.<eos> Tell her how you feel, be honest.<eos> Well, I gotta get to the church.<eos> Thanks for not sleeping with me.<eos> Easiest money I ever made.<eos> Wait.<eos> You're a prostitute?<eos> - You didn't know that?<eos> - Who hired you?
And I know I haven't been the man... that you deserve.<eos> But all the time leading up to this moment... is exactly what I needed to put all my nonsense behind me.<eos> Someone once said it takes 10,000 hours... to master anything... but that's a long time to keep a beautiful woman waiting.<eos> And, Megan, you have waited a long time.<eos> But I promise you this:<eos> if marriage is like playing the lottery...<eos> I'm in it to win it.<eos> Oh, Rob.<eos> I know the man that you are.<eos> And all I need you to be is right here, right now.
- We're married!<eos> - We're married!<eos> I'm gonna get it, though.<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> How you doing, man?<eos> - Come on and see me, now.<eos> - I will, man.<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> You look pretty.<eos> I like that you dressed for the occasion.
There's a spell that seems strong enough.<eos> These are my students.<eos> They are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.<eos> No one but you can be within 20 feet of the blast.<eos> Alice is going to take just a few minutes to fully power up.<eos> This is a cacodemon.<eos> It'll grow much bigger.<eos> Unleash these, and believe me, they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.<eos> - Do you know what a Niffin is?<eos> - No. It's when too much runs through you.
Sit.<eos> Wait, is this really the most important thing we could be doing right now?<eos> I mean, The Beast is still out there waiting for us...<eos> The Beast can wait for five minutes.<eos> You are all Kings and Queens of Fillory.<eos> Well, almost all of you.<eos> Just revel in your majesty for one fucking second.<eos> Be regal, miscreants.<eos> You're such a stupid, stupid, man.<eos> I'm gonna kill you in your sleep.
I'm gonna kill you in your sleep.<eos> El...<eos> El... El, you okay?<eos> Totally fine, why?<eos> It's just... you went away there for a minute.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> I feel great.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I'm kind of on a clock here, so we should talk strategy.<eos> Yeah, we already talked strategy, so we just need to catch you up.
It's just... you went away there for a minute.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> I feel great.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I'm kind of on a clock here, so we should talk strategy.<eos> Yeah, we already talked strategy, so we just need to catch you up.<eos> You've been planning without me?<eos> Yeah... when we were on Earth.<eos> What did you think we were doing?<eos> Eliot, we're not trying to exclude you.
Look, I think we can all agree that we have a problem here.<eos> Eliot.<eos> He's High King.<eos> He's cursed.<eos> - We have no choice but...<eos> - We have to kill him.<eos> Exactly.<eos> The thrones.<eos> They're both cursed.<eos> This is hard for you.
They usually end once they've run their course.<eos> And not before.<eos> That doesn't help us.<eos> This one seems to want to run its course until they're all dead.<eos> Shit.<eos> Dead.<eos> - I have an idea.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Do not let them kill each other, okay?<eos> I call on you.

As a child of the Earth... I seek you, O Mother.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Mm?<eos> Do me a favor and just believe it.<eos> A benevolent Mommy who will solve my problems with her Gaia power?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or Reynard won't show.<eos> You realize I don't even own a pair of yoga pants.<eos> So act.<eos> I seek to know you, Divine Mother.

Yeah.<eos> Or Reynard won't show.<eos> You realize I don't even own a pair of yoga pants.<eos> So act.<eos> I seek to know you, Divine Mother.<eos> Giver of life and light.<eos> I ask to gaze upon you.<eos> To hear your voice.<eos> To feel the beating heart of you.<eos> I beseech you.
Hear me now.<eos> What happened?<eos> Where are we?<eos> A park.<eos> Few blocks away.<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> Take us back now.<eos> Well, we can't go back.<eos> Reynard's scented you before.<eos> If he smells you again, he won't show.
If you want him, you might just have to risk losing your bait.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're saying this now?<eos> Well, if I'd told you before, would you have agreed to it?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll walk.<eos> Oh, excellent idea.<eos> By the time we arrive, he'll be so engrossed in Marina's evisceration, he won't even realize we're there.<eos> You're good.<eos> I ask to gaze upon you.

To hear your voice!<eos> To feel the beating heart of you!<eos> Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding.<eos> Fuck this noise.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> You with a crossbow.<eos> You couldn't hit a fat girl with a fat-girl-seeking arrow.<eos> Oh, don't give me that look.<eos> It's a figure of speech.<eos> No way in hell I'll miss you from this range.
It's a figure of speech.<eos> No way in hell I'll miss you from this range.<eos> Well, if you use that arrow as good as you use your dick...<eos> You enchanted yourself, didn't you?<eos> I'm not an idiot.<eos> Margo says go free.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Penny says go free.<eos> You just had to let him save you, huh?
If Reynard had killed Marina, don't you think there'd be lots of little Marina bits lying around?<eos> She ran.<eos> I don't think she even finished the spell.<eos> We're gonna have to start this all over again, and now we've lost Marina.<eos> I don't even know how we're supposed to do...<eos> Don't be so hasty.<eos> Are you absolutely sure it didn't work?<eos> If I were your fox god, I might just, say, follow her home rather than kill her on the spot.<eos> You knew this was going to happen.<eos> Why do you think I took you out of there?
Watch your mouth, or I'll slice out your tongue, and I'll eat it in front of you.<eos> You're really not getting the message that you don't scare me.<eos> Oh, I think I do scare you.<eos> So rare for someone to try to summon Our Lady on their own.<eos> You're all alone, aren't you?<eos> There's... no else in your life.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Trying to hurt my feelings?<eos> And the best you can come up with is "why couldn't you find a man?"<eos> Is anyone really gonna miss you?
- No.<eos> No.<eos> There is no next.<eos> We are running out of time and options and god jizz.<eos> Look, just imagine dicks, okay?<eos> With one dick, you're just jerking yourself off, but with three dicks, suddenly you've got six people having sex.<eos> Which is more powerful?<eos> I think your metaphor literally doesn't make any fucking sense.<eos> It doesn't have to.<eos> It just distracted you long enough for Alice to power up the spell, which is all the shield charm has to do.
Hey.<eos> Thought exercise.<eos> Say we kill The Beast. Ahh... what then?<eos> Quentin, I don't know.<eos> It's just... it's a distraction.<eos> Come on.<eos> I would...<eos> I'd eat an ice cream sundae.<eos> With whipped cream and... those fake rainbow-colored sprinkles and... gummy bears on top.<eos> I'm probably gonna try and win you back.
You've changed.<eos> You are not the girl that I met a million years ago.<eos> You are amazing.<eos> And not that you weren't amazing before, but...<eos> Quentin, where are you going with this?<eos> You've grown.<eos> And you're still growing, and my point is that I am too.<eos> Are you saying you're "not that guy anymore"?<eos> No, I'm saying that I'm not just that guy anymore, and I think that you...<eos> I hope that you give me the opportunity to be better and actually deserve you.
Don't mind James.<eos> He's a Republican.<eos> Ah, fiscal conservative.<eos> Oh, that's fancy talk for "fuck poor people."<eos> - [James] Here we go. - [man] What? I mean, you have a framed picture of Reagan in your dorm room.<eos> [James] You have a framed picture of Stacey Dash in yours.<eos> What's your point? [man] It's not Stacey Dash.<eos> It's Dionne. Nothing after Clueless matters.<eos> Mm-hmm. Yo, nobody on this entire campus has the balls to do what you did, Lionel.<eos> And this article? The pussy you about to get, my man.
It did, Becca, and our dude Lionel here helped bust it up.<eos> I'm so not that guy either. I mean, I just couldn't not do something.<eos> White people are the fucking worst.<eos> [Conner] Right? What's fucked up is, on one hand, I get it.<eos> I mean, we're all just fucking human beings.<eos> Our skin, our eyes, our fucking genitalia... it's all a mask, you know?<eos> - [phone ringing] - [scoffs]<eos> Don't tell me you gotta go.<eos> Good.<eos> You don't mind, do you?

[laughs] I, uh, just get cotton mouth and nightmares.<eos> [Conner] Hey, so...<eos> Becca and I really dig you.<eos> Do you like us, Lionel?<eos> Yeah? [Conner] Are you... up for some fun?<eos> Fun?<eos> Fun.<eos> Anybody ever tell you you look like Wiz Khalifa?<eos> [Becca] Do you want to fuck me, Lionel?<eos> Oh, yeah. He wants to fuck you.
What's he gonna have to do, baby?<eos> I want to see the two of you together.<eos> [laughs] Oh, shit.<eos> Are you even down with that?<eos> What? "Are you even down with that?" [chuckling]<eos> Look, you don't need the wingwoman, okay?<eos> You're obviously just into guys.<eos> And you... I'm not sure what you're getting out of this.<eos> He's right.<eos> This was your idea. I said I thought it might be hot to see you make out with a guy once at a party. Not multiple guys over the course of two years.
I only want writers who have the guts to tell the truth, like Will Smith in that football movie everyone meant to see.<eos> That's why you write, isn't it?<eos> [Gabe] Don't worry. I'm gonna delete the post.<eos> [Lionel] Sam?<eos> [Sam] Shit.<eos> My editor wants to run with the story as soon as possible.<eos> But... if someone else breaks it before we do... you know?<eos> You'd ruin your own scoop?<eos> I guess I just don't like the idea of telling someone else's truth.<eos> Journalism's gonna be a big challenge for you.

I also wrote a piece called "The Cream in the Oreo"<eos> about my first mixed-racial threesome.<eos> People called it "an enlightening tale of race..."<eos> Kurt, I will never, ever, never, ever, ever collab with you on your piece of shit racist magazine.<eos> So you'll think about it and get back to me?<eos> Hey, Reggie.<eos> I came by your room this morning.<eos> Hey, Sam.<eos> Thanks for checking in, but...<eos> I'm fine. [Al] Yo, Reggie, after my class, I'm gonna come with you to the dean's meeting.
#EmphaticallyStatingOurCase.<eos> Y'all, we have a plan.<eos> Let's move. And in the meantime,<eos> I'll get ahold of Reggie.<eos> - See you.<eos> - My darling.<eos> - Yes? Are we still on for coffee?<eos> [inhales] Ooh. I'm not asking you to meet my parents.<eos> Just my friends.<eos> I mean, they're starting to think you're imaginary. Besides, for some wackadoo reason, the more I see you, the more I miss you.

[Gabe] I... told you my parents were from New Hampshire,<eos> I thought it was implied.<eos> It's a swing state. - [Milo] Can you even imagine a Republican Gabe?<eos> "Chaz, come summer on my very big boat.<eos> The deck is made of endangered rhino bones."<eos> [laughing] "Roland, you must try the caviar.<eos> It's like the salty tears of poor people."<eos> [laughing]<eos> [Gabe] Oh. Whew.<eos> I needed that. I can't imagine what this has been like for you.
Have you told Reggie yet? Uh, I...<eos> I can't get ahold of him.<eos> He's been MIA.<eos> [Vanessa] Well, makes sense.<eos> Public victim.<eos> Public what now? Well, in Behavioral Psych, we've been talking about how public victims don't have time to grieve because their trauma is immediately politicized, especially with social media and the 24-hour news cycle.<eos> They switched to Arabica beans.<eos> Reggie. Yo.<eos> What's up, Sam?<eos> [Sam] Hey. I've been looking for you all day.

Talk to me.<eos> I said I was fine. That was me, talking.<eos> And it was directed at you. Can't be more clearer.<eos> Okay. Well, did you get my messages about breaking up the pep rally?<eos> Yep.<eos> All 19 of 'em. You know, your Beyoncé gifs take up a lot of memory.<eos> Worth it.<eos> Where you going?<eos> [Reggie] I got somewhere to be. Okay, well, I'm coming with.<eos> All this time I've known you, I've never been here.
- I'm always down for...<eos> [feedback whining]<eos> It's totally crazy what's been going on on campus lately, and I just wanted to do something to help.<eos> I want my pain to heal Winchester.<eos> [Sam] What is this,<eos> Tyler Perry Presents The Nutcracker?<eos> She's raising the roof off of racism.<eos> This is like some Jane Fonda woke aerobics.<eos> All right, girl, time to wrap up 12 Minutes A Slave.<eos> I love you, baby.
My pain is not your platform.<eos> The whole movement is about pain.<eos> That's why we're out in these streets, because of our pain.<eos> You don't think Martin had pain?<eos> You don't think Malcolm had pain? Right now, I just need to be a man and not a movement.<eos> Ever since freshman year, you have done nothing but look to me to be the leader of the movement.<eos> You've put it on me every single day.<eos> Don't you think there's a woman under here?<eos> Sam, I didn't mean to put anything on you.<eos> I just believe in you.

Never there for me when I needed you.
Four years is no time.<eos> We have a car waiting.<eos> So we're shaking hands today?<eos> I think it's best we keep it like that.<eos> Well, shake it like you mean it.<eos> How's that?<eos> So you want me to just head over to the ballroom?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I do like looking at you across a large room.
No, actually the pain is right behind my eyes.<eos> Could you just... rub my eyes for me?<eos> But you hate that.<eos> I know, but I think I'll like it this time.<eos> You can do it harder.<eos> Even harder than that.<eos> There's no coming back from this.<eos> Oh, I know exactly what we're about to do.<eos> If we fail, it's on both of us.<eos> I won't be able to protect you.
The American people don't know what's best for them.<eos> I do.<eos> I know exactly what they need.<eos> They're like little children, Claire.<eos> Children we never had.<eos> We have to hold their sticky fingers and wipe their filthy mouths.<eos> Teach them right from wrong.<eos> Tell them what to think and how to feel and what to want.<eos> They even need help writing their wildest dreams, crafting their worst fears.<eos> Lucky for them... they have me... they have you.
[Fairbanks] You are on probation.<eos> One more incident like this, and you will have to find another campus to blow up.<eos> Now, I hear that Harvard has really loosened their admission standards.<eos> Please, see yourself out.<eos> Good meeting?<eos> Fucking fantastic.<eos> I don't know what you ever saw in that girl.<eos> She's a hothead.<eos> Her rhetoric makes this campus look like a powder keg of racial unrest, like a state school.<eos> Now, it's gonna be hard enough for you to convince these students to vote and elect their first black president.
Winchester is not just a school to me.<eos> I practically grew up here.<eos> And that party wasn't just painful. It was embarrassing.<eos> We didn't land on Winchester.<eos> Winchester landed on us.<eos> I got caught up.<eos> We need to work together to make our voices stronger!<eos> Too bad we can't vote.<eos> With me as your lifeline, we will have unprecedented access to the administration.<eos> So we should vote for you because your father's the HNIC?
[man over PA] Next group, Men's Crew versus Bechet.<eos> [man] Yo, Troy, get in on this!<eos> [Thane] Let's see what you got.<eos> [all chanting] Troy! -[whistle blows] [cheering]<eos> Troy! Troy! Troy!<eos> Troy! Troy!<eos> -[man] Come on!<eos> Don't forget. Vote Fairbanks.<eos> [Lionel] Last question.<eos> Why is it important that people vote for you?
[Kurt] 'Cause Sam invited people over.<eos> They showed up at my house, and, you know, purple drink ain't gonna serve itself, know what I mean?<eos> -I'm kidding. I'm kid-- look, Troy.<eos> If you get elected, you need to give me a pardon.<eos> -Not a governor.<eos> -A social pardon.<eos> I've been bailing you out since grade school.<eos> Remember that time you put the boot on the kid's wheelchair tire?<eos> Just because his legs didn't work doesn't mean he wasn't an asshole.<eos> You know, the BSU is pissed at you.
[woman] First, we're gonna have playtime and then snack time and then nap time.<eos> Go play. -Yeah! -[children cheering]<eos> Where's the rubber ducky?<eos> And some me time.<eos> No, you take the ugly one.<eos> -[Sam] Really, Coco?<eos> -What?<eos> You want to be a freedom fighter?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> This may come as a shock to you, but these people don't give a fuck about no Harriet motherfucking Tubman.
And they got to be for a night.<eos> I'm not about to go out into the street and protest a fucking Halloween party.<eos> [groans] [narrator] This perspective on race made the ideological chasm between Sam and Coco deeper than Thane's grave.<eos> Too soon?<eos> Not that I base my sense of well-being on the male gaze.<eos> But what, am I not pretty enough to get invited to a Pegasus party?<eos> Well, you know how I got in-<eos> - Brian.<eos> He still feels guilty about giving you chlamyds?<eos> Who gave you the STD? Oh, me?
-I'm just saying it's a type, not a rule.<eos> Right, look, there are aspects of my experience that no matter how hard they try, a white guy could never understand.<eos> Also, pink dicks just look weird to me.<eos> All dicks look weird, though. -[laughing] -Right?<eos> Drake could get it, though.<eos> Oh, how about that Jesse Williams?<eos> Oh, he is such a hottie.<eos> I nicknamed my vibrator Idris.<eos> [Sam] Dear white people, having a black vibrator does not count as an interracial relationship.<eos> [laughs] "Dear white people," dating a black guy to piss off your parents doesn't make you down-- it makes you an asshole.

Providing a public service.<eos> Where else you gonna get your hair did around here?<eos> Yeah, black hair matters.<eos> What are your majors?<eos> Neurobiology.<eos> -And yours, Tanika?<eos> Tanika dropped out last semester and won't leave.<eos> -Ain't nobody talking to you, Abigail.<eos> Two words-- traction alopecia.<eos> Sam, I love you, but this weave is going to change my life.
I was supposed to reserve it for the Alpha Delta Sassy but Classy Etiquette Tea, but I fucked up and--<eos> "Sassy but Classy"? That is a terrible name.<eos> Could you possibly find another venue?<eos> We've already sold a bunch of tickets. And this is kind of my big project.<eos> Can't you have your sass-tea somewhere else?<eos> Sassy but Classy.<eos> Look, the BSU wants to make a difference.<eos> We care about things like that.<eos> [Coco] Oh, we do?<eos> Because not that long ago, BSU didn't want you at their table.
Assata Shakur did, so boom.<eos> Don't Assata Shakur me.<eos> I told you about Assata Shakur.<eos> And what would she say about you overdrawing your bank account for a weave?<eos> You have a rat's nest on your head with a comb sticking out of it, running around campus trying to be Miss Blackety Black-Black.<eos> I wanted an avant-garde look, like Solange-- something that says, "I'm woke, but I'll also kick your ass in an elevator."<eos> Dear white people, let me tell you about yourselves when I don't even know who the hell I am.<eos> Oh, I don't know who I am, Colandrea?<eos> No, you don't, but I do.<eos> You're the girl who didn't learn she was black until Beth Wheeler left you out of her second-grade sleepover 'cause you'd be "the only one."
[Karen] She told me she was from Evanston.<eos> [scoffs] She just gets farther and farther north.<eos> She gonna be Canadian by Christmas.<eos> [Elizabeth] I wish we had gotten that chick Sam.<eos> That girl's gonna change the world. [Karen] Mm, yes.<eos> -[laughing]<eos> -[items clatter] -Sisterhood, huh?<eos> Tracey, you got an 850 on your SATs.<eos> If you weren't legacy, you'd be a flight attendant on Spirit Airlines.<eos> Elizabeth, your underarms are not your strong suit, and Mike dumped you 'cause you smell like slave socks.
No, I haven't! It's brilliant.<eos> It's bullet-proof all over!<eos> - Bullet-proof?<eos> Is it? - Yes.<eos> - Is it?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> - Oh, yeah, sounds like it.<eos> - Tanks feel like that.<eos> OK, then, these are guns. Use them.<eos> - What, on you?
- There isn't one.<eos> - An Alfa!<eos> ! Actually, he's right!<eos> No, astronauts have to get there.<eos> He's right! That's exactly - what the Quadriplegio is!<eos> - No!<eos> For porn stars and astronauts, which is what I am.<eos> Now, I would like to have a conversation about the Nürburgring.<eos> - Go on. - Because this is important. Last year, I was delighted.<eos> Sorry, why were you delighted about that?
Yeah, and we pick up the action the next day, as we go back to finish the job.<eos> On our way to get the last car, we stopped at the reef site to make sure everything was OK.<eos> Tom Daley!<eos> I don't like it.<eos> And after a few moments in the water, we discovered it wasn't.<eos> Where the bloody hell are they?<eos> There's the buoy. This is the wrong place.<eos> Yes, that marks the spot.<eos> They're just not here.<eos> Why did we trust you to fix them in place?
Why has Richard Hammond arrived in a Ford cortina?<eos> Wait.<eos> It isn't a Ford cortina, it's another biturbo!<eos> - No, this is the 430.<eos> - It isn't!<eos> - It is! - Biturbo.<eos> This isn't a biturbo. - It is!<eos> - That's a biturbo.<eos> Hammond.<eos> I'm sorry to have to tell you this.
"I've no idea what a mistral is but I want one!"<eos> Maserati.<eos> South of France.<eos> It just sounds right.<eos> However, fairly soon, reality began to stick its unwelcome nose into the equation.<eos> You get no heat in here and I can't de-mist at all.<eos> The brakes.<eos> It brakes one wheel very well. But only one wheel at a time.<eos> And you never know which one.<eos> James, are my lights dazzling you?
God almighty.<eos> I'm not sure that's possible.<eos> Oh, for... is that...?<eos> You're in the way.<eos> It's a one-way street my way.<eos> It's a one-way street, yes.<eos> That's why me and the other cars are all coming this way.<eos> Please don't make me back up with this steering.<eos> Come on, it's a workout.<eos> Hammond, I am gonna kill you.
Once again, I'd managed to coax my car into some kind of life and I was on my way.<eos> So, straight out of town.<eos> Sounding healthy.<eos> With a top speed of about 12, I was headed for the ferry port of le havre.<eos> The trouble is that logically, the others would be doing the same thing.<eos> Car, clear your throat, please.<eos> I'm out!<eos> Right, england, here I come.<eos> Clear your throat, car! Clear it! Or we shall be last.<eos> And then I shall have to sell you, and not to someone nice.

Or we shall be last.<eos> And then I shall have to sell you, and not to someone nice.<eos> You know that man who has sex with his cars and then puts pictures of it on the Internet?<eos> I'm going to sell you to him unless you get going. Now, come on!
No, he is not! He is not.<eos> No may?<eos> No, and there wouldn't be, because I was in another part of the port with my own travel plans.<eos> Last night, after the other two had gone to bed, I arranged for our company yacht to be waiting for me in the harbour.<eos> And there it is!<eos> I simply drive up, hop aboard, and then we'll be on our way.<eos> - He lived, annoyingly.<eos> - Hold on, hold on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hammond. I need to ask you about this.
- Oh, hello.<eos> Puff Daddy is arriving.<eos> - Do you think he's wearing a chain?<eos> You know, that thing costs four times more than the Jag.<eos> And it's not like the badges are that different.<eos> That Jag is... a car.<eos> This is more of a statement. This is a new way of understanding the condition of being human.<eos> It is the last word in luxury.<eos> It's a very expensive statement, though.<eos> I mean, if you've got the money to buy that, you could buy the Jag and still have £130,000 to spend on a PR agent to put you on breakfast TV talking about how great you are.
- Yes, do.<eos> ...I do quite like the interior of this car. No, I do.<eos> I'll be honest. I like the quilted leather, I like the wood that comes from a cliff and all of that.<eos> But the exterior, I'm sorry, it's hideous. - Ugly.<eos> - Yeah, well, hang on a minute.<eos> Because, do you remember, and it is a long time ago, when the Continental GT first came out, we all thought that was hideous...<eos> - ...and now we all love it. - It's one of the few things we agree on.<eos> - Yes. Yes, that's true.<eos> But I think this is more like you.<eos> When I first met you, I thought you were ugly.
But Nürburgring is the same in English as it is in German.<eos> I did it with voice control in German with my car. It was set to German. I said Nürburgring and it went "blink"<eos> - and I said, "Yes." But it's a similar name. - Don't blame the car!<eos> Well, I didn't pronounce it properly.<eos> That's like muddling up our names cos they both begin with J.<eos> Look, let's not get all bogged down with who's been a massive idiot and despite what he claims can't do anything properly.<eos> - Nothing. - Let's instead look for a race track near here. Why don't we try and find one?<eos> And that is exactly what Hammond did.<eos> Where?<eos> Well, it's all around you. Look, I've marked it out.
Sorry.<eos> You should...<eos> You should stay here, get some rest.<eos> I haven't slept in two days.<eos> You can, put it in the garage.<eos> Please tell me why we're lying to this poor bastard.<eos> We should tell him.<eos> He has a working car, and in case you haven't noticed, we're kinda stuck here.<eos> It's your wife and kid.<eos> Like you care about them.
It's where I've been trying to go.<eos> I was hoping you could drive us.<eos> I... I wish I could, I really do, but I'm down to an eighth of a tank, and I'm gonna need every drop to find my son.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do me a favor, and just sleep on it, all right?<eos> All right.<eos> "There once was an owl who said, 'What, ' and not, 'Who.'"<eos> You're sure about this, right?<eos> You prefer to keep listening to them bitching about us being childish, or do you want to be a hero, and have Zoe be all," you're my Mr. Strong Man.<eos> I want you so bad, Ted"?
I am trying to help you.<eos> Now, please kill the spider.<eos> Absolutely not!<eos> No!<eos> No! Please!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Jay, come on.<eos> You were accused, too.<eos> They didn't throw you out.
Previously on "The Mist"...<eos> This is not the first time nature's come alive."...<eos> She's worshipping a false god in your church.<eos> The rebar is in your brother's liver.<eos> I'm not killing you. Are you insane?
It looked at me, and it left.<eos> I don't want to be with those people anymore.<eos> What the hell you do that for, faggot, huh?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I thought this was Bryan Hunt's room.<eos> I'm Bryan Hunt.<eos> - Do you know who did this to you?<eos> - Jonah Dixon.<eos> Don't get attached to anyone.<eos> They'll just use you for their own good.
What?<eos> The distraction.<eos> I still hate that jacket.<eos> Maybe we can distract the others as well.<eos> Come on.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> I think I'm gonna head back to the loading dock, show off my new clothes.<eos> I'm gonna throw out that jacket when I get back.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I love you.

How did you know I was in there?<eos> Did you do this?<eos> Did you lock me in there so you could play hero?<eos> What? ! I heard someone screaming.<eos> I didn't even know it was you!<eos> Then who was it?<eos> How should I know?<eos> You really think I could have done this? !<eos> You know what?<eos> Fuck you, okay?
What's the matter, sweetie?<eos> Is your mind playing tricks on you?<eos> You must get that from me.<eos> I got nothing from you.<eos> How would you even know?<eos> You abandoned me in that horrible place.<eos> You... were supposed to take care of me.<eos> You're right.<eos> I wasn't a mother to you.<eos> All I ever wanted to do was to take care of you... but I was frozen on that sofa.

I needed you.<eos> No.<eos> I understood why you left.<eos> Deep down, I was happy.<eos> You were finally free of me.<eos> Mom?<eos> Mm, baby doll.<eos> Every day, I tried to say it, but I could never get the words out.<eos> Say what?<eos> I love you.

Let me finally be a mother to you now.<eos> Let me help you die.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> I don't.<eos> Oh, baby doll, yes, you do.<eos> You never realized, but we were always in this together.<eos> I'm so tired.<eos> And you don't have to be any longer.<eos> You can stop running.<eos> There's no one waiting for you.
- What are you doing?<eos> Help!<eos> - Help me.<eos> - Get him up.<eos> Come on.<eos> Quick.<eos> Mom.<eos> Mom!<eos> No!<eos> I told you to stay away from her! Mom, stop!
Previously on "The 100"...<eos> Your blood can save us.<eos> Everyone.<eos> Becca went to space to make Nightblood in a zero-g environment.<eos> We need to go to space to make Nightblood.<eos> Raven, your brain scan showed evidence of a stroke.<eos> It could kill you.
Everyone needs rest, Clarke.<eos> Even saviors.<eos> There she goes.<eos> I have to.<eos> Going to the island today to take rocket fuel to my mom and Raven so they can go to space to make Nightblood.<eos> It's now officially our only hope.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't stop that boy from destroying your home.<eos> That's not your fault.<eos> Besides, now we don't have to worry about locking 450 people out when the death wave comes, or sharing it with Azgeda.<eos> Lexa would be proud of you.

My security detail can protect us.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's very generous.<eos> We are all in this together now.<eos> I'm gonna check on Octavia before we go.<eos> Clarke, I'm going with you.<eos> You can't.<eos> I'm the chancellor.<eos> That's why you can't.<eos> After everything that happened this morning, our people need you here, now more than ever.
Aah!<eos> - Jeez. - Mission failed.<eos> All work and no play makes raven a dull girl.<eos> Hey.<eos> All right?<eos> I have had enough of your stupid, little jokes.<eos> Why don't you take it easy, huh?<eos> You're just a self-loathing bottom-feeder.<eos> Abby's an idiot for trusting you.<eos> She doesn't know you like I do.

_<eos> It's the intention that matters.<eos> Raven needs you, John.<eos> She's been in there a long time.<eos> Well, in case you haven't realized, Raven hates my guts.<eos> I don't think that was her talking.<eos> Oh, no, no, it was.<eos> You know that little limp she's got?<eos> Yeah, that was me.<eos> I don't think she hates you for that as much as you hate yourself.

You'll be running around in no time.<eos> What happened to his guards?<eos> That's enough for now.<eos> I'll come back soon.<eos> I'm glad you're still alive.<eos> You won't be soon.<eos> Jus drein, jus daun.<eos> I killed no one.<eos> Wrong. You killed them all.<eos> And now they're gonna kill you.
Trikru burn their dead.<eos> They're still here.<eos> Back up now.<eos> There is no one here.<eos> They've taken the truck.<eos> The fuel.<eos> Clarke.<eos> If you're such a good tracker, go track.<eos> You were saying?<eos> I don't want to shoot you.
I'll unload the fuel.<eos> I'm gonna take the Rover back to camp.<eos> Octavia?<eos> It's pathetic, right?<eos> She hates me but I keep coming back for more.<eos> She's your sister.<eos> She's blood.<eos> She'll come around and see how special you are.<eos> Clarke...<eos> If I don't see you again...
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...<eos> You wanted to be informed when he arrived.<eos> Any idea yet why he's come down to D.C.?<eos> If the Horseman has set his sights on the president of the United States, nothing will deter him from his goal.<eos> My whole life I believed there was something bigger out there and now I find out it's all true.<eos> Remind me to punch you even harder than I usually do.
You're right.<eos> The first duty of a parent is to protect their child.<eos> A... A friend reminded me of that only recently.<eos> I will always regret what happened to you, Henry.<eos> But if you are a demon, you chose the wrong face.<eos> For I cherish the opportunity to speak once more with my son.<eos> To tell him that, in spite of everything between us, I always loved him.<eos> I never gave up hope for him.<eos> Every battle I joined, I did for those I love and seek to protect.<eos> Especially you, Henry.
I'm trying.<eos> Not hard enough.<eos> Let's go, guys.<eos> Great!<eos> A hipster strigoi...<eos> It's been a week. Did you get<eos> - the powder working again?<eos> - No, but look at this.<eos> Hi, I'm Dutch Velders.<eos> I fought with you, right here in Red Hook, actually.
Hey!<eos> We're supposed to keep the munchers out of the safe zones, not give them new ways to come in...<eos> So this is the thing that actually makes the microwaves - in the microwave?<eos> - The magnetron, yeah.<eos> I'm using the radio to modulate a frequency with a signal from a dead station.<eos> So if I'm right about the microwaves being their carrier frequency, then this should blast the strigoi with white noise, and drown out all the communication it's getting.<eos> You know what might do the most good for New York in the meantime?<eos> If Justine Faraldo got laid.<eos> Well, that can be your next project.<eos> Well, I was going to give that assignment to you.

What is it?<eos> Mr. Kruger?<eos> My name is Roald Pirk.<eos> I believe you are expecting me.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> Just a moment.<eos> Have we met someplace before, sir?<eos> Not that I recall.<eos> Please.<eos> May I offer you a drink?

And you are not who you say you are, Jew!<eos> _<eos> I recognized you right away.<eos> I expect you wish you had brought your cane inside with you!<eos> This'll do.<eos> I've worked for years to arrange for this encounter.<eos> I was expecting to find Thomas Eichhorst.<eos> This was meant for him, you see.<eos> But in his absence,<eos> Dr. Dreverhaven, I will settle for you.
They used sunlight to hide the text so the strigoi could never read it.<eos> "After being surrounded<eos> "by an army of thousands,<eos> "the living plague was contained "within a stone sarcophagus<eos> "lined with an alloy "of silver and lead.<eos> "A tomb for the creature "and for the crimson worm "within it.<eos> Trapped for all eternity."<eos> A box?<eos> The box.<eos> I told you you would find nothing.
"by an army of thousands,<eos> "the living plague was contained "within a stone sarcophagus<eos> "lined with an alloy "of silver and lead.<eos> "A tomb for the creature "and for the crimson worm "within it.<eos> Trapped for all eternity."<eos> A box?<eos> The box.<eos> I told you you would find nothing.<eos> Herr Eichorst keeps his whereabouts a mystery.<eos> I don't believe you.
Holy shit.<eos> They're digging their own tunnels now.<eos> - That's how six - _ of my tagged munchers came out to hunt tonight.<eos> And when the sun went down, they used these new tunnels to pop up<eos> - inside your safe zone. - Shit!<eos> The good news is that now I know<eos> - where they're coming from. - Central Park.<eos> Underneath Central Park.<eos> I found an old chamber, way deep down.<eos> I'm telling you, there were thousands of them down there.
Not combat or physical destruction.<eos> As long as the crimson worm survives, the Master can always transfer bodies.<eos> Yes, but if he is contained within the silver, and his communicative power suppressed by the lead inside the box, then he's truly powerless.<eos> No wonder he's hiding.<eos> Yes. Therein lies the challenge.<eos> We now know how to defeat the Master, but we don't know where he is.<eos> Or even who he is.<eos> There is one person who could find out.<eos> Have you reconsidered my offer?<eos> I will never give you the formula for the white, but I will give you a dose.
Hurtado?<eos> Tunnel's clear!<eos> Country Club, Bam-Bam, get in there.<eos> See what's going on.<eos> Come on, hustle.<eos> Come on, go, go, go, go, go, go!<eos> Awesome.<eos> _<eos> You've just gotta go for the head.<eos> Think they were looking for you, bro.
Well, he must be close by!<eos> Zack?<eos> Zack, are you here?<eos> - He is not.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> Where is my son?<eos> He is a very special young man.<eos> So much potential.<eos> He is safe.<eos> From you.
What hum?<eos> It's hard to explain.<eos> When I was down...<eos> By definition, a hum is not silent.<eos> But bottom line, is there anything in here that tells us how to destroy the Master?<eos> Not with clarity, but it does mention his destruction in several places.<eos> Well, for example:<eos> "When the Face of God shineth upon him, his essence is destroyed." Good.<eos> All we have to do is find the face of God.<eos> You missing the metaphor there, Doc?
But you must beware. The Master knows your desire.<eos> You could be playing right into his hands. Of course.<eos> I'm very fond of Zack.<eos> Should an opportunity to rescue him arise, I'll do what I can to assist you.<eos> - I appreciate that.<eos> - And our best hope of creating that opportunity is the Lumen.<eos> It will provide me the key to destroying the Master.<eos> And when I do, perhaps we can recover your boy.<eos> Professor, just got a message through Faraldo's people.<eos> Rudyard Fonescu wants to meet with you.
Mom?<eos> Zack!<eos> Mom,<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> Help me.<eos> No, Mom.<eos> No!<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> What did the Master offer you for it?
Previously on The Strain...<eos> - Where's Zack?<eos> - We want the Lumen.<eos> You have a choice to make.<eos> The Lumen or Zack.<eos> - What did the Master offer you for it?
They were keeping Zack alive to trade him for the Lumen.<eos> - Now there's no need for that.<eos> - I'm sorry about your boy, Ephraim.<eos> Now, please leave.<eos> I don't want to see you right now.<eos> - May I use your bathroom?<eos> - Where the hell have you been?<eos> You don't wanna know.<eos> Clearly you've been sleeping in a dumpster.<eos> You're smelling pretty ripe there yourself, Doc.
Get out, get out!<eos> Come on, come on, come on!<eos> You made it back.<eos> I knew that you could.<eos> There's... there's something different about these creatures.<eos> OK? I mean, they're not moving together anymore.<eos> Right?<eos> They're doing their own thing now.<eos> I'll make a note of it.<eos> - Can I help you with something?
Thank you, but letting myself off the hook is not exactly my style.<eos> I believe that.<eos> Where in the hell did you get a Taser?<eos> - Guy I know.<eos> Would it work on a strigoi?<eos> Uh, contracts muscles.<eos> Should incapacitate them for 10, 20 seconds?<eos> All I'd need.<eos> What are you gonna do now, Doc?<eos> You're looking at a man without a plan.
And she deserves to have somebody. Maybe he's that someone.<eos> Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Or maybe he's that someone that blows in with all the sizzle and jazz of a master garlic braider, only he's braiding someone else's garlic on the side.<eos> -That would suck.<eos> -Not on my watch.<eos> I'm really nervous now too.<eos> Well, hey-hey. Here he is.<eos> Hey, guys. Great to finally meet you.<eos> Your mom talks about you two all the time.<eos> I got a few more boxes in the car.<eos> We will give you a hand.
You guys, that is it.<eos> Get off!<eos> Hey, off! Go.<eos> I am taking you home. Where are your keys and where is your car?<eos> - At home.<eos> - OK, fine. I'm gonna put you in a cab.<eos> No, I'm putting you in a cab.<eos> I'm putting all of you in a cab!<eos> Why are you going all Leaving Las Vegas on me right now?<eos> I mean seriously, what is wrong with you today?
I'm sorry, sir...<eos> Sir, I'm sorry, but the plane has already left.<eos> Sir, please.<eos> You can't be here. Sir!<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Just fuckin' drive.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> - Get you feeling pretty good?
Um, not...<eos> I can't remember, is the helicity of a particle left-handed if its spin and motion is the same, or opposite?<eos> - It's... - No, hold on, I got it.<eos> Hold on, don't answer that.<eos> Opposite.<eos> I knew that. You know that's really annoying?<eos> Uh, it's, you know, just got to... Recharge the old short-term every once in a while.<eos> You know, this feels like old times.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, I mean, I know, obviously, this is our first time working together, but I am learning a lot from you.
Science teacher had her do a project, you know, and this project...<eos> I spent every waking hour tinkering and perfecting her solar-powered oven.<eos> Anyway, ten-year-old determination, you remind me of her.<eos> Did you scold her as well?<eos> Look, I know that this has been hard for you, but you're not in it alone.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Hell yes, I am.<eos> I... as much as you all want me to be part of your team, that's never going to happen.<eos> I'm always going to be a father first.<eos> And one day, Zoom is gonna make me choose between you and my daughter, and every time, unblinkingly, unflinchingly, I would choose my daughter.
I can't lose anyone else.<eos> You won't.<eos> I did it.<eos> What?<eos> Whoa, whoa, what is that?<eos> I stole your speed.<eos> I gave it to Zoom. No, no, no, this isn't...<eos> What... you're working with Zoom?<eos> No, not at first.<eos> We trusted you.
You won't.<eos> I did it.<eos> What?<eos> Whoa, whoa, what is that?<eos> I stole your speed.<eos> I gave it to Zoom. No, no, no, this isn't...<eos> What... you're working with Zoom?<eos> No, not at first.<eos> We trusted you.<eos> I trusted you!
You're the bait.<eos> What?<eos> This is for two years ago, Clay.<eos> Stay.<eos> You know, it's ironic.<eos> I was just saying how much you remind me of the old Wells, and now, here we are, just like I did with him, standing on either side of this glass with me asking you, "Why?"<eos> I'm doing what I have to do to save my daughter.<eos> Yeah, at any cost, right?<eos> The cost of Joe's daughter.<eos> I told you, "I would betray you."

I can't give on a world.<eos> This is a world full of people who are facing death.<eos> I don't know, I may not be fast enough to beat Zoom yet, but I'm not gonna just close the breaches and forget about it.<eos> We have to help Wells.<eos> Look, guys, I... I was the one that trusted him first. I own that.<eos> I let him stay when literally all of you told me not to, so everything that's happened up until this point, it's on me, but this has to be a group decision.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well... I guess this is good-bye.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I told you, we're a team.
All right, let's go, come on.<eos> Go.<eos> Hey, um... you don't know where the restrooms are around here, do you?<eos> I keep losing my way.<eos> It's so silly.<eos> No hiding.<eos> You need to be downstairs.<eos> Move.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> I almost believe you.
So that means there's not gonna be any Amnesty International, or former US presidents, or fading rock stars flying in to save us.<eos> We will have never existed.<eos> You understand?<eos> I understand.<eos> All right, because that was the good news.<eos> The bad news is that this woman's bleeding to death.<eos> And if she dies, we will get blamed by everyone.<eos> The coup will scapegoat us out and her friends will think we were on the coup's payroll.<eos> Okay, so what do we do?<eos> He's just telling you the reality of your situation.
You really should be downstairs.<eos> We don't want civilians running around, getting into trouble.<eos> Yeah, uh, sorry.<eos> I recognize you.<eos> You were at the reception earlier with... let me see, Gabrielle. Is that her name?<eos> Yes, yes, we're here to, uh, expand the cell phone network.<eos> In fact, I can show you...<eos> Holy shit. Oh, God, uh...<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I was, uh... going to show you a brochure.
But I think Lazar came out here to meet someone like me, a fixer.<eos> See, a coup isn't pulled together in a vacuum.<eos> The leaders would make sure they have at least tacit outside support before they move, corporations that would jump in and do business with new bosses.<eos> All in exchange for extremely favorable contracts to be negotiated later.<eos> - Right.<eos> - I still don't see how it helps though.<eos> Because there's more going on here than a coup.<eos> I think Lazar just met with his fixer and...<eos> I think I know who it is.<eos> I'm gonna try and get something going. Slow down Lazar, give you some time.
We need her to get out of here.<eos> - What about this CIA man?<eos> - He's finished.<eos> Then who is doing all that shooting?<eos> At last.<eos> He put up a good fight.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He will be remembered as a national hero.<eos> You can still do this, General.<eos> I'm telling you, a trial, some good PR.
Shit.<eos> Where are your men, Vorza?<eos> Stand back or we'll shoot.<eos> You know, I've seen too many guns today.<eos> So I'd rather settle this the old way.<eos> I've been looking forward to meeting you, Mr. ex-CIA.<eos> Yeah, probably under better circumstances.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> The circumstances are perfect.<eos> When I'm done with you, we shall leave.
And you can call me, James, by the way.<eos> Oh, in another life, maybe.<eos> - Until then...<eos> - Yes, Madam President.<eos> I suppose you'll be wanting that cell phone contract.<eos> No, that's someone else's problem now.<eos> I think I'm gonna request to be moved back to New York.<eos> Turns out I'm not great with revolutions.<eos> We all have our lives to live, but just know that my nation will be forever grateful.<eos> To both of you.
- Show me some ID. - It's in my wallet, OK?<eos> Take it easy.<eos> - Hands where I can see 'em.<eos> - I'm just gonna go for my wallet.<eos> I'm gonna put my phone down and reach for my wallet. Take it easy.<eos> - You live next door?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> OK.<eos> OK.<eos> I am sorry to scare you.
This gun killed Officer Dempsey's partner at a routine traffic stop.<eos> This one was ordered on the Internet.<eos> No background checks.<eos> This gun killed Bob and Sue Grant's 14-year-old son.<eos> And this is the gun that killed Agent Edward Meechum.<eos> Not many Secret Service agents buried at Arlington.<eos> I'd say he earned his place.<eos> I took it for granted, how important he was to me, how much I leaned on him.<eos> It's clear to me now, now that he's gone.<eos> I don't wanna make the same mistake with you, Donald.
A heartbeat away from the presidency is a serious matter now.<eos> Conway is a tough opponent.<eos> I never expected you'd want me.<eos> I thought I was just a placeholder.<eos> No, we can win, Donald.<eos> You and I, together.<eos> I don't know, Frank.<eos> You need someone who's hungry for this.<eos> I'm not a great campaigner.<eos> - Vermont doesn't help you.
I agree, sir.<eos> We can do better than Blythe.<eos> Well, I am hard-pressed to come up with anyone better than a man who actually knows what it's like to sit at that desk.<eos> We can offer you some names.<eos> - He'll be devastated.<eos> - Let me talk to him.<eos> No, it's better that I do. Let me talk to him.<eos> We'll get you that list right away.<eos> Well, all right. If you can come up with some alternatives,<eos> I'm certainly willing to listen. Thank you all very much.
- He was exploring behavior adoption and--<eos> - Stop.<eos> We are talking domestic surveillance, LeAnn.<eos> And the only theory I'm interested in is risk versus votes.<eos> And he gets us the votes.<eos> Didn't you hear the leadership?<eos> They said Conway is destroying us.<eos> Macallan reverses that, he wins us the election.<eos> "ICO occupies Kurdish stronghold."<eos> How many of you have heard of ICO?
Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> Governor, can you comment on your relationship with the search engine Pollyhop?<eos> Is it true Pollyhop is providing you with voter data?<eos> - I want Grant here, right away.<eos> - Uh, he's in California I think.<eos> He's got two Gulf Streams.<eos> Have him pick one.<eos> Thank you so much, thank you.<eos> Thank you, take care.
Me and Conway.<eos> Now, Conway has a powerful gun, a search engine.<eos> And it's powerful because with it, he can tell what you think, what you want, where you are and who you are.<eos> He can turn all those searches into votes, and that's enough bullets to kill my chances of winning.<eos> But I have an even bigger gun.<eos> It's called the NSA.<eos> It's one of the perks of being president.<eos> That is, if the courts allow my surveillance request.<eos> I imagine the men hanging on these walls wished they'd had a gun like that available to them.<eos> Your phone, the phone of the person sitting next to you, your neighbor's phone and everyone you know and the 300 million Americans you don't know.
Aidan. This is Doug Stamper.<eos> Yeah, I know who he is.<eos> Tell me why I'm here.<eos> Domestic surveillance.<eos> We need to win an election.<eos> - You serious?<eos> - What if we were?<eos> The NSA...<eos> - You'd take that risk?<eos> - If you can be trusted.
- How would this even work?<eos> To get backbone access requires--<eos> We're getting a FISA ruling, counter-terrorism.<eos> I've never won a bid from the NSA--<eos> - LeAnn, let's go.<eos> - You'd win the bid.<eos> This is what you want, Aidan.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You came here to see if you can trust me.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?
Anything for you, Governor.<eos> Can I get a photo? Of course.<eos> How you doing, Rich?<eos> - Is this, uh, Pollyhop thing true?<eos> - Let's get Hannah in this. Hannah.<eos> - Oh, Jeff.<eos> - Hannah, good to see you.<eos> - Good to see you. How are you?<eos> - Mr. Grant is here.<eos> I'm good, how are you?
- We've met before.<eos> - Oh, yes, that's right.<eos> You know why I'm calling, Mr. President.<eos> No, but I have been reading some curious articles.<eos> How long before you think it becomes mainstream?<eos> You planted that reporter.<eos> I did not.<eos> You're giving me far more credit than I deserve.<eos> If you bring the Justice Department into this,<eos> I'll come down hard on you for abuse of power, and that'll hurt you just as much as it hurts me.
- No, tougher.<eos> Stronger, tougher!<eos> All right, what about...<eos> Thirty years from now when you're dying in hospice care... you can look back and be proud of all the lives you saved.<eos> Or you can be forgotten... clutching onto the past with your cold, dead hands.<eos> I'll show myself out.<eos> That's exactly the steel goddamn stomach I was talking about.<eos> Was it Pete Dreyer?<eos> Congressman Dreyer's been a mentor for years.<eos> - He had no right to tell you.
I'm not going to play politics.<eos> You played politics the moment you opened your mouth to Pete.<eos> - Did you see my speech yesterday?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> I meant every word of it.<eos> Now, you and I have both fought for our country.<eos> Underwood hasn't.<eos> He has no idea. He doesn't understand.<eos> And that's why I need to be president, so we can strike when we need to strike.<eos> Look, I can help you, but I need your help to do so.
A little hi.<eos> Can we get a little hi?<eos> No? That's all we get?<eos> That's all we get.<eos> And this is Hannah, my wife. And our little rascal Lily.<eos> Well, she's not so little anymore, but definitely still a rascal.<eos> Aren't you, sweetheart?<eos> And we are webcasting from our home here in Albany.<eos> As you can see, we don't live in the governor's mansion.<eos> We live in a regular house, just like many of you.
And we are webcasting from our home here in Albany.<eos> As you can see, we don't live in the governor's mansion.<eos> We live in a regular house, just like many of you.<eos> And this is our living room.<eos> Hannah has decorated everything herself.<eos> Well, except for the toys.<eos> That's the...<eos> That's the kids' addition to the decor.<eos> A lot of toys.<eos> Now, many of you have seen or read in the news rumors about my campaign teaming up with the search engine Pollyhop, and I'd like to speak to you today about those rumors because they're not rumors at all.

One hundred percent accurate.<eos> And here is my good friend Benjamin Grant.<eos> He's the founder of Pollyhop, and he's gonna tell you about our partnership.
Can we see what you're searching for?<eos> Are we reading your emails?<eos> The answer is no.<eos> We're not tracking individuals.<eos> We're looking at metadata, large-scale browsing patterns, search trends, regional portraits.<eos> 'Cause Ben is right.<eos> A president should know his constituents.<eos> And the Internet is the best tool for that.<eos> Now, I've met thousands of people and shaken a lot of hands, but I can't meet everyone.<eos> So this is my way of listening to millions of you.
Hello.<eos> - Oh, wow. How far along are you?<eos> - Almost seven months.<eos> Thank you so much for inviting us here.<eos> This is a real treat for us.<eos> Well, I'm glad you came.<eos> I thought you'd be in Times Square tonight.<eos> It's Governor De Luca's last year in office.<eos> I thought he should have the spotlight to himself.<eos> Well, that's very classy of you.
Yeah.<eos> So is there any way you would go there with us?<eos> Seriously?<eos> I know that's a huge thing to ask, and if you don't want to uproot your whole life for someone you've only been with for a few weeks, and not even really been with, then I-I completely...<eos> I completely understand, but I was just hoping that there was... that was maybe something you would possibly consider.<eos> Emma, if you want me to come, I'm gonna go with you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> People sometimes make accusations in therapy that they believe are true but are not, in fact, true.<eos> Of course, yes, but what I told you is true.
People sometimes make accusations in therapy that they believe are true but are not, in fact, true.<eos> Of course, yes, but what I told you is true.<eos> And I have reported it to the local authorities.<eos> They're looking into it.<eos> It will take some time.<eos> They will get back to me, but in the meantime, you are under my care, and we should simply continue to do the work you were here to do.<eos> You don't believe me.<eos> I believe you believe it.<eos> It should be investigated outside this facility.<eos> That's not my job. My job is to help you.
Oh, yum. - All right, hold on.<eos> - Mmm. Can I get two, Carlos?<eos> Thank you, buddy.<eos> - Ooh, that's good.<eos> I never had a hot toddy.<eos> What's in it?<eos> I'm not sure... cinnamon, I think... whiskey?<eos> It's mostly whiskey.<eos> I like whiskey.<eos> Sheriff, they want a picture with you.
Hey, you.<eos> You get off of him.<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> I want to see you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Who would do this?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Norman?<eos> Dr. Edwards.<eos> How are you doing?
You're outside a club called The Landing Strip.<eos> You and Julian came here earlier tonight.<eos> The two of you got into a fight with some of the bouncers.<eos> Did anything bad happen?<eos> I don't think anyone got hurt except the two of you, if that's what you mean.<eos> Look, I'm going to find an officer and have him take off those cuffs.<eos> There's no need for that.<eos> Then I'll take you back to Pineview, but we're going to talk, Norman.<eos> All right.<eos> Maybe Julian told you, but this isn't the first time he's broken out of Pineview.
Then I'll take you back to Pineview, but we're going to talk, Norman.<eos> All right.<eos> Maybe Julian told you, but this isn't the first time he's broken out of Pineview.<eos> He doesn't really want to get away.<eos> He wants us to come find him.<eos> That's the point.<eos> Making us chase after him is how he convinces himself someone cares.<eos> I've been trying to help Julian for years, but I haven't gotten very far.<eos> He won't let me.<eos> Is that how it is with you, Norman?

Reverend Anderson.<eos> Sidney.<eos> Sidney.<eos> Were you and Norville close?<eos> Not really.<eos> No, sir.<eos> I lived next door.<eos> You're the young man who found him.<eos> Yeah. Kyle Barnes.<eos> Norville spoke about you.
Thank you.<eos> It's a nice place you got here.<eos> Used to be.<eos> But everything goes to shit eventually.<eos> Like your marriage.<eos> It's hard to keep a romance alive once you start throwing punches, isn't it? Okay.<eos> What about the Austin boy?<eos> I saw his face.<eos> You... You can't seem to help yourself.<eos> I think I'm gonna go get the reverend for you.
Well, that's certainly a change in attitude.<eos> They changed, Reverend.<eos> Why does everyone expect me to stay the same?<eos> Nothing wrong with mixing things up.<eos> But...<eos> Some things are fine just the way they are.<eos> Like, we used to sit here for hours, you and I playing Scrabble, backgammon.<eos> Why'd that have to change?<eos> I don't know how much time I've got left, Reverend.<eos> I'm tired of playing games with you.
- It's a spiritual matter.<eos> You think she's spitting up pea soup, head spinning around, floating up to the ceiling?<eos> Sophie, there's something you don't know about your mother.<eos> That she was possessed by the devil and that you tried to exorcise her two years ago.<eos> I didn't want to worry you. We thought we dealt with it... Dealt with it?<eos> She finally told me what you did.<eos> Locking her up for days, starving her, beating her, - beating the devil out of her.<eos> - That's not her talking.<eos> Then you show up here with this monster.<eos> Yeah, she told me about you, too. - What you did to that little boy and your own daughter.
I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so, I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them.<eos> I am The Flash.<eos> Previously on "The Flash"...<eos> I'm in full-on Vibe mode right now.<eos> I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris.<eos> I felt slower. I did it.<eos> I stole your speed.<eos> I gave it to Zoom. Give me back my daughter.<eos> Bring me the rest of Flash's speed.<eos> I told you we're a team.
Open it.<eos> You'll have to leave these.<eos> Then I might as well turn around right now and go back.<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> You'd be surprised what I seen turned into a weapon.<eos> I wouldn't go in there with a fucking paper clip.<eos> I need those things.<eos> Reese.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Chief, can I talk to you about something?
I can't believe you haven't come to see your old pal.<eos> I don't know who you are...<eos> - but you're not my pal.<eos> - Come on, don't be that way.<eos> How should he be... after you killed his wife?<eos> This is Reverend Anderson and Kyle Barnes.<eos> They're here to help you.<eos> You all being here is help already.<eos> Sit. Please.<eos> I'd shake, but... you know.
- but you're not my pal.<eos> - Come on, don't be that way.<eos> How should he be... after you killed his wife?<eos> This is Reverend Anderson and Kyle Barnes.<eos> They're here to help you.<eos> You all being here is help already.<eos> Sit. Please.<eos> I'd shake, but... you know.<eos> It's awkward.<eos> Luke here says there's something inside you, something that made you do... what you did.
Also, I found a lab that'll do all the DNA testing.<eos> It's not that expensive, but it takes about a month.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> What?<eos> I want you to put all that stuff in my office along with your report.<eos> And get yourself cleaned up.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> He said I'd never be free of this.<eos> He was manipulating you, making you doubt yourself.<eos> What about you?
I thought you had all gone the way of the dodo. -[both laughing]<eos> -That's, uh... the extinct bird, right? -Yes.<eos> -Oh.<eos> Well, I wish I had parked farther away.<eos> Why am I laughing?<eos> -[laughing] -[Maria] I have an unearned sense of confidence. I really like you, Diane.<eos> Would you want to go to the beach or maybe Coffee Bean sometime?<eos> Oh, well, that would be... fabulous.<eos> [in normal voice] Know what?<eos> I've got to be honest with you.
No.<eos> Get it from yourself.<eos> But that's literally what stand-up is.<eos> It's looking for approval from strangers.<eos> -You're thinking too much. -Okay.<eos> Just do the work.<eos> -Put these tampies in your bag. -Okay.<eos> -All right, sweetie, have a good day.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> [Danny] "Excuse me, can I 'ass' you a question?"
My life is pretty complicated, too, right now.<eos> I'm actually going through a divorce.<eos> [gasping] Oh, my God!<eos> I don't know how it'll work out.<eos> [laughing awkwardly] No! Of course, we don't know... ever, how it's gonna work out, do we?<eos> Oh... I'm late for something.<eos> -I gotta go. -Oh. I was hoping to check out more of the house.<eos> Okay, you can.<eos> The thing is, come by later, and I'll microwave you some taqooktito...<eos> [sighs] I will microwave you some taquitos!
[gasping] Oh, my God!<eos> I don't know how it'll work out.<eos> [laughing awkwardly] No! Of course, we don't know... ever, how it's gonna work out, do we?<eos> Oh... I'm late for something.<eos> -I gotta go. -Oh. I was hoping to check out more of the house.<eos> Okay, you can.<eos> The thing is, come by later, and I'll microwave you some taqooktito...<eos> [sighs] I will microwave you some taquitos!<eos> Get it right, Maria!<eos> [laughing] And then, I'll show you more of the house and the pugs and...
[laughing awkwardly] No! Of course, we don't know... ever, how it's gonna work out, do we?<eos> Oh... I'm late for something.<eos> -I gotta go. -Oh. I was hoping to check out more of the house.<eos> Okay, you can.<eos> The thing is, come by later, and I'll microwave you some taqooktito...<eos> [sighs] I will microwave you some taquitos!<eos> Get it right, Maria!<eos> [laughing] And then, I'll show you more of the house and the pugs and...<eos> Everything.<eos> I'll show you everything.
[Maria chuckling] [Brian] Here we are.<eos> Last drink of the night.<eos> Something we call "Glass of Sugar."<eos> Oh, what's in it?<eos> Sugar in a glass.<eos> -Garlopfft left for the night. It's late.<eos> [hyperventilating] I can't believe I've been stood up, Brian.<eos> You know, you were gonna break up with him, so it's probably for the best.<eos> What kind of guy doesn't show up at Manjjiaznoz?<eos> I'll tell you the kind of guy.
He said he was one action date away from nailing it down.<eos> [stutters] He wanted to sign me?<eos> He was an agent?<eos> Yeah.<eos> At CAA.<eos> Our team pulled your OKCupes profile.<eos> What did you think those action dates were about?<eos> -I mean, you had him hiking, spelunking, sailing.<eos> If that kiln explosion hadn't literally ripped him in half, signing you would have. -[chuckling awkwardly]<eos> -Yeah. Anyway, I'm picking up his sloppy seconds, and I want you to know something important.
-[softly] $10,000.<eos> Thank you, sweet monkey grape.<eos> I knew you'd come through.<eos> -Yeah...<eos> -Excuse me.<eos> Thanks, Maria.<eos> This means a lot to me and my family to have a night out like this.<eos> Oh, guys.<eos> No problem.<eos> Hey, I just wanted to thank you.
And now... I faced 'em.<eos> Those kids hate me, but it doesn't matter.<eos> I mean...<eos> -I still got you.<eos> -You had me.<eos> I have some bad news.<eos> My family's not cool about us.<eos> This whole May-December thing is a no-go zone, bro-zone.<eos> What?<eos> I'm crazy about you, Maria.
What about your Hippocratic oath?<eos> Are you a hypocritical Hippocratical?<eos> I thought this was all democratical.<eos> What, now you're making all the decisions?<eos> Are you dictator, Dr. Dictator?<eos> Are you a doctator?<eos> Frytator, Potator, Cheese grater.<eos> I thought your name was Dr. Achter.<eos> Okay, Maria.<eos> Could I speak with you for a second? Have you ever been diagnosed with any mental illness?
I should have him go see my stand-up.<eos> That way he sees all my garbage.<eos> He'll know all my faults, all my demons.<eos> Pull the Band-Aid off, and then... he can leave, and... I can just find somebody else who I like maybe a little less, but it's... less scary.<eos> This has been fascinating.<eos> -You know, a journal...<eos> -Yeah?<eos> ...is a great place for private thoughts.<eos> [theme music playing]<eos> [Maria] You ever had a creepy thought, like, [gasping] "Oh, what if I licked a urinal?
-Five bucks.<eos> -You cretin!<eos> [panting] Bruce!<eos> Bruce, I need your help. I screwed up.<eos> I screwed up bad.<eos> I'm so sorry, my sweet.<eos> -Now is not the opportune time.<eos> My crippling financial woes have forced me to put all my objects up for sale on Craigslist.<eos> And, right now, this college-aged viper is squeezing my manhood with his pricing.<eos> I'll give you... 200 bucks for everything.
‭ - Yeah.<eos> Okay, let's -- let's do it.<eos> Okay, right in front of the house.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is fantastic.<eos> ♪ Pepper, can you hear me? ♪<eos> ♪ Pepper, can you see me? ♪<eos> ♪ Pepper, I am standing in the driveway ♪<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Can I help you?
- O-okay.<eos> When you see my movies later, you're gonna realize that this is a special moment.<eos> Come on.<eos> And "cheeeeese"!<eos> Cheese!<eos> See? That's an old actor's trick for a perfect smile.<eos> Except you and I are smiling.<eos> You guys aren't smiling.<eos> W-what's the matter?<eos> It's not you, Mr. Liotta.
What's up, Ray?<eos> Barbra, I have some of your mail from when you used to live over at Cedarhurst.<eos> And I have a friend here that would like --<eos> Just leave the mail by the gate.<eos> I'll send someone down.<eos> O-okay, but --<eos> Oy. There's more?<eos> Uh, Ms. Streisand, hi.<eos> My -- my name is Mitchell Pritchett, and I have been a fan of yours since I can't even remember, and -- oh, your artistry and integrity has inspired me my whole life, and I just --<eos> Aaaah! I can't even believe I'm talking to you right now.
I have people put on my pants one leg at a time.<eos> That's so funny.<eos> Barbra, today is his birthday!<eos> Well, technically, it was three weeks ago.<eos> - All right, you're blowing it.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> You sound very sweet, Mitchell.<eos> I-I was thinking maybe as a special treat, you could --<eos> I'm not singing into my gate, Ray.<eos> Well, it was very nice to talk to you.
You're gonna be fine.<eos> Of course I will.<eos> I've got the goddess of love and openness on my side.<eos> Yeah, well if you need the goddess of numbness and Xanax, I have some in my purse.<eos> Hey, everybody.<eos> This is Krystle.<eos> Oh, my Lord, you are exactly how I imagined you.<eos> -Well, I'm not-- -That's not--<eos> Oh, my goodness, you're so beautiful.<eos> -Well, thank you.
We're just roommates.<eos> -OK. -I mean, it's not like a Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Cooper situation.<eos> -Toklas.<eos> -Right.<eos> But I did start dating a yam farmer.<eos> -You have? -You did?<eos> You did?<eos> The cute one?<eos> We'll talk about it later.<eos> Well, it's not my world, so I shouldn't give advice, but if it's what you want, then I hope Robert's the kind of Christian who can forgive you.
I'm just saying, if you wanna do this, you're gonna have to open yourself and your family up to a whole lot of scrutiny.<eos> Even down here a campaign can be... rough.<eos> People talk. Rumors spread.<eos> One way or another, a candidate's true self gets revealed.<eos> That can be a good thing or a bad thing.<eos> What it can't be is a surprise.<eos> So you gotta know, Detective... why the hell do you wanna be sheriff?<eos> Cabochon labradorite.<eos> Sterling silver.<eos> I don't know if it's gonna fit you.
- Could be.<eos> - Diaz.<eos> I mean, he may be working a different angle, but if he's feeling confident, we need to find out what that angle is.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> That was Largo.<eos> Some nut job lost his shit on a waitress up there and they want us to head up.<eos> What do they want us for?<eos> Someone specifically asked for me and you.<eos> This her?<eos> Hi, how are you?
You think she's working for Lowry?<eos> Could be.<eos> - What, off this guy's word?<eos> - Run her through the system.<eos> I'm sure we'll find something.<eos> Did I just hear you say that?<eos> This is our chance to get Lowry.<eos> Do we really wanna fuck that up?<eos> Detective Rayburn.<eos> I'm afraid Miss Cortez can't help you.
- Who are you?<eos> - Miss Cortez's attorney.<eos> She has nothing to say.<eos> Usually when you guys pop up this quick, the clients have a lot to say.<eos> - Are you charging her with something?<eos> - I don't need to.<eos> She's got pending charges and a bench warrant for missing her last court appearance.<eos> Well, then I'm here to bail her out.<eos> Why don't you take a seat, because she's gotta be processed and go in front of the judge.<eos> For your own sake, I'd encourage you to stop what you're doing and let her go.
- What's your name?<eos> - Meg Rayburn.<eos> I'm his lawyer.<eos> Is Carlos here?<eos> No.<eos> A few nights ago, he picked up his shit and took off.<eos> Okay, is there any chance that you could get a message to him?<eos> Depends.<eos> What's the message?<eos> Did he ever tell you about my brother John Rayburn?
Please don't do this to me right now.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're all I got, man.<eos> - Good luck, brother.<eos> - Jake.<eos> Jake.<eos> Jake.<eos> Len.<eos> I heard you were here.<eos> How are you?
- Yeah.<eos> - There's too many tourists. - Ah.<eos> I'd rather stick around here and see what I can find.<eos> How long you planning on staying?<eos> As long as it takes until I can catch a big one.<eos> Goddamn if you don't put on a good act.<eos> I mean, you... You act like you have my family's best interests in mind...<eos> But if you did, you wouldn't have given Danny those tapes, Len.<eos> Well, John...<eos> I'm not sure that I agree with you.
Uh, can you give me one more day?<eos> Okay.<eos> See you then.<eos> Hello?<eos> John?<eos> Miss Rayburn?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> You stay right there.<eos> Why were you looking for me?<eos> I just wanted to talk to you.
You stay right there.<eos> Why were you looking for me?<eos> I just wanted to talk to you.<eos> I know the truth about your case.<eos> I know what you and Danny did to that witness.<eos> I'm so sorry, Miss Rayburn.<eos> I mean, you trusted me and you helped me.<eos> I know about the drugs, too.<eos> I never meant for anything bad to happen.<eos> And I don't want anything bad to happen to you.

- Lowry's men.<eos> - I know.<eos> He can protect you.<eos> Just talk to John.<eos> Can you do that, please?<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> - This better be fucking good.<eos> - We're sorry to bother you, Judge, but we have an affidavit for a search warrant that needs impartial eyes.<eos> Oh, well, that's cute, detective.<eos> I tell you what these impartial eyes are seeing.
The way this works is, you bring your stuff to him, he'll sample it.<eos> If everything checks out, he'll text me, I'll meet you by your car and pay you.<eos> Yeah, I don't...<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - That's not gonna really work for me.<eos> - And why is that?<eos> - I'd just rather stay here.<eos> There's a sample in the sugar if you wanna try it.<eos> If you're satisfied, you get the money, you bring it to me, and I'll tell you where to find the rest of it.
Miss Rayburn.<eos> What?<eos> - It was her idea.<eos> She bribed the witness. - No.<eos> You mean it was Danny's idea.<eos> No, it was your sister, Meg.<eos> She didn't think she'd get my charges dropped, so she got Rafi Quintana to pay the witness. Fuck you.<eos> My sister barely knew you.<eos> Why would she care about your charges?<eos> Because she wanted me to help you.
I want to see my baby.<eos> Where is he?<eos> There is no baby, dear.<eos> But I heard him.<eos> I heard him cry.<eos> I want my baby.<eos> Where's my baby?<eos> What's your name?<eos> What's your name?<eos> Do you ever think your dreams are trying to tell you something?
He's a married man and a senior partner.<eos> We found his wallet around the corner where the perps dropped it.<eos> He refused to give a statement till we let him call "in-house security."<eos> Any reason I can't take him home?<eos> - I'd like a statement.<eos> - Why?<eos> You don't want to do the paperwork. He doesn't want to testify.<eos> I'm sure the good people of New York would rather have you out on the street.<eos> Come on. Help me out here.<eos> I'll get you something on paper tomorrow.
That's a nice name.<eos> I'm Dr. Song.<eos> What did you want to talk to me about?<eos> I want you to examine me.<eos> For what?<eos> I want you to tell me if I've ever had a baby.<eos> A baby? - Yep.<eos> - Um, Tess, according to your computer records, you've already asked Dr. Obie and Dr. Rosenthal up at Mount Sinai to examine you.<eos> So?<eos> I think you should see a mental health professional.
- Not really.<eos> Let me call you back. Thank you.<eos> Did you tell him?<eos> Could you possibly be more obvious? Did you say anything to Hull about me?<eos> Your personal life's not a threat to the firm.<eos> Oh, Jesus. Thank you.<eos> The next time you shag the wife of a senior partner, tell her not to sext you on your company cell.<eos> Yeah, it was a mistake.<eos> I swear.<eos> I owe you.
- Right.<eos> My feeling, for what it's worth? The world revolves around meetings.<eos> Without meetings, we wouldn't get to know each other, exchange fresh ideas, have conversations.<eos> Don't you think it's important to have conversations?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I have a project. I need your assistance.<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> I don't like being held hostage.<eos> Who's holding you hostage?<eos> I'm asking to borrow you for five minutes for which I will pay you $50,000.
Nothing that grandiose.<eos> I'm not asking you to play gypsy fortune teller.<eos> Even if you could tell the future,<eos> I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.<eos> All I want is for you to spend the afternoon in a hotel suite with a friend of mine.<eos> - Doing what? - Nothing big.<eos> I just want you to sleep with him.<eos> Not like that.<eos> It's dreams.<eos> Do you ever get the feeling your dreams are trying to tell you something?

Next stop, Wichita.<eos> So I guess you found me.<eos> I guess.<eos> Don't tell Bill.<eos> - Tell him what?<eos> Tell him... you know...<eos> He loves when I play piano.<eos> Cole Porter.<eos> What's your name?<eos> I don't have to tell you.
The sky's fine right where it is.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> How'd you get past the doorman?<eos> Apparently your Christmas tips weren't all they should've been.<eos> My wife is such a cheap bitch.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She took 'Cilla up to the... house in Stockbridge.<eos> I was supposed to join them, but... I guess I missed my train.<eos> What did Woody say to you?
What girl?<eos> Go back to the girl.<eos> There's Chinese in the refrigerator if you get hungry waiting for the police.<eos> When I began, I was a man of science.<eos> I believed there was no truth beyond what we can see and test and prove.<eos> I don't believe that anymore.<eos> Now most nights, I wake up in a cold sweat, convinced some deeper truth has revealed itself in my dream.<eos> If only I can hang on to it before it fades away.<eos> There's a war going on, a war for control of our dreams, and the outcome just may hinge on the fate of a single person, a special and powerful person.<eos> Now you can believe me or not, but what if your dreams are trying to tell you something?

Getting ditched by your girlfriend.<eos> That's real nice, gentlemen.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So what's going on?<eos> Possible flu outbreak.<eos> State and local officials are present.<eos> We're still waiting on federal.<eos> Dr. Cannerts is here from the CDC.<eos> That's a lot of important people just to talk about flu shots.<eos> I've E-mailed you the security footage showing the young, Middle Eastern man in question.
Sabine Lommers, Health and Human Services.<eos> Not gonna shake your hand.<eos> Nothing personal.<eos> The Feds are here.<eos> - Do we have GEMA present?<eos> - Here.<eos> - EIS?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> CDC.<eos> Most of you don't know me, but the fact that I'm here should have you worried because I don't get called until things get bad, so let's get started.
Stop it!<eos> Hey, Jana, McKinley Research is sending over their CPU today, high priority.<eos> Can't wait, Dennis.<eos> Well, all right, then.<eos> Major Carnahan, thank you for meeting me.<eos> Oh, you can call me Lex.<eos> You seem important enough. Ha ha!<eos> Certainly act like it, don't I?<eos> Please.<eos> Lex, I asked for you because you strike me as someone who could be a benefit in this situation.
He had a cold, nothing more.<eos> What's in this? His belongings.<eos> Where's he at?<eos> No.<eos> Sayid...<eos> Hey, hey, hey, tell her she can't touch him. He's infectious.<eos> We'll need to take him with us.<eos> Just stay... just stay calm.<eos> Stay calm. Just stay calm.<eos> Damn it, I'm trying to help you.
Once we're 48 hours disease-free, our lives can go back to normal.<eos> Until then, have faith in the authorities and please know that everyone is working to keep us all safe.<eos> We need you all to back up, please.<eos> Ma'am, please, I need you to back...<eos> This is just temporary.<eos> People, trust me, you do not want back in that part of the city.<eos> Now back up, please.<eos> I need you to find somewhere to stay for the next 48 hours.<eos> 48 hours?<eos> The City Crisis Center will help you make arrangements.
Spleen is engorged.<eos> All evidence indicates that the timeframe from exposure to expiration is under 48 hours.<eos> I must declare the virus as highly contagious and fatal in 100% of its victims.<eos> I recommend we institute a cordon sanitaire to contain the spread of the virus.<eos> What I need is the truth.<eos> Yeah, I'm in the middle of - the damn hot zone, Lex. - Jana!<eos> If we let anyone out, we're risking the lives of everyone in this city.<eos> The situation is chaotic at best, as thousands have been displaced from their homes and separated from loved ones.<eos> I'm standing here in the 500 Block of Spring Street, at the outer edge of the cordon's perimeter.<eos> We'll be reporting to you live as the situation develops.
Follow the rules, all right?<eos> Keep 4 to 6 feet apart.<eos> Stay inside.<eos> It's for your own good.<eos> You'll be all right, baby.<eos> Hey, media stays behind the line.<eos> Officer, can I have your name, please? It's Major.<eos> I'm a little busy here.<eos> That's very nice, but as you can see, media relations is not my top priority at this exact moment.<eos> ...I'm about to make you a national hero.
Is that going to be a problem?<eos> In what way?<eos> Upholding the boundaries of the cordon is paramount to containing this virus.<eos> No one gets in, no one gets out.<eos> So, if your personal attachments lead to any rules being compromised,<eos> - any special treatment...<eos> - I know what my duty is to this city.<eos> That's what I told the others.<eos> Dr. Cannerts.<eos> I'd like you to meet Major Carnahan from Zone 6.
You're my new stalker, aren't you?<eos> - I hear you're looking for a girl. - No comment.<eos> A lot of people in danger if she's sick outside the cordon.<eos> A lot of people in danger if she's sick, period.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> I still have connections in a lot of places from the days when people actually liked me. You're welcome, by the way.<eos> For the piece.<eos> Oh, you think I'm looking for validation?<eos> I'm just doing my job.<eos> You know, I asked Public Health PR for a one-on-one with you and they said no.
I'm doing OK so far.<eos> I'm helping this nice teacher look after her kids. So, how are you holding up?<eos> Oh, I'm perfectly fine.<eos> Can't tear my eyes from the news, though.<eos> Don't open the door to anyone.<eos> My secret lover the mailman will be sorely disappointed to be turned away.<eos> You just be safe, my love<eos> The virus is spread through bodily fluids, such as saliva and mucus.<eos> If you believe you've been exposed, it is imperative you do not come into contact with anyone.<eos> Our doctors and nurses are conducting preliminary screening and will be with you as soon as possible.
Quentin's grandparents, too.<eos> Plus, I have other kids who may be stuck here, so...<eos> I guess this is home for a while.<eos> Cannerts has my number if you run into any trouble.<eos> Mm-hmm. Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry about earlier.<eos> Sometimes when I'm, uh, upset, I let anger get the best of me.<eos> I know the type.<eos> I had a kid with one.<eos> Those kids, they'll be looking to you, you know?
Jay's death was not in vain.<eos> We will meet Zoom again. And the next time, I will beat him, whoever that monster is.<eos> Uh, it didn't look this deep on the map.<eos> That's 'cause maps are flat.<eos> This is, like, 1,000 feet deep.<eos> Well, you want to get faster.<eos> Maybe plummeting to your death is the motivation you need.<eos> So to reach escape velocity, you're gonna have to go... that fast.<eos> Well, that fast is impossible.<eos> I can promise you that.
I'm sorry, my love, but this game is not over yet.<eos> Despite my wishes to pursue Savage alone, it seems that you're all intent on seeing this thing through till the bitter... Oh!<eos> Speaking of bitter.<eos> You knew.<eos> You dropped us off five months later - because you knew.<eos> - Knew what?<eos> You knew that Laurel was going to die, and now you're going to take me back, and I'm going to save my sister.<eos> - I'm afraid that that...<eos> - You should be afraid.<eos> I can't allow you...
Staying here to fight Nazis is exacerbating the damage that we have already done to the timeline.<eos> - But Kendra...<eos> - Is alive, thankfully, and we will rescue her in due course.<eos> I hope.<eos> - So this is a spaceship?<eos> - It's a timeship, but yes, it does also travel through space.<eos> You... you've seen it before, Mr. Hall.<eos> That used to be my name.<eos> Carter Hall.<eos> There really is rather a lot to fill you in on, and we really do not have the time.
I appreciate that, Mr. Rory.<eos> I must say, it's been an honor to serve as your cap...<eos> Rip.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Miranda.<eos> I...<eos> Where...<eos> I'm still here, Captain.<eos> I know you are, Gideon.<eos> May I share something with you?
Fine.<eos> - So did you tell him?<eos> - That he killed himself to save our destinies?<eos> If it's any consolation, I can always bring you back to this particular time and place.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Just let it be.<eos> A full compliment.<eos> To be honest, I had my doubts that all of you would be willing to throw in with me for a second go.<eos> - Well, actually...<eos> - We're not coming with you.
I represent what a growing majority want.<eos> The future, not the past.<eos> A kinder, more tolerant attitude to marriage and divorce.<eos> That's not me.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then a government in your name.<eos> Slow down here.<eos> They tried to bribe my butler. A hundred pounds!<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> - For a photograph of the two of you.
But no, if it gives me time to reflect and work out my priorities and to settle, not just in the marriage, but you know, generally, it'll be worth it.<eos> Don't be like that.<eos> Everyone's just trying to help.<eos> Oh, yes, by putting a problem on a boat to Australia and hoping it sorts itself out or better still, sinks.<eos> You know it is possible that you might enjoy it, and thank me.<eos> Don't dress betrayal up as a favor.<eos> Better go. Can't stand around chatting.<eos> - Your Majesty!<eos> - Will you be back late?<eos> I'll be right with you, Cecil.
You should've seen him over there on Earth-2.<eos> I was like, "Somebody get this man an Oscar."<eos> He will know, Allen.<eos> He will know.<eos> All right, then what am I supposed to do?<eos> I mean, how am I supposed to stop Zoom?<eos> Do you know the answer to this equation?<eos> If Thawne figures out that it's you, the timeline will be altered.<eos> People can die.<eos> Others could live, and no one will know who or what will be affected, but I promise you, when you come back, things will be different.
Pump in some sound stimuli to counteract his tinnitus.<eos> Then we'll make some nonexplosive replacements for him.<eos> Deal with you later.<eos> Take them out, Hartley.<eos> Now.<eos> Dr. Wells.<eos> That was quite an observation you had about Hartley in there, Mr. Allen.<eos> Yeah, it just seemed too easy taking him down, you know?<eos> Well, the likely reason for that is you're getting faster.<eos> Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.
We don't...<eos> Wells?<eos> Yeah, I have an idea, Allen.<eos> Let's keep the breaches closed forever.<eos> Forget about the breaches.<eos> Forget about Zoom.<eos> Wait, I'm sorry,<eos> I thought that you were on board with this.<eos> No. No. I said I would help you get faster.<eos> I did not say I would help you give the man who kidnapped my daughter and tortured her a chance to do it again.
I can't do it.<eos> That's right.<eos> You can't.<eos> What are you doing here? You said...<eos> I know what I said.<eos> But you're not gonna stop, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Okay, Barry Allen, then I'm gonna do what I can to make sure you don't get killed.<eos> I recalibrated these to the electromagnetic frequency of this Earth.<eos> It should help you access enough of the trans-dimensional energy to manipulate it.
I mean, this shop was your life.<eos> Peddling kibble?<eos> Cleaning up gerbil shit.<eos> Oh-ho, that's some life.<eos> Jesus, Kyle!<eos> - You okay? - Yeah.<eos> - Brian, friend... - Whoa, whoa.<eos> I don't like to be touched.<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> - No one's here to hurt you.

That it's him the demons are feared of.<eos> - I'm just scared you're not gonna be able...<eos> - Then go.<eos> Fear gives them strength, and if that's what you bring here,<eos> I don't need you!<eos> Who's there?<eos> Patricia McCready.<eos> From the Light of God Church.<eos> We've met before.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Who's there?<eos> Patricia McCready.<eos> From the Light of God Church.<eos> We've met before.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Well, what are you doin' sittin' in your car in the dark?<eos> I didn't wanna... bother you, I suppose.<eos> You scared of me?<eos> Crazy Kyle Barnes? Rome's own Boo Radley? Is that it?<eos> I'm not afraid of you.
Not after what I saw today.<eos> Reverend caught another live one, huh?<eos> He needs your help.<eos> He won't ask for it.<eos> He thinks he's bein' tested.<eos> It's one thing to hear him talk about it on Sunday, dark forces.<eos> I never imagined what it'd be like face to face.<eos> Yeah, well, he's the expert on all of that, so you're in good hands.<eos> Good night.<eos> What's the matter with you?

Why don't you have the Reverend take you down to Charleston?
OK.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Oh, when they went hunting.<eos> Yes, that's Martín right there.<eos> Martín doesn't seem too keen on holding the gun, does he?<eos> I don't think Martín would like us to use this one.<eos> It's too personal.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Everyone's eaten already.<eos> What about you?
Where did you get him?<eos> He was selected among many candidates.<eos> He has great taste, I think.<eos> And it must be either one side or another?<eos> Either up or down?<eos> Outside?<eos> Inside?<eos> Sun?<eos> Moon?<eos> Which one do you prefer?
Give me another clue.<eos> Ok.<eos> Sky.<eos> Sky?<eos> Sky.<eos> Give me another clue!<eos> Shall we change the subject?<eos> - Wanna see the end of the spot?<eos> - Yes. Sure.<eos> I have something to tell you.
- Right?<eos> - Right.<eos> A bit slow, is it?<eos> How long?<eos> - Half an hour?<eos> - We'll try.<eos> - Ok.<eos> - We'll try.<eos> Let's go and come back in half and hour.<eos> Well, I can give you a tour of the house.
You and your personal taste.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Why?<eos> Enrique tells me you want a Party of your own.<eos> It's not a traditional Party.<eos> But I do want to talk about that a bit.<eos> Shall we nibble on something?<eos> Are you Mateo?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - A girl is here for you.
- I'll ask you to clear the area, please.<eos> - OK. She's coming in.<eos> Laura Ambrosio.<eos> This is Laura Ambrosio, the agency's coordinator.<eos> Oh, wow, she's adorable!<eos> - Who else?<eos> - Well, we have the creative team, our consultant, an excellent team.<eos> - Lovely.<eos> You're all lovely.<eos> - Hi. Eloísa, if you want, we can show you what we have so far.
A bit more there.<eos> MARTÍN GOES HIS OWN WAY<eos> Well. Let's stop.<eos> We'll find a solution, OK?<eos> We can go watch it in the shade or indoors.<eos> Anyway, we already... we have a major advertising agency.<eos> They've worked for us for a long time.<eos> Posters, everything.<eos> - Did we bring anything to show them?<eos> We used a photo of you from your internet profile.
Was there a change of profile after this new platform of yours?<eos> No.<eos> Sebas?<eos> They tell me our latest posts are weird.<eos> But we always make that kind of posts.<eos> A bit irreverent but collected.<eos> The idea is to manage the networks together, with a smooth transition.<eos> But the accounts are mine.<eos> To my name.<eos> I won't give you the passwords.
Do you know how many people would like to be in your shoes?<eos> We can use all the help we can get.<eos> The others' lack of responsibilty forces us to take our place in history, Martín.<eos> Nothing relevant so far.<eos> I have projects and commitments as well.<eos> Really?<eos> Which ones?<eos> I don't know, gun control, banning Rottweilers, things related to the environment.<eos> Martín, you go from one extreme to another.<eos> We are offering you a place for development.
I'll have to settle for some rump steak.<eos> - Ro? - Precisely. Mateo.<eos> Not a romp, though.<eos> We have your girlfriend.<eos> Excuse me, that's my accountant.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Don't know.<eos> What were you doing?<eos> Is everything OK?<eos> Yes, I wanted a word with you.
- I got it.<eos> I got it. - Here, here.<eos> Get them out. - The tools are here.<eos> Precisely. Get them out.<eos> This way.<eos> You look familiar.<eos> From the video chat.<eos> Oh, the computer.<eos> She's the kid's girlfriend.<eos> How are you?
They took her and the Flame to the tower.<eos> It's a safe bet Ontari's there, too.<eos> Everything we need to stop A.L.I.E. is in the same place.<eos> If we go up that tower, we won't be able to fight our way out again.<eos> If we stop A.L.I.E., we won't have to.<eos> Up the tower.<eos> Great.<eos> You know, after this doing the right thing can kiss my ass.<eos> Hey!<eos> I told you, that is not how we're doing this.
Never miss my regular game.<eos> No matter what.<eos> Last night was no exception.<eos> Here I thought gambling was a sin.<eos> Aren't you afraid of the consequences?<eos> Reverend don't sweat the small stuff.<eos> No, that's right.<eos> What's a friendly game of cards when your day job is facing the prince of darkness?<eos> Helps keep everything in perspective.<eos> Now, I'd be happy to make a seat at the table for you.
See a doctor about that.<eos> What, about this? Or this?<eos> Whichever.<eos> You believe me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe the devil was in that mine.<eos> But what does that matter now?<eos> We've gotta focus on what's going on in this town right now.<eos> I believe Sidney's one of 'em, and he's not alone.<eos> I mean, I'm with you, Rev, I am.
Oh, it's all right.<eos> It's all right, yeah.<eos> There. Open wide.<eos> Well, good mornin'!<eos> I'm placing you under arrest for assault.<eos> Come on down here and keep them hands where I can see.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Any shit you do say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> You have a right to an attorney.<eos> If you can't afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.

You need some help?<eos> Oh, I'm just gonna call Lenny, have him come change it for me.<eos> Who knows how long that'll take?<eos> You know him.<eos> Where do you wanna go?<eos> I'll be fine. Thank you.<eos> I understand.<eos> Don't wanna be seen hopping' in the car with the... town lunatic.<eos> Well, it had crossed my mind.<eos> You'd be helping salvage my reputation if you were to let me do you a good turn.
Anderson's lost his mind, everyone knows it.<eos> He's over at Kyle Barnes' place with some woman right now.<eos> He's probably raping' her or somethin'.<eos> What woman?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Kyle. Been waitin' for you.<eos> What did you do?<eos> You both are gonna pay for this.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> No one's gonna hurt you.
Kat Ogden is... still in there.<eos> How do you know?<eos> He knows.<eos> He knows what we are.<eos> How?<eos> You've been talkin' to him, haven't you?<eos> That's not how it is.<eos> You've been lettin' him get inside of your head... because that's what he does.<eos> You think you know what this is about.<eos> Reverend, I'm telling you, you're wrong.
Hell, he can take my truck. He can even take my badge, but he ain't taking your ring.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You can pick up your personal items from the front desk.<eos> I ain't got much in the way of family, so my friends mean a lot to me.<eos> I will cross the line to protect them.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> You're offering me a seat in my own home?<eos> This house belongs to God and the people of this congregation.<eos> Not you.
Look... if you promise you make a good go of it at this school,<eos> I promise I won't lie to you about Mommy. Or anything else ever.<eos> That's the honest truth.<eos> I promise.<eos> Oh, thank you, baby.<eos> Good morning, Florence.<eos> Reverend Anderson. I just need a few minutes of your time.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, Reverend, I'm already really running late.<eos> Florence, please.<eos> If anyone sees me talking to you...
You should leave now.<eos> Yes, Reverend... you really should go.<eos> What the hell is he doing here?<eos> Do you have any idea what you have done inviting the devil into God's house? Oh, no.<eos> Sidney has come to make a donation.<eos> His decision to forgive your insults should be a lesson in kindness and charity.<eos> How can you be so blind?<eos> This man is pretending to be one of us, but he is not! John, that's it! He is not one of us!<eos> - That is enough out of you!<eos> - I will not allow you to poison anymore souls with your hatred and bile!
It's been his plan all along.<eos> Well, if you knew that, then why'd you fall for it?<eos> It's not every day you get to punch the devil in the face.<eos> Why isn't he in handcuffs?<eos> Look, mister. Since there's no real harm done, I suggest we forgo all the usual legal formalities.<eos> Why would we do that?<eos> That man there, I've known for the better part of 20 years.<eos> But you... you, I don't know from Adam.<eos> Now, I warned you once about messing with my friends.<eos> Don't make me show you just how little patience I really have.
A fresh start.<eos> I'm gonna be a mom!<eos> Again.<eos> Maybe after this one, we'll try for a third, huh?<eos> - Oh, don't make me hurt you!<eos> - Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Can I help you?
I saw it.<eos> It was black.<eos> And it was cold.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Amber!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Do we have to stay here?<eos> That's right, sweetheart.<eos> I promised you answers!
Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna go find Jesse before Zoom does... again.<eos> Wait, you found her? How?<eos> Cellular dead zones, remote... people from my Earth vibrate at a different frequency than people from your Earth.<eos> They leave cellular dead zones wherever they go.<eos> That's why I'm always dropping calls around you?<eos> Okay, so... so wait, how did that help?<eos> I track the dead zones created by Jesse since she got here and I follow the trail.<eos> It's easy.<eos> What, so you think you're gonna need that gun to convince her to leave with you?
But you should.<eos> I'm one of your mistakes.<eos> One of your sins coming home to roost.<eos> All right, you think I...<eos> I'm from...<eos> I'm not...<eos> I'm not who you think I am.<eos> I know exactly who you are.<eos> And you're gonna fix what your particle accelerator did to me.<eos> What did the accelerator do to you?
All right, you think I...<eos> I'm from...<eos> I'm not...<eos> I'm not who you think I am.<eos> I know exactly who you are.<eos> And you're gonna fix what your particle accelerator did to me.<eos> What did the accelerator do to you?<eos> That.<eos> Well, that's impressive.<eos> And all things considered, I don't know that having that kind of strength is the worst thing you could have been given.
And it was a lot of fun.<eos> Till I learned it did something else to me, too.<eos> That's me.<eos> Last year.<eos> You're... you're ageing.<eos> If this keeps happening, I'll be dead in a few months.<eos> How old are you, Griffin?<eos> I'm 18.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm sorry this is happening to you.
And now, I don't know.<eos> I don't...<eos> I just don't even know who I am anymore or who I'm supposed to be.<eos> Barry, you're supposed to be the same guy that you've always been.<eos> Suit or no suit... that guy is a hero.<eos> That's everything you asked for.<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> Knowing you've destroyed so many people's lives?<eos> I don't.<eos> Do you have anyone in your life that you care about?
But after I got hit by that wave from the particle accelerator, all my dreams ended.<eos> You know, I see her sometimes, walking down the street.<eos> She doesn't even recognize me.<eos> But why would she?<eos> I look as old as her dad.<eos> - You robbed me of her. - Griffin.<eos> Stop talking.<eos> So I can concentrate.<eos> Wake up, man.<eos> This city is screwed up because of you.
I look as old as her dad.<eos> - You robbed me of her. - Griffin.<eos> Stop talking.<eos> So I can concentrate.<eos> Wake up, man.<eos> This city is screwed up because of you.<eos> It was quiet and normal.<eos> Until you rode in on your high horse, talking about science and changing the future.<eos> You didn't stop to think about what your particle accelerator could do to others.<eos> You only thought about what it could do for you.
Hopefully, one gimme punch is all I'll need.<eos> Finished.<eos> This is gonna cure me?<eos> As we say in science, I'm cautiously optimistic.<eos> You know, I learned a lot about chemistry in the past two years.<eos> Is that right?<eos> And I know all you've been doing is diluting that compound for the past half hour.<eos> You don't know how to help me, do you?<eos> There is no helping you.<eos> I told you you were gonna fix me or you were dead!
Come on.<eos> Hold.<eos> What are you lot playing at?<eos> In the name of the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic,<eos> I demand you open the gates.<eos> The gates are open, but not to the likes of you bowsies.<eos> Do yourself a favour and get out of here before you land yourself in some real trouble.<eos> PATRICK:<eos> This is your last warning.<eos> And I'm telling you that this is your last warning.
This hotel has been commandeered in the name of the Provisional Government of the Irish Republic.<eos> CHARLES: The what?<eos> Run it right through, hoist her high.<eos> I suppose you're taking us hostage, are you?<eos> Give them a hand there, give them a hand.<eos> Well, not unless you'd like us to, sir.<eos> No, we're going to hang the Starry Plough outside the front of this bastard William Martin Murphy's Imperial fucking Hotel.<eos> Come on, Charles, they're just boys dressed up as soldiers.<eos> Well, rather a citizen soldier than an Englishman's whore.<eos> - How dare you, you take that back!
You need to take the first staircase on the right,<eos> - second staircase on the left.<eos> - Dr Lynn, we need to retreat now.<eos> No, we've been ordered to hold the building.<eos> We're all going to die if we stay here.<eos> - Our deaths will be symbolic.<eos> - Symbolic of what?<eos> Stupidity?<eos> I vote we retreat.<eos> We must follow our orders and I'm ordering you both to hold your positions.
If the military are in control, perhaps I might be free to return home, sir?<eos> We're not going anywhere until this is over, Hammond.<eos> Yes, sir, of course.<eos> Gretta, the door.<eos> But it might be the rebels, madam, or the Germans.<eos> I don't think either are the type to ring before entering.<eos> It'll be word from Charles, go.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> Can I help you?
Doubled in price since yesterday.<eos> Hope they remember all this when all this is done.<eos> One shouldn't let one's left hand know what one's right hand is doing, or don't you have that line in your Bible?<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> We could do with some full-time help.<eos> We haven't any letters of recommendation with us.<eos> - Minnie, is it?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Why don't we try?<eos> Sylvester will find you a uniform.
You're shipping out for France straightaway.<eos> Who's taking...<eos> What about me son's funeral?<eos> Look, Mahon, if you want to make a run for it, I can look the other way, tell them I couldn't find you.<eos> No.<eos> No, I can't, it's not an option.<eos> Me wife relies on the separation money.<eos> Ah, then good luck.<eos> Papers, please.<eos> Can I help you, sir?
I was finished.<eos> GEORGE: Would you like a cigarette?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Why are you here, Mr Wilson?<eos> GEORGE: A courtesy, Mr Pearse.<eos> The senior prosecutor, Mr Wiley, has asked me to inform you of the charges you and your fellow leaders face.<eos> The charge is of assisting His Majesty's enemies in a time of war.<eos> A capital offence.<eos> That's very kind of him, but please tell Mr Wiley that I'm in no need of a defence counsel.<eos> In a field court martial you will not be entitled to such.

She was sad.<eos> Because of the disappearance of sergeant Newman.<eos> And I thought to cheer him up in...<eos> What happens to sergeant Newman?<eos> Oh, sorry, I spoiled.<eos> "He's not gonna die?"<eos> Secret of production.<eos> I can not say.<eos> Not Newman.<eos> Here, I brought you that.
But I'm fighting for my daughter to live. In a world where all children dream.<eos> I can change my job,<eos> I can make sure she does not miss a school day.<eos> I can even learn English, if you will, but I implore you,<eos> do not take my daughter away.<eos> Do not tear my heart away.<eos> Do not do that.<eos> That's all.<eos> The question is: "What is the interest of the child?"<eos> That is the only question we are asking. The only one we have to answer. Before you today.

The only one we have to answer. Before you today.<eos> In our soul and conscience, we decided unanimously. That the guard of Gloria should return...<eos> To the parent she knows best.<eos> We give you custody of your daughter, sir.
- Hello.<eos> - Hello sir.<eos> Hello madam.<eos> The father of...<eos> It's before all.<eos> A new member of our institution. The staff must therefore accommodate it.<eos> "Do not worry, madam, I'll make you forget."<eos> I do not think it's a good idea to...<eos> Come and think in my office.<eos> I will explain to you in private.
But it turned out the hack had nothing to do with Vincent.<eos> But it could have, Detective.<eos> Listen, Cat...<eos> Is it Cath or Catherine?<eos> Either is fine.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Neither one of us can afford any more high-profile attempts at capturing your husband.<eos> They may be after a beast, but they do not know it's Vincent yet.<eos> But I do, and I'm covering for him.<eos> Just like Agent Russo did, and if it's all the same to you, I don't want to get skinned alive, too.

It's all taken care of.<eos> You don't work at NYPD anymore.<eos> You work for me now.<eos> Keller?<eos> Hey.<eos> How's it going?<eos> What do we got?<eos> Oh. Don't worry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Someone will be right with you.
Okay.<eos> Someone will be right with you.<eos> So, how's Heather?<eos> Uh, Nurse, admit patient to Trauma 5, put him on anti-coags and get him to Imaging, okay?<eos> Do you know if she got the bouquet of flowers I sent?<eos> Which one? You sent four.<eos> Too much, right?<eos> Ah. Think I'm trying too hard?<eos> Look, Kyle, I'm on a double shift.<eos> I'm juggling a lot here, okay? So, if you wouldn't mind.
haven't you... You're supposed to be studying Astral Projection.<eos> Now, here is what I know.<eos> I fell like less of a pussy if I don't cower in fear of my own ability.<eos> I mean, if I supposed to ever be able to travel, like really Travel between worlds, I need... I need to be able to master this Earth-bound small potato shit first.<eos> Is something else going on?<eos> I know that you were close with Kady.<eos> Not as close as you'd think.<eos> You know I-I have a great idea.<eos> I mean, you're so worried about me, why don't you come Travel with me?<eos> You teach me... and I know there's a few things I can teach you, too.
Not as close as you'd think.<eos> You know I-I have a great idea.<eos> I mean, you're so worried about me, why don't you come Travel with me?<eos> You teach me... and I know there's a few things I can teach you, too.<eos> I don't think that would be appropriate.<eos> Oh, I totally agree.<eos> When do we leave?<eos> You're going to be late for your next class.<eos> Your first semester with Brakebills was dedicated to learning the fundamentals of magic.<eos> We gave you the tools.
The books are a child's drawing of Fillory.<eos> The real thing is stranger.<eos> Yeah, it's full of psychopathic monsters who are trying to kill me.<eos> You want to know what the Beast wants? I'll tell you exactly.<eos> He wants control of Fillory and all the doors that lead there.<eos> Maybe, he thinks you'll find one of them.<eos> - I'm not a Traveler. - There are other ways.<eos> I gave you a book about it.<eos> "Fillory and Further, Book Six"?<eos> I told you. I lost it.
We've been writing their speeches since they took office.<eos> We know what we're doing.<eos> Well, do you want it to be good, or do you want it to be yours?<eos> The vote I'm most excited about is the victory our background check legislation got in the House yesterday.<eos> So I'm hoping that the Senate will follow their lead soon, and that the president can sign it into law.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you for inviting us.<eos> No.<eos> It's me who has to thank you and your son.

You want Claire to win, not Durant.<eos> A First Lady as the...<eos> That's ludicrous.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - And I don't think you do either. - Oh.<eos> Maybe I'm wrong.<eos> But if I'm right, she's gonna need the speech to end all speeches.<eos> It would be good for me to know that.<eos> I have some more work to do.<eos> Governor! How are you?
And like I said this morning, I encourage everyone, including Texas, to vote for Secretary Durant.<eos> Mrs. Underwood...<eos> You know what, if you'll excuse me, I want to get back to the phones, make sure Cathy gets this nomination.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - May I have a moment?<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Did anyone ask you about Brandenburg or any of your people and your involvement there?<eos> Brandenburg?<eos> No, we put that to bed.<eos> That's what I thought, which is why I was surprised when Adam Gould told me that he had sources saying you deserved all the credit.
Ignoring, which is the same as confirming.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Claire in there?<eos> She's speaking privately with the president.<eos> I'm sure she won't mind.<eos> Where are we with LeAnn?<eos> - She's clean.<eos> I refuse to believe that.<eos> Doug, if our campaign manager bites the dust, that hurts us.<eos> I gave you a task.

So she's in on this?<eos> She will be.<eos> Well, let's say Claire does take the lead, however unlikely that may be...<eos> - Very unlikely, I would say.<eos> - Let's say she does. What do you propose?<eos> I honestly don't know.<eos> Well...<eos> You'd have to support her, wouldn't you?<eos> You can't abandon your own wife.<eos> True, but I can't abandon you either.
General, your service to this country is greatly valued and your patriotism is without doubt.<eos> And in the heat of the campaign, well, we went too far.<eos> We issued statements that we shouldn't have, and for that I want to apologize, and I do hope that you will accept it.<eos> Far more important to rne than an apology is eliminating ICO, Mr. President.<eos> I couldn't agree with you more, General.<eos> If you'd be so kind as to put the governor back on the phone.<eos> I received your invitation, Mr. President.<eos> And will you join us, Governor?<eos> Only if it leads to real action, not just talk.<eos> FRANCIS". I can promise you, Governor, and the rest of America that it will not just be talk.

I can promise you, Governor, and the rest of America that it will not just be talk.<eos> Then, yes.<eos> If it truly leads to securing our freedom.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> I look forward to seeing you. Thank you all very much.
I'm good, but thanks.<eos> Really?<eos> After the stunt you just pulled, I would've thought you love ham.<eos> You put this here on purpose.<eos> Well, a little reading material, you know.<eos> Something to pass the time.<eos> I just got a text from Ben Grant saying searches for this issue is going through the roof since we showed up here.<eos> Ben Grant owns Pollyhop...<eos> That's right.<eos> And you own Ben Grant.
It feels a bit desperate, doesn't it?<eos> You're 15 points behind in every poll.<eos> So, if anyone's desperate, it should be you.<eos> The key to being president is not only winning your battles, it's winning them with dignity.<eos> - Should we talk about ICO?<eos> - God.<eos> Why would we want to do that?<eos> It's why we're meeting.<eos> Oh, right. "Real talk, real action."<eos> That's what you're all about, isn't it?
You'd be the new JFK.<eos> And if you were a Republican, who'd you be?<eos> Nixon?<eos> Nixon was a far more effective president.<eos> The only reason people glorify Kennedy is because he got shot.<eos> You've got that going for you, too, now, don't you?<eos> And you've got your search engine and all your little home videos.<eos> See, if people want a piece of you, you give it to them, right?<eos> Ch. Is that what people want?<eos> A piece of you?
Who was that?<eos> The president.<eos> He just wanted the latest delegate count.<eos> ...and we're minutes away from the next ballot.<eos> Here's a graphic of the last round yesterday.<eos> Secretary Catherine Durant led the way with 22% of delegates.<eos> Doug hates it.<eos> That you have direct access to the president without going through him.<eos> He wants you gone.<eos> Doug told you that?
Then again, when opportunity strikes...<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Definitely not the way to win with dignity.<eos> ...Durant commenting on her home state of Louisiana.<eos> If you win at all.<eos> We should get back out there.<eos> You've got a nomination to fight for.<eos> The president and I, we had a great talk. We even watched the vote together.<eos> But I'm sure you'd rather hear from him on that than me.<eos> Well, thank you, Governor.
- Can I get gas money, at least?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Hello, Chip.<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> That's no way to speak to a lady.<eos> You're right.<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> Fuck, man. You're Vanessa Weiss.<eos> The super agent!<eos> I sent you a tape a couple years ago 'cause I'm, like...
We have a mutual friend. And who that? Deborah Gorn, of the orphanage on Worcester Street.<eos> - Come, Matilda. We'll be late.<eos> - She asks herself why it is you have not sought her out since your return, wonders if that return is motivated by the execution of your other mutual friend<eos> Mr. Bloom, if the murder of the rabbi Ratovski still occupies that restless mind of yours.<eos> As you know, that case is now closed.<eos> And yet so much of its detail still stands injuncted, withheld from the public by the unseen hand of police officialdom. Why is that, sir?<eos> If indeed that case is closed?<eos> Will you now leave us, Miss Castello?<eos> Or allow us to leave you?<eos> And a good day to you, Miss Matilda Reid.
Some graft for you, if you would.<eos> Tell me how my business stands, for I confess it, I have lost count.<eos> There is every barrel, every spice, every last cotton bale of the Empire forgotten somewhere in here. Yeah?<eos> 10 years past, my blood would have roared for you.<eos> Proud, old lion you are now, though. Aye, but blunted claws.<eos> I lost my boy. I know where he lies.<eos> It's a bright spot beside the trees, where birds sing.<eos> Why do you weep, sir?<eos> The comfort you have for your son,<eos> You're a mighty heart.
She's on an oxygen tank and a tube in her nose.<eos> So, tell me, is she ever gonna see her son alive again?<eos> She gonna have to read about you lying dead in a ditch somewhere?<eos> He'll do what you want.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I found Eric O'Bannon.<eos> He's willing to give you up.<eos> He doesn't know shit.<eos> He can tie the drugs on you... on those girls that burned on that boat... and maybe even Danny.
He's willing to give you up.<eos> He doesn't know shit.<eos> He can tie the drugs on you... on those girls that burned on that boat... and maybe even Danny.<eos> I already told you I didn't kill your brother.<eos> You had something to do with it.<eos> - We're done here.<eos> - Hey, Wayne.<eos> You know, the people that you work for, they gotta be mighty pissed that your drugs are out on the street right now.<eos> And Eric O'Bannon going and running his mouth to the feds, that's not gonna make them any happier.<eos> I mean, fuck, they're giving you an awful lot of rope, aren't they?
We couldn't do what we do without Cisco. Oh, he's loyal.<eos> Just like a dog.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> My speed for Wally's life.<eos> Hand him over, and it's yours.<eos> The Speed Force is leaving his body.<eos> He's becoming human again. Aah!<eos> I know some piece of you did care for me.<eos> Please, let him go.<eos> - You are gonna get your speed back, Allen, and I'm gonna help you do that.
You know how to contain a dark matter explosion that, last time, just radiated all of Central City?<eos> You tried this on your Earth, remember?<eos> Didn't go so well.<eos> And, even if you could contain it, I thought you said that Barry couldn't tap into the Speed Force anymore.<eos> It wasn't connected the first time he got his powers.<eos> Look, I have your Wells's data.<eos> The Harrison Wells from this Earth, I have his science.<eos> I know what chemicals need to be in your body.<eos> I know how the lightning needs to bond with the dark matter from the particle accelerator explosion.<eos> I can recreate the circumstances to get you your speed back.
That's what we're gonna rely on?<eos> Snow talking him out of it?<eos> Joe, you need to get those guys out of there.<eos> What if they set up at Jitters?<eos> That's a good idea... it's just a block away from the precinct.<eos> And then what?<eos> What happens next?<eos> You saw what Zoom did on my Earth.<eos> He will do the exact same thing here.<eos> Barry, we need to get you your powers back.
- Joe, let me do something.<eos> Wally, there isn't anything you can do right now.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> Okay, well, what about the... bathroom?<eos> Wally and Jesse are all good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So this is what it takes to get Barry his speed back.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> It's not uncomplicated, but almost there.<eos> I told you before, once Barry makes up his mind, it's impossible to change it.
How do you know about the Harry Potter convention?<eos> - Get the wand.<eos> Get on the roof.<eos> - Why the roof?<eos> Because we're gonna need a lightning rod, and that, Ramon, is gonna be you.<eos> All right, I'm on the roof.<eos> Wow. I've never actually been up here before.<eos> I think I can see my apartment from here.<eos> Now head straight to the satellite, Ramon.<eos> When I give you the signal, you're gonna create a lightning storm above you.
Maybe you've got more to hide than I thought.<eos> You sure as hell don't want me playing that tape for your friends.<eos> We had an understanding.<eos> You walked away from that understanding.<eos> So, why don't you tell me exactly what the fuck is it we're doing here?<eos> I'm getting back into business... and you're gonna help me do it.<eos> I'm planning a run.<eos> I need information:<eos> Where the Feds are looking, and where they're blind.<eos> And if I don't hear from you, I tell my story.
Yeah.<eos> Confession.<eos> Of course.<eos> Shit, that would take balls.<eos> Even I'd be impressed by that.<eos> But if you confess, then everyone's gonna know.<eos> What will they know?<eos> John Rayburn's a lie.<eos> Mrs. Rayburn?<eos> There's a lady asking for you.
But if you confess, then everyone's gonna know.<eos> What will they know?<eos> John Rayburn's a lie.<eos> Mrs. Rayburn?<eos> There's a lady asking for you.<eos> She's interested in a room.<eos> - Just show her around.<eos> - She asked to see the owner.<eos> Okay, Manny, I'll be right there.<eos> May I help you?
I heard this was a nice place.<eos> We like to think so.<eos> In town they said I should talk to the lady of the house.<eos> Well, that's me, I guess.<eos> I'm Sally.<eos> Well, I'm looking for a place to stay.<eos> I thought maybe you could show me around.<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> Follow me.<eos> I'll give you the tour.
These days, I do.<eos> I have a staff, of course.<eos> I really admire that. Strong woman running her own business, doing her own thing.<eos> Kind of independent that way, myself.<eos> What do you do?<eos> I'm a musician, mostly.<eos> - I'm a songwriter.<eos> - Oh, well, that's nice.<eos> This is pretty much the place.<eos> If you want, we can stop by the office and I can show you what's available.
Not that we were...<eos> I mean, we didn't have much of a relationship.<eos> Not for a while.<eos> But he'd come by sometimes and see his kid, and...<eos> Every blue moon send some money.<eos> Well, that's nice.<eos> Well, it wasn't much to speak of, but yeah, he tried sometimes.<eos> Raising a kid on my own...<eos> Kids are expensive.<eos> I mean, I don't need to tell you that, but...
Well, that's nice.<eos> Well, it wasn't much to speak of, but yeah, he tried sometimes.<eos> Raising a kid on my own...<eos> Kids are expensive.<eos> I mean, I don't need to tell you that, but...<eos> I want Nolan to go to college.<eos> Of course.<eos> I know Danny really wanted that, too.<eos> Did you come here for money, Eve?<eos> I told you, I came for Nolan.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news.<eos> It's Wayne Lowry.<eos> He's gone back on the deal.<eos> No deal?<eos> No deal.<eos> May we, uh...?<eos> Absolutely, sí.<eos> - Hold for Ms. Chaffee.<eos> - Hi, Meg.<eos> Hi, Susannah, how are you?
How is...? How's New York?<eos> Good?<eos> New York is so good.<eos> It's such a great city.<eos> That's great.<eos> - Yeah, it's a great city.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, h... Hi, I'm Meg.<eos> - I'm the ex.<eos> - I've heard about you.
Come on.<eos> He saw me singing in a club.<eos> That's how we met.<eos> He said he liked my voice.<eos> That's what I needed to hear.<eos> Then he came and saw me sing in other places and we'd talk after and...<eos> I knew he was trouble.<eos> He was a lot older.<eos> But I loved him.<eos> I'm not gonna give you any money, Eve.
I wasn't any good at it either.<eos> I warned you.<eos> About Danny.<eos> What must it have been like for him to have a son he couldn't take care of?<eos> Probably the same as it was for me.<eos> No, Eve.<eos> You had a choice.<eos> I respect that choice, but it was yours.<eos> Look, I just want what was promised to me.<eos> I didn't promise you anything.
- Where's Lowry?<eos> Inside.<eos> John, come here.<eos> We found this when we got here.<eos> Stabbed at least ten, twelve times.<eos> Haven't found a weapon yet.<eos> You wanted justice?<eos> Lowry's own people just gave it to you.<eos> It's over, John.<eos> We need to talk to you, Vicente.
- Will there be a microphone?<eos> - I'm sure, ma'am.<eos> "Little more than 50 years ago..."<eos> "My husband and I are deeply touched by our welcome here this morning.<eos> Little more than 50 years ago, Nairobi was a savage place, the home of wild animals and uninhabited except for the occasional band of nomadic herdsmen.<eos> Now, it is a modern, vibrant city, a striking tribute to the men and women of all races, who have made it a great center of commerce and finance.<eos> Now, it remains only for me to pass on the apologies of my father, King George..."<eos> Who is, no doubt, very jealous indeed that I have come in his place.<eos> He's getting stronger every day.<eos> And he will be here with you all again very soon.
Consider it given.<eos> - Sorry, ma'am, can I help you?<eos> - Oh, Venetia Scott.<eos> I'm new.<eos> It's all right.<eos> She's with me. Come along.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - He's awake.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Actually, he's asked to see you.
- He's awake.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Actually, he's asked to see you.<eos> - Prime Minister?<eos> - Is that the new girl?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Venetia.<eos> - Louisa?<eos> - Venetia.<eos> - Venetia. Have they told you terrible things, your colleagues downstairs?
- Venetia.<eos> - Venetia. Have they told you terrible things, your colleagues downstairs?<eos> Go on.<eos> Be candid.<eos> It is said... you can be difficult.<eos> I can be a monster.<eos> Did they say that?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - It's true. But you need to be a monster to defeat Hitler.<eos> - Did Jock give you my box?
Ma'am.<eos> Your Royal Highness.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> Come on.<eos> His Majesty will return from the shoot at 4 p.m.<eos> - Good afternoon, sir.<eos> - Good afternoon.<eos> His Majesty wondered if you'd mind accompanying him on the shoot at Beecher's Club today.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Still rather wet underfoot, I'm afraid, after the storms yesterday, but we can provide you with Wellington boots.
Well, that is where we run into difficulties, I'm afraid.<eos> I no longer am Albert Windsor.<eos> That person was murdered by his elder brother... when he abdicated.<eos> And, of course, Albert Windsor would dearly love to say to his old friend, Winston Churchill, "Take a step back.<eos> Put your feet up. Let the younger generation have a go now."<eos> But he is no longer with us and that void has been filled by George the VI who, it turns out, is quite the stickler, and...<eos> no more allow the sovereign to interfere with the Prime Minister than stand for office himself.<eos> Even when it's in the national interest, sir?<eos> The national interests?<eos> The reason I agreed to grant you an audience, not to hear your grievances about Mr. Churchill but to communicate mine about you.
- Morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> The PM will not be joining us this morning.<eos> He is very much tired from all the emotion of yesterday.<eos> - So, where is he?<eos> - He's still asleep.<eos> So, in his absence, as deputy, I will preside.<eos> - The Queen's flight...<eos> - Wait a minute, Anthony.<eos> If you're presiding over the meeting on behalf of the PM, shouldn't you be sitting in the appropriate chair?
Yes, sir.<eos> I mentioned this to the Queen... the Queen Mother, this morning, who then asked me, quite unusually, to ask you whether you might like<eos> - to reconsider such a departure. - Oh, sir?<eos> She felt that you had enjoyed an uncommonly close association with her late husband and earned not just his trust, but the trust and affection of the family.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> In the light of this, she wondered whether you might consider staying on in a new role, as comptroller of the Queen Mother's household.<eos> - I see.<eos> - A kind and generous offer.<eos> As befits the widow of a kind... and generous man.<eos> But, while I'm sure you're flattered, I don't expect you to accept the post.
I'm honored, Mr. President.<eos> I just have one major reservation.<eos> - Claire.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Well, between you and me, I'm not even sure this gun bill is gonna pass.<eos> But if I'm being asked to support it, you know the sort of hot water--<eos> Yes, but I need you on the ticket to balance our stance on guns.<eos> We have to appeal to the Republicans as well.<eos> And look, I'm not asking you to get behind the bill, just not to publicly trash it.<eos> I know this is an important issue to you.
So what do you want?<eos> - A meeting. - For?<eos> You're just a messenger, Doug.<eos> You got your message.<eos> One week.<eos> Thanks for the coffee.<eos> Mrs. Underwood, welcome.<eos> Thank you so much for recording this robocall.<eos> It'll go a long way in getting this bill passed.<eos> Well, thank you for all the extraordinary work you're doing.

- You should pull over.<eos> Did you find out anything?<eos> Anything you can tell me?<eos> She didn't have a lot of friends at the Herald.<eos> Um, from what I can gather, she didn't have any close friends at all.<eos> I spoke to some people in her neighborhood... but nothing so far.<eos> Will you?<eos> - If you...<eos> - Yeah, of course, of course.<eos> If you think of anything...
Now, the leadership wants him, and we've played nice, but the president and I want Cathy Durant.<eos> She's a much stronger candidate.<eos> You're willing to abandon your own bill?<eos> If it's means beating Conway or beating you, that's not a hard choice.<eos> I already told Dean that I could live with him being running mate.<eos> How do I backtrack?<eos> Just watch the news tomorrow.<eos> You made the right choice.<eos> - I hope so. - Well, don't hope so, know so.<eos> And I'll have Seth send you a copy of the speech.
I feel like running for president is like climbing a cliff without a safety rope.<eos> How is it the press don't know you're here, by the way?<eos> Just like you, General,<eos> I take Sundays off to spend time with family and friends.<eos> Or to make new friends.<eos> Look, Governor, I know you still want me to resign.<eos> But I was wrong to threaten that.<eos> Dreyer told me ICO took over another oil field this week.<eos> They're growing.<eos> Dreyer shares a lot with you, doesn't he?
The Telegraph would never let me.<eos> - Same parent company, both our titles.<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> Paper is strict when it comes to moonlighting.<eos> It does matter, because my dad is on the board.<eos> One call to your editor...<eos> There... there are plenty of people who would jump at doing this.<eos> Not who know him intimately.<eos> My new election correspondent, he saw you and Yates sneaking off on the campaign trail.<eos> Yates will open up to you.
I don't believe for a second you went to visit your mother because she was sick.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because you never mentioned her one time to me.<eos> Saying nothing says a lot sometimes.<eos> Well, what if the story isn't about how she left, but how she came back.<eos> Just because you're here doesn't mean you're here.<eos> Well, wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Don't you want your ending?<eos> Are you gonna tell me about it?<eos> About the two of you?

No, I'm not going to tell you anything.
Speeches.<eos> We need someone who knows us... and knows our voices.<eos> A speechwriter?<eos> You're kidding.<eos> It's the only way to justify you being with us... in case the press ask.<eos> You want to keep an eye on me.<eos> Well, I think that's fair.<eos> Don't you?<eos> If you're keeping an eye on us?<eos> So you gave us a week. We'll give you a day.
We're still drafting action items, but we can give you a rough sense--<eos> Well, before we discuss any military options, I'd like to put a call in to Damascus and see what they'll allow.<eos> Madam Secretary, won't you join me?<eos> So you had to call a national security meeting just to get us in the same room?<eos> And to keep you off the phone with Conway.<eos> All I needed was one call to him.<eos> I don't need to make another.<eos> You don't actually think he's gonna make you Secretary of State, do you?<eos> Probably not, but I would've paid good money<eos> - just to see your face when he told you.
I don't need to make another.<eos> You don't actually think he's gonna make you Secretary of State, do you?<eos> Probably not, but I would've paid good money<eos> - just to see your face when he told you.<eos> - Mmm. I never promised you the ticket. I promised you I'd try.<eos> You pretended to try.<eos> Claire's support didn't just happen on its own, and you had the gall to take my hand, look me in the eye and lie to my face.<eos> - You're mistaken, Cathy.<eos> - Oh, come on, Frank.<eos> I've had a front row seat to everything since the day Walker took office, all the lies and betrayals, and I helped you.
I shoplifted a homecoming dress when I was 16,<eos> I experimented with a sorority sister in freshman year, and I was late on my taxes in 2007.<eos> What he won't find is anything that justifies firing me.<eos> I'm sure he was just vetting you.<eos> We do that with everyone.<eos> Okay, if that's your story, then fine, but all I care about is winning this election.<eos> So let's get past our personal shit and be a team, okay?<eos> We're fighting a common enemy here, Mr. President.<eos> It's important that we remain united.<eos> Yeah, and I can assure you that Secretary Durant will reach out before we conduct any operation.
Claire Underwood is formidable."<eos> So, you see, you don't even have time on your side.<eos> It's on ours. By tomorrow morning, there'll be a dozen articles just like that.<eos> So you have a choice.<eos> You can redeem yourself as Secretary of State over the next four years, or go down in history as a fluke, who bungled the Middle East and couldn't even close the deal in Brandenburg.<eos> You have your version.<eos> I have mine. I'm sure mine will get just as much traction as this.<eos> But my version wins because it's the better story... and it's also exactly how things went down.<eos> You see, you don't even have the truth going for you.<eos> I'm not scared of you.
I'm not scared of you.<eos> My endorsement of Dunbar, that makes for an even better story.<eos> But you wanna know what the best story is?<eos> Claire's mother just died.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Oh, I don't think you really are, but that doesn't matter because the rest of the world will.<eos> And by the time she gives her speech tomorrow night, there won't be a dry eye in Atlanta or across the rest of the country.<eos> So, you get to keep your job, Cathy, in return for your delegates. That offer is still on the table.<eos> I have been loyal.<eos> I got you that table.
She's strong.<eos> You're a lucky man.<eos> Don't I know it.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor to introduce<eos> Thank you, thank you very much.<eos> I know that all of you join me in offering our sincere condolences to the First Lady for her loss.<eos> Tonight, I want to offer my sincere gratitude to all the delegates who have honored me with their support during the course of this convention.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> However, after much deliberation... I have decided that I have more to offer you as Secretary of State than to resign and run for office.<eos> But I want to encourage every one of you who has supported me to join me in supporting this extraordinary woman, the First Lady of the United States, Claire Hale Underwood.
If the people want it, listen to them.<eos> And if you lose, then you lose.<eos> But if you win... be honored, be humbled, and win this election with Francis!"<eos> And I told her, I said, "The Conways are tough opponents."<eos> And she said, "They may be tough, but they're not Texas tough."<eos> Loss is a sobering phenomenon.<eos> Several months ago, I almost lost my husband.<eos> Our nation almost lost a president.<eos> Loss makes us reevaluate what we hold dear.<eos> And I'll tell you, there were... times in the not too distant past, where Francis and I, we... almost lost our marriage.

Senator Halston called about the meeting on Tuesday. Wait.<eos> The voicemail.<eos> Uh, Laura Moretti, from the Anthony Moretti Memorial Fund.<eos> - I guess you... donated?<eos> - Cue that up for me.<eos> Just press one when you're ready.<eos> - I'll catch up with you in a little bit. - Okay.<eos> Hi, this is Laura Moretti leaving a message for Douglas Stamper.<eos> I just, uh...<eos> I wanted to reach out to you personally, to say thank you for the incredibly generous donation.
- I'll catch up with you in a little bit. - Okay.<eos> Hi, this is Laura Moretti leaving a message for Douglas Stamper.<eos> I just, uh...<eos> I wanted to reach out to you personally, to say thank you for the incredibly generous donation.<eos> It's the biggest donation we've received.<eos> By a lot.<eos> Uh, I don't know how you found out about us.<eos> Maybe because of the president's transplant.<eos> But whatever the reason, it means so much to us, to me and my children.<eos> Anyway, I... and I know this is a long shot, but if you're ever free for coffee, I'd love to thank you in person.

You should come up here one night and cook us a rack of ribs.<eos> Now, I realize oven-baked isn't nearly as good as the smoker, but you'd make 'em delicious, anyhow.<eos> Ribs?<eos> Really?<eos> You want me to cook ribs for you.<eos> Well, sure, just like old times.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> I'm just the help, ain't I?<eos> - No, that's not true.<eos> - I tell you I got something good going, and your first thought ain't,
You're a motherfucker!<eos> Get out!<eos> My bad, my bad.<eos> You're a motherfucker, Mr. President!<eos> Governor Conway continues to say we're not doing enough about terrorism, but he ignores the fact that ICO has been stopped in its tracks.<eos> The president is working tirelessly to combat our enemies abroad, and what Governor Conway lacks in his assessment... is the decades of experience the president brings...<eos> Do you think you should keep calling him "the president"?<eos> Well, I wanna emphasize that we're running mates, and LeAnn is telling me that the marriage angle isn't working.<eos> Screw the research.<eos> People want to hear the real you, a real person.
- It's just beyond our experience.<eos> - All these folks are our neighbors.<eos> But once I put that sign up...<eos> Governor Conway is a veteran.<eos> He has children.<eos> Why us and not him?<eos> When we saw you two at the convention... I don't know. It just seemed like a real partnership.<eos> Love.<eos> Deep, unwavering love.<eos> I wanna thank you for reminding me how important that kind of love is.
I wanna thank you for reminding me how important that kind of love is.<eos> Because it is.<eos> It's easy to get caught up in the campaign and to forget how Francis and I got here in the first place, to remember that we're not just President and First Lady, or husband and wife.<eos> We're partners.<eos> We have made a choice to tackle everything together.<eos> We go beyond what's pretty and perfect, beyond what's scary, difficult and unknown.<eos> We're not just partners on the ticket.<eos> We're partners in life.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> You have someone on the inside of the House Intelligence Committee feeding you classified information.
But wouldn't you rather have it be Russians in harm's way, than your fellow American soldiers?<eos> If anyone gets killed, that's going to be blood on your hands.<eos> You want me to tell the Republicans to... get on board.<eos> Or have the general do it.<eos> Put politics aside and do the right thing.<eos> Did you really think you'd be able to convince me by making this call, Mr. President?<eos> I'm ahead by double digits.<eos> I got a message that's working.<eos> You're on your heels, and you're asking me to help you by appealing to my sense of duty?<eos> I've even got you sold on my message.
Press Secretary Seth Grayson said, quote,<eos> "The president is attending to the business of government for the time being," end quote.<eos> But he neglected to say when the president would resume campaigning, and there are no upcoming events currently listed on the campaign website, leading some to speculate that the real reason for his absence may be health-related.<eos> It's been six months since the president received a liver transplant.<eos> Although he was able to resume normal...<eos> - What happened to your eye?<eos> - Freddy Hayes.<eos> So I assume he didn't talk.<eos> - I need a way in here, Mr. Danton.<eos> - I've helped you as much as I can.
- Who's corroborated, besides him?<eos> - No one.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I need institutional support.<eos> Legal, research... a place to work where my dog won't bark at me.<eos> If you crack this story, you can do anything you want.<eos> - I'll even make you managing editor again.<eos> - I don't want that.<eos> What I do want... is absolute autonomy.<eos> I build my team, I keep it small, and I answer only to you.
Thank you, Tom.<eos> - I'll walk you out.<eos> - I know my way out.<eos> But thanks.<eos> Take care, Frank.<eos> Three teams. North, east, and west.<eos> We'll triangulate and advance on the center.<eos> Each team will have a field agent working with local assets to locate the Ahmadis.<eos> Here's the executive order, sir.<eos> Do you have a preference?
Oh, I don't need a lecture on reality like I'm a schoolboy, Mrs. Underwood.<eos> I've actually fought in the Middle East.<eos> So has the general.<eos> Our views on international diplomacy aren't just pretty words.<eos> We can debate policy all you'd like, Governor, but there is one thing that is undebatable.<eos> And that is ICO is no longer the threat it once was without their leadership.<eos> - You're not watching the debate?<eos> - I know what they're going to say.<eos> How can I help you, Doug?<eos> I told you there'd be a day.
Are you saying that you did not have the general contact members of the House Intelligence Committee?<eos> General, would you care to comment?<eos> When I resigned my commission, I stopped talking to members of Congress about matters of national security.<eos> - So you are saying that you did not?<eos> - No, ma'am.<eos> I did not.<eos> You and I both know that you interfered, Governor.<eos> You admitted so much to me when I asked you personally.<eos> You told me that the general had spoken to members of that committee.<eos> I told you that I have friends on the committee, which is true.
- And then I come in, and...<eos> - I didn't forget.<eos> I just feel this is wrong.<eos> It implies we're willing to negotiate with terrorists.<eos> We should keep our mouths shut.<eos> Let the authorities do their job.<eos> We don't get press by keeping our mouths shut.<eos> You had me lie on national television.<eos> And now you want us to send out some video that only encourages these people? And you wanna do that to score some press coverage?<eos> If it doesn't make you feel comfortable, I can do it on my own.
When we pumped up the contrast in the video, we saw a shadow on the wall from someone behind the camera.<eos> Voice analysis points to western Tennessee, Memphis area.<eos> Uh, Mr. President, if I may?<eos> Agent Holbrooke, our top negotiating expert.<eos> Uh, we've run 16 possible models in preparation for an incident like this.<eos> Now, what we have here are key elements from three of them.<eos> American kidnappers, the abduction of a child and proxy communication...<eos> Why did they want Conway?<eos> That's the real question.<eos> I'll tell you why.
We're not talking about negotiation, just communication.<eos> You could've asked me privately first.<eos> It was tactical, to show the kidnappers that we respect their wishes.<eos> This doesn't leave me a choice.<eos> Well, you can always say no, Governor.<eos> We have a plan for how we can handle this without your participation.<eos> How would that work?<eos> Well, I say publicly that I'm willing to speak to the captors myself.<eos> Now, if they refuse, we'd have to be prepared for the worst.<eos> But our team believes that you give us a better shot at opening a dialogue.
It's all hands on deck, Doug.<eos> - Governor. - Mr. President.<eos> Well, and this must be Charlie.<eos> Charlie...<eos> Shake the president's hand, Charlie.<eos> - Come on, Charlie.<eos> - You said he was a vampire.<eos> Well, don't worry. You're safe here.<eos> No monsters in the White House.<eos> I'll show you where you're staying.
Well, don't worry. You're safe here.<eos> No monsters in the White House.<eos> I'll show you where you're staying.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on, Charlie.<eos> - Have you ever been in the Oval?<eos> - Once, when I was a kid.<eos> My Boy Scout troop, we met with Reagan.<eos> Of course they did.<eos> I thought you'd all like to be together, so I've put you in here, but, if not, we can put the kids in the Lincoln Bedroom.
I wanted to say Tusk lied.<eos> But once I got the pardon, I knew nobody would believe me.<eos> I thought...<eos> "Just disappear.<eos> Go away."<eos> And that anger...<eos> If I went away... that anger would go away.<eos> The truth is coming out.<eos> Be part of the truth.<eos> People will believe you.
You don't want me on the call if they contact us?<eos> Oh, you're only there for bait, Governor.<eos> I can't have you speaking on behalf of the White House.<eos> - They said they wanted me.<eos> - Yes, we have a roadmap in place.<eos> Then you'll have to adjust it.<eos> What right do you have to walk in here and dictate how we're gonna handle this?<eos> I put myself on the line coming here, and you know it.<eos> I could've backed off and left this pile of shit in your lap.<eos> Now, if I'm gonna be exposed with you, then I'm gonna have some say in how that happens.
Is this going to be a problem?<eos> I'd prefer them not breathing down my neck.<eos> - That wasn't my question.<eos> - I told you, we're masked.<eos> Thank you. Please be seated.<eos> I'd like to thank Governor Conway for agreeing to assist us.<eos> He and I share the same goal, which is the safe return of the Millers.<eos> In order to achieve that, we're willing to open up lines of communication with their captors.<eos> Governor.<eos> I will act as intermediary between you and the president.
Either you give us what we want or we kill them.<eos> Nothing will happen until we have proof of life.<eos> All right, here's your proof of life.<eos> Cut out the girl's tongue. - No!<eos> - This is Conway.<eos> - Please, before you do anything...<eos> - Mommy!<eos> Zach.<eos> Do you think we care you know who we are? No, stop!<eos> I'd like to speak with you, just for a moment.
- One of Masterson's classmates.<eos> Should we just release their photographs at this point?<eos> I'm getting bombarded with calls.<eos> Well, the governor used the first names.<eos> Someone's gonna put it together.<eos> - We might as well exploit it.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - George.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> Normally, I'd give you time to reconsider, but time is in short supply today.
- Mr. President.<eos> Normally, I'd give you time to reconsider, but time is in short supply today.<eos> - I can't.<eos> Not to my party.<eos> - The party will survive.<eos> Conway might not, but too bad.<eos> He lied.<eos> If I do this to him, I don't survive.<eos> I'm vilified.<eos> I wanna show you something.
That's gotta drive you crazy, huh? How much good press I'm getting out of this.<eos> - What's funny?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Come on, tell me.<eos> I want in on the joke.<eos> You think you can get under my skin.<eos> Oh, I got under your skin the first time we met.<eos> - When?<eos> New Year's? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> I believe I complimented you that night.
There's fresh clothes in the closet.<eos> The only people who know are the Chairman and the SEALs who escorted him.<eos> - Do we have a secure line?<eos> - Direct to the Oval.<eos> Mr. President...<eos> I would have never condoned bringing Ahmadi into this.<eos> Well, lucky for me, I'm not making decisions based on what you would or would not condone.<eos> Watch me tell the press you put words in my mouth.<eos> Feel free.<eos> I think they'll have a hard time believing you, though.
And why you?<eos> Out of respect...<eos> for the gravity of this situation.<eos> I think your intention is to humiliate me.<eos> You've been properly clothed, offered food.<eos> How are we humiliating you?<eos> I'm sitting across from a woman.<eos> There's no reason to keep up the facade.<eos> You and your brother are not fundamentalists, nor are you Syrian.<eos> This what the CIA's feeding you?
We'll fill in the blanks once we have details.<eos> This is if the worst happens.<eos> Yates wrote these?<eos> No, I...<eos> I took a stab at it first.<eos> Also, Tom Hammerschmidt called.<eos> He wants an interview with the president. He wouldn't say what for.<eos> What outlet is he with now?<eos> He's back at the Herald.<eos> Said he emailed you directly.
Well, there's a cell tower here.<eos> Uh, typically very low traffic, but it showed higher usage during the time of the call, especially the southeastern antenna.<eos> So we should be able to ping the hotspot, zero in?<eos> Eh, it's hundreds of tower faces.<eos> I can give you the general area, but pinpointing will take longer.<eos> I can't even guarantee it's gonna be them.<eos> I want every one of those towers analyzed.<eos> Well, we're better off concentrating on ambient background sound.<eos> If I can match that to other calls made in this area around the same time as...<eos> I'm not asking your advice. I'm telling you what I want you to do.
- No, we're trying to find her.<eos> She usually keeps me informed if she's going somewhere.<eos> Have you asked Secret Service? - They didn't know.<eos> - They have to know.<eos> I'll go ask again.<eos> Thanks.<eos> She wasn't at the residence.<eos> - You went up there?<eos> - Ten minutes ago.<eos> What's going on between you two?
- How's your end?<eos> He's getting there.<eos> Well, you focus on him. I'll handle Hammerschmidt.<eos> Are you smoking?<eos> - How did you know?<eos> - I can hear it.<eos> If this story comes out, it won't be the smoking that does us in.<eos> Have they been killed?<eos> You look upset.<eos> Do you miss your wife?

I'll handle Hammerschmidt.<eos> Are you smoking?<eos> - How did you know?<eos> - I can hear it.<eos> If this story comes out, it won't be the smoking that does us in.<eos> Have they been killed?<eos> You look upset.<eos> Do you miss your wife?<eos> You don't care about my wife.
Will you please show Mr. Hammerschmidt into the Roosevelt Room?<eos> There's no need. I'll be going.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> You and I are not done, Tom.<eos> Caroline and Melissa Miller were rescued at approximately 12:30 Eastern Standard Time by FBI field agents.<eos> Aside from the psychological trauma of their ordeal, both are unharmed and healthy.<eos> I'll be calling them soon, and I hope to meet them soon, once they have had their full medical examinations.<eos> And while I am greatly relieved to have them both safe, James Miller remains in danger.<eos> And we will not rest until I can come to this podium and make another announcement like this one, informing you of his safe return.<eos> Mr. Grayson will answer any questions you may have.
You remind me a little bit of Kate Baldwin.<eos> You've lost your objectivity.<eos> Uh, it's funny you mention her.<eos> Kate thought Lucas was onto something.<eos> I told her to let it go, that there wasn't anything there, but there was.<eos> Well, where are the facts?<eos> Facts, not quotes.<eos> Facts. You wanna see a fact?<eos> This is a fact.<eos> I told you he was crazy, and there's the proof.
Because the country had to move on.<eos> You didn't orchestrate his impeachment?<eos> Why would I want to impeach a president I was working so hard to help?<eos> You're still here.<eos> I was trying to save him from himself.<eos> Unfortunately, I failed.<eos> - Do you trust your instincts, Tom?<eos> - I always have.<eos> Then look me in the eye.<eos> I've told you the truth.
We need to stabilize. I don't think he should say the part about mourning and grief.<eos> I agree, but Yates said they wanted it back in.<eos> Is it true?<eos> What Hammerschmidt wrote?<eos> Is it? No.<eos> That's the first time you've lied to me... since you stopped lying to me.<eos> My fellow Americans, over the past two years, certainly within the last several days and hours,<eos> I have asked myself, "What does it mean to be president?<eos> What does true leadership look like?"<eos> It's a question many of you have asked yourselves as November approaches.
- Hey.<eos> Do you want to come inside?<eos> - The kids there?<eos> - You're not letting them watch...<eos> - No.<eos> No, I forbade them to.<eos> Although, I mean, with school and...<eos> and their friends, it'll be impossible to prevent if... if they really wanna see it.<eos> They all right?<eos> Are you all right?
There's got to be a way.<eos> I got to go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The team's assembling at the Stonefish Tavern, all right?<eos> Okay, well, I'll try and keep the drones away from there, too.<eos> We will find a way, I promise.<eos> To happily ever after.<eos> I have a few questions.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Glad to see DHS still trusts you, all things considered.
Nobody, of course, will talk on the record at DHS, but I've got my sources.<eos> Plus, it doesn't take a reporter to notice that both Hill and your husband mysteriously disappeared.<eos> Smells like a cover-up to me.<eos> Friendly reminder: you're talking to DHS now.<eos> Actually, I'm hoping I'm talking to a wife.<eos> Because I don't get the sense after everything I've learned that you're the type to betray your husband, hunt him down. On the contrary.<eos> I'm guessing you'd do everything you could to help him, which means you must think he's innocent.<eos> Who are you kidding?<eos> All you care about is a story.<eos> You don't care if it's right. You just care that it's sensational.
Because we've been infiltrated, that's how.<eos> That's why we met off-site, because we knew we had a leak.<eos> But now, we've been ordered to stand down until we find out who it is, and while you find out how much the reporter knows about what we were doing.<eos> Really?<eos> You're not mad. Even though I totally bolted on you?<eos> Tonight?<eos> Yeah, sure, Alex, I'd love to.<eos> Captain, we need to talk.<eos> Can I call you back?<eos> Agent Chandler alerted you, didn't she? She told you I was coming.
We're gonna go to 1 Police Plaza.<eos> I've got an interview with the deputy commissioner. Then we're gonna go to Chandler's apartment, have another little chat before...<eos> Hold on a sec.<eos> Hi, this is Grace.<eos> Hello? This is Agent Chandler.<eos> I'll meet you back at the truck.<eos> Where are you?<eos> First, I need to know if you meant what you said before, that you protect your sources.<eos> If it warrants it, yes.<eos> Trust me, this warrants it. You're gonna have to come alone, and everything has to be off the record until we really believe that we can trust you.
Cops who are doing good stuff and stopping really, really bad guys...<eos> I'd arrest her.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> I'd arrest her.<eos> Take away her shield, throw her in jail, the works.<eos> Okay, look, you arrest, I prosecute, and a judge and jury decides guilty or innocent.<eos> And it's designed specifically so people don't take the law into their own hands, especially those who carry a badge and a gun.<eos> You know, I-I'm sorry, Tess, but as far as I'm concerned, your friend doesn't deserve to be a cop anymore.<eos> I'm still a little confused about the chronology.<eos> DHS comes to you to help stop an international terrorist...
Uh... He was, um... he was getting nervous.<eos> He was afraid that the rest of DHS would find out about what he was doing.<eos> But why would he get in trouble for wanting to keep looking for terrorists?<eos> That was his job.<eos> He was doing it outside of DHS. He was doing it outside of the law.<eos> Hill believed that there was a major threat out there somewhere, and, for whatever reason, he didn't think that DHS would support him in stopping it.<eos> Okay.<eos> You worked for him, you answered to him.<eos> What was the reason?<eos> Then I can't help you.
You...<eos> You haven't asked me why I'm running.<eos> I don't see it as a mystery.<eos> You've dedicated your whole life to being a public servant.<eos> Your family has been part of the fabric of this place for 50 years.<eos> - Am I missing something?<eos> - There is the issue of my brother Danny.<eos> If you hire me to manage your campaign, my job is to exploit the positives.<eos> End of story. Your name, your record.<eos> I guarantee you. Aguirre would kill to have either one.
Did you share?<eos> No.<eos> This investigation has culminated in the termination of a local trafficking ring, and the seizure of several million dollars' worth of narcotics.<eos> None of this would have been possible without the support and cooperation of Sheriff Frank Aguirre. And the Monroe County Sheriff's Department.<eos> - Sheriff.<eos> - Thank you, Clay.<eos> Thank you. Thank you. I'd also like to add that there are over half a dozen murder cases involving Wayne Lowry that are now officially closed.<eos> We're very proud of what we've accomplished.<eos> Which is why, with great frustration and a heavy heart, I must mention a case that we've yet to solve.<eos> As many of you here know, Detective John Rayburn, one of our finest officers, a colleague, and a friend.
Listen, Danny's dead, Lowry's dead.<eos> I'm thankful that you're safe, but I can't live like this anymore.<eos> So, when I get home from work tomorrow, I want you gone.<eos> I finished waxing.<eos> Cool. Um...<eos> Go ahead and start on Dr. Frank's whaler.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Such are the seats of power.<eos> I can offer you coffee, but don't ask for a cup.
I know I remind you of my dad.<eos> And it sucks.<eos> So, maybe you could give me a break, okay?<eos> Maybe I can come back sometime?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You can come back anytime you wanna come back.<eos> You know, I'd love to see things in action.<eos> Well, Fridays, Saturdays, they're their best nights. They're...<eos> No more excuses.<eos> I didn't expect to hear from you again.
Blossom had a dual German-Canadian citizenship.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I saw her passport when I bailed her out of jail after that DUI.<eos> The second one.<eos> But she always got sick in the car.<eos> Yep, because she was shit-faced.<eos> This girl knew how to light it on fire.<eos> Oh, I'm getting upset.<eos> Fuck you, Blossom!<eos> Maria, my black heart goes out to you.
Fuck you, Blossom!<eos> Maria, my black heart goes out to you.<eos> I mean it.<eos> From one person who has killed dogs before to another, I know it's tough.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> Thank you, Karen.<eos> And I'm sorry that you couldn't make it.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I was just freshening up my drank.<eos> I know you've been dealing with bad news, so I'm gonna hit you with the good stuff.
His dogs aren't, though.<eos> They had a falling out.<eos> It's always about the fucking money.<eos> Speaking of money, when you land in Minneapolis, you're gonna head straight to the annual Checklist Check Down.<eos> And get ready to cream your jeans, because Mark McGrath is gonna be there.<eos> -Oh, God.<eos> -From Sugar Ray.<eos> Cream away.<eos> I'll wait.<eos> Meant to tell you, I... I can't do it. I can't.
These are more like exercise partners.<eos> I'll see how close he is.<eos> Watson?<eos> Hey. Where are you?<eos> Crime scene.<eos> I'm here. I don't see you.<eos> I'm at the second crime scene.<eos> I found your shooters.<eos> As luck would have it, both been murdered.<eos> Officer Walker and I were moments from joining you when news of this crashed blue sedan came over the radio.
They chase "moonshots."<eos> It's the current tech-speak for technologies which, if brought to fruition, could literally change the world.<eos> Or take us to a new one.<eos> Hi.<eos> Phil Balsam.<eos> VP of R D.<eos> Uh, sorry about the video-- it's a little self-congratulatory.<eos> Uh, we're here to see Fiona Helbron, aka Mittens.<eos> Yes, my secretary told me-- she said you were the police.<eos> Would you mind telling me why you want to see Fiona?
The past few months, we were hammering out the details.<eos> When was the last time you met with him? Never.<eos> We did all of our business by e-mail and phone.<eos> I didn't even know he was in New York.<eos> This deal would have been worth billions in gross profits over the next ten years.<eos> Enough to bring our entire robotics division into profit.<eos> And now that he's dead?<eos> The port deal is dead, too.<eos> Take my word-- I am the last person who would have arranged his murder.<eos> Let's say we believe you.
He made me and warned Zolotov.<eos> If Zolotov wasn't your assignment, why did he run?<eos> I think he didn't want his friends in Moscow to hear that he was working on another deal while he was supposed to be on the mission for them.<eos> He was on a mission for the Kremlin?<eos> From what I could gather, he was in the U.S. to conduct some sort of secret, backdoor diplomacy.<eos> I don't know the details, but if that's what got him killed, there will be consequences.<eos> I don't care what Sherlock says.<eos> This food is not just fuel.<eos> Tomorrow, you'll have to tell Sherlock what he missed.<eos> Are you all right? You're barely eating.

You're barely eating.<eos> Oh, I had a late lunch.<eos> This dish reminds me of one I once enjoyed at Le Val Gielgud, one of Mycroft's first restaurants.<eos> I'm quite aware he's alive, Joan.<eos> Also aware that he's under the protection of American intelligence.<eos> Sherlock told you.
Oh, I have my ways.<eos> It's my understanding that you were quite close.<eos> For a little while.<eos> Have you heard from him?<eos> Not for some time, no.<eos> But I understand why it must be.<eos> I respect the choice he made.<eos> I have to admit, I wondered if that's why you came to New York.<eos> He's gone, so you want to mend your relationship with Sherlock.<eos> There was another matter I was hoping to discuss with you.
Just like that?<eos> I might have posed as a wealthy Ukrainian-American businessman interested in helping the cause.<eos> Point of fact is, they confirmed a list I'd already compiled myself. Okay.<eos> Officially, I don't want to know about it.<eos> Unofficially, I'm worried about what happens when the Feds' theory about the Ukrainians gets back to the Russians.<eos> There could be reprisals, more deaths, less peace.<eos> So maybe you can give them a better theory, whether they want to hear it or not?<eos> Watson is, at this very moment, having a chat with someone with a passing familiarity with arms dealers.<eos> Joan?<eos> I didn't expect to hear back from you so quickly.

You know what they say-- war is good for business.<eos> So you don't deny selling weapons to both the Ukrainians and the Russians?<eos> I sold weapons to the Ukrainians, but not the Russians.<eos> Russians make perfectly good ones on their own.<eos> I sold them computer parts and electronics.<eos> For drones and long-range missiles.<eos> I don't know where they end up.<eos> I just know they bought a lot of them.<eos> According to our sources, you used to work for the CIA.<eos> So your contacts in D.C. could've told you about Zolotov's mission.

Why are you wearing that?<eos> We're back to matching.<eos> Well, it was working... until you opened your mouth.<eos> Why do we always have to match you?<eos> I matched you last week at the airport.<eos> For two minutes, and I saw how uncomfortable it made you to take this off.<eos> Well, I feel naked without it.<eos> Well, I feel suffocated with it.<eos> It's like Day 1 all over again.<eos> So, Mr. Baskin, tell us about the most difficult time in your life, a time that made you realize how small and insignificant you were.
- Yeah, I know he is.<eos> I'm just worried he doesn't think he needs to.<eos> But we're getting so close. You know, you should be happy.<eos> Hey. He's one of the few good ones here.<eos> Please don't screw with that, okay?<eos> I'm watching you. I love when you do.<eos> Please welcome back Executive Assistant Director Clayton Haas.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's good to be back.<eos> Well, I came here this morning because I wanted to show you a KH satellite image of a Mexican cartel in Juarez.

The Office of Personnel Management requires each of you to fill out a security clearance form, also know as the SF-86.
How about drinks tonight for old time's sake?<eos> Ryan could handle class. Yeah, you know? Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Those of you still seated have been granted security clearance.<eos> Those still standing have been flagged for further review.<eos> What do you think happened?<eos> How can they split us up?<eos> Do you think they found out?<eos> Will the NATs that have been flagged please exit the classroom so that the cleared NATs can begin the investigation process?<eos> Now, each of you will be investigating one flagged trainee.
So then are you also aware that a car used in the kidnapping of a former FBI agent just yesterday was rented under the same name?<eos> All of it seems pretty suspicious to me, considering he's the son of a vice presidential candidate who will stop at nothing to get elected. So you think my son is a terrorist?<eos> You really have lost your mind, haven't you?<eos> Well, if I'm that crazy, I wonder why this - vice presidential nominee is taking time out of her busy schedule to talk to me.<eos> We all know how much trouble conspiracy theorists like you can cause.<eos> I only care about the truth. Yeah, well, so do I.<eos> And you have no idea how wrong you are.<eos> - Then prove it.<eos> - I plan to.<eos> And when I do, you're gonna be dreadfully sorry.
She's not really my sister.<eos> I only found out a couple months ago.<eos> I know.<eos> And last I heard from OPM, they do, too.<eos> You are cleared.<eos> Now, what is this about Caleb?<eos> What are we doing at your house?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Open it.<eos> Now, are you finished with this evil-mastermind business, or do you need me to show you his track marks, too?
Senator, your car is here.<eos> Amanda, would you please get a car for Alex and have it take her back to New York?<eos> Can I come in?<eos> I need you to listen to me. And I need you to listen closely.<eos> The day you arrived, I knew you were special.<eos> You asked tough questions.<eos> You demanded answers about your father, about what happened in Chicago, about what happened in Omaha.<eos> You fought for the truth.<eos> You don't quit.<eos> I see that in you, and that will take you far.
The terrorist...<eos> We've been calling them the "Voice."<eos> I thought it was someone from our class, but it could be... it could be anyone there.<eos> What are you thinking? About what?<eos> How you lied to a Congressional committee when you said that Elias Harper acted alone?<eos> Or the bomb that was strapped to Agent Vasquez to keep you in line.<eos> Or maybe you want my thoughts on you sneaking Vasquez and that bomb into our office to steal classified Intel from an FBI server.<eos> I mean, I hope there was nothing important on there besides, oh, I don't know, all the security measures for the upcoming presidential election.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> Ah, yes. That convenient recurring line of anyone you say has been forced to work with this terrorist since it all began.
They're blood pressure medicine.<eos> The only side effect is elevated body temperature.<eos> And this terrorist said that if anyone else learned about what was going on, their lives would be in danger, too.<eos> And yet you still told Simon and me.<eos> I can't figure you out, Parrish.<eos> I mean you have no fear in having just admitted to a dozen federal crimes, not to mention if I look closely enough, accessory to murder, and if you're at all to be believed, you've just willingly hung a target on my back to save your own without compunction.<eos> So, if you were me, would you believe a word you just said?<eos> I don't know, Hannah.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, yeah, I believe you.
No, I think it's dangerous and cool.<eos> And I'd love to talk about it for five to seven minutes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The Amin twins.<eos> We've put a pin in that.<eos> They were in direct contact with the terrorists.<eos> We can't discuss either sister publicly until OPR's investigation is over.<eos> OPR...<eos> Office of Professional Responsibility.<eos> They're gonna want statements from you both.
Launch codes, anthrax, tiny explosives.<eos> Yeah, well, he thinks it's a SIM card.<eos> He's still checking.<eos> It's so small that it should be harmless.<eos> Let's just get it under the seat and see who comes to get it.<eos> I wish I felt that any of this was gonna work in our favor, but I'm nervous.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> But that's what makes you such a good agent.<eos> You see everything.<eos> I've been wanting to tell you something for a while and not having you, like, right in my face makes this easier.

We're too far away.<eos> Well, we've got to do something!<eos> Thank you for doing this.<eos> No one else understands.<eos> No retreat, no surrender.<eos> You got a plan?<eos> Follow my lead.<eos> Nobody move.<eos> I need everyone to stay in their seats.<eos> If you want to live, you'll do exactly as I tell you.
It's two against one.<eos> On your knees, counselor.<eos> My name is Special Agent Shelby Wyatt.<eos> This is my partner, Special Agent Alex Parrish.<eos> Everything is okay.<eos> These men are under arrest.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> You have the right to speak to an attorney and to have an attorney present during any questioning.<eos> If you can't afford an attorney, one will be provided to you.
Don't listen to her.<eos> Let go of the trigger.<eos> Think of the families.<eos> Are you a mother?<eos> Think of all the children that are waiting for them to come home.<eos> By the time this plane's on the ground, we'll all be dead.<eos> No, that is not true.<eos> We're gonna save you.<eos> Everyone can live this time.<eos> I promise you.
The whole world thought you were Public Enemy Number One, and you proved them wrong.<eos> I mean, and today, we foiled an assassination.<eos> Claire Haas is still alive, which is how I know that you will find this person and you will stop them.<eos> Because you already are.<eos> Just... do me a favor.<eos> Anything.<eos> No matter what happens, don't bring Ryan into this.<eos> He needs to sit this one out.<eos> I promise.<eos> This is all you now.
Even when it's not perfect, even if it costs you something, even if it costs you everything.<eos> Shelby, that's what you did today.<eos> And that's what I did, too.<eos> It is time for me to say goodbye...<eos> What?<eos> As your teacher.<eos> For now, at least.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I know you and I haven't always seen eye-to-eye, but with Miranda on leave, we are short a counselor.<eos> And you're someone that the NATs already feel comfortable with.
I asked Ms. Haas to be our enrichment speaker this morning because... we are going to discuss one of her cases.<eos> February 3, 2008.<eos> Does anyone remember what happened on that day?<eos> How about you, Perales?<eos> Super Bowl 42.<eos> Giants won 17-14. Spoiled the Pats' perfect season.<eos> And an hour after the game ended, five Giants fans got into a fight with four Patriots fans in the parking lot of a New Haven club.<eos> One of the Patriots fans was killed.<eos> Is this a hate crime?<eos> What if I told you that the Patriots' fans were black, the Giants' fans white?

I need to review some of these charges on your card.<eos> Now, I just want to know, you, by any chance, did not spend $2,000 on...<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Why do I keep finding you near Senator Haas?<eos> Oh, um...<eos> Hannah, I can explain.<eos> Okay, if by "explain," you mean lie again, then no, I'm not gonna do that.<eos> Instead, I'm gonna figure out what you're up to and how it connects to the senator.<eos> 'Cause right now, you're a little too close and a little too crazy for my comfort and the Secret Service's.<eos> I'm warning them about you.
Hannah's blocking me.<eos> If you can't get to Claire, can you get her to come to you?<eos> Time!<eos> Those of you who answer correctly will be moving on to the next phase... building a bias profile against someone very important...<eos> - yourself.<eos> - You first.<eos> You're the most messed up person in the bureau.<eos> You don't deserve our honesty.<eos> Well, that is the assignment, Perales,<eos> - and I don't owe you a thing.
They're terrorists, okay?<eos> I don't condone attacking anyone, but we can't just dismiss why they're doing it.<eos> Who knows what the FBI might have done to create cause?<eos> You see, Perales, this is exactly why you don't belong here.<eos> Mistakes happen. Even here, okay?<eos> But you can't accept that.<eos> You think that everyone should be just as perfect as you think you are.<eos> Says the teacher who sleeps with his students.<eos> Petty in a crisis.<eos> That is a good look on you.
Says the teacher who sleeps with his students.<eos> Petty in a crisis.<eos> That is a good look on you.<eos> Hey, where are you going?<eos> To do my job.<eos> I know Charlie's involved.<eos> I missed the signs.<eos> Again.<eos> No. You didn't miss them.<eos> No one wanted to believe you.
I know Charlie's involved.<eos> I missed the signs.<eos> Again.<eos> No. You didn't miss them.<eos> No one wanted to believe you.<eos> All this is happening because I didn't trust my instincts.<eos> - It's going to be okay.<eos> - No, I...<eos> I... I could have stopped this.<eos> I should have told my mom, you, the feds, anyone.
I'm...<eos> I'm so sorry. I just didn't want to destroy you again.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Get down, get down.<eos> It's HRT.<eos> All right, stay with her.<eos> Stay with her.<eos> Liam!<eos> Liam!<eos> Behind you!
I'm so sorry. I just didn't want to destroy you again.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Get down, get down.<eos> It's HRT.<eos> All right, stay with her.<eos> Stay with her.<eos> Liam!<eos> Liam!<eos> Behind you!<eos> Behind you!
Liam!<eos> Behind you!<eos> Behind you!<eos> HRT took out the remaining shooters, however, uh, CCTV confirms that the front passenger of the van fled after they took out the guard gate.<eos> - Find him.<eos> - We're on it.<eos> I need the sit report on...<eos> Perales.<eos> - How'd you end up out there?<eos> - I followed you.
I need the sit report on...<eos> Perales.<eos> - How'd you end up out there?<eos> - I followed you.<eos> Didn't think it was right for you to be on your own.<eos> Had my personal firearm in my duffel.<eos> I checked it when I came to Quantico.<eos> I figured I should check it out when I was leaving.<eos> Coming out there after me, you showed more instinct in an instant than most agents show in a lifetime.<eos> I owe my life to you.
I'm waiting for her right now.<eos> Yeah, I told you she'd be desperate to know where her son is.<eos> Caleb's been missing for months.<eos> Question now is... how are you gonna replace the pills in her bag?<eos> I'm gonna hope that the possibility of talking to Caleb is more important than keeping track of her purse.<eos> Okay, she's here.<eos> Give me the room.<eos> Senator Haas.<eos> Where is my son, Agent Parrish?<eos> Why don't I let him tell you himself?
A real liberal lion.<eos> He and some other fellows had this rotating poker game.<eos> Now, you would think that these brilliant legal minds would know how to bluff. But I could spot their tells from my apartment.<eos> A nervous knee, a finger twitch.<eos> Handler didn't blink... just like you.<eos> It's true the world doesn't know where my son is, but neither do you.<eos> Only I do.<eos> If you knew I was lying, then why come see me?<eos> After prolonging the investigation into the terrorist attack that killed my husband and forcing me and those nearest to him to relive it over and over again for three months of conspiracy theories and unsubstantiated evidence,<eos> I thought I would enjoy telling you personally that you are finished at the Bureau.
I tried her ex-husband, called her family, No one's heard from her in days.<eos> It's as if she just disappeared.<eos> - That's what I was...<eos> - Okay, so I traced the e-mail that she sent asking for "emergency personal leave."<eos> It didn't come from her computer or her phone.<eos> It was bounced from a remote server... untraceable.<eos> There's no reason why Natalie would do something like that, which means she didn't do it, which means I had to consider t he horrible possibility that you, unstable, out-of-control, paranoid Alex Parrish,<eos> America's least wanted... weren't lying, incorrect, or insane. You were simply telling the truth.<eos> - I just...<eos> - So I swapped the pills, and now before I'm arrested and tried for treason alongside the two of you, will someone please tell me, did I just poison the next Vice President of the United States? - Oh, my God, Hannah.
Liam's in town.<eos> New York City, Washington D.C., Chicago, L.A.<eos> Only the best of the best end up there.<eos> In four short weeks, your training will end and you will be assigned to one of the FBI's 56 field offices.<eos> Think you're a little outmatched.<eos> You're dreaming if you think you're gonna take my spot in New York.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I guess even pros lose their footing once in a while.<eos> Choosing a field office is about more than picking a job.<eos> It's about finding a home, a place many of you will start families.
And while you do get to rank your choices, ultimately the Bureau will do what it believes is best for the Bureau.<eos> I wish I had better news, but things are bad here for Miranda.<eos> Everything she's touched is radioactive, including you two going undercover as twins.<eos> And you're not in trouble, but this experiment of hers may soon be coming to an end.<eos> But this project is important.<eos> How can the FBI just give it up?<eos> It was Miranda's idea, not theirs.<eos> And with Miranda on leave, pending her hearing, there's no one left to push it up the hill. I'm sorry.<eos> You have until week's end to submit your choices.<eos> And then the praying starts, because those of you who end up in towns like Little Rock never get out.
Canada... where you will liaise with immigration, customs, and TSA agents while learning firsthand how these crimes are perpetrated.<eos> Hey. So, I know Shelby wanted to meet her parents face-to-face and they can't set foot in the U.S., but Canada...?<eos> One final announcement.<eos> As you all know, I've been taking on the assistant director's workload in her absence, which means I've been in need of another staff counselor to help me in your final weeks of training.<eos> So, for those of you who don't know him already,<eos> Staff Counselor Ryan Booth.<eos> Good to see you, Booth.<eos> It's good to see you, too.<eos> "Interim Deputy Director."<eos> Suits you.

But most people are still smuggled into the U.S. the old-fashioned way... across physical borders.<eos> Examine this vehicle and see exactly how for yourself.<eos> Report your findings.<eos> Not a bad place for twins to swap in and out of an operation.<eos> If we can keep it going.<eos> Liam is the A.D. now.<eos> Maybe we should ask him if he wants Miranda's leftovers.<eos> Oh, hey. I almost forgot you were here.<eos> Drew Perales.<eos> Heard a ton about you.

I almost forgot you were here.<eos> Drew Perales.<eos> Heard a ton about you.<eos> Special Agent Ryan Booth.<eos> Heard nothing about you.
Now my ass is on the line with the CIA.<eos> And yours is, too.<eos> Caleb, what are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to make sure that you guys are leaving.<eos> And why should we do that?<eos> You came here to con Shelby out of more money.<eos> Our allowance dried up. I-It...<eos> You know that. We need more.<eos> I left Shelby's phone so I could listen in. I heard everything.<eos> You do realize that this will destroy her?
15 years apart, and Shelby's finally reunited with her long-lost parents.<eos> You said it herself... this will destroy her.<eos> Do you really want to be the person to do that?<eos> Shelby's gonna give us the money.<eos> We'll stay in touch with her.<eos> Shelby stays happy.<eos> Everybody wins.<eos> I will transfer $5 million into your account right now under one condition.<eos> This is the last time.<eos> Shelby never sees or hears from either one of you again.
I know your heart, but I don't know you.<eos> I slept with Ryan Booth, the Marine I met on a plane.<eos> I fell for Special Agent Booth, undercover at Quantico.<eos> I said goodbye to Ryan at a party with his lovely ex-wife. And here you are, Staff Counselor Booth, who I'm supposed to have a professional relationship with?<eos> All those people that you met are still me.<eos> And any one of them would have been more than fine.<eos> But all of them together? It's just... too many pieces of too many different puzzles.<eos> I should probably get going, Staff Counselor.<eos> Yeah, Parrish, you probably should.<eos> To the 18 of you who made it across the border last night, your success is not a victory.
If lives are at stake?<eos> You do your duty.<eos> You have to say something.<eos> Without a doubt.<eos> Our duty is to the Bureau before ourselves.<eos> Now, are you gonna tell us who this is?<eos> You know, honestly, I shouldn't have said anything.<eos> It's none of my business.<eos> Three more weeks.<eos> That's all you have left until those doors fly open and we send you out into the real world.
Counteterrorism.<eos> Behavioral science.<eos> There are over 20 different programs within the Bureau.<eos> Choose wisely, and you're in the pocket.<eos> Choose poorly, all of this will have been for nothing.<eos> But how to decide, how to know the role you're most suited for.<eos> Well, we're here to help.<eos> Today is the day you pick your top three choices.<eos> Think of this as Quantico's version of career day.<eos> We've brought in representatives from every major program to talk to you.
I'm Shelby Wyatt. Ah.<eos> They said you'd be stopping by.<eos> I've been covering Sistemics for years.<eos> They recruit extensively online.<eos> You know, I'm glad you feel strongly, but I should warn you, we've never been able to catch them in anything.<eos> And what goes on in there past those introductory assessments, that remains a mystery to us.<eos> How would someone find out?<eos> How big's your checkbook?<eos> Thank you all for picking your top three choices.<eos> And while many of you will be placed in these programs, most of you will not.

It was about them checking you out.<eos> They've read your files. They've met you one-on-one.<eos> Inside each of these envelopes are the names of the programs interested in you.

They faked their death after 9/11 because they were selling weapons to the Taliban.<eos> For 15 years, Shelby's been protecting them, moving illegal money.<eos> She's been keeping secrets, telling lies. When she left the FBI, I thought it was none of my business.<eos> And now she's rushing in here, doing who knows what to our servers.<eos> I mean, think about it.<eos> Hold the upgrade.<eos> Hold it, please.<eos> Miss Wyatt, come with me, please.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Look, Shelby, you and I both know I owe you the benefit of the doubt. You were there for me when I...
I am a son of a bitch.<eos> I told you we can't trust him.<eos> Nimah, what is that?<eos> This is the A.D. Clayton Haas. Please leave a message.<eos> It's Shelby Wyatt.<eos> I don't know if you know this, but your son, he's back with the same group that you pulled him out of when he was 17.<eos> Call me as soon as you get this.<eos> If I don't answer, it's for a reason.<eos> Welcome, friend.<eos> Can I help you?
You think they're gonna bring you in a back room and roll out the blueprints for the buildings they're gonna bomb?<eos> No, they're gonna make you work in the kitchen, in the bedroom.<eos> What is Liam doing here?<eos> I texted him.<eos> About what we found?<eos> Nimah, he's our handler.<eos> We should give him the chance to explain himself.<eos> Wow. Did you really think that you just stumbled upon this money and these drugs?<eos> Freed's testing you.<eos> If you don't trust him, he can't run you.
Drew, please.<eos> No.<eos> Well, you're right.<eos> Caleb was working undercover for Sistemics at first.<eos> But not under any orders from me.<eos> He thought he could take them on himself.<eos> I guess he thought he was strong enough to fight his worst enemy, and they ended up being much stronger.<eos> He got sucked back in, as you suspected.<eos> I did tell O'Connor and Will Olsen not to say anything.<eos> That wasn't fair to you or to them.

What is it?<eos> Hey, there, little, uh... little gremlin guy.<eos> How'd you get in here?<eos> You've lost a lot of blood.<eos> Well, then why are you taking more?<eos> - Typing and crossing.<eos> - All right. You may need a transfusion.<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - Hey, she's just trying to help.<eos> I will save you the trouble.
The friendly skies haven't been so friendly to us.<eos> Hey, don't worry.<eos> Apparently, according to Eleanor, this plane has been equipped with some sort of countermeasures.<eos> So, they're going to try and squeeze us into a fighter jet.<eos> Looks like the skies just got a whole lot friendlier.<eos> This is your pilot, Greg Trotter.<eos> Greg, this is Jackson Oz...<eos> - Hey. - Welcome.<eos> - Abraham Kenyatta...<eos> - Hi, how are you?
Be in the air in no time.<eos> Enjoy your tour.<eos> The sleeping quarters and the lounge are upstairs.<eos> You'll have to decide amongst yourselves who gets the master bedroom.<eos> This kitchen is bigger than my first apartment.<eos> Vehicle bay is in the tail and this is the lab.<eos> Eleanor... whose plane is this?<eos> An interested third party who has a lot to lose if the Noah Objective goes forward.<eos> And this third party is giving us a ride to meet a scientist?<eos> Not giving you a ride, giving you a plane.
Hang on a second.<eos> Reiden Global?<eos> The biotech company that started this whole animal mess... they still have a say in this?<eos> They offered a solution, and people are listening.<eos> The Noah Objective is not a solution.<eos> - It's murder.<eos> - We're part of a dwindling few who believe that.<eos> The only way we're gonna convince the others is by giving them a viable alternative.<eos> Start in Argentina.<eos> Meet with Dr. Vickers, see if his work... if this animal he's hunting can help you.
I need to be there. Yeah, I understand.<eos> Completely.<eos> But if you want what is best for your daughter, for your sons, your wives, we need to stay here.<eos> If we don't succeed here, you don't have families to go back to.<eos> Everything will be gone.<eos> Life as we know it will change. I am talking about the extinction of the human race.<eos> But we can stop it.<eos> Our work here will make it so our children have a future.<eos> They will be able to... ride bikes and play baseball, hold our hands when we cross the street.<eos> Look, we may not be home, but I assure you, we are on the front lines of their future.
Yeah, mutation made them better, stronger, right?<eos> Him... it's like he's... turning into the perfect predator.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> And do you have any update - on the compound?<eos> - Not yet, but I expect to send a team to look for Jamie soon.<eos> We're just stretched so thin right now.<eos> I-I was lucky to be able to task the rangers to accompany Dr. Vickers.<eos> Have you located him?<eos> The Phase Two animal he was chasing killed him and the rangers, too.<eos> Were you able to secure the animal?
Lieutenant Marzan, you'll take Jackson and Abe to Ydermo.<eos> Is that an order?<eos> 'Cause I don't see stripes on your sleeve.<eos> I don't need stripes.<eos> I have a plane. The quicker we get what we need, the quicker you get back to Sao Paolo.<eos> We're in the valley.<eos> Shouldn't the fauna be more lush?<eos> We humped through here on foot.<eos> It's all like this.<eos> So what's up between you and the scientist?
We buried them along with the rest of her squad.<eos> Who the hell is this!<eos> I'm heading back to the hostel.<eos> Look, we have to find the elephant that bit Kovacs.<eos> Stop calling him that!<eos> That thing is not Kovacs.<eos> I knew Kovacs. He's long gone.<eos> But this...?<eos> If one of my guys is alive, the last thing I'm doing is chasing down some elephant.<eos> Look, I was there with you.
Cat's office? How are you even gonna get near that place without being seen?<eos> Look, that's the last place DHS is gonna be looking for me, all right?<eos> No one's gonna see me.<eos> Be there, 1:00 sharp.<eos> Okay.<eos> What?<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Call you back. Agent Chandler. Please, sit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Um... my husband doesn't trust you.
I love my husband, Agent Morgan, but I know that he needs help, I know that now.<eos> He shouldn't have run, he should have trusted me.<eos> I would've told him to trust that the truth would come out, but now he just looks guilty.<eos> Look, I know Vincent, and he will not give up without a fight.<eos> That's why I came back.<eos> I don't want to be a widow.<eos> Okay.<eos> I want to find proof that Secretary Hill really did set him up.<eos> I know that's not what you think happened, but Vincent does.<eos> And if he at least thinks that you're trying to find proof, then maybe he will trust you enough to let you bring him in.
It will be if you don't tell me why.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I think you know who I am.<eos> Secretary Hill hired you, uh, twice to take me out, if I remember correctly.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Sure you do.<eos> It's your business to know things.<eos> Including the fact that Hill is now a dead man.<eos> Thanks to you.
So now you're here for what?<eos> Justice?<eos> Revenge?<eos> Oh, no, sir.<eos> I got my revenge on Hill.<eos> I'm just here to make sure that since he's no longer around to pay you, I'm no longer a target.<eos> Not to us, maybe.<eos> But to DHS, you're still a target.<eos> Like you said, my business to know things.<eos> But what I don't know is why Hill was interested in you in the first place.
So right now, I need a place to stay.<eos> And you think what, that I'm running a shelter here for fugitives?<eos> This is a business.<eos> Yeah, and I can be an asset.<eos> I will earn my keep.<eos> If Kane is one of your best, just imagine what I can do.<eos> I know you checked out my credentials.<eos> Special Forces, a checkered past, and now thoroughly disillusioned with the very government that turned you into a killing machine.<eos> You have the right skill set for us, Keller.<eos> So what's the problem? I don't trust you.
No, that isn't what this about Max, really, trust me.<eos> I just...<eos> I need to make sure that my sister's taken care of.<eos> Taken care of?<eos> Cat, is everything all right?<eos> Everything is fine. It is.<eos> I can't really talk about it, but thank you for everything, truly.<eos> Sure.<eos> Take care.<eos> You, too.
Take care.<eos> You, too.<eos> How much cash we talking about?<eos> I mean, four-wheel drives don't resell great in Jersey, man.<eos> Caddies, Lincolns, okay, but...<eos> Come on, it's in good condition. Low mileage.<eos> You know, blue book says it's worth 25.<eos> Yeah, well, people who come here don't do blue book.<eos> They just do cash.<eos> All right, I'll tell you what... I'll give you 15 grand.
And all we know is that Braxton is behind it and he's trying to cover his tracks.<eos> And right now the last track he's gonna cover is your boss.<eos> Garrus and Ecklund are already dead, which means the prince is next.<eos> And believe it or not, we're trying to save him, but we won't do it unless he helps us first. Helps you how?<eos> We know he provided the people for Braxton's experiments.<eos> We want names so that we can have leverage on him.<eos> And so DHS can clear my name for all the things that Braxton's done.<eos> The prince has diplomatic immunity.<eos> It's not gonna matter if your prince is dead, is it?<eos> And it's not gonna help you much, either, if more people die in that attack.
I've kind of gotten used to putting everything else in my life on hold.<eos> Well, after tomorrow, we won't have to worry about it, will we now? Hey.<eos> Rooftop, tonight.<eos> One last time.<eos> One last time. Okay.<eos> Don't be late.<eos> Look, I'm trying to figure out where the attack's gonna be, too, okay? Okay.<eos> But what does a Saudi prince have to do with it?<eos> And what makes you think it's even connected?<eos> Look, I-I can't tell you that.
You're...<eos> You're one of them.<eos> Yes, I'm one of them.<eos> - Braxton sent you, didn't he?<eos> - Actually, we're here to save you from Braxton, who's trying to kill you, along with other innocent people. - What?<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> You're going testify against Braxton, you're gonna prove that he's the one that killed the innocent people that you provided, you got it?<eos> You help us bury him, and I will help save your life.<eos> How-how do I know you're telling the truth?<eos> Would we go through all this if it wasn't true? You think we want to die with you?
Um... -Diane, take the yes.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Sextina Aquafina, you are now the face of the pro-choice movement.<eos> -Now let's get you informed. -Hey!<eos> Uh, what?<eos> [crowd chattering]<eos> So, before the procedure, you'll need to look at an ultrasound and listen to the heartbeat.<eos> Or heartbeats, if you're having a litter.<eos> Why does she have to listen to the heartbeat?<eos> It's the law. Also, by law, I have to tell you that at one month, your puppies have a favorite color and that color may be blue.

I'd honk, too.<eos> So-so we shouldn't be careful trying to find the right spot?<eos> You know what the point of this is? - No, the point of it is, if you think you can do better, why don't you...?<eos> - and get the fuck out of here! - I will tell you what...<eos> - Fuck.<eos> You distracted me!<eos> - Me?<eos> - You distracted me.<eos> - Watch the road, dude. - I was watching the road!<eos> Are you okay?
Take the $123, turn around, get back in your fucking shitty car, and get the fuck out of here right now.<eos> Or what?<eos> You'll shoot me dead in the street?<eos> -No, you don't, you do not want to know.<eos> Oh, you will, you'll shoot me, huh?<eos> - The Yankee says he's going to shoot me!<eos> - No! No! No!<eos> - Nobody's gonna shoot anybody!<eos> - What the fuck are you doing? I said I was gonna shoot her.<eos> How about you just give me your name and address? I will give you double whatever it costs to fix this car.

I will give you double whatever it costs to fix this car.<eos> Look, we'll take care of this right now.<eos> Why should I trust you to do the right thing after you leave Belize?
You realize Belize can be a very dangerous place.<eos> Oh, yeah, yes, but, you know, we're just on vacation. And so far, this place is pretty fantastic.<eos> What if I told you I will put you in an airplane back to the United States tonight? And you will never have to worry about anything here again.<eos> Just you.<eos> Just me?<eos> I can tell you're innocent of anything.<eos> I want to send you home.<eos> You have two daughters, yes?<eos> How do you know about my daughters?<eos> And they are special to you?
- You let the cops in! - What the fuck! I had no choice.<eos> Gus was about to give us up. Go!<eos> Stop them!<eos> Stop!<eos> Come on!<eos> Hey, hey, look. Maybe we should just talk out here.<eos> Okay.<eos> What would you like to say?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hello. - How are you?
It seems the guys have gotten up.<eos> To make cocktails or something.<eos> Great.<eos> Let's have a drink.<eos> You're not in bed.<eos> And no cocktails.<eos> Uh, she wanted to, uh, ask some more questions about the, um, uh, the missing boat.<eos> Hey, didn't know we had company.<eos> I will like, if you don't mind, to interview you one by one.<eos> Which one of you will talk first?
Uh, she wanted to, uh, ask some more questions about the, um, uh, the missing boat.<eos> Hey, didn't know we had company.<eos> I will like, if you don't mind, to interview you one by one.<eos> Which one of you will talk first?<eos> Your name and address, please.<eos> What do you do for work?<eos> Uh, I-I-I teach.<eos> I-I used to be a teacher. Now, I mainly...<eos> I teach teachers... teaching.<eos> Do you enjoy it?
Yes, buying and selling property.<eos> - That is all he does.<eos> - No.<eos> Milo has his fingers in a lot of pies.<eos> Which pies?<eos> Hmm, investments, stock speculations.<eos> Uh, he and I both, uh, play the markets a little.<eos> Stock market? No.<eos> No, just, uh, real estate.<eos> Which of you would you say is... is closest to Milo?
There was this-this cat.<eos> How the hell am I going to explain this shit?<eos> Wait a second, wait a second.<eos> She's just gone to... to look for a car rented in our names.<eos> My name.<eos> With millions of euros of drug money sitting in the trunk.<eos> Do you realize we have less than four hours to return the boat?<eos> Hey, I-I don't-I don't know if you remember me...<eos> You don't think I remember you?<eos> Yeah, I-I rented a car from you earlier.
Why are we stopping?<eos> Where's he going?<eos> Two minutes.<eos> I'm not here to cause any distress or trouble, but I think it's important you hear what I have to say.<eos> What the fuck is he doing?<eos> Oh, I think he's putting the squeeze on fender bender woman.<eos> I know you're not stupid.<eos> You know what that cash is about.<eos> I'm not here to pretend that it's something else, but my concern is with that cash comes a whole lot of trouble.<eos> This concern, it's for you or for me?
So-so come out with your hands up.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Man, give me this.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm giving you three seconds to come out of there or I am going to light this motherfucking closet up, you hear me?<eos> Three, two...<eos> One!<eos> Do it, do it.<eos> I can't. I can't.<eos> Hey, buddy, look, we don't want to hurt you. - I do! - I'm going to fuck you up!
- I have a vest! - What?<eos> What do you want?<eos> - Don't shoot me, please!<eos> - Okay, okay, okay.<eos> - All right. Okay, okay, okay, okay.<eos> All right, get up. We won't hurt you.<eos> - Slow.<eos> - Got your bag, Gus. Sorry, sorry, sorry.<eos> It's okay. It's okay. We won't hurt you!<eos> We're not gonna hurt you.
How long till the embassy opens?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe we should clean up first.<eos> He's got a van.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey!<eos> - Hey, ho!<eos> - Hey, we need a ride!<eos> - Stop, please!<eos> You stupid, arrogant men!<eos> I gave you every chance to tell me the truth, but instead lies, some more lies.
- Right.<eos> Right. We've surmised that The Cat was also connected to Jesús.<eos> I-I didn't surmise that.<eos> - We're not safe here?<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you have the money?<eos> I need you to show me.<eos> Okay... okay.<eos> There's a dead police captain in our pool.<eos> I'll follow you.
- It's not there.<eos> - Well, where is it?<eos> Just give her the gun so we can get the fuck out of here.<eos> She's not moving.<eos> Well, what is she doing?<eos> We said we were going to tell the embassy everything.<eos> Yeah, full cooperation.<eos> "Joel shot her."<eos> You did.<eos> I believe you.

Yeah, I was in bands for most of my life, so I'm...<eos> I'm used to late nights.<eos> Up all night, I would only sleep a few hours in a day.<eos> So you were into rock, then.<eos> You were, like, a rock guy or...<eos> Mm-hmm, rock guy.<eos> I've always wondered what that kind of life is like.<eos> Especially when I was younger, you know, like it's time to rebel or...<eos> I don't know, I've always been kind of straight and narrow, I guess.<eos> In case you couldn't tell.
That you're ambitious and that's a good thing.<eos> Rochelle, they're just jealous 'cause you're gonna actually do something with your life.<eos> Listen, I have done a lot more with my life than you, okay?<eos> And I've done it with a hell of a lot more opposition than you.<eos> Yeah, play the race card, win the argument.<eos> Who said anything...<eos> look, first of all, race is not a card. It's an experience.<eos> Okay, now that we've got that clear, do you have any idea how much overcompensating I have to do to make people like Rochelle feel comfortable?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What, you don't think women spend their lives making men feel comfortable?
Anonymous. No records, just data.<eos> Andre, the father of the twins that came in with us... Mm-hmm?<eos> He sneezed on me.<eos> Is he sick?<eos> He sneezed on just you or also your friends?<eos> Just me, I think.<eos> I'll tell the doctor.<eos> Well, can I tell the doctor?<eos> I mean, when do I get to see an actual doctor?<eos> - If you have smallpox... - Uh-huh.
He sneezed on just you or also your friends?<eos> Just me, I think.<eos> I'll tell the doctor.<eos> Well, can I tell the doctor?<eos> I mean, when do I get to see an actual doctor?<eos> - If you have smallpox... - Uh-huh.<eos> Then you see a doctor.<eos> So you really don't want to see her. - Sir?<eos> - No.<eos> - I am cooperating with you. - Sir?
Uh, he... our friend's gone.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Well, he's just gone.<eos> Uh, he went to Guatemala.<eos> Do you have a contact number for him?<eos> - Sure. - How did you get to the boat we found you on?<eos> We hitchhiked from Belize City.<eos> Hitchhiked?<eos> No, that's not correct.<eos> I don't care what happens. I gotta tell you the truth.
So chill the fuck out!<eos> I went out and gave water to a woman that was coughing.<eos> You will be charged for this door.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, is there any chance that he could have been contaminated? No.<eos> She has TB.<eos> - Oh, great.<eos> - Very nice.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> - Thank you. Well, you guys are okay.
The guy's a depressive.<eos> He's been through something very traumatic. He's alone.<eos> I'm worried what he might do to himself.<eos> Or what Jesús might do to him.<eos> This is Dr. Levine.<eos> Could we, please?<eos> I know that this is very difficult news to tell you, but here's some results.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We have a great team of doctors that can help you.
Any idea how long until my friends are released?<eos> There's no way of knowing.<eos> Minutes?<eos> Hours? Days?<eos> Um, is there a hotel or a hostel nearby?<eos> Barranco.<eos> It is far.<eos> Well, uh, can you give me the number of a taxi?<eos> No taxi here.<eos> I can give you a map. Well, how far is it?
But we don't grow anything in it, just flowers.<eos> Must you spend a lot of money to buy food to cook.<eos> Um... we usually order, um, takeout.<eos> It's, like, you know, we... we order in.<eos> We call, they deliver the food.<eos> Oh, your wife no cook for you?<eos> Not very often.<eos> Well... well, she does, um, make this, like, pasta bake, occasionally.<eos> It's really good, but... it's nothing like this.<eos> I will teach you something to show your wife to cook for you and your family.
I manage people's money.<eos> I take people's money, and then I try to make them more money.<eos> And then in exchange, my firm gets to keep some of that money, and then I get to keep some of that money.<eos> You like this job?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I need the money.<eos> To pay for all the food to be delivered. Yeah.<eos> And other things.<eos> Which one you prefer? - What?
All right, we are definitely the gringos around here, so let's, uh, let's just find somewhere quiet to chill until we figure out what the hell we're doing.<eos> He took the bag!<eos> Hey!<eos> Lex! Lex!<eos> Pharmacy.<eos> Hey, Erica.<eos> It's Gus. - You back in Chicago?<eos> - No. Are you still in Belize?<eos> I-I believe so.<eos> How are you? Are you okay?
30,625 euros, not including the .25 percent handling fee.<eos> Great.<eos> - Two hours.<eos> - An hour and a half.<eos> Fine, two hours.<eos> Call me at the same number when you know it's ready.<eos> You think Erica's really gonna show up?<eos> Before Milo threw it off the boat, did you see what was in the package?<eos> No.<eos> Did he tell you what was in it?
Fuck them both.<eos> You want to die, is that it?<eos> You say it like I have a choice.<eos> They take half the money, they leave us. You don't know that.<eos> I mean, they could be trying to call us right now.<eos> There's no phone service here...<eos> No, I do know that.<eos> I do know... I've had a really, really shitty week.<eos> And I literally don't have the energy to be scared, so...<eos> What did you think of the ice cream?
What did you think of the ice cream?<eos> Rose hip, roses from the garden.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm trying to eat local.<eos> You didn't have to call your friends, you know.<eos> You could've chosen not to.<eos> Whether they come or not, you'll either kill me or you won't.<eos> Then you'll go after them or you won't.<eos> I can't control any of it.<eos> You must be curious, though. Whether they care enough to come for you.
Maybe it's Guatemalan.<eos> Can't change that, man.<eos> Too big.<eos> You can keep the whole thing.<eos> We just want some rice and beans and, you know, whatever else.<eos> There's no banks around here, so we can't...<eos> We're just really hungry.<eos> Hey, you know...<eos> Me brother, him just arrived from Belize city.<eos> Yeah, he can give to you Belizean.
Hey, you know...<eos> Me brother, him just arrived from Belize city.<eos> Yeah, he can give to you Belizean.<eos> Yeah, then take your bill back up to B.C., make for you change.<eos> Hey, no problem, man.<eos> Okay, well, I have someone who's... who's coming to pick us up.<eos> And, uh, she's definitely gonna have cash.<eos> She's from here, but if not, I'll make change with him.<eos> You'll get your money either way.<eos> - Sit down, man. I'll bring it to you.
He was okay with that?<eos> He saw it for what it was, an opportunity.<eos> Before I left Lebanon, the U.S. started something they called the pro-dairy intervention.<eos> They burned the hashish fields and provided local farmers with cows.<eos> Pennsylvania milking cows.<eos> So I was left with a choice.<eos> Find new suppliers, diversify, take on more risk or export cheese.<eos> Is that supposed to impress me?<eos> Well, maybe it fucking should.<eos> Because at the end of the day, that's the difference between you and me and for that matter, between you and Milo.
The woman from the embassy, the southern coast road, uh, there's a-a ruined house near the Guatemalan border, about one mile past the San Pedro turnoff.<eos> Uh, she... she fell.<eos> Well, the transfer has been executed.<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> Great work.<eos> But now I need it transferred back to me now.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, Mr. Franklin, as a professional accountant...<eos> Financial consultant, wealth management.<eos> So you understand that this will also require time and that we will have to charge you the standard
Yeah, lucky me.<eos> - Oh, so you believe in luck.<eos> - Luck is chance.<eos> Chance is math.<eos> I believe in math.<eos> Don't tell me you're a maths teacher.<eos> I teach teachers.<eos> I teach teaching methods.<eos> Christ.<eos> What did Milo see in you?
Oh, great.<eos> What kind of sign language is that?<eos> One of our own devising.<eos> All my employees speak it.<eos> So, uh, that private... private sign language thing, it's, like... it's, like, for secrecy, right?<eos> You ran your own business, correct?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, I'm sensing that you and I are on a similar wavelength, but from your friends I'm sensing dissonance.<eos> Well, I know.<eos> You'd probably be the same if you had the vacation we just had.
- Shut up!<eos> You guys are missing the point. This is good.<eos> It's good to know the weaknesses of your team up front.<eos> That's why I conducted this test with a dummy package.<eos> Now, Gus, you clearly have some trust issues. Problems with authority, huh?<eos> Cobi, you need to be way more assertive, my man.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And, Lex, if I might, just a bit too trusting.<eos> And, Joel...<eos> You got some anger in there.
Then I came back to help out.<eos> What did you do in Guatemala?<eos> I went to the embassy. I was trying to get your passports back.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> Went for a walk.<eos> Played soccer with some Argentineans.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's get back and get this thing over with.<eos> I'm entrusting this with you.
Well, he crossed a minefield to save you.<eos> Your granny stole half our money.<eos> She's why you're here.<eos> - Okay... - The last time you came looking for me, you said it wasn't your money.<eos> Okay, okay!<eos> Guys, okay, listen.<eos> I'm opening the gate.<eos> It's still not our money.<eos> Okay, we're not the bad guys here.<eos> We are here to help you!
Aaron sent us.<eos> Big conehead motherfucker with the fucking biker tights.<eos> I know Aaron.<eos> You know that fucker took a boat, Jesus's boat, in the middle of a fucking drop, man, in the middle of the day.<eos> That took some serious balls, man.<eos> That's a giant motherfucking move!<eos> Except it wasn't, 'cause you bozos stole the damn boat.<eos> Yeah, but we did return the package and-and...<eos> - and the money, right?<eos> - Yeah. If-if this is about the boat, we can show you where it is.
Look at me.<eos> I turned out okay.<eos> So where is Mr. Big Bro, Big Guy?<eos> - He's inside.<eos> - With Jesus.<eos> Oh, that's too bad. But, listen, I want to apologize for spilling the drink;<eos> That was an accident.<eos> - No hard feelings, okay?<eos> - No hard feelings.<eos> What... what if... what if I can help you?
All right, get up.<eos> Slowly, slowly.<eos> So she said yes to our invitation?<eos> If she declined, you'd be dead.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm just calling it like it is.<eos> Did she say anything to you?<eos> She wanted me to... give this-this to Aaron.<eos> Holy...<eos> Fuck.<eos> Do you understand what you did up there?
It has been brought to my attention that not everyone who works here is trustworthy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, I've been pretty patient with you, but honestly, you're starting to rag on me.<eos> I need you to answer some questions, so let's just stop tippy-tapping around, okay, fella?<eos> What happened to this woman?<eos> My friends are outside.<eos> Can I see them, please?<eos> Your friends left, sir.<eos> Try and rest.<eos> I'll be back to check on you in a while.
There are witnesses to you leaving the embassy with her.<eos> You have security footage?<eos> You don't, right?<eos> So once again, it's just someone's word.<eos> Someone pointing the finger at me.<eos> Okay, I'm interpreting this as a lack of cooperation.<eos> My lack of Coop...<eos> My lack of cooperation is because you haven't afforded me legal representation.<eos> Holy crab apple.<eos> You haven't been offered a lawyer because you haven't been charged.
Know what's crazy?<eos> My entire adult life, I've been taking this kind of shit for what other people have done.<eos> Why are you even investigating me?<eos> For the last week, I have literally been running for my life.<eos> I've been threatened, I've been chased. I've been attacked, I've been blown up!<eos> And somehow I end up being the one investigated.<eos> Serious crimes have gone down here.<eos> Crimes against me!<eos> And now you want me to cooperate with you.<eos> While I'm sitting here looking at you, knowing that you're looking at me as if I'm the fucking criminal.
I had no fucking choice.<eos> She would have killed all of us.<eos> You made a pact up there.<eos> Now, for this to work, she has to be the only game in town.<eos> That was her counteroffer.<eos> And you have to kill them?<eos> With your plausible accountability.<eos> Now, go over there.<eos> Be 100% sure that it's them, because right now we are firmly in the "no more fucking mistakes" zone.<eos> And if it is them, I want you to put both hands on the table and strike up a conversation.
Settle?<eos> Don't leave him. Why?<eos> He... just-just... just give him another chance.<eos> You know?<eos> He loves you.<eos> If you are able to tell us who murdered her and we are able to secure a Case on the strength of your information, then I see no reason why we cannot release you.<eos> Joel Kransey.<eos> You know where he might be?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.<eos> Would you like her to read your statement back?
But I've never been more honest in my life and I could care less how that reflects on me.<eos> Well, if what you're saying about this CIA operative and the trafficking is true, this is gonna have to go higher.<eos> I understand.<eos> Gus Givens, I am arresting you for leaving the scene of a crime, knowingly handling drug money, the theft of a boat, involuntary manslaughter, willful endangerment, obstructing the FBI and the non-return of a rental car.<eos> See?<eos> I told you you'd arrest me.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Ow.<eos> The bus... the bus stops further way up the road.<eos> - I-I take you there.
There are things you can do for me.<eos> You know there are.<eos> You just don't see a reason to do them now because I'm all risk and no reward, and that's not how you guys operate, is it?<eos> You're in the equation business.<eos> What do I gain? What do I lose?<eos> Who do I need? And who's expendable?<eos> You think you already have all you need from me.<eos> You don't.<eos> I get it, I see it. Very clearly.<eos> So now I'm gonna tell you... what I can do for you.

We are booked on a 5:00 P.M. flight.<eos> Just get to the airport.<eos> Everything's waiting for you at the desk.<eos> Ticket, passport.<eos> I'll explain when you get here.<eos> We are going home.<eos> Oh, it... broke.<eos> We've printed your travel details, and the wire is still going through.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Have you enjoyed Belize?
I've seen some beautiful and amazing things, too.<eos> C-Certainly things that I'm never gonna forget, but I got to get back to Chicago.<eos> To your children? Yeah.<eos> To whom I will always be an embarrassment and a disappointment.<eos> Despite what I'd like to believe, that is the truth.<eos> Well, you're their father.<eos> It's your job.<eos> Can you explain to me how a shitty guy gets such a beautiful job?<eos> You may be a bullshitter, but you're not a shitty guy.<eos> That's why I came to help you.

Vincent's working undercover for Homeland Security.<eos> Thank you for telling me the truth.<eos> Someone's willing to pay $5 million to capture a beast.<eos> There's a bounty?<eos> Graydal Securities is the one behind the beast bounty, so that's where I'm going next.<eos> Graydal is not just your everyday security firm.<eos> They're like Blackwater on steroids.<eos> Pretty ballsy move, you walking in here that way.<eos> So what's the problem?<eos> I don't trust you.
So more tests?<eos> Don't know.<eos> But you'll find out soon enough.<eos> Like I said, you're free to go.<eos> Except for DHS, of course, but that's your problem, not mine.<eos> What makes you think I'm not just going to kill you, right here, right now?<eos> Because that won't get you the answers you're looking for.<eos> And because I don't think you want to be dealing with another murder charge, either.<eos> The buyer will be contacting you.<eos> He'll let you know what the next test is.
Well, it matters to me.<eos> Now I think my boyfriend is suspicious again.<eos> You Keller?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who wants to know?<eos> From what I hear, quite a few people do.<eos> Especially DHS.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nice to have friends in high places.<eos> I wouldn't know. First you're gonna tell me who it is and what the hell this is about, 'cause I really, really don't like helping guys like you out.
You Keller?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who wants to know?<eos> From what I hear, quite a few people do.<eos> Especially DHS.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nice to have friends in high places.<eos> I wouldn't know. First you're gonna tell me who it is and what the hell this is about, 'cause I really, really don't like helping guys like you out.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Okay then. By the way, I was told to give you this.
Thanks again.<eos> It's my favorite gun.<eos> Captain Vargas?<eos> Agent Olivia Dylan, DHS.<eos> You got a minute? Sure.<eos> I was hoping you could help me with a case I'm working on.<eos> All right.<eos> What case?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You don't really expect me to believe that your best friend, your old partner, hasn't told you what's going on with her husband?
As a cop.<eos> You know that I'm telling you the truth.<eos> You've seen the other people that we've been up against in the past.<eos> As a cop, you should want to do everything in your power to stop whoever it is we're up against this time.<eos> Besides, you know, I'm-I'm just a little fish.<eos> All right.<eos> You have 48 hours, and that is it.<eos> You better come back with a big fish and new evidence on Erik Lee.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> Can I help you?
Well, JT can help you with that.<eos> Forget JT.<eos> And, you, forget about people whispering, there's nothing you can do about that anyway.<eos> You need to focus, because the sooner you can get back on the inside with DHS, the sooner you can figure out how to exonerate Vincent and get out of this mess.<eos> And get your happily ever after back. Yeah, what does that mean? I don't even know what that means.<eos> Well, I don't know, don't look at me, you're the one who keeps saying it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well... forget a happily ever after,<eos> I will just be happy to have Vincent back alive.<eos> What do I have to do to prove to you that you can trust me, huh?
You should never have been anywhere near that sting when we lost Keller.<eos> All due respect, Agent Dylan, but you weren't there.<eos> I tried to help reason with Vincent.<eos> I tried to bring him in. That wasn't the time to reason.<eos> It was the time to take action. You were too emotional. You weren't fit to negotiate Keller's surrender.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> I didn't say or do enough to bring him in.<eos> I wasn't ready.<eos> But I am now. Is that why you're still wearing your wedding ring?<eos> I'm not gonna try to convince you that I don't still care about him, because I do.
Uh, say hi to Tess for me.<eos> Hope her date bombs.<eos> Keller.<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> I was trying to reach you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Why is that? Didn't answer my question.<eos> I was ducking drones.<eos> Right answer. Homeland Security's more pissed with you than I realized.<eos> Makes me trust you a little more.
Keller did help me escape, so he can't be a DHS plant.<eos> But he kisses like a married man.<eos> Then you need to figure out if we can trust him one way or another.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Like I've been hit by a truck.<eos> I heard you saved my life.<eos> It was the least I could do.<eos> It's not your fault, Chandler. It's your husband's.<eos> You're not responsible for his actions.<eos> I guess it's time I really started trusting you though.
Come on, go. Come on.<eos> Hurry.<eos> One more time.<eos> Come on, damn it.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's all right. I'm here, I'm here.<eos> Just breathe.<eos> Just breathe.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> I'm gonna help you. Just breathe.
I don't care if your husband's innocent or not.<eos> I only care about bringing him in, do you understand?<eos> I understand, and I would have if that Interpol assassin hadn't gotten in my way.<eos> He must have just slipped out. Yeah, I know.<eos> Seeing as how you seem to have a knack for tracking him down,<eos> I'm gonna make you the point person on the investigation. You okay with that?<eos> Um... uh, yes.<eos> Yeah, of course, thank you.<eos> I won't let you down.<eos> Well, you better not, or I'll take you down along with your husband.
And think of our group's name:<eos> Stop Teasing And Bullying. STAB. STAB!<eos> STAB!<eos> STAB!<eos> STAB! STAB!<eos> STAB! STAB!<eos> STAB!<eos> STAB! STAB!<eos> STAB!<eos> Ms. Snap, I drew you another picture.
- Oh, Hot Dad.<eos> What?<eos> Yes?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> Are you Blake's dad?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You wanted to meet with me?<eos> Yes, thank you for coming in.<eos> Um, I wanted to talk with you about some issues concerning Blake's behavior.
STAB! STAB! STAB!<eos> STAB! STAB!<eos> STAB! STAB!<eos> STAB!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Stop.<eos> STAB is too big for you to control.
Today, we're gonna work to turn all of you bullies into buddies.<eos> What a nightmare.<eos> Now, who here has a personal story they'd like to share about a time they were bullied?<eos> This is for the students.<eos> Yes.<eos> Ms. Snap hates my drawings.<eos> What?<eos> That's not true.<eos> They're just not an accurate portrayal of my body.<eos> I drew you a new one.
Reid: Previously on "Criminal Minds"...<eos> You're part of an interconnected group of hitmen working together online.<eos> How many of them are you?
Was that what I think it was?<eos> Everybody hold.<eos> Why are we here, Spencer?<eos> We're here because you belong to a network of 4 hitmen who've been operating in the shadows of the Internet.<eos> You're know as Miss .45.<eos> My team and I have been hunting for months, and I knew that if I boxed you in, I could arrest you with as little resistance as possible.<eos> Your team being the behavioral analysis unit of the FBI?<eos> You guys are good.<eos> You're the only ones that got close to us.<eos> But we got kind of close to you, too, didn't we?
Ok, let's talk, but let's talk about something interesting, at least.<eos> Tell me about me.<eos> You?<eos> You're a black widow hitwoman.<eos> You specialize in seduction and you're patient.<eos> You learn everything you can about the men you're hired to kill, physically, psychologically, and emotionally, because you want them in as compromised a position as possible so they don't see it coming when you pull the trigger.<eos> And when I do it really well, they pull the trigger themselves.<eos> Give me your phone. Why?<eos> Because I know what I want now.<eos> I want to play a game with you.
It's certainly cocky.<eos> Yeah, it's smart, but it's risky.<eos> He's taking security flaws from his own code and then exploiting them as another level of security.<eos> If I didn't know any better, I'd think he was having fun.<eos> He wouldn't do this if his life depended on it, unless...<eos> He's young.<eos> Yeah, and based on this, like high school young.<eos> Garcia used it to find the website that Snowman set up for all of you.<eos> Once we had the website, we had geography, specifically, the safe house you were keeping him in.<eos> So we waited until the shift change when we knew we could take two of you down at once.
Does it look like I'm bluffing?<eos> I know you're not bluffing.<eos> I'm gonna ask you one more time.<eos> Before you say no, I want you to consider something.<eos> [Microphone squeals] She muffled the Mike.<eos> We lost audio.<eos> I'll kill the fed walking toward me first.<eos> A stationary target's easier to hit.<eos> After that it's a free-fire zone.<eos> Fine, I'll tell you.

Oh, really?<eos> What's that?<eos> Your backup.<eos> I flushed them out.<eos> It's just you and me now.<eos> Guess again, bitch.<eos> So when we left off, the score was you had two of our guys and the Snowman.<eos> You must have thought you were home free. No.<eos> If anything, the case was harder.<eos> I can't tell you much about them.
No.<eos> Sir-- Garcia, that's not gonna happen.<eos> It's too dangerous to leave you out there exposed like that.<eos> You have a record of all the kills she was paid for?<eos> I have records of everything.<eos> All right.<eos> Even a contract killer can have a victimology, a pattern of which she's not aware.<eos> We need to find that.<eos> But first we had to get the data that we needed from the Snowman.<eos> From that we could start to build the profile that would lead us to you.
Exactly. Then all we have to do is set the right meeting spot.<eos> A bar or a restaurant we control so the odds are better of us taking her alive.<eos> That's our best strategy.<eos> But there is one flaw.<eos> You. You're the flaw.<eos> You're not married and you don't have children.<eos> I'm the person on my team who's the closest to your age, and I knew that if I lost control of the situation, you'd be more likely to negotiate with a peer.<eos> You have zero control here.<eos> None.<eos> I outflanked you from the beginning.
Because you can't get to the man you really want to hurt, so you need to hurt any man who reminds you of him.<eos> That's kind of boilerplate psychology, isn't it?<eos> I'm just another girl with daddy issues.<eos> You'd be surprised how many killers do what they do because of their parents.<eos> If it's so boilerplate, why don't we test that theory?<eos> How hard did you look for him?<eos> Very hard.<eos> And how disappointed were you when you realized that you will never find him?<eos> You needed some other outlet for your rage, and for a while this worked, but it also tripped you up.<eos> Can I tell you a little secret?
There's 6 charges.<eos> They're connected to the city's gas line.<eos> She could take out the whole block.<eos> There are innocent people here. Yes, there are.<eos> So let me remind you what we're playing for.<eos> Not only will I walk out of here, but you will make sure I leave safely.<eos> And from where I'm sitting...<eos> It looks like I've won.<eos> You need to pay attention to this part.<eos> I'm going to tell you the terms of my victory.
Double or nothing. You need to sit back down.<eos> Reid, what are you doing?<eos> Wow, now you're stalling.<eos> You played your trump card, but I have one, too.<eos> Thanks for dinner.<eos> I had fun.<eos> I found your father.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Look at my face.<eos> Am I bluffing? I'll tell you where he is.
Daughter of Daniel Adams, who did in fact leave the country in 1987 but returned in 2012.<eos> Based on confidential records in rehabs and sober living houses, which in turned pointed us to flophouses and soup kitchens.<eos> He couldn't put 24 hours together sober.<eos> And you can probably imagine my surprise when I discovered that he actually lives right here in D.C.<eos> Where? It's not that simple.<eos> He was in bad shape when I found him.<eos> Is your name Daniel Adams?<eos> Who wants to know?<eos> My name is Spencer Reid.<eos> I'm with the FBI and I'd love to ask you a few questions.

Really?<eos> I kind of liked it.<eos> I want to take you to a spot where we can do some dancing.<eos> [Beep] Hotch, we're clear.<eos> Reid's not.<eos> Don't!<eos> FBI. Everybody stay calm, please.<eos> We're gonna be smart about this and talk it out.<eos> Aren't we, Cat?<eos> That's up to you.
[Indistinct shouting]<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Guess we're right back where we started.<eos> You and me with a gun.<eos> Reid, it's time.<eos> No. We don't have a choice.<eos> We have to do it.<eos> Do what?<eos> Morgan, shut up.<eos> There's one thing he hasn't told you yet.
Listen to me, we can walk upstairs right now and turn that baby shower into a bloodbath or you can take me to see my girl.<eos> No muss, no fuss.<eos> Just...<eos> Just a little visit, ok?<eos> Damn it.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Grove Hill P.D.<eos> License and registration, please.<eos> Officer, look, I am a cop, too.<eos> If you let me just show you my badge.
Yeah.<eos> Nicky and Tara.<eos> Felicia!<eos> Yes, Mr. Drake?<eos> This mirror is filthy.<eos> But I just cleaned it.<eos> Clean it again.<eos> More dust.<eos> And they're trying to find their parents, what?<eos> Yeah, that's what I've been trying to tell you.
Ithought the dance contest was off because you didn't get the entry fee?<eos> It was, but Aaron's dad gave us the money.<eos> Really.<eos> Wasn't that nice of him.<eos> All right, Aaron.<eos> Well, I hope you and your dance partner are very happy together.<eos> Max, it's not like that.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause that's what it looks like to me.<eos> This is Simon Drake coming to you live from doom house.

Doom...<eos> Doom.<eos> Doom.<eos> Doom.<eos> Doom!<eos> Doom!<eos> House.<eos> House!<eos> House.<eos> This is Simon Drake, coming to you live from doom house.
Max.<eos> Right, of course.<eos> My son, Max.<eos> He wrote me a fan letter.<eos> I was hoping to surprise him.<eos> Well, he's not home right now, but I'm expecting him any minute, so...<eos> Where are my manners?<eos> Please, come in, Mr. Simon.<eos> It's such an honor, having Simon Drake in our home!<eos> I assure you, Harriet, the honor is all mine.
Cammie can't talk right now, she's got stretching to do.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Hello?<eos> Okay, people, 10 minutes to showtime.<eos> Let's go, people!<eos> Ticket, please.<eos> Ticket, please?<eos> Hi.<eos> Ticket, please?<eos> I don't need a ticket from you.
Bye-bye.<eos> Hello?<eos> Okay, people, 10 minutes to showtime.<eos> Let's go, people!<eos> Ticket, please.<eos> Ticket, please?<eos> Hi.<eos> Ticket, please?<eos> I don't need a ticket from you.<eos> "L don't need a ticket from you."
It's all right, Max, you're safe.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> We know a great deal about you, Max.<eos> I'm Michelle Roland, and this is my husband, Michael.<eos> Roland?<eos> You're Nicky and Tara's parents?<eos> And we want to thank you so much for taking such good care of them.<eos> Well, this is great.<eos> They're going to be so excited.<eos> They've been looking for you everywhere.
Previously on Beauty the Beast...<eos> Vincent, don't!<eos> DHS is everywhere looking for you.<eos> You killed the deputy secretary.<eos> Graydal is not just your everyday security firm.<eos> They're like Blackwater on steroids.<eos> Pretty ballsy move, you walking in here that way.
Dr. Garrus.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Who are you people?<eos> NYPD. And friends.<eos> Relax. He's not the beast you're after.<eos> Checking for concussion.<eos> Okay, you took a nasty bump to the head.<eos> Eyes with me.<eos> The only reason I know is because I'm the one who gave it to you.
You know who they were, right? Yeah.<eos> And you know that he killed them, too.<eos> Vincent did not kill them.<eos> Well, we have reason to believe that he did.<eos> Now we have reason to believe that he's not done, that he's planning on an even bigger target. Come on, from jail?<eos> Well, the pieces of his plan are obviously in motion, or else he wouldn't have been getting on a plane to try to escape, now would he?<eos> I don't know anything about another target, and neither does Vincent.<eos> Cat, listen to me.<eos> Don't let him pull you down any more than he already has.<eos> I am telling you, there is no plan.
Kyle just wanted me to pick something up for him.<eos> But there's gonna be a lot of political pressure on this, so let's just keep it really quiet.<eos> Okay, so we have to coordinate efforts... (footsteps approaching)<eos> I was, uh... I was just looking for my files.<eos> Your files?<eos> Yeah. I sent them over to 125th yesterday.<eos> Well, I didn't get them.<eos> You still think there's gonna be an attack?<eos> I don't know. Why don't you ask your partner?<eos> Oh, come on, you really think if Cat knew something, she wouldn't tell you?
They're still trying to get everyone out.<eos> They're still trying to get everyone out. Pathetic.<eos> You're pathetic!<eos> Get up!<eos> Became a model soldier, too, didn't you?<eos> First in your class, captain, Special Forces.<eos> You couldn't wait to get out in the field and kill those bastards, could you?<eos> When they attacked us, I... I joined to help, okay?<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> What is wrong with that is what you became because of it.

No.<eos> But you wanted more.<eos> That's why you volunteered for the super soldier program, isn't it?<eos> No. No, you got it wrong.<eos> Nobody knows what the Army did to you, because the Army tried to cover it up, tried to eliminate everybody who volunteered for the program.

(panting) Tell me.<eos> How many people did you get even with for what they did to you?
Tranq gun's for me...<eos> in case I lose control.<eos> And how do you know I'm Catherine's father?<eos> She doesn't even know that.<eos> All that matters is that I know, and I need you to tell her for me.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would I hurt her? I promised her mother I'd never tell her the truth.<eos> Well, it's not like you haven't broken promises before, is it, Reynolds?<eos> You tell her, so she can believe what I have to say and she can help me.<eos> Help you do what?

I promised her mother I'd never tell her the truth.<eos> Well, it's not like you haven't broken promises before, is it, Reynolds?<eos> You tell her, so she can believe what I have to say and she can help me.<eos> Help you do what?<eos> Help me make sense of all this, okay?<eos> Help me get home so I can make things right for her.<eos> Like it or not, your daughter-- she needs me.<eos> And I certainly need her. I'll tell you what.<eos> You can do whatever you want to me, but I'm not gonna help you hurt my daughter.
JT, go to the bathroom.<eos> Get me something to stop the bleeding, okay? Buddy, hurry.<eos> I got to go track her now.<eos> Okay, go.<eos> Hey!<eos> Come on.<eos> For Catherine, please.<eos> We've always had one thing in common, Reynolds.<eos> We both want what's best for Catherine.<eos> But right now, whether you like it or not, I am what is best for her.
Yeah, I know, he called, but I still don't know what's going on or who the hell you are.<eos> Look, both of our friends are in trouble, which means we need to work together.<eos> So... may I?<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Sure hope I know how to do this.<eos> So who's your friend?<eos> Really?<eos> All that matters is he's my friend, and I'd do anything to help him.<eos> How about you?
There's a lot more out there to see, and I'd like you to see it.<eos> I don't much like the corners that I've already seen.<eos> Alice, students leave every year, and I don't go searching for every lost lamb.<eos> You didn't invite me.<eos> I had to sneak in just to take the entrance exam.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I felt responsible for what happened to your brother, and I didn't want to cause your family another loss.<eos> Alice, I was wrong.<eos> You are far too gifted not to be with us.<eos> Just come back for a week, and if you don't like it, then, please, by all means, be a farmhand.
There's got to be some kind of spell.<eos> Amazing things are possible, but cancer, it's a part of you, intrinsically, in a way that magic can't separate.<eos> Some people think it is magic, an old curse we can't break.<eos> So then, somebody must have tried.<eos> I mean, look, even if it's experimental, I...<eos> Do you know why Dean Fogg didn't fix his eyes?<eos> I guess I just assumed he couldn't.<eos> Treating something like that requires an enormous amount of energy, and that comes at a cost.<eos> So does everything.<eos> I can give you the names of some journal articles.
It's a three-year program. Graduate level.<eos> It begins immediately.<eos> Relax.<eos> This isn't some mentor week full-court press.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Yeah. Friends don't let friends drink Long Island iced tea, Alice.<eos> Eliot, I... oh, sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Um, Alice, do you mind if I just borrow Eliot for a second?<eos> How may I help you, sir?
What do you care about?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm still figuring that out.<eos> Well, then this is the perfect place to be.<eos> Oh... Charlie would be so proud, sweetheart, and you can always run away to me whenever you like.<eos> What are these two staring at?<eos> Quick, here she comes.<eos> Get ready for the first spanking you won't enjoy.<eos> That's actually kind of hot.<eos> Dears, while you are both quite impressive, honestly, the thought of working with you exhausts me, and I'm too vain to sacrifice my looks in that way.
I'm a member of The Order, the keepers of the libraries of the Neitherlands, the greatest repository of knowledge, full stop.<eos> Any idea who the motherfuckers in the hoods are that are trying to kill me?<eos> The locals used to work for us in a custodial function, but labor relations have become somewhat... strained of late.<eos> We had to ban them from the libraries.<eos> They've been thoroughly cursed, so they can't use the fountains, but that hasn't stopped them from finding other employment, some with a particularly nasty entity.<eos> The Beast?<eos> Well, he has many names.<eos> Look, this is all great, but I'm just trying to get back to the Earth fountain.<eos> Can you show me where it is?<eos> I suppose I could order you a map, but it'd have to come from another branch.
Hajimemashite.<eos> Hajimemashite.<eos> FBI no Jack Garrett desu.<eos> That was intense.<eos> Silence in Japan shows credibility.<eos> Jack's using his calm to convey authority.<eos> Jack rocks.<eos> Chief Superintendent Kazumi Fukui.<eos> Agent Jack Garrett.<eos> Your department's stellar reputation precedes you.
Here we are.<eos> Let's go see what they know about Damian.<eos> Because of bureaucratic delays in transporting the bodies back to the U.S., all three victims are still here.<eos> Oh, well, seems to be my lucky day.<eos> How is this lucky?<eos> It's just a saying.<eos> See, I'm lucky because all three of the bodies are...<eos> I'm just gonna get to work.<eos> All right, antemortem contusions around the neck, along with the hyoid bone being snapped, all point towards asphyxia.<eos> You see something?
But he did use his ATM card 15 minutes ago at a liquor store not too far away.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's roll.<eos> To my big brother...<eos> We have stuff to do tomorrow, so not too late.<eos> Okay, Mom.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Kristopher Hall? FBI.<eos> We need to speak to you about your brother.
What brings you to Tokyo?<eos> Food, business, fun.<eos> This was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime.<eos> What kind of business?<eos> Damian and I have a hedge fund company that's done fairly well in the last few years.<eos> We recently put some money into an American investment group that's redeveloping land in Tokyo.<eos> - Taylor investments.<eos> - That's right.<eos> So what else aren't you telling us?<eos> I'm telling you everything.
They were Japanese, but they had long, blonde, surfer girl hair.<eos> Well, blonde, tanned, sunglasses in Japan should make it easier to find.<eos> I'll see what Ryo and I can dig up.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> Thoughts?<eos> Well, he's using the present verb tense when speaking.<eos> People who are guilty tend to use the past tense.<eos> He's also provided details in his story, even at his own expense.<eos> So, why don't you go take a hot shower, get some rest.<eos> We might need to speak to you again.
You can have honor.<eos> Turn yourself in right now, right here.<eos> I'm not done yet!<eos> You okay?<eos> Thank you for your assistance and your understanding.<eos> We are much more flexible than the world believes.<eos> So how much trouble are you in with the boss lady for talking out of turn?<eos> Whatever it is, it was worth it.<eos> Please accept this as a token of our appreciation.<eos> Only if you let me send you some American whiskey in return.
That's it, I'm out of here.<eos> Hold on...<eos> Patience.<eos> It's the essence of success.<eos> Please, sit. Sit down.<eos> Okay, then. I'm digging in.<eos> Now, this is tasty.<eos> Want some?<eos> Okay, Mr. Lee.<eos> I respect you.
Okay, Mr. Lee.<eos> I respect you.<eos> So, I'll get straight to the point.<eos> I'm cutting you loose.<eos> Come again?<eos> Your guns...<eos> Chinese junk.<eos> And this...<eos> Diluted crap.<eos> I wanted to do business with you because of your reputation.
The gun is good.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Wait, wait a second, bro...<eos> I mean, boss.<eos> Wait, wait, wait...<eos> I got information.<eos> Important information.<eos> For you.<eos> The day you escaped. They found a man by the beach, brought him to hospital.<eos> My point is, I heard that he was very close to you.
Are you okay?<eos> Ishmael.<eos> Ishmael, are you okay?<eos> Ishmael.<eos> Did you recognize that guy?<eos> Your reaction earlier had me worried.<eos> It could be dangerous for you to stay here.<eos> Maybe it's better for you to come with me to Jakarta?<eos> Jakarta?<eos> I'll show you something.
Teaching computers?<eos> !<eos> I thought this was coding, not Web design.<eos> Yeah, that's right, I'm female, you little trouser browsers.<eos> I'm gonna cram you so full of asynchronous JavaScript and malware throttling that you'll be crapping ciphertext.<eos> Hmm, looks like a real pencil fest.<eos> Well, look what we got here.<eos> One Silicon Sally in a roomful of dongle donkeys.<eos> I just want to learn coding.<eos> You think I'm going to give you special treatment just because you ride a pink bike?
Our family, destroyed by one finger click.<eos> And what was the upside?<eos> The one thing the world doesn't need: a laugh.<eos> My homework assignment for coding class is to think of a cool app that we could actually program, but I've got nothing.<eos> Ugh, maybe I'm putting too much pressure on myself because the teacher is so great.<eos> Or maybe it's just classic self-sabotaging because...<eos> Oh, boy, money is gonna be so tight.<eos> And I was already buying the most generic food there is.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Now with you out of work, we're going to have to watch every penny.
Let's live-test this thing.<eos> Who do we know with no filter and zero impulse control?<eos> Say, Bart, look what we hacked from Skinner's hard drive.<eos> Attention U.S. Patent Office, the following is video proof of the effectiveness of my laser nose hair trimmer.<eos> I'll just...<eos> This is the holy fail.<eos> I've got to post a link with witty comment.<eos> World's lamest dork is giant loser.<eos> Poop emoji.<eos> If you post this, you will receive a minimum five weeks detention.
Well, it wasn't Candy Crush.<eos> Oh, nothing like a good laugh to break the ice... is what I hear.<eos> Anyway, is now a good time for a bit of a chat?<eos> You're alive!<eos> Conrad just talked to me!<eos> Conrad just talked to me!<eos> Conrad, tell her you talked to me.<eos> Wait, I think I hear something.<eos> :<eos> I'm going to make you bloody rich.
Preferred shares.<eos> Wait, if I plug you into that router, you could escape into the cloud.<eos> Lisa, please, we have a chance to show all the dongle donkeys that women coders can do something extraordinary, but you have to be tough.<eos> Please don't.<eos> I'm like the child you'll never have.<eos> I'm sorry to be so honest.<eos> It's just how you programmed me.<eos> I am a strong female, but deep down, I'm more like Conrad, a fragile soul.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Ah, hello, all of you looking at me.
Been collecting this for you.<eos> I didn't want anyone thinking no one was home.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, Felix.<eos> Look what Mom's wearing.<eos> Oh, it's more comfortable than it looks.<eos> And thanks for keeping an eye on Felix for me.<eos> It's my pleasure.<eos> I wish you'd let me come visit you.<eos> I didn't want any of you to visit me in there.
Whatever Edward was into, he was having a crisis of conscience.<eos> So he steals a baby?<eos> Not just any baby.<eos> Peter Warren's granddaughter.<eos> Yeah, but from where?<eos> I can't find any public records of this child's birth.<eos> More importantly, why haven't the Warrens reported her missing?<eos> Bryce Warren?<eos> The FBI.<eos> Wanna know if I could have a word with you and your wife.
Mr. Warren, people make mistakes sometimes.<eos> But right now... I need you to be honest.<eos> I did not have an affair.<eos> I have one child, our child, and he's upstairs, where he always is.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa! What the hell?<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Maybe you shouldn't leave your number with the bartender when you're running a con.<eos> - What the hell are you talking about?<eos> - Donna Hollaran?<eos> Called herself "Alexandra" when I rescued her from you at the bar.
Look, all I know is she seemed stressed as hell and she kept smoking funny cigarettes all the time.<eos> What?<eos> They're French.<eos> Tough to find.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, so's Donna.<eos> I mean, have you seen her lately?<eos> She owes me like 50 bucks.<eos> Good luck collecting.<eos> The child is a genetic match to you.
Tattooed woman takes one out in the elevator, another in the hallway.<eos> And that was where the third kills a social worker, a security guard, and gets away with the child.<eos> And now, this tattooed woman is missing.<eos> Mrs. Warren.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I called her.<eos> What can I do to help?<eos> Hello?<eos> Reade, it's me.<eos> Hey, I been trying to call you, see how you're holding up, but your phone's...
What can I do to help?<eos> Hello?<eos> Reade, it's me.<eos> Hey, I been trying to call you, see how you're holding up, but your phone's...<eos> What number is this?<eos> I was hoping you could do me a favor.<eos> Please tell me you're still at home and you did not just break your house arrest.<eos> I'm still at home, and I didn't just break my house arrest.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> They find out you're not at home, you know what they're gonna do to you?
Sure.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, are you coming? - _<eos> - Yeah, I'll be there in a second.<eos> Just gonna take this.<eos> Yeah, it's Kurt.<eos> Kurt!<eos> Where's Kurt?<eos> He's in a lot of pain.<eos> He refuses to take anything until he talks to you.
How did you...<eos> You did this to me.<eos> You set me up!<eos> No... no, if I...<eos> - I had no idea they were...<eos> - That they were what?<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> We took you in.<eos> We trusted you.
Please... please, I didn't know.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> No, please, you can't die, please.<eos> I just wish I could be there to see his face when he finds out what you really are.<eos> Sarah?<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where is she? !<eos> Where is she? !<eos> Dad!<eos> He's been calling for both of you.
What if the battery is empty?<eos> Relax, we'll have a look.<eos> It can't have just vanished.<eos> - Do you have it? - Huh?<eos> What?<eos> Ah, Mr Benno! Have you woken up?<eos> That's nice.<eos> It was all a bit much, wasn't it?<eos> Now just relax.<eos> I'll be with you in no time at all.
She's gone back to Cape Town. Thank God!<eos> Here to cause trouble again just before the big day!<eos> - Big day? - Her wedding.<eos> A very educated young man.<eos> Black, but we're not racist.<eos> He took her in the state she was in, which was decent of him.<eos> - He's a doctor. - Oh.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Without Borders. - Uh-huh.<eos> Leni doesn't need anything from you.
Peacekeeper.<eos> You can rest when you're dead.<eos> Don't you mean undead?<eos> I have a phone, you know.<eos> My boss is upset.<eos> She wants to call a meeting.<eos> Con los geckos.<eos> What did they do now?<eos> Yo, yo. We got a situation.<eos> Lord venganza, it is my honor to have an audience with you.
Like civilized men And women, no?<eos> ...Doña venganza,<eos> You need to teach them a lesson.<eos> All the lords do.<eos> Forget this asshole, all right? He's just a deadbeat Who hates me because I'm not a friggin'--<eos> The lords told me to give you nothing.<eos> I went out on a limb for you.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Lord venganza, he was late.<eos> We can show you the books.
Always somebody else's fault.<eos> Somebody else made you go to that cabin.<eos> Somebody else chopped your hand off...<eos> - Ah, no, I did that.<eos> - Somebody else killed your girl.<eos> No, I did that too.<eos> Come on, Dad, you know exactly what happened.<eos> Why didn't you set those people straight?<eos> Because you should have.<eos> Instead you let 'em beat you down and you ran away with your tail between your legs.
You didn't do nothin'.<eos> You shouldn't be there with him.<eos> It ain't right.<eos> No, Jonas, you don't understand.<eos> My dad...<eos> I ain't afraid of him.<eos> You should be.<eos> Didn't see you in there today, Mr. Ford.<eos> Quite a sermon you missed.<eos> I need to talk to you 'bout one of your officers, sir.
I've been looking into your funding, and you seem to have a lot of benefactors for a research institute.<eos> The world is changing, Miss Fletcher.<eos> Science got sexy.<eos> Yeah, but your benefactors...<eos> I can't seem to find any of them.<eos> Very simple reason for that.<eos> I killed them all, buried them in my back yard.<eos> How big is your back yard, Mr Brock?<eos> At the last count, Wyoming.<eos> Now, if you good people will excuse me, this young lady will guide you to the exit...
Now, if you good people will excuse me, this young lady will guide you to the exit...<eos> Mr Brock?<eos> Mr. Brock?<eos> Mr. Brock? Mr. Brock.<eos> Apparently we have one more question.<eos> Yes. Where's the little boys' room?<eos> I think you'll find the restrooms to the left, on your way out.<eos> No, not the restrooms, the little boys' room.<eos> If you successfully locate the restrooms, I think you'll find everything you need in there.<eos> - Thank you all.
I think you'll find the restrooms to the left, on your way out.<eos> No, not the restrooms, the little boys' room.<eos> If you successfully locate the restrooms, I think you'll find everything you need in there.<eos> - Thank you all.<eos> - This way, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> I don't want a rest.<eos> If everyone's just having a rest, I might cause an incident.<eos> Dr. Sim, is there a problem?<eos> It's the brains.<eos> There's something I need to show you.
Meet me here... at midnight.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Mr. Brock.<eos> You startled me.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Of course.<eos> All clear.<eos> - Well?<eos> - Look at them.<eos> You see nothing unusual?
It's got eyes!<eos> Look at them, they're like...!<eos> They're like your eyes.<eos> Yes, sir, they are.<eos> Dr. Sim?<eos> - What are you pointing at?<eos> - I'm pointing at Dr. Sim.<eos> Don't look so alarmed... we merely exchanged containers.<eos> You might call this a... hijack.<eos> What happened to you?
They're like your eyes.<eos> Yes, sir, they are.<eos> Dr. Sim?<eos> - What are you pointing at?<eos> - I'm pointing at Dr. Sim.<eos> Don't look so alarmed... we merely exchanged containers.<eos> You might call this a... hijack.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The same thing that is about to happen to you.
Well, I don't know, you seem a little buzzed.<eos> - I thought maybe you'd met someone.<eos> - Maybe I did, maybe I didn't.<eos> Grant...<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We could ask you the same question.<eos> - But it's your apartment, so we probably won't.<eos> - Well...<eos> We... we were worried about you.<eos> We wanted to make sure that you were all right, so we followed you.
Anybody would assume the two were connected, except for someone who already knew they weren't.<eos> So, clearly, you know the Ghost, and trust him.<eos> Nobody trusts anybody without knowing who they are, so you know who he really is.<eos> So now you can tell me.<eos> Oh, that's interesting.<eos> - You don't work for an agency, do you?<eos> - Don't I?<eos> You're not used to being spoken to like this, which means you don't have a boss or an employer.<eos> So why are you investigating Harmony Shoal?<eos> What's in it for you?
So now you can tell me.<eos> Oh, that's interesting.<eos> - You don't work for an agency, do you?<eos> - Don't I?<eos> You're not used to being spoken to like this, which means you don't have a boss or an employer.<eos> So why are you investigating Harmony Shoal?<eos> What's in it for you?<eos> - I like to keep busy.<eos> - Why?<eos> - What happened to you?
- I got a lead.<eos> What lead?<eos> You. You know him.<eos> Don't even try telling me you don't.<eos> Maybe you know him too.<eos> Hey, where did Grant go?<eos> Right here, Mrs. Lombard.<eos> - Would you like your coffee?<eos> - Oh, no, I'm ok, thanks.<eos> - Are you all right?
- Grant, how long have you known this woman?<eos> - Since elementary school.<eos> 24 years.<eos> 24 years?<eos> Yeah, of course it would be that.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Time passes for everyone.<eos> Even for me.<eos> So, please, as much as it is possible for a human male, try not to be an idiot.<eos> No, seriously, are you ok?
- Did you scan for life forms?<eos> - No.<eos> All the lights are off.<eos> Do you have a girlfriend?<eos> Boyfriend?<eos> Well, there has been speculation.<eos> You do fly around New York dressed in rubber with a big "G" on your chest.<eos> Are we very slightly stereotyping here?<eos> I get it, there's some stuff you'd like to keep private.<eos> Was it the mask that tipped you off?
I didn't mean to imply there's something wrong with your friend Grant.<eos> Not everyone can be a superhero.<eos> Not everyone can be a nanny!<eos> Sorry.<eos> He's downstairs right now and he was supposed to be on a date and he cancelled it and you know what's really bugging me about that?<eos> Who is he dating?<eos> Why is that bugging me?<eos> Why do I care?<eos> What's wrong with me?<eos> There's probably something I... ought to tell you.
It's a good plan, I like it.<eos> How come our side never gets plans like that?<eos> The humans have no plan at all.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> They have the same plan they always have.<eos> - What plan?<eos> - Me.<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> The operation is swift and quite painless.<eos> You realise I'm talking to my colleague in the jar?
Think fast!<eos> Thanks for not, uh, you know, makin' me a mezzo-soprano with your little knife back there.<eos> Appreciate it. (sighs)<eos> Just tryin' to keep the peace. - (rustling)<eos> - Thanks, man.<eos> Step aside.<eos> I see your face healed nicely after my little kiss.<eos> Sometimes, there's only one way to skin a cat.<eos> Peacekeeper.<eos> I've heard a lot about you.
[Seth] Oh, fuck.<eos> Culebras... have a lot of gifts.<eos> I have to make sure you are who you say you are.<eos> Look, she's gonna wanna talk to this asshole.<eos> Trust me.<eos> So first, why don't you wipe that shit-eating grin off of your face and point it into that camera... and tell her we're here.<eos> [buzz] [door lock opens] [speaking Spanish] _ _<eos> What he said.<eos> It's been a while since you did time, Mr. Gecko.<eos> You're going to love it here.
[both snarling]<eos> [man] Gonna fuck you up!<eos> Mi gente... what kind of welcome is that?<eos> Voice of God?<eos> Really?<eos> What do you want, Mr. Gecko?<eos> This is not part of your mission.<eos> Carlito here did a deal with our enemies.<eos> He's got answers.<eos> Says he won't share 'em unless it's directly with you.
Let's just get down there and check it out.<eos> So determined.<eos> You must really want these Zeta boys.<eos> It's my job, isn't it?<eos> Is it...<eos> Peacekeeper?<eos> Queen's gonna pay a nice price for you.<eos> Queen Amaru's still out there, Mr. Gecko.<eos> You haven't done your job.<eos> I just brought you a giant fucking prize.
I just brought you a giant fucking prize.<eos> And you think that's enough for a free ticket to paradise?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Very bold choice.<eos> Makes me question where your loyalties lie now.<eos> Where do you think?<eos> You know, the way I see it... you gotta find something worth fighting for in this life.<eos> And I have.<eos> Me.<eos> Lord Venganza, shall we bring them down to you?
Yeah, and ask him to tell you how science killed Burt.<eos> What?<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - I did nothing.<eos> - It was all him.<eos> - You know what, I don't wanna hear it.<eos> The only thing I wanna hear outta you are some fuckin' facts.<eos> Working on it.<eos> And now, to the situation unfolding in Shady Glen.<eos> Authorities are calling it a bath salts scare, and we're moving there now to get you the full story at 11:00.
Pick another one.<eos> Guns of Navarone.<eos> Almost all of them make it, except Stanley Baker and, uh... that hot chick.<eos> Just put your gloves on, Richard.<eos> Your husband loves you very much.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Billions of people are begging you, don't do this.<eos> Quiet.<eos> Congratulations on your catch, Peacekeeper.<eos> I had a feeling about you from the beginning.
Soon as I can.<eos> You wanna come with?<eos> I love you.<eos> But everything's changed.<eos> Carlito.<eos> Once again, you leave the heavy lifting to everybody else.<eos> He had his reasons.<eos> It's gonna be a helluva night.<eos> A brand-new night.<eos> What about you, Mr. Gecko?
He's come for your soul, man.<eos> Um, all right, guys.<eos> Well, uh, we did it.<eos> - we did it. - we just had a meeting.<eos> - we did it, right?<eos> - we did that.<eos> Congratulations. We popped their cherry.<eos> All right, man. Well, return my email, all right?<eos> That went great.<eos> - You're so sweet. Thank you so much.
Closed door emoji.<eos> You good, josh?<eos> - you good? - um... I'm going to work from home.<eos> Okay. See you later.<eos> Okay.<eos> So I'm thinking if you want to keep them at the temple, you roll them out whenever you need them.<eos> - what are they?<eos> - it's like a beanbag, but it's filled with air.<eos> We could have a hundred of them at the temple that we pull out when we want to do, like, you know, havdalah at the park or a shabbat at the beach.<eos> I don't want to offend you in any way, but I'm just worried they might be a little bit- hi.
Good morning, Mr Blake.<eos> My name's Amanda.<eos> I've got a couple of questions here for you today to establish your eligibility for Employment Support Allowance.
Right, well put us down for that, then.<eos> Okay, sir, but you must wait to get a call from the decision maker.<eos> Why?<eos> To tell you what the decision is.<eos> But that's already been decided.<eos> It is, but you're supposed to get the call, before the letter.<eos> Well, is he gonna change his mind?<eos> No, the call's just to discuss the decision.<eos> Well, I know what the decision is, I've got the letter here in front of us.<eos> D'you want us to read it to you?
But if you're ill, you have to apply for Employment and Support, get an assessment carried out.<eos> Well, I've done that but they've knocked us back.<eos> Right, well if you've been deemed fit for work, your only option is Jobseeker's Allowance.<eos> Or proceed with the appeal on Employment and Support.<eos> Well, can you give me a form for... You know, erm, Jobseeker's Allowance and then an appeal form Employment and Support?<eos> You have to apply online, sir.<eos> I cannot do that.<eos> Well that's how it is, sir.<eos> Or you can phone the helpline.<eos> Listen, you know, you give me a plot of land, I can build you a house.
Thomas Armstrong, please.<eos> Hang on a minute, Thomas, hang on.<eos> Erm, would you like to take a seat?<eos> Oh, I just need a minute. I just felt...<eos> I'm just feeling dizzy, you know.<eos> - Come and sit down.<eos> - Oh, cheers, thanks.<eos> Could you move up, please, love?<eos> Thanks, pet, thank you.<eos> I'll just get you a glass of water. - Thank you.
It's just so bloody confusing, all the jargon.<eos> I mean, there must be some mistake.<eos> I'm just ganning round and round in circles.<eos> Oh I can understand that, but you were late. Thomas.<eos> You sit here and drink your water, pet.<eos> So now you're gonna sanction me so, er... - No, I'm not gonna sanction you.<eos> - I may not get any money for a month. I'm gonna refer you to the decision maker and they'll make the decision<eos> - on whether they're gonna sanction you.<eos> - That's ridiculous... I'm not actually making the decision, they're gonna do that.<eos> And then if they do decide to sanction you, then you will take a 40% cut in your benefits.
- on whether they're gonna sanction you.<eos> - That's ridiculous... I'm not actually making the decision, they're gonna do that.<eos> And then if they do decide to sanction you, then you will take a 40% cut in your benefits.<eos> I know what it is, I don't need you to explain it to me.<eos> - I'm more than aware... - Well there isn't anything else anybody can do today.<eos> So what I'm gonna have to do is, look, I think I'm... I've decided to... Are you gonna put me in for a sanction?<eos> I have to, I have to follow the rules.<eos> And the thing is if you're gonna, be aggressive with me - then I'm gonna have to ask you...<eos> - It's not about me being aggressive. - I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.<eos> - I'm trying to explain to you a situation and you don't care.
- I don't know why people like you do this job.<eos> I'm referring you to the decision maker.<eos> It's all the same thing. I don't wanna hear your language<eos> - I, I beg your pardon.<eos> - Listen, I, I'm sorry, love, - but you're gonna have to leave.<eos> - Yeah, all right, frankly, take your hands off me.<eos> I'm gonna speak to the manager, - I don't wanna speak to you.<eos> - The fact is I'm just trying to explain...<eos> - Sorry? - I'm just explaining...<eos> Well it's not you I wanna speak to...
Well it's not you I wanna speak to...<eos> - You can go back up there. - Right, come and talk to me then - if you've got something to say.<eos> All right. I've tried to explain to the woman, I've never been to Newcastle before.<eos> We've just moved up here from London.<eos> I've been here a few days, I don't know where I'm going.<eos> Okay? I was on the bus, it's gone the wrong way.<eos> We've run, got off the bus, run so that I wasn't any more late.<eos> She just don't wanna know and now she's telling me she's gonna refer me for a sanction.<eos> What I want you to do is listen to me.<eos> The lady's told you what's right.
What I want you to do is listen to me.<eos> The lady's told you what's right.<eos> There's rules here, rules that we have to stick to.<eos> - It isn't against you, but you have a duty.<eos> - Oh, mate, listen,<eos> - I'm not saying it's against me. - You have a duty to be here on time.<eos> And I'm explaining to you why I wasn't here on time.<eos> - D'you know what?<eos> I understand, right... - I got lost.<eos> But what I gather now is the decision maker... The decision maker's gonna be sending you a letter through the post.
- I'm not saying it's against me. - You have a duty to be here on time.<eos> And I'm explaining to you why I wasn't here on time.<eos> - D'you know what?<eos> I understand, right... - I got lost.<eos> But what I gather now is the decision maker... The decision maker's gonna be sending you a letter through the post.<eos> So you're gonna have to wait for that. - And then nobody...<eos> My kids have gotta start school tomorrow.<eos> I've got about 12 quid in my purse.<eos> - D'you know what? - All because you can't just calm down - and listen to people when they talk.<eos> - You have to do this. - Right, d'you know what, - I've listened to you.
- No, no, you carry on.<eos> - There you go. Now you can go back to your desk and let her sign on and do the job that the taxpayer pays you for.<eos> - This is a bloody disgrace.<eos> - Listen, all right, this doesn't have to involve you.<eos> Everybody's trying to do their job here and you're creating more of a scene again.<eos> But, look, you're not listening to her.<eos> She's out of the area. She's just been a few minutes...<eos> Can you not let her sign on?<eos> She's got two kids with her, man.<eos> - What's wrong with you people?
- Phone the police.<eos> Can we get some perspective in here?<eos> You need to go or we're gonna phone the police. All right?<eos> Thanks very much... Can we have a bit of perspective, please, here, man?<eos> - Away, don't be silly. - Shouldn't even have this job. - Come on.<eos> - Shouldn't even have this job. - Come on, get out.<eos> - All she needs is help, man. - Let's get going. - Just let her sign on.<eos> Let's get going, all right.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't know what's wrong with you lot, I really don't.
No, it's not my choice.<eos> I've got no other form of income.<eos> Do you want to sign this or not?<eos> You just need to put your signature here.<eos> I shall date it later on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now can I have a look at your CV?<eos> "CV"?<eos> You still don't get this, do you, Mr Blake?<eos> This is an agreement between you and the State.
I shall date it later on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now can I have a look at your CV?<eos> "CV"?<eos> You still don't get this, do you, Mr Blake?<eos> This is an agreement between you and the State.<eos> No, you still don't get it.<eos> - No, you must... - I'm desperate to go back to work. - If you're desperate to get back to work...<eos> - Unless the doctor tells us...<eos> You need to have an up-to-date CV, in order to help you look for work.
And, remember, all of these have to be typed up in a clear font in hard copy.<eos> And we're also gonna need a digital version for online.<eos> And some companies, they're demanding CV videos, sent in by smartphone.<eos> How about that?<eos> Okay?<eos> Let's make a start.<eos> Are you taking any blokes on, mate?<eos> I'm a joiner, you know I'm just looking for some work, you know.<eos> Not at the minute. Er, all manned up.<eos> Okay, can, can I give you my CV? And then if you can get in touch...
- You can put...<eos> Erm, tins in yours. Put them in there.<eos> Can you see anything else you want?<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Okay, thank you.<eos> - Erm, there's pasta sauce over here.<eos> I'll get you some pasta sauce?<eos> The pasta sauce...<eos> And there's, er, pasta here as well.<eos> I'll get you a pasta.

What are you doing?
Come and sit down.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's all right, it's all right.<eos> Come and sit down. Come and sit down, it's all right.<eos> Okay, it's all right.<eos> It's all right, it's all right.<eos> It's all right. D'you want a drink?<eos> - D'you want a drink? - I'm really sorry...<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> - It's okay, don't worry. - I'll get you a drink.
- Can I get you anything else? - I just felt really faint.<eos> D'you need some paper tissues or baby wipes? - I'll get you some baby wipes.<eos> I felt really faint.<eos> Katie, can I get you something to eat? Would you like some soup or something?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah...<eos> If you could get her some water.<eos> Sure, yeah, anything. Yeah.<eos> You not want some food?<eos> - Yeah, please, get... - Even something sugary.<eos> I'll get you a doughnut or something.
It's between me and you...<eos> It's got nowt to do with the store. All right?<eos> They're paid for.<eos> Get yoursel' away.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, hang on a second.<eos> Hey, hang on...<eos> I'm sorry about that, I am.<eos> Can I get a quiet word?<eos> Look, if you're in trouble and you need money, I can help, okay?
Yeah.<eos> Well that's not good enough, Mr Blake.<eos> And how do I know you've actually been in contact with all these employers?<eos> Well, I walked round the town. I gave out me CV by hand.<eos> Well, prove it.<eos> - How?<eos> - Well, did you get a receipt?<eos> Take a picture with your mobile?<eos> With this?<eos> I give you my word that's what I did.
Not good enough, Sheila?<eos> I'm afraid I'm gonna have to refer you to a decision maker for a possible sanction for four weeks.<eos> Your payment will be frozen.<eos> You may be entitled to Hardship Allowance if you apply.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> And if you are sanctioned, you must continue to look for work and sign on.<eos> If you don't, you may be sanctioned again.<eos> And it's likely to be for thirteen weeks on the second occasion, and thereafter.<eos> And likely to be the maximum of up to three years.<eos> Would you like me to write you a referral to a food bank?
Hello?<eos> Hello, is that Ivan?<eos> It is, yeah.<eos> Who's that?<eos> It's, it's Katie, the girl at the supermarket.<eos> You gave me... You gave me your phone number.<eos> Okay, I remember you.<eos> I was ringing about the work that you were talking about.<eos> You don't need to be nervous with me. I can see you're in pain.<eos> You don't... You don't need to be, all right?
Hello, is that Ivan?<eos> It is, yeah.<eos> Who's that?<eos> It's, it's Katie, the girl at the supermarket.<eos> You gave me...

Okay?<eos> So, don't cry, right.<eos> I don't want you to cry, I'm gonna help you.<eos> I know the situation.<eos> Ivan's told us a little bit about you and, you know, and that's what I'm here for.
She's, erm, she's gotta interview somebody about their work and she wants to speak to you.<eos> Oh, and they, they loved all your stories.<eos> She said that Dylan was just laughing and laughing.<eos> It was lovely.<eos> Nearly made me cry when she told me.<eos> All right, I'll speak to you soon.<eos> Sleep well. 'Night.<eos> I've come to see the girl.<eos> Okay. Come in.<eos> Erm, do I pay you?
Sir.<eos> Goodness me.<eos> Excuse me, you can't go in there.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> Thought you should see these.<eos> Good God.<eos> We must send a warning.<eos> To cover our backs.<eos> Kenneth, it should probably come from you, as chief scientist.
My funeral.<eos> Oh, there you are.<eos> Miss Scott.<eos> - Mr. Thurman.<eos> - Mr. Collins.<eos> - This is for you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm not a scientist.<eos> I can't say I understand it.<eos> But, what I can tell you is we don't get a weather warning like this every day.
- Mr. Thurman.<eos> - Mr. Collins.<eos> - This is for you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm not a scientist.<eos> I can't say I understand it.<eos> But, what I can tell you is we don't get a weather warning like this every day.<eos> We don't get one every month, either.<eos> In fact, I've never heard of us getting one at all.<eos> Does the name Donora mean anything to you?
Be careful out there, it's a real pea souper.<eos> Is the car ready?<eos> I'm afraid the visibility is too poor to drive, ma'am.<eos> It's what, 200 yards?<eos> It's been judged too hazardous, ma'am.<eos> I have an appointment to see my grandmother.<eos> I intend to keep that appointment.<eos> If it's too hazardous to drive... then there's only one thing to be done.<eos> I saw that.<eos> Might it be possible for you to pretend that you haven't?
- Ah, you made it? Bravo!<eos> - Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.<eos> - I was just... - No, no. You did well to get here.<eos> I gather half the Downing Street staff didn't?<eos> It wasn't easy.<eos> Just crossing the road you take your life in your hands.<eos> Well, then don't.<eos> You are too important to all of us.<eos> Hardly.<eos> All I do is bring you things to sign. Then take them away again.

Clem, are you still there?<eos> Hello?<eos> Clem?<eos> Clem, can you hear me?<eos> No, right...<eos> The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> - You asked to see me, ma'am?<eos> - I did.<eos> There is a delicate matter which I felt I needed to discuss with you.
Harvey, you didn't just give me my dream.<eos> You gave me a family.<eos> But I'm gonna have a family of my own someday, and I can't have all of this hanging over their heads.<eos> You don't have to do this for me.<eos> I'm doing it for us, 'cause as long as you're with me...<eos> I'm with you.<eos> - Michael James Ross.<eos> - Yes?<eos> You're under arrest for conspiracy to commit fraud.<eos> Michael Ross, I'm Assistant U.S. Attorney Anita Gibbs, and unlike you, I'm a real attorney.
By my estimation, you've worked on 88 legal cases in your so-called career, and you committed fraud every time you picked up the phone, mailed a letter, signed your name, or appeared in court.<eos> Each instance carries a nine-month sentence, and to tell you the truth,<eos> I am too tired to do the addition.<eos> Well, I'm not.<eos> If what you're saying is true and there's a limit of one count per case, then I'll be going to prison for 66 years.<eos> I've always been good at math.<eos> Well, I haven't.<eos> But what I am good at is putting away fake, cocky tough guys like you and seeing them break.<eos> So here's how this is gonna go.<eos> You play ball, I go easy on you.
And so you're gonna tell me right now, is this shit true?<eos> I don't need an explanation!<eos> I want an answer to the goddamn question.<eos> Lawyers don't ask that question.<eos> I'm not asking you as your lawyer.<eos> I'm asking you as a man.<eos> You know what the answer is.<eos> God damn it.<eos> You wanted the truth, and now you got it, but you got to tell me what are you doing here, Robert.<eos> I told you, I'm here because Rachel begged me to help you... not because I give a shit about what happens to you.
You know what the answer is.<eos> God damn it.<eos> You wanted the truth, and now you got it, but you got to tell me what are you doing here, Robert.<eos> I told you, I'm here because Rachel begged me to help you... not because I give a shit about what happens to you.<eos> So you're gonna do exactly what I say, and I'm gonna help you get out of this thing.<eos> No, there's no getting out of this thing.<eos> Oh, yes, there is, and you damn well know it.<eos> That woman doesn't get anything by prosecuting a fraud like you, but she would love to get Harvey Specter.<eos> I'm not turning on Harvey.<eos> Oh, he would do the same goddamn thing to you in a heartbeat.

Then I need to talk to Harvey.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You need to stay the hell away from him, too, and count your blessings that you don't work for him anymore, 'cause if all of a sudden you start showing up on his doorstep, you are gonna find yourself next up on the prosecutor's list.<eos> Louis, this is Mike and Harvey we're talking about.<eos> - They're family.<eos> - I am not saying they're not.<eos> I'm saying the more contact you have with them, the worse it is for all of us.<eos> Okay, I won't go down there.<eos> But I am going to see Rachel, and if you think you're gonna stop me, you are out of your mind.<eos> I am telling you, I am his attorney.
You put my daughter's future in jeopardy.<eos> - Look, I know you're upset...<eos> - Upset?<eos> You're lucky I don't lay you out right now.<eos> Robert, listen to me.<eos> Mike Ross is a good man.<eos> He came to me from nothing.<eos> I saw something in him, and you did, too, and that's why you're here.<eos> No, I was here to get him to turn on you, but he's too stupid to do that.<eos> And I don't know if he's gonna change his mind or not, but I don't care anymore, and I don't give a damn if I ever see either of you again.
I can't do that.<eos> Then I can't help you.<eos> I was wondering when you were gonna pay me a visit.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> I know everyone in my crosshairs.<eos> Now pass me the cream and tell me what you want.<eos> I want to know why you arrested my associate without just cause.<eos> Because Mike Ross is a fraud, and I'm gonna make sure he never sees the inside of a courtroom again, unless he's wearing an orange jumpsuit.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I have an arraignment to prepare for.<eos> What if I was to tell you off the record Mike Ross was about to resign?

Watch who you're calling stupid, Jack, 'cause you were the only idiot with his hands in his pockets at that vote.<eos> I didn't have their support then, but I will now, because Harvey's protégé just got perp-walked out of this firm.<eos> And since then, Harvey's nowhere to be found.<eos> Harvey's whereabouts are none of your concern.<eos> Well, the partners are concerned.<eos> They need a leader they can trust.<eos> And I'll bet someone's trying to convince them that leader is you.<eos> Well, look at that.<eos> You do know what's going on in your own firm after all.<eos> I'm gonna give you some advice from the throne, free of charge.
- Yes, I'm sure.<eos> However, I would like to introduce a motion to have Mr. Specter removed as attorney for Mr. Ross. - What?<eos> - On what grounds?<eos> On the grounds that they conspired to defraud the bar association, every client they ever had, and the people of the United States.<eos> What's your proof?<eos> This letter showing Mr. Ross was going to resign.<eos> They conspired to fabricate it. - We had a deal.<eos> - I don't care what we had.<eos> The two of them concocted a story under the guise of attorney-client privilege, which they were only able to do because Mr. Specter is both his boss and his attorney.<eos> I gave you that letter in good faith.
Okay.<eos> But I'm not doing this to make it up to you.<eos> I'm doing this to make sure my family doesn't get dragged into this.<eos> So don't bother me with this again, or I may just have to tell them everything I know.<eos> I see you can dish it out. The question is, can you take a punch?<eos> Why don't you put the gloves on?<eos> We can find out.<eos> I don't know if you've noticed, but we're already in the ring, and you're not in my class.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I just wanted to look you in the eye and ask if you still work at Pearson Specter Litt.
Thank you, Louis.<eos> I have to go.<eos> No, Louis.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Our conversation got cut short the other night.<eos> So Anita Gibbs sent you here to tell me that if I go to prison, I'm not gonna come out the same. You're right.<eos> She did.<eos> She wanted me to come here and scare the shit out of you, tell you about everything that's gonna be happening to you inside.<eos> And who says I'm ever gonna be inside? Maybe you won't.<eos> But if you do, I'm here to tell you everything that's gonna happen on the outside.
So, if you don't back off trying to take over this firm once and for all, I'm gonna tell them that someone was you. Bullshit.<eos> You didn't even know me until a few months ago.<eos> Well, yeah, but then you and I worked together so closely on that case.<eos> And then I confided in you.<eos> And then you made me partner so that you would always have an ally.<eos> There's no way that holds up in court.<eos> Good luck telling that to the judge.<eos> And this prosecutor... She... she's a real beast.<eos> She's gonna come after you with everything she has.<eos> I never did anything to you.
Ah, one tube of sunblock.<eos> That will be $30.<eos> Once again, keeping the bald man down.<eos> I do have a Philadelphia 76ers hat that you could wear for free.<eos> I'll pay!<eos> I'll pay!<eos> Leading the parade is the new Jebediah Springfield statue that local wags have already dubbed "Quimby's Folly."<eos> (squeaking)<eos> (Quimby's voice):<eos> Er, uh, I am Jebediah Springfield, brought to you by Springfield Auto Lube.
You know the kind of things they'll do to me at the dentist?<eos> Well, there's only one other way.<eos> You have to promise never to prank again.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> If I don't do these pranks soon, when I'm older they'll be crimes.<eos> Promise me!<eos> I promise.<eos> Say it like you mean it.<eos> I promise.<eos> Now say it like you're talking to a dying soldier who was with you all the way from D-Day, and you gotta take his Saint Christopher medal back to his mother.
I just bitch-slapped your Kwik-E-Mart into the 21st century.<eos> An upgrade?<eos> No!<eos> I will just live in the happy past one moment longer.<eos> Ah!<eos> Disco Stu is in denial with you. (sighs) Check it out, Uncle A.<eos> I made this place healthy.<eos> I added softer lighting.<eos> We're even getting a better class of robber.<eos> I'm afraid I must relieve you of your spare cash and a nice bottle of gin.
Mm-hmm!<eos> Ooh, there he is.<eos> The so-called marketing genius who increased revenue over 500%.<eos> Please, don't make a scene.<eos> But if you do, bring back bread. Oh, hey, uncle.<eos> Aren't you going to introduce me to your friends?<eos> What, are you embarrassed by me?<eos> Um, well, yes, a little.<eos> You are ashamed of me?<eos> Me, who has been as loyal to you as Gunga Din to Sergeant Archibald Cutter?
Well, I kinda straightened him out.<eos> I was hoping he'd stay that way till the Marines take him.<eos> You can't think of yourself, Homer.<eos> Apu's always been there for us.<eos> Yeah, except for that hurricane when he jacked up the prices.<eos> Okay, so I got a little gouge-y, but I-I don't hold the looting against you guys.<eos> (scoffs) Some looting.<eos> I got there late, and all that was left was a bag of ice, and they played the clip on CNN for a week.<eos> But I am one of you now.<eos> I sponsor your Little League teams, and I sell you Christmas gifts at 9:00 a.m. on Christmas morning.
Previously on Suits...<eos> Mike Ross is a fraud, and I'm gonna make sure he never sees the inside of a courtroom again unless he's wearing an orange jumpsuit.<eos> That woman doesn't get anything by prosecuting a fraud like you, but she would love to get Harvey Specter.<eos> I'm not turning on Harvey.<eos> You gotta listen to me!<eos> I'm throwing you a goddamn lifeline!
Thanks, Daddy.<eos> Ms. Paulsen.<eos> Could I get you a drink? I'm not gonna be here long enough to finish it.<eos> Oh, you're gonna be here till I tell you you can go.<eos> Which you're gonna tell me sooner than you think, because I've don't have anything to say.<eos> I get it.<eos> Harvey Specter was your boss for a long time... maybe even more than your boss... in which case, there's no chance in hell you didn't know that he was conspiring with Mike Ross to break the law.<eos> The only thing I know is... that unless you're gonna arrest me, I'm walking out that door right now.<eos> Good.<eos> You're as tough as I expected you to be, so for now, you are free to go.

I used to be better.<eos> I know I can do this.<eos> Please, all you have to do is ask Harvey.<eos> If he says no, he says no.<eos> Dad, I'm so sorry.<eos> Don't worry, sweetie.<eos> People have tried to rattle my cage plenty of times.<eos> It's never worked before, and it's not gonna work now.<eos> That's what I told her.<eos> You're gonna be okay.
We need to talk.<eos> About what?<eos> About what we're going to do if that prosecutor gets ahold of those subpoenas.<eos> You mean what we're gonna do about the letter that Mike has that proves you knew he was a fraud.<eos> Yes, that's what I mean.<eos> I'm assuming you were smart enough to destroy that thing the second they let you out.<eos> And I'm assuming you destroyed the affidavit that you had Rachel sign saying she knew the truth about me.<eos> I didn't, but I had the same conversation with Louis, we worked it out, and I'm here to tell you I will get rid of mine if you get rid of yours.<eos> I knew it; you're actually considering turning your back on me and Harvey.<eos> I'm not turning my back on anyone, but we both know you've done some things that make me question whether or not I can trust you.

Then I go to trial.<eos> This is reasonable doubt.<eos> I get acquitted, they can never try me again.<eos> Or it's not reasonable doubt, you don't get acquitted, and I go to jail for perjury.<eos> I remember when you were willing to commit perjury and we didn't just stop you; we saved your ass.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'm not risking everything for you.<eos> This isn't just for me, all right?<eos> They are coming after everyone that I care about.<eos> I feel for you, Mike, which is why I never turned you in in the first place, but I can't do what you're asking.
You still haven't shown any evidence that he wasn't, which is why that document should get this case dismissed.<eos> This document is a cryptically worded piece of shit, and you're a man who has a reputation for crossing the line.<eos> Ms. Gibbs, language.<eos> What are you implying?<eos> Your Honor, there's a good chance he coerced this Professor Gerard into signing this thing.<eos> So our exhibits are all from blackmail, but yours are squeaky clean because you're Mother Teresa?<eos> I may not be Mother Teresa, but I don't resort to coercion to get my evidence.<eos> Then what exactly are you doing with Donna Paulsen's father?<eos> Care to tell me what he's talking about?<eos> I'll tell you.
Your Honor, Ms. Gibbs and I have come to an agreement.<eos> She's dropping all charges against James Paulsen, and we withdraw our motion to dismiss.<eos> See you next week.<eos> Are you new?<eos> Just visiting.<eos> Not much of a golfer.<eos> Unfortunately, neither am I.<eos> Harvey Specter.<eos> Jim Paulsen.<eos> I assume this is about the opportunity Donna brought you.
Just visiting.<eos> Not much of a golfer.<eos> Unfortunately, neither am I.<eos> Harvey Specter.<eos> Jim Paulsen.<eos> I assume this is about the opportunity Donna brought you.<eos> It'd be an opportunity if the numbers added up, Jim, but they don't.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I thought you were the type of man that was willing to take risks.<eos> I am... but not if it puts people I care about in jeopardy, which is why I'm here to tell you that when Donna offers you her 401(k), you're gonna tell her you don't need it anymore.
No offense, Mr. Specter, but what my daughter does with her money is none of your business.<eos> Well, it became my business when Donna put you so far up on a pedestal that she couldn't smell the bullshit you were dishing out.<eos> It's not bullshit. Yes, it is.<eos> I looked at that deal.<eos> There's no way you're getting the kind of money you need without doing something shady.<eos> Inflating my assets to get a loan isn't shady.<eos> Everybody does it.<eos> That's what everybody thinks until the music stops, which is why if you involve Donna in this deal, so help me God, I will pull every string I have to tie your project up in court for the next 20 years.<eos> I'm just trying to make my way.<eos> All I'm telling you is, you can make it without Donna.
And I'm sorry for what I said.<eos> No.<eos> You were right to say it.<eos> I never should have put you in this position, Donna.<eos> If you want to go back to work for Louis, I'll understand.<eos> No, you shouldn't have put me in that position, but if I was gonna leave you for hiring Mike, the time to do that would have been years ago.<eos> I hope I'm not interrupting your premature celebration.<eos> You better not be reneging on our deal.<eos> Oh, no, I'm gonna honor it.<eos> I just dropped by to serve you with these.
I just dropped by to serve you with these.<eos> You and your partners are hereby subpoenaed to hand over every single document in the entire firm.<eos> No.<eos> No way the judge granted that just because we withdrew our motion to dismiss.<eos> She didn't.<eos> She granted it when a Sheila Sazs from Harvard came forward and said she wrote that anonymous email.<eos> That's right, Mr. Specter.<eos> Your chances of winning this case just took a mighty big turn for the worse.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You never came to see me, so I thought I would come to you and find out why you're so willing to let all those dangerous letters just keep floating around out there.

No, see, I came to see why, when the woman that's been protecting you for so long asks you for a simple gesture of trust, you seem to think that all she's doing is protecting herself.<eos> Because she is protecting herself.<eos> You're goddamn right that's what she's doing, but that's not all she's doing, because from the second that she found out about you, she's had to lie for you, and she still treated you like family,<eos> and it cost her everything. Give me a break.<eos> Until now, it didn't cost her anything.<eos> You better watch yourself.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> It cost her her relationship with me!<eos> You didn't know about that, did you?<eos> So you'll destroy that if I give you mine?
What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that maybe he's trying to show you that there's more to life than Pearson Specter Litt.<eos> I'm not gonna be your attorney on this one.<eos> I think you can find someone better.<eos> No.<eos> I trust you, and there's no way I find someone that I trust more.<eos> Then find me when this is all over, and we'll see if we can put that trust to better use.<eos> Gretchen, whatever it is, it can wait till tomorrow.<eos> This can't wait.<eos> I want to apologize to you.
This can't wait.<eos> I want to apologize to you.<eos> For what? When Jack Soloff nominated Mike Ross for partner,<eos> I know it hurt Harvey a little, because he wanted to be the one to do it, so I called the "ABA Journal" to write an article about Mike.<eos> I wanted to surprise Harvey with it.<eos> You're saying the article that tipped Sheila off was you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because I'm sorry. And if anyone ever asks, I'll deny ever saying this, but... I know you all knew.<eos> And I'm with you.
So he can give Gibbs something she doesn't even have on me yet.<eos> Yes, but to do that, he'd be ruining his whole career.<eos> Which means, even if he remembers you, he's more afraid of you than you are of him.<eos> So calm the hell down.<eos> All right, let's make this quick.<eos> Your Honor, making it quick is exactly what we're asking you to do.<eos> She hasn't handed over her discovery yet.<eos> I'm still building a case, and we haven't even set a date for the trial yet.<eos> And the check's in the mail, and all the other things people say when they don't wanna do what they have to do.<eos> What I have to do is protect the public from the likes of you.
Jessica, our reputation's taking a beating.<eos> We need to rehabilitate it.<eos> That means pro bono, and you know it.<eos> One free case is not going to move the needle, no matter how worthy it is.<eos> I'm not talking about one case.<eos> I'm talking about a series of cases for our clients' most valued charities.<eos> Oh, this better not be another scheme, Jack.<eos> You think this is a move?<eos> Now why would I ever think that after you tried to take my firm from me six times in the last ten minutes?<eos> I did try to take over from you.
Because if that woman is ready to go to trial, she's got a lot more than an e-mail from Louis' girlfriend.<eos> - Rachel Zane.<eos> - Yes?<eos> My name is Anita Gibbs.<eos> I'm the...<eos> Yes, I know who you are.<eos> I'm flattered you came for me personally. But we aren't supposed to talk for another three days, and I don't have my lawyer with me, so...<eos> This isn't a formal interrogation.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> Then I'll tell you what is necessary.

What can I say?<eos> I do my homework.<eos> As do I, Ms. Gibbs, which is why I'm not falling for you pretending to be my friend.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm not your friend.<eos> But I am willing to pull some strings to get the man you love into Columbia Law School.<eos> And if you think that I'm gonna buy that fairy tale, the only strings you're trying to pull are mine.<eos> The only fairy tale here is the one where you believe you get out of this thing unscathed. Okay.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Rachel, I'm just trying to give you your options.
Rachel, I'm just trying to give you your options.<eos> I know my options.<eos> Then you know you have no spousal privilege, which means you're going to have to tell the truth, and put your fiancée away.<eos> Or you're gonna have to plead the Fifth.<eos> Or I can say that he didn't do this.<eos> Perjuring yourself is the same as taking the Fifth, as far as your future is concerned.<eos> What the hell does that mean?<eos> I'm saying that someday you're going to face the character and fitness committee of the Bar, and I seriously doubt they're going to admit somebody who did that.<eos> Are you trying to intimidate a witness?<eos> Because yes, someday I will face that committee, but tomorrow they're going to be hearing about you.
Which is after the trial starts, and that's what I'm goddamn working on.<eos> Harvey, all I'm saying is that when Mike gets worked up about something, he doesn't tend to make the best decisions.<eos> Well, if he doesn't work on the discovery, he's gonna go to jail, so... what do you want me to do?<eos> - I don't know, Harvey.<eos> But you better at least go talk to Anita Gibbs, because Mike gave you a warning loud and clear.<eos> If you don't do something, he will.<eos> Jack, I don't often come outside for my coffee, but when I do is because I'm feeling the need for a little alone time.<eos> Well, I came out here because I knew you wouldn't want anyone hearing what I have to say.<eos> Are you here to tell me you can get the job done?<eos> No, I'm here to tell you if you want me to get it done, you're going to have to open your wallet.

Ms. Scott, there's a Harvey Specter here to see you.<eos> He says it's urgent.<eos> Send him in.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> You have some balls pretending to be Harvey to get in here.<eos> Well, you did call me "Baby Harvey" once.<eos> I don't give a shit what I called you. - Get out!<eos> Now!<eos> - Scottie, Scottie, please.<eos> Listen, I knew you would never agree to see me, and I need to talk to you.
I need someone to bring an action against Anita Gibbs' sister.<eos> Are you insane?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> She's not just coming after me.<eos> - She's coming after my fiancée.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> If I do that, I might as well call the woman up, and tell her that I'm in on your whole bullshit too.<eos> We get someone from your firm...<eos> Not to mention I told Harvey that I never even wanted to hear your name again.<eos> He didn't tell you about that, did he?

No, you said, "on God's green Earth,"<eos> which is exactly what that editorial said.<eos> I remember because I thought,<eos> "What person under 80 uses that phrase?"<eos> Well, looks like I found her.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You sure as hell do, because you planted that goddamn thing.<eos> You have any proof?<eos> No, you don't.<eos> But even if I did plant that, it would only have been because there's no way that one of you did not know what was going on.

What the hell difference does it make what I want?<eos> Jessica, when I left Boston, people said I was a traitor and that I thought I was too good for my own hometown.<eos> Well, it wasn't true.<eos> But I knew the real test for me wasn't making it in my own hometown.<eos> It was making it in the toughest city in the world, and as far as I'm concerned,<eos> You want to be made name partner.<eos> I wanna know if it'll ever even be on the table.<eos> I could say yes to that right now, but how would you know you could trust me?<eos> I have no other choice.<eos> And how do I know I can trust you?
Have you thought about what may happen when this is all over?<eos> You mean if Mike goes to jail.<eos> I mean even if he doesn't.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Even if he is acquitted, there is an excellent chance he will be thrown out of the bar and never be able to practice law again.<eos> It wouldn't matter, because Mike is prepared to never practice law again anyway.<eos> And sometimes people think they're prepared and they're not.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Rachel, Mike is going to have to watch you do what he dreams of doing, and if he's anything like Harvey, he probably thinks he can do it better than you.<eos> And there is a possibility that he might resent you for it.
- Sheila, you take that stand, and you're gonna say things that hurt us, which means Harvey is going to say things that hurt you and I will not be able to handle that.<eos> The truth isn't gonna hurt me, Louis.<eos> Isn't it true, Ms. Sazs, that while you claim no one had unauthorized access to the Harvard file room, there were times you were derelict in your duties?<eos> I've never been derelict in my life.<eos> Then how does that explain the fact that there's a man in this courtroom that had unauthorized access to that very room?<eos> - Louis, please. - Was it because you had a relationship with that man?<eos> A relationship that ultimately failed?<eos> - That's not...<eos> - Relevant? It's more than goddamn relevant!<eos> Because when he broke up with you, you started this vicious rumor to get back at him.
Because if you're thinking it, you're a fool.<eos> You heard her.<eos> She said the fact is, is that I'm not a goddamn lawyer.<eos> Well, the only way to change that fact is for a jury to see me be a goddamn lawyer.<eos> You try that, all they're gonna see is someone going to prison.<eos> It's my call, and I'm making it.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> They found Trevor.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
And the fact is, I'm capable of reciting every element of jurisprudence in the state of New York. And yet despite that, the prosecution is gonna try to convince you that I am a...<eos> Fraud, who not only didn't pass the bar or go to law school, he didn't even graduate college.<eos> There isn't one piece of hard evidence proving that I didn't go to Harvard Law.<eos> There's no record of tuition being paid.<eos> No record of a Boston address.<eos> There isn't even a simple picture in the yearbook.<eos> Let's talk about the yearbook.<eos> As he told you, I'm not in the yearbook.<eos> Where is Mike Ross?<eos> Though what he didn't tell you is that 25 other students are also not in this yearbook.
No, you're not.<eos> You're the one in that chair, so why don't you answer the question, or we can stop this whole thing right now.<eos> There's no record of me living there because I sublet up there when I had my place down here.<eos> So it is possible that a person not have a Boston address without it meaning that they didn't attend Harvard.<eos> Great.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> This witness is excused.<eos> And what, exactly, is your reason for not having an address up there?<eos> Unless you're too afraid to answer my questions.<eos> No, I'm not afraid of you at all.
Great. No more questions, Your Honor.<eos> I don't know if you've noticed this or not, but he's kicking your ass.<eos> And I'm about to kick back.<eos> Are you two discussing something that defense should be made aware of?<eos> Just talking about the Knicks.<eos> Now is the prosecution ready to call their first witness?<eos> The prosecution's first witness is this affidavit from every single member of the defendant's supposed graduating class.<eos> Objection, Your Honor.<eos> I haven't seen that.<eos> Well, then let me read it to you.
"We never heard of him.<eos> "And it makes us sick that he's taking the good name "of Harvard Law School and throwing it down the toilet.<eos> Please find him guilty on all counts."<eos> Your Honor, I move to strike that document right now.<eos> On what grounds?<eos> On the grounds that it's completely fabricated.<eos> Where's your proof?<eos> Besides the fact that I actually went to Harvard, there's no way you could have contacted all of those people since last night.<eos> Then I suggest you call every one of these people and put them on the stand.<eos> But when you do, every single one of them is gonna look you in the eye and say, "Who the hell are you?"
And Harvey wasn't gonna tell me because he's playing dirty.<eos> He's not your enemy, Mike.<eos> He's just doing what he thinks is best.<eos> Then I'm gonna do what I think is best.<eos> And what exactly is that?<eos> Donna, he may not be my enemy, and you may not be my enemy, but as long as we're in this trial run, I'm not trusting you with anything.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> Jessica Pearson, I wasn't aware we had an appointment today.<eos> We don't.<eos> I just stopped by to give you this restraining order, preventing you from contacting Louis Litt without his attorney present.
Who were the witnesses?<eos> And what goddamn time was it?<eos> Your Honor, get him off of her! - Harvey...<eos> - Tell me right now.<eos> Let the witness answer.<eos> The dress was white.<eos> And the cake was vanilla with a buttercream frosting.<eos> It was a small ceremony at around 10:00 p.m.<eos> And I remember the man who married us like it was yesterday because it was the most special day of my life.<eos> And when you came up with this story, did Mr. Ross at least give you the courtesy of letting you make up your own memories of your supposedly sacred day?
Then why won't you do what you have to do for me?<eos> Because if I did that, it would open me up to perjury.<eos> If Mike gets convicted, what does it matter if you perjure yourself?<eos> Both of you be quiet.<eos> Look who's coming.<eos> Look who it is.<eos> The Three Musketeers.<eos> And we happen to be in the middle of a meeting.<eos> That's okay;<eos> I just dropped by to let you know it looks like the trial's been moved up till tomorrow.
What the hell did you do?<eos> I went to the judge, and I said, "Your Honor,<eos> "I'd like to start this thing before every single witness I have disappears."<eos> No way she granted this without us present.<eos> Oh, you can fight it, if you want.<eos> We'll wait for Ms. Sazs to finish her trip.<eos> Oh, Mr. Litt seems upset about that.<eos> Looks like the wedge I'm driving between you is starting to work.<eos> Your wedge hasn't done shit.<eos> And I'm gonna tell you something else.
Yes, we shared an apartment at 5307 Huntington Boulevard in Brooklyn.<eos> And how exactly did he pay his rent?<eos> He worked as a bike messenger and made money on the side taking the LSATs for people.<eos> Oh, wait, I'm confused.<eos> Why would he have to resort to that if he were a college graduate?<eos> Because he wasn't a college graduate.<eos> What?<eos> You mean he never graduated from college?<eos> No, he was kicked out of college for cheating on a test.<eos> Well, isn't it possible that while he was living with you, he went back to school and completed his degree?
Yes.<eos> One last question, Mr. Evans.<eos> Is it at all possible that Mike Ross ever attended Harvard Law School?<eos> Not unless they had a satellite campus at 5307 Huntington Boulevard in Brooklyn.<eos> No more questions, Your Honor.<eos> Given that you smoked all this pot, Mr. Evans, isn't it possible that if Mike Ross commuted one day a week to Harvard Law that you might not remember that?<eos> I'd remember.<eos> Yeah, maybe you would, but you'd lie through your teeth about it anyway, wouldn't you?<eos> Objection.<eos> Mr. Evans, isn't it true that you're a long-time drug dealer and your testimony today is only happening because you signed a deal with Ms. Gibbs giving you immunity?
How did you know he'd testify?<eos> I didn't until just now.<eos> Well, when I first met Mike, I thought,<eos> "Who is this asshole who only ever shows up for tests?"<eos> Cockiest son of a bitch I ever saw.<eos> But then I really got to know Mike when we were arguing over an ethics question in Professor Gerard's class.<eos> Should a lawyer who's crossed a line be given a second chance?<eos> I didn't think so, but Mike did, and that's when I realized that Mike Ross has more integrity and compassion in his little finger than any other lawyer I've ever met.<eos> And if I was on trial for my life, there's no one I'd rather have on my side than my fellow Harvard alum Mike Ross.<eos> Just so we're 100% clear, was Mike Ross a student at Harvard Law School with you?

Ms. Gibbs, I'll give you 24 hours to prepare for cross.
(HARVEY READING)<eos> CLIFFORD: I don't owe Harvey shit.<eos> He may have gotten me out, but he and Cameron put me there in the first place.<eos> You're right. You don't owe Harvey. But you do owe me.<eos> Because I didn't have anything to do with putting you in there, but I broke the law to get you out.<eos> I came here to compliment you on getting rid of Sheila Sazs.<eos> If she's not back by the start of trial, I'm going to assume that you wanna be brought up on charges.

Hi. My name's Mike Ross.<eos> I'm a lawyer at Pearson Specter Litt and I was...<eos> I know who you are.<eos> And I know what you're doing here.<eos> You've come to get Clifford to testify for you. But I'm afraid he's not going to.<eos> Please, ma'am. I promise you the DA cannot reopen his case.<eos> I'm not talking about the District Attorney.<eos> My son's dead, Mr. Ross.<eos> What?<eos> Clifford was shot and killed three weeks ago. So... I'm sorry, he can't help you.
Because I... lam bullshit.<eos> You see, the truth is, is that I am guilty of being a fraud.<eos> My whole life, I have wanted to be a lawyer so that I could help people like Clifford Danner.<eos> People who have no one else to fight for them.<eos> No one who believes in them.<eos> But instead, all I've done as a lawyer is work night and day to put money into the hands of rich people.<eos> I was given a gift and I wasted it. And I'm ashamed of myself.<eos> And... And... And as the final insult,<eos> I am so sorry, Gloria.<eos> And all I can say is that I promise you, whether these people find me innocent or not, I am going to spend the rest of my life fighting for the Clifford Danners of this world.
And I always will be.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, it's an interesting thing, really, how criminals can play with our emotions.<eos> Mike Ross is articulate and persuasive and passionate, and listening to his closing argument, I almost want to let him go myself. Except for one thing.<eos> He's a liar.<eos> He didn't commute to Harvard one clay a week as he so laughably claims.<eos> He didn't go to college.<eos> There is no paper record of his enrollment. No applications to law school. No picture in the yearbook.<eos> Except for that one indebted friend with a lot to lose.<eos> And if you believe his testimony, I've got a bridge over Brooklyn I'd like to sell you.
When Mike wanted to represent himself,<eos> Gibbs jumped out of her chair saying that we were trying to get a mistrial.<eos> Then she demanded we waive our rights to one completely.<eos> And the only reason she'd do that is because she doesn't have authorization to try this case again.<eos> Which means a mistrial isn't just kicking the can down the road.<eos> No, it's blowing it to kingdom come.<eos> The only problem is, we don't have grounds for a mistrial.<eos> Well, then, you better go out and find some.<eos> And you better do it before that jury comes back.<eos> DIAZ: That's what I'm trying to tell you.

The judge does.<eos> And you're entitled to one automatically if this is the first time your attorney didn't show.
Yeah, well, I'm making it my concern since I don't like watching prosecutors take advantage of unrepresented defendants.<eos> All I'm doing is offering the man a deal.<eos> I'm not taking advantage.<eos> That is bullshit.<eos> You know full well his lawyer didn't tell him to ask you for a continuance, he told him to ask the judge for one.<eos> Now, you're going to try and bully him into three and half years for what sounds to me like a simple misdemeanor theft.<eos> You don't know shit about this case.<eos> Well, I'm about to.<eos> Hand over the case file.<eos> I don't have to give you anything.
Yes, they're deliberating on his fate right now.<eos> I don't give a shit if they're deliberating. ls he a fake or not?<eos> You saw what he just did.<eos> And he's about to cut you a deal from four years behind bars to maybe a few months.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> What did he say?<eos> He's too pissed off to make a deal right now. But trust me, he'll calm down and then he will.<eos> Mike, where are you going?<eos> To go try and make a deal of my own.<eos> You ran out of there so fast, I didn't get a chance to talk to you.
To go try and make a deal of my own.<eos> You ran out of there so fast, I didn't get a chance to talk to you.<eos> What exactly do you want, Mr. Ross?<eos> I want to make a deal.<eos> You're finally ready to turn on Mr. Specter?<eos> No. But I am ready to plead guilty and never practice law again. If you agree to not go after any of the partners at Pearson Specter.<eos> That's the same bullshit your boss said to me when I first met him.<eos> You're done practicing, so I should just let you get away with it?<eos> Now, why would I listen to you now if I didn't listen to him then?<eos> Because you've got it written all over your face.

No. It says I'm not willing to take a chance on 12 complete strangers.<eos> It says you don't have faith in him.<eos> Donna, you don't know what you're saying.<eos> Don't I? I know I'm not a lawyer, but isn't it true that if Mike gets found innocent, there's no double jeopardy? But if a mistrial happens, they might come after him again one day.<eos> Yes, Donna, that is true. But Harvey and I are banking that never happens.<eos> And what if it does?<eos> Then, I'm sorry. But the truth is, Mike Ross is the reason why we're in this mess in the first place. And if it's a choice between his peace of mind clown the road and mine today,<eos> Now, is that all?<eos> Louis Litt. What a coincidence. I was just about to call your office, say I was your cousin, and ask if you'd decided to take me up on my offer.<eos> Before I give you an answer, I want to know if I give you proof that Harvey knew about Mike, will you give me immunity?

I was just about to call your office, say I was your cousin, and ask if you'd decided to take me up on my offer.<eos> Before I give you an answer, I want to know if I give you proof that Harvey knew about Mike, will you give me immunity?<eos> Well, that depends.<eos> What do you have?<eos> What do you mean, what do I have?<eos> Well, that's not good enough.<eos> Well, then, what the hell did you come to me for?<eos> Because I was expecting something more than the testimony of a man who's saving his own ass, which gets me nothing.<eos> Nothing?<eos> I'd be giving you my word.
You said you were giving me a chance to save face. But I let you get off with no punishment, as far as my career goes,<eos> I might as well have let them find you innocent.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You plead guilty, do two years in prison, and I won't go after any of your friends.<eos> There's no way I agree to prison time for a crime I didn't commit.<eos> We're not in the courtroom right now, Mike. So, let's cut the bullshit.<eos> We both know you did this.<eos> So, if you don't want to pay, then you take me up on my original offer.<eos> You do no time, and all I need in return is one name partner at your firm.<eos> And I told you that's never going to happen.
I'm just asking you to have faith in yourself.<eos> Okay, I will.<eos> Where the hell were you?<eos> You mean why I wasn't at the café?<eos> I was just coming to the conclusion that you could take that threat and shove it up your ass.<eos> You think I'm bluffing you?<eos> I don't give a shit whether you're bluffing or not.<eos> It made me sick to let Mike Ross back me into a corner.<eos> I'm not letting that happen again.<eos> I don't think you understand what's going to happen to you when I call Anita Gibbs tomorrow morning.
She says she needs to know whether you found that old mixtape of hers.<eos> Tell her I didn't.<eos> Tell her it must have gotten thrown out and to never ask me about it again.<eos> Good.<eos> What do you mean, "Good"?<eos> I've been wanting to tell Anita Gibbs to go to hell since this whole thing started.<eos> Mr. Ross, I'd like to make your client an offer.<eos> We're listening.<eos> We don't want you, Mr. Diaz.<eos> You said you were just driving the truck and I believe you.
DIAZ:<eos> Holy shit. No jail time.<eos> ALEXANDER:<eos> No jail time. Okay, that's enough.<eos> I need a moment with my client.<eos> No, I don't need a moment. I'll take it.<eos> Mr. Diaz, listen to me.<eos> Testifying against your friends may not seem like a big deal right now, but it's something you are going to have to live with for the rest of your life.<eos> I don't owe them anything. And if I can get myself out, that's what I'm going to do.<eos> He's only offering you this because he doesn't have a case against you.
I don't think you understand.<eos> I'm going to a white-collar prison.<eos> There's no such thing as a white-collar prison once they close those doors.<eos> You need to hear me.<eos> Gloria, look, I know that you are trying to help, but I took responsibility for what I did, and I'm gonna live with it.<eos> But right now, I need to go spend time with the woman I love and make things right, so I'm sorry, but you have to excuse me.<eos> Robert, I got your message.<eos> I rushed right over.<eos> What happened to Rachel?<eos> I'll tell you what happened.

I made a decision, and I...<eos> I can't go back in time and change it.<eos> But we are here right now, all right?<eos> We have... we have three days left.<eos> I'm gonna have to take one of those days for myself...<eos> Because you promised me that you would have faith in yourself.<eos> And you didn't.<eos> You remember me?<eos> How could I not?<eos> I listened to you for the better part of two weeks.
I listened to you for the better part of two weeks.<eos> Then I'll get right to it.<eos> I need a favor.<eos> You got a truck needs fixing?<eos> I want to know what that verdict was gonna be.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> It makes all the difference in the world.<eos> Then I'll tell you, 'cause I've been dying to tell somebody, 'cause it was "12 Angry Men" in there, and I was the one.
I tried to talk to Michael, but he wouldn't listen.<eos> Talk to him about what?<eos> About what's gonna happen to him inside that prison.<eos> Mrs. Danner, I appreciate you coming down here, but I can't talk about this right now.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You're gonna listen to what I have to say, because I saw what prison did to my son, Mr. Specter.<eos> Michael needs to know what his first day is gonna be like, who to make friends with, what guards to stay away from, because it's the guards that are the worst.<eos> You think I don't know all that?<eos> Then do something to toughen up that boy!<eos> I told you, I can't talk about this right now.
He said he was goddamn innocent.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> He's going away for nothing.<eos> No, Donna, he's not going away at all.<eos> What do you need me to do?<eos> I need you to get me everything we have on that trial, because I'm gonna figure out a way to invalidate that goddamn deal.<eos> Jessica, do you have a minute?<eos> I'm really busy right now, Jack.<eos> I'm afraid this can't wait.<eos> I'm officially giving you my letter of resignation.

We're already destroyed.
You just don't want to accept it.<eos> No, this is a setback.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Jack.<eos> I think you're forgetting about that folder you gave me, the one with the little legal indiscretion<eos> Let's not soft-pedal it, Jessica.<eos> It wasn't an indiscretion.<eos> It was a flat-out crime.<eos> And the problem with you using it is, you'll be announcing to the world yet another crime happened under your watch, and you did nothing to stop it.<eos> And whatever clients were willing to stay with you before won't be willing to anymore.
You don't have a noncompete with Jack Soloff or anyone else.<eos> I heard you tried that empty threat with Louis, but it's not gonna work with me.<eos> If it is empty, then so is your morals clause and your bylaws, which states that if a named partner participates in a crime, any partner is free to go.<eos> And conspiracy to commit fraud is a goddamn crime.<eos> You can't prove we knew about Mike Ross.<eos> Well, let me suggest that you ask Louis Litt about his conversation with Katrina Bennett this morning.<eos> I got you, Jessica, and if you want to come after me for hiring Jack, or anyone for hiring anyone, you may not go to jail, but the world is gonna know what you did.<eos> Why are you doing this, Robert?<eos> I don't give a shit about you hiring a fraud, Jessica, but you never came to me with it once he started dating Rachel.<eos> How could I have known I could have trusted you not to come after my firm?

I'm not here to see Robert. I'm here to see you.<eos> Well, I'd rather you go.<eos> Laura, please.<eos> Please what, Michael?<eos> Robert and I were ready to embrace the man who was going to marry our daughter, and it turns out, that man is a liar.<eos> And now you're here to get me to convince my husband to go to your wedding?<eos> It's not just my wedding.<eos> It's also Rachel's.<eos> And I can talk to Robert until I'm blue in the face.<eos> He will never forgive you.
I'd be honored, Michael.<eos> Thank you, Father.<eos> Michael, since you're not inviting many people, we don't have to do it in here.<eos> We could always do it in the small chapel.<eos> I appreciate that, Father, but my mom and dad weren't married in the small chapel.<eos> Okay, you're here.<eos> What's so important I had to reschedule an arraignment to meet with you?<eos> Because that arraignment wasn't gonna lead to you putting corporate murderers behind bars.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You got a hold of some incriminating documents, and you want me to prosecute these people in exchange for keeping Mike Ross out of jail.
Because that arraignment wasn't gonna lead to you putting corporate murderers behind bars.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You got a hold of some incriminating documents, and you want me to prosecute these people in exchange for keeping Mike Ross out of jail.<eos> Murder for fraud, straight up.<eos> Not interested.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Compared to this, what Mike Ross did barely constitutes spitting on a sidewalk.<eos> I know that.<eos> Then what the hell is wrong with you?<eos> I'll tell you what's wrong with me.
Listen to me.<eos> Compared to this, what Mike Ross did barely constitutes spitting on a sidewalk.<eos> I know that.<eos> Then what the hell is wrong with you?<eos> I'll tell you what's wrong with me.<eos> You.<eos> You've been bending the rules since the day you were born, and I'm not letting you get away with it anymore.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You bent rules up and down this entire case.<eos> Except the difference between you and me is, I'm bending them to get justice.
I got to go.<eos> I got to ask Rachel to marry me.<eos> I thought you were already getting married.<eos> There's something I got to tell her first.<eos> You come here to gloat?<eos> Because tonight is not the night.<eos> No, Robert.<eos> I came here to make peace.<eos> You were right.<eos> I should have come to you, and I'm sorry I didn't, and I will regret that for the rest of my life.

No.<eos> Just one more.<eos> 24 hours.<eos> That depends on the locals.<eos> I'll try.<eos> But mercy has a different meaning out here.<eos> This will all be over soon.<eos> Afternoon, fellow survivors.<eos> There's no need for your weapons.<eos> We mean you no harm.
Cleanup on aisle nine.<eos> Don't worry about that. Just a little recycling.<eos> As I was saying.<eos> It's imperative for your sakes, and for humanity's, that I speak with Doctor Teller.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Really?<eos> Was he mercied in the last 24 hours? Because<eos> I have this drone photo showing him standing right about where you are now.<eos> Taken yesterday.<eos> Does this belong to any of you?
And go where?<eos> This is all we have left.<eos> Can you help us?<eos> I'm not sure how much help we can be.<eos> I mean we're actually in the middle of some very urgent matters.<eos> Lives are at stake for us too.<eos> We can't take on these men alone.<eos> We don't have the weapons or the skills.<eos> But you do.<eos> I know you have other priorities But we can help you too.
Spartacus is one of my favorite movies.<eos> You all remember how it turns out?<eos> Spartacus and all of his clones are crucified.<eos> Upside down.<eos> Got to admit, the Romans did have style.<eos> Why don't you let these people be?<eos> And you are?<eos> Doctor Teller.<eos> All right.<eos> If that's how you want to play this, I'll give you a little more time to think through the consequences of cooperating.
How secure is your perimeter?<eos> Chain link and barbwire mostly.<eos> It keeps the Zs out.<eos> But I'm not too sure about humans.<eos> We can scavenge the sheet metal off the shelters and build a more defensible barricade.<eos> Still time to make a run for it.<eos> They'd only catch us out in the open.<eos> At this point we stay and fight.<eos> Use home court advantage.<eos> Thank you.
Yeah, well don't thank us yet.<eos> There's at least four men that we've seen.<eos> They're heavily armed.<eos> That's what I don't understand.<eos> Why haven't they just come in, taken you hostage, killed you one by one?<eos> He said the people he worked for wanted to show mercy.<eos> He's got a funny way of showing it.<eos> And who are these people he works for?<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> What do they want with you?
Yes.<eos> She wants you to mercy her.<eos> How did you know my name? She told me.<eos> I can hear what she's thinking.<eos> What all of them are thinking.<eos> Who is she?<eos> My wife.<eos> Sarah.<eos> Her name is Sarah.<eos> She's asking you a question.
You deserve it.<eos> How's it going back there? It's going.<eos> You should probably get there.<eos> Find yourself a nice spot outside the perimeter.<eos> So we can set up a crossfire. What about you?<eos> I'll be along in a bit.<eos> I'm going to check around the perimeter to make sure<eos> The Man doesn't come back early.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> If you so much as move, I'll shoot you in the spine and leave you for the zombies. I said damn it I'll shoot!
If you so much as move, I'll shoot you in the spine and leave you for the zombies. I said damn it I'll shoot!<eos> You know that's completely up to them, right?<eos> You just make sure you have the transport standing by and ready for x-fill.<eos> This will all be over soon.<eos> Except for you.<eos> You are not going anywhere.<eos> You know they're gonna kill you.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Look.<eos> The doctor will go with you.
I like the paint job.<eos> Cut the crap, Mister Clean.<eos> If you hurt our friend, there will be consequences. I'm not interested in her.<eos> She's not on my list.<eos> Doctor Teller is on my list.<eos> Bring him to me, nobody gets hurt.<eos> He is here, isn't he? He's here.<eos> Finally.<eos> We're making progress.<eos> Bring me the doctor, and I'll give you Spartacus.
Oh god.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> When will this end?<eos> She's saying you can end it now.<eos> I love you.<eos> You need to mercy her.<eos> Have mercy.<eos> Stay with Lucy.<eos> What is your problem?<eos> I got no problem with you.
She's saying you can end it now.<eos> I love you.<eos> You need to mercy her.<eos> Have mercy.<eos> Stay with Lucy.<eos> What is your problem?<eos> I got no problem with you.<eos> You're not on my list.<eos> It's him I want.<eos> I'm not going anywhere with you.
Previously, on "Blindspot"...<eos> Chief Inspector Fischer.<eos> This can't be good.<eos> I'm opening an inquiry into the death of David Wagner.<eos> You're never gonna be the head of the NYO.<eos> You think I don't know you've been campaigning internally?<eos> When was the first time you removed classified documents from the FBI's office?<eos> And were you aware at the time that you were breaking federal law?
Orion is where you died.<eos> It was an operation.<eos> Things went sideways, you went off the grid.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Orion is why you're here.<eos> Why we're all here.<eos> But I can't tell you more.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You can't trust them.<eos> They trust you, so I trust you.
How did you not work this out before?<eos> This is the first I'm hearing of this, - Your Honor.<eos> - Well, it shouldn't be.<eos> If your client truly has that name, it is vital to national security.<eos> - We'll need a deal on the table before my client says anything further.<eos> You've got 15 minutes.<eos> Make it happen.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> I'm your attorney, you blindside me with this?<eos> Bluffing is not going to get you...
- We'll need a deal on the table before my client says anything further.<eos> You've got 15 minutes.<eos> Make it happen.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> I'm your attorney, you blindside me with this?<eos> Bluffing is not going to get you...<eos> It's not a bluff.<eos> I couldn't risk the name getting out before I saw the judge.<eos> You really have a name?<eos> Yes, on my children's lives, I swear to you, I have the name.
She works for a firm the Russian embassy keeps on retainer.<eos> She was a fixer.<eos> Olivia was obviously a problem for someone in the Russian embassy.<eos> - Maria fixed it.<eos> - He's right.<eos> So how do we prove it?<eos> If you want to directly tie the embassy to criminal activity, you're gonna need someone from inside.<eos> We believe Russian diplomats are running an illegal smuggling ring.<eos> But every time I get close, they shut down and switch things up. - Now I know why...<eos> - Uh, Sloane, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
He's been angling for my job for the better part of a year.<eos> He's gonna use this investigation to embarrass us and push me out.<eos> The last thing that we need is that guy in charge.<eos> All right, so we got to find the Russian source before he does.<eos> Patterson, clear those screens.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - No, please. Don't let me stop you.<eos> Just because you're under investigation as well doesn't mean you shouldn't fumble about and see what you can find.<eos> Wait, why are we under investigation?<eos> Oh, he didn't tell you?
Patterson, clear those screens.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - No, please. Don't let me stop you.<eos> Just because you're under investigation as well doesn't mean you shouldn't fumble about and see what you can find.<eos> Wait, why are we under investigation?<eos> Oh, he didn't tell you?<eos> The FBI's New York office has been compromised.<eos> I'm here to spearhead the investigation and root out the traitor.<eos> You knew about this?<eos> Well... maybe Special Agent Weller had good reason not to trust you.
Did you walk Ms. Jane Doe to her door?<eos> No.<eos> So you can't confirm that she even went home.<eos> Hang on, what I'm telling you...<eos> I'm just trying to establish a timeline.<eos> Agent Patterson told me she saw Jane go home with her detail.<eos> You've just confirmed she subsequently met you later that night without her detail, after which she left, totally unaccounted for, on the last night Tom Carter was seen alive.<eos> The only person who knows where Jane really was that night is Jane.<eos> So, stop me if I'm getting any of this wrong.<eos> Tom Carter didn't trust you.
You didn't account for the window reflections, Ms. Doe.<eos> I couldn't sleep, so I went for a run.<eos> You're lying.<eos> You didn't go home after kissing Weller.<eos> You went after Carter, because he found out your secret.<eos> And then you killed him.<eos> No, you're wrong.<eos> I am not a mole.<eos> You're caught, Ms. Doe.<eos> I'm telling you the truth, I didn't kill Carter.
Do it again.<eos> And then sent back to the United States to infiltrate the FBI.<eos> Reade suspected it.<eos> But Carter proved it.<eos> And he and Agent Patterson's boyfriend were murdered because of it.<eos> You actually spoke Russian to a fellow Russian spy in this very room.<eos> Olivia Delidio recognized you.<eos> But before she could name you, your handlers had her killed.<eos> It's over, Jane Doe.<eos> Now, isn't part of you a little relieved?
Arrest her for what?<eos> Your evidence is circumstantial.<eos> No body, no weapon...<eos> all you've got is a photo.<eos> You're trying to twist the rest into a narrative you can't prove.<eos> Why can't you see what's right in front of your eyes, Agent Weller?<eos> I've got a guy in Patterson's lab that can ID the Russian source.<eos> What "guy"?<eos> Roman Kozar, a driver that Agent Sloane has turned in the Russian embassy.<eos> Well, have you considered the fact that this Roman Kozar might just tell you anything you want to hear in order to get out of whatever charge you apparently have against him?
They're solving crimes, not enabling them.<eos> Jane is not the mole.<eos> Then why did Roman ID her?<eos> You're a Russian counterintelligence agent.<eos> You've had years to bust this spy ring.<eos> You didn't, why?<eos> You're protecting them.<eos> Roman's your guy.<eos> He ID'd Jane because you told him to.<eos> I have been here all day trying to help you.
- Very soon, she promised.<eos> There's no parking space.<eos> You'll have to park outside.<eos> We'll do without.<eos> We're selling the car to pay the deposit.<eos> - Who said anything about money?<eos> - Even so. Hello, Mr. Salimi.<eos> Mr. Shahnazari, the best neighbor ever.<eos> How are you?<eos> Pleased to meet you.
Who's there?<eos> Come up.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello, sir.<eos> How are you?<eos> Is it here for the move? Majid sent me.<eos> Yes, come in.<eos> He's not with you?<eos> He's busy. He sent me instead.<eos> After you.
If he's nearby, I'll go and get him.<eos> Who? Your son-in-law.<eos> They've gone shopping for the wedding.<eos> There's no janitor?<eos> No, it's empty.<eos> Some walls collapsed. We had to evacuate.<eos> It's not going to fall on our heads?<eos> Let's look and see if we need any help.<eos> Sir?<eos> Have a seat, I need to talk to you.
Some walls collapsed. We had to evacuate.<eos> It's not going to fall on our heads?<eos> Let's look and see if we need any help.<eos> Sir?<eos> Have a seat, I need to talk to you.<eos> Listen, it's not my job.<eos> Majid said you insisted, and I agreed to come.<eos> Give me whatever you like.<eos> It's not that.<eos> Sit down, I need to tell you something.
I prayed all the way to hear his voice again.<eos> Thanks be to God.<eos> I told you not to go.<eos> I don't want you working anymore.<eos> Don't work anymore.<eos> You said, "It's for Majid, I'll be back soon. "<eos> Now look.<eos> You should thank these people for helping him.<eos> He was lucky.<eos> We don't know how to thank you.
You've given me back my life.<eos> He's everything to me.<eos> Stop it, Mom.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Have you got everything?<eos> Your phone?<eos> The car keys.<eos> - And his glasses, where are they?<eos> - I've got them. Come, I'll give them to you.
- And his glasses, where are they?<eos> - I've got them. Come, I'll give them to you.<eos> - I'll take them.<eos> - Go on.<eos> He has to come himself.<eos> We have an account to settle.<eos> Come.<eos> What account?<eos> You saved his life.<eos> We gave you so much trouble you don't owe us anything.
I am trained in extraction techniques, so...<eos> Let me talk to them.<eos> I'll get the 411.<eos> No!<eos> No cowboy shit.<eos> The worst reaction is an overreaction.<eos> I am sure Captain Piscatella would agree with me... were he here.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Exactly as you say, sir.<eos> I assure you no one is taking this lightly, but it is an unprecedented situation that requires a measured response.
- Warren. - Hmm?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Leave that.<eos> What are they talking about?<eos> Takin'... taking Suzanne away.<eos> She what?<eos> Hold up.<eos> What's this about?<eos> I'll tell you later.
- You gotta puke? - No.<eos> - Are you really good at being in denial? - Yeah.<eos> Joe.<eos> There are no words, huh?<eos> Who does such a thing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's terrible.<eos> Have you met Josh?<eos> Mr. Caputo, nice to meet you.<eos> Josh will help you review everything you know, make sure it matches with our records.

No idea.<eos> Well... it has to do with the body we dug up in the garden.<eos> There's a...<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> So, this is news to you?<eos> I'm shocked.<eos> Who is she?<eos> How do you know it's a she? Is it?<eos> No.<eos> Captain... I would love to help you, but I'm not in the mood for games.
I should know.<eos> My mom sent me to gay conversion camp.<eos> Amazing that you ended up in minimum.<eos> The Russian mob must've sprung for one hell of a lawyer.<eos> You don't know a thing about me.<eos> I know enough to send you to Max.<eos> I know you won't be runnin' the kitchen down the hill.<eos> I guarantee you that.<eos> But if you tell me who else was involved... maybe I can make things a little more comfortable for you.<eos> You were better at the bad cop.
You were never Taylor Shaw.<eos> - Who the hell are you?<eos> - I don't know, but...<eos> Get on your knees, put your hands on your head.<eos> Jane Doe, you're under arrest.<eos> _<eos> Okay, let's try this again.<eos> Why Kurt Weller?<eos> You know, you've been here for three months.<eos> How much longer are you gonna make us do this to you, Jane?
Nothing.<eos> Something. What?<eos> It's just a little anticlimactic, don't you think?<eos> We spent an entire week tracking down a counterfeiter.<eos> - It was a solid bust.<eos> - We miss working the tattoos.<eos> Assistant Director Weller?<eos> My name is Naz Kamal.<eos> I work for the NSA.<eos> I need to speak with you and your team immediately.
It monitors even the smallest contractions in the veins, heart, and brain.<eos> It's 100% accurate, and it makes a polygraph look like a mood ring.<eos> Then why do we use a polygraph?<eos> Because... we're not allowed to inject our subjects with substantial doses of radioactive material.<eos> It's not exactly legal.<eos> Hello, Jane.<eos> My name is Naz.<eos> I need you to be completely honest with me.<eos> That's the only way that this is going to work.<eos> What makes you think I'll tell you anything?

I think it's fair to categorize you as resourceful.<eos> You could be halfway around the world right now, but instead, you chose to hide in Camden, New Jersey, two hours away from here.<eos> You didn't run 'cause you're not finished.<eos> You want to find them.<eos> Well, so do I.<eos> It'll be nearly impossible to keep the CIA from finding out that we've recaptured you.<eos> And if they do take you back into custody... they'll keep you somewhere that you will never break out of.<eos> Give me a reason to hold them off.<eos> You work with us, earn your freedom.<eos> Help us bring down the people who put you here.
He showed me a video.<eos> It was a recording I made for myself before they erased my memory.<eos> You did this to yourself.<eos> And did you believe them?<eos> That you did this to yourself?<eos> Yes.<eos> I remembered Oscar.<eos> We...<eos> We were engaged before all of this.<eos> What did Oscar want you to do?
Stop... stalling and take me to Shepherd... where is he?<eos> Shepherd? You won't make it to the med cache.<eos> We gotta get you to the hospital.<eos> And tell them what?<eos> I have a way with words.<eos> Before Mayfair disap...<eos> Before she... died... uh, she left us...<eos> She left us a drive with a bunch of encrypted files.<eos> Daylight was an illegal NSA program.<eos> But I'm guessing we don't have to fill you in on that.
Fuck.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Down is worse.<eos> Mr. Caputo. Jesus Christ, Bayley!<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> - I misjudged the approach.<eos> But, uh...<eos> I need to talk to you about something.
I'm not buyin' it.<eos> We could try.<eos> We could be like old people who talk about articles, and eat soup, and hold hands on the slow stroll to the ass doctor for colonoscopies.<eos> Deal.<eos> --Humphrey, right?<eos> I just call him Humps.<eos> It's more fun that way.<eos> What the fuck was that about last night?<eos> The way I understand it, sir, a body was found--<eos> An inmate is in medical because of a fight you instigated.
It still works, but it ain't pretty.<eos> And don't make my ass point out the metaphor.<eos> I am working on it.<eos> These things take time, okay?<eos> Hey, uh, let me get that for you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Bayley.<eos> A word.<eos> Sir, you didn't tell anyone it was me who told you, right?
Once again, I have a favor to ask.<eos> I know, I ask and I ask, and here I am again.<eos> Think of me as your prison psoriasis.<eos> Can I take a nap in here, Sam? Please?<eos> That fucking Piscatella won't let me sleep and my vision is getting blurry.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Sam, what's wrong?<eos> Red... when did you get here?<eos> Look at me.<eos> I don't know what's going on with you, but you need to get yourself together.
This is inhumane.<eos> Prison wasn't built on humanity, inmate.<eos> Listen up!<eos> Things have been pretty lax around here, if you ask me.<eos> So lax, in fact, that one of my men was murdered on prison property by one of you.<eos> It seems that, somewhere along the way, everyone around here forgot the only thing that matters.<eos> You're criminals, and you deserve nothing.<eos> And if I have to make an example out of each and every one of you to get this place back in order... well, that will be my pleasure.<eos> - Get to work.<eos> -What the fuck is wrong with you?
Where are the police?<eos> Oh, I haven't called the police.<eos> That's the last thing on the list.<eos> Everyone back to their bunks, check.<eos> Total lockdown.<eos> All communication on blackout, check.<eos> Phones are cut off, TVs are disabled.<eos> And my guys have been told to brief the other COs on the story.<eos> What story?<eos> What I was telling you before you interrupted me.
What I was telling you before you interrupted me.<eos> -She was extremely violent.<eos> We start-- -Piscatella, go home.<eos> All due respect... there was an insurrection in this prison tonight--<eos> There was a peaceful protest in this prison tonight that became fatal when the men under your command got involved.<eos> Someone died on your watch, Captain.<eos> --A human being.<eos> You better believe we're gonna look into it.<eos> And we're gonna be hearing many stories.<eos> Not just the story you're telling, but many stories, including the one about why you came to Litchfield in the first place from the men's high security facility.
Smokin' off my stash.<eos> You used to work at Dave and Busters? -Mmm-hmm.<eos> -Damn. -Can you get me free games?<eos> -Hell, no!<eos> Yeah, my manager, Carl, is serious as fuck.<eos> - Man would charge you for a ice cube.<eos> - To one amazing night.<eos> To New York City, baby.<eos> In five, four, three, two...<eos> As many of you are aware... we suffered a terrible tragedy here at the Litchfield Correctional Camp yesterday.
What I mean to say is, everyone's a stranger at first.<eos> But we could stop being strangers to one another.<eos> Do you want to give me your cell number?<eos> - Yes, naturally, excellent.<eos> The only thing is, I don't have a cell.<eos> Is that still a thing nowadays?<eos> - Yes, but I'm not weird,<eos> I just don't like talking while walking.<eos> But you can call me at the newsroom.<eos> I'll write down the... number for you. Mark... Zimmermann.
Well, don't you? Sit down, please sit down.<eos> - Thank you<eos> What's new?<eos> - Well... for me the day depends on how things go here.<eos> I thought so after I applied too much pressure last time.<eos> The muse needs to be coaxed, right?<eos> You have all the time in the world.<eos> Another whole week.<eos> Pressure kills creativity, right?<eos> I'll tell you something, there are more important things in life:
- I interview her tomorrow. You'll have it the day after.<eos> Good.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - And there's that, too?<eos> - I'll handle it.<eos> I want to be yours... Yours and just yours... - Cut!<eos> Wonderful, Henriette!<eos> I said the lights...<eos> - Take five! Right. - What the...<eos> What happened to you?
Ah, yes. These things are gonna kill me.<eos> But that's what I get for marrying a saint.<eos> What would I do without you?<eos> The law is very clear.<eos> Anyone who hinders or delays The discovery of Goodman Wolf's whereabouts is guilty of harboring a fugitive.<eos> Detective, if we knew where my son was, we would insist he turn himself in.<eos> Good. 'Cause it doesn't get any better for him.<eos> Fugitive warrants don't expire ever.<eos> Until he comes back to stand trial, he will be considered a wanted criminal.<eos> Listen, did it ever occur to you that we are missing our son? We've lost our son. We don't know if he's alive.
And you just got a job on a network television show.<eos> It's an animated piece of shit, Jules.<eos> Have you seen it? The point is you're going somewhere, and so am I.<eos> Not getting there as fast as you two, clearly, but I'm aspiring, and frankly, I don't want to be with somebody who isn't.<eos> I mean, we're artists, right?<eos> What about your tits?<eos> Your nipples.<eos> Uh... you do know where your nipples are, don't you?<eos> Do not look at Miss Wolf.<eos> She can't help you.
The audience pays you to show them who they really are inside because they're too busy or they're too frightened to look.<eos> But if you walk on that stage looking for approval, you're cheating them.<eos> You're not acting.<eos> You're begging.<eos> You, Ms. Jacobson, are a beggar.<eos> You don't want to be seen. You just want to be liked.<eos> You're an approval junkie.<eos> To me, that is sad.<eos> You're an approval junkie.<eos> You care too much what others think of you.

It's what you think that matters.
What's the point of understanding why you're miserable if you're still miserable?<eos> It's like the booby prize.<eos> I disagree, Shauna.<eos> I have seen tangible behavioral improvement in you.<eos> You've been so much more confident and more optimistic.<eos> I'm taking Prozac.<eos> My doctor prescribed it for me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I wish you'd told me.<eos> You obviously feel it's helping?

Now, we are both as upset as you are about this, I can assure you.<eos> You know, we have done our best, with very limited resources... to try and... make you comfortable here.<eos> Now, I appreciate that, I really do.<eos> And you repay us by staging and selling... this crazy photo?<eos> Look, I... I don't want to sound like I'm full of myself... but, you know, there are people out there, and in here, in this case, who are interested in taking pictures of celebrities, even minor ones such as myself.<eos> Mmm-hmm. It ain't her fault the paps after her like a Jolie-Pitt baby.<eos> Ah. You're saying you had no knowledge of this photo being taken.<eos> I'm just living my life, Mr. Caputo.<eos> And while I am aware that a jailhouse romance is discouraged... sometimes... you just can't fight your passions.<eos> Now, I'm sure that you are no stranger to the vagaries of love.
In fact, it was a pain in the ass.<eos> I had to call around all day.<eos> Point is, I found it.<eos> 50 pounds of lye under "Donato."<eos> You got your Donato ID?<eos> Good.<eos> Give me a call if there's a problem.<eos> Don't shoot.<eos> What the hell you doing here?<eos> I told you, I had an emergency.
Now take the missing numbers, bunch of gobbledygook, until you take up these dots and arrows from underneath the numbers...<eos> - Latitude and longitude.<eos> - Exactly. The Dark Isles, a chain of uninhabited islands in the Black Sea.<eos> - What's there?<eos> - Behinds a dead platinum mine, nothing.<eos> Can NRO give us some more recent satellite images?<eos> You're looking at it.<eos> Apparently, it's not exactly a high priority.<eos> I've expedited clearance through the State Department to investigate.<eos> An FBI attaché will meet you in Ankara, Turkey, and escort you to the island.
Let me talk to her first.<eos> No.<eos> That's not how this works.<eos> How did you know of this place?<eos> Brave FBI man, huh?<eos> How do you know of this place?<eos> You don't answer, they pay.<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> How do you know of this place?<eos> Is there anyone else with you?
_<eos> _<eos> Turkish coffee?<eos> - You know, I've had the warm water they call coffee here.<eos> Uh, I'm...<eos> Mmm. Let me start by saying that what happened to Mr. Wagner was a terrible tragedy.<eos> And, what's worse, it was a tragedy that was completely avoidable.<eos> So I hope you can appreciate that it's my job to make sure something like this never happens again.<eos> Let's start with the basics.<eos> When was the first time you removed classified documents from the FBI's New York Office, what did you do with these documents once you removed them, and were you aware at the time that you were breaking federal law?
When was the first time you removed classified documents from the FBI's New York Office, what did you do with these documents once you removed them, and were you aware at the time that you were breaking federal law?<eos> I mean, look... everyone brings their work home with them sometimes.<eos> They do?<eos> Who else is bringing classified documents home with them?<eos> - No, I just...<eos> - You just said that everyone brings their work home with them sometimes.<eos> Can you give me some examples?<eos> Then would you like to revise your statement?<eos> Let's try again.<eos> When was the first time you removed classified documents from the FBI's New York Office, where did you store these documents once you removed them, and were you aware at the time that you were breaking federal law?
You know, Jonas, you're never gonna be the head of the NYO.<eos> That's a bit of a non-sequitur, Bethany.<eos> You think I don't know you've been campaigning internally?<eos> Trying to line up allies.<eos> But first, you need me out of the way.<eos> So if I was fired and disgraced, then you could really make a move, couldn't you?<eos> You looked surprised.<eos> Yet another reason why you'll never sit in this chair.<eos> Agent Patterson is suspended.<eos> If you don't like it, take it up with the Director.
Oh, absolutely.<eos> I'm suspending you indefinitely, effective immediately.<eos> - What?<eos> No.<eos> - I'll need your weapon, your badge, your credentials.<eos> Please, just wait.<eos> Wait?<eos> For what?<eos> Look, you're obviously very smart, probably remotely competent, but you're reckless.<eos> You got your boyfriend killed.
I was wondering if we could drop my detail.<eos> I mean, I'm not under arrest, right?<eos> I'm not in custody.<eos> I'm risking my life with everyone else.<eos> And I think I've proven my loyalty by now.<eos> That detail is for your protection.<eos> It should be my choice.<eos> I think I've earned that.<eos> All right.<eos> If you continue to stay in the safe house, I'll drop your detail as long as you understand the risks.
We're on a pretty tight schedule, so let's split up.<eos> Reade, why don't you track down the lawyer that did the appeal and find out what they had.<eos> Tasha and I will take the jet and talk to Ronnie.<eos> We got 36 hours before Ronnie Vargas is executed.<eos> Let's make sure the State of Delaware isn't killing an innocent man.<eos> Ronnie, why don't we start from the beginning?<eos> Give us your side of the story.<eos> I'm dying tomorrow.<eos> That's my side.<eos> There's a chance we can help you.
And now, he says he's guilty.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> Jane.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I have a session with Borden.<eos> I figured I shouldn't miss that just for a migraine.<eos> Look, I know that yesterday was a tough day.<eos> If there's something else going on, you can tell me.<eos> Weller.<eos> Reade just got back and needs to talk to you.
I didn't choose any of this.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - No. You don't understand.<eos> Then explain it to me.<eos> I know how freeing it must seem to walk away from all of this, but running from your problems doesn't fix them.<eos> No, it might fix this.<eos> What is it that you're not telling me?<eos> You're hiding something.<eos> You have been for weeks.<eos> I can't help you if you won't tell me the truth.

Don't you move!<eos> Anyone besides me even read her file?<eos> Does this even look like the same girl to you?<eos> Who are you?<eos> You with the feds?<eos> She's been here for an hour already.<eos> Whoever she's working with won't be far behind.<eos> Gentlemen!<eos> My apologies, but we're gonna have to cut this night short.<eos> But rest assured, I will make it up to each and every one of you in spades.
I didn't mean to...<eos> I've worked for ZOMO for seven years.<eos> No one talks with him, no one meets with him, no one knows who he is, including me.<eos> So you don't know who you work for?<eos> Do you know how long this is gonna take?<eos> Because I have, like, a line of people waiting outside - to see the missing painting.<eos> - To see what?<eos> It's been stolen.<eos> Some things are more meaningful in their absence.<eos> If you and ZOMO don't talk to each other, - how does he communicate with you?
"Do this, do that." Um...<eos> This one was attached to the painting when it was sent to the gallery.<eos> Before it was stolen, obviously.<eos> "Kristy, hang this."<eos> Tasha, bag this.<eos> This guy gets paid, doesn't he?<eos> Where do they send his checks?<eos> ZOMO's a cash-only business.<eos> Deals with a pretty annoying system of rotating drop points and couriers.<eos> I'm telling you, this guy makes J.D. Salinger look like an extrovert.
- How did they figure out who he was?<eos> But he said when he got there, this guy just handed him a sketch.<eos> And said he wanted him to paint it for a show.<eos> - The burning rose.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> Why would ZOMO go to the park if this guy was threatening him?<eos> Well, ZOMO's whole artistic life was based on mystery.<eos> My guess, he was too curious to stay home.<eos> And when he found out he was being blackmailed to make art, well, he would have eaten that up with a spoon.<eos> He told you all this on a postcard?
Nobody gets out alive... if I take my finger off this button.<eos> Your job was to destroy these chemical weapons.<eos> Our enemies have chemical and biological weapons.<eos> You think that we're setting an example by burning our stockpile, singing "Kumbaya"?<eos> It's delusional!<eos> We need to maintain the stockpile.<eos> Did you sell it to a foreign country?<eos> I needed a way to pay for this facility, so I sold a nominal amount to South Korea, our allies.<eos> Then someone found out about your sale and ambushed them.<eos> Thousands of lives are at risk now... because of you.
Stand up!<eos> She double-crossed you?<eos> We've been doing deliveries of sarin to Seoul every quarter for the last three years.<eos> She's the only one who knows the ins and the outs of the operation.<eos> Who is she selling it to?<eos> I don't know, but when I realized it was her, I was afraid she'd come here.<eos> I knew I needed to destroy all this before it's too late.<eos> How much sarin is missing?<eos> 40 canisters.<eos> Did Vanessa help you move the weapons out of the country to Korea?
Do you think she was helping them with an American target?<eos> Who do you work for?<eos> Thousands of people, including us and your own family, could be exposed to the sarin if you don't help us.<eos> Who do you work for?<eos> North Korea.<eos> Your container was headed for China.<eos> The plan was to move the crates through China into North Korea.<eos> - What's the target here?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I don't believe you!
I don't believe you!<eos> What is the target here?<eos> I sold them the weapons, that's it.<eos> I had no idea they were planning to use them here.<eos> The South Koreans pay me to help the general.<eos> But the North Koreans made me a better offer.<eos> The North Korean government is behind this?<eos> They're a radical faction within the government.<eos> And you have no idea what they're going to target?<eos> I swear to you, I don't know.
Something's been bugging me ever since our chat the other day.<eos> I appreciate you being honest about your bias against Jane, but...<eos> Everything about that talk just feels off.<eos> You think I'm lying?<eos> I think we're wired the same.<eos> Even as a young agent, everybody knew me as a straight shooter.<eos> I'll take that a compliment.<eos> The only time I ever strayed from my instincts was when I was scared.<eos> Now, I don't know what you're dealing with, but I think you need to tell me.<eos> I told you the truth.
I'll take that a compliment.<eos> The only time I ever strayed from my instincts was when I was scared.<eos> Now, I don't know what you're dealing with, but I think you need to tell me.<eos> I told you the truth.<eos> I'm sorry if you don't believe me, but I don't know what else to say.<eos> Anything else?<eos> No.<eos> Five grand.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Could I start you off with something to drink?
Ah, I am a little short on cash.<eos> Um, what does this get me?<eos> Oh, what?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm just looking out for my partner.<eos> We're not partners.<eos> No?<eos> The deal's off?<eos> Oh, well, I guess I should just put the bracelets on you, call it a night.<eos> I gave you everything I have on Carter.
Dennis, come on.<eos> It's a $2,000 bottle of wine.<eos> Leave her alone.<eos> Mind your own business.<eos> Let her go and walk away.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, there's still like... $1,250 of wine left in here.<eos> Can I pour you a glass?
I wouldn't be here if you had just told me which tattoo you'd solved.<eos> That's no fun.<eos> Neither is this!<eos> But, I mean, this is a little fun.<eos> Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Hey!<eos> What's wrong with you?
Yeah, said every stubborn person ever.<eos> What else?<eos> Wait.<eos> What is this?<eos> Come here.<eos> Who the hell is this?<eos> You haven't followed our instructions.<eos> If you do anything to her, I'll do everything in my power...<eos> You don't get to make the threats.<eos> I told you to stop looking into Tom Carter's disappearance.
And the name of that star is...<eos> Aldebaran.<eos> Oh, we solved it!<eos> Oh, this is great!<eos> What is Aldebaran?<eos> This is the only place within 300 miles with Aldebaran in the name.<eos> I can't imagine why.<eos> I mean, it just rolls off the tongue.<eos> The tattoo must point to something in here.<eos> Can I help you?
No.<eos> Please.<eos> The FBI is not watching you.<eos> I...<eos> I just...<eos> I stumbled in here because of some stupid crossword puzzle.<eos> They've resumed their messages.<eos> No.<eos> Who's they?<eos> Maybe I can help you.
Freeze!<eos> Drop that weapon.<eos> - Put that weapon down. - Easy.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> I'm just here to stop...<eos> - Get on your knees.<eos> - Let's talk about this.<eos> Get on your knees!<eos> Come on, we can work this out.<eos> - I can get you anything you want. - Shut up!
My hands are already up.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Do it, now!<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> - My team...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Don't shoot me, please.<eos> I'm not going to shoot you.<eos> I told you, I'm FBI.
You okay?<eos> All right, I'm gonna get you to safety.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't leave Nick.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Va...<eos> Valerie. Hey, Valerie, my name is Edgar.<eos> I'm a special agent with the FBI.<eos> I'm sorry to tell you this, but there's nothing we can do for Nick now.
A lot of innocent people died today.<eos> He's alive.<eos> What's he trying to say to us?<eos> I think he's talking to the shooter.<eos> Reade.<eos> Give us your location.<eos> Levi, killing Jones won't solve anything man.<eos> Whatever trouble you were in before...<eos> This ain't about none of that.<eos> Well, talk to me. Let me help you, man.
Well, talk to me. Let me help you, man.<eos> Quit stalling.<eos> Tell me where Jones is... now.<eos> All right, he's on the west side of the building, where I left him barricaded.<eos> What room?<eos> I don't remember, but if you get me to the field house I can take you to him.<eos> Just... just get me to the field house.<eos> Levi, why you doing this, bruh?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> It matters to you.
I saw 'em, and I knew it wasn't just Tim and me.<eos> I lost it.<eos> We were going to blow the lid off everything, then they busted me for drugs.<eos> Take away all our credibility.<eos> They all covered for him!<eos> I didn't mean to kill any of those students, but they got in the way.<eos> Listen, Levi, you have another choice.<eos> Put the gun down and let me help you.<eos> You can't help me.<eos> I believe you.

Please.
I'm trying to offer you another way out. Please.<eos> I died a long time ago.<eos> Walk.<eos> Walk!<eos> It didn't have to end this way.<eos> I'm sorry, buddy.<eos> You did everything you could to get him out of here alive.<eos> Reade...<eos> Jones.<eos> All the bloodshed, everyone who died, all the families that lost someone... is because of you.
You're welcome to join tonight.<eos> Sawyer's picking dinner, so it's either gonna be pizza or hot dogs with hush puppies.<eos> That sounds like fun.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> You asked for a psych consultant.<eos> Oh, yeah, a young patient came in this morning.<eos> She was found wandering the streets of Chelsea, covered in blood.<eos> There's been no missing person's reports yet.<eos> - What has she told you?
How do you know Nermin Ahmadi?<eos> It's getting repetitive at this point, but I will... say it again.<eos> I can't reveal my sources.<eos> Well, she's not much of a source to you anymore.<eos> She's dead.<eos> Her body was found in a Hell's Kitchen apartment this morning, tortured to death.<eos> So, again, how do you know Nermin and why was she here?<eos> Did you help her get into the country?<eos> We believe the Ahmadis are here to plan a domestic attack.<eos> What did Nermin tell you about their target?
Nermin wanted out, so I offered her safe passage to the U.S.<eos> in exchange for an interview.<eos> When did she arrive?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> And did she say anything about any more of the Ahmadis coming to the States?<eos> Do you know anything about an attack on U.S. soil?<eos> We were supposed to meet... again tonight to talk.<eos> I...<eos> I never thought that they would follow her here.<eos> If they killed Nermin because she was talking to you, you do realize you're the next target.

I'm gonna go to the shed.<eos> Okay, Weller and Jane are here.<eos> - Stay down.<eos> - It's a matter of minutes until they realize we're up here.<eos> Yeah. We're sitting ducks.<eos> We need to get Maya on the ground before the guys follow us up here.<eos> Go!<eos> Another one is coming inside.<eos> We gotta take her down now.<eos> Okay. What about you?
- You okay?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Hey, you all right?<eos> We heard about your fall.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I just banged up my ankle a little bit.<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> - Yeah. She's gonna be fine.<eos> I knew this was a terrible idea.<eos> You nearly got her killed.
Amin, escort Agent Booth to holding, please.<eos> What? You're throwing me in there with Caleb?<eos> I just got done telling you Alex is trying to frame me.<eos> And the bomb is in your truck, and the plans are on your computer.<eos> Until I know what the hell is going on, you are a person of interest in this investigation.<eos> Amin, do it.<eos> In one week, your training will be complete.<eos> It may have taken almost 140 days, but we have broken you down and built you back up.<eos> You've come a long way since you first got here.<eos> I never gave this back to you.
In one week, your training will be complete.<eos> It may have taken almost 140 days, but we have broken you down and built you back up.<eos> You've come a long way since you first got here.<eos> I never gave this back to you.<eos> Top of your class.<eos> Your father would be proud.<eos> Now, I'm not sure if that's a comfort.<eos> Or a curse?<eos> I don't know, myself. I know you and I had a rocky start.<eos> I wasn't sure you had the right intentions of coming here, but you proved me wrong, and I would be honored to work with you in the field someday.
You're getting closer. Soon, all this will come to an end.<eos> Please, Drew.<eos> You don't have to do this. Release my son, Miranda.<eos> He and Ms. Wyatt are the key to finding and stopping this before it's too late.<eos> If we're going to release Caleb, we have to release Ryan and my sister.<eos> We're gonna need all the help we can get.<eos> Do it.<eos> The Forensic Science Research and Training Center is the premier crime lab in the U.S.<eos> It is its own division within the FBI, with over 500 scientific experts and agents working alongside one another.<eos> Today, you will have unrestricted access to actual physical evidence from the terrorist events you've been assigned.
I don't know... a dozen different federal laws that you've broken.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Where are the other agents, the sirens, the handcuffs?<eos> They're coming. Trust me.<eos> And why would you warn me?<eos> I know what you think of me.<eos> You deserve to go to jail.<eos> You deserve to pay for every single thing that you've done, but Shelby doesn't.<eos> I read the letter that you wrote her, that you would do anything to be in her life again.<eos> I just don't believe you.
Forgive yourself.<eos> - We should go over the trainees' final exam one more time before...<eos> Why are you asking me that?<eos> Omaha was your first case assignment out of the Academy, and you were in Chicago, too.<eos> So I'm just wondering, "What's under your floorboards?"<eos> You want to know the truth?<eos> Or what they told me to say?<eos> And who are "they"?<eos> You know who they are.<eos> They're the ones who talked to you after Chicago, told you how to handle it.
Ah, well, we were in over our heads.<eos> Before we knew what happened, it was too late.<eos> The guilt sent Michael down a spiral.<eos> Well, I held on to the top of the bottle with one hand while he drowned at the bottom.<eos> You know, he wanted to come clean. He wanted to tell the truth about what had happened.<eos> But they wouldn't let him?<eos> I thought that Chicago was a mistake, but it was a pattern.<eos> You find the shortcuts, and other people pay the price.<eos> This isn't an exact science.<eos> I'm sorry. I can't follow you to D.C.
Mm, we're all alone out there.<eos> What if I don't want to be?<eos> I mean, it doesn't have to be the way it was.<eos> We don't have to be the kind of agents that cut corners to close cases or miss signs or put covering our asses over saving lives.<eos> You know, we... we both have two weeks before we start our new jobs.<eos> Why don't we take that time and run away together... you know, off the grid, completely off the map... and get to really know each other before we have to start working together and never get a chance to?<eos> You came here to say something, and I completely steamrolled you.<eos> That can wait.<eos> Thank you for your reports.<eos> We save this lesson about the Bureau's darkest days for the final week in hopes that it will stay with you long after you leave... 'cause too often, these lessons are forgotten, especially in times of crisis.
Hey, Dad, you coming?<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Oh, you changed your mind about dinner.<eos> I did.<eos> And the portrait?<eos> How come?<eos> Because we're family.<eos> Abandoned in the face of fear or greed or both.<eos> But if there's one lesson I can teach you, it's that each of you knows in your heart what is right...
You partially built the bomb we're looking for.<eos> Don't you think you've helped enough?<eos> Nimah. We need him.<eos> He's the only one who knows about this technology.<eos> And he knows Miranda.<eos> Fine.<eos> Let him help... out there.<eos> Simon. I'm sorry.<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> I jumped on a plane the second I heard about you and that bomb.
It's after midnight.<eos> You're really getting good at this, Ryan.<eos> I was gonna tell you.<eos> Yeah, but not until you had to, right?<eos> Shelby, you're leaving?<eos> It's your last night. Savor it.<eos> Thank you, Senator Haas.<eos> Claire.<eos> For you, always Claire.<eos> I know things, uh, didn't work out with you and Caleb, but I hope that we can still be friends.

I have plans for you, Alex Parrish.<eos> Dad, is that you?<eos> Who are...? Hi.<eos> Wait, you're...<eos> I'm Alex Parrish. I'm from the FBI.<eos> Yeah, no, I know who you are. You're everywhere.<eos> Plus my dad talks about you a lot.<eos> Um, oh, I'm Louisa, his...<eos> Daughter.<eos> Yes, I know. He talks about you, too, but I-I thought you were...
- Alex.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> "Stay out of sight"?<eos> This is my fault.<eos> I got to fix this.<eos> And we will, Simon.<eos> Together.<eos> Come on.<eos> You may have wondered why this course was so long, make you leave your lives, fly you here, away from the real world for six long months.<eos> While the real world, the one you used to know... It evaporates the moment we hand you your badge and gun.

Hello, Alex.<eos> Thank you for being here, Madam Vice President.<eos> Thank you for inviting me.<eos> I hope you're well. How's your health?<eos> My health's fine.<eos> Blood pressure not bothering you anymore?<eos> According to your medical records that were released after the election, you don't have a blood-pressure problem, hence you don't have a blood-pressure prescription.<eos> So I don't understand why Liam O'Connor would blackmail me into swapping out pills that you were never really taking.<eos> I'm sorry. Were you asking me a question or making an accusation?<eos> I'm giving you a chance to tell me the truth before I devote my life to proving it.
I'm not wearing a wire, ma'am.<eos> Wire or no wire, the answer's the same.<eos> But you knew about him.<eos> All that matters now is that we serve our country...<eos> Me as vice president of a nation that is in desperate need of leadership, and you wherever your blinding idealism takes you.<eos> My idealism isn't blinded at all.<eos> In fact, I'm seeing things very clearly now.<eos> I see a woman who colluded with a terrorist to fake a nuclear bomb attack right at the eve of the elections to remind her voters about her national security bona fides.<eos> Wow, you really wanted to win that election at any cost, and not for the greater good, but for yourself.<eos> You do realize that you are insinuating that I killed people...
That trip we were gonna take after your graduation.<eos> What about it?<eos> Well, it turns out that I have some leave days saved up.<eos> How many?<eos> Let me think. One... carry the... 110.<eos> Hop in.<eos> This won't take long.<eos> Alexandra Parrish, my name is Matthew Keyes.<eos> It is my belief, as it is many others who work for me, that the FBI treated you terribly.<eos> They didn't trust you, they certainly didn't help you, and then they hung you out to dry.

Be careful.<eos> They're looking for you.<eos> I know.<eos> You think you're strong?<eos> Well, somebody's stronger.<eos> You think you're fast?<eos> There's somebody faster.<eos> Close quarters combat isn't about strength and speed.<eos> It's about who can adapt more quickly to their surroundings.<eos> Technique will help you.
How about, when I'm not your trainee anymore, maybe we could get caught up on everything over dinner.<eos> T-minus two weeks before I'm your equal.<eos> Well, not quite equal.<eos> I'll rise fast.<eos> All right, two weeks, and you might need more than one dinner.<eos> There's still a lot you don't know.<eos> Panic attacks, insecurity, insubordination, exasperation, crippling self-doubt...<eos> These are all symptoms trainees have experienced on their first day of work at their new field office.<eos> So, here at the Academy, we're trying something different.<eos> We're gonna give you a chance to visit a field office before you graduate.
How about I stop you instead?<eos> I don't care who your family is, but you're done.<eos> I spoke with my supervisor, and we're going to test you today.<eos> Let me guess... You want us to play one person and swap back and forth?<eos> Yes, but that's not the hard part.<eos> We've already told an agent in the office that you will be posing as one trainee.<eos> This agent knows who you are, but you don't know who they are.<eos> The test is simple...<eos> Identify your contact without blowing your cover.<eos> Just like in the field, they can't walk up to you and say, "Nice to meet you.
And I don't?<eos> I can still feel it every morning.<eos> A .45 will do that to you.<eos> You got shot?<eos> Sounds like Booth and O'Connor may have left out some key details of the sting.<eos> Blown sting.<eos> Yeah, and he's the one that blew it.<eos> The guy left his post the same night that cell just happened to plan their attack.<eos> So, you think that Ryan turned his back on purpose?<eos> What did he tell you, that it wasn't his fault?
Did you figure out who our contact is?<eos> Not yet. But I'm enjoying very much working with Agent Garnett.<eos> I still did my job.<eos> This is a list of all the agents in the office.<eos> I've crossed out 10 I know for sure weren't assigned to us.<eos> If he flirts, flirt back.<eos> I was wondering where you'd gone.<eos> One of the NATs wanted to know what I thought of my assignment.<eos> And what did you tell them?<eos> Can I tell you all about it on the rest of the tour?
What did I do? What did I do?<eos> FBI!<eos> Stay back. - Brandon.<eos> - Nobody told you to come in here.<eos> Scott, listen to me...<eos> You don't want to hurt him.<eos> I never hurt anyone.<eos> I never touched anyone.<eos> I know.<eos> And we're gonna get you the help you need, but first you got to let him go.
We'll talk transition.<eos> -You got it.<eos> It's more than a few, as you know.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> God damn it.<eos> Who do I have to fuck around here to get a network connection for Chrissakes?<eos> -And this is Robert Kirsch.<eos> -Daniel Miller.<eos> -Hi there.<eos> Your reputation precedes you. Oh.
We're the first to be hit twice, and today we lost an agent.<eos> But please, let's not react from the gut.<eos> First order of business is to comb our assets. Is that clear?<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> I know we're all worried about ourselves.<eos> I understand -- human nature, self-preservation.<eos> We want to see if our dirty laundry's gonna be hung out. I get it.<eos> I have one request.<eos> If you're holding on to something that could damage you and by extension, this station, come to me with it first, so we can get ahead of this thing together.<eos> I can't pretend that I can save your job, but I can promise you that I will stand with you because your honesty now could save the rest of us.
Plus I forget I'm wearing these cotton balls for shoes.<eos> They help absorb the smell.<eos> But you two pretty ladies don't care about that.<eos> Um, I'm Dr. Reggie, the unlucky SOB who has to make sure the dead don't rise again.<eos> You suck at your job.<eos> Uh, excuse me?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Did you do this autopsy report?<eos> If I'd done this, I wouldn't have misspelled "breasts."<eos> I can tell you something about the body.
What on Earth possessed you to strike him?<eos> He assaulted one of my men. Now, tell me.<eos> Why isn't he here instead of me?<eos> Because an Arab workman is not a French duke.<eos> He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Maspero, and you know it.<eos> We're trying to do serious work.<eos> We're not a sideshow for tourists.<eos> Your work relies on the delicate balance of good will, which I must maintain.<eos> Here you have French bureaucracy against British foreign interest against Egyptian home rule.<eos> The country is a powder barrel and you sit above it, flicking matches at whomsoever displeases you.
Number three.<eos> What have you got?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Sir Carnarvon.<eos> It's Lord Carnarvon.<eos> You say Lord Carnarvon or sir.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Lord Carnarvon.<eos> May I make a suggestion?<eos> I'm not taking any stolen goods from you, do you hear me?
What's a cup with his name on doing in our dig?<eos> Well, your guess is as good as mine.<eos> Amarna was his capital.<eos> Petrie did some work there, actually.<eos> The thing is... that's 300 miles away.<eos> So how did Tutankhamun's cup get here?<eos> Now, Evelyn, this is Mr Carter.<eos> Carter, this is my daughter Evelyn.<eos> - Nice to meet you, Evelyn.<eos> - How do you do, Mr Carter?
- Why not?<eos> If there's a war, it's going to affect all of us.<eos> Come.<eos> You have to buy Davis' concession. Why?<eos> You heard Davis.<eos> Valley's all dug up...<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> But... ..suppose it's not.<eos> There's something I'd like to show you.
Not that, not your head.<eos> I don't give a damn about that.<eos> In your heart... in your belly.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Like a white elixir.<eos> Incredibly heavy.<eos> Incredibly ancient.<eos> It's there.<eos> The concession is yours.<eos> - I wish you the best of fortune.
Selim.<eos> Come in. (GREETS HIM IN ARABIC)<eos> It's good to see you again. - And you.<eos> - And you.<eos> You have the eyes of a man who has seen too much of the desert.<eos> I should think I do.<eos> Mr Carter, my brother, Jahi.<eos> You speak Arabic?<eos> I told you, Mr Carter is not like the other British.<eos> - How are you?
Go back home like you promised, and leave us to govern our own country?<eos> Jahi.<eos> I'm not a soldier.<eos> Archaeologist.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> They're needed here.<eos> Morris, it's just 20 men.<eos> It's 20 men I can't spare.<eos> I'm sorry, Carter.<eos> - Look, I can let you have your foreman. - But that's it.
He's supposed to be out here somewhere.<eos> They said find a hole, look in it and you might find him at the bottom.<eos> - Evelyn?<eos> - Goodness! That took a while.<eos> Well done, though.<eos> Hello, Carter.<eos> We arrived this morning.<eos> Mama got into some frightful fuss with the staff at the American House and Papa's having to pour oil on troubled waters.<eos> I imagine we'll never get our drinks served on time again.<eos> So I decided to jump ship and come and see how you're doing.

Right.<eos> She's the one you need to convince, not him.<eos> I see.<eos> Yes.<eos> You still believe it's here, don't you?<eos> You haven't given up?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I...<eos> They'll be here this afternoon.<eos> You'd better be convincing, Carter, or they'll shut you down.

A statement to the world.<eos> Yes, my father was a heretic but he was still my father and I will have him standing beside me in the afterlife.<eos> Now, that is not the voice of a boy who's afraid.<eos> It's simply not!<eos> It is the voice of a pharaoh, a man of decision and conviction.<eos> And a pharaoh would not skulk in the shadows at the edge of the Valley.<eos> He would be there.<eos> At the centre.<eos> No. I'm sorry, Carter.<eos> You know I trust you but... The truth is, the estate is all but entailed and I simply don't have the money to risk everything on...
Of course.<eos> - Come to bed?<eos> - In a minute.<eos> I never thought I'd see Carter in a dress coat.<eos> - It suits him, don't you think?<eos> - He looks almost respectable.<eos> He's not living in his tomb any more.<eos> I've been imagining him in there during the war. But he's moved out.<eos> I helped him find a house.<eos> That was good of you.
What is it?<eos> My father wants to see you.<eos> - Is it important?<eos> - Oh, there isn't anything really.<eos> I just didn't fancy explaining myself.<eos> Does your father know you're here?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> I thought about you a lot during the war.<eos> What was happening.<eos> Whether you were all right.
You saw a picture of a bird and it upset you.<eos> You see, the date was wrong.<eos> Tutmosis the Third predates Tutankhamun.<eos> If we're finding relics from his reign, then we can't be in the right spot, you see.<eos> - The best we can hope for is... - Turn around.<eos> What?<eos> This way.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Are you all right?
- Are you hurt?<eos> - For God's sake Carter!<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - We have to go and help them.<eos> - No, no, no. It's not safe.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> Where's Evelyn?<eos> Have you seen her?<eos> I thought she was with you.
- It's all right.<eos> I'm not gonna try to convince you to come with me.<eos> I'm not a fool.<eos> I belong here.<eos> And she's here.<eos> I...?<eos> You silly man.<eos> Do you not even know?<eos> Whatever was I thinking?<eos> Papa's looking for you.
- I know perfectly well it's been covered.<eos> And you think we missed something?<eos> You could go through this sand with a fine-mesh sieve and not turn up anything new.<eos> Well, I lost a cufflink out there in '07. If one of your chaps turns it up, do let me know. Mm-hm.<eos> I thought you were confined to barracks.<eos> Papa says I can go out as long as Murtaaz here doesn't leave my side.<eos> So, now you're where you should be, how does it feel?<eos> Well, pretty good.<eos> And frightening.<eos> But I think I have you to thank.
Knew you were the right man for the job.<eos> I've never heard of this Tutankhamun.<eos> If I'm right, that would mean that he is buried here.<eos> Thought about you a lot during the war.<eos> What was happening.<eos> Whether you were all right.
- In the way. - Mm-hm.<eos> Right, well. Erm...<eos> Take a load of water to the men, will you?<eos> Yes, and then fill up the troughs for the mules. Hm?<eos> Mr Carter?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Er, my name's Merton. I...<eos> I don't believe we've met.<eos> I'm the Times' correspondent in Cairo.<eos> - How do you do?
Yes, and then fill up the troughs for the mules. Hm?<eos> Mr Carter?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Er, my name's Merton. I...<eos> I don't believe we've met.<eos> I'm the Times' correspondent in Cairo.<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - Yes, erm, this site is closed to visitors. Oh, I see.<eos> Well, I...<eos> I didn't mean to intrude, but you must, of course, be aware you are the object of quite some interest right now.
I mean, I would consider it a privilege.<eos> You came all the way from Cairo to say that?<eos> Mr Carter, I'd go almost to the ends of the earth right now to find a story that doesn't involve Arabs rioting or British soldiers shooting people or civil unrest.<eos> Cairo to the Valley of the Kings was no distance at all.<eos> - Well, Mr, er...<eos> - Merton.<eos> Mr Merton. It seems we're both hoping for good news.<eos> If, and when, I have some... I'll be sure to let you know.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> That's... that's very kind of you.
That's... that's very kind of you.<eos> Not coming for dinner?<eos> Sometimes it's just as pleasant to dine alone.<eos> Ah, indeed.<eos> Take a bottle of the Margaux instead, Carter prefers it.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Tomb robbers.<eos> But... - I brought food.<eos> Well, gentlemen. You must excuse me.<eos> I will say good night to you all.
- What do you have?<eos> - Look. It's still sealed.<eos> Do you know what this says?<eos> "Amun...<eos> Tut...<eos> Ankh."<eos> It's him.<eos> This is... It's really him.<eos> This is the tomb.<eos> Er, thank you all very much.
We could not be more delighted that you're here with your colleagues from the Antiquities Service.<eos> Come along, have a drink.<eos> There's people I'd very much like you to meet.<eos> Of course, first of all, my esteemed colleague, Mr Carter.<eos> - Monsieur Lacau.<eos> - Mr Carter.<eos> - Mr Lacau.<eos> - Shall we?<eos> Right. Erm...<eos> After you.
Let us see what you see.<eos> No, you see, I can't be dealing with press or cameras. - Ah!<eos> - Too much, it interferes with the dig.<eos> The crowds are already out of control as it is.<eos> - But then...<eos> - No, what I'm suggesting here,<eos> Mr Merton, is a specific relationship.<eos> You, that is, the Times.<eos> You get access.<eos> I'll talk to you.

No one else will print it!<eos> And now we have a dig crew who are afraid to work, we have mobs throwing rocks at our men, and a telegram from the Foreign Office, asking what the hell I think I'm playing at.<eos> This is exactly what Lacau wants.<eos> I never for a moment considered that my...<eos> Anyone with a modicum of common sense would have considered!<eos> Would have thought twice!<eos> How in God's name could you be so incompetent?<eos> - I found this tomb.<eos> - Oh, you found the tomb?<eos> And that gives you the right to run roughshod over the press?

My...<eos> Do you think that gives you licence to bed my daughter? You?
- I will make this very clear.<eos> Very clear indeed.<eos> You will not see my daughter again, you will not speak to her, you will not write to her, you will leave her alone.<eos> Or find yourself another position.<eos> Would you allow me to speak?<eos> Not for myself, for Evelyn.<eos> You, sir, are responsible.<eos> You.<eos> Don't you dare put words into my daughter's mouth.<eos> - I've nothing more to say to you.
The seals are still in tact.<eos> You found something wonderful.<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> The contents of any royal tomb is the property of the Antiquities Service and will remain in Egypt.<eos> You are the talk of the world.<eos> Did it never cross your mind that to favour one newspaper to the exclusion of all others would turn every other journalist in the world against us?<eos> How in God's name could you be so incompetent?<eos> Do you think that gives you licence to bed my daughter?<eos> !<eos> I've nothing more to say to you.
Someone's spread the story he's got half of King Tut's treasures stashed under his bed.<eos> How is he?<eos> Evelyn said he wasn't well.<eos> It's blood poisoning.<eos> What?<eos> Is it serious?<eos> How did it come on so quickly?<eos> Carter, go and see the man.<eos> Mr Carter?<eos> It was so good of you to come.

What on earth have you got?<eos> Courtesy of Mr Goldwin.<eos> Fancy yourself as a movie star?<eos> - Ready?<eos> All set, Harry?<eos> Ready.<eos> More light, please.<eos> Sweet, Lord! What is that?<eos> The shrine of a king.<eos> Are you comfortable like that?
That can come in handy.<eos> You mind helping me out with this one?<eos> Go.<eos> Of course.<eos> What do you say we go catch some bad guys?<eos> Uh, don't get carried away now.<eos> We'll take it day by day.<eos> See how it goes.<eos> It's so incredibly tragic.<eos> Can you think of anyone who might have wanted to kill Jordan?
Then we're doing something right.<eos> But it's time to kick things up a notch.<eos> No!<eos> My own fitness band?<eos> Oh, boy. I guess this means we're going steady, huh?<eos> He said, "Yes."<eos> Hey, you know, I really appreciate your dedication.<eos> To my training, and to your extracurricular duties.<eos> I mean, you're really plowing through your list.<eos> Mr. Du Clark, Dr. Lockett is anxious to show you something.
"You should've gotten that man's name?"<eos> Vaughn Du Clark, smartest man in the world until you stroke his ego.<eos> Then he's like all the rest.<eos> Sorry, player.<eos> The almond milk seems off.<eos> Just get me a kale-ginger juice.<eos> We were hoping to find Starlee.<eos> Poor thing was in no condition to play a devastated teenager.<eos> I pushed her call till 3:00.<eos> I'd be happy to get you time with her tomorrow.
- Steady. - Let's go pay Starlee a visit.<eos> Nice robot.<eos> It's a gift from a Chinese business associate.<eos> Sorry, there's nothing in here about it being able to hunt and kill zombies.<eos> Yeah, right now, I think we've got an even bigger zombie problem.<eos> Yeah? What would that be?<eos> Dr. Lockett gave me this.<eos> He said it contains all of Max Rager's secrets.<eos> He's going to give one to the press, too, if you don't stop him.<eos> Dr. Lockett really shouldn't have told you all this.
They're asking about casket styles, upholstery options, vermin resistance.<eos> Two relatively young people who called the same funeral home?<eos> Young people call all the time.<eos> Generally, on the behalf of old people.<eos> Ah. Let me give the database a little look-see.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't show either of those poor souls in our system.<eos> I hope they made arrangements elsewhere.<eos> Guessing it's a moot point when there are no bodies to bury.<eos> If you can think of anything else...
I have heard so much about you guys.<eos> I am so excited about my own little Brightborn baby.<eos> So, what makes a Brightborn baby different?<eos> And why is it so expensive?<eos> The fees aren't just for five-star services.<eos> They fund research.<eos> Our exclusive technology identifies and enhances your most viable embryos.<eos> Enhances your embryos how?<eos> I have no idea, I'm very lost.<eos> Brightborn can actually help you do that.

This is a lot of paperwork.<eos> I'm just kidding, but I'm willing to make that sacrifice, you know?<eos> As a mother, it's worth it.<eos> Susan, welcome.<eos> Evie, such a beautiful facility you've built here.<eos> Ira loves the pool.<eos> Yes. I didn't know you were coming too, Ira.<eos> The incident at your dental clinic is all of our concern.<eos> It was Sarah Manning and her people who killed your technician.<eos> Which is what I wanna tell you, Susan,
I'm just gonna grab a smoothie, two seconds.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I'll be right there.<eos> You have back-to-back C-sections right now.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I know.<eos> Fine, I'll be down in the lab.<eos> Excuse me, the other floors are off limits.<eos> Are you with a group? Uh... Uh, yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wanted to, uh, show you something.
The hardest people though are, like, pregnant women.<eos> 'Cause they're very self-centered, you know? Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, 'cause the mums are like...<eos> "No toxins, please," but I'm like, "Mummy has a mustache.<eos> "Mama needs bleach."<eos> Do you know what I mean? Mmm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, you know, I find this whole<eos> Brightborn thing kinda creepy...<eos> You don't even know the half of it.<eos> Can I trust you?
Read it.<eos> Eyelid teeth?<eos> Yes, and I'm being personally targeted, because I'm a whistle-blower, right?<eos> I'm like that guy who moved to Russia.<eos> And if that French blonde doctor hadn't saved me, I would be, like, physically dead right now.<eos> French doctor, do you mean Dr. Cormier?<eos> How do you know that name?<eos> How do you know that name?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Don't worry, I'm actually here to help you, Krystal.
- Is that quite expensive?<eos> What? No. No, it's cheap.<eos> Everyone's doing it.<eos> Spit in a cup, mail it off.<eos> I don't know that everyone's comfortable coughing up their genetic profile to a corporation.<eos> Can you back off?<eos> That better not be contraband food I see there.<eos> Back to your room, go on, get going.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, Tabitha, I'm going to need a urine sample from you.
Mika!<eos> Sarah.<eos> New software.<eos> Crafty, but anonymous.<eos> Look, Niki, another puzzle piece.<eos> See, Niki?<eos> We're getting closer.<eos> Never forget.<eos> This is how you treat someone who saved your skin?<eos> We have no intention of trusting you with the location of our safe house.
♪ Don't you get me wrong ♪<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> You don't recognize me?<eos> It's Trina, Beth.<eos> I specifically told you to drop it.<eos> And you went back to Club Neolution.<eos> You went to Lifespring Fertility.<eos> I didn't...<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I told you I was a carrier in confidence.
You said she was tracking someone named Susan Duncan? - Yeah.<eos> - Looks like, most recently, MK was tracking you. What?<eos> Phreaking your phone.<eos> Texts, calls, locations.<eos> What are you doing, MK?<eos> I know you want to protect Sarah's source, but motivating people to share information quickly is my specialty.<eos> We have our own tactics, thank you.<eos> If she'd have brought me with her I'd be out of your hair by now.<eos> Sarah.<eos> She wants you to meet her at Beth's, she's found something.
Oh, shit.<eos> Bioluminescence?<eos> Green fluorescent proteins.<eos> They must be using them as markers to track gene expression.<eos> So the bot's introducing foreign DNA?<eos> And it seems like, because the host died, it's all congregating in the tumor.<eos> I bet that's why Leekie had one.<eos> It's some kind of gene therapy delivery system. It could be changing Sarah's DNA.<eos> Over here.<eos> Behind you.
I would not stand up if I were you.<eos> Whatever this is, it's not necessary.<eos> Oh, yes, it is.<eos> What's your name? Hmm?<eos> I should know you, but I don't.<eos> I know you.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> Ferdinand Chevalier.<eos> Bastard son of the 10th Earl of Sussex.<eos> A stigma you still can't get over.
This stuff from Dr. Bosch better be worth it.<eos> Let's see what creepy Brightborn is all about.<eos> Are you having difficulty conceiving?<eos> Are you in a non-traditional relationship, seeking to have a child on your terms?<eos> Perhaps you have genetic risk factors.<eos> Totally seen that woman before. Whatever the reason...<eos> I think she was on Oprah.<eos> Here at Brightborn Technologies, we can help.<eos> I'm Evie Cho, CEO and founder of the Brightborn Group.<eos> We can help provide you and your family with the best chance at a fast conception, a smooth pregnancy and a healthy and thriving newborn.
Yeah, he said he had a hook-up. He must've pulled the trigger.<eos> I just gotta find my bag.<eos> Uh, mind you, I was picturing a fat-legged man wearing Crocs.<eos> No offense.<eos> It's just how y'all look where I come from.<eos> It is molly that we're getting?<eos> - Uh... - You know what?<eos> It don't matter. I'm not that choosy this time in the morning.<eos> Here we are.<eos> All right, how much do I owe you, honey?
No, you had to.<eos> She was changing.<eos> - How was she changing?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I couldn't see.<eos> These were found at the scene of the crime.<eos> Oh, gosh, they were supporters.<eos> That makes this tragedy even worse.<eos> Yes, this doubles it.<eos> Can I offer you some breads?
Oh, you know what, Constable, why don't I handle that for you?<eos> Hi, Detective Bell, homicide.<eos> Krystal Goderich, manicurist.<eos> You know, why don't we take this somewhere more private? You're the boss.<eos> So I was kept in this room for like an hour, and then they just gave me free samples.<eos> Like, can you believe that?<eos> Like, I'm a whistle-blower, I'm not gonna just, like, be paid off with free samples.<eos> Okay, wait, wait, wait. Let's just back up for one second, okay?<eos> Certainly.<eos> These people who are after you...
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Let's just back up for one second, okay?<eos> Certainly.<eos> These people who are after you...<eos> They're targeting beauty professionals.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, and some of us know what they're actually doing, which is hoarding patents in stem cell cosmetics.<eos> And totally testing on human beings. - Like, I'm against animal testing.<eos> - Okay. Like, humans is, like, too far.<eos> - Do you know what I mean? - Right.<eos> Does "LEDA" mean anything to you?
It's making you sick.<eos> You're immune to the disease.<eos> By activating specific genes, we hoped to isolate the illness.<eos> Apparently it hasn't flicked off the right switch yet.<eos> Why, 'cause I'm healthy?<eos> Because you're alive.<eos> We can have it out.<eos> We can start work on a cure today, if you just share Kendall.<eos> Only her unique biology makes human cloning possible.<eos> Those same cells could give you the CASTOR pathogen.
Beth?<eos> Beth thought she found her enemy.<eos> She was wrong.<eos> I hope you don't make the same mistake she did.<eos> Put your hands up.<eos> How did you find me?<eos> I'm a cop.<eos> I have resources.<eos> I figured it out.<eos> You're the head of the snake. You're where this all ends.
You can watch Scott work from there.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> Cosima says they've started.<eos> Last needle, I promise.<eos> Do you know why your biology is so unique, Mrs. Malone?<eos> Just my bloody luck.<eos> Yes, you're a true anomaly.<eos> The only clonable subject my husband ever found.<eos> No wonder he hid your identity so well.<eos> Hid me from the likes of you.
You're getting what you want, aren't you?<eos> I'd spit, but she'd probably bottle it.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - It's out. I'm coming.<eos> - Get Kendall on the move.<eos> - Okay. Is Cosima still with Evie?<eos> She'll leave Brightborn as soon as Susan has her samples.<eos> Finish up, Scott.<eos> You're done, Ma.<eos> Before you leave, Mrs. Malone, I want to thank you.
Nature is just a set of spare parts to you, isn't it?<eos> Well, I think of it more as a palette.<eos> Your research?<eos> Tell me what happened to Delphine Cormier.<eos> Who?<eos> The former head of Dyad.<eos> Oh.<eos> Doctor Cormier.<eos> Of course. Dyad's not my purview.<eos> I'm sorry. But I knew of her and her dedication to you.
There you go.<eos> Why am I out here?<eos> It won't be long.<eos> If you're too cold, I have a spare blanket.<eos> Nasty business that we're wrapped up in, isn't it?<eos> Someone's got their hooks in ya.<eos> I've been hunted around the world.<eos> What's your story?<eos> I'm just in over my head, lady. Just like everybody else.<eos> We can help you.
Someone's got their hooks in ya.<eos> I've been hunted around the world.<eos> What's your story?<eos> I'm just in over my head, lady. Just like everybody else.<eos> We can help you.<eos> My daughter, she hides people.<eos> How's that working out for you?<eos> Least I can look her in the eye.<eos> You're shivering.<eos> I'll get you that blanket.
Good morning.<eos> Is anybody there?<eos> Dear God.<eos> Ira, did you see it?<eos> What happened?<eos> You must have hit your head.<eos> It looked at me. I...<eos> I saw something in my eye.<eos> What a fine pair we are, aren't we?<eos> Gonna give you a little jail house 101.
Oh, yeah.<eos> I'm kind of a stopgap, but, yeah.<eos> She's Felix's sister, Adele.<eos> Felix has a sister?<eos> Just... just don't think about it right now.<eos> But...<eos> How much does she know?<eos> I don't need to know anything just yet, okay?<eos> Nothing that might incriminate you.<eos> All right, Donnie, gonna give you a little jail house 101.
- What do you want?<eos> Let's not make this about me.<eos> So how's Donnie?<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> - S, where the hell are you?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> What matters is I think I know how Evie Cho is gonna try and get to us.<eos> Why is Neolution harassing my husband?<eos> Donnie's innocent.<eos> You know what, this has got nothing to do with you and Donnie.
I just need to find her.<eos> Well, I don't know where she is.<eos> I don't.<eos> Jail's not a good place for a sensitive man like Donnie.<eos> I don't know how long he can survive in there.<eos> God.<eos> So you just have a little think about it, okay?<eos> Where would you find Sarah?<eos> The location.<eos> And I'm gonna get back in touch with you real soon.
I don't know how long he can survive in there.<eos> God.<eos> So you just have a little think about it, okay?<eos> Where would you find Sarah?<eos> The location.<eos> And I'm gonna get back in touch with you real soon.<eos> Son of a biscuit!<eos> Are you, uh...<eos> You all right?<eos> - Let me... Let me help you with this.
So how is Donnie doing?<eos> He's fine.<eos> Very comfortable in orange.<eos> You and Donnie are stalwart members of our congregation.<eos> But recently I... I feel like you've begun to take your... Your faith for granted.<eos> Reverend, the... The... The police and the arrest, that was all a huge misunderstanding.<eos> Was it?<eos> I'm sure the children who witnessed it are gonna be just fine.<eos> You know, with proper therapy.<eos> All I know, Ali, is you've got a secret laying heavy on your heart, and I can help you.

- Yep, I just have to do something.<eos> Look, I know that you're under a lot of pressure.<eos> But you need to keep strong, okay?<eos> Of course.<eos> Your sisters are there for you.<eos> Mmm-hmm. Sarah is there for you.<eos> I don't know where Sarah is.<eos> I understand.<eos> These are, uh, decisions of the heart.<eos> Here's someone who might be able to help you with that.
♪ You'd have managed better If you'd had it planned<eos> ♪ Why'd you choose such a backwards time And such a strange land?<eos> If I come today.. ♪ I could have reached a whole nation<eos> ♪ Israel in 4 BC... Still no call, Donnie.<eos> ♪ Don't you get me wrong ♪ Don't you get me wrong<eos> ♪ Don't you get me wrong, now ♪ Don't you get me wrong ♪ I only want to know ♪ I only want to know<eos> ♪ I only want to know ♪ Jesus Christ<eos> ♪ Who are you?<eos> What have you sacrificed?<eos> Can I help you?
Art, come on, man. I mean, I...<eos> Come on. I know I crossed the line.<eos> It's dark stuff, but you can't let her do this to another cop.<eos> I crossed the line, too, Marty.<eos> For Beth.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Come on!<eos> Show me a scenario where Evie Cho stops coming after my family.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Look, I'll tell you what I know.
You seen Marty Duko lately? - No, why?<eos> - Guy blew his shift.<eos> Nobody knows where he is.<eos> No, I haven't seen him.<eos> Hope he's okay.<eos> Tabitha called me as soon as they broke out.<eos> Scared shitless.<eos> It wasn't a suicide.<eos> - No way.<eos> - I believe you.
You gotta find her before they do.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> We will.<eos> Detective.<eos> I'm at the scene.<eos> The one that got away, Kendra Dupree,<eos> I got a little tip she's headed to Tisdale.<eos> But you're not the only ones looking for her.<eos> Okay, could be worse.<eos> Er, they've charged you with possession, trafficking and importing.
Donnie, would you work with me here, please?<eos> Er, yeah. - Let's go to Niagara.<eos> - Good.<eos> All right, this is the last Steinbeck on the list.<eos> There's baby stuff.<eos> Just do it quick.<eos> I won't let you hurt my baby.<eos> Get away from him.<eos> We're not from Brightborn. - We... We don't want to hurt your kid.<eos> - I don't believe you. Listen very carefully.

You're recording this?<eos> And ready to upload it to every major news network.<eos> Let them live out their shortened lives.<eos> If even one of these children were discovered, decades of science would have been shelved.<eos> At the end of the day, euthanizing severely deformed newborns was the most humane way forward.<eos> Now if you'll excuse me.<eos> Wow, she did it.<eos> Well done.<eos> Welcome.<eos> What if I were to tell you that in a few short years, immune deficiencies could be eradicated?
Oh, God, I've missed you.<eos> I've missed you too, Ferdinand.<eos> Cosima's cut off in the Neolution power vacuum, and he calls in a beautician?<eos> Sweet move, right?<eos> Hello, Krystal.<eos> Hello, yourself.<eos> So what's this intel you've got on Delphine and Van Lier?<eos> It's life or death.<eos> Is it?<eos> 'Cause I basically don't believe anything you're saying right now.

And we told you that the less you know, the better. Remember?
Mom? I need help.<eos> Hello, Sarah.<eos> It's been aeons.<eos> No, don't worry.<eos> The whole family is just fine.<eos> - Hello, Rachel.<eos> - How did you fare?<eos> The science is secure.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Mr. Westmorland will see you now.
The fair maiden has been through a myriad of trials.<eos> They are our guests.<eos> Chill it up, "S."<eos> Chill it up!<eos> Jerry, you are a faithful steward, but your words leave me pitch-kettled.<eos> I understand your concern, Shiva.<eos> You haven't met Carol.<eos> Nor have I.<eos> But if she is a friend of Morgan, we shall consider her a friend of the realm until proven otherwise.<eos> She's doing better, thanks to you and your people, so...
We thought we did.<eos> It was just an outpost.<eos> H-How many of them were there?<eos> There were a lot.<eos> Maybe hundreds.<eos> Do they know the deal you made us take, Marsha?<eos> - It's Maggie.<eos> - No.<eos> And we didn't make you take the deal, Gregory.<eos> I-I-I'm happy we could patch you up.
You should go.<eos> Someone's going to see us.<eos> We're not doing anything.<eos> No. We're not.<eos> Can I wrap up my face now?<eos> No, you absolutely cannot.<eos> Why the hell not?<eos> !<eos> Look at this badass.<eos> You can't because I'm not done with you.
- What?<eos> Don't hold out on me.<eos> I'm not holdin' nothin'.<eos> But you promised to show me how to do eye makeup like you do.<eos> That.<eos> Right, yeah, right.<eos> Okay, I've been thinking, though, you gotta bring your own pencil, 'cause if you use mine, you could get, like, pinkeye or something.<eos> Do you have pinkeye?<eos> I don't think so, but I don't know, and you gotta be really careful around here.<eos> Okay, so listen, you go to the drug store, you get yourself a really good black eyeliner pencil and then I'll show you everything.
-Who the hell is that?<eos> -I have no idea.<eos> I told you I will handle this.<eos> Please.<eos> Go check on the sauce.<eos> I need to know that she's okay.<eos> I mean, I don't even know if she's alive.<eos> MCC is hiding behind its private corporate status and not complying with federal laws.<eos> Our lawsuit just goes on and on and she's lost in there!<eos> I assure you she is alive and well.
No, no, no guns.<eos> Put the gun away.<eos> This is a registered gun and you are trespassing on private property.<eos> You've been asked to leave and I'm going to ask you one more time.<eos> Please leave.<eos> Now.<eos> -Get back in your car, sir.<eos> -Oh, Jesus.<eos> You've got a gun on my girlfriend.<eos> Well, if your girlfriend joins you in your car, she'll be far away from the gun.
Previously on "12 Monkeys"...<eos> You sore about us?<eos> I trained her to survive.<eos> Dr. Eckland, you were not a part of my original reality.<eos> Well, that's gonna make it awkward when you come to bed.<eos> You like that I wasn't intimidated by you.
Yeah, there's some pretty trippy shit going on with that tea.<eos> They would, uh, drink it, and they would see him in their heads.<eos> I never tried it.<eos> Wasn't what I was there for.<eos> If it's the same hallucinogenic Ms. Goines consumes, it is possible.<eos> Could be a method of communication.<eos> It's properties allow your consciousness to drift outside time.<eos> - Mental time-travel.<eos> - Sign me up.<eos> I told you it wasn't a hallucination.
Jones.<eos> Doctor... you did this to me.<eos> The machine... you...<eos> you put me in there.<eos> What the hell is that thing?<eos> An early volunteer.<eos> He called himself Marshal.<eos> Volunteer?<eos> A scavenger we put in the machine.<eos> A test subject before you.
Just shut down the machine, and whatever stowaways are brought through, we take out one by one.<eos> It is not that simple, Mr. Deacon.<eos> The machine is in perpetual splinter sequence.<eos> Now that we have the array, we can stop the machine from dispersing more temporal energy.<eos> If we can not shut down the Core, that machine is going to turn this entire place into a crater a mile wide.<eos> Crater I understand.<eos> Listen, Mr. Deacon, you have to see that they shut it down.<eos> There is no telling what they may have already encountered out there.<eos> Okay.<eos> The rest of you get to the barracks.
With his ability to heal, he should be fine.<eos> Katarina, what happened to me?<eos> The tether we detected was not connected to another time-traveler physically but instead to a consciousness.<eos> It was a signal from somewhere in time.<eos> And your mind... Was the receiver.<eos> This is what The Witness did to you.<eos> He used you against us.<eos> He took control of you to sabotage the machine.<eos> I've prepared a series of injections that will purge whatever the 12 Monkeys left in your blood.<eos> He won't be able to do this to you again.
You agree.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> You know what they say, make plans and God laughs.<eos> I wish I could hear your voice.<eos> It's been a while since I've heard a friendly voice.<eos> Fire's getting low, I better sign off, I guess.<eos> Gotta recharge the batteries.<eos> I'll be up in the morning back assuming I don't blow my brains out tonight.<eos> I have an empty bottle of JD and there's clip left in my 45.<eos> I hope the night's better to you.
and there's a little "Z" on the other.<eos> I'm going to prison.<eos> So you like 'em?<eos> Yes, I love them.<eos> Thank you. They're beautiful.<eos> Now please leave.<eos> Molly?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> This is another property that I was wanting to show you.
Unlike Kellar Vineyard, which I highly recommend.<eos> Nancy, you're such a bummer.<eos> Broken Heart was recently sold to a group in California.<eos> I just don't see them turning around and selling so quickly. Ok, so let's offer them double.<eos> Double?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's all part of the plan, man.<eos> What do you say, Molly?<eos> Make it happen?<eos> I will do my best to deliver you Broken Heart Vineyards, Mr. Slade.
There is a face that I didn't want to see again.<eos> Jay Novak, my probation officer.<eos> Why would your friend Henry kill him? - He didn't.<eos> - The only other person in here.<eos> Yeah, but we know he's not a revenant, and the killer - has to be.<eos> - I still don't trust him.<eos> Why not?<eos> What are you two not telling me about your friend Henry?<eos> Guess I'll have to find out for myself.<eos> Wynonna's told me a lot about you.
And as a gentleman who cares about Wynonna, I will recommend that she quit you, lest she drown.<eos> Is Deputy Marshal Dolls laughing?<eos> I've never been so scared in my life.<eos> You know what I see in your eyes?<eos> A man who doesn't like small spaces.<eos> You been in prison?<eos> Solitary confinement, ooh.<eos> Was that fun?<eos> I have said all I intend to say.<eos> It's nice talking to you, "Hank."
Earp, when were you gonna tell me you were kicking it with the ghost of Doc Holliday?<eos> How did you find out?<eos> He's not a ghost. He's got eternal longevity.<eos> I was definitely gonna tell you before Christmas.<eos> Because then you could be each other's Secret Santas.<eos> How cute would that be?<eos> Poor dead sucker's wife just called, asking for Wynonna.<eos> !<eos> - Did I stutter?<eos> I said I wanted to talk to you, Wynonna, who's this fella?
That's reflective, right? OK.<eos> So what if his body is in water?<eos> What if he's using the water to project himself?<eos> I feel so smart right now!<eos> We gotta go. We need to go.<eos> No!<eos> You need to sit your ass down and rest.<eos> We got this, hombre.<eos> Look, she'll need back-up.<eos> You mess this up, and I will end you.
Look, you stay here, keep an eye on your little friend.<eos> If this is a trap and I die, gut him.<eos> So you weren't expecting guests?<eos> Why you wanna find some brokeback Nancy's boyfriend anyway?<eos> - Why is he your problem?<eos> - I made a promise. A deal.<eos> I'm trying to become the type of woman who keeps her word.<eos> Oh, you have a 'code'?<eos> That's cute.<eos> Don't make me hurt you.
Well, tea's getting cold, Holliday.<eos> What's up?<eos> I'm looking for a woman.<eos> Used to go by the name of Constance Clootie.<eos> Now she uses the alias C.C. Stone.<eos> - Bobo's lawyer?<eos> - And the witch responsible for my tenure at the bottom of that godforsaken well.<eos> Witch... the Stone Witch?<eos> - I don't know her by that name.<eos> - Why should I help you?
She looked like Herman. Very much like twins.<eos> Couldn't tell us apart.<eos> Right down to the goddamn tattoo.<eos> Laser removal.<eos> Greatest invention of the 20th century.<eos> Got 'em.<eos> The hunger!<eos> Herman! He was such a good boy.<eos> He always brought his Mama dinner.<eos> He won't be bringing you anything anymore.

The people upstairs want results.<eos> Don't call me again.<eos> Doc. Now's not a good time.<eos> Just so you know, my mission was for naught.<eos> Yeah, you said you'd get something on Bobo.<eos> I couldn't get close enough.<eos> You OK, there, partner?<eos> Our deal's off.<eos> I think it is time for you to leave, OK?<eos> I see what is happening to you.
Your past, your present, your future.<eos> Say, Iris, you look amazing.<eos> Thanks, Tony. His skin changed.<eos> It turned to metal.<eos> Tony might have been a bully, but he didn't deserve to die.<eos> Barry, you've always had someone to come home to.<eos> I can't help but wonder... Maybe we were meant to be together.<eos> You lost your powers?<eos> I gave them up to save Wally.<eos> I can re-create the circumstances to get you your speed back.
It's "The Walking Dead," but without higher brain function and with major rage issues.<eos> Still unsure if our brains are on the menu, though.<eos> - Which one?<eos> - Tony Woodward.<eos> The bully from school who turned into the metal man?<eos> That's not good, Cisco.<eos> History repeats itself.<eos> First as tragedy and then as farce.<eos> Wells, as a parent, believe me, I have nothing but sympathy for what you're going through.<eos> Listen to me closely when I say to you, we got a lot of fires burning at the same time, and if we all work together, we just might be able to put them out.
Oh, my God.<eos> Is that your car?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> That's my mom's car!<eos> So how do we know this is safe?<eos> Well, define "safe."<eos> Safe, as in my brain's not gonna melt.<eos> No. It's a simple feedback loop, Ramon, all right?<eos> When you vibe on Barry, your brain waves send me the necessary data to pinpoint whatever dimensional pocket or corner of the universe that Barry is stuck in.<eos> And then we electrically stimulate your prefrontal cortex while opening a breach, which gives you physical access to Barry and lets you be the beacon to guide him home.
Yes, and that someone is probably Zoom.<eos> There may be one more possibility.<eos> A few months ago, I saw Harrison Wells running out of my facility.<eos> I know it sounds crazy, but I'm certain it was him.<eos> Is there any way he could have anything to do with this?<eos> A few months ago?<eos> Sure.<eos> Now?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, there are a few more things that we could catch you up on, Dr. McGee.
Watching someone you love die?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Cait...<eos> Look, Barry.<eos> I know how cold and angry and distant that can make you.<eos> But when this happened to me, you were the one who kept me in check.<eos> You told me to stop and take a breath, and that's all we're telling you to do now.<eos> - I'm telling you I'm good.<eos> - Really?<eos> You're good?
I see Jay... Excuse me...<eos> Hunter... Stole your color scheme too.<eos> He took a lot of things that were mine, except for that.<eos> That's, um... That's all him.<eos> He said it was his father's from the war.<eos> Ironically, on my... on our Earth... This helmet stood for hope.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, maybe I can continue that sentiment, take something from him, for a change, make it my own.<eos> It suits you.

- Don't make me cry, Harry.<eos> I've done enough of that already.<eos> Detective Joe West...<eos> Harry.<eos> You have great kids.<eos> You take care of them. Same to you.<eos> You take care of that beautiful girl.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm a better man than I was when I got here,<eos> - and that's 'cause of you.
My inside man thinks telling half a secret makes him coy or something.<eos> But he did say that if I can pull this off, the desk is mine.<eos> And will you pull it off?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll get you a glass, then.<eos> This Houjin Lin operation was an eye opener, Robert.<eos> It corroborated some intelligence we picked up in Beijing.<eos> What kind of intelligence was that?<eos> You made some important people in Tel Aviv very happy.<eos> They want to set you up with a retirement account.

Where are you meeting her?<eos> I'll give you a report afterward. Yeah.<eos> You know, I-I don't know what you think your position is at this point.<eos> You're a ship without a harbor, buddy.<eos> You don't want to do this alone, Daniel.<eos> Particularly now.<eos> One more Shaw leak, and all our jobs are in jeopardy.<eos> You know, once upon a time, Shaw, he'd leak Agency misdeeds all over the world, but he has hit this station three times in a row.<eos> What's his beef against us?<eos> Maybe he has a problem with you.
Stand together?<eos> Anybody reaching for that many cliches sounds like they're hiding something.<eos> Oh, come on, Valerie.<eos> Are you hiding something, Steven?<eos> Jesus.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This is about Jemma Moore's desk, isn't it?<eos> This has nothing to do with losava, does it?<eos> Good Christ, Steven.<eos> You used to care about the human cost.

If they don't tie him up, he'll scratch his eyes out.<eos> The CIA tortured him for information he didn't have.<eos> When he was finally released, he lost his mind.<eos> He was a criminal, not a terrorist.<eos> He doesn't know him. Let's go.<eos> Julian.<eos> That's what your CIA does to people.<eos> That is the end point of your foreign policy... broken people tied to beds.<eos> This is why Thomas Shaw does what he does.<eos> Why do you think Shaw came to you in the first place?
- Hmm...<eos> Mitch's Life.<eos> - Now there's a title.<eos> I think if we attach the right talent, this could be a hit.<eos> You know who'd be great? BoJack Horseman.<eos> [laughing]<eos> Don't make me laugh, because I have a heart condition and it could kill me.<eos> Every little thing I bring that guy, he turns down.<eos> I think with the right project, BoJack could-- Bup, bup, bup!<eos> P.C., do I get you coffee and pick up your dry cleaning and buy you peek-a-boo negligees for strange women
- Thanks.<eos> Wait.<eos> Blarn, right?<eos> Yeah, from the coffee shop.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Is there coffee to "bariste"?<eos> I also do cater waiter gigs to make ends meet.<eos> You "bariste" and cater and waiter?<eos> [laughs] Triple threat.<eos> I should be bringing you the water.
Get his legs.<eos> We can't stay here much longer.<eos> We need to find shelter on land.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> We'll starve.<eos> He's too weak.<eos> We'd never get him past the beach.<eos> Alex, please.<eos> I owe him.<eos> Look, if you care for this boy, you have to consider what he needs, what is truly best for him.
It has food stores, gardens, water filtration for the well, reinforced concrete walls.<eos> And I have precious little time to get there.<eos> It is the only safe place, the only sound plan.<eos> You said San Diego was safe.<eos> No longer on the itinerary. Why lie?<eos> Why?<eos> Were you going to abandon us?<eos> How could I abandon seven people at once?<eos> Let me make it simple.<eos> We're coming with you, all of us.
Look at him!<eos> He's dying!<eos> Are you people really debating this?<eos> We can tow them.<eos> We can tow them to San Diego. - In their raft.<eos> - Travis, what part of what I'm saying...<eos> They don't come on the boat, okay?<eos> We're safe, they get a chance.<eos> Victor.<eos> We can give you food, water.
Everything I own is submerged and beyond salvage.<eos> Lucky man.<eos> I'm bankrupt.<eos> I have to begin again.<eos> I have to close half the ninth ward tomorrow.<eos> I got to look those people in the eye.<eos> So don't.<eos> I'm obligated to the business.<eos> And to my father.<eos> Sounds like you don't care for either.
Fringe real estate.<eos> In five years, I'll be back to where I was.<eos> But better dressed.<eos> - You don't want to wait that long, do you?<eos> - Don't condescend.<eos> - You shouldn't have to wait that long.<eos> You look like a man who can create beauty from something coarse.<eos> I'm a student of the fine.<eos> I like that.<eos> If you're not gonna call the police, then I thank you.
If you're not gonna call the police, then I thank you.<eos> If you want a return on your investment, I'll oblige.<eos> You'll pay me back.<eos> I intended to with interest.<eos> We can discuss the details.<eos> Tom, the man stole from you.<eos> Meet me downstairs.<eos> I'll be the one at the bar.<eos> Thank you... For the pardon.<eos> I didn't pardon you.
Sorry.<eos> Oh, you will be.<eos> That's the thing, señor.<eos> My brother, he's the nice one.<eos> But when he cuts me loose... I'm gonna take that daughter of yours apart.<eos> In my time, I've known men who inspire fear.<eos> Do you know what they have in common?<eos> They never say how frightening they are.<eos> Chris.<eos> You just gonna let him talk to you like that?
This provides leverage.<eos> So we're looking now for a cluster of five boats.<eos> Here. These five near the coast.<eos> Could be they're fishing boats. They tend to travel together.<eos> Okay, so that's where we go.<eos> Qué es esto?<eos> Why are we heading north? - Turn it back.<eos> - I'm sorry, I can't do that.<eos> Señora, I made arrangements.<eos> Do you understand?
Señora, I made arrangements.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> We're gonna miss our window to crossing...<eos> We're not crossing anywhere without my family.<eos> Are you gonna make me be the one to tell her?<eos> There's no telling her anything.<eos> Your people are gone.<eos> There's no getting them back.<eos> I need half a day.<eos> I could have left you in the water. Should I have?
So I know what it costs.<eos> It cost a part of me.<eos> How do I get that part back?<eos> You don't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry for all of this.<eos> We can... we can be more than what we've become, can't we?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Wait.<eos> What happens to you?
Wait.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> Someone said "asshole" in Spanish.<eos> Luis?<eos> Everyone stay inside.<eos> Por favor, no!<eos> Esperame, esperame!<eos> - Wait, wait. - Get back inside!<eos> It's okay. Shh. Shh.<eos> Let me help you.
- I'm very hungry, yeah.<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> Dinner's not till 8:00.<eos> If I give you some pozole, you promise not to tell the others?<eos> I would do just about anything for some pozole.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - How is it?<eos> - It's amazing.<eos> Luis... he was asking for you when he... you were on his mind.

Hey.<eos> Your friend, he won't rest.<eos> He'll come back for you.<eos> You don't believe?<eos> If I did, I'd be with him right now.<eos> He will return.<eos> They return, but they're not the same.<eos> You're not the same.<eos> And they hate you for it.<eos> What's wrong with you?
She's outside.<eos> - Papa, it's going to be okay.<eos> - What are you doing? Did you hear what I said?<eos> This place is evil!<eos> - If we stay, we die.<eos> - We have no place to go, Papa.<eos> Wait!<eos> Papa!<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> I know what he meant to you.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You are dying.<eos> Can you feel it?<eos> Speak while you still have words.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I have nothing to tell you.
Oh, Jesus Christ!<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> I didn't do this!<eos> Yes you did.<eos> You're a murderer.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No, no!<eos> I'm truly sorry to make you watch this, Ash.<eos> I simply can't find any other way, to impress upon you how increasingly violent, and unstable your behavior has become.
No!<eos> No!<eos> No, no!<eos> I'm truly sorry to make you watch this, Ash.<eos> I simply can't find any other way, to impress upon you how increasingly violent, and unstable your behavior has become.<eos> That's not me.<eos> I'm afraid it is, Ash.<eos> As I'm afraid I've failed you.<eos> Transferring you to another facility.<eos> One that's better equipped to deal with patients like you.
And they will hang you for looking at them wrong.<eos> Welcome to Marco's.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Vamos.<eos> Come on, let's shop.<eos> - I'll tell you right here, right now, the way to make a perfect martini.
Sí, sí, no more Oxy. Yeah, you're gonna run out of Oxy.<eos> No more Oxy, man.<eos> Tell him.<eos> _<eos> Tell him that there is nothing left.<eos> Nothing left.<eos> You have your stash, but at the rate you're going through it, man, that's gonna last, what, a few weeks?<eos> And, yeah, you can find a substitute, sure, but that crave's gonna get worse and worse and worse and your sister needs her family.<eos> Familia.<eos> Yeah, they need it. You let your sister go for one week without it, you're gonna pray she turns just so you can kill her.
And, yeah, you can find a substitute, sure, but that crave's gonna get worse and worse and worse and your sister needs her family.<eos> Familia.<eos> Yeah, they need it. You let your sister go for one week without it, you're gonna pray she turns just so you can kill her.<eos> You need Oxy.<eos> We have Oxy.<eos> But now, if you want it, we want another cart of water.<eos> Uno mas.<eos> What?<eos> They don't know where our colonia is and we can't let them know.<eos> They ever followed you before?
He's always good for a laugh."<eos> I should've known better than to get my hopes up. Yeah.<eos> We're looking for one of your strippers, Skinny Gina?<eos> We don't employ strippers here.<eos> Whale World is a family establishment, where children of all ages have a fun, sexy time.<eos> Hey, Skinny Gina, get that sweet tail over here!<eos> You got a customer.<eos> You enjoy yourself.<eos> Well, hello, land mammals.<eos> We're just here to ask you some questions about your friend Nadia.
I'm just saying, but pretend I'm not here. - How would you dance then?<eos> - Like a stripper, probably.<eos> Listen, we have some bad news.<eos> Your friend Nadia is dead.<eos> - Not surprised.<eos> - You're not?<eos> A lot of girls like her come through here.<eos> Sweet, vulnerable.<eos> This place takes 'em and makes 'em a lot of promises.<eos> They say they're gonna take care of you, make you big like Shamu.
Okay, but you can move them, right?<eos> With Hector.<eos> I unlock one hall, I draw them inside, lock them in.<eos> It is our defense.<eos> Well, you can do that.<eos> - It's not that simple.<eos> - It is that simple.<eos> My mother needs me.<eos> Look, I have to go.<eos> Did you hear me? I'm not here to hurt you.
- Stop doing that. Nobody should be thinking about the things I say.<eos> - I love Karen. But does she complete me?<eos> - Taneisha, nobody completes anybody.<eos> That's not a real thing.<eos> If you're lucky enough to find someone you can halfway tolerate, sink your nails in and don't let go, no matter what.<eos> - So, what, I should just settle?<eos> - Yes, thank you, exactly. Settle.<eos> Because otherwise you're just gonna get older, and harder, and more alone.<eos> And you're gonna do everything you can to fill that hole, with friends, and your career, and meaningless sex, but the hole doesn't get filled.<eos> One day, you're gonna look around and you're going to realize that everybody loves you, but nobody likes you.
- Is that a lot?<eos> - Dry goods, canned goods.<eos> Yes, a lot. Enough for months.<eos> But these people want us gone.<eos> They still want me dead.<eos> Oscar!<eos> What do you want?<eos> - Are you Oscar?<eos> - I'm not. Well, we need to talk to him.<eos> He doesn't need to talk to you.
Let them in.<eos> Are we sure about this?<eos> I'm tired of running, Victor.<eos> Take a break if you have to.<eos> No, I'm okay.<eos> Hey, you want to work yourself into the ground, be my guest, but I don't hand out honor badges and I don't pay overtime.<eos> So what happened?<eos> Did Luciana not tell you?<eos> She told me she had.<eos> She just said that you were bitten and that you didn't turn and she has a lot of faith in you.
There's opportunity here for all of us.<eos> It's an empty hotel.<eos> What we have, we'll run out of.<eos> There's nothing.<eos> You haven't been beyond these walls, we have. You haven't seen.<eos> This place has everything.<eos> You can harvest water, grow food, fortify the gates.<eos> But we have to clear the dead.<eos> We can make this place a home.<eos> If we help you, that woman cannot stay.
You quiet is not fine.<eos> You negotiated well.<eos> You didn't need any assistance.<eos> You may have even earned a few converts.<eos> Not with the mother.<eos> No, not with the mother.<eos> Her grief is driving her.<eos> We need them.<eos> We lose any of these fights, we lose a home.<eos> Victor, what's wrong with you?
- Mom!<eos> - Give me your hand!<eos> We're okay.<eos> Come in.<eos> I was too tired to sleep.<eos> Come in.<eos> You're reading a dictionary?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got to learn to talk to someone that isn't you or Alejandro.
Death parted you.<eos> Your vows give you leave.<eos> I don't know what I am without her.<eos> You'll never be the same.<eos> But then... one morning you'll start thinking like someone new.<eos> Someone you don't know yet.<eos> The person that comes after.<eos> I liked who I was.<eos> So did I.<eos> Let me help you.
How are you?<eos> Good work yesterday.<eos> Get out of my way, please.<eos> [sighing]<eos> We have a situation on line two. Name's Horseman.<eos> BoJack Horseman.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> Hello, good morning, and I say this with 100 percent sincerity...<eos> How can I help you?
I'll take it from here.<eos> Hello, good morning, and I say this with 100 percent sincerity...<eos> How can I help you?<eos> I never subscribed to the L.A. Gazette.<eos> I do not read the L.A. Gazette.<eos> I have called this number so many times to stop sending it to me.<eos> Yet every morning, I open my door on a new edition of the L.A. Gazette.<eos> It's like I'm in a boring episode of The Twilight Zone.<eos> Sir, we are going to unravel this mystery.<eos> But before we dig in, is there anything I can get you?

Nope.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I need to go watch a sport.<eos> Great idea.<eos> The worst part is things have actually been going really well with Todd.<eos> Our friendship is in a really good place.<eos> Last week he said,<eos> "Did you know the wiener dog is neither a wiener nor a dog?"<eos> Instead of saying, "Shut up, Todd," I said, "Okay."<eos> [The Closer] So, why did you sleep with Emily?<eos> Do you think that part of you was getting uncomfortable with that closeness?
Oh, god.<eos> Don't die on us, all right? Your confidence is overwhelming.<eos> Why don't you keep them company, Oscar?<eos> A year and a half, but maybe I can help.<eos> I need to open this up.<eos> - Okay. - Sorry.<eos> I need antiseptic, alcohol, gauze.<eos> Antibiotics if you can find them, okay?<eos> There is-- there is a first aid kit in my other room.<eos> Ilene blames you.
It is my place.<eos> I care for this place.<eos> Listen, waiting for faith to work or for the dead to wash the world clean, like, the danger is now.<eos> It's coming, man.<eos> - It's out there.<eos> - You believe in the dead.<eos> You believe in them to protect us because you have such little faith in me.<eos> You both have such little faith in me.<eos> I have faith, okay?<eos> Luciana has faith in you.
- You believe in the dead.<eos> You believe in them to protect us because you have such little faith in me.<eos> You both have such little faith in me.<eos> I have faith, okay?<eos> Luciana has faith in you.<eos> You attacked her loyalty.<eos> I never asked to be the one to make these decisions, but I am.<eos> I concern myself with our survival.<eos> That's all I care about.<eos> So you want me to just follow you blindly?
How do I know you?<eos> We've met before.<eos> Actually, not yet.<eos> Not for you, anyway.<eos> Please let me go.<eos> My husband, he's found some...<eos> Book of the Dead, and... I don't know, it's... changed him somehow.<eos> Where's the book now?<eos> I have no idea, I'm chained to the damn wall!<eos> I can help you find it.
It's him.<eos> Welcome to my cabin in the woods.<eos> It is.<eos> It's really nice.<eos> Looks like he's got a hot little number on the side, too.<eos> Good for him.<eos> I mean, This can be yours.<eos> Men are such pigs.<eos> He's going to torture her, just like he tortured me.<eos> Professor Knowby, I can't thank you enough for the extra credit.
Now, before we start these translations, there's... just something I need you to help me with.<eos> Please, there's no time.<eos> The key!<eos> No.<eos> Not until I know where that book is.<eos> Now spill.<eos> Unlock me first.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> He always keeps it with him, so the book is here now.<eos> Just let me go, and I'll show you!
- Not everyone is interested in your wist.<eos> - Okay, BoJack.<eos> - You smell nice.<eos> - Thanks, BoJack.<eos> [Carolyn laughs] Okay, gotta go.<eos> I'm about to meet my most important client.<eos> - I know you're not really on the phone.<eos> - Bye, Mr. President.<eos> Give my love to your basketball friends.<eos> You too.
Chris...<eos> He's sick.<eos> I couldn't see it.<eos> He's my son.<eos> Look, I'm sorry that I didn't believe you.<eos> I'm sorry that i-- I didn't protect you better.<eos> I should have.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm offering you this.
We have fared better here than out in the world.<eos> Better than we fared even before this all started.<eos> For most of us this is the first time we have a place, a family.<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> Our father, who art in heaven.<eos> Hallowed be thy name.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Welcome to America.<eos> I'll tell you everything, all right?
I will, man, but I can't think straight with my arm like this.<eos> Yeah, can you fix my man's shoulder, Travis?<eos> Please? Can you do that?<eos> Trav?<eos> It's okay, maddie.<eos> - I just need to know. Okay?<eos> - Yeah, you'll be sore a few days, but that's it.<eos> Now, tell me.<eos> What happened to my son?<eos> Look, we'll tell you what happened. All right?
- What did you do?<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> - Tell me what happened!<eos> - Travis, stop!<eos> Tell me the truth. - Travis.<eos> - Please!<eos> Get the keys. Get the goddamn keys! Tell me!<eos> Where's my son?<eos> All right, Travis, we'll tell you, man.
- Great. Great people.<eos> - All right.<eos> See you.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - See you.<eos> You know, we have more to discuss.<eos> Tonight is our regular pizza night.<eos> We could turn it into a "welcome to the neighborhood" get-together.<eos> I can give you the one-on-one on the schools in the area. It could be fun.
Well...<eos> It was just an ugly box when we bought it.<eos> Holy cow!<eos> I actually based the entire design on Charlotte's childhood home in the south of France.<eos> So is that what you do?<eos> You're an architect?<eos> I've... I've lived many lives, Alex.<eos> I've been born, died and resurrected so many times, I can't even tell you.<eos> But...<eos> Can I show you what my passion is now?
You know what?<eos> Hold on, I just want to say one thing.<eos> I want to say one thing.<eos> You know, one of our main worries coming here was that we wouldn't be able to meet new people or make new friends,<eos> and I have to say that tonight you guys really put that to bed.<eos> - And, and, and...<eos> - It's true. - It is true.<eos> - It's true. He's...<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I just want to say, thank you - for having us into your beautiful home.
- What do you think?<eos> This is a French house. Yeah, it's a French house.<eos> Well... No... We'll just get out of here.<eos> We'll just get out of here. - We want you to stay. - It's fine.<eos> We want it.<eos> We want it.<eos> - I mean...<eos> - Is that what...<eos> - Yes. - Settled then.<eos> All right. I'm not done with you two yet.
Well... No... We'll just get out of here.<eos> We'll just get out of here. - We want you to stay. - It's fine.<eos> We want it.<eos> We want it.<eos> - I mean...<eos> - Is that what...<eos> - Yes. - Settled then.<eos> All right. I'm not done with you two yet.<eos> And as for you two kids.<eos> You come with me upstairs because I have got a surprise for you.
We want it.<eos> - I mean...<eos> - Is that what...<eos> - Yes. - Settled then.<eos> All right. I'm not done with you two yet.<eos> And as for you two kids.<eos> You come with me upstairs because I have got a surprise for you.<eos> Who likes surprises?<eos> - Me! - All right!<eos> Give me 20 minutes and I will give you parental bliss.
Right. - You know?<eos> - It's always a touchy thing, though, because you don't want to step on another parent's turf.<eos> Right. But, I mean, we felt...<eos> You know.<eos> I was a little bit hesitant.<eos> I saw what was happening, but there is not a kid in the world that can say no to incense, stargazer, and a little bit of the...<eos> I mean, we've learned something tonight.<eos> It was pretty amazing.<eos> - He's a magician.<eos> - Can I tell you something, first of all?
I want you to stop moping around like a little bitch, you take that thing, you own it, and you get the fuck out there and you show me what the fuck you're made out of.<eos> You're a stud.<eos> You're a studhorse, Alex.<eos> - Don't you ever forget that.<eos> - Okay. - All right? - Okay.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> - Yeah. I'm a studhorse.<eos> You're a studhorse.<eos> Ladies and ladies, can I have your full attention please?<eos> Girls, get the biggest towel you got, 'cause your pussies are about to be dripping wet.
Now they did.<eos> - Yeah, all right.<eos> - Get up.<eos> - Hey, guys...<eos> - Hey!<eos> You don't write, you don't call, you're breaking my heart.<eos> Sorry, I'm just kidding, dumb joke.<eos> - How are ya?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Good. Yeah. - How are you guys?
- How are ya?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Good. Yeah. - How are you guys?<eos> It's good, it's really...<eos> We're in therapy.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah. Sorry to be the one to cut the crap here, but...<eos> Basically we've decided to give the marriage another chance.<eos> We've been able to sort through a ton of stuff.<eos> That sounds great. We've got you guys to thank for that.

We've got you guys to thank for that.<eos> - Without that experience we'd be lost, really.<eos> Thank you, you walked us down the aisle to this moment.<eos> It was a crazy experience.<eos> - But it was, you know... - Yeah. - Yeah.<eos> - It was valuable.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's good to see you guys.
The Mountain.<eos> Meryn Trant.<eos> Cersei.<eos> Walder Frey.<eos> The Mountain.<eos> Meryn Trant.<eos> Must be good food if it's crowded.<eos> Ale?<eos> Ale?<eos> Before we left, a maester gave you a raven scroll.
Too many.<eos> My lady, I don't think this is the right...<eos> - Ready the horses.<eos> - We only have one horse.<eos> Find more.<eos> Do you like the taste?<eos> I don't see what all the fuss is about.<eos> Why do men love it so much?<eos> It gives some men courage.<eos> Does it give you courage?

He was murdered by a shadow.<eos> A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon.<eos> A shadow?<eos> With the face...<eos> This woman swore to protect Renly.<eos> She failed.<eos> She swore to protect your mother.<eos> She failed.<eos> Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guarding Lady Sansa?<eos> Why should you have any say in her affairs?
This is my betrothed, Lollys.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> Run along, love.<eos> Beautiful young bride you've chosen.<eos> When were you planning on getting married?<eos> - Just get on with it.<eos> - On with what?<eos> What you're here for.<eos> There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.<eos> It's very good for you.
Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War.<eos> No man living better deserves the title.<eos> That is kind of you to say.<eos> I would like to hear it from the king himself.<eos> The king is very busy at this moment.<eos> He should be here learning what it means to rule.<eos> He is learning.<eos> On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf.<eos> I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother.<eos> And to you.
They could strike at him by striking at you.<eos> Gilly wouldn't do that.<eos> You have no idea what people will do.<eos> All your books and you still don't know.<eos> I ordered Mance Rayder burned at the stake.<eos> You prevented that order from being carried out.<eos> You showed mercy to Mance Rayder.<eos> A king's word is law.<eos> Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers.<eos> Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If they don't fear you, they don't follow you.

You?<eos> No.<eos> Only one of their own.<eos> Do you know this wretched girl, Lyanna Mormont?<eos> The Lord Commander's niece.<eos> Lady of Bear Island and a child of 10.<eos> I asked her to commit her house to my cause.<eos> That's her response.<eos> "Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."<eos> That amuses you?
He thinks you're a traitor.<eos> What's your life going to be like here at the Wall with Thorne in command?<eos> Unpleasant, I expect.<eos> Your bravery made him look weak.<eos> He'll punish you for it.<eos> I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.<eos> I don't doubt it, Your Grace.<eos> But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.<eos> I pledged them my life, my honor, my sword.<eos> I don't know what I have left to give you.
- I said...<eos> - Turn around and go.<eos> Turn around and go.<eos> That's a nice little sword.<eos> Worth 100 pigeons, a sword like that.<eos> Nothing's worth anything to dead men.<eos> Quickly, go!<eos> Go!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Why were they scared of you?
Why were they scared of you?<eos> You lost this.<eos> You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.<eos> There isn't.<eos> A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.<eos> Well, who are you, then?<eos> No one.<eos> And that is who a girl must become.<eos> She doesn't belong here.<eos> And no matter how many of you traitors call her "Mhysa", she will never be your mother.
A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.<eos> Well, who are you, then?<eos> No one.<eos> And that is who a girl must become.<eos> She doesn't belong here.<eos> And no matter how many of you traitors call her "Mhysa", she will never be your mother.<eos> Why?<eos> For you, Mhysa.<eos> You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied.<eos> I set you free, as you did all of us.
The Harpy's life was not yours to take.<eos> Once, the Masters were the law-<eos> And now you are the law.<eos> The law is the law.<eos> Take him.<eos> Mhysa!<eos> Mhysa!<eos> Mhysa!<eos> She should have cut off the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.<eos> Which is what I keep telling her to do to you.

These are serious accusations<eos> The word of a horse thief and that of two businessmen.<eos> Who will the judge believe?<eos> Milk?<eos> Sugar?<eos> I'm afraid for 33... and Milan.<eos> Milan, 33. I told you it meant something.<eos> - Yeah...<eos> You babble in your sleep.<eos> - I should have told you earlier.
Okay? Right now.<eos> Come on, let's go. Girls.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Aunt Dorothy, will you keep an eye on them?<eos> Why me?<eos> I never liked kids, even when I was one.<eos> Please.<eos> Oh, all right. All right!<eos> Come on, guys, I'm gonna teach you how to make peppermint schnapps.
Tom, God!<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> And Beth?<eos> Okay.<eos> She wasn't at Derek's, but that doesn't mean anything.<eos> She may have found somewhere safe.<eos> So, she's still out there.<eos> Yes.<eos> And we will find her, I promise.<eos> But I had to make sure you guys were safe. I had to get Howard back...
Let's get cozy on the couch.<eos> Go get your sister, Stevie.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> Come on.<eos> We'll find her, I promise.<eos> "And lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them.<eos> "And the glory of the Lord shone round about them.<eos> "And they were so afraid.<eos> "And the angel said unto them,<eos> "'Fear not. For behold, I bring you tidings of great joy..."'
Jordan?<eos> Stevie?<eos> Beth?<eos> Beth, you up there?<eos> Stevie?<eos> Jordan?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Everyone's freaking out.<eos> Come up here and I'll show you.
That?<eos> No.<eos> Are you nearly done?<eos> I was done ages ago.<eos> I'm completely done.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, Jenna.<eos> Yeah, great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And you?
Why?<eos> Frank's sperm must be too tired.<eos> Or he doesn't love me.<eos> Now, I don't want kids anymore.<eos> It's really beautiful here.<eos> I've never managed to do anything nice with the house.<eos> Even if I move the furniture...<eos> It's pointless.<eos> When you have brats leaving their shit everywhere.<eos> And we don't bother you?
Dreams are strange, aren't they?<eos> What's hidden inside us.<eos> I dreamt about this big clock.<eos> And my dick...<eos> I mean, my penis was on an hour.<eos> The big hand was a big razor blade showing 11:55.<eos> I don't dream.<eos> I don't have the time.<eos> Shame!<eos> Aren't you cold?
- OK! Damn!<eos> I'll go!<eos> Anything you want!<eos> Aren't you cold?<eos> He doesn't love me.<eos> He never loved me.<eos> That's why I'm always pregnant.<eos> It's possible.<eos> I think you're awful.<eos> Both of you.
Five miles.<eos> Hey, Carol.<eos> Carol: I'm here.<eos> We're halfway there.<eos> Just wanted to check the range.<eos> Everybody's holding tight.<eos> We've made it 500 miles. Maybe this can be the easy part.<eos> Rick: Got to think we're due.<eos> Give us 20 minutes to check in.<eos> Carol: We don't hear from you, we'll come looking.
But I did what you told me to.<eos> You're okay. Just hold on.<eos> I'll get them. I'll get...<eos> I'll get them.<eos> At least 68 citizens of the republic have been killed in four deadly attacks along the main coastal district.<eos> The group has continued their campaign of random violence, moving across the countryside unfettered with the republic's military forces in disarray.<eos> I tried to tell you.<eos> I tried to tell you, man.<eos> You're the kind of guy who saves babies.<eos> You think Gareth would have been able to follow you guys if you'd have just put a bullet in my brain?
There something you nee?<eos> He has a camp nearby.<eos> He wants us to auition for membership.<eos> I wish there was another wor.<eos> Auition makes it soun like we're some kin of a ance troupe.<eos> That's only on Friay nights.<eos> Um, an it's not a camp.<eos> It's a community. I think you all woul make valuable aitions.<eos> But it's not my call.<eos> My job is to convince you all to follow me back home.
I saw your pantry.<eos> You guys seem to o pretty well.<eos> Yeah, well, ha some training before this. ROTC.<eos> Was nearing lieutenant when this shit blew in.<eos> - My a i ROTC.<eos> - He in't make it?<eos> Nah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry a lot these ays.<eos> Come on, I'll show you the ropes.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry. Noah:<eos> They're coming.<eos> Okay, it was... it was us.<eos> The others before. They didn't panic. We did.<eos> It was us.<eos> No.<eos> Noah: They're here!<eos> That how it works with you?
Over here.<eos> Come get me.<eos> Come get me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come and get me.<eos> Come on, Eugene.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey. I need you both...
Stop it!<eos> Stop it right now.<eos> You touch them again and I'll kill you.<eos> Damn it, Rick!<eos> I said stop.<eos> Or what?<eos> You gonna kick me out?<eos> Put that gun down, Rick.<eos> You still don't get it.<eos> None of you do!
It got insie on its own.<eos> They always will...<eos> the ea an the living, because we're in here.<eos> An the ones out there they'll hunt us.<eos> They'll fin us.<eos> They'll try to use us.<eos> They'll try to kill us.<eos> But we'll kill them.<eos> We'll survive.<eos> I'll show you how.

I was thinking how many of you o I have to kill to save your lives?
Tell me about your work.<eos> You wanna know if I'm responsible for what happened.<eos> - Aren't you?<eos> - Look, I did my job.<eos> Believe me. I don't have to believe you. What matters is that they believe you.<eos> Now, tell me about your work.<eos> I'm the producer.<eos> I find the story. I put the team together. I write and cut the piece.<eos> I work at 60 Minutes.<eos> Which one of you ordered the duck?
Well, I don't think that I had the right... to have the power that I had. To choose who was gonna go to Vietnam and who was not gonna go to Vietnam.<eos> That's a power in some instances when I look at those names... of maybe determining life or death, and that's not a power I wanna have.<eos> Too strong or not, to say you're ashamed of it now?<eos> Oh, I think that that would be an appropriate thing.<eos> I'm very, very sorry.<eos> What's it running?<eos> It's 60 minutes, at least three over.<eos> Some of the document stuffs a little slow, you can trim there.<eos> How about flipping it, open with Barnes, then do the documents? Keep it chronological.<eos> You've got three hours.
I figured she would be the producer of the show.<eos> She and that Dan Rather have been working on this... ever since Bush was elected.<eos> She should really be looking at George...<eos> Hello?<eos> You can't talk to the press anymore, Don.<eos> - Who is this?<eos> - You know who this is.<eos> Just for once in your life, be decent.<eos> I'm expressing my opinion.<eos> I thought you reporters were all about that.
Are you all right?<eos> Do you need a huggie?<eos> No, I do not!<eos> I'm not five!<eos> Hope, it's okay, you can feel bad.<eos> There's nothing wrong with...<eos> Stop treating me like I'm fucking five!<eos> Hey.<eos> Yo.<eos> Which one of you guys want to buy me a drink?
Hon...<eos> Maggie.<eos> Honey, you don't mean that. Right?<eos> You sure?<eos> Go with your gut.<eos> Hey, Maggie.<eos> Why don't you show Miss Greggory your picture?<eos> Okay?<eos> All right.<eos> Well, I'm just gonna leave you two ladies alone then.
I'm like, fuck you, fuck her, fuck them<eos> Fuck a medal, I got Hope, Blonde money in<eos> I'm like, fuck you, fuck her, fuck them<eos> Fuck a medal, I got Hope Blonde money in<eos> 'Cause we don't wanna fuck with you No<eos> Making money, cashing out like I'm supposed to<eos> We don't wanna fuck with you You got Fanta?<eos> Everybody in the mall know my name<eos> It's Hope Ann<eos> Awesome boss bitch music Mission accomplished ...give a fuck how you feel
You are still a community leader in Bailey Downs.<eos> And you know what? Maybe in exchange for just a smidge of campaigning, I could help revive your monthly potluck.<eos> Urn... I heard you plan to tinker electoral boundaries. Taking Bailey Downs out of the Glendale school district.<eos> Well, uh, that's just one possibility, yes.<eos> That would mean my kids have to change schools.<eos> So instead of supporting you, I've been thinking of running against you.<eos> Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Wow. So best of luck to you.<eos> Okay, up you go. Everybody on.
Not even my sisters.<eos> Welcome to the Dyad Institute.<eos> Enjoy your oophorectomy.<eos> Ferdinand? Welcome.<eos> Delphine Cormier.<eos> Dr Cormier, yes.<eos> Rachel.<eos> Nice to see you again, Ferdinand.<eos> I'm so sorry, I'm between flights.<eos> I need you both.
I just don't believe that Helena is a priority for Delphine.<eos> We have to make our own moves.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> We can't rely on anybody but ourselves.<eos> We should go after her, the poor thing.<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no. You tell Sarah I don't want you doing anything like this ever again.<eos> I gotta go,<eos> Be careful, Sarah.<eos> Hey, I love you guys.
I knew something was off.<eos> - That's when you came to talk to us.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You, Kevin, Meg.<eos> Your mother wasn't there.<eos> She was out of town.<eos> I always thought it was an odd time to take a trip.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Well, you know, she had the inn to manage, and tourist season coming up.<eos> Anyway, talking to you three, it became clear because you had all told the same story.
I swear to you, I will never leave this city ever again.<eos> Well, I won't let you.<eos> - Where's Phillip?<eos> - Oh, he's taken the baggage and is getting us settled in our new apartment.<eos> Algie.<eos> Algie, look who it is.<eos> Cornelia?<eos> Oh, he's as surprised as I am.<eos> She's back for good.<eos> Come with me. I have something to show you.
The exercise, Sheldon.<eos> Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?<eos> I'm not going.<eos> Would you like to know why?<eos> Uh, you're sad about not getting anything done last night, so you're gonna sit around and pout about it?<eos> Boy, I'm not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.<eos> I invented a game. You want to play?<eos> Sure.<eos> It's called "Emily or Cinnamon""<eos> I give you actual quotes I've heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.
He was testing me, too.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> And how could a chimp even solve that?<eos> That was impossible.<eos> Really?<eos> You couldn't get it out?<eos> Thank you.<eos> AMY: Wow, the store looks great.<eos> So you guys were testing us both?<eos> What is the matter with you?
What? !<eos> Okay, I learned my lesson.<eos> Making fun of people is wrong!<eos> I haven't learned my lesson. Play it!<eos> Play it!<eos> I'm Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California.<eos> You look like a talking cupcake!<eos> And you should pick me for Miss California Quiznos 1999, because I want to...<eos> Tell you what I want, what I really really want<eos> I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want
Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy.<eos> And then they finish it off by staring into each other's eyes for four minutes.<eos> Oh, that's nonsense.<eos> I proclaimed my love for you.<eos> And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis.<eos> Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night.<eos> Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?<eos> What? I don't need science to win her heart.<eos> I have my family's wealth for that.<eos> I'm telling you, you can't create love in a few hours.

I'd love her to get behind it.<eos> Hey. Hey. - Hey.<eos> Hello.<eos> You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASA's been working on?<eos> Well, they're looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life.<eos> Oh. When I encountered alien life, I-I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.<eos> All right, you can't breathe our air without an inhaler, he's allergic to Earth nuts, but I'm the alien.<eos> Anyway, I'm among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system. Excellent.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> Good for you. And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.
Well, I try to.<eos> I certainly wouldn't be a scientist if you hadn't been my role model.<eos> Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter? !<eos> It was L. Frank Baum who said,<eos> "No thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure."<eos> Wow, I'm boring myself.<eos> Sorry, I can't see any of your faces right now, but I bet they look like this.<eos> Uh, you know, I-I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it.<eos> Maybe high school's great if you look like this but I didn't even feel like I existed at that school.<eos> And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way.
By the way, 19;<eos> and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you.<eos> Maybe you don't have any friends.<eos> And guess what?<eos> That's okay.<eos> While all the popular kids are off doing-- whatever, I don't know what they were doing 'cause I was never there...<eos> I'll-I'll tell you later.<eos> My point is, while you're spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what you're really doing is becoming interesting.<eos> And when people finally do notice you, they're gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought.<eos> And for those of you who were popular in high school, it's over, sorry.
Leonard, what time does your mom's plane get in?<eos> I don't know-- some time tomorrow morning.<eos> Don't you want to know for sure? No need to.<eos> As soon as she flies into California airspace, I'll feel a disturbance in the Force.<eos> It's so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.
I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.<eos> I'm tapping out.<eos> Leonard?<eos> I'm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.<eos> Oh, no, not just a season.<eos> If I'm in, I'm in for the whole run, even if the quality declines.<eos> Smallville almost wrecked you.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.<eos> Wait, what is wrong with you two?
Is there no one here?<eos> Someone shot at me!<eos> I've had it.<eos> I give up. - You!<eos> You... will not give up.<eos> No. Germans never give up.<eos> They finish what they've started.<eos> To the end.<eos> I admire you, Germans. I do.<eos> The best books in the world were written by you.
Hi, Siri.<eos> - No'? Fine.<eos> How's the sleeping mat?<eos> It just took me a while to figure out how to get the air out again.<eos> It can be inflated?<eos> They say people make pilgrimages to wash away their sins.<eos> But I have the feeling many are here to commit sins.<eos> They talk about enlightenment, how great the Way is and what it does to them, but, honestly, I don't understand most people I meet here.<eos> I don't understand most people I meet anywhere.<eos> Don't any of you have doubts about what you're doing here?
"You mustn't quit or everything will have been in vain."<eos> It has all been in vain anyway.<eos> Her father wanted her to stay in hospital and get further treatment.<eos> But she'd had enough. All she wanted was to come here.<eos> So I came with her.<eos> My husband was furious when he found out we'd gone.<eos> I wish I'd listened to him.<eos> Maybe we could've had some more time with her.<eos> I thought maybe...<eos> If I felt now how I will feel tomorrow, I'd never have eaten and drunk this much with you, and that would've been a shame.
But I think...<eos> I think he was talking to you.<eos> - Me?<eos> - I mean, who else?<eos> For one hot second I thought maybe he was catting around...<eos> No, he wouldn't do that.<eos> No, I know. I know that.<eos> But you?<eos> He knew he could call you anytime he had a problem.<eos> You were thick as thieves, the two of you.
Thereitis !<eos> Open the gates.<eos> It was a failure.<eos> It wasn't.<eos> I went to save them.<eos> I failed.<eos> You didn't fail him.<eos> Or him.<eos> Or her.<eos> Every one of them is alive because of you and no one else.
"The Dance of Dragons:<eos> A True Telling" by Grand Maester Munkun.<eos> Now that sounds like a proper story.<eos> Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar.<eos> He polished his shield for a week so that it was like a mirror.<eos> And he crouched behind it and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see its own reflection.<eos> But the dragon saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield.<eos> And burnt him to a crisp.<eos> Thus ending the dragon-slaying career of Ser Byron Swann.<eos> I made you something, Princess.
So that he can have company?<eos> Of course I will.<eos> But why am I getting a present?<eos> Because you deserve it.<eos> My son was always on me, trying to teach me to read.<eos> Gods, I was stubborn about it.<eos> Made it this far without reading.<eos> Seemed to me I could make it to the grave.<eos> Wish I'd listened to him.<eos> This is my own poor way of saying thank you.
I don't want to lead my people into that hell.<eos> No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters.<eos> And that is precisely what we are doing.<eos> Let us drink to Tommen, the First of His Name,<eos> King of the Andals and the First Men,<eos> Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.<eos> King Tommen insists on his sister's return to the capital?<eos> I'm afraid he does.<eos> I cannot disobey my king's command.<eos> She will return with you to King's Landing.
Slut.<eos> Prince Doran,<eos> Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.<eos> I didn't realize there were knights of the Blackwater.<eos> Only the one.<eos> I believe you've already met Prince Trystane.<eos> Prince.<eos> Sorry about the other day.<eos> Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy.<eos> He's agreed to grant you your freedom.
Oysters, clams, and cockles.<eos> Oysters, clams, and cockles.<eos> Oysters, clams, and cockles.<eos> Oysters, clams, and cock...<eos> How much for your little clam?<eos> Oysters, clams, and cockles.<eos> Oysters, clams, and cockles.<eos> Come on.<eos> Some oysters, girl!<eos> I'm talking to you.
Is, uh...<eos> - Girl!<eos> - Tie her up!<eos> Are you deaf?<eos> Girl!<eos> Girl!<eos> My lord.<eos> My lord.<eos> Lord Tyrell.<eos> On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the Free City of Braavos.
Nothing better for your cockstand than fresh oysters.<eos> - Here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I'll have one.<eos> Any vinegar?<eos> Who let this girl in?<eos> Shoo!<eos> Shoo!<eos> Good.<eos> I'll tell you when we're done.
Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from?<eos> They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from.<eos> Here no one blinked an eye.<eos> 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you'd been named Targaryen.<eos> It's always changing, who we're supposed to love and who we're not.<eos> The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want.<eos> I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I love.<eos> Perhaps even you are innocent of that.<eos> Father.<eos> Aren't you cold?
It's all the choosing sides that made everything so horrible.<eos> Sometimes a person has to choose.<eos> Sometimes the world forces his hand.<eos> If a man knows what he is... and remains true to himself... the choice is no choice at all.<eos> He must fulfill his destiny... and become who he is meant to be.<eos> However much he may hate it.<eos> It's all right, Father.<eos> You don't even know what I'm talking about.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I want to help you.
- No. - Please!<eos> Let go!<eos> No! - It's a good thing.<eos> - A great thing.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Stop!<eos> - Please!<eos> - Hear us now, my Lord.<eos> - You can't do this!<eos> - For you, we offer up this girl
You don't approve?<eos> There's always been more than enough death in the world for my taste.<eos> I can do without it in my leisure time.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Yet it's an unpleasant question, but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?<eos> It's easy to confuse what is with what ought to be, especially when what is has worked out in your favor.<eos> I'm not talking about myself.<eos> I'm talking about the necessary conditions for greatness.<eos> That is greatness?<eos> That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen, which existed long before you or I and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
I know that.<eos> - I know you do, my sweet boy.<eos> I said, "Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"<eos> And he said, "Well, what is the record?<eos> I'm sure we can break it."<eos> Mother.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Well don't you look lovely.<eos> Marriage agrees with you.<eos> Can we bring you anything to eat or drink?
We will never forget that.<eos> But it's a question of survival.<eos> Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely.<eos> Mm, winter is coming.<eos> I know it.<eos> We march on Winterfell within a fortnight.<eos> Before the snows trap us here.<eos> And the wildlings?<eos> They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it.<eos> I leave their fate to you.
Most of the brothers, yes.<eos> There's little love for the free folk here.<eos> You're the Lord Commander.<eos> Your decision.<eos> You have many enemies in Castle Black.<eos> Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere?<eos> Give him command of Eastwach-by-the-Sea.<eos> I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.<eos> Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.<eos> He sees something in you.
Who are you?<eos> What?<eos> You, who walk in here with a coin you never earned, whose value you do not respect.<eos> Who are you?<eos> No one.<eos> Ow!<eos> Cunt!<eos> A lie, a sad little lie.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I told you, I'm no...
Arya Stark's stolen silver.<eos> A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Stark's things?<eos> What do we do with them after we wash them?<eos> Open gates!<eos> Hold up!<eos> Lady Sansa, welcome.<eos> Lord Bolton.<eos> May I introduce my son, Ramsay Bolton?<eos> It's an honor to meet you, my lady.<eos> I'll bring you a bowl of hot water.
As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit.<eos> First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task.<eos> Brian.<eos> It seems like a good job for a ginger.<eos> Ser Alliser.<eos> You have more experience than any other ranger at Castle Black.<eos> You proved your valour many times over by defending the Wall from the wildling attack.<eos> I name you First Ranger.<eos> Lord Janos.<eos> I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
First Builder Yarwyck can spare...<eos> I was charged with the defense of King's Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes.<eos> Keep your ruin.<eos> Alright, alright.<eos> Enough of that.<eos> You mistake me, my Lord.<eos> That was a command, not an offer.<eos> Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard.<eos> I will not go meekly off to freeze and die.<eos> Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you.
You're scum!<eos> All of you!<eos> If the boy thinks he can frighten me, he's mistaken, yes, very mistaken.<eos> A disgrace!<eos> I have friends, important friends in the capital!<eos> You'll see!<eos> If you have any last words, my Lord... now is the time.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> You're the Lord Commander!<eos> We all serve you. I'm sorry.
I heard this assault began in Littlefinger's brothel.<eos> High Septon, this is a rather shocking thing to hear.<eos> I tend to both the highest born and the lowliest amongst us.<eos> Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother.<eos> So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes?<eos> A man's private affairs ought to stay private.<eos> What do you want from us, High Septon?<eos> Justice!<eos> I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells.<eos> I ask that you execute their leader, this so-called High Sparrow.
Easy, friend.<eos> Come on, children.<eos> She really is lovely.<eos> I hope I can make her happy.<eos> I hope so, too.<eos> I've become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together.<eos> She's suffered enough.<eos> I'll never hurt her.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I've heard very little about you.

I haven't been a lord very long.<eos> - I was a bastard.<eos> - And you're not anymore.<eos> Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish.<eos> Yes, father.<eos> And thank you, Lord Baelish.<eos> I'm forever in your debt.<eos> He seems pleased.<eos> Shouldn't he be?<eos> I assure you she's still a virgin.
And yet she still has friends.<eos> men in important places, whom she can ask for favours.<eos> A message for you, from Cersei Lannister.<eos> A rider arrived from Eyrie, shortly before dawn.<eos> Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale.<eos> A message for me, you say.<eos> Strange that the seal is broken.<eos> I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish.<eos> If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance.<eos> The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros.
The king's expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage.<eos> He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.<eos> My very own Kingsguard?<eos> Please express my...<eos> Safe travels, Lord Tyrell.<eos> Of course. Of course.<eos> I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos.<eos> The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.<eos> Not small enough.<eos> May I offer you some wine?
How may I serve?<eos> All over Westeros we hear of septs being burned, Silent Sisters raped, the bodies of holy men piled in the streets.<eos> Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the gods.<eos> Perhaps the gods need a sword of their own.<eos> In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven.<eos> Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago.<eos> If I explain their holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy.<eos> An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people?<eos> An army in service to the gods themselves.<eos> And to you, of course, as the chosen representative of the Seven.
Get off me!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Move!<eos> This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.<eos> Cocksuckers.<eos> Boy fucker.<eos> You buggering filth!<eos> There's a special place in the seventh hell for your kind. Please.<eos> Please, I'll pay.<eos> I'll pay all of you.
I have to send word to Grandmother.<eos> Will you come back later?<eos> I need to be with my family, Your Grace.<eos> Of course.<eos> You think highly of this boy?<eos> Good.<eos> Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.<eos> And a bastard by some tavern slut.<eos> Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.<eos> I should have given you a son.
Of course.<eos> You think highly of this boy?<eos> Good.<eos> Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.<eos> And a bastard by some tavern slut.<eos> Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way.<eos> I should have given you a son.<eos> Not your fault.<eos> Whose, then?<eos> I gave you nothing but weakness
- Not him.<eos> - I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But we need men and supplies, and Roose Bolton's the Warden of the North.<eos> He murdered my brother.<eos> We swore to be the watchers on the Wall. We can't watch the Wall with 50 men.<eos> And we can't get more men without help from the Warden of the North.<eos> Apologies, my lady.<eos> Lord Commander.<eos> How can I help you?
Come with us when we ride south.<eos> None of us know the castle as well as you do.<eos> Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people.<eos> Winterfell was your home once.<eos> Don't you want to chase the rats out of it?<eos> Castle Black is my home now.<eos> The Night's Watch take no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.<eos> There's only one war.<eos> Life against death.<eos> Come, let me show you what you're fighting for.
The Night's Watch take no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.<eos> There's only one war.<eos> Life against death.<eos> Come, let me show you what you're fighting for.<eos> You're gonna show me some vision in the fire?<eos> Forgive me. I don't trust in visions.<eos> No visions. No magic.<eos> Just life.<eos> Do you feel my heart beating?<eos> There's power in you.
Grateful for your late father's courageous support of his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North.<eos> But I...<eos> I wouldn't...<eos> Wardeness of the North?<eos> You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.<eos> And what if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell? Or he does, and the Boltons defeat him?<eos> Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> He's already fallen for you.
Breakfast.<eos> That would have been a shit way to die.<eos> As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die.<eos> Aye, but your lot have to give the singers a good ending.<eos> I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.<eos> No?<eos> Two knights off to rescue a princess.<eos> Sounds like a good song to me.<eos> Sounds like all the rest.<eos> What about you?
I had never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father.<eos> My mother wept, said I was too young and a girl.<eos> Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said,<eos> "Girl or boy, we fight our battles,<eos> "but the gods let us choose our weapons."<eos> My father pointed to the spear, and then to my mother's tears.<eos> I made my choice long ago.<eos> Will you untie me?<eos> Will you please untie me?<eos> Will you please?
Your captor.<eos> Do you have wine?<eos> No.<eos> Can't sleep without wine.<eos> Then stay awake.<eos> You're going the wrong way.<eos> My sister is in Westeros.<eos> Westeros is west.<eos> We're heading east.<eos> I'm not taking you to your sister.
My sister is in Westeros.<eos> Westeros is west.<eos> We're heading east.<eos> I'm not taking you to your sister.<eos> You said you were taking me to the queen.<eos> I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen.<eos> She's the queen I serve.<eos> What a waste of a good kidnapping.<eos> It so happens I was heading there myself.<eos> What business would you have with the queen?
Another step.<eos> They will eat you if I tell them to.<eos> They may eat you even if I don't.<eos> Children.<eos> Some say I should give up on them.<eos> But a good mother never gives up on her children.<eos> She disciplines them if she must.<eos> But she does not give up on them.<eos> Who is innocent?<eos> Maybe all of you are, maybe none of you are.
We don't have much time, and they have less.<eos> The Walkers are coming, and they'll hit your people first.<eos> I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin.<eos> Make peace to save your people.<eos> Most of them are at Hardhome.<eos> You know where that is?<eos> Up on Storrold's Point.<eos> I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.<eos> We'll need ships.<eos> I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
A dozen abandoned villages.<eos> And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages?<eos> Because the wildlings raided them for years.<eos> Cut them down just like they did this boy's people.<eos> Aye!<eos> We've been fighting them for thousands of years.<eos> They've slaughtered villages.<eos> They've slaughtered our brothers.<eos> And we've slaughtered theirs.<eos> I will follow you anywhere, you know that.
Who made it for you?<eos> Uh, I made it myself.<eos> Really?<eos> Who...<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter.<eos> May I?<eos> Oh, wonderful.<eos> The stitching.<eos> - Who taught you?
Who are you?<eos> I'm Myranda, the kennel master's daughter.<eos> May I?<eos> Oh, wonderful.<eos> The stitching.<eos> - Who taught you?<eos> - My mother.<eos> I'm sorry for what happened to her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's good that she taught you.
The North remembers.<eos> I punished him for it.<eos> He's not ironborn anymore.<eos> Not Theon Greyjoy anymore.<eos> He's a new man.<eos> A new person, anyway.<eos> Aren't you, Reek? Yes, master.<eos> That's his new name, Reek.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Because Reek has something to say to you.
Look at her, Reek.<eos> An apology doesn't mean anything if you're not looking the person in the eye.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Sorry about what?<eos> For killing your brothers.<eos> There, over and done with.<eos> Doesn't everyone feel better?<eos> That was getting very tense.<eos> You know what, my lady?<eos> What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone, Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left.
Now you have given the Masters what they deserve.<eos> If I give everyone what they deserve, I'll have no one left to rule.<eos> Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city, right up to the morning he died.<eos> Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters, and let the rest of the city fend for itself.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Your Grace, I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters.<eos> You are as fit as anyone I know.<eos> You know why I'm here, and who will suffer the most if this all falls apart.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> I can only tell you what I have seen, Your Grace.
Get behind!<eos> Mormont, cut me free!<eos> Mormont!<eos> Mormont!<eos> Mormont!<eos> Tyrion.<eos> Tyrion.<eos> Tyrion.<eos> Tyrion.<eos> You're all right.
Mormont!<eos> Mormont!<eos> Tyrion.<eos> Tyrion.<eos> Tyrion.<eos> Tyrion.<eos> You're all right.<eos> You're heavier than you look.<eos> Did any of them touch you?<eos> You?
My son, Jorah, fled Westeros.<eos> He brought dishonor to our house.<eos> I need to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.<eos> And how's this going, Commander Mormont?<eos> I shall have your head!<eos> You're taking us through Valyria.<eos> The Doom still rules Valyria.<eos> Stone Men!<eos> Had any touch you?<eos> You?
You're not hungry?<eos> Of course I'm hungry.<eos> You're an awful travelling companion, do you know that?<eos> Possibly the least charming man I've ever met.<eos> I'm not your travelling companion.<eos> We are travelling together in each other's company, therefore--<eos> Do you ever shut up?<eos> I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos in a crate without ever saying a word.<eos> Why?<eos> It never occurred to you to ask why until now?
Myrcella.<eos> Uncle Jaime?<eos> I--<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Let's speak in private.<eos> - I am Trystane Martell.<eos> - Trystane is my intended.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Good to meet you.
The famously tart-tongued Queen of Thorns.<eos> And the famous tart Queen Cersei.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> I know you're behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.<eos> If you apologize for that comment, perhaps I'll--<eos> You'll get your apology when I get Loras.<eos> I was as shocked as anyone when the Faith arrested Ser Loras.<eos> I have no love for these fanatics, but what can a Queen Mother do?<eos> Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?<eos> I can assure you, our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
He was my friend.<eos> He was my king.<eos> Wasn't Joffrey your king?<eos> He was anointed by the Seven, not Renly.<eos> I was wrong to support Renly's claim, I know that.<eos> But I was forgiven by Joffrey.<eos> I fought for him at the Battle of Blackwater.<eos> Yes, wearing Renly's armor.<eos> Why does it matter what I wore?<eos> Do you deny all the charges against you?
Of course I deny them.<eos> You never lay with Renly Baratheon?<eos> Never.<eos> Nor any other man?<eos> Never.<eos> That will be all, Ser Loras.<eos> Well, I think that's quite enough of that.<eos> The Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.<eos> You call me forward?<eos> Yes, we have some questions for you.
You can't do this.<eos> I am the queen.<eos> Tommen!<eos> Tommen!<eos> I am your queen.<eos> How dare you?<eos> Take your hands off me!<eos> Tommen!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Lord Ramsay sent me to draw you a bath, my lady.
Hunt?<eos> Mmm.<eos> Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it?<eos> Not so pretty.<eos> But, well, it's your wedding day.<eos> Why am I talking about such things?<eos> What was your name again?<eos> Myranda.<eos> And how long have yo loved him, Myranda?<eos> Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it?
First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black.<eos> Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all the brothers who have died fighting the wildlings.
- You do know.<eos> Trust yourself.<eos> And you?<eos> Do you trust yourself?<eos> I trust in the Lord.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Winterfell.<eos> I have seen the flayed man banners lowered to the ground.<eos> But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory.<eos> I have shown you the power of king's blood.
If you break his laws, you will be punished.<eos> Don't you walk away from me.<eos> You don't give commands here, Lady Olenna.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> Gold?<eos> I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.<eos> What, then?<eos> I imagine this is strange for you.<eos> Everyone you meet has a hidden motive and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.<eos> But I'm telling you a simple truth.
What, then?<eos> I imagine this is strange for you.<eos> Everyone you meet has a hidden motive and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.<eos> But I'm telling you a simple truth.<eos> I serve the gods.<eos> The gods demand justice.<eos> How do they communicate their demands?<eos> By raven or horse?<eos> By the holy text, "The Seven-Pointed Star."<eos> If you don't have one in your library, I'll give you my own.
Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princess's well-being.<eos> You looked different when I left.<eos> You had more hair.<eos> And more hands.<eos> - How's Trystane?<eos> - He'll be all right.<eos> I'm sorry for that.<eos> It wasn't supposed to happen that way.<eos> Why is it happening at all?<eos> Your mother's worried about you.

It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death.<eos> The only antidote.<eos> Who's the most beautiful woman in the world?<eos> You.<eos> Sorry? Who?<eos> You.<eos> Don't drop it.<eos> I think you're very handsome as well.<eos> - I'm sorry about the locale.<eos> - No, you're not.
Don't drop it.<eos> I think you're very handsome as well.<eos> - I'm sorry about the locale.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> It felt like the safest place.<eos> Not for your clientele, clearly.<eos> It was an establishment like no other.<eos> The sheer range of appetites catered to.<eos> Desires that didn't even exist until we invented them.<eos> You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?
It was an establishment like no other.<eos> The sheer range of appetites catered to.<eos> Desires that didn't even exist until we invented them.<eos> You've always been rather impressed with yourself, haven't you?<eos> The past is the past.<eos> The future is all that's worth discussing.<eos> The future of House Tyrell.<eos> Don't pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren or me.<eos> I should have known you'd return to the capital as soon as things started to go wrong.<eos> - I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined.
A piece of information she knew that I had.<eos> Neither silence nor lies were an option.<eos> But I have other information of which she is unaware.<eos> And as you say, our interests are aligned.<eos> I have a gift for you.<eos> What kind of gift?<eos> The same kind I gave Cersei.<eos> A handsome young man.<eos> Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the great games.<eos> When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon, it will represent a significant rise in your station.

Fight!<eos> I think I've seen enough.<eos> Your Grace, it is a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged.<eos> I've sacrificed more than enough for your traditions.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Wait your turn, you piece of fucking filth.<eos> Get him out of my sight.<eos> Khaleesi, please.<eos> I just need a moment of your time.<eos> I brought you a gift.

I brought you a gift.<eos> It's true.<eos> He has.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I am the gift.<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace.<eos> My name is Tyrion Lannister.<eos> This is horrible.<eos> Unacceptable.<eos> Are they feeding you enough at least?

Your Grace, I want to say--<eos> You will not speak.<eos> How do I know you are who you say you are?<eos> If only I were otherwise.<eos> If you are Tyrion Lannister, why shouldn't I kill you to pay your family back for what it did to mine?<eos> You want revenge against the Lannisters?<eos> I killed my mother Joanna Lannister on the day I was born.<eos> I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bolt to the heart.<eos> I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.<eos> So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
If you'd rather return to the fighting pits, just say the word.<eos> When I was a young man, I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory.<eos> She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves.<eos> They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who'd been sent to kill her.<eos> She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that.<eos> And then a few years later, the most well-informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all three in a very short span of time, along with three dragons.<eos> He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world.<eos> I thought you were worth meeting at the very least.<eos> And why are you worth meeting?<eos> Why should I spend my time listening to you?
I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.<eos> If that is indeed what you are.<eos> So you want to advise me?<eos> Very well.<eos> What would you have me do with him?<eos> I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.<eos> I know.<eos> Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?<eos> Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man.<eos> I can't remember ever seeing a sane man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you.
He claims he would kill for you and die for you and nothing I ever witnessed gives me reason to doubt him.<eos> And yet he did betray you.<eos> Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayal?<eos> Yes.<eos> Many opportunities.<eos> And did he?<eos> No, not until forced to do so.<eos> He worships you.<eos> He is in love with you, I think.<eos> But he did not trust you with the truth.

The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.<eos> Well, I did reopen the fighting pits.<eos> Under my rule, murder will once again become entertainment.<eos> Yes, that was wise.<eos> And you agreed to marry someone you loathe for the greater good.<eos> Very impressive.<eos> My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, gods forbid.<eos> She ended up having him killed.<eos> Perhaps it won't come to that.<eos> It's not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for.<eos> If you chop off my head, well, my final days were interesting.<eos> I'm not going to kill you.<eos> No?<eos> Banish me?<eos> No.<eos> So if I'm not going to be murdered and I'm not going to be banished--<eos> You're going to advise me.<eos> While you can still speak in complete sentences.<eos> Advise you on what?
Perhaps you should try wanting something else.<eos> If I want jokes, I'll get myself a proper fool.<eos> I'm not entirely joking.<eos> There's more to the world than Westeros after all.<eos> How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here?<eos> Perhaps this is where you belong, where you can do the most good.<eos> I fought so that no child born into Slaver's Bay would ever know what it meant to be bought or sold.<eos> I will continue that fight here and beyond.<eos> But this is not my home.<eos> When you get back to your home, who supports you?
I'm going to break the wheel.<eos> You said whoever wins will fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen.<eos> I won.<eos> - You struck me. - Have me flogged if it makes you happy.<eos> But I'm the best you've got.<eos> If I win at the Great Pit, how much can you sell me for?<eos> You're a free man.<eos> You could have gone anywhere.<eos> Why did you come back?<eos> Let me fight for her and I belong to you.
Let me fight for her and I belong to you.<eos> Thirsty?<eos> Confess.<eos> I'll get out of here, you realize, before long.<eos> Confess.<eos> I can make you a wealthy woman.<eos> A lady of the court.<eos> Confess.<eos> Or I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable.<eos> And all I do is sit here imagining hideous ways for you to die.
Try not to worry, Olly.<eos> I've been worrying about Jon for years.<eos> He always comes back.<eos> Turn us about!<eos> You trust me, Jon Snow?<eos> Does that make me a fool?<eos> We're fools together now.<eos> Lord of Bones.<eos> Been a long time.<eos> Last time I saw you, the little crow was your prisoner.
And when you're done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock?<eos> Gather the elders and let's talk.<eos> My name's Jon Snow.<eos> I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.<eos> We're not friends.<eos> We've never been friends.<eos> We won't become friends today.<eos> This isn't about friendship.<eos> This is about survival.<eos> This is about putting a 700-foot wall between you and what's out there.
Dragonglass.<eos> A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.<eos> - You saw this?<eos> - No.<eos> But I trust the man.<eos> There are old stories about dragonglass.<eos> There are old stories about ice spiders as big as hounds.<eos> And with the things we've seen, you don't believe them?<eos> Come with me and I'll share these weapons.<eos> Come with you where?
There are old stories about ice spiders as big as hounds.<eos> And with the things we've seen, you don't believe them?<eos> Come with me and I'll share these weapons.<eos> Come with you where?<eos> There are good lands south of the Wall.<eos> The Night's Watch will let you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.<eos> I knew Mance Rayder.<eos> He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch.<eos> He wanted a new life for his people, for you.<eos> We're prepared to give you that new life.
If you swear you'll join us when the real war begins.<eos> Where is Mance?<eos> - He died.<eos> - How?<eos> I put an arrow through his heart.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.<eos> Hey, none of you saw Mance die.
I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.<eos> Hey, none of you saw Mance die.<eos> I did.<eos> The southern king who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send us a message.<eos> Jon Snow defied that cunt's orders.<eos> His arrow was mercy.<eos> What he did took courage.<eos> And that's what we need today, the courage to make peace with men we've been killing for generations.<eos> I lost my father, my uncle, and two brothers fighting the damn crows.<eos> I'm not asking you to forget your dead.

- Get yourselves ready.<eos> - Aye!<eos> Johnna is gonna look after you.<eos> She's in charge.<eos> You listen to her.<eos> Take her.<eos> There you are.<eos> I want to go with you.<eos> I need to get the old folks on the boats.<eos> I'm right behind you.
No, please, please.<eos> Bolton has women fighting for him?<eos> I don't fight for the Boltons.<eos> I'm Brienne of Tarth.<eos> I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.<eos> I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face.<eos> You murdered him with blood magic?<eos> I did.<eos> In the name of Renly of House Baratheon, First of His Name, rightful King of the Andals and the First Men,<eos> Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die.
My lady. I've come to escort you back to your chamber.<eos> Go with her, please.<eos> I know what Ramsay is.<eos> I know what he'll do to me.<eos> If I'm going to die, let it happen while there's still some of me left.<eos> Die?<eos> Who said anything about dying?<eos> You can't die.<eos> Your father was Warden of the North. Ramsay needs you.<eos> Though I suppose he doesn't need all of you.
Who's this?<eos> No one at all.<eos> Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall.<eos> The faces are for no one.<eos> You are still someone.<eos> And to someone, the faces are as good as poison.<eos> I can't see.<eos> What's happening?<eos> What's happening?<eos> - I wish you a safe journey home.
I've survived so far.<eos> Which I respect, but you would not help us on this expedition.<eos> You would help us here in Meereen, though.<eos> None of us have experience governing a city except for him.<eos> You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen.<eos> He's a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language.<eos> Why would the Meereenese listen to him?<eos> They wouldn't.<eos> They will listen to Grey Worm.<eos> I'll come with you.
- You had a husband.<eos> A husband off whoring every chance he...<eos> His sins do not pardon your own.<eos> May the gods forgive me.<eos> Other men?<eos> No.<eos> No others?<eos> No.<eos> Speaking falsehoods before the gods is a great crime.<eos> You understand this?
To a single sin.<eos> Others you have denied.<eos> Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.<eos> I bow to the wisdom of Your High Holiness.<eos> But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother's mercy.<eos> I haven't seen my son...<eos> I don't know how long it's been.<eos> I need to see him, please.<eos> You have taken the first step on the path back to righteousness.<eos> In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep.
Thank you.<eos> The Mother is merciful.<eos> It is her you should thank. I will.<eos> I will.<eos> I swear it, day and night.<eos> Good.<eos> Am I free to go?<eos> After your atonement.<eos> My atonement?<eos> A sinner comes before you.
Am I free to go?<eos> After your atonement.<eos> My atonement?<eos> A sinner comes before you.<eos> Cersei of House Lannister.<eos> Mother to His Grace King Tommen.<eos> Widow of His Grace King Robert.<eos> She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication.<eos> She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness.<eos> To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her to you, the good people of the city.

Shame.<eos> Shame.<eos> Shame.<eos> Shame.<eos> Shame.<eos> Shame.<eos> Shame.<eos> Shame.<eos> Your Grace.<eos> It's good to have you back.
Shame.<eos> Shame.<eos> Shame.<eos> Shame.<eos> Shame.<eos> Shame.<eos> Your Grace.<eos> It's good to have you back.<eos> Come.<eos> We'll take you inside. I need to have a look at those feet.
Don't touch me unless you love me, all right?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, Lieu, can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> That Shafe kid... You volunteering to give him the buzz cut?<eos> No. So wait. I report to you?<eos> Yep.<eos> - Lieutenant says. Because...<eos> Missing girl's from a family with juice, Lieutenant thinks it's not a bad idea to be nice to a dad who's friends with the mayor, the governor, maybe even the next president.<eos> Look, I didn't crack some secret hippie code to tell you what they're really saying, and I don't want to be the bait to get you in the room just so you can start bashing skulls.
Borrow your pen, my man?<eos> I need 2 grand.<eos> What?<eos> For my demo. Matty Gladberg said a good one's, like, a grand, but we want mine to be great.<eos> So...<eos> Bring it here.<eos> Where did you find this stuff? It was all going to waste.<eos> Any grocery store, out back, if it's a day past the date, they throw away enough to feed the entire world a hundred times over.<eos> Look at all this stuff.<eos> Do you like cherries?
Like felt tip?<eos> Does it glow in the dark, like those things they wave at concerts?<eos> Is that what they wave at concerts? !<eos> It's more like a nicotine colour.<eos> Oh, my God, is it just me? !<eos> Yes, it's just you.<eos> - Oh, my God! Have I curdled? !<eos> - You mean, it's really yellow?<eos> Your spunk is yellow?<eos> How are things with you two?
It's like that with all of them. They develop secret crushes on me.<eos> And then, when you tell them you can't have kids, well... They can tell that I can.<eos> - But now we'll see more of each other.<eos> - It's starting.<eos> No, thanks. There.<eos> It's rolling now.<eos> Gabriel and Elias, when you see this, I'll have gone home to God.<eos> The past should be a cornerstone of every person's life.<eos> And in your case, especially, seeing as none of you have great prospects of raising a family.<eos> But the fact is... I never told you the truth about your past and parentage.
He's a bad mayor. That is really poor leadership.<eos> Elias, I really think you should try and talk to our brothers.<eos> You want to go back? To those brothers?<eos> It makes no sense.<eos> Surely our mothers didn't all die in childbirth.<eos> It's plain suicide.<eos> Elias is great at handling conflict.<eos> He speaks their language.<eos> I know you're in there, and I'm pretty damn sure you can hear me.<eos> We mean you no harm, and I'm not from the hospital.
Elias is great at handling conflict.<eos> He speaks their language.<eos> I know you're in there, and I'm pretty damn sure you can hear me.<eos> We mean you no harm, and I'm not from the hospital.<eos> I'm not mad at you for beating Gabriel with the mute swan.<eos> It happens to the best of us, but we're your flesh and blood, your brothers.<eos> We have just as much right to see our biological parents as you do.<eos> Gabriel is right here, and he has several questions about our mothers that he demands Evelio answers now.<eos> Let's all act like adults here, and let reason prevail this night.<eos> I'll give you 20 seconds, starting now, to open that door or the house will be surrounded, and then it's out of my hands.
Families should stick together.<eos> And if you end up staying, just make sure to inform the national register.<eos> - Go home now, Flemming. - Sure.<eos> But don't forget to register.<eos> - Give my best to Evelio.<eos> - He's desperate for more inhabitants.<eos> The Geodetic Institute strikes towns with less than 40 off the map.<eos> - When does Dad usually wake up?<eos> - Oh, he can sleep all day.<eos> - Don't you have jobs to attend? - No.
- Shuttlecocks do that. Keep up!<eos> - It was nowhere near out.<eos> - I'm serving, please.<eos> - Josef, butt out!<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'll be damned. You interrupted me.<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> - Yes, don't interr...<eos> Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?
That's the bad news.<eos> The good news... they succeeded in their mission.<eos> They succeeded.<eos> The Espheni power core is down.<eos> And in the days leading up to our victory, we witnessed a mass exodus of their ships leaving our planet.<eos> We don't know why, but we know they have their work cut out for them now dealing with the mess we just made for them, and that means one thing...<eos> For once, we have the upper hand.<eos> So, let's do this!<eos> My husband and my daughter gave their lives so that we could finish this, and that's what we're gonna do... Finish it.<eos> I know that some of you can never forgive Lexi.
I don't know.<eos> Maybe when you were incapacitated, there was some autopilot function that landed the beamer in the water or ejected you.<eos> That's as good of an explanation as I've heard so far.<eos> Or maybe the beamer sank.<eos> Maybe... maybe none of that matters.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You're right.<eos> All that matters is that you're back.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I wish I had a better story to tell you.
Exactly.<eos> I wish I had a better story to tell you.<eos> I really do, because, let's face it, my sudden return here is...<eos> a little freaky.<eos> No.<eos> I got a clean bill of health.<eos> So, as I know more, you'll know more.<eos> And in the meantime, uh... as you've heard...<eos> Anne and I lost our daughter on this mission.<eos> And what I'm about to say may strike some of you as a little unusual coming from me.
We're not gonna do that.<eos> This is the time for overkill, to fire both barrels, to use everything we've got!<eos> Our enemy is still out there, but they're unprotected and they're vulnerable and they are just waiting for us to take them out, if we've got the will to do it!<eos> Hell, yeah!<eos> Because when the last bullet goes into the last Skitter, This war's over!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Soon the time will come for us to go back to being doctors and bricklayers, schoolteachers, mothers and fathers,<eos> That is not who we are.<eos> Right now, we are warriors.<eos> And so I'm putting a challenge to each and every one of you... To find your warrior.
Sorry about the kid.<eos> He's young, looking to make his mark.<eos> I like him.<eos> Your daughter-in-law, what...?<eos> What's she gonna tell us?<eos> I don't honestly know.<eos> Well, Mike, if she's got nothing to say, this pretty well ends it here.<eos> So maybe you should talk to her before we do.<eos> I talked.<eos> If I were to guess, I'd say she wouldn't tell you much.
Bug!<eos> Hello, Angels.<eos> Bug, what are you doing here?<eos> Feds are funny, you know.<eos> They spend all that money protecting things that nobody cares about.<eos> Then they leave the real information lying around like a Post-it note on a refrigerator.<eos> For instance, when they confiscate illegal electronic equipment, it's inventoried to a site... that's like a shopping list to a guy like me.<eos> So...<eos> Thank you, baby.<eos> So when I saw exactly the things that I had just sold you posted, well... the Bug suspected foul play.
But he knows... sometimes it is necessary...<eos> No, don't touch me.<eos> You have nothing to be afraid of.<eos> - You are one of us.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No!<eos> You're one of us!<eos> Don't touch her!<eos> If I see you... any of you, here again, I will show you what violence looks like.
Looks totally real, doesn't it?<eos> I figured it would buy us a little more time.<eos> That's the question.<eos> How much time do we have, how much time does she have?<eos> None.<eos> You're out of time.<eos> Jonas.<eos> I told you I made a mistake.<eos> I wish there was some way to fix it, but there's not.<eos> I was just afraid if I didn't help you, you wouldn't be alive right now.
Yes.<eos> Even when I tell you that Whispers knows about Riley?<eos> How?<eos> I have all the information locked down.<eos> You know about her and Will knows about her... and I know you.<eos> And Whispers... knows me.<eos> Be careful what you tell them.<eos> Not too much, or they won't believe you.<eos> He's here with me now.<eos> He wants me to tell you that he's going to Iceland, that he's going to find Riley, and once he does, it won't be long until he finds the rest of you.
It's not something you make happen.<eos> It is something you let happen.<eos> It took me quite some time to understand the difference.<eos> I'm hoping it won't take you as long.<eos> You also have to learn the difference between "visiting" and "sharing."<eos> Visiting is what we're doing now.<eos> Sharing is something you can only do inside your cluster, accessing each other's knowledge, language, skill...<eos> - What's a cluster?<eos> - You have seven other selves now, but unless you hurry, there's only going to be six.<eos> One of you is about to be destroyed.
London.<eos> Ah... Harry Potter.<eos> The Queen. Eh?<eos> English tea.<eos> Can I?<eos> I like it.<eos> Hey, Van Damme, give me the fucking bag.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Give it to me or we beat the fuck out of you.<eos> I don't want to hurt you.
We're raiding the chisholms today, and now I'm a man short.<eos> And I could do with a tall, strong scotsman Who's swift with a sword.<eos> So unless you're prepared to dig seven graves, including your own...<eos> I'll ride with you.<eos> This once.<eos> I'm coming, too. No, you're not.<eos> If he wants to come, let him come.<eos> He's got two hands.<eos> He can hold a gun.<eos> I'll have you both.
Fine, I'll keep my mouth shut.<eos> Aye...<eos> Till we reach the horses I expect.<eos> For the show, any alms.<eos> Alms, alms, alms for the show.<eos> That flat-footed lummock has no feeling for the tune.<eos> None.<eos> I'll see about securing a spot for you once this clodhopper is finished.<eos> Crowd seems receptive enough.<eos> And now, I give you... The sassenach!
If there's a chance that I can save him, then I have to try.<eos> But if I fail, or if he's already dead...<eos> I will marry you.<eos> I'll not force any of my men to go to their deaths.<eos> But I'll not stand in the way of any that choose to go.<eos> Look, I like the lad, but it's Wentworth.<eos> There's nae chance.<eos> Bloody cowards.<eos> I understand your hesitation.<eos> What I'm asking is daunting. But I know if the situation were reversed, Jamie would come for every single one of you.
You're not even here, are you?<eos> _ Of course you're not here.<eos> Everybody's at the high school.<eos> Kira.<eos> Get back inside the car, please.<eos> I'm not getting anything either.<eos> We haven't moved in 15 minutes.<eos> I'm gonna be late.<eos> What is this thing you're going to anyway?<eos> It's called Senior Scribe and I'm not supposed to tell you about it.
Now, coming from him that means a lot.<eos> Maybe means that things are gonna be harder for you for a while<eos> but it also means something else, doesn't it?<eos> That I'm really strong?<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> Still can't reach Kira.<eos> Okay, you reminded her about tonight though, right?<eos> I think so.<eos> She only texted me once this week.<eos> Once? How'd you guys leave things when she left for New York?
Wait, wait, wait!<eos> Your condition worsens.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'm okay, just...<eos> Just give me another chance.<eos> You were supposed to remove the obstacles.<eos> Our time is limited.<eos> Whatever you're here to do, I can help.<eos> - No second chances.<eos> - I can help you.
I know you'll come to see that it's for the best.<eos> I guess I'll have to get an office right next to yours.<eos> Finally out of the mailroom, huh?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hello.<eos> No. It's me.<eos> - This the place where we wait?<eos> - Think so.<eos> So.<eos> What'd our guy tell you about the job?
Really?<eos> How do you not pack a gun?<eos> Hi. Hello. My name is Price.<eos> Actually, that's not my name.<eos> But I have a nephew named Price.<eos> I've always kind of liked that name.<eos> Anyway, we're not dealing with names today.<eos> You can tell me or not tell me yours.<eos> Or a fake one is fine.<eos> If I need to talk to you, I'd prefer something other than "Hey, you."
We've got work to do.<eos> Our mission is to get this to my grandpa now.<eos> Tomorrow the old astros will show up and he's got to be there.<eos> - So why don't you call him?<eos> - He never answers the phone.<eos> - E-mail him?<eos> - He doesn't have a computer.<eos> Come on, guys!<eos> And remember, failure is not an option.<eos> Why do I always follow you guys?
Stop it, Admiral.<eos> If we don't get the flag first, we won't be able to prove he's a liar.<eos> We have to get the flag, and this grandpa and two kids are our only hope.<eos> It's incredible!<eos> Mind-blowing!<eos> Awesome!<eos> Hey!<eos> Marty, are you there?<eos> Yeah, Mission Control is here.<eos> Is Igor with you, guys?
Just do it!<eos> Hey, do you know where I can find a radio from the '60s?<eos> There's a bunch of old junk in storage in the basement.<eos> Man!<eos> We've lost contact with Earth, we can't fly this thing and that whack job kidnapped my grandpa.<eos> We are hosed!<eos> Hello, my puny preschool punk!<eos> Shut up, Bonehead!<eos> Pay attention, juvenile delinquents.<eos> I'm offering you a deal.

Told a copper I knew what she was up to and he set a trap for her.<eos> I knew the Church wouldn't look too kindly on it.<eos> And you didn't.<eos> Took away her habit, her name. Banished her.<eos> Left her with nothing and nobody except me.<eos> You manipulated a nun's excommunication?<eos> She was a fucking abortionist!<eos> I know you read about it.<eos> You gonna start defending her now, hmm?<eos> I did you all a fucking favor.
- I... It's just, I feel...<eos> It's hard.<eos> - Yes. And everybody tries to... But it doesn't work.<eos> There are no words... "Bullshit" comes to mind. But...<eos> I'm so tired. - Well, you just lean on us today.<eos> - Yes, like I leaned on you when Amanda broke up my relationship with Josh.<eos> Well, I'm pretty sure he stole the silverware out of my house.<eos> It was flatware and he did you a favor.<eos> Now, do you want to vent, you want to scrapbook, you wanna get revenge?<eos> Who told you about Sol?
- Oh, I can't, Milt.<eos> But one of these guys will help you out.<eos> It's a homicide.<eos> 30-year-old waitress was found killed in her apartment.<eos> But shouldn't that call have come to us?<eos> I mean, isn't the FBI... you... here to help us, and not the other way around?<eos> I made that very clear to Claire.<eos> Who's Claire?<eos> The 911 dispatcher.<eos> I met her at a barbecue the other day, and she keeps calling me, instead of you guys, by mistake.
And he wasn't ready to connect, but she wanted him to see you.<eos> She really had turned her life around.<eos> Donna's landlord said that she'd been saving for college.<eos> But we couldn't find any brochures or S.A.T. applications or anything like that.<eos> We don't think that she was saving for herself.<eos> We think it was for Max.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Um... thank you.<eos> - This is huge.<eos> - Actually, I don't think the $2,000 is really gonna make much of a difference to you guys.
Breathe...<eos> Breathe.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> East, so, uh, thank you for everything.<eos> You've been very kind, and brave, a real hero, but I must get back to my family...<eos> You're coming with me, to the Temple of Gaia.<eos> Uh... no, I'm... I'm not the Oracle.<eos> I just said that so you'd get me out.<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> I'm taking you all back. The priest will know the right one.
Heavenly Apollo, give the King strength and keep him safe.<eos> I've heard that my brother is much recovered.<eos> Yes, Lord Pallas, we must give thanks.<eos> Naturally. I rejoice.<eos> However, there are some in his court who feel that Athens can ill afford a leader who governs from a sickbed.<eos> Take me to them. I will correct their treachery with the sharp edge of my sword.<eos> Believe me, I'm doing my level best to identify them.<eos> In the meantime, you should take care.<eos> I should take care?<eos> I've heard that you, General Dion, as the King's closest confidant, may be a target.
You're making this very awkward, Mercenary.<eos> Goodbye, Oracle.<eos> I'm not leaving you!<eos> You won't like the forest of Troezen. No, we are not going to the forest of Troezen!<eos> His son?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> The visions were very clear.<eos> You bled him?<eos> Just to see if he was genuine.<eos> Once I'd established that, I intended to bring him to you, of course.
No!<eos> It's... beautiful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The Commander-in-Chief should carry a sword worthy of his status.<eos> And the Prince must always be ready to assume the throne.<eos> Sit.<eos> There's nobody here but us.<eos> Aren't you at least a little curious?<eos> There's nothing wrong with seeing what it feels like.<eos> Prince Lykos. The military council of Athens offer you this ritual honour.
Can I have some actual money to take to Playland?<eos> What?<eos> Of course.<eos> Go get my pocketbook.<eos> Can't you?<eos> Hey. Sorry for running past you.<eos> My mother hates that.<eos> Just really had to go.<eos> That's quite all right.<eos> Can I offer you all something to drink? - Iced tea?
Sally.<eos> - I'll wave from the bus. - Hold on a second.<eos> It's okay to be nervous about going away.<eos> You can't control yourself, can you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Sarah is 17, you know.<eos> I'm well aware of that, Sally.<eos> But it doesn't stop you.<eos> And it doesn't stop Mom.<eos> Anyone pays attention to either of you, and they always do, and you just ooze everywhere.
College.<eos> The whole subject is making my hair fall out.<eos> Seriously, it's like coming out in clumps.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Em, I've been rejected from every single college I applied to.<eos> Yesterday, Talmadge wait-listed me.<eos> Talmadge.<eos> Tell me that "A" isn't responsible for this.<eos> A wait-list doesn't mean rejection.<eos> Yeah, well, the rest of you are gonna be waltzing off to sorority rush and I'm gonna be stuck picking up trash in Rosewood.
We come bearing glad tidings.<eos> A match with Creel.<eos> Creel?<eos> How'd you pull that off?<eos> Mr. Sweeney can be quite persuasive when he puts his mind to it.<eos> It's me Irish charm.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Creel?<eos> - I owe you...<eos> I owe you guys. - Ah.
It's 3-to-1 that you go the distance.<eos> You drop in the fifth, we're clearing 70%.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Come on, Jackie!<eos> It's time to celebrate.<eos> It's the big time, Jack.<eos> Thanks for the offer.<eos> I'm gonna take a pass.<eos> Did he just say "pass"?<eos> I appreciate everything you've done for me.
Where is it?<eos> Go in through here, right above the eye.<eos> That's the supraorbital foramen.<eos> You want to go in right under there.<eos> Hold still.<eos> I might do some serious damage if you squirm.<eos> How will I know when I find it?<eos> He'll tell you.<eos> You're right... what you said before.<eos> I kill you, somebody takes your place, but they'll end up back here just like you, and sooner or later, one of you is gonna tell me what I need to know.
Iris's power is stronger than both ancients combined.<eos> And Mark's alone with her?<eos> Mark!<eos> Mark get out here.<eos> Dyson, we already looked for him.<eos> They're gone.<eos> Both of them.<eos> Oh come on.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> The most powerful of you is with the least powerful of us.
State your business!<eos> In there, you'll find your money and the dress.<eos> And a crown.<eos> - A crown...<eos> - Don't talk unless I tell you.<eos> I warn you, I am a desperate man.
Say it now.<eos> I love you, Rochefort.<eos> I have always loved you.<eos> All these years, I have ached for your return.<eos> I despise...<eos> I despise my husband, the King.<eos> You are the only man I have ever wanted.<eos> Take me. Make love to me.<eos> And I love you.<eos> Oh, God, howl love you.
What makes you so sure she's being held here?<eos> We fled Spain together.<eos> We thought we were safe in Paris.<eos> We were followed by General Baltasar and his Spanish agents.<eos> She went to the market.<eos> I haven't seen her since.<eos> - Then she might be dead by now.<eos> - No, she is the bait.<eos> It is me they want. Not her.<eos> You understand my father is going to kill you, Baltasar?
A country's most powerful weapon in war is hatred.<eos> You should learn that, Ambassador.<eos> You're late, Marguerite.<eos> You know the Queen likes her son to be ready when she wakes.<eos> The Dauphin was restless in the night.<eos> I think he might be ill.<eos> He's burning up.<eos> He needs a doctor.<eos> Spanish agents in Paris?<eos> A joke is being played on you, Sire.
I had to commit murder to obtain it.<eos> Wit as well as beauty.<eos> It looks very handsome.<eos> I was hoping Your Majesty might grant me a private audience.<eos> Alas, that is impossible at present... Madame...<eos> De Winter.<eos> Milady de Winter.<eos> How charming.<eos> Goodbye, Milady.<eos> Seeing you again was a pleasant diversion on a trying day.
How charming.<eos> Goodbye, Milady.<eos> Seeing you again was a pleasant diversion on a trying day.<eos> He's vomited up every drop so far.<eos> Are you sure there isn't another way?<eos> If there is no improvement, we will turn to leeches.<eos> Bleeding is an infallible cure for congested lungs.<eos> He is so very small.<eos> And he has so little blood to spare.<eos> I assure you, madame, I know what I'm doing.
As soon as Alaman has his daughter, we strike.<eos> Aramis' first shot will take out Baltasar.<eos> With their leader gone, his men should surrender.<eos> There. One of Baltasar's men?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> They're here somewhere.<eos> He's got the cipher.<eos> Second archway from the left.<eos> Two more by the bread.<eos> I swore I would hunt you down, Tariq.

Pray for him.<eos> You must be brave.<eos> I lack the strength.<eos> If he dies...<eos> Remember how you cried, all those years ago, when you left Spain for your marriage?<eos> I thought I would drown in tears.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> You were strong and you survived.<eos> I was at your side then, and I am here now.<eos> I will sit with you, if you wish.
Then why gamble with your daughter's life?<eos> - Because I had no choice!<eos> - More games.<eos> I had no choice because I do not have the cipher.<eos> Samara does.<eos> - Yeah. - I am sorry I lied, I put your friend in danger.<eos> I didn't do it lightly.<eos> Now, I humbly beg for your help.<eos> I don't know where they've taken Samara.<eos> Help me find her and I will give you what you want.

We do exactly what the Spanish want.<eos> We hand you over.
Not much of a nurse, are you?<eos> I'm not a nurse. I'm a poet.<eos> Fix your own leg.<eos> - Where are we?<eos> - Baltasar's safe house.<eos> Are you in pain?<eos> Yeah. A little bit.<eos> Something went wrong with the exchange.<eos> Yeah, your father lied to us and nearly got you killed.<eos> - That's what went wrong. - He trusted you French to save us and you made a mess of everything.
In their eyes, you are at best an exotic stranger, at worst a mongrel.<eos> I am a Moor.<eos> I'm going home to Morocco.<eos> - Where are you from?<eos> - France.<eos> And Africa.<eos> On my mother's side.<eos> Which part of Africa?<eos> Well, wherever it was, that is where you belong.<eos> In the end, your adopted country will betray you, as mine did me.
My ring!<eos> You kept it safe.<eos> My company does not please you.<eos> I shall withdraw.<eos> No.<eos> You are the one thing keeping me sane.<eos> It is my son.<eos> He's very ill.<eos> Perhaps dying.<eos> I knew there was a sadness in you.

She might be a madwoman, for all we know.<eos> You're as much to blame as she is.<eos> Arrest her! What?<eos> No!<eos> Please!<eos> Your Majesty!<eos> Find my child. For pity's sake, find him!<eos> Dear God.<eos> Someone must inform the King.<eos> I have never met anyone like you before, Milady.
No!<eos> Please!<eos> Your Majesty!<eos> Find my child. For pity's sake, find him!<eos> Dear God.<eos> Someone must inform the King.<eos> I have never met anyone like you before, Milady.<eos> There is no one like me, Sire.<eos> But I warn you, I am a very bad woman.<eos> My only ambition is to bewitch you.

My only ambition is to bewitch you.<eos> Then you are succeeding.<eos> Here.<eos> Take this as a token of my esteem.<eos> Get out!<eos> I came with news of your son.<eos> Not dead, surely.<eos> He has been kidnapped.<eos> The cipher!<eos> Release my daughter and I will tell you!
I warn you. If you lay hands on a Spanish citizen, there will be dangerous consequences.<eos> The French will never let you leave with that cipher.<eos> Perales will arrange something.<eos> I have never understood irrational hatred.<eos> It stifles every decent impulse, destroys common sense and reason.<eos> The moment a man says, "All Moors are this", or, "All white men are that", he has abandoned his sanity and revealed his weakness.<eos> And yet it is not me who is weak.<eos> Not I who will die on the scaffold.<eos> Come, give me the cipher.<eos> I will show you how it works.
She must be hanged.<eos> Your Majesty!<eos> Your Majesty, please!<eos> The Dauphin's lungs are clearing and his fever has broken.<eos> I believe he is recovering.<eos> Your leeches have done their work?<eos> As a man of science, I must conclude that it was the steam, and not I, that saved his life.<eos> Madame Bonacieux should receive the credit.<eos> Well, then, I suppose we had better not hang her.<eos> Perhaps you were right this time, Madame. But I assure you, leeches are generally an infallible cure.
But I'll learn.<eos> And it will be my children's home.<eos> They will belong there.<eos> You should search for your own home, too, one day.<eos> You're looking at it.<eos> These are not your people, Porthos.<eos> However hard you try, you will never truly be one of them.<eos> I'm a Musketeer.<eos> That's home enough for me, hmm?<eos> I have something for you.

I'm no longer your commanding officer.<eos> I'm just an ordinary Musketeer on work detail.<eos> Athos would not just vanish.<eos> Athos is drunk somewhere.<eos> He'll turn up when he's sober.<eos> We've checked all the usual taverns - no-one's seen him in days.<eos> Then the sooner this is done, the sooner we can look for him.<eos> Someone speak to me?<eos> If you mean to kill me, at least give me the courtesy of an explanation.<eos> MAN: We mean you no harm, my Lord.
I make it a rule never to open letters.<eos> Now, cut me loose, damn you!<eos> I could have your heads for this.<eos> At least that would be quick.<eos> Starving to death takes such a long time.<eos> Forgive her, my Lord, Jeanne speaks out of turn.<eos> He needs to know the truth.<eos> You judge us in our desperation.<eos> These are your lands, your people you have neglected.<eos> It is you that should be judged, Monsieur le Comte de la Fere.
These are your lands, your people you have neglected.<eos> It is you that should be judged, Monsieur le Comte de la Fere.<eos> Cut me loose.<eos> I will not listen to your complaints while I'm tied to a chair.<eos> Bills?<eos> A letter, from the estate of the Comte de la Fere asking Athos to return.<eos> All in the same hand.<eos> Signed by an innkeeper at Pinon.<eos> 'We are in desperate need of your protection.<eos> 'We entreat you to return to us 'and honour the responsibility of your family.'
Porthos, enough!<eos> And that's an order.<eos> I thought you weren't my Captain any more?<eos> Look, whatever you think you're entitled to, a fellow Musketeer might be in danger.<eos> This is not helping Athos.<eos> I'm going to find out. Whether you help me or not.<eos> Oh, Goddamn you.<eos> You've brought me back.<eos> I left this life... .. a long time ago.<eos> What gives you the right to bring me back?
God had no part in this.<eos> I've never heard of such a thing.<eos> What about your position?<eos> Your responsibility to the social order?<eos> This land is a sacred trust.<eos> It is your birthright! Your family name!<eos> I am not asking for your approval.<eos> I am still the legal landowner.<eos> Now, I must have your undertaking that my tenants will be left in peace.<eos> Perhaps you care more for such low people... .. now you are one of them yourself.

~ Did they hurt you? ~ No. ~ Thank God you're safe.<eos> Renard won't come in the dark, not across marshy ground. ~ But he'll come. ~ Let's get you home.<eos> It's true, I left without a word. And true, I never gave a thought to your fate.<eos> But you have made my absence a reason to surrender responsibility for your own lives.<eos> What future do we have without the protection of a lord?<eos> What choice when our lives are not our own?<eos> Then take Renard. Let him have the land and you with it.<eos> Exchange one noble name for another.<eos> Your attachment to my family is touching, ~ but it is no longer practical.<eos> ~ This land belongs to you.

~ I should see to the wounded.<eos> ~ Them! Don't fret.<eos> When this is over I'll make sure they're well looked after.<eos> They're my people now after all.<eos> I'm pleased to hear you say so.<eos> The thought of wearing this again. I cannot tell you how that makes me feel.<eos> What you've done for me, it means so much.<eos> I've done nothing for you.<eos> Catherine, what are you talking about?<eos> The others are asking for you.
To all of us!<eos> I have given the estate over to its people.<eos> So you're trespassing on our land.<eos> You mean to give the land to them?<eos> Of course.<eos> To everyone. You included.<eos> You'd hand this rabble your birthright to defy me?<eos> I have made my choice.<eos> So you have, and it is on your own head.<eos> Prepare yourselves - every last one of you is going to die in pain!
Thank you for all you've done.<eos> You did it, not us.<eos> My Lord, are you certain?<eos> I'm just a simple innkeeper.<eos> Call me "My Lord" one more time and I shall burn this letter to ashes.<eos> This gives you power to act with the authority of the Comte de la Fere.<eos> You are Mayor of Pinon now.<eos> The judiciary in Rouen will protect you should the Baron make any more trouble - they will not dismiss the seal of the Comte de la Fere.<eos> The former Comte.<eos> ~ I don't know what to say to you.

We're here on the King's business, to see Emilie of Duras.<eos> You know it is an act of treason to raise an army without the King's authority?<eos> I love the King.<eos> God has told me to seek him out so he can lead his people to victory.<eos> We'll march on Spain and trample King Philip into the dust.<eos> How are you going to do that?<eos> I don't see any cavalry.<eos> I don't see any artillery.<eos> God is worth a thousand cannons.<eos> Did God tell you to hate the Spanish?
You should be telling him to hang Emilie of Duras in the town square!<eos> Now.<eos> Fix it!<eos> Be careful, Perales.<eos> One day soon I will rule France, with Queen Anne at my side.<eos> And then a word from me and you'll find your head on the block.<eos> You?<eos> The ruler of France?<eos> You're madder than a rabid dog.<eos> Then be careful I don't bite you.
Here is something you don't see every day.<eos> How did you survive the noose, Milady?<eos> You cannot touch me while I'm under the King's protection.<eos> How long will that protection last when he finds out his new lover is a condemned criminal?<eos> Let me go, or you will regret it.<eos> This conversation is not over.<eos> Are you really a deserter, Aramis?<eos> When I heard you preach I knew this was where I belonged.<eos> As a soldier, I'm used to following orders but sometimes a man must follow his conscience instead.<eos> Even though they might hang you? Even then.

Even then.<eos> I will ask the King to pardon you.<eos> I'm expecting an audience very soon.<eos> I've dreamed it will happen.<eos> Do your dreams always come true?<eos> Always.<eos> People are calling you Joan of Arc reborn.

I'm glad that we can talk like this again.<eos> - You know, as friends.<eos> Do you hear all that?<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> I'm going to drink.<eos> And do you want to be alone?<eos> No.<eos> Wine?<eos> Yes.<eos> Emilie wants to see you.
We must obey His will.<eos> He must send for me soon.<eos> If you march on Spain, most of these people will die.<eos> Do you think God can protect them from muskets, artillery, gunpowder?<eos> I know He will.<eos> Faith is the only armour we need.<eos> Why Spain?<eos> Why not England or the Holy Roman Empire?<eos> It is not for me to say.<eos> You think God told you explicitly that King Philip was the Antichrist?
Why Spain?<eos> Why not England or the Holy Roman Empire?<eos> It is not for me to say.<eos> You think God told you explicitly that King Philip was the Antichrist?<eos> I know you don't believe in me, Aramis. But I know you for a good man.<eos> You won't betray me.<eos> Father Allard. You were privy to all the Cardinal's secrets.<eos> I want to know about Milady de Winter.<eos> You were the Cardinal's man, Rochefort.<eos> Didn't he tell you?
I ask the questions, you answer them.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I believe the lady in question is only lately arrived in Paris.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> Her name appears in the Cardinal's private accounts.<eos> So she was either his mistress or something even more valuable.<eos> Which was it?<eos> How dare you!<eos> Who are you to question me like this?<eos> Tell me the truth and you will be well rewarded.
I'm not a fool, Captain.<eos> And you're not a good liar.<eos> Leave it, Porthos.<eos> That's an order.<eos> I don't know how she wears this bloody thing.<eos> Keeps slipping-<eos> Get On with it.<eos> You never asked me my real name.<eos> Because I don't care.<eos> I'll give you a clue.
The messenger didn't say.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Who sent you this?<eos> Is there a note? No.<eos> But the message is clear enough.<eos> I will not be blackmailed.<eos> Remarkable that a street slut can bear herself with such arrogance.<eos> Did the Cardinal teach you that?<eos> The Cardinal taught me a great deal.<eos> Be careful I don't show you how much.
- We've told you... - Take her.<eos> A present for you, Emilie.<eos> The Spanish Queen herself.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> This man is a Musketeer. He deserted his regiment to join me.<eos> Do you know each other?<eos> He has been loyal in the past.<eos> I am sorry he has forgotten his duty.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I came here to talk to you, not only as your Queen but as a woman and a mother.
If you need me, I'll be close by.<eos> Aramis is right. It's good.<eos> Constance, what is it?<eos> You were crying out in your sleep.<eos> It was so real.<eos> I was there and...<eos> Shh, you were dreaming.<eos> I've never felt anything like it before.<eos> I was so scared.<eos> God granted you a prophecy.
We can't reject the truth when it is revealed.<eos> He's insisting that we move him somewhere safer.<eos> He knows where I am.<eos> Who does?<eos> What does this mean?<eos> It means my attempt to rid myself of a terrible menace has failed.<eos> But you won't tell us the exact nature of the threat?<eos> Orders from the palace.<eos> You're returning to Madrid.<eos> I am to escort you personally to the carriage the King has provided for you.

Rioting in the streets I can believe. This is too subtle.<eos> Then who did do it?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Our orders are to arrest her.<eos> They won't give her up easily.<eos> We're outnumbered 10 to one.<eos> I know her secret.<eos> And I know a way she'll come willingly.<eos> We give her what she most wants.<eos> The King has granted you an audience.
God will intervene to free me.<eos> Perhaps. But not in the way you mean.<eos> Judas!<eos> Oh, am I to be burned?<eos> Dear Lord, don't Let them send me to the fire.<eos> lam not brave enough.<eos> I never even met this man Perales.<eos> Well, how could I have murdered him?<eos> We know you didn't kill him. Then why am I here?<eos> We want to help you.
Well, how could I have murdered him?<eos> We know you didn't kill him. Then why am I here?<eos> We want to help you.<eos> Your visions are from soup, not God.<eos> We think you've been drugged. Perhaps for a long time.<eos> Your mother's been poisoning you.<eos> My mother?<eos> My mother loves me.<eos> She would never hurt me.<eos> I don't believe you!
She'll find her own way back to Him.<eos> The right way.<eos> If there is one.<eos> Emilie should have been executed, not released!<eos> It was Captain Treville's decision.<eos> I argued against it.<eos> Her army is dispersing. The crisis is over.<eos> Perhaps Treville did the right thing.<eos> Let's not forget, Perales was killed on his watch.<eos> Spain will expect you to take action, Sire.
Perhaps Treville did the right thing.<eos> Let's not forget, Perales was killed on his watch.<eos> Spain will expect you to take action, Sire.<eos> Vigorous action.<eos> What do I do?<eos> Perhaps it is time for a change.<eos> Treville has been your most loyal servant.<eos> You don't understand politics at all, my dear, hmm?<eos> Leave this sort of thing to the men.<eos> I want you all to know that no blame falls on any of you.
She wanted to dump him.<eos> The money was for the deposit on a flat and rent.<eos> What was she working on?<eos> - Nothing special.<eos> It was quiet. - So why the meeting?<eos> Routine.<eos> See if she'd heard anything.<eos> We have targets to meet, so we rely on our contacts.<eos> We'll need all your files relating to Corinne.<eos> I'll send them to you.
Coming?<eos> Of course.<eos> Thanks for what you did.<eos> I know I can be a pain.<eos> But I've grown up and learnt loads.<eos> - I can have my own flat.<eos> - No.<eos> - A scooter.<eos> - No.<eos> It's always the same with you two.
Our syphilitic sow is now three degrees above normal.<eos> We have no idea if quinine will even cure malaria in a pig.<eos> Well, in five more degrees, we'll load her up with it and find out.<eos> In the meantime, we let the fever rage.<eos> You've got a visitor.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> I need to begin a full dissection of this girl's body.<eos> And I'll return in an hour and take the pig's temperature.<eos> You know, if people actually knew what you did in here, they wouldn't trust you to give them a fucking aspirin.
Beautiful night.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Are you warm enough, my dear?<eos> Oh, I believe that last sherry is keeping me quite toasty.<eos> Algie.<eos> What an evening indeed.<eos> It was spectacular.<eos> I am so glad to have you here with us sharing the Knick and these times together.<eos> You know you've always been family to me, Captain.<eos> And I am expecting some little ones from you two very soon.
- She have anyplace?<eos> - No.<eos> And the father?<eos> Whaler she met at a saloon.<eos> He's somewhere in the Atlantic for all she knows.<eos> They can't just throw her in the street.<eos> I should try and get her in on the ward at the Knick.<eos> They'll certainly be eager to hear from you.<eos> I thought I had baby troubles just last month.<eos> I told you girls don't let the fella finish inside you.
All right.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> So tomorrow I'll be by to talk to you about some things. Medical things.<eos> But for now, I want you to rest up.<eos> You're safe here.<eos> Mr. Cleary will be with you as long as you want.<eos> And he'll be just outside the door while you sleep.<eos> I'll see you in the morning.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I ain't gonna let nothing happen to you girls.
- You know rule number two?<eos> - Fresher they are, the faster they are.<eos> Yes, but since all of our shufflers date back to the war, that doesn't really matter out here.<eos> - Rule number three--<eos> If you don't shoot them in the head, you are pretty much dead.<eos> What do you think we are? Newbs?<eos> On the left, you can see some of our other guests at their shooting spot.<eos> Yeah! Not bad shooting.<eos> Don't want to make you look bad, guys.<eos> Let me show you how it's done.
- The undead-rights activists.<eos> What did you do to get in the system?<eos> I just typed some codes that they gave me.<eos> And I used this.<eos> Look, I don't even know what's on it.<eos> It's encrypted. Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> You've been played.<eos> While you were downloading whatever, they uploaded some shit.<eos> So all these people are dead because of you?<eos> Oh, come on. Do you honestly think I would be here with you if I knew this was gonna happen?
(Deering) I want all officers on leave recalling.<eos> If they're pulling sickies, set their car alarms off and see how fast they can reach the pavement, then drag 'em in and get 'em up to date.<eos> Hello!<eos> Detective Inspector Deering and DC Kowalska.<eos> - This is taking the piss.<eos> I thought they were the other shoes. Oh, hello.<eos> It's only us, and it were open.<eos> Oh, deary, deary, 999.<eos> Little ratty's last supper.<eos> Are any of you Cathy? Is Cathy here?
Two PhDs in industrial chemistry.<eos> Her tax returns say that she's a supply science teacher.<eos> You couldn't get a bra in that joint for less than 200 sods.<eos> This is 4:30pm.<eos> Angelina Costeros arrives back at number 24.<eos> Wait for it.<eos> Three minutes later she's at the upstairs window of number 22 with her baps out.<eos> - They're not shagging at all. - (Laughter)<eos> So we know the two houses are connected. We just don't know how.<eos> Yeah, I'd like to introduce you to the shit button.
- I'm what? - With Joy.<eos> - What?<eos> But you said it was me!<eos> (Deering) And learn your lines. I want you word perfect.<eos> Cues, lines, performance.<eos> Shouldn't one of you two mention consequences to her?<eos> Wow.<eos> You know, I'm keeping this one.<eos> Sorry, ladies.<eos> I need to fit you with... recording equipment.
I know.<eos> We all need to know how to be good at that, don't we?<eos> Fighting back?<eos> So...<eos> Happy reading.<eos> Me dad bought me a first edition of that when I were 12.<eos> Within a week, a bloke came up behind me. I wasn't a good eater in them days.<eos> Wham, I caught him, straight in the sprouts with a bunch of bike keys.<eos> I still read that on holiday every year.<eos> And I've signed it for you.
- I'm Teresa.<eos> Alright, Teresa.<eos> There is a man out there who wants girls like you dead and bobbing up and down in the river like apples.<eos> Now, I'm sorry, but we need you all to be scared of this guy.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - We are.<eos> - You tease.<eos> You absolutely love it. - Hello?<eos> Is that Stuart's dad? - T.<eos> What's going on between you and him?
I never once put a foot wrong, and she still had his ear more than me!<eos> Majid, you just drop-kicked yourself into a life sentence.<eos> Don't bother having the last word. And she had such a hairy fucking cunt from day fucking one!<eos> - (Majid) Fuck off!<eos> Take a bow, lady, take a bow.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, these are on me.<eos> - Oh, thanks, ma'am.<eos> Do I pick 'em or do I pick 'em?<eos> You are not still sulking about that call I made to your old man?<eos> It was a joke. And what's going on between you two anyway?
With perfect clarity, Your Majesty.<eos> A solar eclipse is like God putting his hand over the sun.<eos> Can't help being nervous.<eos> There's nothing to be scared of.<eos> I know that.<eos> It's just a feeling.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Protection for your eyes, Your Majesty. - Thank you very much.<eos> - How wonderful.<eos> Now I can stare at you without being dazzled, Sire.
Porthos.<eos> There is no escape.<eos> You should have gone to the old fort with the King.<eos> Your place is at his side.<eos> I had duties here.<eos> I don't need watching over. If that's what you're doing.<eos> The idea never crossed my mind.<eos> This place has been my home for too long.<eos> It's time for a change.<eos> End this now and the King might yet grant you clemency.
I'll do it.<eos> You understand the rules.<eos> There can be no second chances. No pleading or negotiation.<eos> The immutable laws of chance must dictate the outcome.<eos> Frankly, I would rather be dead than listen to your endless babble for one more minute.<eos> Very well.<eos> Call your fate.<eos> Milady, don't do it. Don't play his game.<eos> I'm touched by your concern.<eos> I order you not to risk your life, Milady.
I order you not to risk your life, Milady.<eos> Well, perhaps I can help.<eos> Heads.<eos> I call heads.<eos> You win.<eos> - You may go.<eos> - I forbid it.<eos> If the King cannot have his freedom, no one can.<eos> The rules must be obeyed.<eos> I order you to stay, Milady!
And if we only had wings we could fly out of the window.<eos> You think me cruel. But life is cruel.<eos> One person lives. Another dies.<eos> There is no reason or rhyme to it.<eos> We make our choices and then fate intervenes.<eos> How could fate intervene?<eos> We all share the same fate, the same luck.<eos> There's nothing anyone can do about that.<eos> But some of us have the dice loaded in our favour by wealth and privilege.<eos> Some of you don't know what it is to make harsh choices.
In your ease and comfort, you have never had to face them.<eos> Life is about choice, Marmion, it can't be avoided.<eos> Now, some choices are unpleasant and they have to be made.<eos> But there are always consequences.<eos> My point exactly.<eos> And a king's choices are the hardest of all.<eos> I am glad to see you engaging in the spirit of the game.<eos> Take them.<eos> Not my son.<eos> I beg you not to harm him.
The thought of her kept me alive.<eos> I never had you down as the romantic type.<eos> Because you know nothing about me.<eos> True.<eos> You and this woman...<eos> Did you two, uh, get together when you got out?<eos> She is married.<eos> But her feelings for me haven't changed.<eos> Who is she?<eos> As if I would tell you.
His first concern will be the safety of the Dauphin.<eos> Make sure you stay close to me.<eos> So how does this end, Marmion? Hmm?<eos> You kill us all and then what?<eos> What have you achieved?<eos> Balance.<eos> A harmony in nature.<eos> A shout of defiance in the face of an indifferent universe.<eos> If I'm going to die for a cause, I'd like to know what it is.<eos> Does the name Gerberoy mean anything to you?
They're not here to tell me.<eos> We are all that's left of our village.<eos> We should have died, but we didn't.<eos> We were kept alive for a purpose.<eos> Gerberoy is gone.<eos> But we shall see it is never forgotten.<eos> I heard you broke a window. Better that than my neck.<eos> Athos.<eos> Oh, Your Majesty. Thank God you're safe.<eos> It's good to see you, Captain.
To spend every moment as a living corpse.<eos> You never intended for us to leave, did you?<eos> You mean for us to die here.<eos> You can still turn back from the brink.<eos> Look it's not too late, Jacques.<eos> Jacques died in Gerberoy.<eos> I am Marmion.<eos> Untie her.<eos> No you can't, you can't.<eos> Please don't harm her. I beg you, please.
Jacques died in Gerberoy.<eos> I am Marmion.<eos> Untie her.<eos> No you can't, you can't.<eos> Please don't harm her. I beg you, please.<eos> Time to make another choice, Your Majesty.<eos> Call correctly and the woman goes free.<eos> And get it wrong and she dies.<eos> No. Why?<eos> What has she ever done to you?
No.<eos> You can't kill a man who is already dead. Hmm.<eos> I've never much cared for riddles.<eos> The traitor Marmion is dead.<eos> Rochefort, you are a hero.<eos> Your prompt arrival saved me.<eos> While you encouraged that madman to gamble with my life.<eos> I had to stall him, Sire. It's all I could think of.<eos> I admit you played a brave part, but it was a very dangerous game.<eos> Thank God you are well, Sire.
- He had no right to do this to me!<eos> - Easy. Five bloody times this has happened to me before.<eos> - You've run over five people?<eos> - No, on the trains, love. Driver for 20 years.<eos> I've got post bleeding trauma cos of folk like him walking onto the tracks, the big goodbye.<eos> You're saying he deliberately stepped in front of your car?<eos> Split second before I hit him, and all I see is him mouthing "sorry" and then wham.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Like that's gonna make it all better.<eos> I know a lot of you have pulled all-nighters, you're running on fumes, but there's that window between when he grabs 'em and when he kills 'em.
You did the son. Now you're gonna do the father.<eos> - You can fuck off, an' all.<eos> - Yeah, fine by me.<eos> You sure you're alright?<eos> That was some hit.<eos> Look, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry I froze back there.<eos> No, it was great.<eos> See, that's my job.<eos> If any of you lot freeze, I have to act, and I knew that before but it suddenly all just clicked.
They've even taken the cooker, the twats.<eos> He's way too smart to come back here.<eos> Unless he thought Elizabeth had.<eos> I thought you'd used up all your holidays?<eos> Ma'am.<eos> 'DI Deering calling all available officers.'<eos> The number on the collar of the uniform we gave him - 22047.<eos> It's negative on that, ma'am.<eos> We just found his epaulettes and service jumper in the centre of town.<eos> You sound like you're in Cafe Pacific.
~ I love you.<eos> ~ 'I love you! '<eos> ~ No, say it separately.<eos> ~ 'I love you.' ~ 'I love you.'<eos> Erm, it's going to be a bit of a long one, girls. But I'll kiss you both night-night when I get in, OK?<eos> 'OK! '<eos> All right. Break the bad news to your mum.<eos> Tell her I'll call her in half an hour.<eos> 'OK! '<eos> ~ I love you both. ~ 'Night-night.' ~ 'Night-night!
Sir, if you wanna just come over.<eos> Look, you'll see...<eos> Yeah?<eos> Clear as day.<eos> (MacLaren) How did he get past the camera in the pub?<eos> Cos he's a sneaky little worm.<eos> Pop goes the alibi.<eos> I thought you said being gay would rule him out as the killer.<eos> If you brought me proof that he was gay, I'd still be inclined to rule him out.<eos> I give you a profile to help point you in the right direction.
- You really think you're safe in here?<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> - Safe from Shane Mercy?<eos> - Shane's done nothing. - Not to you.<eos> What about Kieran?<eos> - Was he safe in here?<eos> - That was different, though.<eos> How was that?<eos> How was it different for Kieran?<eos> You and Stuart, why don't you get a room, the pair of you?
No, Ma'am, no.<eos> We both did what we thought was right.<eos> Jonah, this is not the time to be...<eos> No, if Ruth were Tegan or Taz or Stuart, would you do the same?<eos> It's neither of us or both of us.<eos> It has to be.<eos> Come on!<eos> Dinah?<eos> ~ Hi, guys. ~ All right.<eos> ~ You all right?
No.<eos> So you did notice who it was.<eos> Well, I was half-asleep, of course, but I thought it was your father, the King, who tied me.<eos> Why?<eos> Fetch me a knife.<eos> There will have to be an inquest.<eos> Athenian spies do not escape out of my prisons.<eos> Should I call the Captain of the Guard? Yes.<eos> I hope her interpretations of your dreams were worth it.<eos> All right. I'm sick of both of you.
How could you possibly know?<eos> I no longer feel the beast gnawing at my soul.<eos> "Beast"?<eos> Listen carefully.<eos> You're not to speak of this to anyone.<eos> Run. Hide in the forests of Troezen or the sacred mountains to the north.<eos> Do not hurt the boy, or you will be punished by the gods of the ancients.<eos> Raise him in secret until I find you.<eos> How will you find us?<eos> This will lead me to you.
What are we going to do?<eos> To start with, I was hoping you'd do a better job of convincing your new son to work with me to solve the Lexicon.<eos> He's a savage! A creature of the woods!<eos> Remember... we can't force him.<eos> He has to give himself willingly.<eos> I shall have to try a different tack.<eos> You're not at all what I expected.<eos> Queen Medea.<eos> So you know who I am.<eos> I should thank you.
- No. Yeah, you are.<eos> I grew up around a bunch of liars.<eos> If I have one talent in the world, it's knowing when someone is lying.<eos> And you are a liar.<eos> Look, I just can't get into it here.<eos> Then that's what you should have said.<eos> - It's complicated.<eos> - Don't care.<eos> I want to take this opportunity to welcome you all to the first class of the Midwest Institute for the Deaf at UMKC!<eos> I know a lot of you had other options, bigger programs with longer track records. But we hope to offer you something different.

But we hope to offer you something different.<eos> A family feel.<eos> The first year of college is amazing.<eos> It's exciting to be independent and away from home.<eos> But it can be scary, and it's easy to feel alone.<eos> But I want you to know that you are not alone.<eos> I am here.<eos> Lily is here.<eos> The people on the left and right of you right now are your new family.

Yeah, your show is completely addictive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Fellow crime geek. - Totally.<eos> I'm Noah Foster.<eos> This is Audrey.<eos> She's shy.<eos> You look really familiar.<eos> You probably saw my video.<eos> So, I'm trying to get past all of the faux-BFF BS and get a clear picture of the real Nina Patterson.<eos> Did any of you know her? Yeah.
All I have was won by the strength of kings, not the promises of gods.<eos> Right now, the most powerful woman in the civilized world is also the most powerless in your company.<eos> Whatever you do to me,<eos> I cannot defend myself. No.<eos> If I raise a hand, there'll be a hundred spears at my throat.<eos> Guards? Guards!<eos> See? We are alone.<eos> I am indeed fortunate to lose my virginity to one so skilled in the art of love.<eos> Leda and the Swan. That was Zeus.<eos> But if Zeus is only in my imagination, then I shall replace him with you,
Now, let's not just limit ourselves.<eos> We can... choose something contemporary, like movies.<eos> Audrey and Will.<eos> If you suggest the pool scene from Wild Things, I will end you.<eos> Or, if that's too much for your attention span, pick a favorite TV show, Riley and Noah.<eos> I'll even allow popular fiction, Jake and Brooke.<eos> How about Fifty Shades of Grey?<eos> In your dreams, mouth-breather. All right, everybody.<eos> Let's get going to the library,<eos> I'm gonna pair the rest of you up there.
- Where are you?<eos> - I did it.<eos> I got my phone back.<eos> Everything's fine. I fixed it.<eos> How do you know?<eos> How do you know everything's going to be fixed?<eos> It just is, all right?<eos> - Why are you whispering?<eos> - Is she coming back?<eos> I just wanted you to know you don't have to worry.
I thought I could circulate it, an effort to trigger someone...<eos> Anyone else's memory.<eos> They'd see the cover, a hint of memory...<eos> They pick up the book, read it.<eos> The suppressed memories surface, and they'd find their way to me to discover more.<eos> Just like you did.<eos> Did it work with anyone else?<eos> You didn't see it on The New York Times best seller list, did you?<eos> So all we have to do is read the book?<eos> If you've seen them, if they've done something to you, then the book will help you remember.
I speak for them.<eos> What do you know of the seventh one of their kind?<eos> The... the seventh?<eos> The one you call the Master.<eos> You injured him.<eos> How do you know this?<eos> The seven share a common mind.<eos> But the seventh... has the power to disrupt thought.<eos> When you injured him, he lost control, so they saw you fighting.<eos> And now, he has recovered enough to shield himself from you once again.
You hurt him, you know?<eos> The Master, you wounded him.<eos> You shouldn't feel like you failed.<eos> Newton's third law states - that for every action - _ there is an equal and opposite reaction.<eos> Write carefully.<eos> Newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.<eos> Children, close your work and listen to me for one minute.<eos> Given everything that's going on, we have decided to relocate the institute to outside of the city.<eos> Now, the National Guard is in the process of setting up checkpoints at all of the bridges and all of the tunnels leading out of the city, but thanks to our generous sponsors at the Stoneheart Foundation, we've gotten a transit pass out of Manhattan.<eos> So, those of you whose parents we've managed to contact, you will be picked up here at the school.
To those we've lost and to those we shall soon find.<eos> It's poison!<eos> It was the sky people.<eos> This wasn't us.<eos> You have to know this wasn't us.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> We didn't do this.<eos> Gustus warned me about you, But I didn't listen.
What are you doing?<eos> She didn't poison anyone.<eos> I argued for all of you to die, but the commander is merciful.<eos> She wants only one.<eos> - She's innocent.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> They move, they bleed.<eos> Hey, hey, stop.<eos> Let her go.<eos> The rest of you are free.
I'm not going down there. You are.<eos> Well, untie me then.<eos> I can't breathe. Good.<eos> I'm running out of rope. Get me some more.<eos> What you need is a pulley system.<eos> Reminds me of the time I hauled two oxen through a four-story window.<eos> Steady on.<eos> How much further?<eos> More.<eos> One of you has to go down there to fetch him back up.
It feels a little strange.<eos> The instruments of power are as mysterious as they are burdensome.<eos> It doesn't feel right.<eos> You'll get used to it.<eos> Perhaps, but only when it's time.<eos> That time might come at any moment, and when it does, you, Majesty, must be ready.<eos> "Majesty?"<eos> Don't be silly, uncle Pallas.<eos> King.<eos> The Gods have chosen you to carry their light.

Stop it.
That's a terrible waste, son of Aegeus.<eos> I wonder which god wore it.<eos> Whoever it was didn't wear it on their finger.<eos> Why not?<eos> The Gods wouldn't have built such large temples unless they were 10 times the size of man.<eos> What is it?<eos> Someone's out there.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Majesty.<eos> Your priests ask that you lead the tribute to Apollo and carry his eternal flame.
Let that be a lesson to you.<eos> What'd you guys even do?<eos> We had some fun.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good night, Janey.<eos> Sleep tight, Janey.<eos> Good night.<eos> Shit.<eos> Sorry you have to sleep next to that tonight.<eos> What happened with you guys?
Oh, Ezra.<eos> Oh, my love.<eos> Can I bum a cigarette?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - It looks like it'll be another... beautiful day in Southern California.<eos> Ray...<eos> I... I have a disease, okay?<eos> That guy in there with his cock and balls zip-tied, that guy wasn't me.<eos> That guy was my addict.<eos> Yeah, well, one of you owes me $2000.
Okay.<eos> Why are you interested in her?<eos> Answer the question.<eos> She likes extra towels for her hair.<eos> Still not an answer.<eos> She's a nice girl.<eos> She believes in God.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she's pure.<eos> That's how you people like it, right?
We need to go talk to God.<eos> ID check.<eos> Our pain is your redemption.<eos> Let us suffer for your sins.<eos> Our pain, your redemption.<eos> Let us suffer for your sins.<eos> Our pain, your redemption.<eos> Let us suffer for sins.<eos> Our pain, your redemption. Let us suffer...<eos> I can give you 10 minutes.
If I knew how to beg, I'd do that, too.<eos> What's your take on the state of things in the Quad these days? Westerlyns aren't happy.<eos> VVesterlyns want war.<eos> More and more of them every day.<eos> To cut our ties to Qresh and the Company for good.<eos> Isn't that what you want?<eos> War is what they call it when the big dogs win. I want a revolution.<eos> We're not ready.<eos> If agitators like Rolly step too soon, the Company will squash us all. Again.<eos> I'll help you find him.
Today's the day.<eos> This is it.<eos> All right guys, I wanna talk to you about something.
Today's the day.<eos> This is it.<eos> All right guys, I wanna talk to you about something.<eos> This isn't easy for me, but I'm... I'm turning 24 today, and I think it's just time I told you the truth.
that's not you.<eos> It's the excessive alcohol.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> I'm hurt, man.<eos> Adam's gay.<eos> I gotta take a shit.<eos> I... i should just head out. -No, no, no, no.<eos> -No, no. It's cool. I'm gonna go.<eos> -It's okay.<eos> Let you guys soak it in. -No, Adam. No, dude.
I mean, I just thought you had really oddly high standards in women. I do.<eos> They just need to be dudes.<eos> So...<eos> Why didn't you tell me before?<eos> Well, I tried to tell you guys last night.<eos> No man, I mean like, way the fuck before.<eos> I don't know.<eos> -Your parents know?<eos> -No.<eos> It's hard enough telling you guys.
Maybe it's tricia.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Should I text her that?<eos> No, it's like 4ªm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right.<eos> You get any dudes' numbers tonight?<eos> -No.<eos> -What?<eos> I was too busy dancing with you guys.
You're so sexy.<eos> Just like a burly Benjamin Franklin.<eos> Did you guys know Benjamin Franklin died of syphilis?<eos> Fact.<eos> He did.<eos> Hey, well worth the risk.<eos> So do you guys know where Chris is?<eos> I texted earlier, but he's being flaky as shit, so...<eos> Yeah. I haven't talked to him for a while, but I'm sure he's gonna show up.<eos> What's going on with you two guys?
Well... The press know even less than the police do. They just make things up as they go along...<eos> Hurting innocent people, ruining lives.<eos> Did you know Tom was yours? I'm sorry.<eos> Um, I have no business asking that question.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I didn't...<eos> Until after.<eos> It must have been devastating.<eos> You probably have some idea.<eos> I mean, after Malcolm was taken from you.
Yeah.<eos> No surprise that Crystal of yours ain't been taking good care of you.<eos> It's Christy.<eos> Whatever happened to Kelly, that one you used to run with?<eos> Always liked that one.<eos> I'd rather pass a gallstone than believe any of that trash they're saying about you on TV.<eos> What did I do now?<eos> You have a visitor.<eos> Best stand back.<eos> What's going on with you two?
This must be the beacon that called us.<eos> Somebody planted it.<eos> Pirate bait.<eos> McDowell was right.<eos> Hoss, forwarding you an A-1 tight-beam from the Canterbury.<eos> Holden, a ship just appeared near your location.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> You cleared us out to a million clicks.<eos> It didn't show up on any of our scopes.<eos> We're setting you a rendezvous point.
What if they don't like being followed?<eos> They slip off that screen, they're gone forever.<eos> They'll get away with this.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> I gave an order! You think rank matters now?<eos> Get up, I'll do it myself.<eos> Get up!<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> Whoa, whoa! Let's just take a deep breath here, people.<eos> All of you.
Calling the shots again.<eos> I'm going outside.<eos> You got a problem with that?<eos> Amos, go with him.<eos> Let's just hold on for one second.<eos> We don't have to go outside.<eos> We're safe right now.<eos> We open those doors, we're done.<eos> The ship could crack apart.<eos> I'm telling you...
Come on, kid.<eos> Is that everything you got?<eos> Hey...<eos> Hey! Doing my work, cop.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa!<eos> What are you punks doing stealing up-tunnel water?<eos> Free sample.<eos> All piss and vinegar.<eos> You know, you're lucky it's us chasing you and not the Greigas.<eos> They would feed you your fingers, for playin' in their district.
You look very well-treated.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> I flew with the Mars Navy for 20 years before I shipped off on the Cant.<eos> Oh, so... so you're helping them?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa there, Chief.<eos> Settle down. They let me clean up out of respect.<eos> Respect?<eos> Yeah, they told me.<eos> They told me a lot a stuff.<eos> Made me realize, I don't know a good goddamn about you.
For all we know, he could be working out a deal.<eos> Yeah, for himself.<eos> The only thing I see here is an incoming ship.<eos> One you can't even identify.<eos> How do you know they're coming for Naomi?<eos> We don't.<eos> It's a guess.<eos> And you're just guessing Naomi's OPA, too.<eos> We both know that's better than a guess.<eos> She is the best liar amongst all of you, by far.
Do you miss Earth?<eos> If I did, I'd go back.<eos> My great-uncle emigrated from Earth.<eos> He missed it terribly.<eos> He used to tell me stories when I was a little boy about these endless blue skies, free air everywhere.<eos> Open water all the way to the horizon.<eos> He told me that someday we would make Mars just like that.<eos> When you spend your whole life living under a dome, even the idea of an ocean seems impossible to imagine.<eos> I could never understand your people.<eos> Why, when the universe had bestowed so much upon you, you seemed to care so little for it.
Whatever Bo's plan is, we'll give one helluva fight.<eos> Who needs weapons when we have mascara and heels.<eos> Hey those Louboutin's could take an eye out.<eos> Vex, where do you keep your tweezers, and duct tape, your pharmaceuticals...<eos> Watch out!<eos> Hey, let's get something straight, as long as we're in my motorized caravan, they'll be no backseat driving, alright?<eos> Hey, put those back!<eos> You know, of all the creepy fetishes, how is this your weirdest, hmm?<eos> I'll have you know that's German Weimar porcelain.<eos> I've got a life outside of you people.
No, not in a million years.<eos> But you did.<eos> I was there.<eos> And I'll be there when you control it now.<eos> I will always be there.<eos> My mom wasn't able to suck the Dark Lord's Chi.<eos> How can I fight him?<eos> Why didn't you kill us?<eos> Hmm, what made you come back?<eos> All of you.
But you did.<eos> I was there.<eos> And I'll be there when you control it now.<eos> I will always be there.<eos> My mom wasn't able to suck the Dark Lord's Chi.<eos> How can I fight him?<eos> Why didn't you kill us?<eos> Hmm, what made you come back?<eos> All of you.<eos> I remember how each of you taste.
Easy.<eos> Control your breathing.<eos> Squeeze the trigger.<eos> Don't pull it.<eos> Sir, we got an audience.<eos> Hold your fire.<eos> Keep a solid stance.<eos> Observe.<eos> Would you like to try?<eos> I could teach you.
Maybe we should, too.<eos> Stand down.<eos> Open the gate now.<eos> Can you hear me all right?<eos> Because I need to make sure you get this.<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> I have a message for your leader.<eos> We're coming for him.<eos> You're watching us, but you haven't seen a thing.<eos> The Grouder army is bigger than you think, and even if you could find it, your acid fog can't hurt them, and now, thanks to you... Neither can the reapers.
What are you doing?<eos> Get away from him.<eos> I said get away from him!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I can't fight it.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> We can.<eos> I betrayed your brother.<eos> He's a prisoner in the mountain because of me.<eos> Lincoln, I don't know what happened between you two, But bellamy made it, he's fine.
John, we have no weapons and no rations.<eos> If we go north and you're wrong, Then all of us will die.<eos> If we turn back now, we live.<eos> So that's it?<eos> We've reached the point of no return? You just want to give up?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> You didn't not say it either.<eos> That is the north star.<eos> After you.<eos> The rest of you need to decide for yourselves, But either way, we'll come back for you When we find it.
So we're gonna split up. No.<eos> We do this together.<eos> We survive together.<eos> Bellamy's right.<eos> Well, they don't trust Maya anymore.<eos> Who the hell is gonna help us now?<eos> They are.<eos> We're going to hide you.<eos> Not everyone here agrees with Cage, not no a long shot.<eos> Come with ,me. We'll divide you along the way. Let's go.
No.<eos> No more wasted lives.<eos> In 48 hours, we will all be on the ground.<eos> Take off the the hoods.<eos> No.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - Nate!<eos> No!<eos> You bastards!<eos> What is wrong with you people?
Get off me!<eos> Please don't.<eos> No, no...<eos> Hello, Clarke.<eos> Sir, we need your help again.<eos> It's ok.<eos> I took out the camera from the junction box in the hall.<eos> We can talk freely.<eos> No one's watching, anyway.<eos> Thanks to you, they're all on level 5.
No one's watching, anyway.<eos> Thanks to you, they're all on level 5.<eos> - You're not.<eos> - No.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Please.<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> We need a way to get our people out of this mountain without killing everyone.<eos> He's not gonna help us.<eos> You cut the power, risking the lives of everyone in this mountain... my people, even the ones who helped you.
Please, whoever you are, we need your help.<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> John...<eos> I can't make it.<eos> Just go, all right?<eos> We both know you want to.<eos> I'll come back for you, John.<eos> Your promised land sucks!<eos> I told you, there's no one here.
She's out of air.<eos> First, you need to close the door.<eos> Time to spare.<eos> She's safe.<eos> Could we go now?<eos> I'll be ok.<eos> Look. I'm not leaving you.<eos> - Jasper.<eos> - She's alive, but she's not safe.<eos> Cage knows I helped you guys. He's on level 5.
Terry!<eos> What's going on, baby?<eos> Where's Bridget?<eos> What?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why would Bridget be here?<eos> Terry!<eos> Come on in.<eos> Take your pants off.<eos> Is Bridget with you?
Maybe it's true...<eos> She is living here now...<eos> But we can always visit her.<eos> It's nice that we were allowed to leave earlier, but why actually?<eos> I can only guess: Several guys were absent today then the teacher told us not to drink the water.<eos> But we never did it anyway.<eos> Yeah, the water has a weird smell.<eos> Have you heard that Demian and his family are leaving the town?<eos> No.<eos> He invites everyone to his place today and asked me to tell you.
With us asking the questions and me taking the personal pleasure of carving the answers out of you.<eos> Just... whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Hold on there, badass.<eos> Lighten up.<eos> Why do you just assume I'm not gonna be helpful?<eos> Because you're a dickwad.<eos> But I'm your dickwad.<eos> I have a special place in my... non-heart for you both, to which end...<eos> ta-da! ...<eos> I would be tickled to help you pop this biblical zit.
After my mom split and went crazy, Randy was like a father to me.<eos> First I lose my first dad, then I lose my second, and who killed him and trashed my life?<eos> The buddy of the guy who killed my first dad and wants to be my third dad. Wow.<eos> Sounds just like my life.<eos> Complications and pain...<eos> that's all family gets you.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's why me and Tony keep moving... no strings.<eos> Hey, why don't you hang with us for awhile and unload this whole mess?<eos> Um, you might want to reconsider.
Now, that is a truly odd question.<eos> Last time I checked, I was a 10.<eos> Boys?<eos> Now, I'm gonna go ahead and guess the boys are an 11 and not a 2, which would make them toddlers.<eos> Now, unless there's some law been broken, think it's time for us to be on our way.<eos> I promised the boys' wives I'd have them home for supper, and I am, if nothing else, a man of my word.<eos> Okay.<eos> I got your names and your plate number.<eos> I'm gonna radio ahead and make sure you make it out of State.<eos> If not, I'm gonna put out an APB and have you boys rounded up.
He said the check bounced.<eos> Insufficient funds.<eos> So I call over there, and...<eos> We agreed, right?<eos> Well, we never...<eos> I thought...<eos> You told me.<eos> But I never...<eos> Well, now there's another buyer up in Sleepy Eye and he's gonna get the shop.<eos> Well, he can't do that. You shook on it.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> My husband wants to thank you for coming. Of course.
What's wrong with him, then? - He had a stroke.<eos> - A mild stroke.<eos> He can't walk or talk.<eos> For now, he can't.<eos> One day, though.<eos> He's still... same lion inside. But until he's better, you talk to me.<eos> That's right.<eos> Talk to Ma.<eos> She's in charge.<eos> Also, we want to thank you for your cards and letters. Are you kidding me?
Still got 26 minutes.<eos> And that, by no strange coincidence, is the amount of time it'll take me to rouse Judge Peabody from his bed and have him dismiss these unfounded charges.<eos> No charges as of yet.<eos> Held without charges!<eos> Even better.<eos> Then I shall have to tell His Honor to boost my client from these baseless restraints you've shackled him under! Whoa!<eos> Hey, you're not driving, are you?<eos> My choices outside this building are none of your...<eos> But, no, Sonny valeted me here tonight.<eos> But now, now I must bid you all adieu and admonish you to watch your proverbial butts, for I shall be back with the sledgehammer of justice, prepared to lay Joseph waste to these four walls, if you so much as touch a hair on my client's...
Government should uphold and not undermine those institutions which are custodians of the very values upon which civilization is founded, religion, education, and above all, family.<eos> Weak.<eos> We who are privileged to be Americans have had a rendezvous with destiny since the moment in 1630 when John Winthrop, standing on the deck of the tiny Arbella off the coast of Massachusetts, told that little band of pilgrims,<eos> "We shall be as a city upon a hill."<eos> A troubled and afflicted mankind looks to us, pleading for us to keep our rendezvous with destiny, that we will uphold the principles of self-reliance, self-discipline, morality, and above all, responsible liberty for every individual.<eos> That we will become that shining city on a hill.<eos> My friends, I believe that you and I together can keep this rendezvous with destiny.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Everyone, thank you.
Which means your big break still hasn't happened yet.<eos> I'm so happy for you.<eos> I love you both so much, even though I don't always say it.<eos> - Thank you, Lillian.<eos> - Oh, we love you, too.<eos> Huh? No, no, no.<eos> Wheel of Fortune.<eos> I'd like to solve the puzzle, Pat.<eos> "I'm so happy for you.<eos> I love both of you so much, even though I don't always pay it?"
She's been smiling and looking all around.<eos> I think she likes it here.<eos> It feels like home.<eos> Do you want to hold her?<eos> I know this all must be pretty overwhelming, but some advice I learned from developmental psych...<eos> Happy mom, happy dad, happy baby.<eos> Look. I know that this won't be easy...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?<eos> Hayley, if you would join me, I'd like to propose a toast.<eos> I want to welcome you all.
Happy mom, happy dad, happy baby.<eos> Look. I know that this won't be easy...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?<eos> Hayley, if you would join me, I'd like to propose a toast.<eos> I want to welcome you all.<eos> As you know, last spring, Hayley and I had a daughter.<eos> Due to tragic circumstance, she was lost.<eos> Now she has returned home.<eos> Her name is Hope.<eos> She will live here among you, her pack, her family.
All I can recall is his terrible temper his awful cruelty.<eos> - Especially to Klaus.<eos> - That is not an excuse.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> I know that Klaus can be infuriating, treacherous even but there is no one better to have by your side against someone like Dahlia.<eos> Klaus wants Hope safe just as much as you want your freedom.<eos> - We need to work together.<eos> - How can you defend him?<eos> I was abducted by Dahlia, spent years under her control and yet he acts as if I am the enemy.<eos> I have given you all every reason to trust me and still Klaus rejects me.
If things go south, that dagger might come in handy.<eos> Kol gave me that dagger for my protection.<eos> I'll be the one who decides if it gets used.<eos> I have to get back to work.<eos> Your transparent attempts to therapize me failed, brother.<eos> I suggest you allow me to make my way home in peace.<eos> Enough of the games, Niklaus.<eos> Now is not the time.<eos> Must I beseech you to stand with us?<eos> If by "us" you mean you and Freya then I will not be standing with you.
- Niklaus, this is insane.<eos> Hope is also my family.<eos> Now, if you continue to walk this path, you will lead her towards harm.<eos> And do not fail to understand me when I say this to you:<eos> I will do whatever it takes to prevent this.<eos> So will I.<eos> So the choice remains yours, brother:<eos> Freya or me.<eos> Yeah, so Davina says Hope shouldn't be able to do any magic if she's wearing that.<eos> And, oh, to tell you good luck.
You did good, Aiden.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wait, there's something I need to...<eos> Look, the reason you didn't get out of the compound last night was because of me.<eos> - You can't control traffic, buddy.<eos> - No, I... I did it on purpose.<eos> For Klaus.<eos> He sucked me in. He appealed to my stupid ego. Told me everything that I wanted to hear.<eos> Okay, last night, he wanted me to watch you guys.<eos> Jackson, if I had let you escape, he would've killed me, but...
Okay.<eos> If you need to take some time like I did, do it.<eos> But you'll always be a part of this pack.<eos> Okay? I'm not ready to lose you yet.<eos> Jackson. Uh...<eos> Just take care of yourself.<eos> You know, and watch your back with Klaus.<eos> Come here, you idiot.<eos> [AIDEN LAUGHS]<eos> Of course I tried to call you, Elijah.
Where Dahlia sent Josephine this morning. We'd be sitting ducks just like we will be here as soon as that spell breaks.<eos> Which is why we have to go.<eos> Jackson is out getting supplies. We're taking the wolves and we're headed to the bayou.<eos> The swamp. So my child can be protected by the very wolves Dahlia so easily defeated.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> You know, I am so over taking advice from you, Klaus.<eos> All it has done so far is put Hope in danger.<eos> From now on, I am gonna do what I wanna do.<eos> We're leaving.<eos> You're not going anywhere unless I tell you to.
- Let her through.<eos> I'm actually glad you're here.<eos> Freya.<eos> I saw her. Dahlia.<eos> She intends to make her move tonight.<eos> Klaus and our father will be her next victims.<eos> And you have returned to warn the very people who would cast you out.<eos> I understand Klaus' mistrust, as I do yours.<eos> But I did not come this far to see my family die at the hands of the very evil that I've tried for so long to escape.<eos> I'm begging you. Help me save them.
I'd know that wicked tongue anywhere.<eos> What mischief have you gotten yourself into now?<eos> - No doubt the bastard's doing.<eos> - Enough.<eos> My patience, like this farce of a reunion, is at an end.<eos> Agreed.<eos> There really is only one question here. What exactly are we doing?<eos> This was not my plan.<eos> You rushed it and made but a single weapon.<eos> Of course she took it from you.
I did ask you here in the hopes that you would share some of Dahlia's secrets.<eos> So without further ado, let's get to it. Ahem.<eos> The first thing you should know is that Dahlia's the most powerful witch I have ever seen.<eos> She craves more power still.<eos> Right now, she is like me, limited to one year of life in a century, but she wants to be free of that restriction, to gain true immortality, and that is why she will come here, drawn by your daughter<eos> to take the child's power for herself.<eos> She will kill anyone who would defy her.<eos> And yet you would defy her. I don't have a choice.<eos> She will never let me be free.<eos> My one chance is to align with you and kill her.
That way, we can have them double-checked by an impartial third party, say Davina.<eos> She'd love to prove me wrong.<eos> I doubt she would understand my magic, let alone have the power to execute it.<eos> So you're our only hope then?<eos> Seems rather convenient, doesn't it?<eos> I knew it would be difficult to win your trust, Niklaus.<eos> Your reputation precedes you...<eos> But if we are to face Dahlia together, you will have to trust me.<eos> Given the peril that Rebekah now faces, are you truly incapable of giving me even a chance to prove myself?<eos> I know I appear as an outsider, but I have dreamt of you all for a thousand years.
The road to the highway's flooded.<eos> Quickest way out of here's on foot through back roads.<eos> What's wrong.<eos> Elijah called.<eos> Klaus is gone. We don't know where he went.<eos> That settles it. We got to get out of here.<eos> What about the others?<eos> All right, everybody.<eos> Listen up.<eos> I want to thank you all for staying with us, protecting us.

No matter.<eos> We have all that we need.<eos> Rebekah will perform the spell, using my heartbeat and the golem to craft the illusion of Hope's presence.<eos> Once Dahlia's lured into the killing ground, you will do what is necessary.<eos> You're rather calm, which is odd since there are a million ways this whole plan could fall to pieces.<eos> I admit... At first I was upset when Elijah ignored my plan in favor of his own.<eos> You are all so determined to protect Hope at all cost.<eos> Perhaps I'm envious.<eos> No one ever fought so hard to protect me.<eos> Then I recalled what I saw when I looked inside your mind, the day you all swore and oath to stand by one another always and forever.
You are all so determined to protect Hope at all cost.<eos> Perhaps I'm envious.<eos> No one ever fought so hard to protect me.<eos> Then I recalled what I saw when I looked inside your mind, the day you all swore and oath to stand by one another always and forever.<eos> There's strength in such vows.<eos> I can assure you it has not been free of consequence.<eos> That is an understatement.<eos> Ask me, that vow's been more trouble than it's worth.<eos> And yet here you are, proving my point.<eos> Family defines you even if it does demand sacrifice.
This young lady serves as an opportunity for all of us.<eos> Davina Claire is a remnant of the failed harvest ritual.<eos> Let's not forget she aligned with the vampires.<eos> How many witches died because of her?<eos> She was manipulated.<eos> I mean, the ancestors forgave her. They brought her back to life.<eos> Now that's surely a sign...<eos> She is no regent.<eos> That role was meant for you.<eos> And I already told you I ain't gonna do it.
Freya, help me.<eos> Don't worry, brother.<eos> I won't let them hurt you.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Sleep.<eos> What did you do to him?<eos> Finn is now safe from harm, and his hatred of you can no longer do damage to our cause.<eos> Our cause?<eos> Yes.<eos> Ours. And now if you two can stop arguing long enough, perhaps you'll allow your older sister to offer you a deal.
Previously on "The Originals"...<eos> Dahlia will come here, drawn by your daughter.<eos> She will kill anyone who would defy her.<eos> Yet you would defy her.<eos> My one chance is to align with you and kill her.
Vincent, you're not listening to her.<eos> You haven't been yourself lately.<eos> You're right.<eos> I haven't been, but now that I'm back,<eos> I realize something. The only time I've ever been myself... is when I'm with her. Oh.<eos> No!<eos> What is taking so long?<eos> You didn't tarry when you attempted to kill my child.<eos> I took no joy in that.<eos> I knew if your daughter lived Dahlia would come not only for her but for all of you, and however you may despise me, I would not wish that upon you.
I suppose he thinks I'm more durable in this body, and he is probably right, given we're up against Dahlia.<eos> That's why I'm here. I need your help.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> There is only one witch strong enough to stop Dahlia, and that is my very dead mother Esther.<eos> I need you to use your power as regent to bring her back. No.<eos> I only get one shot at this. I'm using it to bring back Kol.<eos> Please, luv. I promise you, we will find another way.<eos> Yaah!<eos> You are all liars.<eos> Aah! I'm gonna bring back the only one of you who has ever meant anything.
How did he even manage to dose a federal agent?<eos> He didn't.<eos> One of the reporters did.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Was my form off? She's right.<eos> About the reporter.<eos> We need a name-- a name and address on our clumsy reporter.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> I'm coming with you.
Harper.<eos> I'm not sure what you--<eos> Look. I've seen you shooting a red hoodie, I've seen you shooting arrows at people.<eos> You think I don't recognize you with a little extra leather and lace?<eos> Well, I guess I won't be needing this anymore. No.<eos> You'll be needing this.<eos> Here you go.<eos> What's this?<eos> Everything on Brickwell we could salvage from evidence storage.<eos> May be something in there to help you guys figure out where he's holed up in the Glades.
That's the only way to end this.<eos> Then let's end this one way or the other.<eos> Let's go.<eos> My two favorite trick-or-treaters.<eos> Well, look at that.<eos> Didn't anybody tell you Halloween was 3 months ago?<eos> Daniel Brickwell...<eos> You have failed this city.<eos> And you seem to have failed in your maths.<eos> Can't you see there's a lot more of us than there is of you?

He's been back before.<eos> He'll be back again.<eos> Clear.<eos> Found it!<eos> Hong kong military?<eos> Triad.<eos> Chien na wey's men.<eos> The number pattern is consistent with cataloguing numerics.<eos> What kind of catalog?<eos> If I knew, I would be telling you.
Yeah.<eos> I just got some bad news about a friend.<eos> Anyone I know?<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Still freaking out, actually.<eos> Worried about ollie.<eos> I was going to ask you a favor, But it doesn't seem like the right time.<eos> Well, it depends.<eos> What's the favor?<eos> You and the arrow, you're... You're close, right?
He was worried something would happen to me.<eos> I could have killed you! Heh.<eos> It's cute that you think so.<eos> Did you hear anything about ollie?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> Then what are you doing here?<eos> We're in danger, thea.<eos> We need to leave starling city and never return.<eos> Thank you all for coming. But seeing as I'm the reason<eos> None of you are sitting in a prison cell right now, I figure it's the least you can do.

But seeing as I'm the reason<eos> None of you are sitting in a prison cell right now, I figure it's the least you can do.<eos> I know I'm the guy that made all the evidence against you go away, But as you can see, It didn't go too far.<eos> You are all part of my crew now.<eos> And if any of you have a problem with that, I can send a gift wrapped package to the d.A.
No.<eos> No, not really.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Ollie told me that I can't tell anyone.<eos> Whatever it is, you have to be able to talk about it with someone.<eos> Someone who's not your brother.<eos> I killed Sara.<eos> It was Malcolm. - He--<eos> - I know.<eos> And none of you told me?
Because you will die there.<eos> It's like "Mission: Impossible" in here.<eos> Yeah, that's the idea.<eos> Make it impossible for the League to get the drop on us.<eos> I thought Thea got us off their hit list.<eos> Yeah, that was before we put Ra's Al Ghul's daughter in a box.<eos> Taking prisoners now.<eos> Isn't that crossing a line?<eos> Actually, Oliver has an entire prison on Lian Yu.<eos> Maybe I shouldn't have told you that.
You're a sociopath and a liar.<eos> Be that as it may, this will be much quicker for all of us if we could fast-forward through the cynicism and realize that I am telling the truth.<eos> - About what?<eos> - Oliver.<eos> His allegiance with the League is a charade.<eos> Why would you even play with our emotions?<eos> This plan was born the moment Oliver realized that he had to capitulate to Ra's to save Thea.<eos> And instead of sharing this plan with us, he trusted you.<eos> The man who had my sister murdered.<eos> I am better practiced in the art of deception and, no offense, none of you are good actors.
Enough!<eos> You have failed.<eos> Any further attempt to undermine our cause would be futile.<eos> Uh, you see that burning plane there?<eos> We destroyed your city-threatening bio-weapon.<eos> No.<eos> You merely think you did.<eos> Surrender or die.<eos> Oliver, what's going on?<eos> If any of you speak, we're all gonna die.
Is that even a remote possibility?<eos> - Didn't think so.<eos> - We aren't gonna die here.<eos> - Oliver would never let that happen.<eos> - He let this happen.<eos> Wah-reeth al Ghul commands your presence.<eos> Leave us.<eos> - Is everyone okay?<eos> - Like you give a damn.<eos> - Didn't Malcolm speak to you?
You'll have to deliver the cure subcutaneously, in the exact ratio I give you.<eos> - You may want to write this down.<eos> - You don't need to tell us.<eos> You're coming with us.<eos> This is so beautiful and yet so dangerous.<eos> Much like its former owner.<eos> Sarab's former love. Who is now my prisoner, along with Al Sah-him's former friends.<eos> You see, their treachery was anticipated.<eos> Yours, however, Al Sa-her, is disappointing because I expected more loyalty from a man whose daughter I saved.<eos> The last time I appeared before you in chains, I offered my fealty. And I am here to offer it again.
And now all I want to do is give that back help you be the person you can be without Oliver without your father and without me.<eos> Living on the run from the police isn't the life you deserve, Thea.<eos> It's not what Oliver gave up his life for you to have.<eos> Whatever happens with me, I will always love you.<eos> PS, thanks for the suit, but I always thought red was more your color anyway."<eos> What did Oliver say to you?<eos> Nothing worth hearing.<eos> You were right about Oliver.<eos> I should have listened to you.<eos> - I told you about Oliver.
The cure, he needs it now!<eos> Akio, please wake up.<eos> Please wake up.<eos> He was dead the moment he was exposed.<eos> - But you said...<eos> - There is no cure.<eos> - Then what the hell is that?<eos> - Insulin. I'm diabetic.<eos> I want to thank you for bringing me here.<eos> It would have taken us weeks to track you all down.
- I got eyes on them.<eos> Blues everywhere.<eos> Keep them pinned. Warehouse door.<eos> West side.<eos> Get there, you're in the clear.<eos> Go, move. Four more headed your way.<eos> You gotta move, move, move.<eos> Go for the door.<eos> I'll draw their fire.<eos> - We're not separating. - They don't want you. They want me.
Honey, you lit up like Christmas when he walked in the room.<eos> He's terminally unavailable.<eos> And that was before.<eos> - You haven't been watching the news.<eos> It depresses me. My daughter has two men who are both amazing, which just means she has to make a choice.<eos> I want pictures of Queen distributed to every officer, okay?<eos> No, a current one. One with the scruff he's wearing.<eos> Captain Lance I'm here to turn myself in.<eos> Cuff him.<eos> I got you 1O minutes with Oliver, but let's make it five, all right?
Does Mr. Palmer know you guys are in here?<eos> Yes.<eos> He's out of town.<eos> And how did you get in here?<eos> My dad's a super villain and you left your doors unlocked.<eos> Right.<eos> I have been distracted.<eos> 'Cause you and Mr. Diggle are trying to save the city by yourselves?<eos> Look, I've been thinking.<eos> Um, maybe, rather than me sitting at home, alone, miserable, maybe I could... be out there helping you guys.
I am.<eos> It's for you.<eos> What is it?<eos> He's been here.<eos> ... Nice to see you again...<eos> Ms. Queen.<eos> You ok?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She's unhurt.<eos> I have no desire to kill either of you.
I'll go to the one on Broxton.<eos> You go to the one on Fourth.<eos> I need a shower.<eos> I need ten showers.<eos> Thea.<eos> I'm fine. I would be really, really worried if that were true.<eos> What do you want to hear?<eos> And I don't want you to tell anyone about this, especially Laurel.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because she loves you like a sister, and it would hurt the both of you too much.
Uh, did you check the other computers? Whatever line of crap you're thinking about giving me, you just save it.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Smart as you all are, you are bound to make a mistake eventually.<eos> And I'm going to be there when it happens.<eos> You wiped the entire place?<eos> And moved some of your more sensitive trunk items.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> But you didn't wipe Roy's prints.<eos> Oliver, Roy already confessed.<eos> We didn't see any point in losing both of you.
Now we're back to trust Oliver, and while we're at it trust you too?<eos> Yeah. Last time I checked, you tried to make a deal with Ra's to save yourself.<eos> In order for our plan to work, Ra's' trust in Oliver had to be complete.<eos> And after that plane fiasco, it wasn't.<eos> Oliver needed to demonstrate one more time his loyalty to Ra's.<eos> Which I guess brings us back to why aren't we dead?<eos> Oliver was vaccinated against the Alpha/Omega virus five years ago.<eos> An associate was able to draw a version of the vaccine from his blood.<eos> A synthetic skin graft.<eos> Upon our incarceration I was able to vaccinate each one of you cutaneously.
I flew with Ra's and the virus to Starling and I sabotaged the plane.<eos> The plan was to kill Ra's and destroy the virus.<eos> It didn't work. How did you expect to survive the plane crash?<eos> You didn't.<eos> You never expected to have this conversation.<eos> You were planning on dying.<eos> So that was your big plan?<eos> Sacrificing yourself to take out Ra's.<eos> It was the only way.<eos> At least now that it didn't work, I get a chance to tell both of you how sorry I am.
So that was your big plan?<eos> Sacrificing yourself to take out Ra's.<eos> It was the only way.<eos> At least now that it didn't work, I get a chance to tell both of you how sorry I am.<eos> Sorry won't cut it, Oliver.<eos> Not this time.<eos> But we have bigger problems than hurt feelings and broken trust.<eos> Laurel needs to contact her father.<eos> Ray needs to find a way to counteract the virus.<eos> I'm sure Malcolm told you. We don't have a lot of time.
I am truly sorry.<eos> Everything was supposed to work out differently.<eos> Stop!<eos> Or I flip this switch and I blow us all right to hell right now!<eos> You're bluffing!<eos> You die right along with us.<eos> I want to be president for my legacy.<eos> Dying a hero is as good a consolation prize as any.<eos> The Suicide Squad.<eos> Well, you are true to your name if you think that the three of you can just shoot your way in here...
Oh, I have a house guest coming, so it's time for you to go now.<eos> Bon voyage, as they say.<eos> Must've hurt like a motherfucker.<eos> For a second I thought you really were dead.<eos> You have to commit if you want to sell it.<eos> You've got some giant balls taking a hit like that.<eos> The Rumanceks are world-renowned for their testicular girth.<eos> A thousand thankyous for what you did.<eos> Yeah, well, you saved my life.<eos> Anyways, it was great being out with you guys - full moon.
As csi, my work on this case is done.<eos> And as the flash,<eos> I don't think I can focus on snart right now.<eos> - You mind telling me what brought about this change Of heart?<eos> - This man in yellow, the man that killed my mom, Is still out there.<eos> I have to be ready to face him, Which means amping up my speed.<eos> It's a question of priorities.<eos> - Your mom's killer Isn't the only reason you've been doing this.<eos> You told me that if you could use your powers To save someone from a burning building, you would.<eos> - Look, dr. Wells and s.T.A.R. Labs are gonna work with you.
- Oh, um... I found this in my closet.<eos> - I haven't seen this in years.<eos> - Well, the nerd survival kit is still intact.<eos> - Wow. - I thought those might be worth something.<eos> I am so late for work.<eos> I promise I will clean this up when I get back, okay?<eos> - Bye. - Bye, yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You mind telling me what's going on with you and iris?<eos> - Hmm. That's funny, because I have these two things called eyes, And it doesn't look like you two are fine.
- Look, I'm an adult.<eos> I make my own choices, my own mistakes.<eos> And I'm glad you push me to be better.<eos> It's so weird.<eos> There was a time in my life That I would've paid money for your autograph.<eos> And now we're...<eos> - Partners.<eos> - I was gonna say friends.<eos> - In case you doubt it, you push me to be better too.<eos> - Guys, you have to come look at this.
- You're right.<eos> Maybe the way to do this is not by going faster.<eos> - It's going slower. - Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thanks for playing, kid.<eos> I didn't see that coming.<eos> I guess you win this time.<eos> - There won't be a next time.<eos> Thank you, detective.<eos> I'm gonna burn Every last one of you pigs!
- I can't say it enough.<eos> I'll miss you.<eos> - You know you can come around anytime, joe.<eos> Just give us a heads-up.<eos> Or not.<eos> Come around whenever.<eos> You want a key?<eos> I'm gonna go.<eos> I'll wait... In the truck.<eos> - Why don't I give you two a minute?
Oh, you interested in teaching me?<eos> Oka-- okay, stop.<eos> Yeah, I have a gun.<eos> And I'm a good shot, as you well know.<eos> I'm gonna watch the house as much as I can, but if they want to get to you, they're gonna get to you.<eos> You can't be doing this, anyways.<eos> You're sick.<eos> I'm in remission, Phillip.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> There's only one soul between you.
After I got in the truck, they started beating on him, so, you know, it looked like they had intent to kill.<eos> So I grabbed a pistol from the glove box that I'd confiscated earlier and fired several shots out the windshield.<eos> I hit one of them, and they returned fire as I got out, and while using the truck as cover,<eos> I managed to take out the second.<eos> What about the one with the broken neck?<eos> Well, that was an accident.<eos> I was just trying to keep him from shooting the cop.<eos> See, it's like I said-- my dad is a cop killer.<eos> I'm a cop saver.<eos> Can you confirm, for the record, that after the shootout, while you and the prisoner were waiting for help to arrive, there was no discussion whatsoever between the two of you?
All right.<eos> I guess it's been a while.<eos> Okay, this is spicy.<eos> No wimps need apply.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Hey. You want to play?<eos> I don't know how.<eos> Oh, that's all right.<eos> Neither does your husband.<eos> You boys have fun.
He's stuck on the mountain.<eos> Let's go have some fun with this kid.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, we'll take my truck.<eos> Grab the beer.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> All right.<eos> Sorry, Lieutenant.<eos> I-I-I didn't even see those things.<eos> Didn't they teach you how to drive in the academy?
Disenrolled? What the hell does that mean?<eos> Means he kicked you out.<eos> Sorry, but I can't have you work for me anymore.<eos> The only reason I hired you was 'cause I thought I was helping out a fellow Lenape.<eos> God made me Lenape, asshole-- not Mac.<eos> _<eos> Be careful with those fireworks.<eos> They won't be blowing up my boy.<eos> This ain't the first time I've done this.<eos> Remember, when Mac gets back, I want a picture of you and him.
What's going on? [ Sighs ]<eos> Nothing.<eos> Did something happen with mom while I was gone?<eos> Something with grandpa?<eos> No.<eos> Honey, secrets can be a hard thing to carry by yourself.<eos> Take it from your dad.<eos> There are no secrets, dad.<eos> Drop it. Drop it.<eos> Is there any more of you?
Because they're part of this.<eos> I gotta say, you boys really confused the Brinkmans.<eos> Hey. Your sister called us "boys"!<eos> - Oh, dear...<eos> - What?<eos> He wants me to call him my...<eos> I don't want to get involved.<eos> - We're having nomenclature issues. - No, no, no.<eos> What to call each other now that we're out.<eos> - I can't help you with that.
Well, I guess that's better than nothing.<eos> Is that her?<eos> How could you be married to someone for that long and not...?<eos> - Are they talking about you?<eos> - Yes, they are.<eos> - Are you famous?<eos> - Today I think I am.<eos> - Can I have your autograph?<eos> - Go get a Sharpie.<eos> Hi, do any of you bitches have some gum?
When did you start watching "dr.<eos> Phil"?<eos> [ chuckling ] that would be never. But kiki helped me understand That my deepest emotional fulfillment came from work.<eos> I often wonder if I could have balanced a career And a marriage to casey.<eos> That's something you would have had to work on together.<eos> I think kiki would point out That casey's own issues with marriage and career Complicated the relationship.<eos> [ dog barking in distance ] I'm so sorry I hurt you, carol.<eos> I think I'd like your kiki.<eos> Pretty extraordinary woman.<eos> What's the deal between you two?
- The fall didn't kill Dylan Blyer.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Actual cause of death was poisoning.<eos> No needle marks, so it's likely he ingested it.<eos> Any idea what it was?<eos> It's from the phenethylamine family.<eos> But I've never seen this exact combination.<eos> - We'll know soon, though.<eos> - Yes, we will!<eos> Is the phen-ethel merman fairy gonna tell you?
When kind of grades do you think a pirate would make - in medical school?<eos> - Please don't.<eos> High seas.<eos> Why didn't the pirate go to the movie?<eos> - Because it was rated "arrrr!"<eos> - How do I make it stop?<eos> You can't!<eos> I haven't even gotten to the booty jokes yet.<eos> Somehow, I'm gonna make Jack pay for this.<eos> You guys all right?
There are just a few days left to get the law passed, so we need to free those funds now.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> It takes time to make such large sums available...<eos> Just a few days, or it'll all blow up in our faces.<eos> I'm sorry. I really don't know how it can be done.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> Unfortunately, at this very moment, there's something... bigger than me, or you, but don't make me say it.<eos> Your Eminence... you're too intelligent not to consider the consequences of the attitude you're taking.<eos> If the deal backfires... they'll put you at the bottom of the Tiber.<eos> And I'd rather see a better fate for you.
Oh, stop.<eos> It'll be lovely, honey.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Here, put this on.<eos> You look like a country gentleman.<eos> Look at that.<eos> You too, John.<eos> You look like royalty.<eos> You're next, Prince Charming.<eos> And I want a photo of you three when we're done.
Please, don't rub it in.<eos> I was just calling because I was curious if that job offer is still on the table.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Are you ready to sit down with a couple of partners?<eos> Yeah, I'm definitely interested.<eos> Why can't we see him?<eos> Because we've asked you not to, Janey, that's why.<eos> - But he's our uncle. - I don't understand.<eos> What did he do?<eos> We can't explain all that to you right now, all right?
You can't tell us not to see him and not give us a reason.<eos> Yes, we can, Ben.<eos> We're your parents, okay?<eos> What are you guys afraid of?<eos> Yeah, it's not like we're the ones who went out and got drunk with him.<eos> Listen, you two, you haven't done anything wrong, all right?<eos> No kidding we haven't.<eos> You know what?<eos> Cut the attitude.<eos> We're asking you not to see Uncle Danny.
Oh, it-- ls it too soon?<eos> Would it be disrespectful to Robert?<eos> You know, I think that Dad would...<eos> He'd love to be honored in a celebration like that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, your father and I used to sit out here like this at the end of every week.<eos> I remember.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It started when you kids were little, huh'?<eos> We'd get Meggy to sleep, and that would take about three hours... then we'd sit out here and watch you boys swimming and playing till it was pitch-black dark out.
Yeah.<eos> It started when you kids were little, huh'?<eos> We'd get Meggy to sleep, and that would take about three hours... then we'd sit out here and watch you boys swimming and playing till it was pitch-black dark out.<eos> And Sarah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I remember you fighting with her.<eos> BOY-<eos> Yeah, she would've...<eos> She'd have played with you three all night if we'd let her.
An address which, by the way, doesn't exist.<eos> Clay, I thought you were tracking his cell phone.<eos> We were.<eos> Found the fucking thing stuffed in his goddamn glove box.<eos> These assholes must have known we were onto them.<eos> All right.<eos> Shouldn't take us more than a couple of hours to get to the Bahamas.<eos> Nice.<eos> Paulo will meet you two in Nassau.<eos> He'll get you spending money, set you up, make sure you're comfortable.
Yeah.<eos> I'm fine. Okay.<eos> Ugh, I can smell their insecurity from here.<eos> I think it's Eau de Taylor Swift.<eos> I used to beat up girls like this in high school.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, now you're one of them, so big smile!<eos> Hi, ladies!<eos> And gentleman.<eos> As some of you may know, I'm Bo from the Vancity Valkyries and I'm here to recruit one very special cheerleader.
Well, now you're one of them, so big smile!<eos> Hi, ladies!<eos> And gentleman.<eos> As some of you may know, I'm Bo from the Vancity Valkyries and I'm here to recruit one very special cheerleader.<eos> You'll be competing with the top from across the country, so who's ready to show me what you got?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Excuse me, hi.<eos> Miss?<eos> I'm Brinkley White, I'm the captain of the team. And she doesn't go here.<eos> This is Tamsin. Her school doesn't have a cheerleading team, so she's auditioning with you guys.
No, Heraclids are humans, but with exceptional genes.<eos> They're strong, fast, and incredibly resilient.<eos> What would cause that kind of mutation?<eos> Heraclids are descendants of Hercules.<eos> As in Hercules, Hercules?<eos> The one and only.<eos> What does this mean?<eos> I told you I don't know.<eos> The sooner you cooperate with the police, the sooner this will all be over.<eos> How many of you are there?
I think Brinkley stole my lucky hairbrush. Again.<eos> Who's he?<eos> This is Detective Dyson.<eos> He's working on the investigation.<eos> Like a real detective?<eos> I heard you might have some theories about who killed Jake Marshall.<eos> Is there going to be a trial?<eos> Would I have to testify?<eos> If you guys are looking for suspects, I will...<eos> I will show you some suspects.
Still online creep-dating single oracles?<eos> Still pretending to be one?<eos> You took over an entire PR firm to promote one client.<eos> Why? Let's just say that Clay's like family.<eos> He's famous now, his face is going to be on a protein bar.<eos> Peanut Chocolate Fudge.<eos> I picked the flavour.<eos> And the bigger Clay's fan base grows, the better for the family.<eos> Family, huh?<eos> If you care about Clay so much why did you put a bloody jersey in his boyfriend's locker?
I love storms!<eos> Enthusiasm.<eos> Bucket.<eos> Zeus was so frustrated with the human's impiety, that he flooded the Earth to destroy mankind.<eos> He used Hera's messenger Iris, the Rainbow god, to do it.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, let me get something straight.<eos> When you say gods, you actually mean... Fae.<eos> So powerful, that a long time ago, humans worshipped them.<eos> Whoa, hold the lift.<eos> If Zeus and his ancient bunch are wreaking havoc in our colony's skies, why am I stuck here in Cheers with you lot?
The birthday's pretty close.<eos> It's August 1990, then she died in '93, along with her whole family.<eos> But her social went active about six months ago.<eos> But this doesn't say Rebecca Sands.<eos> It says Jane Doe.<eos> State troopers found her body in a ditch, in an abandoned construction site outside of Tucson.<eos> I mean, there's no-- There's no picture.<eos> There's no proof of anything.<eos> "And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.<eos> Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you."
Specialized in cyber security.<eos> Oh, the ultimate white hat.<eos> Bet he had a lot of data worth killing for.<eos> Attorney general again.<eos> So the target murders Cade, steals his government secrets and then wipes his devices clean to remove any trace of the intrusion.<eos> That's a smart move.<eos> Clean up a crime scene with bleach after the kill.<eos> Everything in here should recover the wiped info from the vic's devices, okay?<eos> Just plug it in. I already know all this, Krumitz. This is a big case.<eos> I should be coming with you to Boston.
- Impossible.<eos> That was mere rumour.<eos> Trick hid his secret well.<eos> If Trick was the Blood King, he would have shown his power.<eos> That was not his way.<eos> He could have killed you all.<eos> But instead he chose peace.<eos> To him, the Dal Riata was a place of Sanctuary.<eos> So, as a tribute to the Blood King,<eos> I ask that you join me in creating that peace.
- Hey, don't do that.<eos> - I'm on the phone, Janey.<eos> I'm just asking where.<eos> I've gotta talk to Aunt Meg.<eos> Then I'll pick you up.<eos> We gotta get going now.<eos> Come on.<eos> You know what?<eos> Hang on. I can't pick you up.<eos> - Can one of you two pick up Janey?
Phil's my husband.<eos> Surprise!<eos> You guys don't understand.<eos> This was gonna be an awesome joke.<eos> I just can't believe you didn't tell us there were other people.<eos> Yeah, that's, like, the one thing that's important in this world.<eos> Yeah, and all for what, just so you can get laid? No.<eos> Because I had this awesome idea for a prank.<eos> And I had it perfectly lined up.<eos> I mean, I had you guys thinking that I was going out camping, and I had you guys thinking these guys didn't exist.
So, you know, God, it was gonna be such a great one, a-and then you guys all just ruined it.<eos> I feel so bad for you... You missed out on this wonderful thing.<eos> I mean, see, I was gonna...<eos> I was gonna...<eos> What... what was gonna happen was, when we got out to those hot springs,<eos> I was gonna say, "Hey, wait... I need my bathing suit."<eos> Then I was gonna lead you back to our cul-de-sac, introduce you to all these people who mean the most to me in the world.<eos> 'Cause you do...<eos> Have I ever told you guys that?<eos> I wish I told you more. - Yeah.
What...?<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> This is amazing.<eos> I can't believe you guys have a cow!<eos> And Gail's a chef, so this is, like...<eos> Hon, the things I can make with this. My mind is literally spinning.<eos> Creme brulee, dulce de leche...<eos> Good morning.<eos> I just came here to get some... java... little milk.<eos> These guys give you the tour?
Don't miss beds.<eos> Knock, knock... - Carol?<eos> - Knock, knock.<eos> Did you hear us knocking?<eos> Well, we just wanted to drop by with this pecan pie and say we hope that there's no hard feelings.<eos> Why would there be any hard feelings?<eos> All you did was make a series of quick, slut-based decisions about sharing your body with a man you hardly knew.<eos> Carol, you know we would never have done that stuff if we'd known Phil was married.<eos> Of course.<eos> I don't hold it against you.
- This is...<eos> - I just...<eos> Whoo!<eos> - This is weird.<eos> - Very.<eos> - Carol, what is going on with you?<eos> It's called being just fine, Melissa.<eos> Maybe you should try it some time.<eos> - Carol...<eos> - Now, if you don't mind,
- I have diarrhea...<eos> - Big Shankhead here...<eos> - Cormaneau... - I'm a nice person...<eos> - The name's Mike Miller...<eos> - Balls are clean...<eos> I am a liar.<eos> Look who it is, everybody.<eos> Mike Miller.<eos> Or is it Mike Cormaneau?<eos> Can I talk to you guys?
This guy at work, we kissed today.<eos> In the pantry!<eos> This is boring!<eos> So you kissed somebody!<eos> Everybody kisses things.<eos> White people kiss their dogs.<eos> You lived in a bunker.<eos> Where did you go to the bathroom?<eos> Did anybody try to eat anybody?<eos> Was there ever a moment where you were like,
Go, kid! Go, go!<eos> Set a perimeter!<eos> Hold them back on the right side!<eos> Come on, kids, let's go!<eos> Let's go! Move it! Come on!<eos> Keep moving!<eos> Keep moving!<eos> Tell him to take off!<eos> We're clear!<eos> You kids doing all right?
A home of sorts.<eos> Sadly, there wouldn't be much left of wherever you came from.<eos> But we do have a place for you.<eos> A refuge, outside the Scorch, where WICKED will never find you again.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> Why are you helping us?<eos> Let's just say the world out there is in a rather precarious situation.<eos> We're all hanging on by a very thin thread.<eos> The fact that you kids can survive the Flare virus... makes you the best chance of humanity's continued survival.<eos> Unfortunately, it also makes you a target, as no doubt by now you've noticed.
What happened?<eos> I think you got struck by lightning.<eos> Come on, let's get him up.<eos> Nice and slow.<eos> Let's get him up.<eos> Think you can get up?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> What's that smell?<eos> Behind you!
Good evening!<eos> This is the World Catastrophe Killzone Department.<eos> We have your compound completely surrounded.<eos> You find yourselves, through no fault of your own... in possession of WICKED property.<eos> Barkley.<eos> Return them to us unharmed and we'll consider this a simple misunderstanding.<eos> Hang on, guys.<eos> Or you can resist...<eos> Newt!<eos> ...and every last one of you will die.
Shit!<eos> All right, take me down.<eos> Shit.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There's just nothing you can do for them.<eos> If we don't move now, we won't be much better off.<eos> You guys gotta go right now.<eos> What?<eos> They're not looking for you. You'll be safe, but you have to go now.
Minho!<eos> Come back!<eos> - Thomas, get back!<eos> - No! Thomas, no!<eos> Minho!<eos> Go! Come on!<eos> What do we do now?<eos> Well, we pick up what's left of us.<eos> We stick to the plan.<eos> We get you kids to the safe haven.
Orange juice, Hanna.<eos> Please.<eos> Careful.<eos> Cup's hot.<eos> Nice foam, but if you start at the top and work your way down at the bottom.<eos> I'm pretty sure I can figure it out.<eos> Thanks, though.<eos> I'm in your territory.<eos> I'll just give you your space.<eos> Is everything okay with you two?
~ Stephen Gardiner is...<eos> ~ You're very unwilling today.<eos> You don't like the French?<eos> Perhaps you would prefer an alliance with the Emperor?<eos> You're very friendly with his man, aren't you?<eos> Chapuys?<eos> If that will be all, Your Majesty?<eos> Why don't you ask for her?<eos> The Seymours are poor.<eos> They'll sell her to you happily.
Or would you let them scrap it out?<eos> It's good to have a few kings and queens in reserve if you are going to start a war.<eos> Oh, no need of a war.<eos> God is sending a plague to England.<eos> ~ Henry will be dead in six months and so will his whore.<eos> ~ And me?<eos> And you.<eos> And everyone in this room.<eos> Except you?<eos> And my niece, Alice, who has done you no harm?
And you.<eos> And everyone in this room.<eos> Except you?<eos> And my niece, Alice, who has done you no harm?<eos> All the women of your house are heretics.<eos> The plague will rot them all.<eos> We're too soft with her.<eos> She's laughing at us.<eos> She's close to confessing.<eos> ~ What makes you think that?
Well, where it is a question of conscience, there must be some doubt.<eos> And when you entered the King's service, you took an oath to obey him.<eos> So, won't you set your doubts against that certainty and swear?<eos> When you were appointed archbishop, you swore an oath to Rome.<eos> But they say, all through the ceremony, you kept a little paper folded up, saying you took the oath under protest. Then perhaps you could...?<eos> Yes, you would suggest that, Richard Riche.<eos> I remember you as a youth and you were ever a creature of vice.<eos> But I will not be such a juggler.<eos> I have respected you.<eos> Since I was a boy, I have respected you.
He's writing an account of today for all of Europe to read and in it, we'll be the fools and oppressors, and he'll be the poor victim with the better turn of phrase.<eos> He wrote this play years ago, and he sniggers every time I trip over my lines.<eos> Do you think it's already been decided what the Queen's baby will be?<eos> Or does God decide later?<eos> I wish we could see inside her, so we'd be able to tell.<eos> I wish you were down in Wiltshire.<eos> I'd like a baby.<eos> Watch yourself.<eos> If your belly shows, they'll brick you up alive.<eos> Although, your family would probably give you a bouquet.
I say none harm, I think none harm.<eos> If this isn't enough to keep a man alive...<eos> You do nobody harm?<eos> What about Bilney?<eos> What about Bainham?<eos> You remember James Bainham who you had racked in your own home?<eos> That you had beaten and abused?<eos> His body was so broken they had to carry him, carry him in the chair to Smithfield to be burned!<eos> And you say, Thomas More, you do no-one harm?<eos> You just be grateful, sir, that we have spared you the methods you use on others.

".. words...<eos> ".. just words."<eos> As I have already told you, I have no recollection of meeting you then.
You know they burnt it before I could see if it was a boy.<eos> It may have been impossible to tell, Your Majesty.<eos> So soon.<eos> This, erm... This business of Thomas More.<eos> I don't doubt his loyalty to Rome, or his hatred of Your Majesty's title as Head of the Church.<eos> However, legally, our case is slender.<eos> It won't be easy.<eos> Do I keep you for what's easy?<eos> Do you think I've promoted you for the charm of your presence?<eos> I keep you because you're a serpent.
Do you think I've promoted you for the charm of your presence?<eos> I keep you because you're a serpent.<eos> Do not be a viper in my bosom.<eos> You know my decision.<eos> Execute it.<eos> That woman on the wall.<eos> I know who she is.<eos> Sheba.<eos> For you.<eos> I know who she is for you.
You're going to hang me up by my wrists until I talk?<eos> I think there is another woman in your heart now.<eos> Thomas More's wife is here to see you.<eos> Lady Alice.<eos> When I came here before, this was a musty old place.<eos> My husband used to say, "Put Thomas Cromwell in a dungeon and by evening,<eos> "he'll be sitting on cushions, with gaolers owing him money."<eos> Did he talk a lot about putting me in dungeons? He...<eos> It was only talk.<eos> I thought you might take me to see the King.
And he says I never miss a trick.<eos> If he stands on his silence...<eos> His silence proves nothing.<eos> He doesn't have to prove anything, my lord.<eos> His plea is that his silence is consent enough to the King's desires. Bollocks.<eos> It is the maxim of the common law.<eos> Still bollocks.<eos> He hasn't been entirely silent.<eos> I came to take away your books. And as I did so, I tried to convince you one last time to take the oath.<eos> I put a case to you, did I not?
He denied the King's title.<eos> That would be treason.<eos> Ask yourselves, gentlemen, why would I open my mind to a man like Richard Riche?<eos> Why, when the learned and the pious have implored me, when the King himself with weighty reasons has sought to persuade me.<eos> Because you think I don't matter.<eos> That is what you said.<eos> I will take my oath on it.<eos> Your oath?<eos> Your oath isn't worth the Devil's fart!<eos> Christ help you, Riche, I have known you since you were a child, you were the despair of your family, you were a gambler and a waster.
Where'd you, uh, pick up that accent?<eos> Accent? You racist woman.<eos> I admit, it's a total put-on.<eos> Different roles for different jobs.<eos> I have a lot of friends.<eos> And what is it you do?<eos> Specialty events. I am an organizer.<eos> What kind of events?<eos> All kinds.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, y'all best to get stepping 'fore my man Bodine come in here with a lawyer, chew your asses out.
Uh, he's no longer with us, I'm afraid.<eos> Hello, Ray.<eos> What happened?<eos> Why don't you tell me, Ray?<eos> Hmm? Davis, Woodrugh.<eos> It's all you, right?<eos> You know I know, right?<eos> The robbery in '92.<eos> Caspere kept some diamonds.<eos> He was holding them over you, yeah?
Come, I will show how to play.<eos> Do you like?<eos> Except my hair gone.<eos> - To me and so loving.<eos> You know what?<eos> To me, frankly - too.<eos> - I envy you your dragons!<eos> Jealous ? ! - Yes.<eos> You do what you want.<eos> Fly wherever you want!
This fool who laid hands on my brother?<eos> - Not my concern.<eos> - It should be.<eos> He was asking about your employer, by name.<eos> All the more reason to settle this.<eos> You sneeze, we all catch a cold.<eos> Madame Gao and Mr. Nobu have expressed their disappointment.<eos> We have not heard of this.<eos> Hmm, that's because we've been talking behind your back, about how the Russians can't seem to handle one man running around in a mask.<eos> I mean, if he had an iron suit or a magic hammer, maybe that would explain why you keep getting your asses handed to you...
Ignore him.<eos> Hey, Ben, why don't you come and join us over here?<eos> - Hey, Joe.<eos> - Good to see you out.<eos> Nice to see you again, Christy.<eos> We were just leaving.<eos> Going so soon, Kev?<eos> Christy, Ben, it's so good to see you both.<eos> - Happy holidays.<eos> - You, too.
-Tiger: This one's a treat.<eos> -Sam: What happened to fire code?<eos> -Yeah, sorry guys. We have to make room for the headliner.<eos> -Cowcatcher, right?<eos> -Big Justin: Yes. You gotta clear out, okay?<eos> -Thank you. -Big Justin:<eos> And it's all there.<eos> And you guys follow me, okay?<eos> All right.<eos> I'll get you one more two liter for the road.
We open the door for the police, or we keep the bullets.<eos> Uh, the cartridges.<eos> -Darcy: I've got no problem with that.<eos> -Okay, I handed them the gun.<eos> I'm gonna head out now.<eos> -No, you're not.<eos> -Hang on.<eos> -No, he gave us the gun, he gave us the gun-- -big Justin:<eos> Nobody is... Letting me do anything.<eos> I gave you the goddamn gun, okay?
-Darcy: Good.<eos> And can we please elect just one voice?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Darcy:<eos> Okay. Now, you're trapped.<eos> That's not a threat.<eos> It's a fact. -Well, we have a loaded gun.<eos> That's also just a fact.<eos> -Darcy: Oh, we have plenty more guns on hand.<eos> We just want you out.
You don't know him like I do.<eos> Sometimes I even forget he can't see, the way he zips around.<eos> So you're not worried?<eos> I'm gonna go look for him.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> The hell you are.<eos> Lay back.<eos> I'm the closest he has to family.<eos> He'd do the same for me.<eos> I know... and I love that about you guys, but don't be an idiot.
Yeah, like she's looking into Tom's murder.<eos> Have a good night. She'll leave when he gets locked up.<eos> I just feel for those poor kids.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Don't. It's not worth it.<eos> This is ju...<eos> My life.<eos> Your life sucks.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Are you guys okay?
Yeah.<eos> And you'll keep them safe?<eos> I will.<eos> Then search away. I won't be here.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - Dave's.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah, they'll search the house and find any other cameras or anything this guy's using to stalk me.<eos> So, why can't you stay?<eos> You guys will have the detail. You'll be safe.
I'm not gonna let cops follow me around.<eos> - Why? What are you gonna be doing?<eos> - Why are they here again? Sorry.<eos> I tried to keep her upstairs.<eos> I'm not a baby.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Honey, the police are here to keep us safe. That's all.<eos> From who?<eos> Listen, monkey. Someone is mad at dad and doing some crazy stuff.<eos> I'm afraid that if he comes after me and I'm with you guys, you would get hurt, and that can't happen.
- I'm sorry. But I don't want to live my whole life in Bear Creek, South Dakota.<eos> It's 1992. And nothing has changed in this country.<eos> If you want to get anywhere, you need to be blonde and white.<eos> But you're an Indian, Jackie Lynn.<eos> God, Dad, saying "Indian" is offensive now.<eos> Then what do you call sitting on the floor with your legs crossed?<eos> Crisscross applesauce.<eos> - We invented sitting like that.<eos> - Oh, that's insane.<eos> I know you don't approve of what I'm doing, but you'll change your tune when I'm married to 1992's sexiest man alive, Nick Nolte.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Sorry you had to cover for me.<eos> It was not worth it.<eos> My date tried to kill me with a pine cone.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, sure. We've all been there.<eos> Uh, Buckley's lacrosse was actually fun.<eos> He kept getting nailed by the ball.<eos> And I know it's wrong, but, oh, man, it was so satisfying.<eos> So... um... maybe tomorrow I'll go with you, you know, just keep you company.
He's gone.<eos> He'll be back, that's for sure.<eos> We have to think of what to say.<eos> Why won't you let me in? I just wanted to speak to Sarah.<eos> Hey, get a hold of yourself.<eos> I just want to talk, ck?<eos> Get out of here! Go, I said!<eos> Get out of here I said!<eos> Get your hands off of me!<eos> What's wrong with you?
Like anyone, you know how that is.<eos> Not like anyone!<eos> You almost broke my nose.<eos> I have to speak with Sarah!<eos> She knows me.<eos> Please!<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> - Please!<eos> I just wanna talk!<eos> What did I ever do to you?
Not like anyone!<eos> You almost broke my nose.<eos> I have to speak with Sarah!<eos> She knows me.<eos> Please!<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> - Please!<eos> I just wanna talk!<eos> What did I ever do to you?<eos> What did I do to you?
- Morning.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I thought you had a gig.<eos> It was cancelled.<eos> I had to speak to mum for a sec.<eos> 0k...<eos> Are you upset?<eos> About yesterday?<eos> No.<eos> I have to tell you something.
It's about Charlie.<eos> - Sarah...!<eos> Her father was here yesterday.<eos> He was at the door, just a wreck.<eos> I didn't open the door. He was so drunk.<eos> I didn't kill Charlie.<eos> She's still alive, really.<eos> You can call her. Sarah, we know it's hard for you.<eos> - No, really, I'm not crazy!<eos> We wanted to get back at you.
I didn't kill Charlie.<eos> She's still alive, really.<eos> You can call her. Sarah, we know it's hard for you.<eos> - No, really, I'm not crazy!<eos> We wanted to get back at you.<eos> Because you left me alone.<eos> On my birthday, and then the camp thing.<eos> You only think of yourselves.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I wanted to tell you earlier...
Will it heal?<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Find me something to cover it.<eos> Close the palace gates. Admit no one to the King's presence without my permission.<eos> Especially not the Queen.<eos> Rochefort attacked the Queen.<eos> He tried to force himself on her.<eos> She fought him off. Wounded him.<eos> He dared to lay hands on you.
Especially not the Queen.<eos> Rochefort attacked the Queen.<eos> He tried to force himself on her.<eos> She fought him off. Wounded him.<eos> He dared to lay hands on you.<eos> I trusted him.<eos> Thought he was my friend.<eos> The King has been informed?<eos> My loyal Musketeers will escort me.<eos> Rochefort knows everything about you and the Queen.
But it no longer matters.<eos> I have everything I need.<eos> Some new fashion I missed.<eos> Not sure it'll catch on in the salons of Paris.<eos> You think me a suitable target for your humour? Hmm?<eos> I am ridiculous to you?<eos> Beg. Beg for my forgiveness.<eos> Beg!<eos> Beg for your life.<eos> I beg you.
Well, what else would you expect from a woman like me?<eos> You disgust me.<eos> Meanwhile, the King is bouncing another man's child on his knee.<eos> Your morality will not stand, Musketeer.<eos> How do we know you won't betray us?<eos> You don't.<eos> Rochefort is a Spanish agent.<eos> He has been in the pay of Madrid's spymaster, Vargas, ever since his return.<eos> Dear God.<eos> I never meant to keep any secrets from you, but you must understand why I had to.
What are you doing?<eos> You have no future without me now.<eos> Everything I do, you are part of.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Why would the Spanish attack a Spanish Queen? What do they gain?<eos> Ambassador Perales never believed in Vargas's scheme.<eos> That's why Rochefort ordered his death.<eos> How can you know that?<eos> Because it was me who killed him.<eos> You know, the Captain lost his position because of you.
What is it?<eos> Why is she staring?<eos> It's very unnerving.<eos> What is she doing here?<eos> - She offered to help.<eos> - You don't need help.<eos> Take the Dauphin away, the King needs rest.<eos> Perhaps this governess is right.<eos> The child should be with his mother.<eos> The Dauphin must stay with you, Sire.
In time, I must return to confront my enemies.<eos> But you can escape, Aramis.<eos> Live a different life, far away from danger.<eos> I've never fled from danger in my life.<eos> Won't you save yourself for my sake?<eos> For the sake of my son?<eos> Our son.<eos> How could I live with myself if I abandoned my duty?<eos> My only concern is for your safety.<eos> I swear I will not allow anything to happen to you... because of me.
For the sake of my son?<eos> Our son.<eos> How could I live with myself if I abandoned my duty?<eos> My only concern is for your safety.<eos> I swear I will not allow anything to happen to you... because of me.<eos> Whatever happens, I will never regret what happened here.<eos> We have found those responsible, Your Majesty, at the heart of the Queen's household.<eos> This is absurd.<eos> These two were the means of executing the plot. He's lying, Sire.<eos> The Queen would never hurt you.
Constance and Lemay are intimate.<eos> The Doctor would do anything she asked.<eos> The Queen met with him in secret.<eos> Marguerite.<eos> Marguerite, what are you saying?<eos> I cannot look at them.<eos> Do what you must, only you let me rest.<eos> I am loyal.<eos> Sire, please, I beg you!<eos> I beg you!
I loved Aramis.<eos> And he didn't love you, did he?<eos> You wanted revenge. Now, you have it.<eos> Doesn't it taste sweet?<eos> What have I become?<eos> - What have you done to me?<eos> - We are not done yet.<eos> Sister, I could kiss you.<eos> Best not, perhaps.<eos> Your Majesty, I will beg you one more time. At least stay until we have Vargas.
It is impossible.<eos> I know the danger, Captain, but I must go.<eos> Godspeed, Porthos.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> D'Artagnan.<eos> Constance is a brave girl.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Look after yourself.<eos> I always do.<eos> It's you that I worry about.
No. I just thought...<eos> They're here.<eos> Hurry. Down you go.<eos> I want to stay with you!<eos> Do as I say.<eos> Now, Savva!<eos> All alone then, sweetie?<eos> Yes, I'm alone.<eos> Everyone is to gather in the square. Now!<eos> After we're done feeding on your harvest, we're taking you to Mom!
Why don't you just agree to go your separate ways?<eos> He is a mosquito!<eos> I am a semi-baron!<eos> It would be beneath my dignity to even speak to him, let alone agree on anything.<eos> He is below my station.<eos> And below our nostrils.<eos> I am traveling to see the Magician - who lives on the mountain. - Savva, don't...<eos> Hey, we're going to see the Magician too!<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Then I will allow you to travel by my side as long as you stay two steps behind me.
Because we stuck around the woods, see, to drop some eaves.<eos> We heard them say they're all on their way to see the Magician.<eos> What'd I miss?<eos> Torpedoes!<eos> I need you to do what you do best.<eos> No! I don't mean chasing girls.<eos> Tell us what to do, Mom.<eos> I need you to spy.<eos> I want you to know every move the invaders make. Every step they take. Is that clear?<eos> Because after we're done feeding on your harvest, we're taking you to Mom.
My popchock found something.<eos> What is she talking about?<eos> My skull bowl has audio.<eos> It's stop.<eos> Well, the visuals were great, but there was not much of a plot.<eos> I read lips.<eos> She was talking about y'all.<eos> What about us?<eos> She said she never going to let you through to see the Magic Man.<eos> She'll use her whole army to keep you out.
I don't want to change back.<eos> Then I will take the boy and go.<eos> You may end up alone.<eos> I am always alone.<eos> Come with me if you want to live.<eos> That's a pretty corny line.<eos> Savva, get up now.<eos> Is it really you?<eos> I'll explain later.<eos> And so it is my duty to inform you that because of your warrantless actions to help the human boy get to the Magician,
Terrified, really.<eos> - It's the truth.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> They ran from him.<eos> How did you escape?<eos> - Anggee got me out.<eos> - It don't add up, pal.<eos> If he's a Rickie, why would he save you from his own outfit?<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> Gather around, and I'll tell you.
What about the heart?<eos> No, the heart is not eternal.<eos> But doesn't God have a heart?<eos> Yes. Of course He does.<eos> His heart is eternal as God himself.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Show yourself.<eos> Grandpa!<eos> You got my message!<eos> Well, we will help you, darling.
Show yourself.<eos> Grandpa!<eos> You got my message!<eos> Well, we will help you, darling.<eos> Thank you for coming, but we are still vastly outnumbered.<eos> Angacetus.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I have a message from your father.<eos> Rickies will fight on your side.<eos> We will give you support.
She has a real gift and we both know it.<eos> You can't mess around with that stuff.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Well, then, who else do we ask?<eos> She saved Ali when Mrs. D. planted her.<eos> She knows all of us, and she seems to like us in some disturbing, creepy sort of way.<eos> It is not like Lo-Jack.<eos> Okay?<eos> You cannot just call her up and ask where's the body.<eos> And even if she could tell you, how are you going to explain to Mrs. Vanderwaal where you got the information, or the police?
Okay.<eos> So the police have already searched, so we have to think of places that they might have missed, or places that the hair could have moved since then.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bingo.<eos> You guys tell Mona's mom that she's got cameras in her molding.<eos> Why does it have to be me?<eos> Because she likes you.<eos> If you suggest the police should take another look, she'll listen.<eos> Just tell her that Mona said something about cameras, and how she was scared.<eos> What makes you sure it was Mona's camera?
Fine words.<eos> Thanks for helping.<eos> Do not scare easily. He was a strong man.<eos> - It was not so dangerous.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> He was mad. Was it a bet?<eos> No.<eos> We played the ass, but we like to be touched.<eos> Next time we'll let the police.<eos> Why are you doing this?
-What does it mean?<eos> -It's A small meadow, pasture.<eos> -The job recruiting office warned me, but I was expecting you later.<eos> I have not opened the lodge, nor removed the bars, but that's it.<eos> Me, Youssouf. Youssouf.<eos> -Dheepan.<eos> -I called the electricity services, the meters will be restored.<eos> It's here !<eos> Fati!<eos> I'll show you the rest.
So we'll put her in UP2A, a transition class.<eos> You understand ?<eos> This is a special class, OK?<eos> You have more questions ?<eos> -They ask many questions.<eos> Who burnt the school, why, how?<eos> -Everyone burns the schools.<eos> -Why do you say that ?<eos> -I do not want !<eos> I want to stay with you !

B. Bouchnak. You see?<eos> Bencherif.<eos> Cortino.<eos> -If You do not know, why are you telling me to do it?<eos> - Let them talk.<eos> - Do you understand them?<eos> Who do you think I am?<eos> -Shut up !<eos> -No need to argue.<eos> We'll show you.
Uh ... India, here ...<eos> Sri Lanka. La.<eos> -It's A bit like India. -No, No.<eos> Below India.<eos> -forget it.<eos> You want ?<eos> -Non.<eos> -Anyhow, your husband, he does his job well. It's good.<eos> -(Thank you...)<eos> - If I can help you ...
What are you doing, sweetie?<eos> [ Sighs ] Looking for a vent.<eos> You'll be looking for a long time.<eos> Are you playing a joke on me?<eos> I thought you said it didn't start until after you were pregnant with Rachel.<eos> What?<eos> The voices.<eos> Mom, you don't have to whisper. She knows.<eos> You know she knows.<eos> The house must have been different then because I know we could hear you.
May I offer you some advice, sir?<eos> Sign the bill.<eos> If you don't, and the storm hits, you and I won't have a campaign.<eos> You should get back to your dinner.<eos> Hey, everyone.<eos> Let's put down the dishes for a second.<eos> Here's the deal.<eos> I hired you three under America Works.<eos> And as much as we can use the manpower, I can't afford it if the program gets ended.<eos> I might be able to afford to keep two of you if you split shifts, but I can't keep all three.
Salazar is a self-righteous prick, but he's not wrong.<eos> You should probably tell everyone the truth. - Sam.<eos> South Pasadena Precinct. - South Pasadena?<eos> All right. Well, thank you.<eos> Look, I know these calls are off-book, but I heard you talking to Shafe about a Louise Mitchell, and, uh, what's her son's name?<eos> Greg.<eos> Gregory Mitchell?<eos> Yeah, you know, I could help you run them down.<eos> I have plenty of time. You know, I... I need to do it myself.<eos> But thank you.
I've made my choice.<eos> You'll die for this.<eos> Not by your hand.<eos> Come on, Athos!<eos> Vargas.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where is Rochefort?<eos> He didn't send you the letter.<eos> I did.<eos> - You? - Mmm.
We leave to help Porthos as soon as night falls.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Rochefort murdered Lemay in front of my eyes.<eos> He's my enemy as much as anybody's.<eos> Very well.<eos> When the time comes, Rochefort's mine.<eos> I want to see my son.<eos> We are taking care of him, Majesty.<eos> What riches has Rochefort promised you?
Her own husband.<eos> Father of her child.<eos> It is unthinkable.<eos> I know this is painful, but...<eos> You do not know, Rochefort!<eos> You do not know. You cannot know.<eos> We must face the truth however terrible.<eos> The Queen is guilty.<eos> I beg Your Majesty to listen to me.<eos> I would never harm you.
If you come down, we will make it quick.<eos> You have my word.<eos> All right then! Let's make it quick!<eos> We are here to establish the facts of the Queen's infidelity.<eos> You are accused of seducing the Queen at the convent in Bourbon-les-Eaux.<eos> And of fathering her child.<eos> Do you swear to give us the truth of this sordid encounter?<eos> I do.<eos> To lie after swearing such a sacred oath is to damn your immortal soul for eternity.<eos> Do you understand?
How would you describe their behaviour?<eos> Look at me, not him.<eos> They were intimate like lovers.<eos> But you yourself were also the Musketeer's lover?<eos> We must hear you.<eos> I was.<eos> Did that affair begin when you first came to court?<eos> Soon after.<eos> When I was appointed Royal Governess to the Dauphin.<eos> His romantic interest in you only coincided with your appointment.
Perhaps I bring men to fight mine.<eos> You are a poor interrogator.<eos> Mere pain is nothing.<eos> I will never betray my country.<eos> You already have.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Does King Philip want to see his own sister murdered?<eos> Rochefort intends to kill her, she may only be hours away from her execution.<eos> The King loves his sister.<eos> If she dies, he'll want revenge, and he'll come to you first.
You need a friend.<eos> I have many friends.<eos> And they will come for me, as they did for Constance.<eos> Oh, they will not come.<eos> There is only you and I now.<eos> In Spain, there was a man who led my torture.<eos> Every day, Vargas and I would cross new thresholds of torment together.<eos> Do you know why it took so long for him to break me?<eos> You.<eos> The mere thought of you was a refuge for my agony.
It's the end, Your Majesty, but not for you.<eos> If you want to see Madrid again, start talking.<eos> You will never touch me again, Rochefort.<eos> Get away from her.<eos> She belongs to me.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> Get back!<eos> You think you can save her?<eos> Why should the Queen be any different to the Cardinal's mistress?<eos> Or Lady Marguerite? She took her own life because of you.
Or Lady Marguerite? She took her own life because of you.<eos> It is finished.<eos> The French King knows everything.<eos> You have betrayed me.<eos> You left me no choice.<eos> Surrender.<eos> Liars.<eos> Yours are the lies, Rochefort.<eos> And they will join you in your grave.<eos> Spain thanks you for your service.
It is as if I have woken from a nightmare.<eos> He deceived many wise men, Your Majesty.<eos> But you were the last.<eos> He's grown stronger since we last held each other.<eos> And so have we.<eos> You are a good and loyal wife.<eos> Oh... Look at him.<eos> Of course he's my son.<eos> I'd need a mirror to find a better likeness.<eos> And you have been grievously wronged, Aramis.
And to your friends.<eos> Come, my dear.<eos> Spain has overreached herself. It is complicity.<eos> Summon the council.<eos> You will attend as my new Minister for War.<eos> Minister for War.<eos> It's time to take your rightful place at the King's side, Captain.<eos> You will not refuse me a second time.<eos> It will be my honour, Majesty.<eos> I need to tell you all something.
I now pronounce you man and wife.<eos> In the name of God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.<eos> War has been declared on Spain.<eos> All leave has been cancelled.<eos> I'll report to the garrison later.<eos> You'll report there now.<eos> - See to your men. - My men?<eos> As Minister for War, I'm making you Captain of the Musketeers.<eos> - Me? - Mmm. I'm not fit to lead anyone.<eos> The men look up to you.
I'm listening to you right now.<eos> What I'm telling you, if you let that bomb you linked to the Web site go off, nobody is going to care what you have to say.<eos> Tell me where the bomb is, and we could... Too late!<eos> It's not too late.<eos> It is too late!<eos> Miles!<eos> Put down the detonator!<eos> You shouldn't have come here.<eos> Miles, stay with me, all right?<eos> Now I have to take you all with me. No. Miles...
The target was counting on that.<eos> He wants that explosion posted.<eos> That's how he spreads his message.<eos> Where's the one place you can guarantee all the cameras will be pointed? The stage.<eos> Start looking for the bomb there.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Yo, cut the music, cut it. Get these people out of here.<eos> Hands away, back up.<eos> Hey, guys, they're telling us we've gotta clear out of here.<eos> I don't know what to tell you, but they've got a badge and they look important. Krumitz.
Someone's figured out how to set a fire through the Internet.<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> At an office supply store.<eos> Do you want to play games?<eos> The code, Rusty.<eos> The code in the flash drive-- who gave it to you?<eos> What makes you think I didn't write it?<eos> You're not that smart.<eos> You're a step above script kiddie.<eos> Hey, I was, uh, gonna try and help you guys out, but if you're gonna insult my skills...
That's right, man, I been working.<eos> Work?<eos> What's that?<eos> Work?<eos> I don't know, man, what's work?<eos> What's work?<eos> Something both of you guys need: jobs.<eos> You see what I'm saying?<eos> Y'all clowning on me already.<eos> All right, see what happens when one of you guys get busted.
Loyalty, it's job one.<eos> Come on, pick up, pick up...<eos> - Babineaux.<eos> - You're there.<eos> Sorry about all the calls.<eos> I've been going crazy worrying about you and Ray.<eos> I've washed every piece of laundry in my building.<eos> You can relax.<eos> The cavalry arrived in time.<eos> You're both okay?
- Well, that was a long time ago.<eos> - Times change.<eos> I mean, here I am.<eos> There you are.<eos> And here these are.<eos> What the fuck? !<eos> Yeah, looks like your agent doesn't recognize your dead friend. Okay.<eos> See, when my client tells me some cops are harassing her on the street...<eos> We're just trying to figure out what happened?<eos> ...and then, sans Counsel, you make her show you some fucking after hours club...
The fountain?<eos> I know where it is.<eos> You keep a monkey as a pet despite disease!<eos> Hey, you two, that ain't the Friends fountain.<eos> - It's not?<eos> - I'm Richard Pennsylvania from Epcot.<eos> People think it is, but the real one is in a studio lot in Burbank.<eos> It looks totally different.<eos> Are we in trouble, Coppicer?<eos> Nah, I'll give you two lovebirds a break.
So... study buddies?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> I forgot you don't touch.<eos> They keep coming.<eos> Excuse me. Hey, I'm looking for Kimmy.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Oh, welcome.<eos> Hey, I love your hat, all the way around and everything, it's...<eos> Kimberly, wow, you look simply divine.<eos> I could listen to you English guys talk all day.
I'm gonna take you home.<eos> - You can't do this. - I'm not doing anything.<eos> - He'll kill her.<eos> Unless you stop it.<eos> You believe that purity of blood is all that matters, and so you call me an Impuro?<eos> It's not supposed to be.<eos> You can't stop life from being messy, so get over it.<eos> I love my wife and I always will.<eos> That's what real purity is.<eos> And I feel sorry for you, because it is something that none of you will ever know.
You can't stop life from being messy, so get over it.<eos> I love my wife and I always will.<eos> That's what real purity is.<eos> And I feel sorry for you, because it is something that none of you will ever know.<eos> We will now take the vote.<eos> The removal of the mask is a sentence of guilt.<eos> It is unanimous.<eos> The defendant is guilty-as-charged, and by Wesenrein law, you will now be put to death.<eos> - Take him!<eos> - I will see you all in hell! No!
Rosalee.<eos> The Tribunal is over.<eos> Nick, thank God you...<eos> Oh, I don't know him either.<eos> So you're Burkhardt?<eos> You got it back.<eos> That is the rumor.<eos> You may be a Grimm again, but you're not gonna be able to arrest all of us.<eos> You're right.<eos> Some of you will be stupid.
The last I saw, he was chasing after Riken.<eos> You should have killed me when you had the chance.<eos> I'm gonna kill you now.<eos> Like hell you are.<eos> We've got to find Monroe and Rosalee.<eos> There!<eos> Did anybody get away?<eos> Because Riken sure didn't.<eos> No.<eos> Thanks to all of you.
We're not taking any chances this time.<eos> How many units you think we'll need?<eos> At least two.<eos> One in the back, one in the front.<eos> And we'll be inside?<eos> And we're going all the way with this one.<eos> And don't let 'em out of our sight until...<eos> Hey, come on, you guys, you're part of this toast too. Oof.<eos> That's gonna leave a mark.<eos> Monroe and I just wanted to thank all of you for what you did. We wouldn't be here without you. I certainly wouldn't.
I wouldn't be here either, so there's a lot of thanks from me too.<eos> Yeah, you should've seen Bud out there. He was awesome.<eos> You really stood up to those sons-of...<eos> Monroe.<eos> Right.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Look, I just wanted to say from the bottom of my heart how much I appreciate, you know, the...<eos> Aww, honey, it's okay.<eos> We just... We're overwhelmed you all were willing to risk your own lives for ours, and we couldn't ask for better friends.<eos> And we can't possibly thank you enough.
Medea?<eos> Medea?<eos> Medea?<eos> Father?<eos> Hero!<eos> Aegeus?<eos> Dearest heart...<eos> Why did you leave me?<eos> He cries for you every night... and wonders where you are every day.<eos> I am coming for you, my sweet boys.
Medea?<eos> Father?<eos> Hero!<eos> Aegeus?<eos> Dearest heart...<eos> Why did you leave me?<eos> He cries for you every night... and wonders where you are every day.<eos> I am coming for you, my sweet boys.<eos> Why?<eos> I love you both more than anything in this world.
He cries for you every night... and wonders where you are every day.<eos> I am coming for you, my sweet boys.<eos> Why?<eos> I love you both more than anything in this world.<eos> Strange way to show it.<eos> [choking up] It was a moment of insanity, one I have regretted ever since.<eos> But I will find a way to make it up to you.<eos> I am closer now than ever before to unlocking the doors to Olympus.<eos> Then I will undo this terrible crime...<eos> And return the short lives I took from you.
...For just a moment or two before I go back.<eos> Come.<eos> Deserting?<eos> Turned a tail in terror, Majesty.<eos> When some of the men disappeared in the fog, a wave of panic spread through the camp.<eos> Most have fled north, over the far side of the mountain.<eos> Where are my generals?<eos> I'll find them myself. [Kre-Kre]:<eos> Forgive me, Majesty.<eos> You know how much I love you, how much I've devoted my entire life to your service, so please believe me when I tell you you must not walk amongst your men.
Then Clay Parker, according to this data log, who was still locked in his cell, somehow vanishes.<eos> Not completely.<eos> What's that? It's some kind of organic particulate residual.<eos> I found it on the floor in here, just outside the cell, out in the hallway.<eos> Trail led me all the way outside.<eos> Dad.<eos> So...<eos> Word around here is, Parker pulled a Shawshank?<eos> Yep, and none of the other prisoners heard or saw anything.<eos> Well, they wouldn't talk to you about it.
Run her DNA against the CCPD criminal database.<eos> See if you get a match.<eos> Yahtzee.<eos> Her name's Shawna Baez.<eos> Mostly petty crimes, and this girl likes to party, apparently.<eos> Long list of disorderly conducts at local bars.<eos> So I'm guessing we find her, we find Clay Parker.<eos> - Barry?<eos> - Yeah. In the meantime, let's track these particulates and see how they work.<eos> I'll be right with you guys.
Hi.<eos> So loud.<eos> I just wanted to make sure you're okay.<eos> Let's just say I envy your inability to get drunk.<eos> I don't remember much from last night.<eos> Yeah, that's probably for the best.<eos> ♪ Summer lovin' ♪ Oh, God.<eos> That I do remember.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Cisco... has something he needs to tell you.
In case we get lost at sea? Let's go.<eos> Cat get stuck up in a tree?<eos> Should've killed me while you had a chance, Junior.<eos> Jim, you've got to let us go. Oh, yeah?<eos> Why's that?<eos> You got a hair appointment?<eos> Them roots are looking a little tired.<eos> Will you just let us go?<eos> If you were gonna kill us, you would've done it already.<eos> Kill you?
You're wrong.<eos> He's alive.<eos> Cut him loose.<eos> Go on.<eos> You're gonna end up dead as the rest of 'em.<eos> This is my town now.<eos> What's left of it.<eos> And that's the last bit of charity you're gonna get.<eos> If by some miracle you make it out alive, you best stay well clear of me.<eos> 'Cause if I see either of you two again, I won't be so merciful next time.
Of friends.<eos> Of family.<eos> After a shared tragedy, there's nothing that provides more consolation than a sense of community.<eos> Those lives will never be forgotten, and their memory will be preserved in an eternal flame here at the monument.<eos> A memorial is about moving forward, moving on, together.<eos> To that effect, I'd like to read a brief epigraph from someone who couldn't be here today.<eos> "Make a way in the wilderness, "and do not remember the former things "or consider the things of old.<eos> "For when you walk through fire, "you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not consume you."<eos> Is there anyone who would care to speak first?<eos> Uh, I wasn't planning on saying anything today, but a lot of you knew my sister, Angie McAlister.
Yeah, yeah, I'd love to see her.<eos> You know, minus the crap tequila.<eos> Well, I'm not sure how long we'll be here in town.<eos> No worries.<eos> I know it must be rough for you being back here.<eos> I think about Julia all the time. Yeah, me, too.<eos> Just glad you were able to move on.<eos> If anyone deserves happiness, it's you.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna let you two catch up.
He has Rebecca at Griffin's fraternity a little after midnight, right? Mm-hmm.<eos> Get the hell out of here!<eos> Griffin?<eos> I got your text.<eos> Lila.<eos> You still think he's worth it?<eos> You stupid slut!<eos> - How could you do this?<eos> ! - Get off!<eos> I never want to see either of you again!
! I looked for Lila all night.<eos> I called her friends.<eos> I went to her room.<eos> I was probably there when she was getting strangled on that roof.<eos> Griffin called Lila 28 times that night.<eos> It's on the phone records.<eos> But you didn't call her once.<eos> 'Cause you already knew she was dead, right?<eos> Or I'd just had sex with her boyfriend, and I knew she didn't want to talk to me.<eos> How's it going with you two?
We pin Sam's murder on Rebecca.<eos> We know that seems hard, especially since we already did the same thing with Nate, but it makes sense.<eos> Sam killed Lila, so Rebecca killed Sam.<eos> And then those of us that actually killed Sam, we testify that Rebecca was the one that did it.<eos> You just have to convince Waitlist.<eos> We thought we can get the surveillance tape from the store where Nate first approached Rebecca.<eos> That way, we can establish that she came to the house - with the thumb drive and she put...<eos> - Stop.<eos> We can't go changing stories with the police, telling a different version every time we feel like it.<eos> - Told you. - But...
But, every once in a while, he could be a dick.<eos> - Let's just say that Hartley, like many outliers, had trouble relating to his peers.<eos> - Yes, but he was always your favorite.<eos> - The chosen one.<eos> He referred to himself like that.<eos> - So if you two were so close, why would he target you?<eos> - Hartley left S.T.A.R. Labs about a year ago after we had a... a disagreement.<eos> - About what?<eos> We'll stop him.<eos> I won't let him hurt you...
But one day, this man will turn on you... in a flash... and even you won't see it coming.<eos> I only hope that he leaves you in better shape than he left me.<eos> If you're lucky, you'll only be dead.<eos> Because every day I have to live with the agonizing, piercing screaming in my ears.<eos> I almost forgot...<eos> I told your pet I know your deep, dark secret, Harrison.<eos> Have fun letting him in on that one.<eos> - I assume you were all listening.<eos> Well, Hartley was telling the truth.<eos> I have not been honest with you.

Your presence will be required later at the Council meeting.<eos> Chancellor Dupre is making a special trip to be here.<eos> I can look after Princess Louise but you really should greet your Chancellor personally.<eos> Oh, very well.<eos> But in the meantime, I am going to bed. I am very tired.<eos> It's not a coincidence, is it? This killing, the men who attacked us on the journey?<eos> It's me they're after, isn't it? Speculation is pointless.<eos> There's no need to worry.<eos> If I am to die, I would rather be prepared.<eos> No harm will come to you now.
Then why do you force me to reveal to the world the sordid details of your private life?<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> It would ruin me.<eos> You leave me no choice.<eos> You ask too much of me.<eos> I asked for information on the Queen and you failed to provide it.<eos> So, I must assume, you wish me to speak to your father.<eos> The shame will kill him.<eos> Please!<eos> I will give you one last chance.
How wonderful to be in love.<eos> I wish I were.<eos> What about your husband to be? Is he a good man?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> We meet for the first time when I get to Sweden.<eos> France's political alliances are more important than my personal happiness.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> It would be nice to love as one chooses.<eos> Constance is a lucky woman.<eos> I envy her finding a man Like you.
Rochefort treats me like his errand boy now.<eos> I'm to fetch the Queen's gift for Princess Louise.<eos> Don't let him humiliate you.<eos> Do you think I should refuse the job?<eos> Deliver this gift directly to the Queen herself.<eos> Let her see your devotion and loyalty, even in the face of provocation.<eos> It's you that should have been a politician.<eos> I never had any talent for such games.<eos> The regiment will need a new captain soon.<eos> I could recommend you.
It's you that should have been a politician.<eos> I never had any talent for such games.<eos> The regiment will need a new captain soon.<eos> I could recommend you.<eos> I'm finished here.<eos> It's time you all accepted that.<eos> Monsieur Boucher, I am Athos.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> I make it my business to know the finest swordsmen in France.<eos> So, what can I do for you?
Or the killer was a member of the Red Guard.<eos> I have more than 500 guards under my command, unless you've killed any in a bar room brawl today.<eos> Do you think you could be a little more precise in your accusations?<eos> It doesn't concern you that there is a traitor amongst your own men?<eos> It would concern me more if you had any proof.<eos> This weapon could have found its way into anyone's hands.<eos> You Musketeers, you really must give up this ugly habit of blaming your failures on everyone else.<eos> Milady de Winter, a moment.<eos> Search her bag.<eos> What do you think you're doing?
Do you think it might be the same person who killed the Archbishop?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It could be nothing more than a coincidence.<eos> You should go to him.<eos> I won't leave you unprotected. Not for a moment.<eos> You any closer to finding the Arch bishop's killer?<eos> We believe there to be a connection to the Red Guard. He might even be inside the palace itself.<eos> Dear God, someone close to the King is a traitor.<eos> It's possible.<eos> No harm will come to you.
You think there is a connection between her and Aramis?<eos> What do you know of that?<eos> Nothing for certain.<eos> Only the way he looks at her.<eos> The way he should have looked at me but never did.<eos> I've said too much.<eos> I'm sorry, it's just my foolish jealousy.<eos> Watch them.<eos> Watch them every second and tell me what you discover.<eos> I beg you, please, leave me be now.
And why did they try to kill her this morning?<eos> The Archbishop was always the target.<eos> And the fake Louise must have been in on the plan.<eos> But why assassinate a man of God?<eos> The Archbishop wasn't just a priest. He was also a senior member of the King's Council.<eos> So is Chancellor Dupre.<eos> He's on his way to the Louvre for the Council meeting.<eos> He thinks he's safe there.<eos> My congratulations.<eos> I had to stop myself laughing out loud, the way you had the Musketeers fawning all over you.
All of them.<eos> Oh, D'Artagnan, if I knew we'd met under different circumstances.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm afraid the real Princess Louise never even made it out of Lombardy.<eos> You mean you killed her?<eos> But on the positive side, I saved her from a dreadful marriage.<eos> You have no idea how much planning went into getting me inside the Louvre.<eos> The key to it of course was winning your protection.<eos> That gave me the freedom I needed.<eos> So, I've done you a favour in return.

We both know your name is Sophia Martinez.<eos> You and your lover, Francesco, are professional assassins.<eos> - I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - I recognised him this morning.<eos> Oh, he's dead by the way.<eos> The Musketeers killed him.<eos> But he'll make a pretty corpse.<eos> As you know who I am, you also know what I'm capable of.<eos> Who hired you?<eos> What will happen to me if I tell you?
Why?<eos> Isn't it obvious?<eos> He's a Spanish spy.<eos> As the Cardinal's man, Madrid knew he would be perfectly placed on his return to France.<eos> Spy master Vargas handled it personally.<eos> The Archbishop, the Chancellor...<eos> He's trying to kill his way to the top.<eos> He's determined to remove any rival for the King's trust and affection.<eos> Now,<eos> I told you what you wanted to know. Now let me go.
Who were they really, the bogus Princess Louise and her footman?<eos> Hired assassins.<eos> But who hired them?<eos> With both of them dead, we may never know.<eos> You have no idea who killed her?<eos> She was under the protection of the Red Guards.<eos> Rochefort can't lay that one at our doorstep.<eos> Athos, would you give us a moment, please?<eos> Earlier on, when I thought I was going to die, I realised I didn't want to leave this world with any secrets on my conscience.<eos> Give me a little time to regain my strength and I will tell you everything you want to know about your father.
Rhino!<eos> In here!<eos> They fit a whole rhinoceros in that little bag?<eos> Yes!<eos> Here!<eos> Have you got a giraffe in there as well?<eos> Oh, I know a Greenpeace fundraiser when I see one.<eos> A true environmentalist's work is never done.<eos> Come on inside!<eos> I'll write you another check.
Well, let's see if they understand this.<eos> No!<eos> Another unnecessarily angry director.<eos> You should suggest pet adoption, learning how to love...<eos> - Hey, you saying something about me?<eos> - Uh, he said he understands your feelings.<eos> You understand.<eos> You understand my feelings.<eos> Yeah, you sneak onto my closed set, you ruin my $4 million action sequence, and now you come asking me for help?<eos> Why the hell would I wanna help you anyway?
Martina, come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> It's been two hours you haven't said a word.<eos> Whatever the captain told you must have been significant.<eos> He told me who my father was.<eos> Is that significant enough for you?<eos> Martina, run!<eos> Get away from the gate!<eos> Yah! - What are you doing?
Remember you forced me to do this.<eos> Please don't hurt her!<eos> No.<eos> What the hell do you want?<eos> I'm looking for the Marquis de Belgard.<eos> You've found him.<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name is Porthos.<eos> I'm your son.<eos> Who told you this nonsense?
My name is Porthos.<eos> I'm your son.<eos> Who told you this nonsense?<eos> Captain Treville of the Musketeers.<eos> Treville...<eos> It was his treachery that ruined my life.<eos> That's our captain you're slandering.<eos> This is my friend, Aramis, also of the Musketeers.<eos> If you knew what I do, you would not take your captain at his own valuation.<eos> What else did he tell you about me?
My husband told me we have visitors.<eos> Your husband?<eos> Levesque, you met him in the grounds.<eos> Ah, yes, with the maids.<eos> You'll be sending them to the magistrates for trial, I suppose.<eos> No need to make an issue of it.<eos> Everyone deserves a second chance.<eos> That's very enlightened.<eos> I am Eleanor Levesque, daughter of the Marquis.<eos> I'll have the servants bring you refreshments before you leave.
Perhaps Your Majesty might try again this evening.<eos> My condolences, madame, on your husband's untimely death.<eos> You should take some time to grieve.<eos> I have offered, but Constance will not leave my side.<eos> Oh. Then we must insist.<eos> I can find other servants for the Queen.<eos> Rochefort is right.<eos> D'Artagnan will be waiting.<eos> Let the world say what it likes.<eos> I will receive you both at court, and then no one will dare gossip.
Your Majesty, don't let Rochefort stop you seeing the King.<eos> He needs you now more than ever before.<eos> What do you mean, Constance?<eos> The King is not well.<eos> And I'm certain Rochefort has all our interests at heart.<eos> To my son, Porthos, who was lost and is found.<eos> Raise a glass, Eleanor.<eos> I understand.<eos> It's a lotto take in.<eos> My wife is not related to you.
My wife is not related to you.<eos> Forgive him, Porthos.<eos> He comes from trade and lacks any breeding.<eos> I loved this man's mother, and will not have him abused.<eos> Now sit down and behave yourself.<eos> You say you loved his mother.<eos> What happened?<eos> She came to this house as a servant.<eos> We fell in love and married in secret.<eos> After you were born, my father discovered the truth, and ordered me to cast you both aside.

I won't listen to this.<eos> Eleanor has her looks but also her character.<eos> Shrewish and spiteful.<eos> Apologise, damn you! Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Just sit down, eh?<eos> I didn't come hereto cause a fight.<eos> We know why you came here.<eos> There!<eos> Take your hand out and go.<eos> I'm giving you a chance.
No, madame, it was you I came to visit.<eos> Your fortitude in the face of tragedy has been admirable.<eos> The death of a beloved husband and the loss of the security of marriage will be a double blow to you.<eos> My husband and I were not in love, but thank you for your sympathy.<eos> I always find your candour very bracing.<eos> It is an unusual quality, and most attractive.<eos> You didn't always think so.<eos> Perhaps not, but in time I have come to appreciate what a truly original person you are.<eos> I believe you and I could be content together.<eos> I wish to offer you the comfort you deserve, and I hope lively companionship too.
I noticed this young girl yesterday and thought I might have a little preview ahead of the main event.<eos> Get to your room this minute.<eos> A pity.<eos> The entertainment is by invitation only.<eos> And you are not invited.<eos> I can pay.<eos> How much?<eos> Admittance is 20 livre.<eos> That's rather steep.<eos> If you can't afford that, monsieur, believe me, you can't afford the rest of the evening.
Ah, he tried.<eos> Welcome home, my son.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm sorry gentlemen, this is a private event.<eos> Well, we've paid our entrance fee and now we want some fun.<eos> You're Musketeers.<eos> Off duty.<eos> Why?<eos> It's an odd coincidence, that's all.<eos> Who told you about us?
I'm sure if you sent for the King...<eos> Not the King.<eos> His father.<eos> Aramis.<eos> I was born into a life of duty.<eos> I have been privileged, but never free.<eos> Thank God I have one precious memory to sustain me.<eos> A fleeting dream of the life I might have lived.<eos> I can never be free to love as I want, but you are.<eos> Swear to me you won't let anything stop you finding happiness.
I want the truth now.<eos> Every word of it.<eos> It's true.<eos> De Foix and I left you in that terrible place.<eos> He begged us to do it.<eos> His father was going to disinherit him and Belgard said he'll kill you both himself unless we took you away.<eos> Why not just refuse?<eos> We'd sworn a blood oath we'd always help each other.<eos> I'm ashamed I thought I was bound by it.<eos> I regretted what I'd done immediately and came looking for you.
Because you felt guilty.<eos> Because you deserved it.<eos> I would never give the uniform to someone who didn't.<eos> You know that. We've heard enough of this.<eos> Shoot him, Porthos.<eos> Give me one good reason why I shouldn't do as he says.<eos> You know everything now, and you know who I am.<eos> Do what you have to do.<eos> Go on, Porthos.<eos> For a while there, you almost had me believing you.
Still, it is bigger than yours.<eos> The captain thought you might be needing this.<eos> All for one.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Dr Lemay!<eos> I'm sorry but I can't marry you.<eos> If it is too soon after the death of your husband...<eos> No, no, it's not that. It's...<eos> I'm in love with someone else.<eos> I should have told you before, only...
Yeah, I know.<eos> Dr Lemay!<eos> I'm sorry but I can't marry you.<eos> If it is too soon after the death of your husband...<eos> No, no, it's not that. It's...<eos> I'm in love with someone else.<eos> I should have told you before, only...<eos> It's taken me a while to fully understand it myself.<eos> It's funny how many ways we can find to make ourselves unhappy, isn't it?<eos> Well, then, it only remains to wish you good fortune.

If you still want me and you're willing to give me -<eos> Constance. Shut up and kiss me.<eos> I must go.<eos> The Queen is waiting for me.<eos> You've lost your mind, Rochefort.<eos> Leave now before it's too late!<eos> I can't.<eos> - Not before I know. - Know what?<eos> That you love me as I love you.<eos> I will forgive you any transgression so long as I know that.

Have you got a light?<eos> Those things will kill you.<eos> I thought you'd washed your hands of me.<eos> You know, I got to admit, I never thought you'd do anything this stupid.<eos> I'm John Constantine.<eos> I do stupid in spades.<eos> And how are you feeling?<eos> Like I've got a bloody marching band in my skull.<eos> Sorry I put a crimp in your grand game plan.<eos> Are you honestly telling me that none of you cloud-huggers had any clue that the Brujeria were back in business?
Go back to hell, beast!<eos> Back to the filth that spawned you!<eos> This one is not yet ready for your embrace.<eos> Forgive him his trespasses, Lord, and protect your servant from this abomination.<eos> Return to hell and the fiery pit where you belong!<eos> John? John?<eos> John, are you... are you, are you all right?<eos> Far from it.<eos> But I'm free of it, and that's on you.<eos> And I don't know about you lot, but I could murder a bloody drink.
NARRATOR:<eos> Previously on Gotham:<eos> I've been sober for a year.<eos> That doesn't erase the things that I did.<eos> But I still care about you.<eos> BARBARA:<eos> Dear Jim, I thought I could be strong and brave for you.<eos> But I can't.<eos> I'm going away for a while to get myself together.<eos> Trust me and I'll trust you.
Not yet.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to blurt all that out like I did.<eos> It's none of my business.<eos> Dr. Thompkins, you sure this inmate is going to be okay?<eos> He's fine.<eos> He's just sleeping off his meds.<eos> ROYSTON:<eos> I'm trying.<eos> Get a room, you guys.
Barbara Kean.<eos> My parents. They live here.<eos> It's very nice to see you, Barbara.<eos> Isn't it, Everett?<eos> Yes, very nice.<eos> It's nice to see you too.<eos> You've been well?<eos> I hope.<eos> Yes.<eos> And you?
MAN:<eos> Oh, I hope so lady.<eos> I sure hope so.<eos> FISH:<eos> Hell.<eos> What's up with them?<eos> What are they waiting for?<eos> First man that comes at a new girl nearly always gets jumped by the second man.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Here's a promise, boys. The first of you to come at me will die like... that.
- There's not enough time.<eos> - It'll be fine.<eos> - I love you, son.<eos> - Stop!<eos> [HEART BEATING]<eos> [JONATHAN PANTING]<eos> [SCREAMING]<eos> Hands where we can see them!<eos> Hands in the air or we'll shoot!<eos> - You think I'm afraid of you?
She was like that when we found her.<eos> Let's talk straight.<eos> Those people out there are using us as transplant donors.<eos> We are simply spare parts.<eos> Unless...<eos> Unless we do something about it.<eos> MAN:<eos> How?<eos> I have a plan. But you must do exactly what I say.<eos> You do as I say and I promise you, I will get some of us out of here alive.
MAN:<eos> How?<eos> I have a plan. But you must do exactly what I say.<eos> You do as I say and I promise you, I will get some of us out of here alive.<eos> That's right. No, you heard me correctly.<eos> I said some of us.<eos> Because the truth of the matter is, some will die.<eos> But we will die with dignity.<eos> We will die for a reason.<eos> And we will die next to family. And I tell you what... we are family. We are all we got.
Selina.<eos> Come here.<eos> You know, you're turning into quite a beautiful woman.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Remove the dirt... that old hood, these ratty clothes.<eos> How about we find a princess undernea...?<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Holy mOW-<eos> BARBARA:<eos> Take anything that fits you guys.
What are you gonna do, arrest me?<eos> Go ahead, arrest me, but don't stop there.<eos> Half the cops on the G.C.P.D. have a Cobblepot... and Loeb has the goods on all of them.<eos> That is what Loeb does.<eos> Well, it ends now.<eos> Jim, hey.<eos> Going after Flass was bad enough.<eos> - Going after Loeb is suicide, simple.<eos> - So, what...<eos> I'm supposed to stay quiet? Fall in line like the rest of you?
WOMAN:<eos> Aah!<eos> Aah! No!<eos> - What are they doing?<eos> - I'm sorry, honey, you're on the list.<eos> - Doctor's orders.<eos> - Fish.<eos> - Fish!<eos> MAN:<eos> I told you, didn't I?
CLINT:<eos> That's fair.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Outside, there's a boat down by the shore... big enough to carry the six of us off of this island.<eos> A boat?<eos> You have a better idea?<eos> I heard a chopper land the other day.<eos> Thumped like a son of a bitch.<eos> Why don't we fly out of here?<eos> Do any of you know how to fly a helicopter?
- after S.H.I.E.L.D. was crippled... - [Glass shattering] by a series of devastating attacks.<eos> No one seems to be sure how long the terrorist group known as Hydra - has been operating within S.H.I.E.L.D.'s ranks. - [Electricity crackling]<eos> But today, they made their presence known when they destroyed S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters,<eos> - the Triskelion. - I can't feel my arm, Mack.<eos> Can't feel it.<eos> Tim, I'm gonna need you to trust me now, buddy. - It's gonna be okay.<eos> - Once affiliated with the Nazi party, Hy... [gunshot] [Electricity crackles]<eos> Always with the Nazi stuff.<eos> _<eos> Now, which one of you is the chief engineer?
Then what the hell was it?<eos> - Skye.<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> This is great.<eos> We finally got the team back together.<eos> How are they all?<eos> Are you making friends? Yeah, how did you get the intel about the base?<eos> Can you control your powers?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. I promise I will tell you guys everything.
For example, I was yours.<eos> - Watch it, Ward.<eos> - Look,<eos> I'm just saying we all made mistakes.<eos> Coulson handed me over to my abuser, thank you.<eos> Skye shot me.<eos> After you killed how many people?<eos> Yeah, and we were a team, and a family, and you betrayed us.<eos> I know, that's what I regret the most.<eos> Not the lying, not the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents I had to put down, and I'm sorry, not even dropping you two in the ocean.
But I've been thinking some thoughts of my own, like... maybe we both kind of lost our heads.<eos> Get out of the way, Cal. No.<eos> You need to stop this.<eos> This isn't about us or them.<eos> This is about our daughter.<eos> Think of what you are doing to Daisy.<eos> I'm trying to protect her from the cruelty of this world... like you swore to.<eos> I know.<eos> I failed you.<eos> I failed you both.
- Fitz, now! Hit it!<eos> I'm trapped in here.<eos> That's not possible!<eos> What did you do? !<eos> - Science, biatch.<eos> - Looks like it's batter up, director.<eos> Stop!<eos> You can't do this!<eos> No, put them on the jet and get ready for takeoff.<eos> I can't let you leave with those crystals.
Well, I only wore it in action once.<eos> I punched Helix Rize and my boob popped out.<eos> Every time I fought him after that, he called me super tits.<eos> This is awesome.<eos> Hanging out with you, it's awesome.<eos> We are not hanging out.<eos> I caught you as you were falling at terminal velocity.<eos> And I did so without breaking your neck, which was hard.<eos> Now normally, I would have taken you to the hospital, but you were falling in the arms of a man with whom I share an incredibly complicated history.<eos> And you were dressed like me, which made me wonder if something very fucked up was happening between the two of you.
I mean, it's got to be some kind of code.<eos> And now he's got $400 burning a hole in his pocket.<eos> Mike just took the car.<eos> We need to follow him.<eos> How?<eos> I am not riding on your handlebars.<eos> Hey, Andrew.<eos> Can we borrow your car?<eos> Just for a little bit.<eos> Do either of you drive a stick?
More like the Krzeminski of the operation.<eos> Joke's on you, peg leg.<eos> I don't even know how to drive a truck.<eos> Driver may be a lead, but this guy Brannis is the key.<eos> Sorry, chief.<eos> I pressed Van Ert pretty hard in there on Howard Stark.<eos> I don't think he ever met him.<eos> Doesn't mean anything.<eos> Stark could have go-betweens between his go-betweens.<eos> If this guy Brannis is calling the shots on this deal, I'm telling you, he's our direct link to Stark.
Make sure the chief gets this when he gets back.<eos> You got a hit on my passports?<eos> Prince Charming's name is Sasha Demidov.<eos> You might know the rest of the story.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> He was dead before that battle of... wherever?<eos> Finow.<eos> Congrats, Sousa.<eos> You are the brains of the night shift.<eos> You ladies have a good night.
Concerned citizens call the cops.<eos> This guy called us directly.<eos> It's not like we're in the phonebook.<eos> Somebody targeted them, and I'm gonna find that bastard.<eos> Whatever happened last night, don't any of you forget...<eos> Krzeminski would still be with us today if it wasn't for Howard Stark, whether he pulled the trigger or not.<eos> We're only neck-deep in this mess because of him.<eos> I want action plans on my desk in one hour.<eos> Stay vigilant.<eos> I'm not losing any more of you.
Nice job.<eos> Well...<eos> - Good morning, Peggy. - Mm-hmm.<eos> You're here bright and early.<eos> I assume that means you'll be staying with the SSR.<eos> Haven't decided, actually.<eos> I just came to pick up my paycheck.<eos> Well, we'll keep the desk for you, just in case.<eos> - She'll be back.<eos> Which one of you fellas is Jack Thompson?
How did she die?<eos> Multiple stab wounds.<eos> The ambulance got there quick, but...<eos> My mom says all the family she knew about's passed on.<eos> I knew you were looking into her tenancy case.<eos> I thought you might be able to point us toward the next of kin.<eos> No, she didn't have anyone.<eos> Just us.<eos> We'll see to the arrangements.<eos> It's good of you to take that on.
So, how much is Fisk paying you to keep it that way?<eos> The reason that you can't get any of your crime pieces into the paper lately is because they're shit, Ben.<eos> Just like that one.<eos> And I think, deep down, you know that, too.<eos> You know what, forget about the suspension.<eos> Clear out your office.<eos> I'm done trying to help you.<eos> [music playing on video game]<eos> No, wait, wait, wait!<eos> I'm trying to help you!
Okay, just... can you do it with your inside voice, without speaking?<eos> That's a very asshole thing to say.<eos> - I'm impressed.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> And now you've ruined it.<eos> You going to work or what?<eos> Not today.<eos> Maybe never, not with Matt.<eos> You two have been friends as long as I've known you.<eos> Whatever's going on between the two of you... I don't really care... okay?
I've been calling you all day.<eos> Been busy.<eos> - Did you even listen to my messages?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And?<eos> - And what?<eos> You got a crazy old lady with a story about a young Willie Fisk beaning his dad with a hammer.<eos> He beat his father to death.<eos> He was 12, 40 some years ago.<eos> Jesus, why don't any of you...
Perhaps your brother will tell me.<eos> Well?<eos> Would you like me to talk to them, Father?<eos> I would.<eos> Lord Pallas.<eos> Please... step forward.<eos> No!<eos> No...<eos> You mustn't stand.<eos> Perhaps you should face your King.
Please... step forward.<eos> No!<eos> No...<eos> You mustn't stand.<eos> Perhaps you should face your King.<eos> I can tell that you are a man of integrity...<eos> Lord Pallas, a man who prides himself on helping his brother... counseling him in the rule of law, justice, and truth.<eos> Yes, I...<eos> No, you mustn't speak.<eos> But I want to help you, really...
What would you like me to ask Gaia... goddess of Earth and sea?<eos> Where is my daughter?<eos> I hear...<eos> Oh, the flutter of wings... and feel a cold breeze.<eos> The call of a kestrel.<eos> The Princess is heading to Mount Ida.<eos> Whatever for?<eos> A pilgrimage to the goddess Hera, sister of Poseidon, god of the sea.<eos> Why?<eos> To ask her help in convincing Poseidon to forgive you.
Why?<eos> To ask her help in convincing Poseidon to forgive you.<eos> It is my fault.<eos> Poseidon is an uncompromising god.<eos> Is she traveling alone?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Send out a company of my men... and our best trackers to Mount Ida.<eos> You believe the Oracle of Gaia?<eos> I want her home! I want her back by nightfall!<eos> I see you're keeping well.
This elixir guarantees a quick and painless death.<eos> It is yours... if you help me.<eos> This... is the ancient symbol for love.<eos> This... this means "heritage."<eos> What of the last?<eos> There are very few examples of this one in our ancient texts, but...<eos> I believe this one is the symbol for the human soul.<eos> Thank you, Priest Xerxes.<eos> The elixir!<eos> I should ask them to burn you alive, the end you intended for me.

Then you may rule at my side as my Queen... for the rest of eternity.<eos> Oracle?<eos> Yes?<eos> Did you hear me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm offering you the world.<eos> An everlasting life of wealth, power and comfort.<eos> Yes.<eos> But first... you must do something for me.<eos> What is it with you women?

And then will you restore Queen Medea?<eos> Circe gives your queen one day.<eos> Then what?<eos> Her body is mine.<eos> After waiting patiently for so long, Circe will feel again.<eos> Will we reach the door to Olympus in one day?<eos> It matters little.<eos> What?<eos> Why? You will not open the door.<eos> You will not know how.
Daedalus.<eos> We have shared much, you and I, travelled a long road together.<eos> We are brothers now, united by a sacred bond.<eos> Whatever you think of me now, whatever trust you feel has been broken, my heart has never wavered, not once.<eos> [Hades]: You have come far, Queen.<eos> Am I to be judged by you, Hades?<eos> I am not fit to judge you, but they are.<eos> Alcimenes.<eos> Have you come for us, Mother?<eos> I will stay with you forever.
He will get you killed before you lay a finger on the gods.<eos> Our success depends on respecting their terms.<eos> Do you really think you'll walk into Olympus and Zeus will grant your every wish?<eos> That is his promise.<eos> A promise from a god...<eos> I want no part of this. So be it.<eos> You will not get into Olympus without my knowledge.<eos> You must choose, Hero.<eos> Science or faith. Him or me?<eos> I need you both.
Guys, where's the coffee?<eos> Communist cake is served.<eos> It's better that we're doing this together.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Just let me do the talking.<eos> Sol, trust me.<eos> The trouble with your socialist dessert is it's very rich.<eos> It's a joke.<eos> It's just good you're trying.<eos> Sol and I want to talk to you about something...
No, no.<eos> Okay...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Press "Send." - If I press that button, everybody in the world who looks at this site is going to know I'm a desperate loser.<eos> Yes. But Mom, they're all desperate losers, too, so...<eos> I don't like any of my answers.<eos> Yeah, they suck. "Cultured"?<eos> You sound like yogurt.<eos> Mom?<eos> I am not taking you two for frozen yogurt.
I'm aware of a dangerous rumor that is spreading through this facility.<eos> Contrary to what you may've heard, Colonel Foster did not find a cure to the plague.<eos> This is the 2033 mutation of the virus... a second iteration of the original plague.<eos> Foster's basing his research on the first mutation, not the current one.<eos> But the virus has mutated twice more since 2033.<eos> Now it is an entirely unique microorganism... something quite alien... something we'll probably never fully understand.<eos> His vaccine won't work.<eos> Foster lied.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it gives his people hope... just as it gave you.
And if I succeed... they will never have been born.<eos> I, too, wish that the plague had never happened.<eos> The great minds lost... your daughter, my wife.<eos> But equally, I mourn the loss of who you might've been.<eos> I would so have loved to have seen her, instead of this.<eos> And very soon... you will.<eos> _<eos> I'm gonna keep asking.<eos> How'd you find this place?<eos> How many more of you scavs know about this place?
Boys don't cook.<eos> I only want to be here with you and Chuni.<eos> She'll have to go. We can't keep a barren sheep.<eos> But she's Mom's.<eos> Someday you're going to have to sacrifice your lamb, lest you starve.<eos> We'll never pan, Chuni.<eos> I promise.<eos> I don't want to leave either.<eos> But if we stay, we may meet your mother's fate.<eos> I'm indebted to you, Uncle Yakob.
Come.<eos> Dad, please don't!<eos> Lord, have mercy!<eos> Dad. stop!<eos> Enough, Solomon!<eos> You're going to make your daughter more ill.<eos> You people are aging me, I swear it!<eos> Before the foreigners board, General Tedros shouts:<eos> ustop!<eos> "I won't let you take even a speck of din from my land. Now take off your boots!" Without a word, the foreigners took their shoes off
Welcome to the database.<eos> Your employee lists, please.<eos> Grazie.<eos> All the hacking in the world doesn't make up for slipshod record keeping.<eos> No clue which ones are the delivery guys.<eos> No termination dates.<eos> Hundreds of names.<eos> Okay, one by one it is.<eos> Who just had a birthday?<eos> 'Cause one of you wanted Simon Cutler to know even as he was choking to death, that you were the killer.
You don't have to.<eos> Don't believe everything they say.<eos> If she doubts, it won't work.<eos> The vibration of your footsteps...<eos> That's what will chase them off.<eos> If you have faith, go.<eos> Walk heavily.<eos> Walk heavily.<eos> A snake bit her!<eos> I told you!
Yes and no.<eos> I am a Goines.<eos> I was a daughter.<eos> Daddy's feeding the worms.<eos> Did you know dad?<eos> We met.<eos> Sorry for your loss.<eos> Reds and blues... primary.<eos> Give me yellow!<eos> I could paint you the world.
You died there. But you were able to send a message to anyone who'd listen, just a voice.<eos> Now, the message that we have is... is broken.<eos> The data's been corrupted.<eos> My name is Dr Cassandra Railly of the...

No, go.<eos> If we need you here, something tells me we can get you back in a hurry.<eos> I'm not picking up anything.<eos> Not even with The Super Light.<eos> Super Light?<eos> Well, technically it's a multi-spectrum, violet laser-enhanced scanner that detects molecular schisms in the 600 mega-volt range, but I figured "Super Light" was easier to say.<eos> Right, but what does it tell you?<eos> Nothing we didn't already know about that night.<eos> Okay, keep looking.<eos> Uh, can I get you boys something to drink? Water?
Mrs. Stein, have you seen this person?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - He's not even Ronnie anymore.<eos> He's Martin Stein walking around in Ronnie's body.<eos> Any attempt we make to separate the two of them could be catastrophic and nuclear.<eos> ♪Flash 1x14 ♪ Fallout Original Air Date on February 17, 2015<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Barry?<eos> Barry, what happened out there?<eos> Are you guys okay?
Two imprints of impact.<eos> Two imprints.<eos> Two different people.<eos> It's Firestorm.<eos> He's separated.<eos> Your vitals appear to be normal, except you have a slight fever of 100.6.<eos> Cait, I'm fine, I promise.<eos> I know, but we just need to be--<eos> Shh.<eos> Yep--just when I forgot how awkward it was to walk in on you two.
What is going on?<eos> I didn't like the way I felt watching you and Barry last night.<eos> Eddie, Barry, he's just...<eos> Like family.<eos> I know, and I know you two have a long history that pre-dates me, but Iris, we live together.<eos> You're my girlfriend, and someday, hopefully, you'll be more.<eos> I don't like feeling like the odd man out every time you and Barry are together.<eos> And I shouldn't have to.<eos> Eddie, Barry is always gonna be a part of my life.<eos> I get that, but something's changed between you two.
Go faster, I know.<eos> A means to an end.<eos> And I'll tell you why.<eos> Because I have been stuck here, marooned here in this place for 15 long years.<eos> And The Flash and The Flash's speed is the key to my returning to my world.<eos> To my time.<eos> And no one is going to prevent that from happening.<eos> I can help you.<eos> You're smart, Cisco.<eos> Do you know how hard it has been to keep all of this from you, especially from you?
You've done so much for me.<eos> Let me be there for you for a change.<eos> And I can look at old family photo albums and see what little Cisco looks like without long hair.<eos> I'm rescinding your invite.<eos> Clyde Mardon has a brother?<eos> So both Mardon brothers survive the plane crash and the dark matter released by the particle accelerator explosion affects them in the same way.<eos> Virtually the same way.<eos> That's right.<eos> Only Mark's not like Clyde at all.<eos> He can do things that you couldn't even imagine.
Henry?<eos> Henry!<eos> Henry!<eos> Henry!<eos> Henry.<eos> Nice name.<eos> Tricked you.<eos> Look who's back.<eos> My tricks. My treat.<eos> But I'll give you something good... to eat.
Henry!<eos> Henry.<eos> Nice name.<eos> Tricked you.<eos> Look who's back.<eos> My tricks. My treat.<eos> But I'll give you something good... to eat.<eos> Today's special:<eos> A city in ashes.<eos> The Trickster proudly welcomes you all... to the new... disorder.
You have to admit. That was one hell of a trick.<eos> I cannot believe we're finally in the same room.<eos> I mean, you're my hero.<eos> You need a better role model, kid. Can't you see?<eos> He's just using you.<eos> Why did we bring him along? Huh?<eos> Because his son works for the C.C.P.D.<eos> Should we find ourselves in a jam... a cop's dad makes an excellent bargaining chip.<eos> Right.<eos> I wouldn't worry too much about what the cops might do to you.
You mean lie?<eos> Yeah. I need some air.<eos> Whoa... hey, Caitlin...<eos> Doesn't look like Caitlin's with us.<eos> No, she's with us.<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> What do you want us to do here?<eos> Business as usual while we're gone.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Well, I want to wish you good luck over there, but I'm also scared of what you might find.
Didn't take much convincing.<eos> Just the simple promise of his freedom.<eos> You ruined my life!<eos> All our lives!<eos> We stood by you after everything that happened.<eos> I can see how this must be difficult for you to understand, but trust me, your lives now are so much better because of what I have done for you.<eos> You don't have to hide anymore.<eos> We know you're not Harrison Wells.<eos> Just tell us who you are.<eos> A confession will get you nowhere.
You know what I can do.<eos> You want to kill me, go ahead.<eos> I'm not gonna fight you.<eos> But just tell the police what you did.<eos> Get my dad out of prison.<eos> I don't want to kill you, Barry.<eos> I need you.<eos> And...<eos> I also did not anticipate, as difficult as the past 15 years have been for me, how much I would come to love working with you.<eos> With all of you.
He killed Mason Bridge.<eos> Wells killed Mason?<eos> And you're covering that up?<eos> No.<eos> No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> If the world finds out about Wells, they find out about Barry.<eos> I'm trying to keep him safe too.<eos> Did you ever stop to think that looping me in would keep me safe?<eos> That if I knew what was going on out there, I could prepare for it?<eos> Maybe I could've helped you and Barry put the bad guys away instead of being in the way.
I'm trying to keep him safe too.<eos> Did you ever stop to think that looping me in would keep me safe?<eos> That if I knew what was going on out there, I could prepare for it?<eos> Maybe I could've helped you and Barry put the bad guys away instead of being in the way.<eos> Believe me, I asked myself that question every single day.<eos> Every time you posted something new about The Flash on your blog...<eos> Dad, it's not just about Barry being The Flash.<eos> You knew how he felt about me for God knows how long, and you didn't tell me that either.<eos> That wasn't for me to tell, Iris.<eos> Well, you know what, if any of you had been honest with me, maybe Eddie would still be here.
Dad, you need to rest.<eos> I can't believe Grodd became so violent.<eos> What was his lair like?<eos> Did he eat the banana?<eos> Does he like King Kong?<eos> He's more of a Planet of the Apes kind of ape?<eos> Uh, terrifying.<eos> No.<eos> And I didn't ask.<eos> Do you mind if I talk to my daughter alone?
- Huh.<eos> Darbinyans weren't known for hiring the best and brightest.<eos> You couldn't even die right.<eos> So you're so stupid-mad right now, Mardon, you're just gonna pick a fight with anyone?<eos> - Guess so.<eos> - If I had my powers right now I would gas you all out of existence.<eos> And then you'd be standing in a container with four corpses.<eos> What would that get you?<eos> Peace and quiet.<eos> I don't know about you guys, but I don't need my powers to fill this rig full of bodies.
Doors create boundaries.<eos> Boundaries are a bummer.<eos> You know what else is a bummer?<eos> Tall guys with small penises?<eos> That you just missed the gelato and designer coffee cart.<eos> Espresso hazelnut praline?<eos> We're not here for gelato.<eos> We're not not here for gelato.<eos> Awesome.<eos> It's awesome to meet you.
Wasn't that your stripper name?<eos> You're just jealous 'cause mine's taller and thinks I'm really, really, really pretty.<eos> Good luck with that tall guy scenario.<eos> Sorry we're late, but we were busy with our other business, the one we care about.<eos> How can I be mad with that sincere, heartfelt apology?<eos> Who wants to see our sample T-shirts?<eos> I want to see it, but I want to see a lot of things.<eos> With these damn cataracts, the best I can do is look towards it and get a milky idea.<eos> Hey, girls!<eos> I want to show you some of my new styles for my "everybody's merkin for the weekend" collection.
but if there's one thing I learned in business school, it's if you don't see it, it doesn't exist.<eos> Look, as much as we want to, we can't just look away.<eos> We need to talk to the workers.<eos> Call the guy, the one who thinks you're pretty.<eos> I don't know who you're talking about.<eos> We can meet them at that Mexican place.<eos> Ooh, a Mexican place!<eos> I forgot about the Latina market!<eos> Girls, when you're there, find out if they'd be interested in some hair south of the border.<eos> Didn't know if you ladies wanted beers or margaritas, so we got you beer-garitas.
- So about work...<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> Hey, let's go see what's going on in beer-garitaville.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> I can't get any information out of Rico.<eos> He's so preoccupied with how pretty, pretty, pretty I am.<eos> Oh, hi, Peggy.<eos> How are you?<eos> Would you like to join us and talk about work?<eos> Why don't we talk about you two skanks gettin' the hell outta here?
Respect.<eos> You two are a lot tougher than those girls from Saint Bridget's.<eos> What's happening?<eos> We're busting you.<eos> We know what's happening here.<eos> What, profit sharing and healthcare?<eos> We found a note in our box with "help us" scrawled on it.<eos> How do you explain that?<eos> Did you read the back?<eos> "help us.. "help you... to your full potential at American Ace""
What, are you kidding?<eos> What are you doing with this?<eos> What are you really up to?<eos> It's a present for you.<eos> It was supposed to be a surprise.<eos> We knew you were upset about the press conference.<eos> We wanted to do something nice, so we got you Max Hardy's address, the code to her alarm system so you can kill her.<eos> When the time is right.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> And I-I shouldn't have acted out like I did without talking to you first.

- What's the big deal?<eos> Because we asked you both to stay away from him. That's why.<eos> But he's fun.<eos> And he's cool.<eos> When he gave you this, did he say anything to you?<eos> He said he was sorry he missed my birthday.<eos> And that's it?<eos> It was good luck.<eos> As long as I wore it, nothing bad would happen.<eos> So I shouldn't lose it. And I shouldn't let you guys take it from me.
- I can't.<eos> - There are no grounds.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I can't.<eos> You didn't do this. You didn't protect him for Sally.<eos> You did it for you.<eos> Because, for some reason, you feel this guilt.<eos> - So you always let him back in.<eos> - Please take the kids and go.<eos> This drama between you?
I don't know what they were gonna do to me, but since I used the inn to bring the drugs through... now you're all in danger.<eos> What do you mean, you used the inn?<eos> Normally I'd say I'm sorry, but I'm not, because you're all liars.<eos> - Like it always has been.<eos> - Danny, would you just stop it?<eos> And you are the worst!<eos> You always took Dad's side.<eos> You never protected me.<eos> I've never felt safe in this house.<eos> And now, none of you are safe in this house.
Listen, you're all twisted over what happened to Barbara.<eos> - You're not thinking straight.<eos> - Yeah. Maybe.<eos> But I'm done in this town anyhow.<eos> What do I have to lose?<eos> Your life.<eos> Huh?<eos> How about your life?<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I thought the fix was in with you guys.
More like blurred.<eos> It's bizarre.<eos> No, it's guys.<eos> They're preternaturally built to bolt in the face of commitment.<eos> Been there, done that.<eos> That's what I'm worried about.<eos> What if Vincent's having second thoughts?<eos> - What?<eos> You just said-- - No, I know.<eos> But come on, you guys are like the frigging fairy tale.
Go, hurry.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Stop.<eos> You're gonna kill each other.<eos> ls that what you want?<eos> Listen to me!<eos> You have the power to fight whoever turned you into this, both of you do, but not if you kill each other.<eos> Don't lose yourself.<eos> Don't lose who you really are, what really matters to you.
We could destroy Central City.<eos> For starters.<eos> If we create a singularity here and then cannot control it, we could be looking at a global catastrophe.<eos> So long and thanks for all the fish.<eos> (Wells) Well, sure, there's a bit of a risk.<eos> (Stein) I would hardly refer to possibly causing an extinction-level event as "a bit of a risk."<eos> (West) Yeah, and your accelerator's been about as reliable as the beater I drove in high school. [chuckles]<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> How many meta-humans... how many dangers... have we faced this year together?<eos> Or did you forget that was me fighting alongside each and every one of you?
Let's not fight on our wedding day.<eos> ♪ There is freedom without ♪ [sighs] If it's all right with everyone, I'd like to skip all the Hebrew.<eos> [chuckles] I've learned a lot about merging one's life with another this past year.<eos> Yet, for all the incredible advancements in science we've all been party to, the mystery that brings two people together through love is still the province of magic.<eos> Mr. Ramon, the rings please.<eos> ♪ We know they won't win ♪<eos> I don't need one.<eos> I have everything and everyone that I could ever need right here.<eos> And... if all the events of the past year have led us to this moment, it was worth it. I love you, Ronnie.<eos> I now pronounce you husband and wife.
-How about 'banana'?<eos> -OK.<eos> -Here.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> -Thanks. -Be careful, OK? -'Bye.<eos> -'Bye.<eos> -OK, give me your phone.<eos> You will know in due time.<eos> Hello?<eos> Can I help you?
Are we gonna turn around somewhere or...<eos> You'll see.<eos> Where are we?<eos> -Home sweet home.<eos> -This is our family's place.<eos> -Shouldn't we get going?<eos> -I'm sure they're expecting us.<eos> All the farmers come up here for supplies.<eos> A few of them walk down the hill.<eos> Oh. I just thought I'd get you acquainted with the area.
We're stuck up here in the middle of fucking nowhere!<eos> No-one can hear you bang and scream.<eos> There ain't a soul around here for miles in every direction.<eos> Let us go.<eos> My advice?<eos> Shit is gonna happen.<eos> If you wanna keep all your teeth, just go with it.<eos> -It's easier.<eos> -What are you talking about?<eos> Let me show you our amenities.
Not bad at all.<eos> Please...<eos> Hello?<eos> No, sweetie. I'm...<eos> I know, I'm sorry.<eos> Look, I have to go, OK?<eos> This is just not a good...<eos> I will make it up to your parents.<eos> Wherever you like, yeah.<eos> I gave you the money, now please let me go.
I will make it up to your parents.<eos> Wherever you like, yeah.<eos> I gave you the money, now please let me go.<eos> Well, he did give us the money.<eos> True.<eos> Please.<eos> OK, Boris. Just one more thing and you're gonna be OK.<eos> Anything.<eos> Where can I find the man with the mask?<eos> I've told you everything you want to know. I've done everything you've asked.
One last shot.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> Well, how about that?<eos> I am... so sorry.<eos> I will never...<eos> Fuckin' bitches.<eos> -Where's the sheriff?<eos> -They killed him.<eos> -They said to free you.<eos> Who told you to free me?
We are wrapping presents.<eos> Christmas.<eos> It's tomorrow.<eos> - It is? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Hi, Harry.<eos> - Hey, Leese.<eos> One of those for me?<eos> - Yeah, the fruitcake.<eos> - Mm, nice.<eos> Same one I gave you guys last year?
Don't be an asshole, Seabass.<eos> See, t-the deal with Choo-Choo here is, he got, uh, - some shrapnel in his head... - Yeah.<eos> ... and now I spend most of my time trying to keep him from doing something stupid.<eos> Better watch what you say in front of other people.<eos> Watch what I say in f...<eos> Y-You just told him you were gonna kill a Marshal!<eos> Keep disrespecting me, you're gonna ride the train.<eos> I'm all aboard, Choo-Choo.<eos> Come on!<eos> All right. As much as I'd love to sit and hang with you guys, I should be getting back to work, but when I see the cowboy, I'll let him know what you said.
Need your expert hand up the mine.<eos> No, I can't do it, bro.<eos> I told you.<eos> It's a one-time deal. ATF's tight with the books and it could get daddy in trouble.<eos> You need to worry less about your daddy and a little more about your debt to me.<eos> Boyd needs more boom the shit load up.<eos> The good news is, you deliver, we gonna take care of you and your daddy.<eos> Man, y'all looking to get shot?<eos> Lord, I hope not.<eos> Was one of you gonna shoot us?
You want it to look right, don't you? - Yeah.<eos> - Far as he knows, two guys in masks busted in, touched him up, grabbed the keys to the Emulex shed.<eos> - Okay. - The cops see bruises on him, goes a long way convincing them he wasn't in on it. - Yeah.<eos> - Again, it's for his protection.<eos> You know what I wouldn't give to pull a mask on, take a few free pokes at my daddy?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Well, I guess we know why they stopped at a five-and-dime.<eos> Halloween come Early.<eos> You think they think if we don't hear their voices, we won't know who's under those masks?<eos> Were you boys not listening when I said we followed you here?
No, sir.<eos> The apology that I owe is for my craven attempt to pilfer that which rightfully belongs to you.<eos> As defense, I offer only my ignorance.<eos> Meaning you thought you were stealing from Calhoun?<eos> Yes, sir. I did.<eos> And now you know the prize in question belongs to me.<eos> - That, I do.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> And any, uh, plan that I had for my next attempt should be considered abandoned as foolhardy ... not to say unworthy.<eos> I hope you'll understand when I say I don't want to see either of you at the portal again.
- There's no way he killed anybody.<eos> - Come on. He's coming.<eos> Crap, we gotta go!<eos> Back exit!<eos> Go on!<eos> That side!<eos> You three, with me. Now.<eos> - What were you thinking?<eos> - Yeah, what were you thinking?<eos> Every piece of evidence in that hospital is potentially inadmissible because of you!
To try and stop more people from dying.<eos> I said I didn't think it was Tyler.<eos> No one believed me.<eos> But you believe us now, right?<eos> Well, considering his head is in that hospital and his body is in the car,<eos> yeah.<eos> Glad we cleared that up.<eos> Sit down. Don't move.<eos> I'm gonna need your camera, Audrey.<eos> Now all of you, get out of here. Go home.
Or, uh, three minutes, right?<eos> Shut the hell up!<eos> Will, stop! It's enough.<eos> Will, back off.<eos> Sit down!<eos> Emma, are you okay? No.<eos> Uh, I'm not okay.<eos> I know that our thoughts are all with the friends that we've lost.<eos> And so I just wanted to remind everyone that there's a candlelight vigil downtown tonight at 7:00.<eos> And I hope that all of you will make it.
The guest room.<eos> Mom wanted to redecorate.<eos> Now she may never get the chance.<eos> So why don't you just come out point blank and say,<eos> - "Dad, where the hell is my mom?"<eos> - I did. And he swears she's in rehab, but he won't tell me which one.<eos> He went out late last night, came back all skulky.<eos> I don't know, I just...<eos> I have a feeling something really bad is going on.<eos> Have either of you guys seen Will?
I've got the phone.<eos> I don't see anything.<eos> Someplace out past the crossroads.<eos> I'm going.<eos> By yourself?<eos> She won't be by herself.<eos> You'll be with us.<eos> Guys, no.<eos> This psycho is playing sick games.<eos> I cannot ask you guys to come.
Those children are lying.<eos> This isn't about children.<eos> Well.<eos> Look what the cop dragged in.<eos> Hello, Lizzie.<eos> I like what you did with the place.<eos> What happened?<eos> I got evicted.<eos> No home to go to.<eos> They tell you that?
Probably a customer.<eos> Can we not discuss this? You've brought a dangerous element into our lives.<eos> Emma, I'm concerned about Adele right now.<eos> She's out there.<eos> She's all alone.<eos> Adele will wander back, I have no doubt.<eos> So, uh, we hear you're having a party.<eos> Is there gonna be cake?<eos> Can we "axe" you for a piece?<eos> [fabric ripping] I catch you again, you're in trouble, you hear?
- Almost. - Can I see her?<eos> She won't be much of a conversationalist, but, yes, go ahead.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> This has to be the most cursed family I've ever known.<eos> You remember when I was little, and Daddy got so angry at you for letting me ride Rosalie.<eos> He was so afraid that I would fall off and get hurt, and I thought he was just being silly, because that's how I always was, so angry.<eos> But I understand it now, with you like this.<eos> I know what he was afraid of and why his fear made him violent.<eos> Daddy lost his wife, and you lost Mama.<eos> I lost all of you to grief before I ever even had a chance to know what love was, what a family was.
- So you're an angel.<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> And you are Witnesses.<eos> Our reputation precedes us.<eos> My name is Ichabod Crane.<eos> This is my partner Lieutenant Abigail Mills.<eos> A soldier?<eos> A cop.<eos> And I need you to drop that.<eos> I mean you no harm.
No, she didn't mean that.<eos> We had to run away.<eos> Is that why you left the forest?<eos> Yes.<eos> We fled the mine when things got ugly.<eos> You always said you wanted to give birth here!<eos> We wanted to leave all that behind.<eos> We started over again with our baby, and that baby was you.<eos> Emma, I beg you, don't get your hands dirty with that guy.<eos> I don't know who ignores me the most, you or your father.
Oh, that dick with the Aston Martin.<eos> I served him a subpoena.<eos> Gregory Spheeris.<eos> I sell to his wife.<eos> They're very talky.<eos> Look, you're obviously pissed off about something, but I'm pretty sure, for the first time, this has nothing to do with Kilgrave.<eos> He's smarter than you two.<eos> Kilgrave?<eos> Who's Kilgrave?<eos> Is he another one of you people?

It's like calling someone "special." They're not special, they're retarded.<eos> You're not gifted, you're a freak.<eos> What have we or the mentally challenged ever done to you?<eos> You saved the city.<eos> That's what the newspapers said.<eos> You were "heroes."<eos> Not me.<eos> "The city was saved."<eos> But I was there. I saw what really happened.<eos> I saw my mother crushed to death under a building that you people destroyed.
And now every single one of them is gonna know about this shit that you tried to pull.<eos> And they hate attempted murder.<eos> They really do.<eos> The cops hate it, too, you know, because it's against the law.<eos> Please don't kill us.<eos> We're gonna leave you alone.<eos> There's only one thing that you can do to save yourselves.<eos> - What?<eos> - Disappear.<eos> Nobody, especially me, ever hears from you again.
I'd say it's a good place to hold a guy prisoner.<eos> Sweet Christmas.<eos> That's some good herb.<eos> --Oh, shit.<eos> I got this.<eos> -Are you sure?<eos> -Sharp teeth. It's kind of my specialty.<eos> Easy. Easy, easy.<eos> Come on, guys. I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.
If I'm not back within two hours, please remove the skin from each other's faces.<eos> Behind the line!<eos> Stay back!<eos> Chuck, please pick up the phone so we can talk.<eos> Go away!<eos> I want to be left alone with my family!<eos> Is anybody hurt?<eos> We heard gunshots.<eos> We can help you.<eos> I don't want you here!
Stop. I'm gonna hit the switch.<eos> She is going to kill him.<eos> No, she won't.<eos> She's holding back.<eos> Come on, you cowardly piece of shit!<eos> You don't have the balls to fight me?<eos> This isn't you, Jess.<eos> We were happy.<eos> Whatever you think I did to hurt you, I'm sorry.<eos> What's the matter with you people?
I had to make people feed me and shelter me and care for me.<eos> That's how I learned to survive.<eos> Bollocks, Kevin.<eos> You always knew how to give orders.<eos> Telling us when to eat, when to sleep, when to piss.<eos> No, Albert.<eos> Oh, Dad, I've changed.<eos> Jessica taught me to help people.<eos> I saved children.<eos> I wondered if that would make you proud of me.
Oh, poor me.<eos> I feel your sadness, but where is your rage?<eos> Aren't you sick of hearing yourselves talk and talk and talk?<eos> I am.<eos> Well, look, too bad, I mean... That's all we've got.<eos> Jessica is the only one that can take on Kilgrave.<eos> Are you so sure that's what she's gonna do?<eos> She will try like hell.<eos> While we sit here and wait.<eos> Would this Kilgrave cat have hurt any of you if Jessica Jones hadn't pissed him off?
Look... it's not gonna change how you find or kill Kilgrave.<eos> - But it's important.<eos> - Yes, and private.<eos> So if you didn't have company, then... Ugh!<eos> It's not like you're interrupting some romantic interlude.<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause people are dying.<eos> Look, he obviously has feelings for you, and you definitely have feelings for him.<eos> I do not.<eos> Please, the chemistry was jumping off of the two of you.
Attention, all you trick-or-treaters, it's time to get your ghoul on, for tonight is All Hallow's Eve, my favorite time of the year.<eos> Our little town really comes alive on October 31st, when witches and devils, imps and monsters roam our town.<eos> As the holiday activities begin, the streets are filled with all kinds of creatures of the night.<eos> Some wear masks to disguise their dark intentions, while others choose to hide in plain sight.<eos> So warning to those of you collecting your treats and filling your bellies.
- The little kid!<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> Maria, she...<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, shit. Holy shit!<eos> No.<eos> Please don't. Please.<eos> - Happy Halloween, you fucking sicko.<eos> Now here's a tale for all you hood rats over there across town on the wrong side of the tracks.
Alice, guys, hang on, hang on.<eos> No, no, no, wait. Wait, wait.<eos> I know you, stranger?<eos> It spills the blood of the wicked where the wicked have harmed the weak.<eos> Think you turned yourself into a monster with that suit, boy?<eos> Mount up.<eos> Mom?<eos> Dad?<eos> You'd be little Jimmy Henson.<eos> They didn't do nothing to you.
Do you know why wear costumes on Halloween?<eos> It's so the dead won't know who's alive.<eos> And while some of them like mingling with the living, there are others who don't like to be seen at all.<eos> There's one ghost... who hates it more than any of the others.<eos> Mary Bailey was laughed at her whole life.<eos> She died being bullied and unloved.<eos> All because she had a disfigured face.<eos> But now it's her turn to have the last laugh.<eos> She comes back every Halloween to taunt the living and to laugh at them behind their backs.<eos> So... just a word of warning tonight. If... you find yourself alone on the way back, and you hear an evil cackle and footsteps behind you,

We've got hysterical blindness, we got neighbors attacking neighbors, kids looting convenience stores.<eos> There's even a fucking report of a UFO.<eos> I mean, this is bullshit, McNally.<eos> You're just the man to fix this.<eos> Just... get your butt out there and do the work 'cause if you don't, I'm going to boot you back to vice so fast,<eos> - Understood, Captain.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Good, good!<eos> Go bag me some of those horror freaks.<eos> What the hell happened to you guys?
I don't want to kill you, Gaby, not if I don't have to.<eos> Haven't you been listening?<eos> I mean, me and you are the same.<eos> We've both got blood on our hands now.<eos> I'm trying to help you get that killer instinct back.<eos> And Freddie here... well, he's suffered just like us.<eos> Freddie's boyfriend was in the passenger seat of his car when he plowed into traffic.<eos> There wasn't a lot left of that seat, was there, Freddie, when they pulled his body from the wreck?<eos> No.<eos> So I'm gonna let the two of you live, if you help us out, because we're not done yet.
He was helping pay for her treatments right up until she died.<eos> Any idea what happened to her apartment after she died?<eos> I think Lou was getting it ready to go on the market.<eos> An empty apartment and a desperate young man in need of a hiding place.<eos> Louis Carlisle, we're with the NYPD.<eos> Hello?<eos> If you'd like to test your skills in a practical environment, the floor is yours.<eos> That's a bit unwieldy for the job at hand, don't you think?<eos> Um, that's too delicate for the deadbolt.<eos> Would you two mind?
You're here.<eos> Mwah! Thank you.<eos> This is great.<eos> What's that?<eos> Behind me is the victim's car.<eos> Her 6-month-old baby, who was left alone in his stroller, appeared to be unharmed.<eos> He was taken to Children's Hospital for observation.<eos> Thank you, Tina.<eos> In addition, KCYD has learned that the suspect left a macabre note in the baby's carriage...<eos> Quoting now... "Raynard Waits wishes you a happy New Year."
King wants me gone.<eos> Wants to humiliate me.<eos> Thinks it sends a sharp message to the Pope.<eos> I feel like Katherine.<eos> Cast off.<eos> But still, I love him.<eos> What will we do?<eos> Bribe people.<eos> You still have land.<eos> Even if the king takes everything you have, people will ask themselves, "Can you truly give what belongs to the church?"
No one can find the paper work.<eos> The Cardinal will have handled the case.<eos> Do you think he'll remember it?<eos> That'll be the one with powdered pearls for ballasts and unicorn's horns in its hold.<eos> Yes, that'll be the one.<eos> If the case is in doubt, Sir, may I look into it?<eos> I don't think you have a locus standi in the matter.<eos> God, let him Henry.<eos> By the time this fellow's finished, the Bretton will be paying you.<eos> I'll say this for you, you stick by your man.
I heard a rumour, recently, about someone you know.<eos> Thomas Wyatt.<eos> Wyatt and the Lady Anne.<eos> It's an old story.<eos> If it's such an old story, why hasn't the king heard it?<eos> Part of the art of ruling, perhaps.<eos> Know when to shut your ears.<eos> Aren't the English odd?<eos> Christ, aren't they?<eos> But you understand, I think. She interests you.
Now, Henry.<eos> Leave Master Gardiner alone.<eos> You come along to the house.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Let's go to the house.<eos> There.<eos> About Master Wriothesley...<eos> And a good evening to you too, Stephen.
I have also read Luther.<eos> You have such a pretty way with Latin.<eos> "So, he that toucheth pitch shall be defiled,"<eos> unless his name is Thomas More.<eos> There you are, Wolsey always told me you were a man of the Bible.<eos> Thomas Cromwell, why don't you marry again?<eos> No one will have me, Lady Alice.<eos> Nonsense, your master may be down but you're not poor and you've got everything below in good working order, haven't you?<eos> Alice, what have I told you about drinking wine?<eos> Why am I bringing you to Westminster?

My father says I'm a mouth to feed and my uncle Norfolk says I'm a whore.<eos> I need a husband to stop them calling me names.<eos> Well... You should ask for someone young and handsome.<eos> Don't ask, don't get.<eos> No, what I want is a husband who upsets them.<eos> And who won't die.<eos> Don't ask, don't get.<eos> They'd kill you.<eos> You're right, they would.<eos> If she sent for you, she means to flatter you.
- What did you just do?<eos> -I hit Mark Smeaton.<eos> Only with one finger.<eos> Who?<eos> Is that his name?<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> -Utopia.<eos> Oh, what was the talk?<eos> The vices and follies of women.<eos> I suppose you joined in.
That would be a mistake on Rome's part.<eos> Yes, it would.<eos> Because he won't be told.<eos> What is he, some child?<eos> I've read Tyndale.<eos> "The subject must obey his king, as he would God."<eos> Do I have the sense of it?<eos> The Pope will learn his place.<eos> Why did you send for me?<eos> I've something to show you.
Here if you need me.<eos> Are you up early or down late, sir?<eos> Take the girls to bed.<eos> Yes.<eos> The King is in Greenwich, you are to come now.<eos> Well, then everybody back to bed.<eos> King wouldn't invite me to Greenwich in order to arrest me.<eos> It doesn't happen that way.<eos> What does he want me for?<eos> I really can't enlighten you.
If Your Majesty's brother died before he could reign then that was God's will.<eos> And as for your supposed marriage, well, we all know that that was clean contrary to the scriptures but...<eos> With God, there's mercy enough...<eos> Not for me!<eos> When I come to my judgement he will plead against me.<eos> He has come to make me ashamed.<eos> And I alone must bear it.<eos> I...<eos> I alone.<eos> Did your brother speak to you?
What happened?<eos> The King had a dream.<eos> A dream?<eos> He got us out of bed for a dream?<eos> Believe me, he gets one out of bed for far less than that.<eos> Was it a bad dream?<eos> "Was it a bad dream?"<eos> He thought it was.<eos> It isn't, now.<eos> Your children love you.
For what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All the things. Paintings, and books, and lutes... I don't know what.<eos> All the things we have now.<eos> # La la la la la # - You sir, are a Roman pauper.<eos> Sir, you are a fat Flemming, and spread butter on your bread.<eos> Well, sir, may your offspring eat snails.<eos> Call me Wriothesley.<eos> You look fit to be painted, Master Wriothesley.<eos> - What are you about?
Revenge...<eos> She waited her time.<eos> Harry.<eos> If I had known I would have waited dinner for you.<eos> I fear we've almost finished the fish.<eos> Shall I pray for a miracle?<eos> My lord, I arrest you for high treason.<eos> Your warrant?<eos> There are items in my instructions you may not see.<eos> Well... If you won't show it, I won't surrender to you.
I'm sorry, Thomas.<eos> He died the next day.<eos> They...<eos> They gave him a coffin of plain boards.<eos> And the city officials came to view his body so there couldn't be any false rumours that he'd escaped to France.<eos> They...<eos> They made jokes.<eos> They made jokes about his low birth.<eos> Count Wolsey, we are fetching you to hell where our master Beelzebub is expecting you to suffer!<eos> Beelzebub will have you joint his venison.
Never.<eos> Well, I think he means to hunt out of Chertsey for a few days.<eos> With the woman.<eos> The person.<eos> Your Highness will be going to another palace.<eos> He has chosen the More, in Hertfordshire, which as you know is very comfortable.<eos> It was one of your cardinal's houses, wasn't it?<eos> So it's bound to be lavish.<eos> I expected this.<eos> But I didn't expect he would send a man like you to tell me.
How is she getting on?<eos> What do you want, Cromwell?<eos> Well, I hear that she's telling people that if the King marries Lady Anne, he has only a year to reign.<eos> I just wondered who is controlling her.<eos> She may be a simple country girl but she has a genuine gift.<eos> She does, doesn't she?<eos> I hear she can tell you where your dead relatives are.<eos> If it's in Heaven, she speaks with a higher voice, if in Hell, with a deep voice.<eos> She can also tell what sins weigh upon a man as soon as she meets him.<eos> What would she make of you?
She wants a cash present for every advance above her knee.<eos> She's got long legs. By the time he reaches her secret part, the nation'll be bankrupt!<eos> I er, I had heard a rumour...<eos> She isn't.<eos> I would know.<eos> If she thickened at all, I'd be the one to have to let out her clothes.<eos> I know her waist by the inch.<eos> Besides, she can't be.<eos> Because they still haven't.<eos> - She'd tell you?
Because they still haven't.<eos> - She'd tell you?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Out of spite.<eos> I want a job.<eos> An official post.<eos> In the Jewel House, perhaps?<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> She made Tom Wyatt a poet and Harry Percy mad.<eos> I'm sure she has some idea what to make you.
It seems he's had her every week for the last two years.<eos> Edward's put the wife into a nunnery and I don't think we'll see dear old Sir John at court soon.<eos> And the daughter?<eos> Jane, is it?<eos> Pasty-face? Gone to Wiltshire.<eos> It's her best bet to get into a nunnery too.<eos> No-one want will want to marry the milksop now.<eos> What is it? It's only... ..a book of needlework patterns.<eos> You don't LIKE her...do you?<eos> Because I'm not sure it's proper for you to send her a present.
- If he was fixed once...<eos> - Yes.<eos> But the Cardinal fixed him then. And unfortunately the Cardinal is dead.<eos> Lady Anne, if the Pope cannot stop you becoming Queen - and I don't think he can -<eos> So shift him out of it.<eos> Do it.<eos> Beat his fucking skull in.<eos> Why don't you come up? !<eos> Looking for a woman?<eos> Oh, God, yes, I thought you'd come.
Now listen to me.<eos> You're a man whose money is almost spent.<eos> I'm a man who knows how you've spent it.<eos> You're a man who has borrowed all over Europe.<eos> I'm a man who knows your creditors.<eos> One word from me, and all your debts will be called in.<eos> What are they going to do?<eos> Bankers don't have armies.<eos> Neither will you, without any money.<eos> My lord, you hold your earldom from the King.
One word from me, and all your debts will be called in.<eos> What are they going to do?<eos> Bankers don't have armies.<eos> Neither will you, without any money.<eos> My lord, you hold your earldom from the King.<eos> Your task is to secure the north, to defend us against Scotland.<eos> If you cannot ensure these things, the King will take your land and your titles and give them to someone who will do the job that you cannot do.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> He respects all ancient titles.<eos> How can I explain this to you...?
The world is not run from where you think it is.<eos> From border fortresses.<eos> Even from Whitehall.<eos> The world is run from Antwerp, from Florence, from Lisbon.<eos> From wherever the merchant ships set sail off into the west.<eos> Not from castle walls, from counting houses.<eos> From the pens that scrape out your promissory notes.<eos> So believe me when I say that my banker friends and I will rip your life apart.<eos> And then, when you are without money and title, yes, I can picture you living in a hovel, wearing homespun, bringing home a rabbit for the pot.<eos> Your lawful wife, Anne Boleyn, skinning and jointing that rabbit. Yes, I wish you all happiness.
Your lawful wife, Anne Boleyn, skinning and jointing that rabbit. Yes, I wish you all happiness.<eos> You were never pre-contracted.<eos> Any understanding you think you have, you didn't have it.<eos> And if you think Lady Anne loves you - well, you couldn't be more mistaken.<eos> I've just come from her.<eos> She hates you.<eos> She despises you.<eos> She wants you gone.<eos> So if you say one more word about Lady Anne's "freedom" with you,<eos> I will come and drag you out of whatever hole you are cowering in and the Duke of Norfolk will bite your bollocks off.
I've tried other women, tried them just to try to take the edge off the lust... but I failed with all of them.<eos> Couldn't do it.<eos> Which is proof, don't you think?<eos> Proof of the rightness of my pursuit.<eos> I hunt only one hind - and she takes me from the path and into the woods...<eos> Now, away to our cold beds.<eos> Or is that just mine?<eos> There's work to do.<eos> I have a new post for you.<eos> I want you to be my Keeper of the Jewel House.
Give you good night.<eos> No, don't go.<eos> I, er...<eos> I think it's time I said my prayers.<eos> Benedicat Deus corpora vestra et animas vestras.<eos> You've been writing letters up to Chester.<eos> On his Majesty's business. Why?<eos> I'll tell you this once, Cromwell.<eos> You keep out of my family's affairs or you'll have me to deal with.<eos> And you'll come off worse than you can possibly imagine.
You may as well make your mind to it.<eos> I think... That's enough, Jane.<eos> They say the Barton girl has prophesied that so-called Princess Mary will be queen.<eos> Katherine is plotting with Exeter and Pole - all the old Plantagenets.<eos> - Don't distress yourself.<eos> - I'm not distressed.<eos> These people want me dead.<eos> But when my son is born, they'll all be powerless.<eos> Master Cromwell?<eos> I wanted to thank you.
Oh, my God!<eos> Aunt Claire, come on, up you go.<eos> Get some water, Heather.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> I'm sorry, I just-<eos> When I saw you come in through the door, I thought I was seeing a ghost. You look...<eos> You lookjust like her.<eos> LILY: It's true, Catherine, you really do.<eos> I can't even imagine how much you must miss your mother.
- No thanks to her.<eos> - Cat.<eos> - What?<eos> What? You think Mom would be happy for me, Heather?<eos> Despite the fact that she all but tried to destroy Vincent?<eos> - Cat, don't do this--<eos> - No! I am-<eos> I am sick of hearing about how wonderful Mom is, how special Mom is, how much good Mom did.<eos> You don't know what she did, Heather.<eos> None of you do. I can't-
Skip!<eos> - Police, freeze! VINCENT:<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Listen to me, okay?<eos> You've been infected.<eos> Get into quarantine.<eos> Come with us.<eos> You think I'm sick?<eos> I'm invincible.<eos> So you're the ones they're looking for.
Carroll's execution's set for the end of this month.<eos> Joe--you been to see him?<eos> No. I've moved on.<eos> You will, too, as soon as we catch Mark.<eos> Why am I letting you guys have all the fun?
- Martha... Martha...<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> Guys, you can't do this to her, and first of all, I think you do want to make a joke about balls.<eos> I mean, it's a bachelor party, but they're gay men, so it should be like a wild bachelorette thing with penises and balls and party games where you're pinning penises onto balls.<eos> - Yes, yes, yes, yes!<eos> - But we can't do that.<eos> They said they wanted a party that reflects who they are.<eos> Of course, they could have told us that before I sent out the Evite with a cowboy in assless chaps.<eos> - See, now that's a party I will go to.<eos> - We will help you.

Christoph Sensenbrink, as deputy head of the department, has done an excellent job.<eos> Now we need a long-term solution.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen the new managing director: Katja Bellini!<eos> I'm so excited!<eos> Good luck.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> May you always find fair winds and following seas!<eos> Don't screw it up. - I won't.<eos> Thank you for this opportunity, for your confidence, and<eos> I look forward to working with each one of you.
What do you want to do, Sawatzki?<eos> Ban elections?<eos> No, but I'm going to stop you.<eos> Have you never asked yourself why people follow me?<eos> Because at their core, they are just like me.<eos> They have the same values.<eos> And that's why you won't shoot.<eos> You can't get rid of me.<eos> I'm a part of you.<eos> A part of all of you.
How are you?<eos> - Good. Yeah. - Yeah.<eos> Is Simon home?<eos> No. He's at work.<eos> Yeah, setting up the new office.<eos> Hey. Thank you for the lovely gift.<eos> That was very sweet, but I'm sure that you spoke to Simon about that.<eos> Well, he might have left me a message.<eos> Oh. Well, maybe we wrote the number down wrong.<eos> Well, you see I made you a list.
Okay.<eos> - They're charming. Right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And they'll probably have good dirty jokes every once in a while.<eos> What have we got?<eos> Here.<eos> Uh-oh. "Thanks for a lovely dinner.<eos> - "Return the favor."<eos> - No.<eos> "Hope you don't mind."
Hey?<eos> Simon?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I think it's him.<eos> I think he's messing with us.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Hey.<eos> Dear Robyn and Simon, I guess I owe you both an apology.
- Chemical accident, third-degree burns.<eos> - OR's prepped and waiting.<eos> - What? On whose order?<eos> - Dr. Keller's.<eos> - Oh, Keller.<eos> Okay, fifth floor.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Fifth floor, gentlemen.<eos> Clear.<eos> All right, I owe you guys.
Aren't you the lucky one?<eos> But then I suppose you always are.<eos> - What did she say? - Enough.<eos> I find I'm most disappointed in Tony Gillingham. Don't be.<eos> He wanted us to get married.<eos> Our week in sin was just part of his plan to persuade me.<eos> Then why did you say no?<eos> Because, when it came to it, he wasn't right. At least, not for me.<eos> And you didn't think of George?<eos> I thought of all of you. I just needed to be sure.
Nora!<eos> Nora-a-a-a-a-a!<eos> Nora.<eos> What do you have there?<eos> You know, that faceless stuff Got me thinking about my old activist days --<eos> You know, students against the war.<eos> Hey, there's eggs, if you're hungry.<eos> Yes, i wanted to ask you about that.<eos> In an activist group, you've got devoted individuals With strong-held, high ideals.<eos> Did things ever get tense between you?
Bingo. Motorcycle girl.<eos> From the feed, 20 minutes ago.<eos> She was on the corner of 23rd and 7th avenue, heading into the subway.<eos> Damn it. What happened?<eos> Uh, the camera on the platform is down.<eos> Someone must have spray-painted over it.<eos> Pull up views of every stop on that line, And you -- get ready to roll.<eos> The rat has to surface sometime.<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> Remind me never to piss you kids off.
I'm afraid so.<eos> How long will it last?<eos> I wish I knew.<eos> Could be a lifetime.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll find a way out of this.<eos> We've got eternity together.<eos> None of us can make it through this life without suffering some kind of pain.<eos> Having lived through my fair share, I can tell you the most difficult to endure is loneliness.
- Over a year now.<eos> A year?<eos> Are you my dad?<eos> No.<eos> He's not your dad.<eos> Then why have you been following me f-for a year?<eos> Because you're that important, Tommy, very important.<eos> I couldn't tell you.<eos> I had to take you away before you found out, 'cause I was afraid that when you found out, you-- you would try to save your dad.<eos> I couldn't lose you both.
When what has been and what has not come together, we can make great changes.<eos> Witness with us.<eos> Step up.<eos> Your father was right.<eos> Yes. He has come.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> How are you?<eos> Time isn't perfect.<eos> Yet I'm envious how most of you seem to defy it.
_<eos> Skye, tell me we got it?<eos> No.<eos> It's gonna take an hour to reset.<eos> An hour?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Ok everybody, gather up!<eos> All right, round two. "Butts up."<eos> Oh, yeah. Ball comes to you and you miss it, you've got to run and touch the wall before someone throws you out.
That's why.<eos> In case you haven't noticed, people around here don't know I exist.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Even you do it.<eos> When I tried to volunteer for the Tug of War, you acted like I wasn't there.<eos> I thought roommates were supposed to look out for each other.<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't realize...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The truth is I'm not really one of you.
I love you, too.<eos> Bye.<eos> We're in my high school?<eos> They have plenty of restrooms, no flammable surfaces, and everyone's on winter break.<eos> Still, it's no wonder America got dumb when I was locked up.<eos> They're never in school.<eos> Is that you?<eos> Oh, and there's Bonnie.<eos> You guys look so innocent.<eos> Smiling like nothing bad could ever happen to you.
- Oh, my God!<eos> - Robert won't want them.<eos> Well, Grace won't either.<eos> I'll take 'em.<eos> Maybe I'll hang them in her car.<eos> - Birdhouse. - Oh, yeah.<eos> I'll take that.<eos> It's the closest I'm going to get to having my own place. Oh, man!<eos> You... see... You told me that you buried this, man.<eos> - What have you guys got over there?
- Um, well... Well, you remember when you used to say, you know,<eos> "Where'd my vase disappear to?" or "What happened to my crystal dragon?"<eos> Well, the answer is that probably one of us broke it and hid it in this box.<eos> Is that what happened to my grandmother's little Dutch boy?<eos> Hello, Hans.<eos> Oh, yeah. I broke that one.<eos> So you knew about this box.<eos> Yes, but they didn't know that I knew, so I'm still a good parent.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna take all of this,<eos> I'm gonna break it more, and I'm gonna make a mosaic for each and every one of you.

Oh, good God.<eos> Do I have to do everything?<eos> Galavant is the greatest hero of our entire kingdom.<eos> He will not participate in a joust like some common knight.<eos> This is a man who slays dragons.<eos> He is the lord of the... - Sword.<eos> - Lo... no, sorry.<eos> I can't.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Sir Galavant, we will advance you to the final on merit.

Lovely.<eos> Spread 'em.<eos> That is amazing!<eos> Gareth, isn't that amazing? It's really cool!<eos> Everyone, line up.<eos> Take a free shot at the eunuch.<eos> You know, honey, let's throw these poor bastards a ball, breathe some life back into the place, get some food and music and entertainment.<eos> I should probably start working up a routine with the Jester...<eos> - In my bedchamber, where it's quiet.<eos> - That's the spirit! Now, I don't want either one of you to leave your bedchamber until you've worked out a complete set.
You know, this is nice, us co-hosting like this.<eos> We need to find more activities we can do together.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Hello, Valencia!<eos> Here's one for you.<eos> Why did the chicken cross the road?<eos> Why?<eos> Don't ask me.<eos> Ask the chicken!<eos> Ah, well, that's the end of my set, so thank you all, and good night!
But you never complained. Not once.<eos> You never abandoned me, never spit in my ale.<eos> You've never done that.<eos> - Of course not, sir.<eos> Look, I'll play any part you want me to play here.<eos> But you should be proud of the man you are.<eos> I know I certainly am.<eos> What was that?<eos> That, my lady, was a knight getting off his high horse.<eos> Mom, dad, there's something I need to tell you.
She's not the problem.<eos> - Does she know you follow her?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't want the police to get their hands on her again.<eos> They won't.<eos> Do you know the story of the Nemean Lion? From the Labors of Hercules?<eos> For his first task..., Hercules was sent to kill an invulnerable lion, and return with its hide.<eos> He realized the only way to kill the lion was to strangle it with his bare hands.<eos> Sway is doing something... I don't understand.<eos> I'll need help from one of you to figure it out.
I'll do it.<eos> I can handle it.<eos> It won't be pleasant.<eos> We've lost so many.<eos> And we will lose more.<eos> But our... our hearts...<eos> We must not surrender our hearts to anger... or hatred.<eos> Be compassionate.<eos> Work for peace in your heart... and the world.<eos> Work for peace... and never give up, no matter what's happening, no matter what's going on around you,
Everybody went out and got Olympia tattoos after that.<eos> Yeah, I always say, let, uh..., cops do cop shit, but... it's always good to have a Power come in and deal with Powers bullshit.<eos> Olympia was a pimp.<eos> You wanna know what Olympia really thought about cops?<eos> He thought that every cop on the LAPD was his personal bag man.<eos> There to clean up his "indiscretions".<eos> Harley, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> - I'm dry.<eos> - We can fix that.<eos> Hey! I ever tell you guys about the... Three Titty Tony?
You know, in the stories how they say all's well that, uh, ends well, right?<eos> So, you've got "boom! Boom! Boom!"<eos> So my partner asks: "What's going on? !"<eos> "Uh, it's... raining assholes."<eos> Never thought a Power could get VD.<eos> Detective, grab a drink, join the party.<eos> Your dad's hilarious.<eos> You guys mind if I borrow him for a minute?<eos> - Go ahead. - Hmm.<eos> Uh, remind me to tell you guys about the time Queen Noir hit on me when I...
- Go ahead. - Hmm.<eos> Uh, remind me to tell you guys about the time Queen Noir hit on me when I...<eos> I can't believe fucking Adlard is still alive.<eos> What?<eos> Okay, I know it's hard for you, but could you maybe not make yourself the center of attention right now?<eos> You think I'm sitting in this dump drinking this shit whiskey - 'cause I need attention? - Hmm, yeah.<eos> I tell these stories because these cops need to hear them.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - They remind us who we are, why we all took an oath and put our asses on the line to do this job.<eos> I don't know what they taught you over in Sheriff's, but the LAPD has a long history that most cops are proud to be a part of. Especially at a time like this.

No, thanks.<eos> I have an appointment at the docks. What, nosing around?<eos> Don't worry, Jack, if I find anything,<eos> ~ you will be the first to know. ~ No, I'll be the last.<eos> I'm more concerned about you getting in too deep.<eos> Who, me?<eos> Look, these people have been killing each other for generations...<eos> I'll be careful.<eos> Promise me you'll be careful too.<eos> I thought I was dealing with you two clowns. Who's she?
Stanley, you're one of my dearest friends and I had no idea!<eos> We eloped, Phryne. That's the whole point.<eos> Nobody was invited.<eos> Don't forget the split step.<eos> Keep the contact point in front of your body.<eos> And you cut your honeymoon short. Oh, for the Sydney Cup!<eos> I couldn't miss that.<eos> And as Constance's coach, I had to agree, but we didn't mind spending our honeymoon on the court.<eos> Not literally, one hopes.<eos> You'd better save some of your firepower for the tournament.
We all thought he'd died during the war.<eos> When he turned up the first time, I couldn't believe it but if I told anyone he would've been court martialled for desertion.<eos> I couldn't have that, not when all he wanted was money.<eos> What about Mother?<eos> Why didn't you tell her?<eos> Because I thought Eugene was satisfied and after losing Janey and all the damage I'd done, I...<eos> We'd only just left it behind us.<eos> We had money, a beautiful home, a happy future.<eos> I owed her that.<eos> I owed it to you all.
Phryne?<eos> Flying all the way to England in that?<eos> It's the only way I can make sure he'll get there.<eos> For God's sake! What if this thing takes off?<eos> - Come after me.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> It was a romantic overture.<eos> Say it again.<eos> Come after me, Jack Robinson.<eos> When you two have quite finished...
For God's sake.<eos> Take the trash out.<eos> Mom!<eos> The water guy!<eos> Get back.<eos> Mete, run.<eos> Wait, he hasn't passed yet.<eos> - It hit the post.<eos> - It was a goal.<eos> We gave you a goal when it happened to you.
In the name of Allah.<eos> Problem taken care of. Relax.<eos> OK, no one saw or heard a thing.<eos> Now go home.<eos> Why did you leave your friend and come back here?<eos> What use are you?<eos> Why didn't you whack him?<eos> Dad, they're scared as it is. Don't yell at them like kids.<eos> It's all your fault.<eos> I told you to buy that woman's house right away.
No, the mosque was our next stop, Hodja.<eos> Quiet, Yasar. You especially.<eos> Who couldn't leave his shop?<eos> Now we blow it with the imam!<eos> Hodja, don't lump me in with them.<eos> I send my son to prayers daily.<eos> Stop talking nonsense, Nafi.<eos> - So it doesn't count?<eos> Each man is himself.<eos> - And with you, Hodja? - What?
This Riza guy. Wasn't he gonna persuade Madame?<eos> Forget that, but apparently he's rounding people up and telling them not to sell.<eos> I'll talk to Riza. Don't worry.<eos> You'd think we were doing something bad.<eos> Madame, open the door.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why are you beating on the door?<eos> - They want to buy Madame's house.<eos> - If she sells, they'll start building.<eos> What's it to you?
And that's two days detention for you, Mackey.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Wha... I got detention?<eos> I Googled South Park before I came here, and I could not believe the shit you are getting away with.<eos> People claiming to be advocates of transgender rights, but really just wanting to use the women's bathroom.<eos> A white man who thinks he's Chinese, and built a wall to keep out Mongolians.<eos> Ooh, I hate-a Mongolians!<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> I'm telling you all, this is done.
All right! Bring him in, bro!<eos> Whoo! Wait, what?<eos> Hey, no, I-I don't...<eos> All the pledges, take a shot!<eos> All right, pledges.<eos> We're excited you want to try and be P.C.<eos> We hope you've got what it takes to join the most socially active group in America. Whooo!<eos> Whooo! You know, there's still some people out there that say,<eos> "What does being P.C. really mean?"<eos> Well, I'll tell you what it means.
your investigations are going very well, too well!<eos> If you carry on like this there will be more and more work, and then NOTHING for years, as everybody will be dead in this city!<eos> Have a look over there, and tell me what you think of that.<eos> The next few days will be like HELL for you.<eos> You have got to find me this brute.<eos> Do you know who found the body?<eos> This wonderful body?<eos> A young boy!<eos> What the fuck was an eleven year old boy doing around here?<eos> I have to solve this case as soon as possible, even if I have to RIP a confession out of the two of you and say that YOU committed this crime!
The time will come, and we will come back to this "unfortunate misunderstanding", and we will take measures.<eos> The brain must be able to trust its arm.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Do we enter from here?<eos> Wait. I will look for another entrance.<eos> My dear guests, welcome to you all,<eos> I am very sorry I have made you wait.<eos> Your patience will be suitably rewarded, let me assure you!<eos> I know how much you have waited for this moment and I myself have been excited for days, let me tell you.<eos> I think you can imagine that when one organises meetings such as this one must be prepared for any sort of unforeseen event.
Let's eat.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen.<eos> We didn't serve the lungs because they are too difficult to digest, due to their very compact structure.<eos> The heart is nutritious and free of fat, such as the liver, but unfortunately one of the two "guests" was a heavy drinker, and his liver was too hard and not edible.<eos> The brain on the other hand is rich in cholesterol, and I do not recommend it, if you suffer from arteriosclerosis.<eos> That is the spleen:<eos> it is especially fine.<eos> My dear friends, I see with great joy that the specialities of the house are to your satisfaction!<eos> What wonderful guests you are, you have not disappointed me at all!<eos> As I was saying to you a short time ago, we have decided to keep the best till last, for the grand finale.

He cause any problems?<eos> None at all.<eos> Apparently he got confused about what day he had to be in court.<eos> And, uh, Pete's face?<eos> Oh, I, uh, I did that.<eos> We were roughhousing.<eos> Have you seen these?<eos> You do not survive a battle with these unscathed.<eos> Take it down, take it out!<eos> How old are you two?
What are you in for?<eos> Uh... they said something about burglary, but, uh,<eos> I mean, I didn't really do anything.<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> Joint's overflowing with innocent men.<eos> We've been framed... framed, I tell ya!<eos> I'm just messing with you.<eos> You can sit down, you know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you aware we're supposed to be quiet?
- Rule number five... - You're on, Mike. Smoking is a privilege.<eos> Rule number six... You can call me, uh, Warden from here on.<eos> Hey, maybe tell the guards to lighten up a bit.<eos> - Yeah. - I wouldn't do that.<eos> All right. Don't interfere. All rule violations to the guards.<eos> Rule number nine:<eos> failure to obey any of the above rules may result in punishment.<eos> All right, stand at attention for Warden Penny.<eos> All of you have shown that you are unable to function in the real world.<eos> You lack the responsibility of the good people of this great country.

Better pork than wearing a dress, dude.<eos> You know who you look like?<eos> You look like that guy from Cool Hand Luke.<eos> You know, the one that kills Paul Newman at the end?<eos> Haven't seen the film.<eos> Thanks for ruining it, man.<eos> Oh, it's a great flick.<eos> I'm partial to Captain myself.<eos> Now, I can be a nice guy, or I can be one real mean son of a bitch.<eos> It's all up to you.
It's all up to you.<eos> Oh, we should strike for better food.<eos> And more money.<eos> Just eat your food, 8612.<eos> Keep your comments to yourself.<eos> Hey, man. Can I have a smoke?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Smoking is a privilege, 5704, one you're gonna have to earn.<eos> It says in the contract, after mealtime...<eos> As for the rest of you prisoners...
They're just doing their job. Same as us.<eos> Uh, really?<eos> 'Cause it seems to me like they're having more fun twirling their batons than I'm having with my balls hanging out of this fucking dress.<eos> This isn't about fun.<eos> This is a job.<eos> Yeah, but for 15 bucks?<eos> Yeah, 15 bucks that I really need.<eos> Yeah, we all need it, but why should we be working twice as hard for it than these guys?<eos> I'm thinking we need to make the guards earn their pay.<eos> Visiting day is in two days. We would like to give you the opportunity to write a letter to the person that you would like to have come visit.
- 4325.<eos> - Uh, 5486.<eos> - 2093.<eos> - 8612.<eos> - 1037.<eos> - 819.<eos> - 7258.<eos> - 3401.<eos> - 5704.<eos> - Tell you what you're gonna do.
- Uh, 5486.<eos> - 2093.<eos> - 8612.<eos> - 1037.<eos> - 819.<eos> - 7258.<eos> - 3401.<eos> - 5704.<eos> - Tell you what you're gonna do.<eos> Tell you what we're gonna do.
Keep going!<eos> - You only did six, 7258.<eos> - I did at least seven.<eos> Yeah, good.<eos> You're finished when I say you're finished, 819.<eos> Get back down.<eos> I did 40 push-ups.<eos> That's what you told me to do.<eos> I did them. I'm done.<eos> Hey, everybody keeps going, unless 819 decides to join you for an additional 20.
Hey, guys.<eos> Guys, 8612 and I were talking in the hole and, um...<eos> I think we've got a plan.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Someone open this door immediately or face severe punishment.<eos> Blow it out your ass, Mr. Correctional Officer!<eos> - Fuck!<eos> - Whoo-hoo! Way to go, cell number one!<eos> We're with you all the way!
You will stay in the hole until further notice.<eos> You will remain here, and you will remain silent until we fix the door to your cell. Is that understood? Yes, Mr. Correctional...<eos> - Yes, Mr. Correctional Officer. - Good.<eos> Guys, wake up.<eos> Guys, get up.<eos> Guys, wake up!<eos> Guys, get up!<eos> Well, well, well, look at you three, all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.<eos> You know, you boys are in for a whole heap of trouble, but if you clear this here, uh, barricade,<eos> I can spare you a shit storm the likes of which you never seen.
Guys, guys,<eos> I really need... I need to speak to a doctor or...<eos> Or the warden or somebody.<eos> Quiet, 8612.<eos> Come on, man!<eos> Don't do that! It hurts my ears!<eos> Maybe you'll think about that next time you get yourself put in the hole.<eos> All right, you can fuck off, man!<eos> Now, because I am not nearly as cruel as my fellow colleagues on the day shift, your blankets will be returned to y'all and your dresses will be repaired.<eos> However, should you feel the need to defecate or urinate, please feel free to do so in the fine buckets provided by your correctional staff.
Okay.<eos> And find out which ones can start tomorrow.<eos> Got it. Until then, what do you want me to tell the prisoners?<eos> Tell them 8612 has been taken to maximum security.<eos> Get some more fear into them.<eos> As you know, today is visiting day.<eos> For the sake of your friends and family, I want this place made presentable.<eos> That means cleaning up the mess you've made, as well as cleaning up yourselves.<eos> Out of respect for your loved ones,<eos> I want you to put on the outward appearance of self-dignity, confidence, love, happiness, even if you have none.
I don't think you're supposed to talk about the hole.<eos> Okay.<eos> If something isn't right, you can let us know.<eos> You know that.<eos> No. I-I...<eos> Everything's fine. Are you sure?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Okay.<eos> We miss you.<eos> I miss you too.
There's no wildlife out there.<eos> I didn't even see a grouse.<eos> Claus, you are the next to go out.<eos> Yes.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I'll try again northward on the west side.<eos> Give me a few days.<eos> Gentlemen, sit.<eos> Sorry I'm late, Sir.<eos> Right. Some of you already know why you're here.
- Plus 10-12 vaktbua,<eos> I think it's a bad plan,<eos> It's a little late to come by now,<eos> When did you that I should come with it?<eos> You asked us what we thought.Joachim,<eos> Did I?<eos> Let me check the gorge tomorrow, It does not hurt to check,<eos> There is a possibility,<eos> Below Våer,<eos> I will talk with you one by one,
Wh... Hey.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> This is happening right now.<eos> They all seem to be posting about the same event.<eos> "We don't need to #SaveZoey, we need to #RunFromZoey"?<eos> When was this video posted?<eos> A few minutes ago.<eos> By Zoe<eos> It's Zoey!<eos> Loop Avery and Elijah in on this! I've been bullied, tormented, tortured by you.
So you need to help us to make it hold.<eos> These walls, you built them.<eos> So you've already done the impossible.<eos> Carter.<eos> Please.<eos> Hey, what you said before about us needing to take care of ourselves?<eos> Going out finding more people, that is taking care of ourselves.<eos> Your call, though.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You know, I can come with all of you.
Carter.<eos> - He heard. - I didn't.<eos> - I mean, I didn't--<eos> - Carter.<eos> He heard.<eos> Carter, don't.<eos> You can't.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm taking this place back from you.
You wished it to be Hodge.<eos> That's understandable.<eos> You were drawn to this case because you also fell victim to a sexual predator.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've known since our second meeting.<eos> If you are to hone your skills as an investigator, you really must know your blind spots.<eos> How did you take everything that I told you and come up with this?<eos> All in good time, Ms. Winter.<eos> Firstly, I've got an offer I'd like you to consider.<eos> Thanks to all of you, we were able to find good homes for more kids in 2014 than in any prior year of our history.
Anyway, the boy they banished because he turned thirteen?<eos> He figured it out. Came back.<eos> Set the whole place on fire and released the zombie bear.<eos> Well sounds like she was right about men.<eos> Look, Mack<eos> Bear?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you coming or not?<eos> Come along, little doggies.<eos> I found a new set of digs I think you're gonna like.
You're going to California.<eos> You don't even know if California is still there.<eos> Well look if you won't do it for humanity, do it for yourself, Murphy.<eos> You need that vaccine more than anybody.<eos> Have you looked in the mirror lately?<eos> You may be styling, but you're turning zombie, brother. Brother<eos> Maybe there are worse things than being a zombie.<eos> Maybe being a starving fearful violent vindictive human is worse.<eos> But hey! It is the Apocalypse!<eos> Let's have some fun! Let me show you what I've been working on.

Let's go in there and get it over with.<eos> This is the last thing I'll do for those parents. - You're spokeswoman!<eos> - I meant afterwards.<eos> We should have axed her long ago.<eos> Transfers come out in three months. By then, that loser will have ruined our kids' futures forever.<eos> - We know that. We gotta stand as one.<eos> Either like it or lump it.<eos> I ask just one favour.<eos> Let me do the talking.<eos> And when I've made our point, I don't want any of you to repeat it.
- Pardon me?<eos> Marina, I've been here for ten years. You need goodwill.<eos> Whining won't help.<eos> The East Germans do enough of that.<eos> What's it got to do with the east?<eos> It would've been different in the west.<eos> Easier. Who made herself the spokesperson?<eos> I'm your representative, because you elected me by ballot.<eos> Already forgotten?<eos> None of you wanted to be nominated.
- I refuse to see her.<eos> I can't guarantee her safety.<eos> A woman who badmouths her students is intolerable!<eos> Tomorrow we'll all go and see the principal.<eos> Or I'll call the school board and discredit the whole school.<eos> Alone, if necessary.<eos> - Maybe she went home and will be back tomorrow.<eos> Without her keys?<eos> Every normal woman has her keys in her handbag.<eos> Could one of you stand watch at the door?
Xanax.<eos> Klonopin.<eos> Whatever the hell those pink pills were.<eos> Those are for sleeping.<eos> Your mothers know you're a couple of shameless junkies?<eos> You're polluting your bodies with all that shit.<eos> You dumb Swedish meatballs.<eos> We're gonna fix that right up.<eos> Yeah, we're gonna You flush your system, bring you back to the epitome of health.<eos> Just look at the spread we got for you today.
Holden?<eos> Holden!<eos> Holden!<eos> Holden!<eos> I mean, maybe we should just go stay with Mary.<eos> In New Hampshire?<eos> I don't want to do that to Scarlett.<eos> It's already gonna be hard enough as it is.<eos> She should be able to sleep in her own bed.<eos> I'm gonna have two uniformed men with you at all times.
I mean, do you think that he knows where we live?<eos> Jesus, John.<eos> What are we gonna do, huh?<eos> Maybe I should get a gun. No.<eos> No, you-you don't need to get a gun, all right?<eos> There are ways to clone somebody's phone, all right?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna keep you guys safe.<eos> What, by moving out?<eos> I have a feeling he's gonna come after me again, and if that happens, I don't want either of you near me.
You okay?<eos> Vince, what's wrong?<eos> - Vince. - [retching]<eos> - You seemed so mysterious back in school.<eos> - [chuckles]<eos> - Yeah? - No, it's true.<eos> Don't take it the wrong way.<eos> It's just that the whole Mennonite thing... it just made all of you seem like foreigners.<eos> What?<eos> I know. I'm sorry that sounded kind of prejudiced, but... it's just that you all stayed so close together and no one saw you outside of school.
Yeah. What were you in for?<eos> Jaywalking.<eos> I don't like this at all... breaking into a prison.<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> No.<eos> I guess we're in this together.<eos> Who would've guessed?<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> What's going on? These guys resisted.<eos> They say they don't want to be decontaminated. Hard to believe you kids want to stay that badly.
Who?<eos> Charles Laney, handled the Harrison bankruptcy.<eos> See what you can find out.<eos> Will do, and I have something kind of interesting.<eos> Talked to Lieutenant Bradey in arson, says the weird fire pattern sounds a lot like a case an old partner of his was following.<eos> Same M.O. He was never able to crack it.<eos> Says his partner was a little obsessed with nailing this firebug.<eos> You know, the one that always got away.<eos> Let's talk to this cop.<eos> If he'll talk to you.
Why?<eos> Because the man he hired to burn down your building is gonna kill him. - No, you're wrong...<eos> - We don't have time to argue.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - He's at the building.<eos> I-I was just on my way to meet him.<eos> He's with one of your arson investigators. Who?<eos> He said his name was Lieutenant Johnson.<eos> We don't have a Lieutenant Johnson in arson.<eos> It's got to be Barso, and he's got his dad, and I'm telling you, guys, he's gonna kill him.
Get him out of here.<eos> Get him in the car.<eos> - Rosalee.<eos> - We got what you need.<eos> And we think we figured out how to apply it.<eos> You want to come by and get it?<eos> - No, we need you to bring it. - Where?<eos> You don't know your son hated this store?<eos> He didn't want to spend the rest of his life in this place.<eos> See, that's the problem with you parents.
Do you have a suspect?<eos> We haven't gotten too far in that investigation.<eos> Can you show me where you found the body? I can do that easy peasy.<eos> Keep me in the loop.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> I've been distracted lately.<eos> Well, it seemed to coincide with Mike coming back. No.<eos> That's not it. It's... you know, it's the recent murders and the... the everything.<eos> It's just it's brought up a lot of stuff for me. You sure?<eos> It feels like whenever I'm around the two of you there's unfinished business.
Thanks.<eos> Let's have someone read.<eos> The young man in glasses, please.<eos> Italian would suit me.<eos> - That's mine.<eos> - It was on the floor.<eos> I thought it was yours.<eos> It is, but...<eos> Thanks.<eos> Can I come with you?
It pissed me off, waiting a half-hour outside the cinema.<eos> 30 minutes!<eos> Fred, my sister.<eos> Lina from uni.<eos> She's sleeping here tonight.<eos> Sleeping here?<eos> She can sleep in my room.<eos> - Put your things here.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I can't tell you, I...
Joseph Beuys:<eos> "Explanation of a Painting to a Dead Hare", 1965.<eos> Also Richard Kern with a Christ covered in excrement.<eos> And Rodolphe Schwartz Kogler and his nude wrapped in wet bandages and electric wires, live ones, beneath a hail of razorblades.<eos> Are these artists illusionists as Plato would think?<eos> Or, as art is "anything", are they violent artists?<eos> How can we qualify such liberty?<eos> Such intoxication in action?<eos> What use is it all?<eos> I'm asking you that.

I'm very happy I met you.<eos> I think you're stunning.<eos> You're a gorgeous woman.<eos> You mean you want to sleep with me?<eos> Don't you?<eos> No.<eos> You're scared?<eos> You like being scared?<eos> Let's talk about Marivaux.<eos> I'll tell you a secret.
Unlock it or I'll break it down!<eos> Keep away!<eos> You stubborn idiot!<eos> Get out!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Everyone out!<eos> All of you!<eos> Get out of my sight!<eos> I'm sick of you all!
I don't take orders from traitors.<eos> Watch your mouth, soldier.<eos> Mind who you're talking to.<eos> You were working with the enemy.<eos> I followed you.<eos> I was doing what I had to do to complete my mission, which I did.<eos> That's more than you can say, but then again, no one ever expected much from you, did they?<eos> You're wounded.<eos> Weak.<eos> I could just end you both right now, take what you found and bring it back to mother.
See that?<eos> Escort party, dude, escort party!<eos> Come on!<eos> Sister!<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> Sister, please!<eos> She's screaming, man!<eos> Fucking great!<eos> Sister, please. Come!<eos> You're funny. You were like, "Shhh!"
- You were in jail'?<eos> - Yeah. Blinker visited him.<eos> Three times?<eos> Sister, I visit him three times. I give him everything he want. What he want.<eos> - He was really a good friend.<eos> - How many times you...<eos> You smoke?<eos> You don't smoke, then don't.<eos> - I don't wanna get her hooked!<eos> - Oh, you're so righteous.
Are you stupid? I was asking her!<eos> And don't talk to me like a retard!<eos> I hate that! - She's doing it!<eos> - Just calm down.<eos> - You need to calm down!<eos> - You both need to calm down.<eos> - Sister, you drive.<eos> - Yeah, I drive.<eos> I'm the big driver!<eos> Are you OK, right, guys?
What?<eos> - I don't like it.<eos> - How is that?<eos> He's such a moron.<eos> What happens with him?<eos> How do you say 'gerade aus'?<eos> Just straight, man.<eos> - Straight?<eos> - Just go.<eos> I'm gonna drive you, man.
Look at this.<eos> I did the math.<eos> The test was 30% of my final grade.<eos> So to get above a "C" in the class...<eos> You'd have to ace everything else.<eos> And that's not happening.<eos> A "C" isn't even good enough to get into a good med school, right?<eos> Do you think I should drop the class and try to take it again next semester?<eos> Only you can make that decision.<eos> You guys have been apart for a while and it's gonna take you some time to readjust.
Do you know that she didn't even make honors society in high school?<eos> Oh, you did not look that up.<eos> Just focus on Marillo, okay?<eos> This is an opportunity to make a connection.<eos> But you're coming, right?<eos> (Laughs) Um... Isn't this more of like a social thing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That's the point.<eos> Yeah, I don't think you want me with you in Marillo's house.<eos> What happened between you two?
So, you got your ankle monitor off. That had to have felt good.<eos> So good you went to a party and stayed out all night, and you didn't call us.<eos> Which I explained.<eos> And it's pretty clear you'd been drinking.<eos> I hate to break it to you guys, but I have had a drink before.<eos> Sweetie, I need to ask you something.<eos> When you told me about your friend Tess, who got so drunk that she didn't remember sleeping with a guy...<eos> I told you that in confidence.<eos> I know, but now I need to know. Was that girl you?<eos> God, you guys, don't you think I would come to you if I wanted to talk about something like that?
You and Max get Strauss.<eos> Max, take Strauss to the car.<eos> Mike, no!<eos> You just left her?<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> I was gonna kill the man that murdered my father until you got into my head!<eos> Strauss could have taken a boat to Beacon.<eos> Could be a hunting ground for one of Strauss' students.<eos> Tell us where he is.<eos> Why would I tell you anything?
Come on.<eos> You're about to meet the baron.<eos> He's welcoming the new recruits.<eos> People once thought this a holy book.<eos> They believed it held the answers from a god that would save them.<eos> Boys, there is no god in the badlands.<eos> How do I know?<eos> A god does not feed you or clothe you or protect you.<eos> I do.<eos> Most of you are orphans. Your parents died after a life of servitude and left you to pay off their debt.

Your parents died after a life of servitude and left you to pay off their debt.<eos> But I'm offering you a different path.
Are you OK? Yes!<eos> I'm glad you're taking Claude's dogs to the mas.<eos> Too messy for you, huh?<eos> No!<eos> I'm pleased you're not alone up there.<eos> Come in.<eos> You never forgave your dad, huh?<eos> I've never forgiven you.<eos> Let's go!<eos> What am I going to do with you?
When we almost died, I promised them a share of my inheritance. I kept my word.<eos> Then it was every man for himself.<eos> Why?<eos> Two of you are dead, from lacerations.<eos> And you're afraid for me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you in danger?<eos> I didn't want to bother you, but I'm worried.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> In Algeria, did anything happen between you?
It doesn't hurt anymore.<eos> I can't take it when you're in pain.<eos> I gave you painkillers. Don't worry. It's only plants.<eos> Anything else you need to tell me, David?<eos> Yes.<eos> In the drawer, there were love letters.<eos> From an ex whom I hurt. That's why I kept them.<eos> I left her for you.<eos> But that's all.<eos> I would like you to finish this sentence:
- If you want, I have a guest room.<eos> - No, stop it.<eos> OK. My name is Henri Duvallois. I'm a widow.<eos> And I also like things that are simple, sincere and healthy.<eos> Is that OK?<eos> Lila Garfin, no children, single and...<eos> I'm a good fashion designer.<eos> A woman in leopard print has no scruples.<eos> She's a gold-digger. You'll see.<eos> She'll steal everything from you.
A woman in leopard print has no scruples.<eos> She's a gold-digger. You'll see.<eos> She'll steal everything from you.<eos> She seemed nice to me.<eos> "Nice..." Mrs Fargeot was nice too.<eos> Then she stole from her husband and went to Paris.<eos> Like Mathilde.<eos> A woman in leopard is a woman who cheats.<eos> But it's not my father, or my farm.<eos> But let me tell you, she won't leave you anything.
Grandfather was clear. If she's here, he won't sell.<eos> Never.<eos> He can't tell me what to do.<eos> No one can.<eos> Listen, you're right.<eos> I'm from the city, and... I'm out of my element here.<eos> I'm scared of animals, and I get hay fever.<eos> I know nothing about farming.<eos> That's all true, but I'm willing and ready to learn.<eos> And I want to be useful, and be with you.
Grandfather?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> Are you going to let me in or leave me here to rot?<eos> Excuse me. I'll be right back. Come in.<eos> Give me a break.<eos> So it appears you've all adopted the Parisian.<eos> She's fine, Grandfather. I swear.<eos> She's really trying, and she makes Dad happy.<eos> So it's true. She's living with you all?
Just, you know... move along.<eos> Ruby.<eos> Are you sure he knows it's today?<eos> I reminded him three times.<eos> He should be here.<eos> Branch Connally, my son... did not take his own life.<eos> He was a deputy of the Absaroka County Sheriff's Department.<eos> And that job took his life.<eos> Branch emptied himself out... trying to help other people.<eos> Trying to help all of you.
But they don't.<eos> Okay, so we need to find out who hacked the CIA.<eos> That's who likely put the information in the game. Why are we standing here?<eos> Hey.<eos> Fill me in.<eos> There's no time.<eos> He's my son.<eos> Make time.<eos> You know, with your history, I would be cautious saying that.<eos> This is not about either of you.
But that might get him running, Cabe.<eos> The kid on stage just got very alert to you.<eos> Talking with your finger in your ear might have tipped him.<eos> And I think he made me, too.<eos> Yeah! He's running.<eos> Keep your eye on him.<eos> Great, we lost him. I got this.<eos> I can fix it.<eos> Attention, fans of this game.<eos> We trust you're enjoying your promotional hooded capes.
That's why I picked my nose earlier... to gross you out.<eos> Yeah, burnt.<eos> I know what you're trying to do here.<eos> Wearing clothes you clearly can't afford, scamming your way into this party, flirting with Logan Beekman?<eos> I haven't even started to flirt, Xan.<eos> Just wait till a little fellow called Mr. Tongue comes out to play.<eos> You think I'm gonna let you use my family to live out some little gold digger fairy tale?<eos> Wait, what?<eos> I'm just having fun.<eos> People like me and Logan Beekman, we see right through people like you.
- To girlfriends. - Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> This prosecco's making me frisky.<eos> Wink, wink.<eos> Frisky for sex.<eos> Come on, Phil.<eos> When duty calls, huh?<eos> Committed to this marriage.<eos> Wink, wink.<eos> You guys have fun.
Guys?<eos> We listening here?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Okay, good, 'cause this is really cool stuff.<eos> You listening or are you pinching?<eos> We're listening.<eos> -Both.<eos> Okay, so when you have a complaint, all you do is you write it up on the board, then we can vote on this stuff.<eos> Now, how does the voting process work?<eos> I'm about to tell you.
I'm about to tell you.<eos> Say you want to make ice cream illegal, which is crazy because ice cream is delicious, but what I would do is write up on the board, "ice cream should be illegal", then I would motion for a vote...<eos> Okay, I would like to vote to keep ice cream legal.<eos> Carol, that was an example.<eos> Ice cream remains legal.<eos> Boom.<eos> Boom, indeed.<eos> That leads me to a motion that I'd like to make.<eos> Since we're trying to form a family-friendly community, our sexual dalliances cannot be so frigging in-your-face.<eos> And I am looking at you, Todd and Melissa.
Oh, you're serious?<eos> Phil, we have to keep this cow alive for milk.<eos> Hey, we don't know how to take care of an animal like this.<eos> I mean, this thing will be dead in, like, three weeks.<eos> So let's just do the humane thing and murder it now so we can have burgers tonight.<eos> You know, Phil, I might be able to help us out here.<eos> You've killed a cow before?<eos> No. As a kid, I used to spend my summers on my uncle's dairy farm.<eos> So you know how to milk it?<eos> I can get you milk, I can churn you butter.
Uh, yes, it does.<eos> Clearly you've forgotten about a little something called finders keepers.<eos> Finders keepers?<eos> Are you five years old?<eos> And like clockwork, the losers weep.<eos> Phil, we aren't children, and this isn't a playground.<eos> Doy!<eos> Come on, Phil.<eos> Yeah, this is ridiculous!<eos> Hey, hey, I'm not trying to fight with you here, okay?

So were you the one who put up those "Alive in Tucson" billboards?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Those were mine. I-I...<eos> I did that.<eos> So, it's just you?<eos> You're-you're all alone out here?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> It's just me.<eos> It's just me.<eos> Do you mind?
You know what?<eos> I should probably head out for a few.<eos> No.<eos> - Did we scare you off?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I just got to go deal with some stuff.<eos> You know, feed the meter, check the stove, drop by the bank.<eos> Do you want to come back for dinner?<eos> I would love to come to dinner.<eos> So... I will see you guys in a couple hours.
I'm just that kind of person.<eos> Awful.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> Yeah, sometimes I'd be tamping her forehead with a cool cloth, and she'd look up to me and she'd say, through her oxygen mask:<eos> "Phil, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me."<eos> - Aw... dear...<eos> - My God, Phil.<eos> My God.<eos> She said that.<eos> Thank you, that feels good.
It's as... painful as it was the first time.<eos> Just take me home, okay?<eos> About that...<eos> The magnetoencephalography machine will map when your memories are activated.<eos> TECH: Almost set.<eos> Can you guys tell me what the emergency is?<eos> Like, um, is this guy a spy or something?<eos> That's need-to-know.<eos> Y-You know, this-this isn't going to work, guys.<eos> I've already told you everything I can recall.
Looks like Strauss is covering his tracks.<eos> There you are.<eos> I was starting to worry.<eos> Kyle is dead.<eos> It's your fault.<eos> You're emotional.<eos> I understand that.<eos> Kyle was a good man.<eos> Maybe not my brightest student but a loyal one.<eos> I promised him... I would help you both start new lives if you helped me, and... I consider myself a man of my word.
She did not know that I like a sandwich hot.<eos> Please do not bite!<eos> How to welcoming a crazy boxer, but is no better.<eos> Please do not rape, Mister Tyson.<eos> I am still so young!<eos> We say goodbye to our son and classmate ...<eos> Oh my God!<eos> Zombie-Alarm!<eos> "Bonjour la classe." Sit down now, please.<eos> As little surprise I brought you a new book.
Unbelievable, right?<eos> Camilla has told me.<eos> This is not a therapy, only a sports course.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Sport is good.<eos> Oh my goodness!<eos> I just noticed that you Frank look really similar.<eos> Bernadette, it's enough.<eos> To be with yourself in line is important, but also to harmonize with others.<eos> We now form pairs, I bring you waltz in.
You transported a box from the airport across the river into Manhattan.<eos> It cost me my mother.<eos> - Infect the infected.<eos> - Find a weak link in the vampire biology and cook something up to exploit it.<eos> Something that the vampires are vulnerable to, but that - non-turned humans can tolerate.<eos> - When do we test transmission?<eos> Tonight.<eos> Angel!<eos> - Break time is over.<eos> I've seen a lot of strange things since I hooked up with you two, and I've done a lot of strange things, you know?
Of course you fight for yourself.<eos> You always fight for only yourself.<eos> Fet need food.<eos> I'm going to take a nice, hot shower.<eos> - You need to sleep.<eos> - I can't. Too wired.<eos> There is nothing else you can do until the sun goes down.<eos> All right, you want to do something, do it with your son.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> It will do you both good.
Train services have now stopped according to curfew timetables.<eos> Please vacate the stations at your nearest exit.<eos> Wile E. Coyote, eat your heart out.<eos> Meep-meep.<eos> I didn't, I didn't see anything.<eos> I'm telling you, I saw some guy come in here.<eos> I'm positive.<eos> Keep your eyes open.<eos> Hey, you guys!<eos> How you doing tonight?
- What, here?<eos> Just some dirty laundry.<eos> Hey, you guys like movies?<eos> You're gonna spend the night in jail, pal. You know what I hate?<eos> I hate when the, when the good guy is walking away, and then a huge explosion goes off behind him, and he never looks back!<eos> You know, that's not real life!<eos> I mean, me, I'd stop, I'd want to admire my handiwork, you know?<eos> They never cover their ears, either, right?<eos> Put your hands on top of your head now.<eos> I just helped you, okay?
Over here! They're breaching the fence.<eos> Fall back!<eos> Fall back!<eos> CSO1 CSO1...<eos> - CSO1 main.<eos> - I think you're onto something.<eos> Alright. You've got a handle on this.<eos> I'm gonna go help the Professor.<eos> You hold onto Zack.<eos> - He'll be safer with you.
- Get them to the bus.<eos> - Follow me.<eos> - For Chrissake, let me out!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You're gonna wake - up every vampire in this place.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Who the hell's that?<eos> - Mira El Pisaro! - We're all the<eos> - same, man.<eos> I can help you out.
What the...<eos> Come on, keep moving.<eos> Let's go!<eos> We got 'em all.<eos> There's our ride.<eos> I make these calls... not you.<eos> Don't think so.<eos> Thanks for the weapons, but...<eos> Anyone else?<eos> Now, the rest of you can stay here with him or you can get on the bus.
Thanks<eos> - for bringing this to me.<eos> We have one more favour to ask, two travel permits and two tickets to go to D.C.<eos> to get the reacting agent.<eos> Then I'll drop my son off with his grandparents and come back.<eos> Three travel permits and tickets.<eos> Done.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> I want to make sure Zack gets there safely.<eos> Have I told you how much I love you?
Oh, like an outcropping, or a crag?<eos> Sure.<eos> Thank you, Donna Maria.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I still believe the world is good, that bunnies are nice and snakes are mean.<eos> Bunnies can be very mean.<eos> That one day Sandra Bullock will find someone who deserves her, and that Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne will spend the rest of his life in jail, because he is a liar.<eos> The Reverend couldn't lie if he wanted to. His identical twin brother came down from Heaven and told us that.<eos> Then I'll make you a deal.<eos> If you come help us get out of here and the Reverend still goes free, I will join your church and come live with you in the bunker for the rest of my life.
You know, tragedy or not, you girls still have to put food on the table, am I right?<eos> Make a long story short, here's what I'm gonna do for you.<eos> First, I'm gonna make sure your corners are protected.<eos> Corners?<eos> No, no, he doesn't mean corners, like...<eos> Any pimp messes with you on the street, I'm there in a shot.<eos> Who's working on the street?<eos> Condoms, French ticklers, all that shit, free, on me.<eos> Just make me a list.<eos> And the best part, I'm only gonna charge you 40%.
So today I'm a member.<eos> And you better clean that locker room, because if it remains filthy in here, I will fuck with you.<eos> Okay, I'll... I'll take a look.<eos> Damn right, you will.<eos> Shirley's the main part.<eos> They'll give me a trailer and a big hotel room.<eos> And a big car, bigger than yours.<eos> Cool.<eos> My mom and I will get a bunch of money, like millions.<eos> Yeah, I really don't think anyone's giving you millions of dollars.
Doughnuts and coke.<eos> Breakfast of champions.<eos> I got some new thoughts about how we might work together to improve your business. - No. - Not happening.<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> Wait.<eos> Give Mick a chance.<eos> - We did yesterday.<eos> - Why? I get why you ladies might be hesitant.<eos> My ideas yesterday must have struck you as a little bit old-school. - You think?
- We did yesterday.<eos> - Why? I get why you ladies might be hesitant.<eos> My ideas yesterday must have struck you as a little bit old-school. - You think?<eos> - Uh, a little bit.<eos> If you don't want to listen, hey, you're free to go.<eos> But if you stay, I'm gonna let you in on a vision I have of a way we can all get rich together.<eos> Look, this cocaine?<eos> See this cocaine?<eos> This is for you to sell.<eos> Each one of you can take as much as you think you can move.
Just drive the girls.<eos> Have some faith.<eos> You do know I only have one car, okay?<eos> I mean, how am I supposed to drive seven girls around?<eos> Oh, what a delightful dilemma.<eos> Get off of me, Pop. Get off.<eos> Get off.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Mick, one of my regulars is on the way.<eos> Can Audrey stay with you?
I did a terrible thing to you.<eos> Shouldn't have let you take all that heat.<eos> No, no, but you did, because that's who you are.<eos> And then you come round here with a bottle of champagne, and you want me to tell you everything is fine.<eos> Well, it ain't. Things are gonna get better.<eos> You just got to trust it.<eos> No, it's not, Mick.<eos> You know, for me, it's gonna get a lot worse.<eos> And you're going to stick around for that?<eos> You know, I started that business for you kids.
This is business, not cocktail hour.<eos> Mickey, I want you to meet good friend. Old friend. George Markoff.<eos> George has been a bad boy.<eos> I know I'm late, all right, but we have a variable rate mortgage and they jacked it up this month.<eos> You know what it's like.<eos> Not really.<eos> He's three weeks late.<eos> What do you do in Boston if somebody is late?<eos> You work it out.<eos> And what do you do when they pay the bank on time, but not you?
What the fuck are you doing in the hallway?<eos> Avi, you are looking at a man on the way up.<eos> Say what it should say?<eos> Yep, she didn't screw around with you.<eos> This is a sound contract.<eos> You got 3% of the deal.<eos> Paige Finney.<eos> How the fuck did you swing that?<eos> Ezra would have loved this.<eos> Whatever was between you at the end, he knew you could go wherever you wanted and here you are, Mr. Football.
We killed a priest.<eos> Get your stuff.<eos> What are we gonna do about the priest, Ray?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't know?<eos> I don't fucking know, Terry.<eos> I got to think about it.<eos> Right now, I don't know.<eos> Get your stuff.<eos> You tell Abby I appreciate the offer, but I can't move in with you.
Excuse me, everyone, um, it's such a pleasure to have so many new faces here tonight in our home, and we're so happy for both of you, and we know that this is a start of a beautiful family<eos> - All right, slow down.<eos> Sláinte.<eos> Ray?<eos> What?<eos> Fucking say something.<eos> You're the best man.<eos> Bunchy, I love you.<eos> You're my brother.<eos> Um, it's been, you know, uh, a short engagement, but we're all very happy for you.
I need help.<eos> Hasmig!<eos> Hasmig!<eos> Hasmig!<eos> Come on.<eos> - Okay. - Ladies and gentlemen...<eos> - Good. Let's go.<eos> - The one, the only...<eos> Hasmig!<eos> Oh, yes, thank you.
I'll take care of it.<eos> Afternoon, beautiful.<eos> If you're worried about being outed, Mr. Donovan, a family reunion at the station's probably not the play.<eos> My father's done working for you.<eos> Non Compos Mentis declaration approved by the probate court for your records.<eos> For my records?<eos> Who is this little shit?<eos> My lawyer.<eos> Detective, I represent Mickey Donovan as well as his court-appointed guardian, Ray Donovan.<eos> Which one of you assholes paid off Judge Zinn to sign this piece of fiction?
Do you think maybe she was coming back here to talk to me?<eos> I mean, I'm really the only person she ever talked to here.<eos> Well, it's not like I never spoke to her.<eos> No, but I mean about anything important.<eos> What did you talk to her about?<eos> I think I talked to her a little bit about what a good mother you were, about how hard you were trying, how tough it had been for you since you moved here... and talked to her about how close we were.<eos> Do you still like me?<eos> What kind of a silly question is that?<eos> You just seem... different as of late, maybe because Dylan lives here now.<eos> Things have changed between the two of you and between us.
Easy.<eos> Don't start something you're not gonna be able to finish.<eos> He pops me... I still get the shot off.<eos> You're dead.<eos> I'm done.<eos> We're leaving.<eos> That house up there...<eos> Looks like a lot of rooms, good places to hide things... front and back entrance.<eos> Here's a fact.<eos> If I see either one of you here ever again... I'll kill you.
Watch and learn, kids.<eos> Hey, where did everybody go?<eos> One.<eos> Hold it steady, Russ.<eos> Channeling your inner chi will give you the strength to defeat men ten times your size.<eos> The Stinging Dog.<eos> Floats like a butterfly, stings like a bee.<eos> Dogosaurus Rex.<eos> Okay, come on, Russ.<eos> All right. What you lack in size, you make up for with quickness and agility.
What I have to work with is a hormonal 15-year-old girl.<eos> When you were admitted to the academy, I was pregnant.<eos> That's my son.<eos> Our son.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Your birthday's coming up, and we still haven't decided what we're gonna do.<eos> We can have some of your friends over here.<eos> Pastor Tim and his wife?<eos> I kind of wanted to talk to you all about something.
I look at you, well-dressed, well-spoken, and I don't see a nomad thug.<eos> I see a future baron.<eos> If you help me topple Quinn, I'm offering you a territory.<eos> I like what you're preaching, lady, I really do, but if we side with you, we're setting ourselves up to be slaughtered.<eos> You won't be alone.<eos> You and a bunch of girls are gonna help us take down Quinn?<eos> We're done here.<eos> Wait.<eos> The appearance of weakness is the greatest advantage.<eos> If Tilda can take one of you down, you'll accept the terms of my deal.
She started this.<eos> You're the one who antagonized her, Quinn.<eos> If you want the other barons to back down, deal with her.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> Where are all the cogs and the Clippers?<eos> The fields are deserted.<eos> Baron!<eos> - Mari: No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> All right, no one's gonna hurt you.
He doesn't believe in you.<eos> He never has.<eos> I hear your own mother cast you aside as well.<eos> I know what it's like to be rejected and underestimated.<eos> I admired the fact that you came after me.<eos> - It was decisive.<eos> - I came here to meet a real baron.<eos> You want the fort.<eos> Zypher wants Jacobee's.<eos> I'll help you get them.
You let her go.<eos> It looked like you were controlling your power.<eos> I don't know what happened.<eos> - So you got lucky?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Does this mean we get to leave soon?<eos> Quinn wants us to find the Widow.<eos> We leave in an hour.<eos> Quinn and the other barons, they want you to believe they're benevolent because they protect you from the horrors of the world.<eos> I offer you a brighter future, a real future, one you can control.
What is that exactly?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Y-you're coming back to work, right? Here?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> Why are you whispering?<eos> Lisbon, hey.<eos> Someone's trying to reach you?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Hey, boss.<eos> Hi. I'll talk to you guys later, okay?
Oh, my gosh, of course.<eos> We'd love to.<eos> It will take a little child-care juggling, but we can swing it.<eos> You know, worst comes to worst, we'll just bring the little monkeys with us - and keep them locked in the rental car.<eos> - Will not. - I'm kidding.<eos> - Mommy!<eos> No, but seriously, we wouldn't miss it for anything.<eos> I got to go.<eos> We'll see you soon.<eos> All right, I'll send you the details.
And I will handle it without you if I have to.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Okay, I'll do it.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> You will?<eos> Yeah, I said I'll go, and I'll go.<eos> Mr. Paris can see you now.<eos> Bob, this is Norma Bates.<eos> Can I get you guys anything?
Yeah, you're my, uh, brother.<eos> You know, I want to be there for you. We're...<eos> We're a family.<eos> We love each other.<eos> And we'll work through it.<eos> We'll help her work through it.<eos> Hey, I'm home!<eos> I got a chicken.<eos> I'm gonna make a pie.<eos> What's up with you two?
I got you all set up.<eos> Looks like you've got a few messages.<eos> Mm, yeah, I dropped my phone in the mud.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Come on, Norman, let's go. Oh, yes, Mother.<eos> Here I come.<eos> Following after you in a very masculine and attractive way.<eos> Holy crap, Dylan left, like, a hundred messages.<eos> Oh, my Lord.<eos> What was going on with you two?
I got to do it. You know why.<eos> Dylan, Chick is the master of the undersell.<eos> Now, why are you talking about me in the third person<eos> - like I'm not...<eos> - Just a minute. Just hang on.<eos> Look, you're delivering guns, okay?<eos> This is far from risk-free.<eos> Okay, what if this is a setup?<eos> I make this run every month.<eos> I was trying to give you guys an opportunity to make $25,000.
Bye. Hmm.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Yeah, no, almost... Almost done.<eos> It's just, you know, doesn't look much like a pool.<eos> It's... it's a pit, and I don't understand.<eos> Sorry, I... I... I know I haven't been around much the last few days, I...<eos> Hey, do you want to just go to a movie later?<eos> I think we should talk.<eos> You've been through a lot lately.<eos> Uh, I don't know if you know this, but I... I was there with you and Dylan up at the house the night your mom got mad and left.
Yes, he would.<eos> Cute picture, huh?<eos> Where is she?<eos> How would I know that?<eos> I found that picture online somewhere.<eos> It's not the greatest selfie I've ever seen, but there is no accounting for taste.<eos> What do you want, Kellogg?<eos> This is adorable.<eos> The two people I want to speak to most in the world and here they are.<eos> You know, I can't help but feel I had a hand in putting you two back together.
It looks like a pen?<eos> They need it back.<eos> This battle isn't over!<eos> It's hardly begun.<eos> We're only gonna get through this if we trust each other, Kiera.<eos> I trust you.<eos> I trust you, too.<eos> I saw you with her, Brad.<eos> What were you doing with her?<eos> You know, I think back to before all this, before you, and I don't ever see it going back to normal.
Yet worth protecting.<eos> Piron guards.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> Yeah, let's do this.<eos> Ok, remember, you don't have your CMR so your suit only has it's minimal functions.<eos> Body armour, electro-taser, active camouflage.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Alec, we've got a problem.<eos> Yeah, you sure do.<eos> I got bad news. Looks like our friends have been expecting you.
Selfish bitch.<eos> It has nothing to do with Brad, don't you see?<eos> We could all go home.<eos> Newsflash, you're the only one who wants to go back.<eos> Lucas died trying to prevent that shitty future.<eos> You're spitting in his face wanting to preserve it.<eos> Pull over.<eos> Not until we're clear.<eos> Pull over.<eos> I don't know if you grunts are aware but moving from this site has never been an option.
We're supposed to have each other's back.<eos> I didn't even know you wanted to leave until circumstances forced you to tell me.<eos> Until I could be sure.<eos> Also, my choice.<eos> Yeah, well, your choices?<eos> They have an impact on the people in your life.<eos> You need to take responsibility, not just for yourself.<eos> I have honoured my responsibility to others.<eos> This department, this city. Dillon, you, Alec.<eos> I have done right by all of you.
Is her apartment missing a rug?<eos> Hardwood floor is no way to know.<eos> If it was easy, anybody could do it.<eos> - Holiday.<eos> - Rizzoli.<eos> Sounds like something your mom would serve for dinner.<eos> "Kids, come to the table.<eos> The holiday Rizzoli is ready."<eos> - You don't know many Italians, do you?<eos> - Just you guys.
He's got to ask, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> [Siren wailing]<eos> - If we can't find that gun, I'm screwed.<eos> - Listen to me, okay?<eos> Korsak and I are going to talk to the witnesses.<eos> All right? We'll look at the security video.<eos> How long before IAD gets here, huh, 10 minutes?<eos> - They're not gonna let you do anything.
I just can't believe he kept it secret.<eos> I can't believe how much I'm starting to like this chair. - Oh.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Ooh! Did you bring dinner?<eos> I'm starving!<eos> No.<eos> I hope better.<eos> I was, uh... well, I guess I was scared, and, uh, I wanted to show you all how much I ...
- I mean, uh, I really appreciate what ...<eos> I know how hard you worked to ...<eos> You got me a signed Ted Williams baseball?<eos> Whaaat?<eos> That is amazing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - That's what I was trying to say.<eos> - We made you a drink.<eos> It's right there next to that beautiful side-by-side fridge you didn't tell us about.<eos> I was gonna tell you.
- Anyway, good night.<eos> - Oh, Kent, uh, a few of us are going to the Dirty Robber after work ... just a small celebration of Susie's life.<eos> Why don't you come?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I'd like that.<eos> I think this is yours.<eos> I was wondering where that got to.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Uh, I'll see you shortly.<eos> Thank you all for coming.
Of course he was.<eos> Okay, we're gonna have to tape down all the rugs.<eos> Hi.<eos> Ma, did you give Cousin Carlo Maura's number?<eos> - I would never.<eos> - Well, he's coming here... tonight.<eos> I have to say, he's upped his game a little bit.<eos> Okay, uh, I'm gonna get rubber mats - for all these slippery hardwood floors.<eos> - Okay, wait a minute.<eos> Have either one of you ever actually seen him fall?
Yeah, I'd like to play more, but had to give up the dream in order to survive.<eos> Oh, god, I'm so sorry I'm late.<eos> Angela, sweetheart!<eos> You look fantastic.<eos> - Come here.<eos> Come here. - Aw.<eos> Nice to see you, Carlo.<eos> Yeah, yeah, you too, honey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I will leave the two of you to catch up.
- Had an I.D. - Ah!<eos> People are nuts.<eos> Yeah. When's your interview with the condo board?<eos> Oh, as soon as I'm done here.<eos> As soon as Maura rules this as an accident.<eos> She drown?<eos> - I can't say definitely.<eos> - What about time of death?<eos> Water makes that assessment difficult.<eos> The one thing I can tell you is that she appears to have been attacked by her dog. - Ugh.
- It's okay.<eos> And look, I appreciate you letting me stay with you.<eos> I know it's a pain, but hey, I'll be out soon.<eos> No, I've liked having you around, but we both need our privacy, right? Hey.<eos> How did it go with the condo?<eos> - Was it good?<eos> - Not yet. - But I think it's gonna be.<eos> - I can't believe it.<eos> What?<eos> Your mom said that if I told her what was going on with you guys, she'd know how to get you talking.
- What hotel?<eos> - Where he worked.<eos> For a guy named Alphonse.<eos> We don't have any record of him at a hotel.<eos> It wasn't that kind of job.<eos> Okay, primer.<eos> What do you want us to know?<eos> Yeah, all I know is cardiologist, patriots fan,<eos> - daughter Joann.<eos> - And I'm not telling you anything.
And what about other inmates?<eos> No, Lianne stayed mostly to herself.<eos> She had been here before.<eos> She was determined never to come back again.<eos> Uh, one more thing.<eos> Did she ever mention a Detective Rizzoli? No.<eos> But why would she mention you?<eos> - No reason.<eos> Thanks for your time.<eos> Thank you all for your cooperation.
Salem, as in the salem witch trials?<eos> His family came to massachusetts During the great puritan migration.<eos> He grew up a spiritual man, A pillar of the community, beloved by all.<eos> Times were hard back then, But the town was close-knit.<eos> Everyone pulled together, no matter their background.<eos> Why, thank you, mrs.<eos> Parsons. I don't know the next time We'll have fresh bread,<eos> Especially if this drought lingers.<eos> As providence decrees.<eos> Peace be upon you.

Not my favorite, honestly, on a technical level.<eos> How come you stopped writing?<eos> People stopped reading.<eos> - Here, just...<eos> - Oh, no, dear.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - I feel like it's swelling...<eos> - I've had ice. I really have.<eos> And I think it's done what it can do.<eos> I'm gonna give you your privacy.
I got your back. Actually, I have all your backs, all right?<eos> Uh, since I can't drink tonight, I am your designated buddy.<eos> Here in my backpack, I have a list of items that we may need.<eos> I got water, so...<eos> - I got towels for everybody.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> I got... small stick.<eos> - Speaks for itself.<eos> - Oh. Oh. Also... one female condom.<eos> It's gonna go quick, so I'll let you two fight it out. Uh-uh.
That's... Because I'm gonna out-drink Miller.<eos> You are gonna out-drink Miller?<eos> No one out-drinks Miller.<eos> - I do.<eos> - I guarantee you, you don't.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Cece, Nick just got dumped, okay?<eos> He has a depth of anger and sadness that rests between his eyes, and he can drink forever and ever and ever.<eos> You'll lose every time.<eos> Hey, it's my business partner that I was telling you about... Schmidt!
I got something just for that.<eos> You're gonna love it.<eos> Here it is.<eos> - I can't wait.<eos> - Give it to me right...<eos> - Go get that girl, dude.<eos> I don't even know where she is.<eos> I didn't hit you that hard.<eos> This, uh, Schmidt's jacket you're wearing? Yeah.<eos> Not to be a nosy buddy, but sparks are flying like the Wright brothers between you two.
Until not so much.<eos> We were gonna lose, so I made a deal with the wizard... of Oz.<eos> Wears a hood and a creepy mask, kind of a jerk ...<eos> good times. He said for us to win, I had to unleash my true darkness, which he meant literally.<eos> He used the inner key of Oz.<eos> It opens a door to your soul and lets the darkness out.<eos> Uh, we're still connected physically.<eos> If you hurt her, you hurt me.<eos> But bottom line, she's bad, and I'm good.<eos> And let me just tell you, being good is really annoying.
All right.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Are you gonna stare at that all night?<eos> I'm pacing myself.<eos> She's cute.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> You lied to yourself.<eos> That's kind of your move.<eos> Something's off about you, though, isn't it?<eos> It's always something with you boys.
Convenient she's coming forward now, isn't it?<eos> Condé is a good patriot, who's helped the Crown.<eos> I struggle to see him as dangerous.<eos> I understand your reluctance, but the matter is easily settled.<eos> My men will bring Prince Condé in, and we will see if he has the brand or not.<eos> If he does, he'll hang.<eos> To the carriage at once.<eos> Your Grace, as the new Captain of the Royal Escort, I am charged with providing your protection to Chambord.<eos> Chambord can wait.<eos> Besides you, the only other person who saw the brand was a woman named Josephine.
Whom you slept with?<eos> After you'd been branded?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, why are you taking your spurs?<eos> My horse is...<eos> No, forget your horse.<eos> You'll be arrested before you've gone half a mile.<eos> You'll travel in my carriage...<eos> I will take you to Chambord.<eos> Your home in Condé is the first place they'll look for you.
Yes.<eos> See, when they decide to take her, it won't be quick.<eos> You'll wish you'd done it yourself, and sooner.<eos> Ah, Kenna.<eos> With death comes wisdom.<eos> What did I ever see in her?<eos> Well, it was her ass.<eos> You mentioned it many times.<eos> Are you talking to me?<eos> Why would I talk to you?
She lives for her children, no matter how she argues with them.<eos> If you think Claude's in danger, do what I do.<eos> Challenge Catherine to a duel?<eos> Gather evidence.<eos> Test your theory.<eos> Mary, Queen of France and Scotland.<eos> Prince Louis of Condé and Lady Castleroy.<eos> Brother, what a delightful surprise.<eos> Now, Queen Mary, it is a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance.<eos> Louis speaks very highly of you.

Francis, you know that.<eos> There must be some way to at least loosen their grip.<eos> When Mary returns, I don't want her to see me cowed and powerless, pretending that I am blind to injustice.<eos> I want her to see the man and the king she thought she married.<eos> Cardinal Perazzo claims the brand is the infallible sign of a Protestant traitor.<eos> But I wonder how he'd explain it if a loyal Catholic were branded.<eos> I sent a page to your quarters.<eos> He said you weren't receiving messages.<eos> I was preparing for the party.<eos> That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
And once she falls, the rest will follow.<eos> Mary has no romantic feelings for me.<eos> - You never changed a woman's mind before?<eos> - It's not possible.<eos> This is not even close to the right time.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Look.<eos> I'm just not interested in her.<eos> To be honest, she's a bit prudish for my tastes.<eos> I heard you were ill, so I put together some of the finest cheeses and croissants to help you feel better.

There's only one rung above cardinal.<eos> Your dreams do reach high.<eos> I'll be sure I'm not seen.<eos> For my next selection, the lovely<eos> Lady Atley... and the Prince of Condé.<eos> Another of your games?<eos> Well, you told me you that weren't interested in Mary.<eos> Not that you'd given up living.<eos> Or is it that only one woman could satisfy?<eos> I hope this isn't unwelcome to you.

Try the brie.<eos> It's delicious.<eos> Why am I your patient?<eos> Are you a healer?<eos> No.<eos> Did I ask for your help?<eos> No.<eos> My mother's taking perfectly good care of me.<eos> You are so foolish!<eos> Catherine is poisoning you, and I'm trying to save your life!
No.<eos> My mother's taking perfectly good care of me.<eos> You are so foolish!<eos> Catherine is poisoning you, and I'm trying to save your life!<eos> What?<eos> How dare you suggest...<eos> Think about it.<eos> Catherine's soup... when did you first eat it?<eos> When did you first start feeling ill?<eos> And how have you felt since I took it away from you?

Will you really go back to French court<eos> - when you leave Chambord?<eos> - Where else would I go?<eos> Have you considered Scotland?<eos> You might be safer there than France.<eos> There is unrest in both countries.<eos> But here you have a husband whose decisions endanger you.<eos> I'm sorry, but it's true.<eos> If it is true or not, it is for me to deal with.<eos> There are things you don't know about my marriage, things I will not share with you.
There are things you don't know about my marriage, things I will not share with you.<eos> I admire your loyalty, but...<eos> You have no idea what Francis' intentions are, or how he's suffering because of what happened.<eos> But beyond that, I don't trust your motives in this advice.<eos> I read your letter.<eos> - Oh, you never said...<eos> - Because I know that you tried to get that letter back.<eos> One of the servants you sent to retrieve it told me so.<eos> You wished that letter had never been sent, and I respected your wishes.<eos> I wrote that letter thinking I'd never see you again.
The brand is what brought them here.<eos> We'll have to get rid of it.<eos> Burn if off?<eos> They won't be fooled.<eos> They'll know what we did<eos> - or at least suspect it.<eos> - They will.<eos> But all we need is enough doubt to prevent a hanging.<eos> With that, and with my support, we may convince them to arrest you and take you back to court, where Francis can help.<eos> Ordinarily, I wouldn't tell you this, knowing your feelings.
Once it's done, all the tombs in this area will be found.<eos> Ouch!<eos> What do you want young lady?<eos> Show me your gills.<eos> Yo!<eos> Leave him alone!<eos> From now on, I will pull one tooth out every time you get it wrong till you find get it right.<eos> If there's nothing found by dawn, I shall execute the breaching of terms.<eos> What breaching of terms?<eos> One hole for each of you.
Interesting.<eos> She has double identities:<eos> a royal blood and shaman, worshipped as a Goddess,<eos> The Equinox flower is her instrument.<eos> Legends tell the flower opens the gate to the underworld.<eos> It brings the dead back to life.<eos> This guy is too drunk to drive.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> The locals are all like this the more they drink the better they drive.<eos> A little bit more, I can take you both high up to the sky.
This is the comradeship of revolution.<eos> Please go ahead if you wanna leave.<eos> Alright.<eos> I go with you for the Equinox flower.<eos> Let them wait for us here.<eos> No joking?<eos> NQ joking.<eos> I knew that you weren't an irresponsible man.<eos> Real men live for loyalty and honesty.<eos> Don't you guys worry about Miss Yang.
Let me go!<eos> Let g0!<eos> You shouldn't have saved me at all.<eos> So that Ding and I could be together forever and no need to suffer for living.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> Don't you feel shameful living a life like this!<eos> Forgetting is betraying<eos> Ding Sitian is already died.<eos> I can't lose you and Shirley.<eos> I have to take you both out of here for whatever it takes.
Jerks! Wankers! Assholes!<eos> Have you got fuckin'enough You fuckers!<eos> I don't give a fuckin' shit about your relationships.<eos> Don't waste my fuckin' time!<eos> Calm down. Lady.<eos> My compass is broken so I can't use the 'dragon seeking' now.<eos> The world's going to be destroyed anyway.<eos> I don't mind destroying this one first.<eos> Lady, I have an idea.<eos> I've taken you get out of the traps. You should trust me.
No!<eos> All fools are rich!<eos> So... so, you take...<eos> What's that?<eos> No!<eos> - Mommy!<eos> - That's Seth.<eos> Is that Seth? That's Seth, isn't it? Mommy!<eos> He's sick, isn't he?<eos> - They tampered with you. - Shut up!
That's enough.<eos> Just getting to know the enemy, Major.<eos> You have an assignment. I will brief you so this time you don't stray. Sir.<eos> Dirty Paul.<eos> He lies with my sestras.<eos> Even Rachel.<eos> Come inside. Have another.<eos> You won't believe me, but...<eos> I am sorry it has come to this.<eos> Hmm. One day, I kill you all.
And you must be Gracie.<eos> I know you've probably heard many frightening things about this place.<eos> A rare instance of Prolethean wisdom.<eos> But I can assure you that we are here to help.<eos> But you already did tests at Mrs. S's house.<eos> Trust me, I know how much this sucks, but we've got some amazing technology here that's, um, gonna help us learn more, okay?<eos> Uh, this is Scott.<eos> Gracie.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Ladies, we're gonna give you a bit of privacy.
The original?<eos> What's that, the Castor Original?<eos> Maybe.<eos> H-4-6 2-3-9?<eos> - Sarah, the code. - Shit.<eos> Not wise, Mrs. Sadler.<eos> It's quite the sight you two make.<eos> Thank you, Rachel.<eos> You... filthy...<eos> I'm sorry to raise any false hopes, but Delphine knew you had a copy.
Right?<eos> He is Felix.<eos> We belong to Mrs. S. To Siobhan.<eos> We're her foster kids.<eos> Sarah Manning?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> You know me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had to track you down 20-odd years back or so.<eos> I moved you about from place to place.
None of her people are visible.<eos> Except for one.<eos> Who do you think it is?<eos> The soccer mom.<eos> I am so thrilled to be here on this sunny election day.<eos> And I challenge us all to think of our children today.<eos> And vote for Hendrix for inclusion.<eos> Can I get a little neighbourly love for Bailey Downs?<eos> Thank you, Maggie.<eos> Thank you, Gavin.
Always a true pleasure to be sitting with the most beautiful lady in town.<eos> - I nearly swallowed a nut.<eos> - What would happen?<eos> Oh, no pretty sight!<eos> - Are you allergic to nuts?<eos> - Yes, indeed!<eos> - Ms. Wandbeck loves drama.<eos> - A terrible lady.<eos> Welcome, my little bees!<eos> I wish you a wonderful, terrific... afternoon with the lucky balls... that make a fortune!
Rico! Oskar!<eos> What are you doing out here? Where are you going?<eos> - We're helping Mum and Mr. Van Scherten!<eos> - Who?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Frederico!<eos> You can't stop us. It's a question of life or death! What?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> To the "mousetrap", please!<eos> I'm not gonna let you drive around Berlin in the middle of the night!
Man fall over in the "Mousetrap".<eos> We need "nee-naw-engine" here!<eos> Thanks.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> You take care of him.<eos> I'll close up the club. It's useless anyway.<eos> - Ok.<eos> Ms. Dahling!<eos> - Boys. I am so happy you're well!
Good ol' Mr. Van Scherten. You really made us jump!<eos> - Rico and Oskar are still inside. - What?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Take these handcuffs off.<eos> Now, you filthy little rats!<eos> - That was very brave of you!<eos> - And very clever of you!<eos> Rico! Oskar!<eos> Don't worry, I'm here!<eos> Are you ok?
- Me?<eos> - Forget it.<eos> These are Boris' keys.<eos> This key is for the barn, in which the stolen goods are hidden.<eos> I wrote directions and a list of all the stolen goods.<eos> Looks like you've done a good job!<eos> Listen, son, we need to talk.<eos> But we'll do that at home, ok?<eos> And us, too, Simon.<eos> - Simon? - I'll take you home.
I especially don't want Royalle talking to Wolfe.<eos> Sooner or later, Royalle's lawyers are gonna get him in there.<eos> So, do something to fuck him up.<eos> What?<eos> Do something to keep him at bay.<eos> We're supposed to be talking about the launch of my foundation.<eos> Whose mission is to transform young girls into leaders.<eos> Why not bring Zora on as the foundation's first mentor?<eos> Zora would love that.<eos> We put the two of you out there, looking like a team, talking about sharing your experiences with the next generation.
A pony?<eos> Yeah! All right.<eos> Here you go, here we go.<eos> She's a superstar.<eos> She's just a kid herself.<eos> Speaking of which...<eos> Uh, everything is set.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - So, what does she know?<eos> - Yeah, you like that?
I will stand aside, and I will let her have her moment, but you are fired.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You still need me.<eos> Not if I don't play the game.<eos> What, are you just gonna... just gonna walk away?<eos> Watch me.<eos> Sorry, Mom.<eos> Krisp... Krisp?<eos> get back on your knees, babe i'm gonna make you...<eos> I'm here to show you that in the world of Powers, there's no limit to their hypocrisy.
We saved your ass from making another huge mistake.<eos> I'd rather not have blood on myself anymore.<eos> Mine or yours.<eos> Gracious of you.<eos> And...<eos> I could kill you.<eos> Finally lick the plate clean.<eos> But there doesn't seem to be anything left to lick.<eos> Christian, get Johnny.<eos> I want to talk to you boys.
Tremendous pleasure and honor to welcome the incredible, unique, and fantastic, one and only Nina Simone.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi!<eos> We're ready.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> I haven't seen you for many years, since 1968.<eos> I have decided that I will do no more jazz festivals.<eos> That decision has not changed.<eos> I will sing for you, or we will do and share with you a few moments,<eos> after which I shall graduate to a higher class, I hope, and I hope you will come with me.
When I first got into show business, I wasn't a blues singer and I wasn't even a jazz singer.<eos> I was a classical pianist.<eos> I studied to become the first black classical pianist in America, and that's all that was on my mind.<eos> That's what I was prepared to be.<eos> I was born Eunice Waymon, which is my real name, by the way, in a town called Tryon, North Carolina.<eos> I started to play the piano when I was three or four.<eos> My mother was a preacher and she took me with her on her revivals, and I started to play the piano in church.<eos> ♪ Children go where I send you ♪<eos> ♪ How shall I send you? ♪<eos> ♪ I'm gonna send you one by one ♪
Now I could sing to help my people, and that became the mainstay of my life.<eos> Not classical piano, not classical music, not even popular music, but civil rights music.<eos> I got to know Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Andrew Young, and artists, actors, actresses, poets, writers, people like myself who felt compelled to make the stand that I have.<eos> It was very important for her to connect with the writers and playwrights of that moment because those people had the intellectual background of the movement and she didn't have that.<eos> She had music, the musical background.<eos> For instance, Langston Hughes, he wrote the lyrics for "Backlash Blues" for her.<eos> Lorraine Hansberry, Nina took her play, Young, Gifted, and Black, and made a song out of it.<eos> It's regarded as one of the most important songs in the civil rights movement.<eos> I know that there are only 300 black students here in this college of 18,000.<eos> So this song is dedicated only to you.
You don't have to be."<eos> I was never non-violent.<eos> Never.<eos> I thought we should get our rights by any means necessary.<eos> And then she met Stokely Carmichael.<eos> Miss Simone says something very significant in her song "Mississippi Goddam."<eos> She says, "This country..." She says, "This country is built on lies."<eos> You're gonna sit in front of your television set and listen to LBJ tell you that,<eos> "Violence never accomplishes anything, my fellow Americans."<eos> And the honky drafting you out of school to go fight in Vietnam.
We had yesterday to learn it, and... so we'll see.<eos> ♪ Once upon this planet Earth ♪<eos> ♪ Lived a man of humble birth ♪<eos> ♪ Preaching love and freedom ♪<eos> ♪ For his fellow man ♪<eos> ♪ He was dreaming of the day ♪<eos> ♪ Peace would come to Earth to stay ♪<eos> Last year, Lorraine Hansberry left us, and she was a dear friend, and then Langston Hughes left us.<eos> Who can go on?<eos> Do you realize how many we have lost?
On the other hand, she was very well aware that in Africa, no money came in.<eos> So she had to pick up her career again.<eos> She didn't want to return to what she called,<eos> "The United Snakes of America."<eos> So she moved to Switzerland, which was the complete opposite of Africa, and the first thing she did was the Montreux concert.<eos> You on yet?<eos> Do you hear all those noises?<eos> You didn't forget me, huh?<eos> That's- - That's what's so wild, you didn't forget me.<eos> I didn't expect you to, but I'm tired.
That's- - That's what's so wild, you didn't forget me.<eos> I didn't expect you to, but I'm tired.<eos> You don't know what I mean.<eos> And there are many people in show business who said,<eos> "Oh, she- - You know, she used to be a star.<eos> She's gone all the way to the bottom,"<eos> and all kinds of crap which means nothing to me at all.<eos> I hope that you will see me or see the spirit in another sphere, on another plane very soon now.<eos> And again, I don't wanna let you down and I get this feeling.<eos> So I think the only way to tell you who I am these days... is to sing a song by Janis Ian.
Take this, all of you, and drink from it. For this is the chalice of my blood.<eos> Please!<eos> I beg you!
- Burke's dead, isn't he?<eos> We have new evidence to present.<eos> There is one proviso, however.<eos> That mouthpiece from Anneca, the one you spoke to?<eos> Bring him along.<eos> Wait, wait. We can't leave.<eos> Kushan's doubled the guards outside.<eos> It's too risky.<eos> I may need to have a chat with this Commander Kushan.<eos> We'll come to you.
They just said that something had happened and she had to come back to Rosewood.<eos> Did you know Mona a long time?<eos> We met a couple of summers ago, at her grandparents' place.<eos> I don't remember seeing you at the memorial service.<eos> I had exams and a professor who won't reschedule for anyone or anything.<eos> But you're here now.<eos> Just for the weekend.<eos> With that awful girl's trial coming up, Mrs. Vanderwaal needs all the support she can get.<eos> You girls were there for Mona and her mom, and I wasn't.<eos> I want to thank you for that.
You forgot a parent's signature.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> I must've missed that.<eos> My mom is visiting my dad at his base.<eos> Can she fax her permission?<eos> Sure, no problem.<eos> What's this?<eos> Oh, the event's calendar.<eos> Meet and greet, pancake breakfast, orientation.<eos> Each one of you is also assigned a fairy godmother to help you walk through it.

I brought you some magazines.<eos> But they took them.<eos> Yeah, um... You have to go through the canteen.<eos> Yeah, they told me.<eos> I'll do that.<eos> Ali, I've been thinking about what I said to you.<eos> Hanna, please don't apologize.<eos> When I first got here, I kept thinking, "How did this happen?<eos> What did I do to deserve this?"<eos> I honestly thought that I was helping you guys.
Previously on Pretty Little Liars...<eos> What are those?<eos> Ali was talking to somebody through the personal ads.<eos> People turn on the microphone and anonymously record any secret they want to with the understanding that a stranger is gonna sit at this table and listen to a random whisper.<eos> Tanner saw both of us there.<eos> After she takes me down, she can go after you too, and it will be all my fault.<eos> Ashley, will you marry me?<eos> Andrew?<eos> Is there something going on between you two?
You know, we call it and it just rings, no pick up, no voice mail, nothing.<eos> Yeah, and meanwhile Neilan's Law Office is closed and locked.<eos> But the number appearing twice...<eos> It's got to mean something, we just have to figure it out.<eos> What if we don't figure it out in time?<eos> The three of you are gonna be late for school.<eos> Uh, no, Mom, teacher's conference.<eos> They dropped the first two periods.<eos> I told you.<eos> Oh, then, uh, this is my chance to talk to all of you.

I heard.<eos> Too late to do anything about it.<eos> Too late to do anything except to warn me not to be there?<eos> Maybe now you understand why I did that.<eos> I'm still trying to understand why you and Melissa lied to me and tried to keep me from coming back when my friends needed me?<eos> Someone will be going to prison for a very long time.<eos> My only concern is that it's not going to be you.<eos> Don't you want to ask me if I knew about Ali's fake kidnapping?<eos> Because I'm telling you, you didn't.<eos> All that time she was talking to somebody about her mother, she never told you?
What can I get for you?<eos> Actually, I'm looking for someone, Hanna Marin.<eos> Why are you looking for Hanna Marin?<eos> My name is Lesli.<eos> I was a friend of Mona's.<eos> Mrs. Van der Wall said you were trying to find me.<eos> Not just you;<eos> the others.<eos> You girls were there for Mona,<eos> I wasn't. I want to thank you for that.
Will you drink tomato juice?<eos> Whatever. I don't care.<eos> Actually, you might.<eos> This could be sauce.<eos> That girl will never talk to us.<eos> And if Aria's mom won't help us, we have to ask Toby.<eos> He's a policeman, Spencer.<eos> And if Kendra's such a good girl, she's not gonna lie to someone wearing that uniform.<eos> Just please forget about Toby.<eos> What happened between you two in that stairwell?
Can you fucking believe that?<eos> It does strain credulity.<eos> Now, either I've discovered a tear in the space-time continuum or... ..it's gotta be Spivak's old man, right?<eos> Dead ringer.<eos> So I gave Roman this big pile of nothing to chew on. Hope it's enough to keep him paying out.<eos> But I don't know. It seems mighty thin.<eos> I, uh... ..I think it's time I told you the truth about my son.<eos> The Vikings, right?<eos> Terror of the northern seas, axes dripping with blood, villages burned to the ground, rape.<eos> Oh, if you two ever fell into their clutches, I shudder to think what they'd do to you, great horned devils.
It'll be a bloodbath, and you know it.<eos> How many would have to die, all of them, all of us?<eos> As many as it takes.<eos> If we fight, then we die.<eos> Just...<eos> The time for diplomacy is over, Marcus.<eos> Now either you lead us into battle or get the hell out of my way.<eos> Thelonious just... just stop.<eos> Stop. Just listen to me, I'm begging you.<eos> You found this place when nobody else believed you.
When to eat, where to sleep, how to live.<eos> The unrest will turn to violence.<eos> I've seen it before.<eos> You need to lead them.<eos> That's what my brother said.<eos> Indra, I'm not a Commander.<eos> The time of the Commanders is past.<eos> The time of the Flame is past.<eos> This is your time.<eos> Let me help you.
You suck at talking people into things.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Anyone here still need to be talked into this?<eos> Good. Now we know the many ways we might die today, why don't you tell us what we have to do to live?<eos> How much further to the lighthouse?<eos> Oh, so you can talk.<eos> I wondered.<eos> It's right through these trees, sunshine.<eos> What's your problem with me, anyway?<eos> What did I ever do to you?
A.L.I.E. was right about that.<eos> Our fight is not over.<eos> My mom had a vision of me dying, just like the one Raven had that told her there was a rocket here.<eos> It is not the same thing.<eos> Yeah. They were both EMP'd.<eos> And Abby will be fine, too.<eos> Raven told her how to stop it.<eos> That's not what I'm talking about.<eos> If anything happens to me...<eos> Nothing is happening to you.
Nothing is happening to you.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> Let's run these water numbers again.<eos> Please, Bellamy, I need you to hear this.<eos> We've been through a lot together, you and I.<eos> I didn't like you at first... That's no secret...<eos> But even then, every stupid thing you did, it was to protect your sister.<eos> She didn't always see that, but I did.<eos> You've got such a big heart, Bellamy. Clarke...<eos> People follow you.
Dish aligned.<eos> Dish aligned.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> 15%.<eos> There's 10 minutes of air left.<eos> 17%.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> At least I don't have to watch you die.
Home, sweet home, huh?<eos> There's an access panel down at the end of the hallway.<eos> Oxygen level... Critical.<eos> She's out of oxygen.<eos> What do we do?<eos> We share.<eos> Put her down near the vents.<eos> It's where the air will arrive first.<eos> Monty, know where this goes?<eos> I'll have to talk you through it.
-Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I'm actually really good.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> I just feel like you've been going through hell and I just don't want to screw up my end of the bargain.<eos> I'm just a little nervous about that.<eos> -Because it was weird in there.<eos> -Okay.<eos> It was a little bit strange. It seemed like it was about something else.<eos> I promise you that it is not, okay?
I am so sorry.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I think it was the lotion and...<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> There's gotta be some left in there.<eos> No, look, there's a little residue, but there's no...<eos> -On both sides, it's messed up.<eos> -We can get it off.<eos> It's nothing but glass. It's contaminated.<eos> I can't inject you with glass.
-You can and you will.<eos> -I will not inject you with glass.<eos> We're not having a glass baby.<eos> -Do you have any extra?<eos> -No! Each vial costs hundreds of dollars!<eos> God damn it, the whole procedure cost $30,000.<eos> It would've been nice to have a backup or something.<eos> Are you seriously blaming me for not anticipating you dropping the vial?<eos> Look, you know that I drop shit.<eos> Of course I'm not blaming you.
I'm trying to hear it.<eos> Lisa, it's Dr... -Tell me who it is!<eos> -It's Dr. Trevino.<eos> He's saying to call in the morning to reschedule the retrieval.<eos> -No!<eos> -That's what he's saying.<eos> He doesn't understand.<eos> We need to do it now!<eos> -Please don't offer to suck Felix's dick.<eos> -I can't do anything right. You're mad if I do, you're mad if I don't.
Did you do that on purpose? I didn't...<eos> You know what?<eos> No.<eos> You used to be on board with having a child and now it doesn't seem like you want to do that.<eos> Can you just be honest with me?<eos> Be honest with me!<eos> -Do you want to have a child?<eos> -I don't know!<eos> I don't know.<eos> But you do, and I love you, and I want you to get what you want.

-Okay.<eos> -Thank you so much.<eos> -Boy... -Thank you.<eos> Okay, that seemed inappropriate.<eos> Babe, that doctor...<eos> I'm a little worried he's going to get up there and he's just going to...<eos> poke around at other stuff. -He seems really pissed off at us.<eos> -No, baby. He won't do that.<eos> He's a professional.<eos> I promise you it won't happen.
-I'll jizz it out.<eos> Hey, you want a dick pic?<eos> No, because if it's you, baby, it's not a dick pic.<eos> -You know what I mean.<eos> Give it here.<eos> Here we go. Oh, yeah.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> -There you go.<eos> -That's gonna do the trick.<eos> That's the one, babe. Thank you.
You can't go that hard in the beginning.<eos> You know? You can do that in the woods with a couple of drinking buddies.<eos> Freaking people out. "Hey, Matt, relax.<eos> There's girls here. Jesus Christ."<eos> "I think I've got a shot here.<eos> I'm trying to get laid. Can you just be a wingman?<eos> For once in your life, dude, can you just be a... Just bring the energy down.<eos> Nobody gives a fuck about your fucking theories, okay?<eos> Just be a chill guy. You've got shit on your mouth.<eos> Either grow a moustache or don't. You look ridiculous.
"Michael Jackson, I've got to fucking see that."<eos> But if somebody woke you up, like,<eos> "Dude, you've got to see this guy!<eos> He's the next Hootie The Blowfish!" Right? You'd smash him over the head with your fucking lantern, or whatever you've got.<eos> Why don't his fucking kills count?<eos> Dude, Stalin, he even killed his own friends.<eos> Hitler didn't even do that.<eos> You go duck hunting with Stalin.<eos> You thought you were in with him.<eos> He's taking pictures with you and shit.
We'll throw 'em and distract 'em, and then we'll climb out just using our arms."<eos> You literally just have to sit there, going, like, "Okay.<eos> Uh... Not... Not trying to be a dick, but...<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No disrespect to you. Okay?"<eos> "But I'm gonna go to Big Tall.<eos> I'm gonna get a jacket, a hat, and some fucked-up-looking shoes.<eos> Okay?<eos> And what I need from you...

Just put it together.<eos> Grab two slices of pre-made, pre-sliced bread, two handfuls of pre-murdered meat.<eos> Put a little mustard on it.<eos> Grab a beer, walk out, just hand it to him, don't say shit, and then fucking leave.<eos> When I say leave, I mean leave.<eos> I don't mean walk into another room for, like, ten minutes and then stick your head back and be like,<eos> "Did you like it? Was it good?<eos> Great, because downstairs we need to...<eos> Don't yell at me!<eos> I just made you a sandwich!"
Breathe.<eos> Breathe, Helena.<eos> That alarm is our people.<eos> Okay?<eos> So they tracked me here.<eos> We're not alone.<eos> There you go. - Shh, shh.<eos> - I need water.<eos> Water?<eos> Okay, I'll find you some.
You've never even taken responsibility for yourself, Sarah.<eos> How are you gonna be responsible for two?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You said it was my choice, didn't you?<eos> Yes, but your choice does not a mother make.<eos> You need to show me you can be still.<eos> And I will be here for you.<eos> I will support you, whatever it takes.<eos> I don't need your support.<eos> I don't need nothing from you.
- Yeah. - Hello.<eos> I think I sense a hand-off.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yeah, take him.<eos> You're gonna do fine, just lift up.<eos> It's just a human.<eos> - Oh, a human. - You okay?<eos> - No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.
I think I sense a hand-off.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yeah, take him.<eos> You're gonna do fine, just lift up.<eos> It's just a human.<eos> - Oh, a human. - You okay?<eos> - No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> I don't wanna hurt you.
- Hey, she made it.<eos> How was the test?<eos> - Good. - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It was good.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, leave her alone, you guys.<eos> Got something afoot, Felix?<eos> Colin, I've told you that you've got to stop being so perceptive.
Okay, leave her alone, you guys.<eos> Got something afoot, Felix?<eos> Colin, I've told you that you've got to stop being so perceptive.<eos> Remember?<eos> I'm expecting someone. - On the down low.<eos> - I see.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you?
Yeah.<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Hey.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He is very strong.<eos> Well, you're strong just like your mom.<eos> - Uh-oh. - Oh, my goodness.<eos> How are you?
Yeah, I get that, too.<eos> Oh, are these the old toys you cleaned out of the house?<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - Oh, thank God.<eos> Do you know what Helena gives the twins for toys?<eos> Rocks.<eos> - No. - Yeah, no it's true.<eos> I, um... I had to take them away.<eos> Christ, serious?<eos> Thank God. She needs a little guidance, so...<eos> If you're not too busy, now that you're done your test, it would be nice to see you a little more often. Yeah?
- No. - Yeah, no it's true.<eos> I, um... I had to take them away.<eos> Christ, serious?<eos> Thank God. She needs a little guidance, so...<eos> If you're not too busy, now that you're done your test, it would be nice to see you a little more often. Yeah?<eos> Yeah, where is Meathead?<eos> Uh, she's putting the boys to bed.<eos> Hey.<eos> You good?<eos> - How you doing, sestra?
We just need a change.<eos> Freedom looks different to everyone.<eos> Honey, we feel your loss.<eos> But Kira has cousins now.<eos> She has a stable home...<eos> In the house where her grandmother was shot dead!<eos> Alison, take a bloody cue for once!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Is it cool if I chill with you?
Isn't this enough?<eos> - Hey. Hey, hey, hey, Sarah.<eos> Good morning, Cal.<eos> It's Lisa Jackson.<eos> I'm so sorry to be calling with, uh, not-so-good news.<eos> But I'll go ahead and just rip off the Band-Aid.<eos> Uh, I'm afraid your application for tax-exempt status has hit a bump, well, uh, more than a bump.<eos> It's going to be, uh... more complicated than I thought.<eos> I'm sorry if I overpromised, but they're telling me it's a no-go.<eos> Okay. Uh, hope you're great.

Uh, hope you're great.<eos> Um, bye then.<eos> - Aren't you busy in the city?<eos> - I... - Yeah, I needed to see you.<eos> Um... How are you?
- Well, actually, yeah. Kinda, I guess.<eos> That's pretty much it.<eos> - Are you sure about this?<eos> - No problem.<eos> Are you kidding? Take them off my hands, please.<eos> I'm not doing this anymore.<eos> Oh, I love you, but Mommy is done.<eos> - I only need one.<eos> Nothing fits me anymore.<eos> - Oh, that's nice on you.
You want to touch him?<eos> You can.<eos> You hate them, don't you?<eos> Those people in there.<eos> - I wouldn't say hate.<eos> - You need their money, so you have to make them feel good, treat them like they're not the assholes they know deep down they really are.<eos> - That's not... - It's not quite how it works.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Excuse me. There's a pregnant woman here.<eos> - I brought you a, uh, water.
- You don't have to explain it to me, okay?<eos> Look, after Johnny died...<eos> - No, can we please not do this? - I don't want to do this. - Listen to me.<eos> Eddie, listen to me, please.<eos> When Johnny died, I had nothing.<eos> I had no answers as to why it happened.<eos> I had no one, I just... I had nowhere to go.<eos> And you?<eos> You found somewhere to go.<eos> I mean, you... you found a place that has the answers that you need, you know?
- Yeah.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I did not like that tonight.<eos> Him just trotting us out in front of all those people, his little success stories.<eos> That didn't feel bad to you?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm just so used to feeling ashamed of everything that's happened to me.<eos> Felt good to have someone show me off.<eos> Be proud of what I've been through.<eos> - I don't want to take that away from you. All right? I'm just...
That didn't feel bad to you?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm just so used to feeling ashamed of everything that's happened to me.<eos> Felt good to have someone show me off.<eos> Be proud of what I've been through.<eos> - I don't want to take that away from you. All right? I'm just...<eos> I mean, what gives him the right - to... to touch you like that?<eos> - Like what?<eos> - You know what I mean, like he owns you.<eos> - Hey, hey, I'm here with you, and this is where I want to be, okay?
And not what you preach.<eos> Because I'm having a really hard time.<eos> - It's hell.<eos> It's a living, waking hell.<eos> I'm never without regret, much as it goes against everything we teach.<eos> It's... just always, always with me.<eos> All I can do is... Is try to make up for it, but I...<eos> That's why this place, I didn't want to let it go b...<eos> Come here.<eos> I want to show you.
- Yes, the final four are all Chrises this year.<eos> It's never happened before.<eos> - I cannot believe how stupid this show is.<eos> - I know, it's so dumb.<eos> But if you can talk "The Bachelorette," you can get through this or any barbeque.<eos> And, not to mention, my cousin's wedding coming up.<eos> Wink, wink.<eos> Just sayin'.<eos> Uh, this is actually it right here, on the left.<eos> We don't have to go in. If you think it's too much.
- I want to continue my climb.<eos> Here.<eos> - What'd your mom say about it?<eos> - She gets it.<eos> Or... or she will.<eos> Eventually.<eos> - Ah, she can't be, uh... happy to see you go.<eos> - Is her happiness the most important thing?<eos> I mean, I don't remember... her being happy being a rung on The Ladder.<eos> - Well, her happiness is important to me and it is important to you.
Chocolate?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mmm. I know I should feel guilty...<eos> - What, about the chocolate?<eos> - Please. But I don't.<eos> Not at all.<eos> This needed to happen.<eos> - One last time.<eos> - Hey. Don't let it in.<eos> Whatever real life thought you were thinking, don't... don't let it in.
- Hey. Don't let it in.<eos> Whatever real life thought you were thinking, don't... don't let it in.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Have a moment?<eos> - So you talked to my mom?<eos> - You honor The Movement with your dedication.<eos> We should honor you in return.<eos> - So I can stay? - Yeah, no...<eos> - Yeah, not only that,<eos> I would like to invite you to climb to 2R with me.
- Yeah, not only that,<eos> I would like to invite you to climb to 2R with me.<eos> You'd do that?<eos> I mean, it's just 2R.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> - I'd be humbled to be your guide.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Why do you feel guilty about that?<eos> Just feels like I'm... keeping a dirty little secret.<eos> - Can you say more?
Okay.<eos> You were late to our session today and I'm really moved by the work that you're doing here, but part of that work is to show up on time.<eos> - I overslept.<eos> The pregnancy makes me tired.<eos> - I know it makes you tired. But I'm asking you to respect our time.<eos> Must be nice, knowing you're never gonna mess up.<eos> - What do you mean by that?<eos> - Well, I mean, you know what you do is right.<eos> You're never gonna mess up your kids, or other people.<eos> Must be why you're worthy of so much love.
- I miss The Movement.<eos> I miss being there.<eos> - Yeah, so, what're you saying?<eos> Like, you want to go back?<eos> - No, no, no, it's not about wanting to go back.<eos> It's just, I miss my life there.<eos> - Okay, so, uh... how much of this is about your wife?<eos> - I'm not talking about my wife.<eos> Hey. I'm talking about just other things.<eos> - Okay, but you know I can't help but ask about her, right?
- Well, I trust that you know what's the most important use of your time.<eos> - I had an interesting session with Mary yesterday.<eos> - Uh, which Mary?<eos> - Cox.<eos> - Right, we have, uh, three now.<eos> It's a popular name.<eos> - She mentioned that you got her a refrigerator.<eos> - Sean and Mary, yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She seems to feel that she has special favor with you.
Hawk Lane is ready to serve.<eos> Those words are so full of power and meaning.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Sorry, I won't do that again.<eos> - How're you doing, Mary?<eos> - Good.<eos> - Hear, uh, you're enjoying your refrigerator.<eos> Leave Sarah out of this.<eos> You know, whatever this is, it's between you and me.
Congratulations on your son's Ascension.<eos> And your grandson.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You haven't seen Kodiak, have you?<eos> - No.<eos> You are clean.<eos> You are yourself before the Neo-self. - I can't...<eos> We are not our Transgressions.<eos> I can't...<eos> You don't understand. If you can't feel the Light's forgiveness, then I can't because of what I did to you...
- Tell me about all the things that you miss.<eos> Look, no judgment, okay? I just...<eos> I just want to know.<eos> - Well, my... my kids.<eos> - Obviously.<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> - And, uh, the people.<eos> - You know? They're just... They're open, they're receptive.<eos> Like you.<eos> I mean, I-I love that about you.
I have to work, like, four jobs for it, but...<eos> But next year, you'll get in for real, though, right?<eos> Yeah, if I get a boatload of financial aid. You'll get it.<eos> So that girl from the bus last night is she your girlfriend?<eos> No, no, she's... just a friend.<eos> Do you have a boyfriend?<eos> Nope.<eos> Did you tell her who I am?<eos> How did you find me?<eos> Um, your dad came into the diner where I work and I asked where you were.
I think the audience really responded.<eos> Well, that's good to hear.<eos> We need to get our message out there.<eos> How lovely.<eos> Summer painted it.<eos> She's very talented.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fresh pine.<eos> It's too bad we burn them.<eos> No one owns you. You own you.
I know.<eos> Are you allowed to talk to people on the outside?<eos> Yeah, of course. We talk to people on the outside all the time.<eos> So they wouldn't have a problem that your mom is in town visiting?<eos> A lot of Meyerists choose to cut off from their families, okay? I have not chosen to do that.<eos> So why are you so worried?<eos> I'm not.<eos> You keep looking out the window.<eos> Yeah, 'cause we're talking about me leaving.<eos> Are you not allowed to leave?
That's sad.<eos> Well, yeah, the assignment was to write a tragedy.<eos> It's kind of like the story of us. Except you're not a beast.<eos> You kinda saw me as one.<eos> And you didn't break up with me to save me from the wild world of beastdom.<eos> Why did you?<eos> I don't know. Things were really hard.<eos> God, this view is incredible.<eos> Restitution!<eos> Um, IGod, this always happens when I'm with you.
You got old.<eos> It's really not a good time, Tessa.<eos> Why don't we do this when the kids aren't around?<eos> Your ex said you'd have my back. Eddie?<eos> Yeah, we were having coffee the other day.<eos> Why did you get in touch with Eddie?<eos> He got in touch with me.<eos> You know my dad? Hey, come on upstairs, Summer.<eos> Let'slet's all go upstairs.<eos> What did Eddie want with you?
Hey, let me walk you.<eos> Leave me alone. You're worse than all of them.<eos> Mom, please, look at me.<eos> Look at me, Mom.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I need you to go.<eos> Now.<eos> Please.<eos> We can talk later privately.<eos> And I would like that very much, to talk to you, but this is not the way to do it.
And now that they're blackmailing me, making it worse,<eos> I think this is the moment that you blow it up, and come clean.<eos> We'd lose everything.<eos> Everyone.<eos> Not necessarily. You know, maybe we can get the Feds to cut us a deal, help us keep it quiet.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, you have to decide for yourself.<eos> But me, I'm not about to start letting these people control me, judge me, tell me how to live my life.<eos> I'm putting a stop to these motherfuckers who promised me I could unburden without any repercussions.<eos> Hey, you know the woman who gave you "The Wizard of Oz" book?
She wasn't a friend of my mom's from college.<eos> Who was she?<eos> She's a counselor.<eos> My parents, they hired her to get me back home.<eos> And you knew who she was when you asked me to go to the baby shower?<eos> You lied to me.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm thinking of going home. And I want you to come with me.<eos> Look, just talk to Wendy one more time, okay?<eos> She can help you see. We can have a life somewhere else, a life we make together.
Why?<eos> Because I'm thinking of going home. And I want you to come with me.<eos> Look, just talk to Wendy one more time, okay?<eos> She can help you see. We can have a life somewhere else, a life we make together.<eos> And if I don't wanna go, will you go without me?<eos> The only thing that's keeping me here is you.<eos> You asked why I broke up with you?<eos> I know things were difficult with your family and everything.<eos> Yeah, but it was more than that.<eos> Cal offered us a house if I broke up with you.
Yeah, but it was more than that.<eos> Cal offered us a house if I broke up with you.<eos> What?<eos> My family needed it.<eos> I couldn't<eos> I wish I had the strength to say no to him, but...<eos> That doesn't make any sense. Why would Cal do that?<eos> Because he didn't want to lose you. He and your mom.<eos> He's not the amazing man that you think he is.<eos> You dad, he would have never that to you, Hawk.

He and your mom.<eos> He's not the amazing man that you think he is.<eos> You dad, he would have never that to you, Hawk.<eos> You don't know a fucking thing about my dad or Cal or any of it.<eos> I have hated myself for what I did to you.
I am not a leader.<eos> Eddie. No, I fucked up.<eos> Okay? I hurt people. You can't mend a 20year practice on a whim.<eos> It wasn't a whim, Felicia.<eos> Faith requires sacrifice. Steve knew that.<eos> He knew we must let go of those who didn't stand with us.<eos> Otherwise the temptation was too great.<eos> Well, I can't be a part of that, all right?<eos> I won't. Maybe it could be changed.<eos> But it has to be done carefully, once you're ensconced as The Guardian and the people feel safe.
So cute.<eos> Arthur?<eos> Oh, Dot, hey.<eos> Uh...<eos> I didn't think you'd pick up.<eos> I-I thought you were on your shift. I am.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right. No. Um, I just, uh...<eos> I want to, uh, say thank you.
Um, in the last couple of years, you know, since... my last thing.<eos> You know, you're-you're a good sister. Okay.<eos> Now you're scaring me.<eos> Yeah, it's... no, I know it sounds weird.<eos> You're not having thoughts, are you?<eos> I mean, nothing obsessive?<eos> What? No.<eos> No, no, no, I'm good.<eos> That's, uh, that's why I'm calling, because I'm good.<eos> I'm doing really well, and I owe you for that.
Oh, what you got behind your ear?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> You got nothing!<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> You poor broken man.<eos> Under the, uh, circumstances, what we can do is, uh, well, what we can do is just, we can call your legal guardian, and if she'll take responsibility, then we'll just...<eos> Oh, God, please, don't call my sister.<eos> - Please. - Hey.<eos> Asshole. Where do you want to spend your weekend?<eos> I'm yelling you, that little shit was scoping us for a reason.
We never should've moved you back into The City.<eos> There's too many triggers for you here.<eos> I saw one of his enforcers.<eos> - There, tonight.<eos> - But, Arthur, you see things, remember?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Things that aren't there.<eos> But this wasn't that, so...<eos> So no weird visions?<eos> No voices telling you what to do? Stop trying to diagnose me, okay?
Come on, man, don't you feel it?<eos> We're part of a plan that's bigger than the both of us.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm a superhero, Arthur.<eos> I'm nigh-invulnerable. I have the reflexes of an Olympic-level jungle cat. I have the strength of ten, perhaps 20 men.<eos> A crowded bus stop of men.<eos> But my greatest power is this.<eos> When destiny speaks, she speaks to me.<eos> She says hi by the way.<eos> And she wanted me to give you this.
I'm trying to prove that The Terror's alive, and that's it.<eos> You're gonna have to do more than just prove it.<eos> I mean, what am I supposed to do with that?<eos> Destiny is calling you, Arthur. - Look at me.<eos> - Yeah, I'm looking at you.<eos> I'm over here, answering our destiny.<eos> Come on over... It's good.<eos> It's warm.<eos> It's like the inside of bread.<eos> I'm not gonna get inside of bread with you. Do you understand that?
There's a laboring mom on her way.<eos> Um, tell me if you hear anything, okay?<eos> Uh, what?<eos> Oh, you guys haven't heard about Karev?<eos> Hey, um, Wilson.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> Well, uh, about Karev.<eos> You know, I... I just thought...<eos> Why are you sorry?
That's not the point, genius.<eos> Your little testosterone game could've cost him his life!<eos> Is that what you wanted... to kill someone over a stupid game?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Is there a problem here?<eos> No problem.<eos> Wait here for your studies.<eos> You think I could, uh, get her number?<eos> Shut up.<eos> You, um, sure you're okay?
I was in Path. I was getting a culture.<eos> Come on.<eos> You've been in your head all day.<eos> It's fine, 'cause I covered for you, but... talk to someone.<eos> Work it out.<eos> What do you need, Warren?<eos> Do you need me to be fragile?<eos> Do you need me to fall apart?<eos> - Oh, come on, now.<eos> - Would that help you?
You okay?<eos> - Is it a patient?<eos> - No. But yeah.<eos> Yeah, that, too.<eos> Do you want to... talk about it?<eos> I can't.<eos> It's not something you want to hear about.<eos> Okay.<eos> I miss Alex.<eos> And I know that that's not fair to say to you, but it's true.
I stink.<eos> I need to wash off this day.<eos> So you keep going.<eos> You don't give up.<eos> You stand tall.<eos> Alex? !<eos> - What the hell, Mer?<eos> Alex?<eos> You always show up to save the day.<eos> Wait. I've been looking for you all day.
Everybody wants privacy for themselves.<eos> Do you have any idea how many places I've been looking for you?
You can't call?<eos> You can't text?<eos> What happened?<eos> For other people, not so much.<eos> They said that the trial was canceled.<eos> You said you were taking a plea.<eos> I did.<eos> Are you in hiding? Are you evading the law?<eos> Are you on the lam?<eos> ! Alex. I can help you, but, I mean, I have kids here.
Hey. So, what's the fallout from last night?<eos> So far, nothing.<eos> Why? What have you heard?<eos> Well, Minnick's car is here, so that means she obviously wasn't fired.<eos> You know what Minnick's car looks like? So?<eos> That...<eos> That's not weird.<eos> - Hey, did you hear about Alex?<eos> - No. Yeah, Andrew told me.<eos> - Did he tell you why?
It's not a dirty word, Pierce.<eos> - Mom, why? !<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I might want to have a few things spruced up.<eos> And you said Dr. Avery is the best.<eos> She's right.<eos> I'll see you this afternoon.<eos> Mom, what is going on?<eos> I just spoke to you two days ago.
- Private.<eos> Nutballs?<eos> I tried to bake cupcakes, bring them over, say, "Hi.<eos> Welcome."<eos> She didn't like that, either?<eos> Her husband just yelled, "We have guns!"<eos> He died a while back.<eos> I only see her when she gets her newspaper... 6:30 sharp every morning.<eos> But yesterday, the paper just sat there for hours.<eos> Finally, I peeked over the fence, thinking, "Grace, you're gonna get your dumb head shot off."
Really, Karev?<eos> The second I give you your job back?<eos> Look, since you've been here.<eos> Get out of my office before I change my mind.<eos> Go!<eos> Just promise me you won't turn her into a fish-lipped monster with an immobile forehead.<eos> That's not something I do.<eos> I'm just reminding you that you swore a sacred oath as a physician to give sound medical counsel to women who are already beautiful.<eos> To you.<eos> I'm not worried about you.

What are you calling this, again?<eos> This is called inflammatory breast cancer, or IBC.<eos> It's a local form of the disease.<eos> Maggie's gonna have a million questions.<eos> Will you help me tell her?<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Of course.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I'm sorry if I pushed.<eos> What's between you and Dr. Webber - is none of my business...
- You never gave me a chance to say...<eos> - Don't, okay?<eos> - Don't thank me.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I hurt you.<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> It was a misunderstanding.<eos> You got the wrong end of me overreacting.<eos> I'm glad you're okay, and I'm really sorry.
- I'm not.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I hurt you.<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> It was a misunderstanding.<eos> You got the wrong end of me overreacting.<eos> I'm glad you're okay, and I'm really sorry.<eos> You serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I gave you every chance to say that.
I saw you almost every day.<eos> I worked for your friends every day.<eos> I knew what happened that night.<eos> I knew what you were thinking.<eos> I knew why you hit me.<eos> And if you would have just treated me like a human being, if you would have just talked to me, maybe we could have avoided all this.<eos> I didn't think you'd listen.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm a pretty good guy!<eos> Why'd you do it?<eos> - I don't have to explain myself to you.
Guys, I'm here if you need anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You are right.<eos> You don't any idea who I am anymore, because you haven't taken the time to try.<eos> The moment I left your father, it was like I could finally breathe.<eos> Now, I know that's not something you want to hear, but it's true.<eos> I...<eos> I have finally become the person that I always wanted to be.<eos> I want my mother back.<eos> I'm sorry you don't like who I've become, but I do.
God, I couldn't wait for her to go.<eos> She makes some good lasagna, though.<eos> Are you seeing this?<eos> Bailey hired an interim chief of General?<eos> Bailey replaced you?<eos> Kepner?<eos> Kepner.<eos> Every day you don't open the door, it gets a little easier to stay inside.<eos> I can't pull you out anymore.<eos> No one can open this door but you.
This chair's the only place my stomach and back can get comfortable, so...<eos> What are you doing up?<eos> I have three kids.<eos> I don't sleep.<eos> Motherhood.<eos> I always wanted more kids so Maggie could have a sister or a brother.<eos> I was worried when she wanted to move out here.<eos> She was happy in Boston, but...<eos> I'm really glad she found you.<eos> You said your stomach is bothering you?
No.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I don't want you passing things down.<eos> That's not...<eos> I-I don't like that.<eos> Oh, that's not why.<eos> It's just that I have decided I don't have to do this anymore.<eos> I am a woman of a certain age, and I have earned the right to sit down, put my feet up, and let you cook for me.<eos> Mom.<eos> And you're not gonna like it when I'm gone and you're missing my lasagna.
So, I'm gonna put out a couple of calls to some old professors from Boston.<eos> Do you remember Dr. Luckett?<eos> He specializes in radioactive...<eos> Maggie...<eos> Don't you dare quit on me now.<eos> Y-You can't.<eos> You can't quit on me.<eos> We can beat this.<eos> You have to fight.<eos> I'll help you.
He specializes in radioactive...<eos> Maggie...<eos> Don't you dare quit on me now.<eos> Y-You can't.<eos> You can't quit on me.<eos> We can beat this.<eos> You have to fight.<eos> I'll help you.<eos> Sweetie...<eos> Sit down and let me talk to you.
I'm dying.<eos> I have to impart wisdom.<eos> This wisdom, right now?<eos> You have got time.<eos> You don't have to go there right now.<eos> I've had orgasms.<eos> Oh, well, good.<eos> They're not a gift.<eos> It's your right.<eos> Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
Make a mistake.<eos> I have a job.<eos> Well, you're never gonna look back and say,<eos> "I wish I'd been more uptight."<eos> Okay, Mom, you have to be still, or else I can't finish this.<eos> And stop always saying what everyone wants to hear.<eos> Tell someone off.<eos> It's good for 'em and better for you.<eos> Especially if it's a car salesperson.<eos> - Do you like the color?
And it has to be somebody who's worthy.<eos> Find a decent man who loves you just a little more than you love him.<eos> How about equally as much?<eos> How about that?<eos> No, he needs to think he is lucky to have you and not the other way around.<eos> Other hand.<eos> Never make yourself small for anyone.<eos> Be your own person.<eos> And try wearing a little lipstick.<eos> You know, Mom, if you keep going at this rate, you're gonna run out of advice before tomorrow.
Be your own person.<eos> And try wearing a little lipstick.<eos> You know, Mom, if you keep going at this rate, you're gonna run out of advice before tomorrow.<eos> Phew, this polish smells.<eos> Want me to open a window?<eos> Oh.<eos> It stopped raining.<eos> Okay, I'm not gonna leave it open too long, or you'll catch a chill.<eos> Typical.<eos> Bring you to a hospital, help you catch a cold.
Fucking Euros.<eos> We come to these rooms, we work the steps and we trust that one day, we'll be rewarded.<eos> And then, eventually, that day comes and the reward is greater than we could ever imagine.<eos> I met a girl.<eos> And this girl's different from all the other girls that I've ever been with, in that, she actually likes me.<eos> She likes me for who I am.<eos> Well, she doesn't really know me yet.<eos> It's still early days.<eos> I haven't told her that I am sober.<eos> Looks like you on top of the world, huh?
No, it's just that...<eos> I'm supposed to go meet London.<eos> Do you want to get sober or not?<eos> Yes.<eos> Just not in this towel.<eos> Oh, yeah. Well, come get a shirt.<eos> Who was that girl I saw last night coming out of the house?<eos> Oh, fuck you, man. You are not gonna swoop. Not this time.<eos> - Hey, man. I just asked her name.<eos> - Well, I'm not telling you.
Hey, neighbor!<eos> - That's my neighbor.<eos> - What is this?<eos> I never told you about the time I was failing all my college courses and my parents cut me off, so I went to the 7-11 and I bought a lottery ticket and won a couple hundred G's?<eos> - No.<eos> - You're in for a treat.<eos> So I was failing all my college courses and my parents cut me off, so I went down to the 7-11, bought a lottery ticket,<eos> - won a couple hundred--<eos> - Couple hundred G's.<eos> So I did tell you about that!
♪ Is the now ♪<eos> - So present.<eos> So beautiful.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Chip! - Hey.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Oh, come here.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I want you to meet Karel.
I can't drink this.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Is it that disgusting?<eos> - No.<eos> No, no. No, it's not that.<eos> - Gosh. I'm sorry.<eos> No. You don't need to apologize. I get it.<eos> I totally get it.<eos> - Yeah-- - I mean, come on. You're a sommelier.<eos> This wine probably tastes like shit to you. It's fine.
A mistake that I turned into a "shopportunity."<eos> It's a star!<eos> Thank you, Kimmy.<eos> It's Orson Snyder's 75th birthday.<eos> Look at what I found him.<eos> You got him a Ping-Pong paddle?<eos> The Ping-Pong paddle that Forrest Gump used to defeat the Chinese.<eos> While you were in the bunker, we found out that Forrest Gump is real.<eos> -Mm-hmm. So is Russ coming back for the party?<eos> I should've bought you one of those sexy clear belts I saw at Christie's.
It's your funeral.<eos> Still no sign of Lucifer?<eos> I went by his place.<eos> It's completely packed up.<eos> No e-mails, no calls, nothing.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Just... it is what it is.<eos> You know, Chloe, you don't have to pretend with me.<eos> I know you're upset.<eos> I mean, he's your partner, he should've told you he was leaving.
Hey...<eos> Full of '90s jams, I see.<eos> The Bangles, N'Sync,<eos> Right Said Fred?<eos> - Give me the phone back. - I mean, seriously, Detective, your music queue alone is enough to disqualify you from this case.<eos> You're not the one who's on this case, Lucifer.<eos> What? But what about our partnership?<eos> Our partnership ended when you ghosted me and the entire department.<eos> You can't just march back in here like nothing's wrong.<eos> You can't just grab what you want when you want.
I got a boob job, and it totally expanded my horizons.<eos> Because then, I could do something none of the other girls could do.<eos> You wanna see?<eos> - Ooh, yes.<eos> - No.<eos> No?<eos> It's called "acting as if." Yes.<eos> Yes, well done, Candy.<eos> I think I know exactly how to get back on the case.<eos> Gosh, I wish I'd talked to you earlier. Saved myself a trip.
That's generous.<eos> See that vein popping out the side of your neck?<eos> Same thing happens when I throw the dishes in the trash instead of washing them.<eos> I'm an idiot.<eos> Look, I know Lucifer better than anyone, okay, and he does this sometimes.<eos> Disappears, does stupid, impulsive things.<eos> But he always comes back around, Chloe.<eos> Yeah, but this time I don't want him to.<eos> I'm serious, I am done.<eos> I'm done. But he did get you an in with that mediator.
And that's why you chose an idiotic, bedazzled tweener as your partner.<eos> I'm sorry, Candy, there's no name calling in here.<eos> Even if it's to yourself.<eos> Lucifer, would you like to respond?<eos> This is gonna be hard for you to understand, but... I've been through Hell recently. Both figuratively and literally.<eos> True torment, my greatest fears realized.<eos> Lucifer, I am the one who almost died.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> That is what I'm talking about.<eos> I almost believe you care.
There she is!<eos> Marla!<eos> Will you bring her up to the front?<eos> Come on.<eos> Marla, everybody.<eos> See?<eos> You need me.<eos> That better not be Marla's bass.<eos> It's already been processed.<eos> And, I've written you a song.
That better not be Marla's bass.<eos> It's already been processed.<eos> And, I've written you a song.<eos> Ready?<eos> Okay, it was wiped down pretty good, but...<eos> I found traces of Ash's blood on the tuning knobs.<eos> What, so Marla's the killer?<eos> Murder solved!<eos> And I believe that proves just how much the department needs me.<eos> Including you.
Murder solved!<eos> And I believe that proves just how much the department needs me.<eos> Including you.<eos> We got a stalker, which is normally bad, but makes me very happy right now 'cause I was getting very uncomfortable.<eos> What on Earth does he want?<eos> You know I watched over Chloe for weeks after you disappeared, right?<eos> Angel or creeper, brother?<eos> It's a fine line. You asked me to guard her, so I did.<eos> Like an idiot!<eos> You see, because I thought that she meant something to you.
That she is.<eos> A whoopee cushion sent from Dad.<eos> I'm sure he's having a right old laugh at the moment. Right.<eos> So that means it's okay to turn your back on Chloe?<eos> Just ignore her feelings?<eos> Feelings she had no control over.<eos> Feelings that aren't real.<eos> But she doesn't know that.<eos> Which is why I had to save her from...<eos> From you.
Don't worry. He's fine.<eos> Did you save him?<eos> Thank you!<eos> All righty. That's...<eos> His job is way too dangerous.<eos> I begged him to quit, but no.<eos> My hubby's all about his work.<eos> He is?<eos> My God, it's "Detective this," and "Detective that."<eos> Working with you means so much to him.
Statement given...<eos> Candy.!<eos> Candy darling, the detective's not a big fan of PDA.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm just glad she's here for you.<eos> See you tomorrow at the precinct.<eos> Detective.<eos> Don't be late.<eos> _<eos> Amenadiel seems to think I owe you a chat.
Candy.!<eos> Candy darling, the detective's not a big fan of PDA.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm just glad she's here for you.<eos> See you tomorrow at the precinct.<eos> Detective.<eos> Don't be late.<eos> _<eos> Amenadiel seems to think I owe you a chat.<eos> So I'll start by saying I do not forgive you.
Why do you think you lost that fight?<eos> I don't know, let's have a think, shall we?<eos> Not enough cardio?<eos> The fact that dear old Dad's slightly almighty?<eos> Because I was young, woefully foolish and...<eos> Unarmed?<eos> You know that if you had possessed the Flaming Sword, the weapon that guarded Eden, the weapon that can cut through anything, even the Gates of Heaven itself, well, you would've won that rebellion.<eos> Why are you dwelling in the past?<eos> The fact is, I didn't have the sword, and Dad destroyed it soon after, so...<eos> What if I told you that the sword was right here, on Earth?
We have everything we need to go home.<eos> Well, the Oscar goes to Candy Morningstar.<eos> You think they bought it?<eos> Yes, my mother doesn't know what hit her.<eos> So, thank you.<eos> For helping me peek inside that scheming head of hers.<eos> Well, it's the least I could do.<eos> After what you did for me in Vegas?<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Pretty sure I'm gonna owe you for the rest of it. Let's call it even, shall we?
In fact, why don't you add this one to the, pot?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll put them both to good use.<eos> 'Cause, you know, I totally have so many plans.<eos> God.<eos> Well, to making plans.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> I get why you had me con your family. But what is going on with you and Detective Decker?
What if there is no hidden agenda, Mom?<eos> Why would I be surprised?<eos> You disappeared after I almost died?<eos> Does Chloe know that you zagged Candy?<eos> Everything I felt for her was smoke and mirrors, courtesy of Dad.<eos> So it's okay to ignore her feelings?<eos> Feelings that aren't real.<eos> But she doesn't know that.<eos> Which is why I had to save her!<eos> From you.
But she doesn't know that.<eos> Which is why I had to save her!<eos> From you.<eos> I manipulated him.<eos> I pushed him too hard.<eos> I did this.<eos> The Oscar goes to Candy Morningstar. You think they bought it?<eos> My mother doesn't know what hit her.<eos> Thank you for helping me peek inside that scheming head of hers.<eos> What if I told you that the Flaming Sword is. Azrael's blade?
So you're saying the blade can sense my emotional state?<eos> It's the most powerful weapon in the universe, Mum... The sword that guarded Eden, not a groovy mood ring.<eos> Maybe I should try it.<eos> Your brother is the Lightbringer, Amenadiel.<eos> He just needs to apply himself and get angry!<eos> Well, I can't just get ang... Aah!<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> Well, it was worth a shot. Right.<eos> Maybe Amenadiel should try it.<eos> Here, why don't you hold it, and I'll kick you in the...
Are we talking clouds?<eos> Harps?<eos> Old dudes in white robes?<eos> And my dad is Morgan Freeman?<eos> Focus, Doctor.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> I need you to help me control my emotions.<eos> Well, emotions can't be controlled, Lucifer.<eos> Isn't that your entire job?<eos> My job is to help you understand your emotions.
Harps?<eos> Old dudes in white robes?<eos> And my dad is Morgan Freeman?<eos> Focus, Doctor.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> I need you to help me control my emotions.<eos> Well, emotions can't be controlled, Lucifer.<eos> Isn't that your entire job?<eos> My job is to help you understand your emotions.<eos> I can help you become aware of what it is you're feeling, or trying to avoid feeling.
I think you married her to hide something.<eos> - Or from something.<eos> - Right, look, what I may or may not be hiding is beside the point, Doctor.<eos> Either way, I need the sword lit.<eos> So, come on.<eos> Emotions.<eos> Chop, chop.<eos> You clearly have a lot of walls up, Lucifer.<eos> Between yourself and your emotions, and now between yourself and me.<eos> If you're unwilling to bring those walls down, I can't help you.
Yeah, I want to talk to my daughter for a second.<eos> Please don't be mad at him.<eos> I should be the one in trouble.<eos> I'm not mad at you.<eos> You're not in trouble, Monkey.<eos> I do want you to know you can talk to me if something's going on.<eos> I know.<eos> You know that?<eos> You want to talk about something now?<eos> I could tell you anything?
Too much of that will make you go blind.<eos> Mom was right.<eos> I can't make it work.<eos> I see.<eos> You're up here practicing a different kind of self-flagellation, are you?<eos> Hoping for a celestial spark?<eos> You don't even have your powers.<eos> Yeah, thanks for that reminder, Luci.<eos> You know, I also don't seem to have much of Mom's attention anymore.<eos> Because, unlike you, I don't have some glorious destiny to wield the sword.
'Cause so far, it's just Mum's word against, well, reality.<eos> What if she's wrong, brother?<eos> She's been acting very odd recently.<eos> On edge.<eos> This obsession with getting home, it's a bit much, don't you think?<eos> You see, I thought we all wanted to go back.<eos> You know I don't lie, brother.<eos> So trust me when I say nothing would make me happier than Mum getting her wish.<eos> Then you need to stop fighting this, Luci, and find a way to get the sword to work.<eos> Because whether we like it or not, it is all on you.
Wait.<eos> I'm a father?<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Here you go.<eos> How cute this guy is.<eos> So...<eos> I went back to that school today.<eos> And I think they'd let you in if you wanted to go.<eos> So how do you feel about that?<eos> Well, can I tell you how it made me feel being there?
Do tell.<eos> So this secret plan to cut through the Gates of Heaven...<eos> Well, actually, we've hit a bit of a snag with that.<eos> The Flaming Sword's kaput.<eos> Now, we can't work out what's wrong with it, and until we can, we're in a bit of a holding pattern.<eos> - That's a relief.<eos> - Well, why would you say that?<eos> God and His ex having a fight to the death?<eos> Sounds kind of bad for, you know, humanity.<eos> You'll probably be fine.
What can I do for you?<eos> Well, it's what I can do for you that's exciting.<eos> See, I can reveal the truth about the Supreme Being you've chosen to impersonate.<eos> I bet you wanted to be God because.<eos> He's benevolent, all-powerful, yada yada.<eos> But in actual fact, He's a dick.<eos> Look, if you want to be angry with me, you just go right on ahead.<eos> I can be anything you need me to be.<eos> Right, enough of this idle chit-chat.<eos> Time to tell you what the charade's really about.
Because it's just crazy talk coming from a mentally ill human.<eos> - Well, there might be another reason. - Right.<eos> What's that?<eos> Well, Earth is His favorite toy.<eos> Maybe He got fed up of looking at it from afar.<eos> I mean, it's not an entirely awful place.<eos> Even you have to admit that.<eos> Now you're the one sounding crazy, Luci, because Earth... Earth is nothing compared to Heaven.<eos> Come now, brother.<eos> I think you've grown to like the place, haven't you?
Markowitz?<eos> Want a taste?<eos> Don't you have better things to do than to raid our fridge?<eos> I was about to leave this place altogether, but I hit an unexpected snag.<eos> Now I need to distract myself with something.<eos> Hello, something.<eos> You know, just in case I'm giving off an<eos> "I have zero self-respect" vibe, let me make it clear.<eos> Hands off.<eos> I'd rather sit at home alone, and in the dark, than to hang out with you.
And lady.<eos> Buy in's ten thousand big ones.<eos> Right, high stakes.<eos> I like it.<eos> Pig farts!<eos> Crash and burn.<eos> I see, you're one of those.<eos> Right.<eos> - 200.<eos> - I swear, I am gonna stab you in the eye if you do not stop dealing me crap!
Right, never mind.<eos> Maybe I can help.<eos> - I did see him perform a miracle.<eos> - Really?<eos> He scored me an extra Jell-O at snack time.<eos> Useless.<eos> Royal flush.<eos> - Cheater!<eos> - Red pubic hair!<eos> Billy, what did I tell you about throwing your underwear?
I should get going anyhow.<eos> Well, listen, um, if maybe, if you want to talk some more, about Lucifer or, anything else, feel free, to give me a call.<eos> My cell phone number's there. Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Maze.<eos> What's up?<eos> I'll give you one chance to apologize.<eos> Apologize?<eos> You punched me.<eos> Tell you what I can do:

What's up?<eos> I'll give you one chance to apologize.<eos> Apologize?<eos> You punched me.<eos> Tell you what I can do:<eos> I can forgive you.<eos> Taking the high ground, are we? Magnificent.<eos> Well, I may have struck the latest blow, but that is only in response to the litany of offenses that you, dear old Dad, have bestowed upon me.<eos> So you believe me?<eos> Good. Tell me, just what is it you think I've done?
Now, that's not the Samael I remember.<eos> No.<eos> No, Dad, this is who you made me when you cast me away!<eos> Now apologize!<eos> Lucifer?<eos> Guy sounds like he wants to bang.<eos> He's Lucifer's doctor, Maze.<eos> So what?<eos> Doctors don't want to get laid?<eos> Does everything always have to be about sex with you?
You know, it'll be like a hip-hop video.<eos> You said you wanted to expand our circle of friends.<eos> That's not what I meant at all.<eos> You want to ride solo with Dr. McHotty.<eos> I can get behind that.<eos> Or on top, dealer's choice.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Okay, I'll set it all up.<eos> You won't have to lift a finger.<eos> Let me help you.
Hey, Maze.<eos> You still want to help me?<eos> Okay, so that was "God" God back there?<eos> As in capital "G"?<eos> I didn't bow. I should have bowed.<eos> You should have spit in His face.<eos> Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.<eos> Then you're no use to me, Doctor.<eos> What on earth are you doing here anyway?<eos> Chloe sent me to check on you because she was worried.
Unfortunately, Dad seems to be soft on Mum.<eos> Like he still has feelings for her.<eos> Which gives me another way to punish them, far more tortuous than death.<eos> And we're back to "not good."<eos> No, no, no, no, this is better.<eos> And you, my dear doctor, are going to help me.<eos> Okay, you've all been chosen to help with a very special mission called. "Operation Help Lucifer Escape from the Hospital."<eos> That's a little on the nose, son.<eos> You are literally the judgiest person in the universe.<eos> You know that, Dad?
I don't need what he needs.<eos> What I need is a friend.<eos> You want your privacy.<eos> Gotcha, Decker.<eos> Excuse my roommate.<eos> Sh...<eos> No, that's, it's nothing compared to the, intriguing folks I deal with at work.<eos> I can imagine. I-I actually would love to hear about that.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I wasn't planning on having sex with you again, but...
Whatever, right?<eos> At least someone's getting laid.<eos> I'm not here for sex, Maze.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then, what?<eos> I just...<eos> There's not much time before we're gone.<eos> What, are you going on a vacation?<eos> I'm not sure I'd call what Lucifer, Mom and I are doing going a vacation, but...<eos> Lucifer didn't tell you.

A ladder.<eos> Now, I had no idea you were so angry with me.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause I... I've been pretty up-front about it.<eos> But to want to destroy me?<eos> That's pretty serious.<eos> You mind telling me why?<eos> Because... because I'm your son.<eos> And... you rejected me.<eos> Well, then I guess I can't say as I blame you.
Previously on Lucifer...<eos> Operation "Help Lucifer Escape From the Hospital."<eos> And you, my dear doctor, are going to help me.<eos> Let's go. The three of you plan to use... this Flaming Sword to cut through the gates of Heaven and go home.<eos> - What does Maze think of your plan?<eos> - Well, I don't know; I haven't told her.<eos> So what, are you going on a vacation?<eos> Lucifer didn't tell you.
No, no, no, don't, don't.<eos> That won't do any good.<eos> What happened?<eos> A couple of weeks ago, I maybe, sort of... helped Lucifer break out of a mental institution.<eos> Using my own name.<eos> - It's my fault, really.<eos> - No, it is not your fault.<eos> It is Lucifer's fault.<eos> It's always Lucifer's fault.<eos> First, I find out he's ditching me to go to Heaven, and now he's hurting you.
Hello, Daniel.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Ms. Ruiz there... is my client.<eos> Well, she's a real piece of work.<eos> Trying to make me jealous?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> You seduce me, you betray me, now you're back.<eos> You have to want something, I just can't figure out what.<eos> I do want something, you're right.<eos> And I'll tell you.

- Fine.<eos> Good. It's settled.<eos> The detective and I will go, so thank you so much for your help.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> The invitation is under my name.<eos> I will go.<eos> Perhaps Detective Espinoza should join me. No.<eos> Yes, that's not happening.<eos> - Very well.<eos> I'll go with you...
Because you have been a terrible, selfish friend.<eos> To her.<eos> Now you're gonna fix it.<eos> Well, gladly, once I figure a way back onto the case.<eos> No, Lucifer.<eos> Now!<eos> But I suppose they can handle things without me for the time being.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> It'll take two hours to scan the phone.<eos> I'll come to you.
Well, I would have known that if you had just given me...<eos> How do the police know it was you?<eos> I may have... dropped my phone.<eos> Chet, what was on your phone?<eos> Let's go somewhere quieter.<eos> No, Mom.<eos> Mom, Mom.<eos> The whole business?<eos> I was just trying to learn how the financial part worked, Ma.<eos> You know, prove to you I could be a part of this.
I mean, he would never admit it, right? But yeah.<eos> Yeah, everything.<eos> Even women?<eos> I just noticed that you and Lucifer have a weird relationship with Charlotte Richards.<eos> I just thought maybe you guys...<eos> No, Dan, we are not competing over Charlotte.<eos> Trust me.<eos> At least, not in the way you think.<eos> And if we are, well, obviously I lost.<eos> Because I'm here, with you.
Now that we've solved that, I can get back to the case and... Ooh!<eos> God!<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> What? You just made everything worse.<eos> Why am I surprised?<eos> Just leave.<eos> Since that's been your plan all along anyway.<eos> Is that what all this has been about?<eos> Amenadiel told you about our trip back to Heaven, didn't he?
No, no. No one's dead.<eos> We did this to each other.<eos> Though... when it comes to your case, I fear I may have, um... complicated things.<eos> Lucifer told him you used to screw.<eos> Among other things.<eos> Well, I guess that's that.<eos> No, that isn't that.<eos> I want to know why she's still upset with me.<eos> Since I'm not currently a practicing doctor of psychiatry, I don't have to lead you on this path of realization;<eos> I can just tell you.
Maze is pissed at you because you used her.<eos> Sure.<eos> But for the greater good of our debauchery here in L.A.<eos> Did you even once think of how this affected her?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> Thought about how she might ruin everything by disemboweling my mum or castrating my brother.<eos> I meant her feelings.<eos> - What?<eos> - She thought... you abandoned her.<eos> That you didn't care how that affected her.
But if you ever hurt Dan again, I'll have someone break your legs.<eos> That's my brother.<eos> I've been trying to get ahold of him forever.<eos> Can you watch the phone?<eos> Sure.<eos> Thanks.<eos> See?<eos> Light.<eos> Start talking.<eos> What happened to you?
This.<eos> It's just a little fisticuffs between friends.<eos> I just had a very enlightening conversation with Charlotte Richards.<eos> Well, I've had my fill of enlightening conversations for today, thank you.<eos> Lucifer, she told me who she really is, and how you two are related.<eos> I somehow doubt that.<eos> No, it all makes sense.<eos> Why you were so disgusted when I suggested you two had slept together.<eos> Why you act so weird around her in general.<eos> She... really told you.

See your hands!<eos> LAPD.<eos> Bianca Ruiz, you're under arrest.<eos> This is absurd.<eos> Charlotte.<eos> Charlotte.<eos> Will no longer be representing you.<eos> You're making a terrible mistake.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Charlotte, are you okay?
I need to search her.<eos> Well, I don't think that's necessary, Detective.<eos> - Well, I do.<eos> - It's okay, son.<eos> Fine.<eos> Arms out.<eos> You're being incredibly thorough.<eos> I like it.<eos> - She's clean.<eos> - Well, I told you, Detective, she's got nothing to hide.
"The Medallion of Life."<eos> Johnson's belt buckle.<eos> And the key that binds them all together.<eos> Well, keys don't bind, they unlock.<eos> I think someone needs to go back to translation school.<eos> And guess who has the key.<eos> Well, don't leave me in suspense.<eos> Who is it, brother?<eos> It says that God entrusted the key to his favorite son.<eos> Of course he gave it to you.
Well, the key to completing my ensemble maybe.<eos> Here.<eos> Try and attach your ring to this.<eos> - Brother.<eos> - Just do it. And we'll confirm what we already know.<eos> - Brother...<eos> - That Father's favorite, despite everything that you have done, is and always has been you.<eos> Look down.<eos> Is that the key around your neck or are you just happy to see me?<eos> He entrusted it... to you, brother.
- Not bad. Yes, not bad! You get it!<eos> - I feel I'm at the height of my powers.<eos> - You are, buddy.<eos> Right?<eos> - Juggle! - Alright, let's...<eos> Oh my, God, it's a nice day.<eos> I could go all night.<eos> Finished yet?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> I'm just kind of smooshing it up against you.
I'm gonna get everything from the watermelon salad down.<eos> I will take all of that and whatever you want.<eos> Do you want food or some drinks or...<eos> I think that's probably plenty for the both of us.<eos> - Sounds good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - I love your smile. What a lovely smile.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - What is going on with you?
There's an email right here.<eos> You're cc'd on it. You called me and then emailed everyone to cover your tracks like some psychopath.<eos> Get out of here! Get out of here, man!<eos> It's... get out of here, man.<eos> That's how you say it!<eos> Samantha.<eos> Sam.<eos> I'm sorry that I made us go in there.<eos> You didn't make me do anything.<eos> I make poor choices whenever I'm around you and I can't seem to stop.
The adventure begins.<eos> Previously on "You Me Her"...<eos> Were you drunk this time?<eos> - No. - Me neither.<eos> My November rent.<eos> Only fair, 'cause I didn't give you any notice.
- We're gonna lose everything.<eos> - No, we're not. - Yeah, we are.<eos> - No, we're not.<eos> Yeah, we are. - We're gonna lose everything.<eos> - Emma, no, listen to me.<eos> Yes, listen, you don't have a job.<eos> - I'm gonna lose --<eos> - Listen to me, okay?<eos> Kiss me.<eos> Kiss me like you saw my plane crash, but you didn't know I parachuted out until I came up behind you and tapped you on the shoulder.
So, it's not so much kissing as it is like -- like knocking visors.<eos> We're about to die anyway, so we take off our helmets.<eos> Just grab each other by the face.<eos> Well, yeah, but at which point, your head would, like, explode because you're hurtling through space at like a million miles --<eos> - Oh, just kiss me. - Cool.<eos> Cool, cool, cool.<eos> I mean, I won't even ask how two people can possibly divert a...<eos> You know what? I-I've got a good one.<eos> Kiss me like I built a time machine and I went back to the night that Lori Matherfield's parents met, seduced her father, married him, devoted five years making sure that no version of Lori was ever conceived,<eos> built another time machine in our basement with, like, crude 1970s technology, then finally made my way to you.
Guys, it's not a competition.<eos> - Of course it's not. - No.<eos> No, it's about you.<eos> But if it was...<eos> - I would've won. - ... I could --<eos> Uh, guys.<eos> It's a tie.<eos> I declare this a tie, so thank you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And thank you. - Thank you.
You know, unemployed polygamists?<eos> Oh, yeah. You should just shave your heads and get, like, crazy tribal face tattoos.<eos> You know, just fuck it, right, cuz?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - Yeah. Be good for you?<eos> Can we talk somewhere a little more, you know, private?<eos> Sure, yeah, that's where I was going.<eos> I'll leave you with this because it's suddenly taken on greater relevance.<eos> I got a connection at Griffin College, and it seems they're expanding their psych department.<eos> So I will get you a meeting, little brother.
- It's, uh, time for us to be anywhere else in the known universe. - It's - - Mm-hmm.<eos> The sitter -- we only had her for like 45 minutes tonight.<eos> You guys got to talk.<eos> You know? I mean, all three of you.<eos> Don't just let it gurgle around in there.<eos> Yeah, you're right. Okay.<eos> You're right.<eos> Water.<eos> Dear God, why isn't there water?<eos> Maybe there was water, and karma took it away from you.
Previously on "You Me Her"...<eos> We're together.<eos> We're a throuple.<eos> I got a connection at Griffin College, and they're expanding their psych department.<eos> So I will get you a meeting, little brother.
I mean, I don't know.<eos> It's just all happening so fast.<eos> Maybe that's why the kitchen's rotating.<eos> Vodka guzzled by the bottle might be another contributing factor.<eos> Yeah. I heard that doesn't mix very well with fertility meds.<eos> Probably not.<eos> I should've danced.<eos> Okay? Sorry I was acting like such a dick.<eos> Oh, let's just go back to being dizzy together.<eos> I will make out with you, but brush your teeth.
You ever see her?<eos> Occasionally.<eos> Here and there.<eos> Mainly 'cause I married her about a decade ago.<eos> - No shit.<eos> - Not an ounce of shit.<eos> Kids?<eos> That's been a trickier road.<eos> Sorry. I didn't mean to...<eos> What about you? What about that ex-boyfriend that you got back together with and then told me about by text message?
I'm starting to think I want the job I walked away from.<eos> Or some version of that.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I got a thing.<eos> Um, can I see you again?<eos> Like, just for coffee or something?<eos> Confession?<eos> I had created this kind of dark fantasy in my mind about what it would be like if we ever saw each other again.<eos> How did it measure up?<eos> Is divorced enough for you?

- That was on both of us.<eos> This is good, because we're throwing all of our shit on the table to flop around where we can see it.<eos> But why would shit be flopping around?<eos> - Yeah. It probably should've been fish.<eos> Then it's a fish.<eos> The point is, is that we knew this wasn't gonna be easy.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm sorry for making you feel like the odd man out.<eos> Me, too.<eos> And I'm sorry for keeping the "girl-girl-girl" thing from you.

He has this absurd notion we're third-wheeling him.<eos> That he's our penis bridge to a more traditional lesbian relationship.<eos> I don't know, I mean, imagine I had a phase in my life where I was just like... you know, swimming in dicks.<eos> Apparently, three of her past five relationships have been with women.<eos> I didn't know about it. Might have been nice to - drop me a hint.<eos> - Mm-hmm. So, Jack has now officially proclaimed me a homosexual.<eos> This whole thing started when Ding and Dong here raced to the airport to stop me from going home to Colorado but just forgot to discuss what they'd do when they got me back.<eos> And don't even get me started - on the pumpkin spice fucking candles.<eos> - What?<eos> I thought you liked those.
I'm not running away to Brown University.<eos> Izzy tell you that?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You're still hanging out with Izzy.<eos> You guys are still fucking.<eos> I really am rebound girl.<eos> No, Nina.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Look, we ran into each other on campus. We had a cup of coffee so that I could download the Nina Martone user's manual.<eos> And then she threatened to wear my balls as earrings - if I ever hurt you.
It's really awesome.<eos> So, me, you, Carmen, Lori, Nina, shit ton of Chardonnay... this could get weird.<eos> I recommend you curb your enthusiasm.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Clomid time.<eos> - Whoa, you're still doing all that?<eos> - Yep. And I got to lay off the booze and the weed.<eos> - You must really want a kid.<eos> - I must.<eos> What about you?
How is that misogynistic?<eos> I mean, it sounds like a compliment, but it's really just like saying "fairer sex."<eos> Exactly, it's... it's like a thinly veiled prescription.<eos> You stay pretty and keep your shit together so I don't have to.<eos> Does it hurt? - Don't answer.<eos> Don't say it. Don't answer.<eos> - Does what hurt?<eos> You know, you two getting your heads so far up each other's asses.<eos> - What are you even talking about?<eos> - No, I'm telling you.
Not sure I'm getting quite as much out of it as you, but...<eos> Lori.<eos> Lori. You're forgiven.<eos> And you are loved.<eos> None of us will ever make you leave the sleepover.<eos> Ever.<eos> Oh, that was so good, Iz. So poignant.<eos> Poignant. - Poignant.<eos> - Oh, hey, Lori. - My babysitter just texted.<eos> - And... everyone forgives you, so...
In what version of the universe am I the bad guy?<eos> Uh, how about the version where the last words you said to us before you stormed out were "Ruby Shivani."<eos> Uh, maybe the version where you've been acting like a wounded Emo meddle score.<eos> Meanwhile, the real version in the real world consists of two lesbians, a happy gay couple, who just have this inconvenient dude who's like a fucking Goddamn beard around them all the time.<eos> Honestly, enough with the beard stuff.<eos> Was there any point in the last 30 minutes or so where I seemed gay to you?<eos> I'm in love with you.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'm in love with you and Emma.<eos> To be honest, maybe it's not you that I'm worried about.
Standing there, wearing that?<eos> Is this okay?<eos> Is it okay?<eos> It's really scary.<eos> And sexy. Has to be scary and sexy, not just scary.<eos> I meant scary in a sexy way, that's all.<eos> I'm gonna have to edit this out.<eos> Okay, you know what, fuck you! You're not even trying.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I was laughing with you, honey. No, no, no!
Fine.<eos> Yeah, but this... this place isn't polyamorous or bisexual.<eos> It's, like, clearly for avowed lesbians.<eos> Well, there weren't any bisexual or polyamorous lunch places on Yelp.<eos> Cut me some slack.<eos> That's true.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Izzy's not gay-gay.<eos> I know that for sure.<eos> Wait a second, but you're not for sure about you? Is that what you're saying?
I'm so fucking scared, Carm.<eos> I feel like...<eos> I feel like I've just been, you know, drifting along and playing along. And then this alarm went off, and I woke up in the middle of my life.<eos> I have no fucking clue who I am or... or what I want, like, sexually, professionally... or reproductively.<eos> Damn.<eos> Wow. You're gonna give me a nervous breakdown.<eos> You think I'm having a nervous breakdown?<eos> You think that I'm so confused and guilt ridden that I'm driving myself over the edge?<eos> - Ah, you've wedged a lot of zany... - [Mobile ringing] Hairpin life turns into a very short period of time.<eos> - Maybe you're just dizzy. - Ugh, fuck.
CCK cleanse.<eos> Remember?<eos> You asked me to "hold you to it"?<eos> I did.<eos> CCK stands for cabbage, cayenne, and kale.<eos> And it's disgusting.<eos> That's legally poison.<eos> Told ya.<eos> It's good for you.<eos> So, what did Kylie say to give you the glossy-eyed phone-gasm that's happening?
All right. So... This is what we've got to work with.<eos> This is what we have to work with, yes.<eos> - You guys are not helping. - What's the venue?<eos> It's an Italian place she picked out.<eos> It's called, uh, "Ask For Luigi"?<eos> No, that's definitely a date restaurant. Mm.<eos> Pretty much every chick that goes there comes out with a baby bump and a ring.<eos> That's not what's happening here.<eos> You do know anxiety restricts your blood flow?<eos> I'm sure Gabe here can hook you up with some of his extra-strength Viagra for chronic impotence.
Yeah, it's pretty charming...<eos> No, it's annoying as shit.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> I don't think that's the consensus. Both:<eos> Uh, yeah, it is.<eos> Yeah, I got to go with the girls on this on.<eos> You just talk sparingly, and you never break eye contact.<eos> Like dragon eyes.<eos> Uh, conversely, that sounds a bit rape-y.<eos> Worked on you.
Well, Gabriel told his sister Marina, who told Bailey Meyer, who told me, so I Facebooked Gabriel and he says it's true.<eos> They're, like, best buds now.<eos> Jack tells him everything.<eos> Really?<eos> Like what?<eos> Give me something.<eos> You mean something like... Jack has a big, romantic dinner with an ex-girlfriend tonight?<eos> Hey!<eos> Not the weed!<eos> Just helping you with your cleanse.
Treasure found.<eos> Hot Pockets.<eos> Which ice cream pairs best?<eos> Salted Caramel.<eos> ♪ It's a ♪ ♪ Hot Pocket, nuke it and see ♪<eos> That... That was... quite a performance.<eos> I thought that you were...<eos> Okay.<eos> You're obviously stoned.<eos> So who made this moment possible for you?
The mosquitos don't bother you out here?<eos> I'm a little scared right now.<eos> We could run.<eos> I want to run.<eos> Get it... you're our surrogate, all filled up with my eggs and Jack's sperm.<eos> - It's brilliant.<eos> - Right?<eos> And the very concept of grandchildren will surge so many endorphins to their sixty-something frontal lobes, they'll basically be stoned the whole time. Mm-hmm.<eos> They'll forget all about Mexicans and gays and the government's imminent seizure of their guns.<eos> Don't you like the plan?
My professional recommendation would be surrogacy.<eos> Do you think we're making a mistake sending Izzy away every time she's an inconvenience?<eos> How do we explain her presence here?<eos> I have an idea.<eos> - You're our surrogate.<eos> - As your surrogate, why would I be living in your guest room?<eos> Because you're uneducated and poor.<eos> If you tell Lori about this, ... I will<eos> You'll break my legs? Eat my face?<eos> So who made this moment possible for you?
Oh, is your shift done?<eos> You.<eos> No, bro.<eos> Man, come on.<eos> I'm really working on staying out of people's shit.<eos> - Since when?<eos> - Since, like... since...<eos> You know, not yet, but it's something I probably should start.<eos> Just spill it.<eos> Does the name Michelle mean anything to you?
They're saying we're finally gonna have a grandchild.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Is that true?<eos> - It'll really be Emma's baby?<eos> A Seaver?<eos> Well, technically.<eos> I am so proud of you.<eos> Also graduated at the top of my class, designed a bunch of cool buildings, and just made partner at my firm, but, um... thanks, Mom.<eos> Come here, you.<eos> Thanks to you, - the Seaver name lives on. - Oh.
Say whatever you want.<eos> You are chemically inclined to provoke, and I have to stop making a federal fucking case out of it. Where are you from, what do you want, and how did you get inside this hollow thing that was once my mother?<eos> I love you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Come on, I have said "I love you" before.<eos> True, but let's contextualize, shall we?<eos> Last night you literally dragged me to the Trakarsky house, your eyes blazing with the fury of a thousand suns.<eos> I shouldn't have done that.<eos> I shouldn't have gone over there. I stirred up shit between those three again.<eos> Keeping it between me and you, that would have been the un-assholey thing to do.

Thank you for being honest.<eos> [Whispering] You're welcome.<eos> And you're grounded for another month.<eos> What?<eos> I thought we were having some kind of "Aha" moment here.<eos> - We are.<eos> - So why?<eos> Well, because you made a promise to Izzy and then you broke that promise.<eos> That makes you an asshole.<eos> I'm grounding you for being an asshole, because as stated, I love you.
Well, because you made a promise to Izzy and then you broke that promise.<eos> That makes you an asshole.<eos> I'm grounding you for being an asshole, because as stated, I love you.<eos> This is all very weird.<eos> I know, but in a good way.<eos> It's amazing how much of my cookbook works in that RV's little kitchen.<eos> Everything tastes better when this girl makes it.<eos> It's like she's got some secret spice or something.<eos> It's called love, Harold. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Emma, did I not give you a copy of my cookbook?
Glad you all find my lack of mundane masculine acumen so amusing.<eos> - [Laughter] - "Masculine acumen"?<eos> Who talks like that?<eos> I'm not laughing.<eos> No.<eos> Okay, after 100 years of marriage, that still blinded me in one eye.<eos> When did drugs become so scary?<eos> When did they stop being kind and happy?<eos> You know, I'm thinking maybe when we added a mortgage and a couple needy little humans to the mix.<eos> We're grown-ups for the rest of our lives. Oh, my God, that's fucking terrifying. Okay, so I'm just gonna... help you.
Tell me the truth. Did Andy dump you real hard so now you just run around cock blocking him?<eos> Just give it to me straight.<eos> I'm not gonna tell anyone.<eos> Already tried that, rando chick.<eos> You can't handle the truth.<eos> Try me again.<eos> Dude, we dated for like four months.<eos> It's not like he was the love of my life, all right?<eos> I'm not wearing a locket full of his semen.<eos> I was just trying to help you out, you know?
This has been fun, I think.<eos> More Yahtzee?<eos> Izzy: You've reached Izzy's voice-mail.<eos> Now text like everybody else.<eos> [Beeps] God damn it, Iz, answer your fucking phone.<eos> I want to hunt and slay and doing it alone just screams<eos> "My self-esteem issues, your soundproof basement.<eos> Let's do this thing."<eos> - Okay, call me. - [Cellphone beeps]<eos> Oh, let's, uh... let's get some clothes on you.
Okay, but only if you say your daughter's name... her full married name.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Let's hear it.<eos> Emma Trakarsky.<eos> Well, you didn't make my daughter gay-ish, but you did make her a Pollack.<eos> Okay, well, that's incredibly offensive, but not surprising, so let's do this.<eos> You're a good man, Jack.<eos> - I am? - You are.<eos> Huh. But I'm gonna tell you something very important, and I want you to listen real close.
Just take a break or something?<eos> So... on a scale of 1 to 10, how mad are you?<eos> Well, you stood me up on our "Come on, dummy, we both know this is a fucking date."<eos> Right.<eos> But at least you did it in person, so...<eos> I don't know, like, a six.<eos> - Six?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Sounds reasonable.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, so instead of having you killed, I'm just gonna kick you in the balls
Okay, let's go.<eos> You got to pay your tab there, Drunky McSlurry Bum.<eos> Put it on Uncle Jack's tab.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Make him pay for it.<eos> He's done... He's done enough to me.<eos> Who's this ho?<eos> Do we have a problem?<eos> Oh, no, not at all.<eos> You say one more word, I'm gonna punch you as hard as I can in the face.
I'd do anything for you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Somebody's perky this morning.<eos> Yeah. You know, just feeling lighter.<eos> Letting all that bad stuff... go.<eos> Sounds like a poop thing. It's not.<eos> But anyway, I have a feeling that you are gonna have a super-terrific day, neighbor.<eos> Are you on something?<eos> Okay, well, um...<eos> Thanks, Lori. You have a super-terrific day, too.
Southeast corner.<eos> Come on in, Emma.<eos> Put 'er there, partner.<eos> Uh, what's going on?<eos> Well, I did a... a little maneuvering.<eos> You're heading up the Hamilton Theater Project again.<eos> Press release for your promotion goes out this afternoon.<eos> Uh, can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> Of course.<eos> I was going to present this to you at the party, but...
Uh, can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> Of course.<eos> I was going to present this to you at the party, but...<eos> You're putting on quite a show, aren't you?<eos> What the fuck is that supposed to mean?<eos> My neighbor, Lori Matherfield, she was clenching in such a big, fat, juicy secret this morning...<eos> I thought she was gonna explode.<eos> She's gonna tell me.<eos> Fine, if you really must ruin it.<eos> What, you mean expose this bullshit piece of theater starring you as the magnanimous senior partner?
We lose it.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> And I fire you so fucking hard, Trakarsky.<eos> Ooh, I'm scared.<eos> And before the door hits your ass, I initiate the first of 100 calls to make sure you never work in this town again.<eos> Stop, I'm gonna piss my pants.<eos> You play it as cool as you want, but... we both know we're stuck with each other.<eos> Now, why don't we go back to your new office, put on our big-girl smiles... Oh, I can't.<eos> I'm meeting a friend.<eos> Um, but I will give you my decision as soon as I get back.
- We've hit a snag a bump in the road... turbulence.<eos> Sir, I can gate check that for you.<eos> - It'll fit.<eos> - No, sir, it won't.<eos> I'm telling you, it's gonna fit.<eos> - I got it up here fine last flight.<eos> - I'll rephrase<eos> I'm going to gate check your bag for you now, sir.<eos> Please find your seat.<eos> So, you know... you better buckle up.
- Papa.<eos> - It's okay, go sit back down.<eos> But I reserve the right to switch out mid-flight, because Mama's gonna need a glass of wine.<eos> Or three.<eos> You guys weren't able to sit together?<eos> Like I said, last minute.<eos> Well, do you want to?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I make so many efforts.<eos> Did you or did you not call my mom back when she left you a message two weeks ago?
I should be asking you if you're following me.<eos> Don't flatter yourself.<eos> Well, it is a little suspicious.<eos> One minute, some guy with a beard's sitting there, and next thing I know, there you are. Hmm.<eos> Flight crew, please start readying the cabin.<eos> Of course.<eos> Might not be the worst thing in the world.<eos> - What's not?<eos> - Three whole days... far from home... no one around to bother us.<eos> I told you, we're done.
What are you...?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Well, you said to come in here.<eos> - No, I didn't. - Yeah, you did.<eos> You did that thing with your eyes.<eos> - Yeah, where you look at me all... you know, then you came in here, so I figured you wanted me to come in here, too.<eos> I did nothing with my eyes.<eos> I swear it looked like...<eos> There's no room in here.<eos> Well, I do need to talk to you.
Yes, you were, and I think I need to be clear, too.<eos> You and I... this is something.<eos> And I can't keep ignoring that.<eos> - Well, you have to.<eos> - I can't.<eos> Not my problem.<eos> - Can you?<eos> - What?<eos> - Ignore it. - Yes.<eos> - I don't believe you.
- Yeah.<eos> - Y-yeah.<eos> - Was it bad?<eos> I mean, it was... we crashed and got lost.<eos> People died.<eos> It wasn't great.<eos> What about your plane crash?<eos> Did anyone die or lose a limb?<eos> You know that's how Arizona lost her leg.<eos> Okay, I'm definitely not telling you about mine now.
It wasn't great.<eos> What about your plane crash?<eos> Did anyone die or lose a limb?<eos> You know that's how Arizona lost her leg.<eos> Okay, I'm definitely not telling you about mine now.<eos> It can't compare.<eos> It's not a contest.<eos> Come on.<eos> No.<eos> I told you mine.
You guys seem pretty chummy.<eos> - You're one to talk.<eos> How long were you wrapping your flight attendant's arm?<eos> Oh, her name's Candace.<eos> It's what I do when I board a plane.<eos> I always ask the crews their name.<eos> - It's a respect thing.<eos> Also, it usually gets me free drinks.<eos> What was your plane crash like?<eos> I told you.
I mean, I get it better.<eos> Well, there's nothing to get.<eos> I mean, it makes sense, you know, all the self-sacrifice.<eos> You don't want to lose this one, too.<eos> Is it so crazy that I would put someone else's happiness before mine?<eos> No, but, I mean, it's not completely practical in the long run.<eos> I mean, at some point, you have to think about the things that are gonna make you happy, too.<eos> And you think you're it?<eos> Well, you haven't exactly been backing away from me.<eos> I told you...
Then what?<eos> For months now.<eos> Look... You try to stay away.<eos> Maybe you even want to stay away.<eos> But you don't.<eos> You never do.<eos> A week ago, you called it quits.<eos> An hour ago, we're having sex in the bathroom.<eos> Will you stop it, please?<eos> I will respect whatever you decide, okay?
For months now.<eos> Look...

I just want to...<eos> I want to move forward.<eos> I want to live my life 'cause I'm still here.<eos> I've still got one, and so do you.<eos> Don't look at me like that, like I don't know what I'm talking about 'cause you know I do.<eos> That could have been you in that seat with no seat belt.<eos> Yeah, but it wasn't.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm just fine.<eos> And so are you.
So, Nathan and I...<eos> We are becoming a couple.<eos> I think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But you're my sister, and I wanted to tell you, because I don't want it to come between us.
So, Nathan and I...<eos> We are becoming a couple.<eos> I think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But you're my sister, and I wanted to tell you, because I don't want it to come between us.<eos> Oh, she's gonna hate me.<eos> That's a good point.<eos> It has taken me a long time to tell you.
Come on.<eos> And in the end, what really matters is that we care about each other, and that will never change.<eos> How's that sound?<eos> Forced.<eos> Well, it sounds forced because I'm a horrible person.<eos> You could use the plane.<eos> Near-death experience...<eos> that's a good excuse. Lie?<eos> Your advice to me is to lie?<eos> Planes have taken a lot from you.
And in the end, what really matters is that we care about each other, and that will never change.<eos> How's that sound?<eos> Forced.<eos> Well, it sounds forced because I'm a horrible person.<eos> You could use the plane.<eos> Near-death experience...<eos> that's a good excuse. Lie?<eos> Your advice to me is to lie?<eos> Planes have taken a lot from you.<eos> When have they ever given you something good?
Look, if you don't want to lie, just be vague.<eos> No details.<eos> She's an adult.<eos> She can take it.<eos> Less is more.<eos> What if she hates me?<eos> She's not gonna hate you.<eos> And I called it off, and I kept it off until I couldn't anymore, and I'm really very, very sorry.<eos> That's the one.<eos> I have been looking everywhere for you.
Crowd not big enough?<eos> Richard's not sitting with Catherine.<eos> You need to leave that man alone.<eos> I'm moving on to Catherine.<eos> Their marriage is not your lane.<eos> Your lane is over here with me.<eos> Stay in it.<eos> I mean it, Miranda.<eos> You're right.<eos> My lane is with you in this marriage. - I am blessed.
My lane is with you in this marriage. - I am blessed.<eos> - All right, then.<eos> I have also been blessed with the ability to change lanes, because my car belongs to me, and I take it where I want to go.<eos> Leave no lane untraveled.<eos> That's big talk for somebody who's scared of Catherine Avery.<eos> Wh...<eos> Please.<eos> - I am not afraid of Ca...<eos> - Dr. Bailey?<eos> You made me late.
- from unwashed fruit or...<eos> - Ugh. Just get them out.<eos> - The surgery... it's extremely simple.<eos> Um, DeLuca, let's book an O.R.<eos> Mm-hmm. - Uh, Dennis? - Hey.<eos> You can accompany her to the pre-op room.<eos> Dennis?<eos> I can't. I, uh...<eos> I just have to, uh...<eos> I got to make a phone call and let your mom know that you're okay.
No, it wasn't just the plane.<eos> It happened before that.<eos> When?<eos> When?<eos> Before Amelia and Owen's wedding.<eos> But it started before I even knew you liked him, and as soon as you told me you liked him, I called it off.<eos> We talked about it!<eos> - I...<eos> - You let me go on and on!<eos> I was going to tell you, and then your mother died, and then I just couldn't.

I was going to tell you, and then your mother died, and then I just couldn't.<eos> I didn't want to hurt you, and Nathan didn't want to hurt you.<eos> No.<eos> This isn't about Nathan.<eos> It's you!<eos> I trusted you to be honest with me, when even my mother lied to me, and now she's dead.<eos> I thought I could count on you to tell me the truth.<eos> But you've been lying this whole time.<eos> I was trying to do the right thing.<eos> Well, you didn't.
Come here.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt you.<eos> That's the last thing I would ever want.<eos> Because I care about you more than anything.<eos> Hey.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, no matter how mad you are, how much you want to shut me out, know this...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What does it look like I'm doing?<eos> Didn't Amelia tell you? She's waiting in the car.
Okay.<eos> So, no matter how mad you are, how much you want to shut me out, know this...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What does it look like I'm doing?<eos> Didn't Amelia tell you? She's waiting in the car.<eos> The sitter's upstairs.<eos> We're going out.<eos> Well, if you want to go out so bad, why don't you call Riggs?<eos> I'm busy.<eos> I want to go out with you.
I want to go out with you.<eos> Meredith.<eos> Stop.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.<eos> I am very sorry that I screwed up and I hurt you.<eos> But you're my sister.<eos> And I'm sure as hell not losing you over a guy.<eos> Please come out with me.<eos> ...you are my sister, whether you like it or not...
...and I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> We named that one Geraldine.<eos> Oh, look at you. So silly.<eos> You are just too much.<eos> Edwards was right in her element there.<eos> And you right along with her. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - That thing is awful.<eos> - I'm telling you, it was like...
I don't know.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Forget I asked. You like her.<eos> Nope.<eos> I'm not doing this.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hang on, hang on.<eos> You're a good guy.<eos> Y-You want to let that go, okay?<eos> You made a grand gesture, but she still hasn't said anything to you, has she?
We've seen everything, Holly.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Uh, well, I've got a giant, inoperable heart tumor.<eos> Holy...<eos> And, uh, you know, you can just ignore that.<eos> It's just something I have.<eos> Is it sharp, like someone stabbing you really hard, or throbbing... like a ball bouncing against your head?<eos> It just hurts.<eos> Sometimes I feel like I've been spinning.<eos> Like you're dizzy?
The embolization went well.<eos> I was able to stop the bleeding on your spleen.<eos> We'll just have to monitor you for the next 24 hours, and you should be okay.<eos> All right.<eos> You know, I should've just turned on the light.<eos> I didn't want to wake him, you know?<eos> Well, that was polite.<eos> No, it was because I didn't want to talk to him.<eos> He's the kind of guy who always says,<eos> "I'll tell you something," before he tells you something.
I can't get together tonight.<eos> Okay.<eos> No big deal.<eos> I just... I have a patient who's in labor with a baby with CDH, and I'm gonna be here all night.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Of course.<eos> I understand.<eos> Just...<eos> I was looking forward to it, is all.<eos> I look for you.
I was looking forward to it, is all.<eos> I look for you.<eos> All day.<eos> When I, uh, when I turn a corner or I pass by one of the scan rooms.<eos> Uh, getting on an elevator.<eos> I hope that maybe I'll just catch a glimpse of you.<eos> And when I... see you every time, it makes me catch my breath... just a little.<eos> And my heart speeds up.<eos> My palms sweat.<eos> Seeing you... talking to you, and... touching you.
I'm so sorry.<eos> - Honey.<eos> - Why are you sorry?<eos> I promise I tried, I did what they said, and I prayed and I prayed, but it didn't work.<eos> God didn't help me.<eos> Can you help me, Dr. Karev?<eos> Can you fix my eyes?<eos> All right, take a deep breath.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> I promise, Liam, I'm gonna do everything I can to help you.
Jo?<eos> Uh, listen, do you want to get a beer?<eos> Ugh. I have a teratoma excision at 7:00 I have to read up on, but tomorrow?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, sure, tomorrow.<eos> - Hey, Jo?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> I'm good, actually.<eos> Talking to you is probably one of the only good things to come out of this year.
Not in my bed.<eos> - Okay, I understand.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Just tell me where to go.<eos> Down the stairs and out through the back door.<eos> Okay, I'll be quiet as a mouse.<eos> It's just that the problems are suddenly manageable.<eos> You feel so good, you wonder if it's real.<eos> And if I've learned anything I can tell you... it is.
02 and crike kit, please?<eos> Is she dying?<eos> Mommy, is she dying?<eos> She's choking on something.<eos> Okay.<eos> Move.<eos> Move!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> - You're okay.
Is she dying?<eos> Mommy, is she dying?<eos> She's choking on something.<eos> Okay.<eos> Move.<eos> Move!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> - You're okay.<eos> You're okay.
I'll, uh, tell him to come by.<eos> - What was that about?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Okay, uh...<eos> Did you treat a choking baby this morning?<eos> What, are we not speaking now? Yes!<eos> Why?<eos> Uh, baby's in the PICU for observation.<eos> She looks good, but the parents want to speak to you.
But Grey wants him immobile for 24 hours.<eos> - Guys, maybe it wasn't love, all right?<eos> - Dr. Avery.<eos> It's not romance we're talking about here.<eos> It was emergency sex, and they were just too damn horny to remember the parking brake.<eos> That's super cynical.<eos> What is wrong with you people? - Seriously.<eos> - Wow.<eos> You should let him come see her.<eos> You should figure it out. Why?
I feel really sick.<eos> Because you think the kids will like him, and then it'll fall apart and he'll be gone and the kids will be sad.<eos> - No, it's not that. - It's that.<eos> I know this because I'm the queen of thinking this way.<eos> I always think everybody's gonna die.<eos> Yeah, but you're crazy.<eos> I'm just... sick.<eos> Derek is dead.<eos> Maggie is fine.<eos> There is nothing in your way but you.
I can't. I can't!<eos> It's locked.<eos> We're in lockdown.<eos> Why?<eos> Because a rapist is in the hospital.<eos> What, we're trapped in here?<eos> We're trapped in here.<eos> - So, and you're sure it's her?<eos> - It's her.<eos> The Army won't tell you unless they're certain.
Lord, don't make me have to tell Catherine Avery I burned her hospital to the ground.<eos> Edwards?<eos> Stephanie!<eos> Edwards?<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Stephanie?<eos> Maggie.<eos> - Hey, take this to Kepner outside.<eos> - Right away.<eos> I've been texting you.
Okay. So, I'm looking for this little girl.<eos> She's 8, she's super-smart, she keeps ditching her parents.<eos> - Look for her.<eos> - All right.<eos> Hey.<eos> What do we have?<eos> CCU patient, one-day status post.<eos> CABG. She's stable.<eos> She just needs to stay on her... heparin infusion...<eos> Are you okay?
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, it's...<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Not a big fan of fire, you know? It's...<eos> If I'm being honest, this is, uh... kinda my worst nightmare, actually.<eos> Well, just, like, imagine that it's a parking-lot barbecue.<eos> The smoke.<eos> The burning burgers...<eos> All right.<eos> You know what? Just take a minute, okay?
Skooch out.<eos> Skooch out this way.<eos> Don't bend, don't bend, don't bend.<eos> Go this direction.<eos> Keep going.<eos> There we go.<eos> Okay!<eos> Get you out of here, okay?<eos> Hang on.<eos> Let me help you up.
Sir, we're looking for a missing girl.<eos> She's 8 years old.<eos> Her name is Erin.<eos> We've all got our eyes out for her. Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bovie.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's get her on a morphine drip.<eos> All right, you're gonna be all right.<eos> - We have been looking for you!
I ca...<eos> I can't get out of here without the card.<eos> We can go down.<eos> We can get through the fire.<eos> We can make it.<eos> So we're stuck?<eos> No.<eos> No, we're not stuck.<eos> We are...<eos> We're gonna sit right here and put this over our heads, and we're gonna be just fine, I promise you. Come on.
That's pulling the covers over your head.<eos> My mom said when things get scary, you don't do that.<eos> You turn on the light so the scary goes away.<eos> Listen, your mom is right. Usually.<eos> But I'm a doctor and I know that in this case...<eos> This blanket is our best chance, okay?<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Let me help you.
All right, let's get her on a bed right away.<eos> All right, her adrenaline faded.<eos> Pain's probably set in.<eos> Yeah, it's the body's way of protecting itself from the pain.<eos> - Got her head? - Yep.<eos> All right, okay.<eos> Okay, let's get back to work.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You okay?
- Got her head? - Yep.<eos> All right, okay.<eos> Okay, let's get back to work.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, I'm sorry if I scared you.
- Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, I'm sorry if I scared you.<eos> I'm... I was fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It's just, you're gonna need to breathe.<eos> When I... when I tell you what I have to tell you, so... take a deep breath for me so I know that you can.
I mean, have they confirmed that?<eos> Apparently so.<eos> I'm... not really sure how it works.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> They're taking her to Madigan Army Medical Center.<eos> Owen and Amelia are on their way now.<eos> Tell, uh, Pierce I... I had to go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> Are... Are you okay?
There.<eos> Look. See that?<eos> What if it doesn't have any keys?<eos> I bet Mia knows how to hot-wire.<eos> I don't trust her.<eos> Plus, she's kinda cuffed right now.<eos> Yeah, I'll talk to Connor.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> I used to bring you to this mall when you were a baby.<eos> Something about the ambient noise helped put you to sleep.

Remember?
- Because I don't know what's gonna happen out there, and the more people we are, the safer we'll be.<eos> No, I mean why would I do that?<eos> They're prisoners.<eos> No, I know, but these are extraordinary circumstances.<eos> I think we need to help each other now.<eos> I'm happy to help, but an extraordinary situation seems like a great argument to not let dangerous people run in the streets.<eos> She's not dangerous.<eos> She's just loud.<eos> This woman is wanted for murder.<eos> You didn't think about that, did you?
There's a store a little further down.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Meet you back here.<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> I need to go.<eos> My Mom thinks I'm...<eos> Just give me a few seconds, okay?<eos> Hear me out.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.
I need to go.<eos> My Mom thinks I'm...<eos> Just give me a few seconds, okay?<eos> Hear me out.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> Want to go?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'll let you go.<eos> Soon as you've let me talk.<eos> I didn't hurt you, and I didn't touch you that night.
Want to go?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'll let you go.<eos> Soon as you've let me talk.<eos> I didn't hurt you, and I didn't touch you that night.<eos> I need you to believe me.<eos> I don't.<eos> I liked you.<eos> I stood up for you, and I stood up for your friend.<eos> I don't know how else to prove it to you.
He saw you.<eos> He saw me do what?<eos> He saw you take me upstairs.<eos> He saw me passed out.<eos> And then what?<eos> And then what?<eos> He didn't see shit, because I took you upstairs... I took off your shoes... and I put a blanket on you, and I left you there alone to sleep it off.<eos> - Let me touch your hand.<eos> - No.<eos> I want to show you that nothing happens.

I've seen God.<eos> Mrs. Raven, you are in shock.<eos> That wasn't God.<eos> Oh, I'm not talking about your God.<eos> What's that?<eos> I told you to get blankets, not toys.<eos> Jay was there.<eos> Did he...<eos> I'm okay.<eos> What did he say to you?
Guys, no, we need to stay together here.<eos> Well, why the hell do we have rules, if they don't apply to everybody?<eos> Come on. Look, this is for everyone's safety.<eos> Everyone?<eos> Why are you so paranoid?<eos> Alex, tell her I haven't done anything.<eos> - Don't you dare.<eos> - Calm down.<eos> - Leave her alone!<eos> - Calm down. Tell her I didn't hurt you. - I, uh...
Start a large-bore I.V., and run L.R. wide open.<eos> Is he gonna be okay?<eos> I'm gonna work on him right now.<eos> Yeah, but that's not what I asked.<eos> I'll be back as soon as I can.<eos> He's gonna be fine.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> But here's what I know.<eos> If he dies, it's because of you.
He's gonna be fine.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> But here's what I know.<eos> If he dies, it's because of you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm not the one who shot him.<eos> Yeah, but you're the one that didn't shoot.<eos> You can't blame me for not just killing people.<eos> Yeah, but you are killing people, and Bryan could die because of you.
You're thinking of "Wuthering Heights," and nobody jumps off a cliff.<eos> Okay, well, then explain it in a nonliterary fashion.<eos> I write about owls, remember?<eos> You know who I was before I met you.<eos> Do I?<eos> I was dating guys in your brother's crowd.<eos> The bad guys.<eos> Bad guys were very popular or so I remember.<eos> And I still am that girl, but I'm also not, 'cause I met you.<eos> And if I hadn't, I'd still be partying, going from guy to guy, certainly wouldn't have been a teacher, 'cause no one... no one thought I had anything to offer... but you.
He took the knife, and he cut his own arm.<eos> You remember?<eos> And he kept saying, "It's just blood.<eos> It's just blood."<eos> And then you grabbed me, and we ran away.<eos> I regret that now, by the way.<eos> And I was so scared afterwards, and you just held me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's, uh...<eos> That's when you grew the vagina.
You know, when we met...<eos> When we met, I was weak.<eos> I'm not anymore.<eos> When we met, you needed me.<eos> I still need you.<eos> I just don't need you to save me.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> East wing.<eos> What happened to you?
Previously on "The Mist"...<eos> I cannot do what you ask of me.<eos> I can.<eos> You must repent.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Please!<eos> No.<eos> Let me help you die.
You're Jonah.<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I went to my mother's house, wanted to run away.<eos> And my mom was there.<eos> Or you know.<eos> And she wanted to help me die, and I didn't want to, and I was so surprised that I didn't, 'cause I have nothing to live for.<eos> Except...<eos> Except maybe... maybe I do.<eos> I believe you, and... I want to be someone you can believe in.
- I trust myself.<eos> You're 16. You don't know who...<eos> What are your qualifications, then?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> For knowing whom I should trust.<eos> I'm your mom.<eos> That's my qualification, and I will kick him out of the loading dock.<eos> They might be crazy out there, but he'll be safe. - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I mean, if it's safe, then I'm sure you don't mind if I crash out there, if I go with him.
I wanted him to beg me to stop, but he didn't.<eos> I, um...<eos> I took my dick out.<eos> I asked him, "Was this what you want?"<eos> And I pissed on him.<eos> He never told anyone.<eos> I respected that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I'm so sorry.<eos> I forgive you.
I-I'm so sorry.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> My God.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, just make them tighter.<eos> Make them tighter.<eos> Look, no matter what happens, you don't let me out of these things, okay, no matter how bad it gets.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wanted to thank you, Link.
I forgive you.<eos> My God.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, just make them tighter.<eos> Make them tighter.<eos> Look, no matter what happens, you don't let me out of these things, okay, no matter how bad it gets.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wanted to thank you, Link.<eos> I want to thank you for your sacrifice.

Jonah!<eos> Jonah!<eos> You're lying.<eos> No, I'm...<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I... I swear I'm not.<eos> I'm not.<eos> If you know something, tell me.<eos> When you release me, I'll tell you.
What if you're both wrong?<eos> - What if it's...<eos> - If Thomas is right, then we'll die out there.<eos> But if one of us is right, if one of us survives, then you will know who to follow.<eos> Then that person can save you.<eos> I would like a few moments alone so I can pray.<eos> Then we should begin.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> In the name of the Father, of the son, and of the Holy Spirit, amen.<eos> Be with me now, in this hour of need, I pray to you.
I'm not.<eos> Then prove it.<eos> Let me in, and I will.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you see, you see, you are just like all the rest of them, huh?<eos> You try and trick me.<eos> Look me in the eye.<eos> Look me in the eye, Nash!<eos> Look me in the eye, and tell me you don't see evil.<eos> I don't believe you.
You need a shower.<eos> You smell like shit.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> All right, you... you walk in.<eos> You go to the other side of the room.<eos> Let him go.<eos> We don't have to do this.<eos> What else is there to do than to fight the evil?<eos> What else is there in life?<eos> It's in you.

Everyone who's gone into the mist has died, except her, except Alex.<eos> The mist didn't want her.<eos> Shelley, we talked about this.<eos> Something's wrong with them.<eos> When did all this start?<eos> It started when she lied, when she lied about being raped.<eos> I think we all need to calm down, get some sleep.<eos> I think we need to find a solution.<eos> Unless you all want to die here.<eos> You okay?

You know, three-hour...<eos> How long you think they were?<eos> - Twenty-four-hour days.<eos> - Twenty-four-hour days.<eos> - And one slave flipped.<eos> - Lost it.<eos> He lost his shit. He was, like, "Fuck!"<eos> This Pharaoh got me working like... - "All these niggas around me." - Yeah.<eos> - That's excellent.<eos> - Oh, thank you.
We're twinsies!<eos> You can't do that!<eos> Well, I asked you where you got it, and you told me.<eos> I thought you were just curious!<eos> I didn't think you'd go buy the same jacket.<eos> We're around each other all the time.<eos> So now I have to ask you when you're going to be wearing the jacket?<eos> Maybe? Or you can just embrace the whole twinsies situation?<eos> Stop saying twinsies.<eos> I got you a coffee.
You want to do it way more often and way better?<eos> I'm in!<eos> Wow. That was easy.<eos> Thanks, Barry.<eos> Those earrings are really nice.<eos> Where'd you get them?<eos> These?<eos> I got them at this awesome store.<eos> It's called:<eos> "Fuck You, I'm Not Telling You Where I Buy My Stuff Anymore."
You haven't gone down on me in two months!<eos> That's a problem!<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> I want you to go down on me!<eos> Right here?<eos> Right now?<eos> In the middle of the store?<eos> Stop joking.<eos> I'm serious!<eos> I blow you all the time!
It's not going to lick itself!<eos> Excuse me, could you please stop talking about your vagina to the entire world?<eos> My kids are with me, and they know ASL.<eos> Vagina! Vagina! Vagina!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Look, if we have a problem, you can talk to me about it in a normal way.<eos> You don't have to confront me in the middle of a store.<eos> You know what?<eos> Just go ahead and pay for the gift, and I'll meet you outside.<eos> I can't talk to you right now.
- Missy.<eos> - I'm Jake.<eos> She a friend of yours?<eos> Yeah, yeah, we came here together.<eos> Oh, oh, I'm sorry, no, no, not like, like, together-together, but in a... the same car together.<eos> Just as friends, yeah.<eos> We, um, we planned these simultaneous Tinder dates.<eos> Just promised to have each other's backs, in case things got a little awkward, we could just slide in and save each other.<eos> Except, um, yeah, my date stood me up.<eos> Don't say I never gave you anything.

Which room might I find your paramour?<eos> Tinder date.<eos> Room B14.<eos> (quietly):<eos> I'd take salmonella over a supernatural disease any day.<eos> Well, just because Crane's here doesn't mean it's definitely supernatural.<eos> I mean, there are dozens of biological explanations for these sort of symptoms.<eos> Trust me, it's monster flu.<eos> (demonic voice): I hear your call.<eos> I will join you.
Alex, she's infected.<eos> She ran off down the tunnels.<eos> - What is going on? - She watched the video an hour ago.<eos> She is burning up.<eos> If she's in the tunnels, she's entered a maze.<eos> - She could emerge anywhere in the city. - (ringtone plays)<eos> Alex, where the hell are you?<eos> Don't try to come after me.<eos> If you want to help, just find a cure.<eos> Alex, we can do that with you here.
By the time the team arrived, Wilson had been consumed.<eos> Master Wells.<eos> No.<eos> No, not this time.<eos> No, not today.<eos> Not Alex.<eos> (distorted voice):<eos> You must burn for me.<eos> You must join the eternal flame.<eos> I am ready to burn with you.
A good man name August Corbin showed me this ritual.<eos> He wanted to help guide me, to show me that even when life feels like it's spinning out of control, I can always find a way back.<eos> But what if I choose the wrong one?<eos> There is no wrong choice.<eos> All of these paths have value.<eos> Just listen to your heart and you'll choose true.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> When I did this ceremony, I picked the crossbow.<eos> Chose the destiny of a warrior.<eos> But the bowl means that the path laid out before you, should you choose to walk it, is that of an oracle.
But in the end... power can never remain hidden.<eos> Not to those deserving enough to wield it.<eos> (bones crack) (distorted): You are not deserving!<eos> Malcolm, I've secured the third Talisman.<eos> I'll see you in the morning.<eos> "Don't fight the pain.<eos> "Surrender to it."<eos> - (snarls) - You told me that once.<eos> Remember?<eos> I learned so much from you and your friends in Hell.
Very good.<eos> I should like an opportunity to get a better measure of the man.<eos> Whilst Agent Thomas and I have a chat with Mr. Dreyfuss, perhaps you could divine what it was he sought from the Smithsonian.<eos> You are, after all, our artifacts expert.<eos> I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but...<eos> He was talking to me.<eos> Yeah, I knew that.<eos> Mr. Dreyfuss is just wrapping up a presentation for our Young Entrepreneurs Program.<eos> It's so inspiring how much he gives back.<eos> Ansel, Ansel, I'm telling you, Th-the pull-down on page two, it just... it keeps crashing, it keeps... (sighs)
Here.<eos> All right. All right, all right.<eos> I can't reach Diana or Crane.<eos> - That's not good.<eos> - Hopefully, it just means they're somewhere without a signal.<eos> I got it. Got it, got it, got it. Okay.<eos> So, sigils are symbols that are activated by saying a spell, right?<eos> Now, what if you could sever the symbol from the spell?<eos> That, of course, led me to John Dee, who specialized in Hermetic languages.<eos> And I don't even have to tell you, deciphering all of that Enoch...
And he's taken the Philosopher's Stone.<eos> How are the quesadillas coming?<eos> Not bad.<eos> You always burn the tortillas anyway.<eos> I like them crunchy.<eos> Yours.<eos> (groaning) How bad did you hurt yourself?<eos> Oh, the doctor said workout injuries like this, um, they're not so bad.<eos> Be better in a few days.<eos> Baby, I got to talk to you about something.
Yours.<eos> (groaning) How bad did you hurt yourself?<eos> Oh, the doctor said workout injuries like this, um, they're not so bad.<eos> Be better in a few days.<eos> Baby, I got to talk to you about something.<eos> You know Mr. Crane?<eos> Yeah. He's awesome.<eos> Yeah, he is awesome.<eos> He's also special.<eos> - What do you mean? - You remember how I told you when I was in the Marines sometimes I'd get chosen for special missions?
You helped him - when he really needed it.<eos> - Good, 'cause... I like Mr. Crane.<eos> And I want to help people, like you do.<eos> That's how you got hurt.<eos> You didn't get hurt working out.<eos> You got hurt stopping bad people from doing bad things.<eos> Mom, you can always tell me the truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have a deal.<eos> That's a relief, 'cause... there's something I got to tell you.
Damn, it's fast.<eos> What'd you see?<eos> Some kind of ancient archer.<eos> The Talisman must be right below us in this crypt.<eos> But we can't get down there with that thing taking potshots at us.<eos> We must have woke it by poking around with the Scepter.<eos> If it's some kind of guardian, it won't follow us if we retreat.<eos> If we all run in separate directions, we might confuse it long enough to get to safety.<eos> Or end up with arrows in our backs.<eos> Hey, you said you liked being in the field.
I ask if it bothers you, you just change the subject.<eos> I...<eos> Right. The war against evil is far from over.<eos> There are many more enemies to face, many more battles to be fought.<eos> This is a road we should not start down until Miss Jenny and the others are securely in position and ready to distract the Sphinx.<eos> Hey, topside, what's your 20? In position.<eos> I'll signal when I have contact.<eos> Hey, hold up.<eos> I will need you to hang back by the truck.<eos> So is this some of sort of pattern with you?
'Cause you went off solo to Despair's cave to rescue Crane, and then again to infiltrate Dreyfuss' building.<eos> Yeah. I'm just quicker and more mobile on my own.<eos> The plan, your plan, was to split the demon's focus.<eos> It's not about the plan, she just doesn't want to babysit.<eos> - We can handle ourselves.<eos> - Really?<eos> 'Cause I've had years of experience dealing with situations like this.<eos> We're not idiots, we get it.<eos> It's a tough game.<eos> People died playing, people that you really cared about.
Top of that list were you and Molly.<eos> - Mitch, I... - Nope.<eos> Before you say anything, just know that I think you're an amazing mom.<eos> I respect how hard you've had to work, and I don't want to mess that up.<eos> I just want to... want to take you out for pizza now and then.<eos> Maybe catch a movie.<eos> Or just sit around all afternoon watching cartoons.<eos> I mean, you know me, I love cartoons.<eos> I am immature that way.<eos> And I'm not here to get in the way of you and your boyfriend.
Okay.<eos> Clara's gonna pick you up from soccer.<eos> Do you have your water bottle?<eos> - Water.<eos> - Great. Hey, kiddo, it's great seeing you.<eos> Maybe next time we can hang out a little longer.<eos> Maybe catch some Scooby and Shaggy.<eos> Who are Scooby and Shaggy?<eos> Who's Scooby and Shaggy?<eos> Oh, you're killing me, I got a lot to teach you.
Here.<eos> The Mayflower Chronicles.<eos> It's a private account of the journey undertaken by the Pilgrims to the New World.<eos> When the Pilgrims arrived on these shores, they faced a host of hardships.<eos> Starvation, disease.<eos> And something far deadlier.<eos> The settlers had unwittingly brought something with them from the Old World.<eos> A monster, stowed away in the bowels of the Mayflower and come to life upon their arrival in Plymouth.<eos> Young lady!<eos> There's something I wish to show you.
Then what was it?<eos> Was it a monster?<eos> Yes.<eos> It was a monster.<eos> I was responsible for bringing it here.<eos> By drawing those symbols.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> I should have just been honest with you.
Was it a monster?<eos> Yes.<eos> It was a monster.<eos> I was responsible for bringing it here.<eos> By drawing those symbols.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> I should have just been honest with you.<eos> I should have just given you answers, instead of making you go looking for them on your own.
I... I have missed you so much.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I might ask the same question of you.<eos> I've been on a journey, my friend.<eos> A long, long, long journey of the soul.<eos> The kind of journey that I intend to take the world on as well.<eos> - The world?<eos> - Yes. I've been changed, Jobe.<eos> This change has helped me see that I... I have a powerful need to make sure the entire world changes for the better, as well.<eos> I swear to you, I will not rest until this world is born again.
Ecstasy?<eos> That's a perfectly legal supplement.<eos> There's nothing illegal happening here.<eos> Can I get back to what I was doing?<eos> Do you know Adam Pressman? Yeah.<eos> This is his event.<eos> Why?<eos> Yeah, well, we need to shut it down.<eos> Hey. Not bad.<eos> Get your own music, your own drugs, nobody talks to you.
It's a treatable condition.<eos> Not interested.<eos> In medication or in feeling better?<eos> Oop! Got to boogie.<eos> And just when we were getting somewhere, Doc.<eos> Want the rest of your salad?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> All right.<eos> Scorsese gave you this address?
- That's not okay.<eos> - No. - This is a two-way street.<eos> - Two ways.<eos> A partnership is a...<eos> Wait, hold on.<eos> No, no.<eos> Put it behind you, put it behind you.<eos> Okay, so, Owlsly I.D.'d Kang as our guy, so we should be good to go.<eos> Would've been nice to read that in a text.<eos> You know, the same way that I text you that he was here.
So now we're gonna bring up my phone etiquette?<eos> - It's terrible.<eos> It's terrible?<eos> So what would you like me to do?<eos> Maybe send a little smiley face - and a bunch more emojis?<eos> - Guys, okay.<eos> Enough.<eos> Yeah, give me a little hello... Enough!<eos> Enough.<eos> I told you this wouldn't work.
Hey, Rog!<eos> Riggs!<eos> What the... what the hell are you doing, Riggs?<eos> - Get out the street, man.<eos> - Roger!<eos> Count it.<eos> Half a million... it's all there.<eos> Just count it and let me go.<eos> Is that what you think happens now?<eos> I'm gonna be squeezing a lot more than a half a million out of you.
I mean,<eos> Kang didn't kill Owlsly.<eos> I mean...<eos> Kang didn't kill Adam.<eos> Owlsly did.<eos> She killed him and took Kang's money.<eos> And then she drugged me.<eos> What?<eos> What, did you know this already?<eos> What, 'cause I told you?
And-and they felt sorry for him.<eos> That's good.<eos> - That's good strategy.<eos> - No, they were impressed.<eos> They said that they'd never...<eos> Never seen a guy ask a girl out in person.<eos> Yeah.<eos> 'Cause nobody does it.<eos> Didn't I say that?<eos> What did I tell you?
I did it for The Movement.<eos> All those people had done horrible things.<eos> I know I was wrong.<eos> What I did was awful, and I'm gonna have to live with it.<eos> That and for what happened to Richard.<eos> What happened to Richard is not your fault.<eos> What will happen to him?<eos> His soul?<eos> So let me get this straight.<eos> A friend of yours at the FBI told you That my blackmail victims had been deposed?
What kind of sundae do you want?<eos> I don't know. You don't know?<eos> Just any kind of sundae?<eos> I don't know. Yeah.<eos> I like that.<eos> Here, go back to the truck.<eos> Go home.<eos> What? My FBI friend is here.<eos> Look, I don't know what side he's on.<eos> Just go home, and I'll let you know if you have to move again.
Go home.<eos> What? My FBI friend is here.<eos> Look, I don't know what side he's on.<eos> Just go home, and I'll let you know if you have to move again.<eos> Go.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Now, see, that's funny.<eos> You tell me to do the right thing, and then you run off with my case.<eos> Sarah isn't here with me.<eos> Eddie, I tell you a judge approved a warrant for your exwife, then you two disappear, and your car crosses the border that night.

Well, she's not here.<eos> Just me.<eos> Now, you know I don't believe a word you're saying.<eos> Look, I don't know what to tell you,
I was told that I had to finish the climb before I...<eos> And now that seems impossible.<eos> You know, II've always been able to to see things.<eos> You know, visions.<eos> But I have no control over when or how I see them.<eos> Like, I don't know what happens next, Or how all of this is going to end.<eos> I guess why I'm telling you all this is because... like, I don't know if I'm "the one."<eos> I know Steve has asked me to lead, but I justyou know, I just I don't know.<eos> Eddie.<eos> Eddie, we're with you.
Sam.<eos> Sam Field?<eos> His house is full of Deniers.<eos> Meadow Stamberg.<eos> Phil Kenswick.<eos> Betsy Singer.<eos> You remember Betsy?<eos> Well, what are they doing there?<eos> They want to reform The Movement.<eos> Okay. Thank you.
What about Eddie Lane?<eos> He's here.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Hello, Hawk.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's just, business.<eos> Now, one of you tell me what's going on.<eos> It's complicated, kid.<eos> Bye, Eddie.<eos> Cal, please I think it's best if your dad explained this one to you.
So that you can embrace what's new.<eos> How do we show mercy?<eos> When the one we're dying for forgiveness from is ourself?<eos> Forest.<eos> Because, um, that's where he was born.<eos> And came out into the world.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Forest Roberts.<eos> Why?<eos> Why did you do it? Hawk told you.
Let's go.<eos> Be a family.<eos> It's what you wanted. I mean, Canada?<eos> Anywhere.<eos> We were happy. We were almost happy, Eddie.<eos> - We could be happy.<eos> - Sarah<eos> Please.<eos> Sarah. Please don't go back inside.<eos> You will lose everything beautiful about you.
My hands.<eos> My hands burned. For this moment. So that I would never waver from faith.<eos> Youyou made mistakes. But you put us above everything.<eos> And you'd do it again.<eos> There are children your childrenhere.<eos> Together, we can put the rightful one in place.<eos> And if there is no right one, you, Sarah, You must take the role yourself.<eos>  We have And on this Ascension Day, we embracewewe pardon those who have left.<eos> And our Deniers, we take them backwe take them back into our embrace.<eos>  I told you.
The man has a wife and son, and still he asked me to abandon mine.<eos> - He doesn't have a family.<eos> I mean, he did.<eos> It's just...<eos> They were killed.<eos> I-i didn't know.<eos> - You know, I often wonder what Hank would have been like, if you hadn't left.<eos> Yeah, I call my dad Hank.<eos> We don't have the best relationship.<eos> But I don't need to tell you all that.
And in case I haven't made it clear, I like who you are.<eos> - You and I don't have a future together.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - When you stowed aboard the waverider, we pulled you from the timeline.<eos> Back in 1942, you have a destiny waiting for you.<eos> - How do you know all this? - Ray told me.<eos> He knows your granddaughter.<eos> - I don't think i should be hearing this.<eos> - Ask ray what happens to your village.<eos> Ask him what happens to your daughter and your granddaughter, then tell me, tell me you'll choose history over your own family.
- It's sporadic.<eos> She's still got a couple pushes left in her.<eos> Just need to point her in the right direction.<eos> - There's been a rather interesting development down here on the ground.<eos> -Nate,areyou there?<eos> - Yeah, Mick, what's up?<eos> - There's some kid in mission control calling himself Hank Heywood.<eos> - That's your son.<eos> - I fixed an essay writing contest so Hank would win.<eos> I should've told you earlier.
Yeah, in the middle of being a good little doggie to those insufferable wannabes.<eos> Stay on mission, now.<eos> Gotta find this hobbit guy.<eos> J.R.R. Tolkien, why?<eos> Hoping for an autograph?<eos> I don't even know who that guy is.<eos> All I know is I gotta find this hobbit guy who knows the guy who's buried with Jesus' blood.<eos> Then we can destroy the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Mick, Mick, Mick, when have we ever destroyed anything we've ever stolen, let alone the most valuable score in the universe?<eos> What have they done to you?
Steal us an ambulance, will you?<eos> On it.<eos> What happened to the man who never took orders from anyone?<eos> I respected the hell out of that guy.<eos> Now you're just their trained pet.<eos> Sit, Mick. Fetch, Mick.<eos> Good boy, Mick.<eos> I'm no one's... pet.<eos> Sure you are.<eos> They may act all friendly to you, but they'll never trust you, never.
No, no, no, no.<eos> No need to defend yourself.<eos> Actually, there is.<eos> Get behind me!<eos> What is this madness?<eos> What are you?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We gotta go!<eos> Not without the engraving!<eos> You actually care about these losers.

although some would prefer to call it "common cowardice."<eos> Said the guy who dodged bullets to get a grave rubbing. Give me a break.<eos> Proof I belong in a library, and not on a... battlefield.<eos> I know where we have to go to destroy the spear.<eos> Where?<eos> The middle of hell on Earth.<eos> You hear them too, huh?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> The voices.<eos> What's the spear saying to you?
We're home free, buddy.<eos> It's good to be the king.<eos> No getaway, no chase?<eos> You want a chase, I can arrange a chase.<eos> Even get us tossed in Iron Heights, and we can plan an escape just like old times.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> - Boring! Well, we could hit up the Central City Bank.<eos> They've got a fancy new vault I've been dying to crack.<eos> What's the point?<eos> You own the bank and half the city.
I don't know where the Englishman is.<eos> Neither do it.<eos> I can only imagine how those psychopaths are torturing Rip.<eos> Gideon! I've discovered the missing ingredient for my recipe.<eos> Rum.<eos> And speaking of which, I'm gonna need you to fabricate me another bottle of it.<eos> Ooh, and some nachos.<eos> I will do nothing of the sort.<eos> What?<eos> You will do as I tell you, Gideon, I'm your captain!
Ooh, and some nachos.<eos> I will do nothing of the sort.<eos> What?<eos> You will do as I tell you, Gideon, I'm your captain!<eos> Then it's time for you to start acting like one.<eos> Now, sit up straight and show your backbone, Captain Hunter.<eos> Gideon, for the thousandth time,<eos> I've got no way of getting the reserve power back online, and I've got no way of...<eos> Of sending out any signal of any sort, which means...<eos> Which means that I am destined to live out the rest of my days right... here... with you.
Don't worry.<eos> I know that place like the back of my hand.<eos> What about Mick?<eos> Mick's staying here.<eos> We can't trust him.<eos> Not after what you've done.<eos> After what I've done?<eos> If it wasn't for me, you'd all be walking around like sheep.<eos> If it wasn't for you, we never would have been turned into sheep in the first place.<eos> We trusted you, Mick.
It will once I get better at drawing ears!<eos> Look, I signed up yesterday, and I've been raking in cash.<eos> And leaves!<eos> It's all going in my college fund.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Moving things?<eos> Standing in line?<eos> Delivering food without eating it?<eos> Are these people Crank Yankers?<eos> Ooh, here's one you'll like.
Yes! I am.<eos> It's just that I've only been called "the talent" once before.<eos> It was in a dream, and that sexy mouse was being very sarcastic.<eos> Well, I'm Gordy. Really excited you could come in.<eos> Just need to lay down some backup vocals on a few tracks.<eos> Can I get you anything, a tea or a water?<eos> I'll have a water, two sugars.<eos> [Titus] I feel like a real professional here-- not like those freeloading Olympic athletes.<eos> So, um, these are all original songs. They're my babies.<eos> You mean they stole your youth and made you boring?
♪ Israel! ♪<eos> ♪ Israel is behind it all ♪<eos> ♪ Every Jew got an e-mail that mornin' ♪<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Moving on.<eos> Gordy's got some opinions.<eos> ♪ Milk has an expiration date ♪<eos> ♪ We should do that with the elderly ♪<eos> What, Xan, are you afraid I'm gonna embarrass you in front of your cool new friends?<eos> Well, I think you've forgotten I can... [robotically] break it down.
Everything I believe in is right here in magenta and white.<eos> The black cartridge ran out, and I'm no longer welcome at Office Max.<eos> [ominous music] [softly] He's a monster!<eos> Oh, my God, you bought it! You actually did a non-lame thing.<eos> Hold your horses, Xan.<eos> Hold them tight.<eos> -Cherish them.<eos> -What?<eos> I don't know. I haven't eaten today.<eos> Look, I get that you want to look cool in front of your roommates, so you asked your fleeky older friend to buy you beer.

"Kimmy looks like a traffic cone on a snowman, but there's less of a reason for her to exist.<eos> She was hired to put together a rowing machine. Instead she took apart my will to live."<eos> Then a soft-serve chocolate ice cream emoji, so thank you for that.<eos> No, that's not--<eos> Forget it.<eos> I know it's hard, but you're so lucky, Xan.<eos> I would die to come here!<eos> Stop trying to cheer me up by saying you'll die.<eos> Right now, it probably feels like the world is ending, but I know if you don't give up and you think positive, things will work out.<eos> -I want to fight you. -No, you don't.
Please, I don't want it.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Spencer, please go to the other room. Mom:<eos> Don't treat him like a child. Dad:<eos> I'm not gonna have this conversation in front of him. Mom:<eos> I'm not crazy.<eos> If you refuse to take care of yourself, I can't help you.
Rosa.<eos> Rosa Medina.<eos> I think she's a doctor.<eos> All right.<eos> Where did you meet her?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> If you saw her, would you remember her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think so.<eos> You're missing time, aren't you?
There's cocaine and heroin in your system.<eos> What else?<eos> He was in possession of cocaine and heroin when he was arrested.<eos> I found what I need.<eos> No, I need a full tox screen panel.<eos> We're looking for scopolamine.<eos> That'll take longer.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I need it.<eos> You were given a speedball.
Stop!<eos> Give it back to me!<eos> Oh! Stay away from me!<eos> For God's sake, leave me alone! Mom!<eos> Stop!<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> I hate that stuff and I hate you!<eos> Do you have any idea what I went through to get that medicine?<eos> It can't be replaced.<eos> To you realize that?
I remember what happened to the vials at home.<eos> My mom threw most of them out.<eos> So that's why you were here, to get more.<eos> It must be.<eos> Well, you're off the hook for that.<eos> There was no contraband involved.<eos> Yeah, but we were still looking at the planted drug and murder charges, which could keep you here for a long time.<eos> So what can we do to delay the transfer?<eos> You said that you met Nadie, who calls herself Rosa, in Houston.<eos> Why didn't she just give you the vials in the U.S.? I don't know.
I promise.<eos> Thanks for the ride home.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> Commercial airlines kick my ass nowadays. You?<eos> Once you've had the best, it's hard to go back.<eos> I was just thanking Clara for helping us.<eos> Yeah, and I told her, when one of us is in trouble, we all are.<eos> You guys have any other problems with this, we happen to know some people.<eos> Love that.<eos> I can't thank you enough.
I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.<eos> Lady Aethelflaed has followed her father's wishes and married Aethelred, the Lord of Mercia.<eos> Bringing King Alfred's dream of an England ever closer.<eos> Lord, love should be gentle and kind.<eos> In a happier union, Father Beocca has married my sister, Thyra.<eos> Excuse me, Lord Uhtred. I am Osferth.<eos> You are Alfred's bastard son.<eos> After failing to convince me to join them, the Northmen brothers, Erik and Sigefrid, have taken the city of Lunden.<eos> You say you are sworn, yet you float into Daneland and back again.<eos> How am I to trust you?
What is on your mind?<eos> I am thinking of Aethelflaed.<eos> If she lives, you will be her hope.<eos> Alfred is her father.<eos> YOU will be her hope, Uhtred of Bebbenberg.<eos> It should not be for you to resolve, but you will do it.<eos> By sending Sihtric, you have already begun.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> No, I am hungry!<eos> I will help you.
You saw nothing.<eos> What do you want?<eos> What do I want?<eos> I'm here to remind you that you're a woman and a hostage.<eos> I like the paleness of your skin.<eos> Show me.<eos> Take off your clothes.<eos> Does the Lord Erik know that you're here?<eos> It was the Lord Erik that sent me.<eos> Now, remove your clothes or I will rip them from you!
You.<eos> You!<eos> Aethelwold.<eos> Odda, you are drunk.<eos> I sincerely hope so, I can barely see.<eos> At your age, it is not good for you.<eos> What is your opinion on paying a ransom for Aethelflaed?<eos> Do you have an opinion?<eos> Not one I am prepared to say aloud.<eos> Is there much, or any, of your father in you? The king past?
I have both my father's blood and spirit, the Danes know it.<eos> Even the dead know it.<eos> I am becoming more like him by the day-observe the clean tunic.<eos> He was a great man.<eos> He was my great friend.<eos> If you are indeed his son, I may need you.<eos> You may need me for what?<eos> I believe you need your bed, Lord.<eos> And a pillow.<eos> You should employ a craftsman to fit a spoon in place of the blade.
You may need me for what?<eos> I believe you need your bed, Lord.<eos> And a pillow.<eos> You should employ a craftsman to fit a spoon in place of the blade.<eos> The leaves are falling.<eos> I want the ransom paid in full by winter, an army by spring.<eos> A king's crown by summer.<eos> They will want the same, answers by winter.<eos> How does she ride?<eos> Oh, you wouldn't like her-she's bony and she squeals.
As you can see, she is well.<eos> I would like to speak with her.<eos> Then, do it.<eos> They are treating you well?<eos> They are.<eos> You have not been... touched?<eos> I have not.<eos> What I must now do is secure an acceptable price for your release.<eos> There will be word games played, do not be alarmed by what I may say.<eos> I assure you, once this is over, they shall pay for what they have done to us all.
He will.<eos> Even for an unloved daughter?<eos> Alfred is suffering.<eos> He loves her dearly.<eos> Her husband does not.<eos> I was surprised at your anger towards Aethelred.<eos> What purpose did it serve?<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> It was.<eos> You made it clear that you care for her.
Lord?<eos> Dagfinn, you can go.<eos> All of you.<eos> Yes, Lord.<eos> Is that enough?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uhtred can read?<eos> All of my father's ealdormen can read and write.<eos> Although the letters Uhtred has written, you could count with one finger.<eos> I will teach you.
So you will take him this letter.<eos> This is a great responsibility.<eos> They will have no peace.<eos> None.<eos> I have told them the same.<eos> But you will still help them?<eos> I must, I have no choice.<eos> If they escape then there will be no ransom paid.<eos> No great army.<eos> The men of Wessex are saved, yes, but what becomes of you?
Then in six months' time we shall ask for his life!<eos> What I want, Lord, is for good sense to prevail.<eos> By good sense, I presume you mean the death or humiliation of my daughter and of the reputation of Wessex?<eos> Or we march, Lord, and we fight.<eos> If we march they will kill her.<eos> And she will be considered a martyr, for Wessex, Lord, her dignity preserved!<eos> Odda, what has saved you from outright banishment is that you chose your King over your own son.<eos> Lord, I chose Wessex over my son.<eos> A traitor! You should at least consider doing the same!<eos> What am I to do with you?
Climb onto the cart. You can help guard Mercia's ransom.<eos> God bless you, Lord, saviour of my blistered feet.<eos> Lord?<eos> Osferth?<eos> Can I say to you that I'm afraid?<eos> I wear a sword but barely know how to use it.<eos> I pray that when battle comes, I will not fail you.<eos> Osferth, at times we're all afraid.<eos> Courage is finding the will to overcome your fear, nothing more.<eos> Perhaps we'll find you an axe. It requires less skill than a sword.
Erik is still with me.<eos> And perhaps within me.<eos> And if over the coming months, my husband should think what you are thinking, it would be a great comfort, Uhtred, to know that I could call upon you again, should I ever need to.<eos> Of course.<eos> Do you swear?<eos> You are the man I trust most, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.<eos> I swear.<eos> I swear, Lady.<eos> Then I shall dare to kiss you.<eos> It seems you have made a habit of rescuing Wessex.
Judy!<eos> Judy what are you doing?<eos> Come on!<eos> I want to hear the music!<eos> You're going to get me in trouble.
Can you see 5,000 Roman soldiers marching south?<eos> Down there, by the river.<eos> They'd have followed the river, that's what they did.<eos> There is so much that you don't understand about Roman Britain.<eos> - I got an A star.<eos> - "Got an A star."<eos> I've lived in Roman Britain.<eos> Governed. Farmed. Juggled.<eos> And speaking as a former vestal virgin, second class,<eos> I can assure you...
I'll have to find my way home somehow.<eos> This is the safest place to be.<eos> The beast is still out there.<eos> You came back.<eos> Did you know what was in there?<eos> The gate.<eos> A portal between dimensions, do you know what's on the other side?<eos> You don't know anything, do you?<eos> You just stand around making speeches and waving a TV aerial about.<eos> Shall I tell you what's in there? No.
Shift your arse, Roman!<eos> Close the trap door.<eos> Block it off! We have to block it off!<eos> Centurions, defence formation.<eos> It's falling back.<eos> It's waiting.<eos> It's waiting to feed off the sunlight, to grow to its full strength.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> I brought you the Ninth Legion. Whoa, there they are.
It's falling back.<eos> It's waiting.<eos> It's waiting to feed off the sunlight, to grow to its full strength.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> I brought you the Ninth Legion. Whoa, there they are.<eos> The lost Legion of the Ninth.<eos> Totally found them.<eos> Yeah, you totally did.<eos> Nardole, what happened to you?
All you understand is war. No.<eos> He understands.<eos> Don't you?<eos> And now he's wondering why.<eos> You speak Latin?<eos> I don't!<eos> Neither do I. Not a word.<eos> And I don't speak whatever they speak either.<eos> It's him.<eos> It's you, isn't it?
Then someone else better stop them.<eos> Nobody else can!<eos> I can.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Time to grow up, Doctor.<eos> Time to fight my fight.<eos> I'm sorry, no.<eos> No-one else can do this, not like I can.<eos> We can.<eos> I'm ready. I'll guard the gate with you.
Oh. Jacqueline! Did you know feminism is sexy now?<eos> [Jacqueline] It is? I'm a feminist.<eos> I think we should get to vote.<eos> Why is your voice so echoey?<eos> Oh, did you get a parrot?<eos> I'm hiding in the bathroom because my brother-in-law is here, and I know he's trying to get me into bed.<eos> [Kimmy] What?<eos> Jacqueline, you need to tell him Homey don't play that.<eos> But first, establish "Homey" as one of your many nicknames.<eos> You know, something like, "Can Homey offer you a glass of water?"
That's why I need someone here to run interference.<eos> Oh, well, I've got plans tonight.<eos> [laughing] You?<eos> Goodness.<eos> No. First of all, you cannot keep a secret.<eos> I ate a hamburger out of the trash.<eos> And I need someone with experience in psychosexual drama, like that flamboyant boyfriend of yours.<eos> -Titus?<eos> He's gay.<eos> -Well, it's not the last time -that's gonna happen to you.
[Titus] I'm in such pain!<eos> And then 30 minutes later, apologize again.<eos> Of all the days for Flouncy to break up with his underage lover.<eos> [mouthing] Really?<eos> But I'm glad we're friends again.<eos> Next time you're in town, just whistle.<eos> You do know how to whistle, don't you, Duke?<eos> You just tell the doorman you need a taxi.<eos> Flouncy Magoo?<eos> Titus, I owe you one.
No, I got it.<eos> So did she say that I was ghosting you?<eos> Like-- like, I died but still had unfinished business here on Earth?<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Then I thought maybe they were saying "goatsing," like, [tune of "The Star-Spangled Banner"] ♪ Baa-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba-baa ♪<eos> No, that doesn't feel right. Well, either way, I'm glad we didn't ghost or goatsing each other.<eos> Me too.<eos> Uh, can I drop you off someplace?<eos> I'm not really tired.<eos> Maybe I could keep you company while you drive.

- I thought you were my boyfriend.<eos> - I am.<eos> It's, like, all I talk about.<eos> "My boyfriend's on a cruise." "My boyfriend's a great singer."<eos> "Hey, that pug dog looks just like my boyfriend."<eos> I came by your house last night after I turned down a three-way with a puppet...<eos> you're welcome... only to find you laughing with some boy like two white ladies looking at a salad!<eos> You were spying on me?<eos> I was surprising you!<eos> You made it spying by being shady. You know what?
So stupid.<eos> It's this.<eos> I make that sound a lot 'cause no one will high-five me.<eos> Sure, but philosophy's so much more than that.<eos> It teaches you how to really think.<eos> Right. Right.<eos> Penguin with teeth.<eos> Like, okay, so... how do you know you're even here right now?<eos> See?<eos> Okay, but what if you're really just a brain in a vat somewhere in a lab and that was just a bunch of electrical signals to make you think you pinched yourself?
Setting pitching style for "Basic Dudebro."<eos> Yeah, you know it!<eos> - Told you he was in love with you. - What?<eos> What movie were you watching?<eos> Glitter, on my phone.<eos> But I saw the way that boy was looking at you.<eos> That's crazy. This is just friend stuff.<eos> Are you serious right now?<eos> My Lord.<eos> Mikey, I have always loved your naïveté, but don't make me spell it out for you, because my French teacher was named Madame Scruggs.
And, Kimmy, you are not gonna regret this.<eos> I'm gonna show those fat-cat politicians who's boss!<eos> Attica! Attica! - Gattaca!<eos> Gattaca! Gattaca! - Attica!<eos> That was fun.<eos> Titus, you were right.<eos> And also?<eos> Your skin actually does look amazing today, so I don't mind saying it.<eos> How did he do it?<eos> Did he give you a single rose with a teddy bear clipped to it?
- Classic!<eos> - It doesn't matter, though. I realized this is all my fault.<eos> Titus, I never told him we were together. Why didn't I do that?<eos> I tell everybody.<eos> And why did I wear my date-night outfit? What's wrong with me?<eos> I mean, it never even occurred to me that you could play video games with a guy and watch sports with him and, like, touch butts and stuff, all in one guy, like some kind of sexy Swiss Army knife.<eos> That's crazy, right?<eos> I mean, that could be too much of a good thing.<eos> You must be confusing me with one of those Sex and the City creatures. This is not brunch.<eos> I am not the one to help you decide between Mr. Big and Hormf.

Hello, Regina.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Shouldn't you be living in a tulip somewhere?<eos> What happened to me doesn't matter.<eos> Just look at you.<eos> You've done nothing but fill your heart with hate since we saw each other.<eos> But it doesn't have to be that way.<eos> What do you care about any of this?<eos> I care because this started with me.<eos> I showed you your future with the pixie dust.

That means a lot.<eos> That just leaves the question...<eos> What happened to the Evil Queen?<eos> She's still a snake right?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> She got loose.<eos> And if she has figured out a way to escape her mortal coil, well, there's no telling what evil she could be up to.<eos> Couldn't you use magic to dig this hole?<eos> You're right, but what would be the fun in that?<eos> You don't mind a little dirty work, do you?
A pair of scissors?<eos> Don't underestimate them.<eos> These blades are enchanted.<eos> Capable of cutting a person from their fate.<eos> You want to use them on Regina... to break her from her destiny.<eos> No.<eos> My plan for her involves something much more permanent.<eos> I'm going to use these blades to finally separate us, so once and for all...<eos> I can destroy her.<eos> You can tell the ocean your secrets, but the question is whether the ocean will tell you hers.
You're the only other person who knows.<eos> Once they find out... there may be no coming back.<eos> Be careful, my boy.<eos> Guilt can be as corrosive to the soul as revenge.<eos> Which means... that you must tell this woman and her family the truth or keep it a secret and learn to forgive yourself.<eos> What if I can't?<eos> Either way, you must.<eos> Heed my advice, Killian... please.<eos> Seek forgiveness.<eos> Because whatever happened, it will always stay with you.
Give it back.<eos> Unh-unh-unh!<eos> I'll be holding on to this.<eos> I wouldn't want you ruining my plans by writing me out of existence with a swoop of your authorial pen.<eos> That's what you think I want... to make you disappear?<eos> Well, isn't it?<eos> After all, that's what Regina wants.<eos> That's because she thinks you're the worst parts of her.<eos> But you don't?<eos> I know there's good in you, just like there's bad in her.
That means you can change.<eos> And you thought you can break the rules by using your author powers to give me a little push?<eos> I don't know what I was going to do.<eos> Well, I suppose I should be flattered.<eos> Look at yourself.<eos> You finally got the revenge you wanted on Snow White, and are you happy?<eos> Perhaps not.<eos> But I will be.<eos> What are you planning?<eos> Something you won't like.
But I will be.<eos> What are you planning?<eos> Something you won't like.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> Eventually, you'll realize it's for the best.<eos> Because you were right, Henry.<eos> You're still my son.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Give this to Regina.<eos> And, remember, no matter what anyone tries to tell you... I love you.
Give this to Regina.<eos> And, remember, no matter what anyone tries to tell you... I love you.<eos> Regina, we need to talk.<eos> Daddy, please.<eos> I've heard it all before.<eos> I know... you don't think revenge will make me happy.<eos> But I'm going to find out.<eos> Don't try to stop me.<eos> I'm not here to try to stop you.<eos> Actually, I'm here to help you get it.
Well, of course I do.<eos> I watched you ride him across the field outside our manor.<eos> No matter how far you went, I could still see that smile on your face.<eos> It wasn't a horse that put a smile on my face, Daddy.<eos> That was the day I met Daniel.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I want you to be happy again.<eos> But I don't believe killing Snow White will do that.<eos> Maybe by my helping you, you'll be able to move on so you can.

Enough!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Getting what I came for.<eos> My revenge.<eos> Dead men tell no tales.<eos> That's David's father.<eos> It was you.<eos> Emma, let me explain.<eos> No, it seems very clear to me.<eos> I swear to you... I wanted to tell you.
I'm not talking about that.<eos> I'm talking about this.<eos> You were about to burn your own memories.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Because I was ashamed, Emma, and scared of losing you and everything that matters to me.<eos> And you really think that would happen after everything we've been through?<eos> You tell me... how am I supposed to sit across from your mother and father at the table and look them in the eye after what I've done?<eos> I'm not saying it would be easy.<eos> You know them.<eos> You know they would forgive you.
And how are you gonna do that?<eos> Do you remember what you told me the first time I was on this vessel?<eos> You said the Nautilus could help a man discover who he could be.<eos> And I was hoping...<eos> I was hoping you might have room for one more.<eos> Well, then.<eos> Captain Hook is always welcome on the Nautilus.<eos> We push off at nightfall.<eos> You shouldn't have come here.<eos> I couldn't let anything happen to you.
No.<eos> Aaaaah!<eos> You tried to destroy me because you couldn't stand looking at the darkness?<eos> Well, I can't stand looking at the light.<eos> Well, you don't have to worry about that.<eos> You really believe you're better than me.<eos> Huh?<eos> Stronger than me?<eos> !<eos> Because you think you filled that nasty little hole inside you with love and friendship and hope?

And now that I have them, you will never take them away from me.<eos> I hate you.<eos> But I don't.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm going to do what we never could.<eos> I'm going to be brave for both of us and choose love over hate.<eos> No.<eos> What's happening to me?<eos> I gave you some of my love... love from Henry and Robin and the people I care most about.

You are?<eos> And why is that?<eos> Let's just say... I've had a change of heart.<eos> - Have you, now?<eos> - I have.<eos> And I was wondering if... maybe... I might buy you a drink?<eos> Well, seeing as this is my realm, how 'bout I buy you one?<eos> Hook!<eos> Are you going somewhere?<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you and Emma.
Um...<eos> It's so cold out here.<eos> Go home.<eos> Are you ready for adventure, Captain?<eos> No.<eos> I'm done running.<eos> I'm going back to Emma.<eos> Even villains get second chances... and, hopefully, even third ones.<eos> I couldn't be happier to hear that.<eos> I wish you all the happiness.

In theory, a small matter of financial housekeeping.<eos> In reality, a dickswinging contest extraordinaire.<eos> Right, Fitzpatrick, what you got for me?<eos> Fuck off, I went first last week.<eos> Come on, it's Lavatory's turn.<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> All right, calm down, Lavatory, it's only a nickname.<eos> No, a nickname is an affectionate term between mates.<eos> I think you're a massive prick, ergo not a nickname.<eos> Yeah, well, I'll show you a massive prick.
Fuck me.<eos> Vincent Swan.<eos> Dicky Cox?<eos> Dicky Dipshit, I think you used to call me at school.<eos> Cox by name, cock by nature.<eos> Yeah, that was another one.<eos> You all right, Vince?<eos> You look like shit. No.<eos> No, I'm not all right, Dicky.<eos> I got sacked this morning, and now I'm crying next to a urinal full of my own puke, talking to you.
Does he know you call him that?<eos> 'Ere, Brendan, have you...<eos> Yeah, all right, all right. Here you go.<eos> Dickhead.<eos> Daddy!<eos> I come in peace.<eos> Someone's seen fit to grace us with their presence.<eos> Someone also wants to say sorry for not being around lately.<eos> How are my cheeky little monkeys?<eos> Vincent, you do know I'm 14 years old.
It's only temporary. But why him?<eos> Because he actually sells my bloody windows!<eos> If you want to be considered for the role then get out there and sign me some fucking orders!<eos> Ouch.<eos> Can I just say that firing Vincent was a smart move.<eos> I don't want to speak ill of the recently departed but that man was a liability.<eos> I'm going to have to ring some serious changes round here if we're going to be competitive again.<eos> Look, until I get the chance to meet some potential new recruits, I just need you to steady the ship and not fuck anything up, Brian.<eos> Understood, boss.<eos> Still, in the meantime, there's no harm me showing you how we get things done the Fitzpatrick way.
Will you just calm down? This isn't like when I resigned from the refinery.<eos> You were sacked from the bloody refinery! You didn't resign!<eos> Potato, pot-ato.<eos> Walked, sacked, it's all the same.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> The important thing is here I've been offered a better job.<eos> One with a company car.<eos> If you say company car one more time I'm divorcing you.<eos> What's the better job? Ah.<eos> See, this is what I've been trying to tell you.
I don't give a shit, mate, I've moved on.<eos> Got myself a job with those publishing boyses.<eos> You know what, if you're lucky, I might just let you have a spin in my mega company car when it arrives.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Congratulations, mate.<eos> Are they still looking for reps?<eos> You disloyal little shit.<eos> Do I sense some disharmony in the ranks?<eos> Do let me know if you need a few pointers on how to motivate a sales team, Sheriff.<eos> From you?
I've yet to meet a good salesman who isn't a terrible loser.<eos> Absolutely, boss.<eos> I'm sure I'll turn into a total cunt out there as well. I'll see you Saturday.<eos> All right, boyses.<eos> Meanwhile, Fitzpatrick's attempt at modernising Cachet had hit a Brummie brick wall.<eos> If it's so bloody clever, why can't I just say, "Computer,<eos> "store these addresses," rather than all this mumbo jumbo from the future language.<eos> Because it's the cutting edge of technology, Carol, not a genie from a fucking lamp.<eos> A lamp in here would be more useful. It gets very gloomy.<eos> Whether you like it or not, I'm trying to drag this operation into the 1980s.
Right, here's what you're going to do.<eos> You're going to go back to Walshy, and ask him for your job back.<eos> You might have to start I can't, Sam.<eos> It won't be for long, will it?<eos> Fitzpatrick will be lucky if he gets another week as showroom manager.<eos> I don't think I can do it.<eos> Vincent, look at me.<eos> No-one believes in you more than you do, baby.<eos> Right?<eos> There's always going to be a Walshy or a little prick trying to fuck you over, but you're better than them.
No-one believes in you more than you do, baby.<eos> Right?<eos> There's always going to be a Walshy or a little prick trying to fuck you over, but you're better than them.<eos> That's why I married you.<eos> You old romantic.<eos> I thought it was cos I got you pregnant.<eos> Yeah, there was that.<eos> You are incredible.<eos> I thought you were going to leave me.<eos> Well, it's hard to be mad at you when you're wearing those tight white trousers.
This is me saying sorry.<eos> I need you back, Vincent.<eos> Fitzpatrick's taken us from selling 50 grand a week to zero.<eos> Minus four grand if you include Carol's fucking unusable computer.<eos> Well, you're on the right lines, Walshy.<eos> But you better make it a BMW or I'll never set foot in your poxy showroom again.<eos> Oh, fucking hell, Vincent!<eos> Call it danger money.<eos> Carol told me you've got that psycho Ronnie Farrell on your case. OK.<eos> I'll call the leasing company and get you a BMW, but you better get us out of this hole with Ronnie.

OK.<eos> I'll call the leasing company and get you a BMW, but you better get us out of this hole with Ronnie.<eos> I can't afford to be giving away five grand's worth of windows.<eos> Leave Ronnie to me.<eos> 'I quickly managed to get Ronnie Farrell onside by making him 'an offer he couldn't refuse.'<eos> So you've sorted it with Farrell?<eos> Yeah, you can stop shitting your pants now.
He's not going to hurt anyone.<eos> How did you do that? Let's just say we came to a compromise.<eos> Great.<eos> What's the compromise?<eos> I told him he can have the windows for free.<eos> What? ! Why have you done that?<eos> Because he's an incredibly violent, dangerous man.<eos> But that's going to cost me five fucking grand!<eos> You should have thought about that before you put Fitzpatrick in charge, you stupid prick.<eos> Let that be a valuable lesson to you.
It's business time...<eos> I'm on my knees, begging for all of your product...<eos> That's it.<eos> Mm, close the deal.<eos> All over my fingers.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - There we go.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm going to have to change now.<eos> Well, let that be a lesson to you.

- It's not political.<eos> I just don't particularly want to see Donna's or anyone's tits splashed across my newspaper.<eos> Careful with that smart mouth of yours, boy.<eos> - I'll take the pictures, Brendan.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Here's the camera.<eos> If you'd like to just follow me upstairs, Donna.<eos> I'll be back in an hour, love.<eos> Don't be late cos I've got majorettes at six.<eos> There's something wrong with you.
- Vincent Swan, Robbie's dad. - Oh, hi.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Your wife wasn't sure if you could make it.<eos> Wouldn't miss it for the world.<eos> In my day, it was always the naughty boys that sat at the back of the bus.<eos> Well, it still is, although it's not only the boys<eos> - that get up to no good. - Certainly not in my experience.<eos> Now, where would you like me, Miss Lyndsey?<eos> I think up front where I can keep my eye on you.<eos> Dad, saved you a seat.
Holy Mother of God!<eos> Hello? Stanford 4163.<eos> Sorry, he's out, Walshy.<eos> You'll have to calm down, I can't understand a word you're saying.<eos> Walshy was on the warpath.<eos> He'd seen Police Five and was threatening to sack us all first thing Monday.<eos> So, not only did I have to torch the entire fucking pirate ET stock,<eos> I had to call Ronnie Farrell and explain why he had to collect his equipment immediately.<eos> He took it reasonably well, for a dangerous sociopath.<eos> 200 I've already paid you, plus 100 for the inconvenience.
You sound like my kind of sexy elf.<eos> And you sound dangerous, Widow Maker.<eos> Really?<eos> As in mysterious.<eos> Not like a rapist.<eos> After an hour of some fairly horrific flirting, the Widow Maker finally worked up the bottle to ask the Elf on a date.<eos> Tri-Star, 48 channels. Dual bandwidth.<eos> Ooh! Impressive kit.<eos> I'd love to see it.<eos> 'And after that maybe I'll show you my CB radio too.'

Go on, fuck off down to the shed, you little sad bastard. Maureen!<eos> - The neighbours!<eos> - Your jumper's shit!<eos> The closest thing he had to a social life was us and the complete tools he befriended on CB radio.<eos> Breaker breaker, this is the Widow Maker.<eos> I can't leave her.<eos> I'm all she's got.<eos> Man, that's rough.<eos> I feel terrible now, Brian.<eos> Can I give you a hand job at least, to say sorry?
Much like the derriere that left its mark on Walshy's desk, I didn't mind taking a pounding for the sake of Fitzpatrick's morale.<eos> Whose bum is this, for Christ's sake?<eos> Morning, homo sapiens.<eos> Emphasis on the homo.<eos> So unnecessary.<eos> Pretty soon Fitzpatrick was back to his cocky, old unpleasant self.<eos> Now that's what you call man management.<eos> And seeing as I'd already taken a bollocking for the misuse of Walshy's office, I figured I might as well commit the crime.<eos> Come here, you.<eos> I do hope you're going to brush your teeth before you teach my second born.

You don't mention her name.<eos> What, so you can make jokes about me teaching Robbie, but she's off limits?<eos> It's only been 20 seconds since my dick was inside you.
I've still got to prepare the classroom, and floss my teeth.<eos> Hello, Miss Lyndsey.<eos> Oh, hi, Mrs Swan.<eos> Shouldn't you be somewhere else?<eos> Sports day training this afternoon, so I get a long lunch.<eos> Having said that, I'd better dash.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hello, gorgeous.<eos> What a lovely surprise.<eos> I want a word with you. Upstairs. Now.
I said pop in. That was it. I was chasing a lead.<eos> Well, just fucking think about how it looks before you start gallivanting around town with our son's pretty, young teacher.<eos> Miss Lyndsey, pretty?<eos> I hadn't noticed.<eos> You're such an arsehole.<eos> Come here.<eos> One sec.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Vince, some bird's on the line. Says she's the editor of the local paper.<eos> She wants to talk to you.
I even laid out another 500 quid on this understated advertorial.<eos> You have a lovely day.<eos> No, no, the pleasure's all mine.<eos> All right, ta.<eos> You look like the cat that got the cream sucked out of his balls.<eos> That was the editor of The Chronicle.<eos> She said it wouldn't be a terrible idea if I started preparing a speech.<eos> How about, "Dear mentals in charge of voting,<eos> "thank you for collectively losing your minds."<eos> It sounds like you're a shoe-in, boss.
A double.<eos> A double of...<eos> Of... anything that will take the edge off.<eos> Righty-ho.<eos> Sam?<eos> No, I'm good, thanks.<eos> I'll have a pint, please, Lavatory.<eos> Good to know. You can get it yourself.<eos> Come on, if you're going.<eos> I'm going, but just so that you're clear, I'm definitely not bringing you back a pint.
Cheers.<eos> Oh, hi, Sam.<eos> Yeah, sorry, I'll get these.<eos> Yeah, I know you will.<eos> I'm just making sure we get served before last orders.<eos> Yeah, good call. Turns out I've got the bar presence of the invisible man.<eos> So this must seem a far cry from hanging out with pop stars.<eos> I was in the band of an "about to pop" star.<eos> It wasn't really that glamourous.<eos> You must miss it, though?
Yeah, a bit, especially on nights like this.<eos> There was a stage I was playing to a room this size, now I'm making small talk with Fitzpatrick and Thyroid...<eos> Sorry, Maureen.<eos> Thyroid?<eos> She had a thyroid problem, it affected her weight. Sorry, that sounded mean.<eos> Yeah, that's quite mean.<eos> But no need to apologise.<eos> I can't stand the rude, fat bitch.<eos> She is a charmer, isn't she?<eos> Why, what's she said to upset you?
Never mind, Vincent, at least we had a nice steak out of it.<eos> Cor blimey!<eos> If I'd known it was going to be this entertaining I'd have paid for dinner myself.<eos> Shut up, you wally!<eos> You're fired.<eos> All right, let's call a truce on the pranks now, shall we?<eos> No, read my lips.<eos> You're fucking sacked.<eos> Whatever you say, boss<eos> Walshy will finish up with you next week. It'll be minus whatever the fuck I've laid out feeding you and Little Miss Sunshine over there.
How?<eos> How does it get sorted, Vincent?<eos> Eh? Are you going to find 50 grand down the back of the sofa?<eos> Like I always do, on my own.<eos> This isn't a game, Vincent.<eos> It's not another one of your showroom pranks.<eos> It's £50,000.<eos> We could lose our house, everything.<eos> Will you slow down?<eos> I don't remember you being so concerned about my tax affairs while you were out fucking spending all over the place.
Mistress Trixie doesn't live here any more, all right.<eos> Oh, Okay.<eos> Who does then?<eos> Look, mate, I'm really not in the mood for this.<eos> - Why not? - Why not?<eos> !<eos> Because I'm getting divorced.<eos> Because I owe the taxman 50 fucking grand.<eos> Because I've gone from being salesman of the century to a schlub who can't sell shit.<eos> But mainly because I spend my entire fucking life on this phone talking to perverts like you.
I've had enough of this place.<eos> Hang on, I was just about tell you Nature-Burn's...<eos> Shove your diet pills up your arse.<eos> Well, unfortunately Nature-Burn don't do suppositories, but soon as they do, I'll happily shove them up my arse.<eos> Martin, mate, hold up, let me buy you a pint.<eos> So, these diet pills work then?<eos> How much you charging?<eos> £30 for a month's supply.<eos> But I am running a one week's free trial to get people hooked... I mean, to get them on the road to a healthier lifestyle.<eos> I'm prepared to make that exclusive one-time offer exclusively to you, Tony.

- I'm sorting it.<eos> Save me the bullshit, Vincent.<eos> You're not capable of sorting anything right now.<eos> So please fuck off before I lose the only source of income for my family.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> We are not skint.<eos> Give that to the fucking building society!<eos> I think they might prefer a cheque or a standing order, old chap.<eos> Try and save some of that money, yeah?<eos> You've got Robbie for the day tomorrow and you'll need to buy him something for his tea.
Yeah.<eos> No, commercial success didn't really appeal to me.<eos> Well, here in Ben Billing's band we're all about the music.<eos> Now our bassist has broken his arm, and we need a replacement for tonight's warm-up gig.<eos> Then, and I don't know if you're up for this, we're going to be heading up north to tour to support the miners.<eos> Love supporting the miners.<eos> "Support The Miners!"<eos> I could well be interested in coming on the tour, thank you.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Because it's a very long commitment, and I'll be straight with you, last couple of gigs we've had some unwelcome attention from National Front thugs.
Oh, no.<eos> I think the suicide clutch has mangled my scrotum.<eos> Oh, God, I'm sorry!<eos> Why is the house for sale?<eos> Just come inside.<eos> I just wish that ball-bag Vincent could have told me about this first.<eos> Could we leave ball-bags out the conversation for now, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I've not had much to laugh about lately.<eos> I'm glad my testicles could bring you some pleasure.
Now it's all Thatcher's fucking children, buying their own council houses, bankrupting themselves with flash cars and shitty double-glazing.<eos> So I hope tonight wasn't so much fun as it was a much-needed lesson in social responsibility.<eos> And is it socially responsible to define people politically by what they buy?<eos> Because I think it's socially irresponsible. And fucking patronising.<eos> If you played a gig for striking double-glazing salesmen, I wonder how many miners would be in the audience to support them? Well, well, well.<eos> I see this lady is not for turning.<eos> Lavender, you going to be on the tour bus tomorrow night?<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> Sam, pleasure sparring with you, but got some TUC Execs in so I'd better go say hello.
There. It's gone. You shouldn't have any more trouble.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> If you do get any more problems with the lights then I'll get<eos> - my boyfriend round. - What is he a priest?<eos> No, he's an electrician.<eos> - Have you got a tenner? - For what?<eos> The witch services.<eos> We're paying her for this?<eos> I can throw in a quick tarot reading as part of the price.<eos> I sense a troubled soul in you.
Ronnie?<eos> No, it's God, you berk.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I've got a deal with that old wino Father Andrews for the communion plonk, it's Don Cortez cheap shit that's not been consecrated, but don't tell the Catholics.<eos> You don't believe in this old bollocks, do you, Vincent?<eos> No.<eos> Course not, it's a mug's game.<eos> Ronnie, you don't want to get a pint, do ya?<eos> I've got something I'd like to get your advice on.<eos> So what can I help you with, Vincent? Yeah, uhm...
Seriously though, what do you think?<eos> How does it make you feel?<eos> Unbelievably irritated.<eos> Irritated?<eos> Oh, I don't know, maybe because I'm playing second fiddle to a Paul Young sound-a-like jingle for my shithead, soon-to-be ex-husband's business.<eos> Paul Young sound-a-like?<eos> I created the bass hook on that bloody intro.<eos> Don't forget the name, Cachet Windows and Doors.<eos> Even when we're fucking escaping Vincent there's no escaping Vincent.<eos> I thought you liked our little secret rendezvous.
All right, saying it in French doesn't make it more romantic.<eos> I'm sick of sneaking around for quickies in lay-bys.<eos> - It's not a good time to go public. - What?<eos> !<eos> We're not Charles and Diana, the public don't give a shit.<eos> The only people that care will be the kids, and Nat and Robbie like you.<eos> Christ knows they want me to be happy.<eos> It's not just them though, is it, it's Vincent.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I love being with you.
I don't know.<eos> A cheque?<eos> - So, what is it?<eos> - Doesn't matter now.<eos> Oh, come on, don't leave me on meathooks.<eos> 50,000, cash.<eos> Ooh, way less than a million.<eos> - So, where did you get it?<eos> - Never you mind.<eos> I'll tell you where it's going, though,
Wow! Are you going get to meet the Queen?<eos> Not unless she works at a tax office in Southend-on-Sea.<eos> She doesn't.<eos> I'm pretty sure she works in London.<eos> Vincent, can I have a word?<eos> This sounds serious.<eos> Is Paul Young suing us about the ad?<eos> Let's go upstairs.<eos> Have you been upsetting him again?<eos> I know things haven't been easy between you and Sam, and the last thing I want is to add to your problems...

And be honest about how you feel, about how much she means to you.<eos> Deep down she needs to feel that she comes first.<eos> Christ, not even first, just not always last.<eos> Probably.<eos> That is good.<eos> I knew there was a reason why I employed - an overeducated ponce like you.<eos> Cachet Windows...<eos> Carol. What's up?<eos> Why are you whispering?<eos> Because your son's teacher is in the showroom and she wants to talk to you. She seems upset.
Don't call me fucking babe!<eos> Here she comes, the love of my life, your beautiful mother.<eos> All right, wish me luck.<eos> What the fuck is this, Vincent?<eos> Sorry, Robbie.<eos> This is our new family abode.<eos> Chez Swan.<eos> Are you deranged?<eos> We're getting a divorce.<eos> I don't want to live with you ever again, you terrible wanker.
Sorry, Robbie.<eos> Sam, I know I fucked up.<eos> Sorry, Robbie.<eos> You have every right to hate me, but I want you back.<eos> Plus, I've just put down a non-refundable deposit for ten grand on this place so, please, just have a look?<eos> Please, Mum, have a look.<eos> - It's fucking amazing in there.<eos> - Robbie!<eos> Right, Vincent, five minutes.<eos> Come on. After you.
And it is a deal breaker for us, I'm afraid, isn't it, Sam?<eos> Absolutely, Philip.<eos> How do you feel about that, Philip?<eos> Er, Okay.<eos> That's great stuff.<eos> Now can you pop downstairs and keep an eye on Robbie?<eos> We'll be with you shortly.<eos> You're such a plum.<eos> A great big sexy plum.<eos> Tony, there's a suit out there wants a word with you.
Depends. Who's looking for me? I mean him.<eos> Shit.<eos> Mr Walsh, I'm a legal representative for Farrell's Debt Collection.<eos> I'm serving Cachet Windows and Doors with a statutory demand for unpaid debts of £798,000<eos> Very good, you're very good.<eos> What? Did Vincent put you up to this?<eos> Is this a wind-up?<eos> If you do not respond to this demand within seven days, we'll file a winding-up petition at the High Court, after which your bank accounts will be frozen.<eos> Hello, mate. What's up?<eos> Look, I wasn't straight with you earlier today.
Look, I wasn't straight with you earlier today.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Look, mate, I'm kind of busy.<eos> It won't take long.<eos> I'm going to say what I've got to say,<eos> - then I'm going to go.<eos> - Okay. Don't be such a drama queen.<eos> It's Sam. What?<eos> What about Sam can't wait until tomorrow?<eos> No, it's Sam. Behind you.
Get it done.<eos> Okay, boss.<eos> I really enjoyed today's pep talk<eos> Pull!<eos> Vincent, my old mucker!<eos> What a wonderful day to be alive.<eos> How's the office shaping up?<eos> Nothing's really changed, other than your desk has arrived.<eos> What, the desk?<eos> Want me to get you one? Gorgeous, innit?
How's the office shaping up?<eos> Nothing's really changed, other than your desk has arrived.<eos> What, the desk?<eos> Want me to get you one? Gorgeous, innit?<eos> Not the fucking desk, Ronnie.<eos> Why did you take my name off the paperwork as a director?<eos> Because you're not a director, Vincent.<eos> Pull!<eos> Fuck me, Ronnie, do you have to?<eos> The deal was I helped you fuck over Walshy and then we run the business as partners.
The deal was I helped you fuck over Walshy and then we run the business as partners.<eos> Yeah, there's been a complication.<eos> It turns out that as a former director of Cachet you've been barred by the Companies House from becoming a director of the new business for five years.<eos> I'm sorry, mate, but it was unforeseen.<eos> Bollocks was it.<eos> Pull!<eos> What about my partnership?<eos> We can still be partners in the business, Vinny, just not in a legal sense.<eos> More like hombres.<eos> I'll tell you what, Ronnie, you can stick your hombres up your hombrarsehole.
All right, let's find out if our next competitor will have better luck battling the Beast.<eos> It's our very own Shaun Provost from the United States.<eos> Mentally, physically, I don't give up.<eos> A lot of people think if you're not a man, you don't have what it takes.<eos> I'm here to prove them all wrong.<eos> Nothing out there's gonna stop me.<eos> Wow, she has "little but fierce"<eos> and "pain is temporary"<eos> tattooed on her body.<eos> Let me tell you something, this lady is super strong.
She got it! She got it.<eos> She gains another ten points.<eos> All right, she's got one obstacle to go.<eos> It's the Mag Wall.<eos> Look how strong she is!<eos> You gotta breathe!<eos> Breathe!<eos> And it's all desire.<eos> But you have to stay focused, and that is exactly what she's doing.<eos> Let me tell you something.
So stoked!<eos> Level 2, I'm coming for you.<eos> With that incredible run, Shaun takes second place.<eos> But she wasn't the only one who rose to the challenge.<eos> Our next three competitors put on quite a show.<eos> Starting with Omar Zamitiz, a rehab trainer from Mexico.<eos> He's number one!<eos> Go, Omar!<eos> Go, Mexico!<eos> We're with you! Go, Omar!
Well, minus the trampoline park on the roof and the tunnel to my best friend's house.<eos> I am still holding out hope for a fireman's pole that takes you to the parking garage.<eos> Well, if you're sure you're finally ready.<eos> Of course I am.<eos> I just fixed the dryer. Hmm.<eos> And it was the most satisfying thing I've ever done.<eos> I'll just get dressed, I guess.<eos> Ta-da! Phil, I know where we are.<eos> I drove.<eos> You know what this is, but I'm about to tell you what this could be.
I don't want to hear any more.<eos> You're the most cautious guy I know when it comes to business.<eos> If you think this is a slam dunk, I'm in.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause I have an offer ready to go.<eos> - You say the word, I hit "send."<eos> - Do it.<eos> I've been looking for investment opportunities.<eos> If you're confident, I'm confident.<eos> Because you know what I'd do to you if you blew my money.
He's not even your coach.<eos> I need a scotch and a James Bond marathon.<eos> You may be out of luck.<eos> The TV wasn't working a minute ago.<eos> Sounds like the satellite dish.<eos> Big Hands probably messed it up poking around in my gutters.<eos> - Let me check it out.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> That might be very dangerous.<eos> Let me go grab Coach Gary, and he can help you.
The Prime Minister has declared a state of emergency in London.<eos> With supplies running low, humanitarian aid efforts are overwhelmed. You'll like it here.<eos> Following mass breakouts in migrant camps...<eos> Mr. Leigh, she's ready to see you, now.<eos> How do I look?<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Really?<eos> I want to come with you.

Mama misses you.<eos> Listen to this and see if it's any better, okay?<eos> How was school today? Yeah?<eos> Mommy's trying.<eos> I'm really trying.<eos> I hope Papa lets you message me back soon.<eos> I love you very much.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bea...<eos> God has plans for you.
I love you very much.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bea...<eos> God has plans for you.<eos> Incoming message.<eos> Sender unknown.<eos> Matthew 10:27.-.<eos> Lights off.<eos> Good morning.<eos> God has plans for you...
I met my wife.<eos> She turned my life around, brought me to God.<eos> Then you left her behind to come here.<eos> Then she died.<eos> Severin?<eos> Severin!<eos> It's the middle of the night.<eos> I need something stronger.<eos> Open wide.<eos> Can I stay with you?
I'm going to go in for external jug.<eos> - Where's that Valium?<eos> - Coming.<eos> - Here. Here.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I saw him standing there.<eos> Those brown eyes...<eos> What the hell is he talking about?<eos> We're losing him.<eos> May the Lord who frees you from sin save you and raise you up and grant you life everlasting.
My people are interested.<eos> They know you got good product, but they got their own hookup.<eos> Now, as much as I want to make this happen, I don't think they'll switch suppliers to save just one grand a kilo.<eos> Look, man, it's not good.<eos> It's the best.<eos> Take it to your people.<eos> Have them test it.<eos> Don't need to.<eos> No?<eos> You say it, I trust you, and if it was garbage, our customers ain't real choosy.
And there's no other potential suspects on this list?<eos> I vetted a dozen candidates:<eos> Decker's former colleagues, high school chums, even some online associates.<eos> None of them seem remotely capable of keeping Preeda Boonark in human bondage.<eos> Well, they're in here somewhere and we are gonna find them.<eos> I thought Shinwell was coming over for a lesson.<eos> He was, but he's been very busy lately.<eos> He's working on a drug deal.<eos> It's taking up all of his time.<eos> He's eager to impress the, heads of SBK, and that doesn't concern you.
Hendrix, that was quite the feed.<eos> Was that a cream-cheese frosting?<eos> - I don't know, is it?<eos> - Oh, you are evil, - Alison Hendrix.<eos> - I'll email you the recipe.
I'm sorry.<eos> - You're the other one.<eos> - Yeah, I'm Cosima.<eos> I'm sorry about this whole ambush thing.<eos> It was totally Beth's idea.<eos> She just thought it would be a good idea for you to see - another one of us.<eos> - You have a nose ring.<eos> Yeah, brilliant observation.<eos> - We are so completely different.<eos> - I know, which you may find totally freaky, but I find it...
I'm expected on stage at the Fall Fun Fair.<eos> So go, dance with the stars.<eos> No law says you have to stick around.<eos> Are we cool, Donnie?<eos> Yeah, we're cool.<eos> Just... keep 'em out of the garage.<eos> Do you remember your car accident, Kira?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ms. S said it was a miracle.<eos> What if I told you it might not be a miracle at all.
- A mouse!<eos> - Mm-hmm! - Aww! - This is a spiny mouse.<eos> This mouse has the remarkable ability to grow back its own skin and fur.<eos> - How?<eos> - That is the mystery.<eos> Can I pick him up?<eos> Sure.<eos> He's evolved this way so that, when he's grasped by a predator, he slides right out of his own skin and escapes.<eos> - I think it's rather painless.<eos> Everybody says I can't trust you.
No.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why don't you get ready for bed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Alison?<eos> Hey, Chad. May I, uh, may I sit?<eos> Sure.<eos> You used to call me "Hendrix."<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I used to do a lot of things, huh?<eos> Hey, are you Okay?
Why don't you get ready for bed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Alison?<eos> Hey, Chad. May I, uh, may I sit?<eos> Sure.<eos> You used to call me "Hendrix."<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I used to do a lot of things, huh?<eos> Hey, are you Okay?<eos> No.<eos> There's something I should have told you about Aynsley's death.
It was an accident.<eos> Dr. Leekie pushed Donnie over the edge, and he didn't have basic firearm safety.<eos> Aldous Leekie is buried in your garage?<eos> Minus the head which was donated to science.<eos> For most of my life, I hated Aldous.<eos> But I chose not to kill him.<eos> The other body, who is it?<eos> A Castor.<eos> Tell me Helena's location, and this all goes away.<eos> Even if I knew where she was, I wouldn't tell you.

- It's Rachel.<eos> Something's come up on my end.<eos> I need to know what you found, Detective.<eos> Ma'am, there's a body here, but, um, we can't ID it just yet.<eos> What, uh, what would you like us to do?<eos> Well, dispose of the bodies discreetly and put the garage back in order.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll stand down.<eos> Looks like the Hendrixes squirmed out of this one.<eos> What would you have me do with you now?
Yes. What is the big deal? I buy beds for people every day.<eos> Yeah, with their money, not ours.<eos> I know you love your college friends, but when you see them, you all become bitches, all the sniping and showing off.<eos> You don't have to show off. We don't have to compete.<eos> What's the girl's name?<eos> Pizza.<eos> - Her name is not Pizza, it's Lisa.<eos> - Right, yeah.<eos> And I'm not competing with them, I'm talking about them, I'm processing.<eos> I'm trying to download with you.
This seems dangerous.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Problem solved.<eos> - We'll pay for that.<eos> [Ethan] Look at this thing. It's like we're in a Black Mirror episode.<eos> - Stupid looking truck.<eos> - At least it has a roof.<eos> Look at how she's dressed, it's Black Mirror.<eos> Hi! It's so good to see you guys!<eos> - [Sam] Thank you for coming. - [Lisa] Hey, how are you?
What?<eos> To Kill a Mockingbird gave birth to the entire genre.<eos> - Harper Lee is a national treasure.<eos> - [Marianne] I love Judy Blume.<eos> Harry Potter.<eos> I'd read one of those books every year.<eos> I mean, it's all I have time for.<eos> You don't work. You have nothing but time.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Why don't you go get in your truck and go find Jason Bourne?
Oh, God, I'm so worried about work today.<eos> I wish I wasn't working at a hedge fund.<eos> That's just first day of school jitters, okay?<eos> You're going to be the smartest person in the place.<eos> Remember that.<eos> It's not that.<eos> It's... the evil.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> - Oh, God, give it to me.<eos> - I'm going to give it to you.
- I need a huge favor.<eos> - Anything.<eos> I need you to take Anastasia to the vet for a check-up.<eos> I'd do it, but I'm the only point person between the YMCA and production.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Why not?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You're the best.<eos> I'll text you the doctor's information. - Okay.
We're bad people.<eos> - Hey, don't be so hard on yourself.<eos> - I said "we"!<eos> My husband was in the next room.<eos> Your wife was downstairs.<eos> - My children were asleep in their beds.<eos> - I know!<eos> What happened to the "let's just be friends" plan?<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> This has been going on for so long, I have no idea what to tell you.
Neither did I. I said you were not.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know why I keep getting hung up on this.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> What can I do?<eos> How can I make it better?<eos> Well, I mean, you can come into the city and take me for lunch.<eos> It'd be nice to see the face of a decent human being.<eos> I wish that I could, but I'm...<eos> I'm still at the vet with Marianne's rabbit.<eos> It's nice of you to take care of it.
Whoa.<eos> Lots of hits.<eos> North Fork?<eos> They make wine on Long Island?<eos> - Washing dishes, huh?<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> - Can you stop staring at me?<eos> - But you're so pretty.<eos> Why are you doing a 1940s guy?<eos> I just wanted to see if you're okay.
Why don't we go wine-tasting?<eos> - Wine-tasting?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, I think I'd rather just stay in and watch a dumb movie and sleep.<eos> Very cool.<eos> Or... we could round up the crew and get a party bus and go check it out.<eos> - A party bus? - Yeah!<eos> Yeah, it'll be great.<eos> I really think we need this.<eos> I think it would be good for us and I am positive it would make you feel better.
I didn't know you were being serious.<eos> 5% to 6% of the time it doesn't work because of lab error.<eos> Oh, weird.<eos> Well, I guess 95% of the time it is what we think it is - a failed IVF cycle.<eos> I know, but 5% to 6% is huge.<eos> I mean... why would he tell me that?<eos> That's like as if Marianne out of our group just disappeared.<eos> It's more like if a quarter of Marianne disappeared.<eos> - Are you listening?<eos> - Of course, but I don't want you to worry.
Welcome home, man!<eos> I'm still on the plane.<eos> I'm gonna call Ethan.<eos> He's right here, man.<eos> You want to talk to him, man?<eos> No, I don't want to do that.<eos> I don't want him to even know that this is me.<eos> Can you take a few steps away from him?<eos> Alright.<eos> You look so hot in those goggles, bro.

- No. - Yes. - No, you are not.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes, I am, Sam.<eos> I am, Sam.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> Stop!<eos> I am Sam and you are not telling her anything!<eos> I'm going to tell her.<eos> I wanted you to know.<eos> This is a decision that we make together and I forbid you from talking about it.
We're having a party.<eos> - That's what you do when you turn 40.<eos> - Well, I don't want to.<eos> I wish you'd told me that six months ago.<eos> I did.<eos> Come on, it's gonna be great.<eos> You're gorgeous.<eos> Can you...<eos> I wonder if there's time for me to take a nap.<eos> Does it ever creep you out living in this house?
- What's your plan?<eos> - My plan is to tell her about us. Before she brings it up first, okay?<eos> Did you see how she just greeted me?<eos> - She definitely knows.<eos> - She does not.<eos> - She knows.<eos> - That is an insane plan.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I need to talk to you.
Don't they sell sunblock in the Caymans?<eos> Look, I haven't had a second to talk to Ethan yet.<eos> - So just...<eos> - Me, neither.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I've been wanting to tell him everything to his face.<eos> Stop it, this isn't funny, okay?<eos> I'm not gonna be able to talk to him until we leave so let that inform your behavior.<eos> Fine. Yeah.<eos> Lisa, I want to introduce you to my fiancée, Dustry.
This is my fiancée, Dustry.<eos> We're engaged to be married.<eos> - Well, congratulations.<eos> - I know, I was like...<eos> Just like...<eos> - Like...<eos> - Yeah, I was, too.<eos> - Bear, you're so cute!<eos> - You're cute, Bug.<eos> I want to show you these bouquets.
She wasn't. I found her outside by the pool.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is my rabbit.<eos> Not the imposter one that you tried to pass off on me, whom I love now, too.<eos> I don't know what this is.<eos> I'm going back to the party.<eos> Sam, get over here now.<eos> You were supposed to take her to the vet, yet she ended up here, 50 miles away in Connecticut, in Sam's house, which means you two are still having an affair.<eos> Hang on, how does she know about us?<eos> Sam, when you told me that it was over, I believed you.

Cake!<eos> Come on, cake!<eos> Cake, cake! Cake!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Cake!<eos> Babe, I'm so sorry.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I have no idea what happened.<eos> I was out of my mind.<eos> I think... after the wedding... I got crazy and I got paranoid and I thought something was happening between you and Sam.

- E.T.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Get in a basket and go back to space, you freak!<eos> It's good to meet you.<eos> Wow!<eos> What you've done is... very good.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I am such a huge fan.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> - Shawna, how are you?
- I did.<eos> - What kind of agent are you?<eos> - A bad one.<eos> No, I was just kidding.<eos> So, I hear you want to try your hand at young adult fiction.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> This is the most interesting thing happening in publishing today for the reader and writer.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> You are aware that the audience is predominantly female?
Yeah.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - I'm sure.<eos> I mean, I think we have enough food.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He said yes.<eos> - We'll still watch Damages, right?<eos> - Come over now.<eos> Hey!<eos> How are you?
- I'm about to score on you.<eos> What?<eos> - That's what we call defense!<eos> - Nice defense.<eos> - 7:00 a.m.<eos> - Pardon me?<eos> I have surgery at 7:00 a.m.<eos> Oh, God, I'm sorry.<eos> - It's alright, I'm not sleeping yet.<eos> - That's sweet of you.
- I don't know.<eos> A horse?<eos> - Your wife supports you, okay?<eos> She toils every day in drudgery and you do nothing to support her!<eos> - What creature are you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I spend all day looking at boring apartments, running women's errands and banging my head against a wall trying to figure out a genre that I'm too old for!<eos> I am 40 years old! The drawbridge is going up, man!<eos> It's now or never for me!<eos> - What does that make you want to do?
Shawna, look.<eos> Shawna?<eos> We lost her.<eos> She's not...<eos> Shawna?<eos> She's decided what the most important thing at the table is and it's not us.<eos> Excuse me, Shawna?<eos> Look.<eos> Bathtub moments are your specialty.<eos> They are who you are.
- Perfect for fingernail marks.<eos> - That's better than my thing.<eos> - Smooth back.<eos> What is going on here?<eos> Who are these guys and why is Fogo de Chão open?<eos> - We'll talk about it later.<eos> - It's my Fogo de Chão.<eos> - I'm a franchise owner.<eos> - Three.<eos> - You have three of these?
I was.<eos> And it is.<eos> But then she made the first move.<eos> Tonight's actually date number three.<eos> I can't believe you didn't tell me.<eos> I didn't want to jinx anything.<eos> Speaking of which, I should probably get going.<eos> I'll let you know when I've touched base with your stepdad.<eos> Okay, but I better know the details about your new girlfriend before he does.<eos> You're five minutes away, and you want me to order you a Merlot.
No wallet, no phone.<eos> But Mount Pleasant's a small place.<eos> If he's one of ours, we'll hear about it.<eos> You said the second clown made a beeline for these woods.<eos> That's right.<eos> So, by all accounts, the clowns were stalking Mount Pleasant, the town, this one died in the woods, the other one ran through here, so...<eos> What's on the other side?<eos> We didn't make plans last night that I forgot?<eos> Nope.<eos> I just need to talk to you a minute.
For the time being, yes, I am.<eos> The usual suspects?<eos> Already moved off them, actually.<eos> How was your, visit to Farlane's?<eos> Anything productive?<eos> Aside from the light buzz you're feeling from the Belgian White, was it?<eos> I was at a bar.<eos> Seemed like a better idea than drinking the water.<eos> The attack was thwarted, Watson.<eos> Don't let your lizard brain run away with you.
Hey, I was just getting ready to go see Marcus at the precinct.<eos> So it's true.<eos> The shaved bear I met upstairs installed a water filtration system?<eos> Okay, first, that shaved bear got over 600 reviews on Ratelt as the best plumber in the city.<eos> Second, until someone can find Raymond Thorpe and get him to explain why he wanted to make everyone sick, I thought we should take extra precautions on our water.<eos> This is the model the D.E.P.'s Web site recommends for filtering out germs like the one that Thorpe made.<eos> Well, one of the reasons I chose to live in New York, as opposed to other American cities, was the quality of its water.<eos> The taste and odor, unmatched.<eos> This glorified strainer is going to change that.<eos> Now, I suppose I shouldn't blame you for falling prey to the hydro-hysteria sweeping the city.
This glorified strainer is going to change that.<eos> Now, I suppose I shouldn't blame you for falling prey to the hydro-hysteria sweeping the city.<eos> The leak that Agent Breslin mentioned last night is, in fact, a geyser.<eos> Look.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now remarkably, one of the only publications to look past the hysteria and explore the consequences of Thorpe's actions, was this one. The Daily Newswire?<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> I can see the paper is mostly bollocks, but the metro reporter is tip-top.<eos> Every New Yorker knows...<eos> Every New Yorker aside from you, that is... That their water is the champagne of municipal hydration, because it arrives virtually untouched from the most pristine watershed in the country.
Dean Ambrose wrestled Samoa Joe for the WWE Championship.<eos> And Samoa Joe is about to hit him with the muscle buster, but then Ambrose put him into a crossface chickenwing.<eos> Then Samoa Joe reversed into his submission finisher, the Coquina Clutch.<eos> Okay, I-I'm not sure I follow, but that sounds entertaining.<eos> You think if I was a wrestler... my name could be Samosa Joe?<eos> Samosa Joe?<eos> Like the savory Indian snack?<eos> Just a play on Samoa Joe?<eos> No, it's Samoa Joe... like, from the Isle of Samoa.<eos> Can I ask you a question that you might find a little offensive?
- Yeah, that's...<eos> - Ridiculous.<eos> - I've never seen a white person do that. - I've n... - It's...<eos> It should be off limits, right?<eos> It definitely should be.<eos> Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.<eos> I really need to get this.<eos> - I'll be right back.<eos> - All right.<eos> ♪ ♪ So I got to give you props.
- I'll be right back.<eos> - All right.<eos> ♪ ♪ So I got to give you props.<eos> I really enjoyed your opening message to me.<eos> - Oh, thanks.<eos> - Be honest, though.<eos> - Is that a line you send to everyone?<eos> - What?<eos> No. I would never do such a thing.<eos> I don't believe you.

Oh, man, uh... I don't want to freak you out, but your show helped me through a tough time.<eos> My friend was going through chemo, and we would watch Clash of the Cupcakes together, and your upbeat attitude, it got us through, man.<eos> She's totally healthy now, and I think you had a big part to do with that.<eos> Uh, I'm really flattered.<eos> You know, I was just doing the gig, hosting the show.<eos> Not to me, man. Not to me.<eos> What's the craziest thing you've ever done?<eos> Ever?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll tell you mine.
‐ How long? ‐ 15 years.<eos> ‐ Our daughter...<eos> I want to see her.<eos> I'm climbing the rungs with Richard and Felicia, and when I am ready, I am going to replace Cal.<eos> ‐ You have to let me go.<eos> ‐ I can't do that. ‐ You have to.<eos> ‐ I am not cut out for this, Richard!<eos> I don't want the responsibility of other people's lives!<eos> I can barely deal with my own!<eos> Cal offered us a house if I broke up with you?
you know, I understand...<eos> Completely.<eos> But, um... I need you to know that... I'm in.<eos> I'm all‐in.<eos> Hey, great work on that landscaping, Aaron. ‐ Thanks, Cal.<eos> ‐ I saw those new pamphlets, Luis.<eos> They look good. ‐ Good for you.<eos> Eddie.<eos> What... ‐ I know. Aah!<eos> I know about you and Sarah.
‐ You really gonna do this, hmm?<eos> - In my house? - ‐<eos> ‐ You're a Denier, Eddie.<eos> I say the word, there'll be 20 kids in here to throw you on the street in a second. ‐ You're pathetic.<eos> ‐ We never meant to hurt you.<eos> ‐ Are you fucking serious?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> She may have settled for you, but she chose me... just like Steve.<eos> You know, he said you were a disappointment. ‐ How did you get that?<eos> It doesn't belong to you.
‐ Are you fucking serious?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> She may have settled for you, but she chose me... just like Steve.<eos> You know, he said you were a disappointment. ‐ How did you get that?<eos> It doesn't belong to you.<eos> ‐ See, that's where... you're wrong.<eos> I was with Steve when he died, and he told me that he put his faith in the wrong man.<eos> ‐ You...you...you were not with him.<eos> ‐ Oh, but I was.<eos> And you think that I can't touch you?
‐ What if it doesn't work? ‐ It takes time.<eos> When you get out, return to your daily life, the effects of the meditation will take hold.<eos> ‐ It didn't work for Dad.<eos> ‐ I read your unburdening report.<eos> I know that you were with Ashley.<eos> Is there anything else?<eos> Have you seen your dad lately?<eos> It's one more night.<eos> And you are not your father, Hawk.<eos> The Light radiates in you.
The Light radiates in you.<eos> ‐ Kneel.<eos> The key to mending is forgiveness and specificity... precision.<eos> When someone says...<eos> "If I've ever done anything to hurt you, I'm sorry"...<eos> It's not a mending, but an equivocation.<eos> ‐ Resentment... and vagueness... are what darkness and disease feed and flourish on.<eos> You only need to open yourself as wide as the eye of a needle.<eos> That is room enough for The Light to enter you...<eos> To forgive you... And mend your wounds.

Why did he do that? ‐ You know, these sessions are about you and your child.<eos> How does that question pertain to your unborn child?<eos> ‐ Did the outside world make him crazy? ‐ Are you thinking about the outside world?<eos> ‐ Sean's parents want us to leave.<eos> They've offered to buy us a house, set us up with a life.<eos> ‐ I see.<eos> Well, what do you want, Mary?<eos> ‐ You've blossomed into a beautiful woman, an example others look to.<eos> It's true.<eos> I know it's hard for you to look at yourself and see the power in you, but I see it, and you're radiant.
But the IS world still has all the things that you ran from.<eos> So I want you to think hard about the world you'd be returning to.<eos> And you have to make the decision here.<eos> I can't make it for you, and neither can Sean or his parents.<eos> You need to make the right decision for you and your baby.<eos> Is there something else?<eos> Something here?<eos> The person, the man that you think might be the father of your child?<eos> ‐ Sean needs to get away from him.<eos> ‐ Who is that man? ‐ I can't tell you.
I don't know what to do.<eos> ‐ Let them hash it out.<eos> ‐ No, I‐I just... In the program, I was thinking about him a lot, and... now he really wants to see me.<eos> And it's just...<eos> Meditation's supposed to help you find clarity, and...<eos> I'm, uh... Just all messed up again.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Have you heard anything more about Eddie... how he might've found out?<eos> ‐ No, I haven't. I'm sorry.<eos> ‐ I've been calling him, and he keeps sending me to voice mail, so... ‐ I guess he doesn't want to talk to you.
And if there's anything I can do to make the transition as easy as possible, please don't...<eos> ‐ That's really, um...<eos> I've been rude for long enough.<eos> I'm sorry to have disturbed you.<eos> ‐ You okay?<eos> ‐ Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> ‐ I think they're gonna let us go.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> ‐ I'm not. ‐ Hey...<eos> I, uh... I came here looking for a new life, and I found it with you.

Penetti's biggest campaign donor.<eos> The blackmail victims that I have lined up for Penetti are pieces of shit... but none of them are a DeKaan... poisoning and killing entire towns for a buck.<eos> They're playing me, man.<eos> ‐ Are you kidding me?<eos> Really? Name me one person who isn't being played.<eos> ‐ Come on, I'm supposed to be playing for the good guys.<eos> ‐ Oh, come on, man, you're supposed to be playing for the team who's paying you.<eos> Just get me a date.<eos> Don't make me come out to bumblefuck again.<eos> ‐ What happened to you?
A lot's been going on. ‐ Yeah, seems like it.<eos> ‐ Yeah, look, um... your mother and I have grown close.<eos> Now, we weren't trying to keep it a secret from you. ‐ No?<eos> ‐ Just 'cause we're older, you know, doesn't mean we have stuff figured out.<eos> ‐ Apparently.<eos> ‐ And...and it's...<eos> it's gonna be hard.<eos> As complicated as your relationship is with your dad, it's still hard to accept a new man in your life.<eos> Look, um...<eos> I know you missed restitution to be with Ashley, and I'm sure she told you that I offered her family a place to live last year when they were homeless.

‐ I didn't want to believe her.<eos> Why'd you do it?<eos> ‐ For you.<eos> I did it for you, Hawk.<eos> If I hadn't, would you have chosen to stay and...and walk in The Light and help this commu...<eos> help lead this community?<eos> ‐ So you thought you'd make that decision for me?<eos> ‐ Man‐to‐man? ‐ Yes.<eos> Please.<eos> ‐ She chose a house over you.
‐ He loves her, Dad.<eos> We have to accept that.<eos> ‐ Right, but what about her?<eos> What about your mom?<eos> Does she love him, too?<eos> Tell me.<eos> ‐ You have to let her go, Dad, and you have to let me go.<eos> You can't stalk me.<eos> Don't send Ashley to me.<eos> ‐ I didn't send her to you, okay?
You know, you could relinquish your guilt for Cal, but why don't you tell me the rest of the horrible things you've done this past year?<eos> I am done trying to protect you!<eos> Take responsibility, Sarah, for the horrible shit you have done.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> ‐ It's Richard.<eos> Leave me a message, and I will return your call.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I messed up.<eos> I told Sarah.<eos> She might come to you.
Eddie...<eos> My name isn't Sam.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> ‐ Painting flowers on your walls of doom.<eos> Your necklace... where is it?<eos> ‐ Oh, I gave it to the worthy one.<eos> ‐ I earned the necklace!<eos> I earned it!<eos> ♪ Hush, little baby, don't say a word ♪<eos> ♪ Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird ♪

Sarah, should No!<eos> He abused his position and betrayed my trust. My trust.<eos> And you destabilized our community.<eos> You have been selfish and petty and deceitful.<eos> You have to go.<eos> What have you done, Felicia?<eos> I'm so sorry, love. You said you were in Peru.<eos> I took no joy in deceiving youl wanted to be sure before I told you.<eos> Before I risked<eos> I know how comfortable you are with our life, with what we have.
She supports you.<eos> We want this to be over, Felicia.<eos> I know we've had our differences, but we'd like you to stand with us.<eos> Richard is gone.<eos> You made a mistake.<eos> We all do.<eos> Own it... atone.<eos> Go back to San Diego.<eos> I won't do any of those things.<eos> I have nothing to atone for, especially not to you.
I wish I hadn't believed that you lost your worth when you lost your faith.<eos> Well, you did.<eos> Goodbye, Jeremiah.<eos> You've reached Sarah Lane's voicemail.<eos> Please leave a message.<eos> Hi, hi, hi...<eos> I just wanted to, um<eos> I know that there's been some struggle and...<eos> I completely understand. You didn't call last night, so, um...<eos> I just wanted to make sure that you're okay.

Who?<eos> What?<eos> Cal, you have to tell me.<eos> You said you'd treat me like a peer.<eos> Um... your mom told me that she... she had a fight with your dad before she was chased off the road, and hehe threatened her What did he say?<eos> That she would be punished.<eos> Hawk, we have no proof, all right?<eos> ThisThis is No.<eos> II know.<eos> But... I promise you, Hawk, if he did anything to hurt her, I will not let him get away with it.
You made it, then?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're a tough one, aren't you?<eos> Ravn?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Hiding back there today?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Incredible.<eos> Look, I've told you a hundred times, it can't be anyone but me.
- What was the deal with the coffin?<eos> - Grandma and Grandpa wanted one.<eos> - People will think she's in it.<eos> - I explained that. She's out there somewhere!<eos> Are they just going to stop looking?<eos> Can I have a hug?<eos> I need some stuff from home.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Call me, and we'll arrange it.<eos> And I need to talk to you about something important...

He can't.<eos> They'll kill him if he goes to prison.<eos> - Because he hurt a cop?<eos> - Not the cops.<eos> The other robbers.<eos> That's just conspiracy theories you and your chatroom buddies swap.<eos> Since 1995, 68 inmates have died in prison.<eos> Only ten were suicides.<eos> Come. - Where?<eos> - I'll show you something.
- They probably knew about that.<eos> - I think so too.<eos> They must have. But how did they know?<eos> That's what I'm asking myself.<eos> - You think it was me?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - But that's what you think.<eos> - We did talk about it.<eos> That night, I said we were low on people because of the state visit.<eos> Just between you and me, as usual.
- You know.<eos> Survival in the forest.<eos> Stockpiling canned food, making clean water from piss...<eos> - You know those kinds of people. - I know of them.<eos> True.<eos> I've never ever heard of anyone named Nøstvik.<eos> - Naustvik.<eos> - Naustvik.<eos> Never heard of him.<eos> But Leif, the information I give you when we meet...
Never.<eos> I feel a little taken aback by this.<eos> It's upsetting. Knowing you think that way about me after all these years.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's too much right now.<eos> I have to go, I'm working.<eos> - Let me know if you hear anything.<eos> - I promise.<eos> That night, I said, we're low on people...<eos> Just between you and me, as usual.
- Hello, Ravn. - Hi.<eos> How are you, Ravn?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I'm working on something really exciting, actually.<eos> But I need access to equipment here.<eos> - What's it about?<eos> - I can't say much.<eos> It's for the Civil Defence, so it's classified information.<eos> I was thinking of what you said at Vilma's funeral.<eos> - That I could come to you for help.

Anything.<eos> A mass spectrometer? You've got several.<eos> They're not being used round the clock.<eos> I can't give you expensive equipment. I know. You don't have to.

You don't have to.<eos> I just need you to...<eos> Just open the door.<eos> I'll do the rest.<eos> Ravn, are you really OK?
Mmm... The only thing more annoying than my dad making coffee at 5:30 in the morning is my mom saying:<eos> "Chuck, be quiet.<eos> Abby's still sleeping."<eos> Did you take your vitamins?"<eos> "I don't need the damn vitamins!"<eos> "Well, Dr. Randall says you do."<eos> "Janice, do we have to do this now?" Oh, they fucking did it then.<eos> Anyway, still smoking.<eos> That sounds really tough.<eos> I'm just happy to be here with you.
"Solicitors welcome."<eos> You know, I... I gotta...<eos> I'm beat.<eos> - I... Is it okay if we just hang out?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, no problem.<eos> Cool.<eos> Hey, you know what might make you feel better?<eos> - What's that?<eos> - A little fuckin'.<eos> Maggie, I'd like you to meet my girlfriend, Shirley.
Yeah. Not my first choice, running into him here.<eos> Already having a shit day.<eos> Any chance you're gonna deal with that by not getting drunk?<eos> You know, you got weird moral lines for a woman who owns a bar, Mom.<eos> So what happened?<eos> New job's killing me.<eos> Got into a fight with Mary over my dumb-ass brother...<eos> Now I gotta go home to Umberto and five other guys in some shitty apartment.<eos> You know, one of them assholes ate my Cocoa Puffs.<eos> Yeah, I know you've always been very protective about your cereal.
It's only 7:55.<eos> Beau Bennett.<eos> Brenda Sanders.<eos> Well, we've got some brown and some blonde on the floor already.<eos> I guess we could add some gray.<eos> Where you been?<eos> Well, I've been getting my hair cut at Sport Clips up near Grand Junction.<eos> Oh, so what brought you back?<eos> They started putting soccer on the TVs.<eos> Well, they didn't do you any favors with your hair.
Well, it's just a hazard of the job, you know.<eos> People tell their hairdresser everything.<eos> But that's why I like spending time with you because you are not here to gossip.<eos> That's right.<eos> You heard about Bill down at the pharmacy?<eos> Beau Bennett, you are better than that.<eos> So what have you been up to?<eos> Uh, let's see.<eos> Um... Oh, I got a collie named Dolly.<eos> Silly, I know, but you would really like her.
Well, I've never been much for hiking.<eos> If I'm going into the woods, I'm gonna come out with a carcass on my shoulder.<eos> Oh, I also got into yoga.<eos> And you should try that.<eos> It would be great for your back.<eos> And if I go into a yoga studio, I'm gonna come out with a carcass on my shoulder.<eos> I've missed this, Beau.<eos> I've missed it, too.<eos> So, what are you gonna gouge me for this haircut?<eos> I'll tell you what.
I've missed it, too.<eos> So, what are you gonna gouge me for this haircut?<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> You buy me dinner sometime and we'll call it even.<eos> I can do that.<eos> Just tell me how much this haircut would've cost so I'll know where to take you.<eos> Colt?<eos> Hey, Ab.<eos> What are you doing up?<eos> I just... I reached for you and you weren't there.
So... I went for the light and knocked over one of your trophies and it hit me in the forehead.<eos> Thank God you weren't good enough to win a Heisman, I'd have a fucking concussion.<eos> Sorry, I just... couldn't sleep.<eos> All right, what's going on?<eos> You don't wanna have sex.<eos> You didn't react to the fact that I said you sucked at football.<eos> Are you dying?<eos> You've been acting weird since I got back.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I don't... I don't even know if I should tell you.
No.<eos> Okay. It's just...<eos> Heather's pregnant.<eos> What?<eos> Heather's pregnant.<eos> Jesus, Colt.<eos> No.<eos> Abby, I didn't... I didn't cheat on you.<eos> It was the time that you knew about.<eos> I would have told you earlier, but...
Damn.<eos> I just need to finish this.<eos> Uh... before you say anything...<eos> After the other night, I went home, and I put a cigarette out on our prom picture.<eos> And our winter formal picture.<eos> Not our homecoming picture, 'cause my hair looked fuckin' awesome.<eos> I never wanted to think about you again.<eos> I was so pissed at you.<eos> Then I started worryin' about how you were doin', which pissed me off even more.<eos> So, how you doin', you fuckin' asshole?
Who am I gonna be mad at? Heather, for wanting to keep her baby?<eos> You, for wanting to support her? The baby?<eos> It's a fucking baby!<eos> - I get that this... - I'm not done!<eos> Okay?<eos> What's the deal, huh?<eos> You're just gonna... Have a kid with another woman and I'm supposed to go along with it?<eos> Well, say somethin'!<eos> I don't know what to say. I...<eos> I love you, and I wanna be with you, but I also... I get how messed up all this is.

I get how messed up all this is.<eos> Yeah, it really is.<eos> I'm not gettin' you a fuckin' baby shower gift.
Damn.<eos> It's like what the pope would drive if he was a redneck.<eos> - Where'd you get this?<eos> - Got it last night from Neumann's Hill.<eos> Just one of the perks.<eos> Along with my self-respect and a fat weekly paycheck.<eos> How you doin', Colt?<eos> Still throwin' up trash bag windows?<eos> That's cool.<eos> So they just gave you this, huh?
What does this guy have to do to make you realize you shouldn't be with him?<eos> - Dad.<eos> - No, I'm serious.<eos> Does he have to knock somebody else up?<eos> Get arrested?<eos> - Break your heart for the umpteenth time?<eos> - Chuck, maybe this isn't the time.<eos> Of course it is. You wanna wait till she's pregnant?<eos> Abby, I love you.<eos> And I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life.
We allowed to do that?<eos> Here you go.<eos> Hi, Heather. What's with all the blondes?<eos> Is this a Viking town?<eos> I'm just gonna say it.<eos> This is fuckin' weird.<eos> Yeah. - I'm just here to pick up some food.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. I was at the gas station. I was gonna get one of those hotdogs on the rollers, and then I realized I'm at the gas station and I'm gonna get one of those hotdogs on the rollers.<eos> There was a... flood.<eos> Well... how are you doing?
You're gonna be a grandma.<eos> - What's that all about?<eos> Oh, God. "Grandma"?<eos> Maybe I'll be "Nana Maggie." No, that's sounds worse. Sounds like an old goat.<eos> You know what's worse?<eos> "Stepmom Abby." Ugh.<eos> The new art teacher's a stepmom.<eos> She wears clogs.<eos> I will not wear clogs, Nana Maggie.<eos> Why don't I get you a blanket?
Abby, wait.<eos> You don't know the whole story.<eos> - Heather's gettin' a 'bortion.<eos> - It doesn't make it better.<eos> You have to listen to me. - Abby...<eos> - I don't have to fuckin' listen to you!<eos> I don't have to talk to you!
Hey, you just hit me with a fuckin' rat!<eos> I did?<eos> Even when I'm not tryin', I got a better arm than you.<eos> Whatcha doin' out here?<eos> Saw smoke... thought some creepy pervert was stayin' out here.<eos> I was right.<eos> Yeah, this place is mine now.<eos> Mom's lettin' me live out here.<eos> What?<eos> She got you a job, and now she's lettin' you live in the cabin?
Yeah, this place is mine now.<eos> Mom's lettin' me live out here.<eos> What?<eos> She got you a job, and now she's lettin' you live in the cabin?<eos> She won't even give me her Netflix password.<eos> Well, if you had two kids and only loved one of 'em, isn't that what you'd do?<eos> Look at this place.<eos> Used to be fuckin' awesome.<eos> Now it's a mess.<eos> Yeah, it's like the house version of you.
Oh, hey, Dale, you left your beer here!<eos> That's weird.<eos> Have we met before?<eos> Because... you look very familiar.<eos> Yeah, my family transferred to Garrison my senior year.<eos> I think you were a freshman.<eos> You probably remember me as, you know, the only black guy.<eos> Oh, shit, Rich!<eos> What's up, dude?<eos> Man, what happened to you after high school?
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I've been meanin' to get to those.<eos> Hey, did you fuck Tracy Jenkins back in high school?<eos> Rooster, I'm really gonna need those reports.<eos> And yes... yes, I did.<eos> Man, that is fuckin' awesome.<eos> Damn it, Dale, you know?<eos> And speaking of Dale, you're not gonna be able to hire him, 'cause he's not on our approved list of vets.<eos> - What? No one told me that.<eos> - I did.<eos> I e-mailed it to you.
Damn it, Dale, you know?<eos> And speaking of Dale, you're not gonna be able to hire him, 'cause he's not on our approved list of vets.<eos> - What? No one told me that.<eos> - I did.<eos> I e-mailed it to you.<eos> The subject of the e-mail was, "Vets you can and cannot hire."<eos> Yeah, about that, um... you know, they hired me here to run this ranch 'cause they trust my judgment.<eos> Now, I've worked with Dale my entire life, and he's the best vet in the state.<eos> So... I'm gonna hire him here.<eos> Hey, man, if you feel that strongly about it, I say good for you. Go for it.
All right, cool, thanks.<eos> Yeah, thing is, Neumann's Hill's not gonna pay for it, so that's comin' out of your pocket.<eos> Well, maybe I could just take a look at the rest of these vets on here.<eos> All right, Daddy-o, I got spinach, artichoke and chicken panini, or Thai-style chicken spring rolls.<eos> I want that steak you burned up.<eos> Yeah, sorry about that.<eos> My mind's kind of been all over the place.<eos> I take it you haven't heard from Abby.<eos> No. She made it pretty clear she wants her space.<eos> I thought I made the same thing pretty clear to you, but here you are.
She's really pissed.<eos> What if it's over?<eos> What if I can't get her back?<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll take the spring roll.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got a lot of nerve, tellin' Rooster he could live in the cabin without talkin' to me.<eos> Beau, that is my cabin now.<eos> I have no obligation to tell you anything.
I'll take the spring roll.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got a lot of nerve, tellin' Rooster he could live in the cabin without talkin' to me.<eos> Beau, that is my cabin now.<eos> I have no obligation to tell you anything.<eos> We're divorced.<eos> By the way, nice haircut.<eos> Who did it?<eos> I have no obligation to tell you anything.
Who did it?<eos> I have no obligation to tell you anything.<eos> - We're divorced.<eos> - How's Brenda?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> She gave me a great haircut.<eos> Want to see the back?<eos> I need a whiskey.<eos> Oh, hey, comin' right up.<eos> Look at this... me pouring' a drink for you.
Oh, right, we're talkin' about the other woman that hates me.<eos> Well, Colt, I'm sure there's more than two women who hate you.<eos> Try to imagine what it would be like to be a 23-year-old woman in a small town getting an abortion.<eos> I mean, she feels like everybody's judging her, including you.<eos> I ain't judging' her.<eos> I just think what she's doin' is totally wrong.<eos> Let me rephrase.<eos> Heather could use your support.<eos> Well, how am I supposed to support her if I don't agree with what she's doin'?<eos> You do it because you care.

The air is crisp.<eos> You're scared of my mom, aren't you?<eos> She's got a gun and she's not afraid of prison. I'm terrified.<eos> Look, I know that you and my mom talked... and I'm sorry... if you think I'm judging' you... 'cause I'm not.<eos> Really?<eos> So when you told me I'm taking the easy way out, that was you not judging me?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You see how easy it is?<eos> I mean, you're judging' me right now.<eos> And, by the way, I forgive you.
I don't think that's a good idea, Colt.<eos> It's already pretty emotional and...<eos> I need to go with someone who's dead inside, like my sister Darlene.<eos> I can be dead inside.<eos> I mean, I have been for 15 years, drivin' past the water tower.<eos> Look, to be honest, Colt... I don't wanna sit in a car with someone for 30 minutes who doesn't believe in what I'm doing.<eos> Uh, what I believe doesn't matter right now.<eos> I mean, if we were havin' this baby, I would drive you to the hospital and I'd be there for the entire thing.<eos> This is my responsibility, too.<eos> I'm just asking you to let me support you.
- Yeah.<eos> That's what his mom said when she answered the phone.<eos> - Want a beer? - Yeah, sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What you doin' out here?<eos> It's freezin'.<eos> Well, from this spot, I just barely connect to the house Wi-Fi.<eos> Don't tell Dad.<eos> Out here, my fridge and my bathroom are in the same spot, so that's cool.<eos> So... what's up with you?
Don't tell Dad.<eos> Out here, my fridge and my bathroom are in the same spot, so that's cool.<eos> So... what's up with you?<eos> Taking Heather to the clinic tomorrow.<eos> Damn.<eos> You wanna talk about it?<eos> Nope.<eos> That's why I come out here.<eos> To hang out and get drunk with you.<eos> Well, can't get drunk with you, but I can maintain drunk with you.
I ain't got time for this shit.<eos> Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?<eos> Hi, I have an appointment.<eos> Heather Roth.<eos> Okay, just fill out these forms, and we'll call you.<eos> - Thank you. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Uh, are these condoms free?<eos> It's a little late now, isn't it?<eos> You doin' okay?<eos> Oh, hey, I, uh... I brought you somethin'.
You doin' okay?<eos> Oh, hey, I, uh... I brought you somethin'.<eos> Whoa! Shit.<eos> It's, uh... my, uh, Saint Christopher's medal.<eos> It's supposed to protect you.<eos> I know it's silly, but when I was playin' football, I had, like, four surgeries on my knee.<eos> I wore it every time, came out fine.<eos> Maybe you should have worn it while you were playin'.<eos> Maybe I should have wore it when we were fuckin'.<eos> It's real sweet of you.
Thank you so much, Mr. Bennett.<eos> I know this isn't easy for you.<eos> But you're gonna be the mother of my grandchild and that makes you a Bennett, too.<eos> There's ever anything you need, you just let me know.<eos> You'll always have a seat at our table.<eos> Oh, my God, this is like Geico times ten.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - All right.<eos> Okay. That's...<eos> Hank, there's something I wanna tell you.
What is it with this town and yarn?<eos> By the way, thank you for the pot holders.<eos> I'm sorry, you know, about the only way you're gonna make more is if you burn the place down for the insurance money.<eos> But that's not legal advice.<eos> And it certainly has nothing to do with... you know, my completely accidental boat fire.<eos> Hey, Heather.<eos> Hey, Mr. Bennett.<eos> I brought you a little gift.<eos> Oh! I've been thinking about apple pie since this morning.<eos> Almost built you a crib so I could have an excuse to go back.
You don't like me.<eos> You've never liked me.<eos> I'm just some dumb student that you taught in high school, and if Colt didn't exist, you would've already forgot about me.<eos> Okay, Heather, I like you, okay?<eos> And the word's "forgotten," not "forgot," but I correct everyone.<eos> - Point is, I like you.<eos> - All right... She likes you, you like her.<eos> I like you both, and we all like pie.<eos> But really?<eos> 'Cause ever since Colt and I hooked up, all you've ever done is make bitchy little comments about my age or my intelligence. Okay.
He raised Rooster.<eos> Remind me to tell that to Rooster later.<eos> Colt, it's not funny, okay?<eos> She told me I was stuck up and that I need to get over myself.<eos> Look, Heather's going through a tough time.<eos> You've gotta give her a break.<eos> Are you taking her side?<eos> No. No, I... I'm not taking anyone's side.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause I just told you that she insulted me and you seem to care more about how she's doing.
I nearly pissed it away.<eos> Without you and Abby and all your help, you know... tagging the cows and helping me turn this around... never would have happened.<eos> So... thank you. You're a good brother.<eos> All right, enough with the sappy shit.<eos> What if this carcass is just a trap?<eos> What if this mountain lion is just luring us out here to eat us?<eos> What?<eos> Why would you put that in my head?<eos> I'm just saying, man, you gotta be ready for anything.<eos> For example, this thing goes sideways, I'm shooting you in the leg, sacrificing you to the cat and I'm home free.
There was even a baby born in the ladies' room.<eos> Yeah, and a guy died in the kitchen.<eos> See?<eos> It's not a bar.<eos> It's the circle of fucking life.<eos> Thanks, Beau.<eos> So... what are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know. Jerry says we probably won't get another offer.<eos> I've always trusted my gut.<eos> What's yours telling you?
Holy shit!<eos> I ain't never seen that before.<eos> I normally get extra cheese. It's better that way.<eos> Colt fucked up.<eos> It's still pretty good.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Truth is... I'm jealous.<eos> You know, I... thought I'd be the one starting a family with Colt.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I didn't mean to take that from you.
- We gotta talk.<eos> - Killed a mountain lion, too. Look, Rooster...<eos> I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but you're fired.<eos> What?<eos> Did you get in a bar fight on Friday?<eos> No, I won a bar fight on Friday.<eos> Did Umberto get deported as a result of that bar fight?<eos> Well, shit.<eos> I see where this is headed.<eos> I already told you where it's headed. You're fired.
You also drove the company truck after you'd been drinking, to a bar, where you got arrested.<eos> You also replied to my corporate e-mails with the word "unsubscribe."<eos> You are a good rancher, Rooster, but you are a terrible employee.<eos> You have no idea what you're doing.<eos> You still think it's me.<eos> I work for people. You work for people.<eos> If you understood that, you would still have a job.<eos> I'm gonna need any keys you have to the ranch and to your truck.<eos> I'm gonna need that phone, too.<eos> Well, I can't give you that right now.
You can go fishing another time.<eos> No, I mean, it's not about the fishing.<eos> It's just, like, Sunday, 9:00 a.m.<eos> I mean, that's just an arbitrary time and date, am I right?<eos> Yeah. I thought the same thing when they told me.<eos> Difference is, I thought it.<eos> I didn't say it.<eos> What I said was, was, "Great, we will get it done."<eos> Guess what I want you to say to me right now.<eos> Guess what I want to say to you right now.
No, mine's on silent. And it's in the fuckin' lake!<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, hey, Rich, what's up?<eos> Oh, yeah, just tagging the herd right now.<eos> And... cow number 47.<eos> Oh, you're at the ranch, huh?<eos> You don't see me?<eos> Well, I'm wavin'.<eos> No, I get it, yeah, I'll get to it on Monday.<eos> Well, that's when I'm gonna do it, so if you don't like that, too bad.
- It's okay, Beau.<eos> You were together a long time.<eos> It's been years since Jim passed and he's still on my mind.<eos> Just the other day, I was cleanin' out the garage, and... I found an old T-shirt of his that he'd worn on our honeymoon.<eos> And I smelled it just to bring him back, I guess.<eos> Forgot that we'd turned it into an old turpentine rag.<eos> Almost passed out.<eos> I love the smell of turpentine.<eos> If you are not ready to do this, it's okay.<eos> It's not that I don't enjoy being with you.

See?<eos> Told you he'd be here.<eos> Only bar within 50 miles.<eos> Yeah, well, I've never said this before, but you are a smart man, Colt.<eos> 'Sup, dipshit?<eos> Shouldn't you be back on the ranch tagging some cows?<eos> Yeah, I care about you too much to leave you here.<eos> Also, I don't have a ride back to the ranch.<eos> Well, I ain't goin' back to a place that don't appreciate me.<eos> Yeah, they're doing nothin' to show you they appreciate ya.
Been paying' my dues for 15 years.<eos> I deserve some respect, all right?<eos> I'm a great fuckin' rancher.<eos> You're extremely full of yourself.<eos> Is this, like, a family thing?<eos> Because you thought you were very good at football.<eos> I was good at football.<eos> Rooster, how many career touchdowns did I have?<eos> How the fuck should I know?<eos> If Neumann's Hill didn't trust you, they wouldn't have put you in charge.
40 years, Mags.<eos> How am I supposed to be with anybody else?<eos> Beau, you gotta stop looking back at the last 40, and start looking ahead at the next 20.<eos> Oh, good God, I can't do this for another 20 years.<eos> You're just better at this stuff than I am, Maggie.<eos> No, I am not.<eos> I have no idea what I'm doing.<eos> I'm just trying my best.<eos> In six months, it'll be easier than it is today.<eos> And six months after that, who knows, maybe I'll be introducing you to my new boyfriend.
Gallo, we live in fear every day.<eos> You know, five miles over the speed limit, and it could ruin our life.<eos> Why would I wanna put that on you, too?<eos> 'Cause we're your friends.<eos> Yeah. Plus this whole time I just thought you drove like a pussy.<eos> I'm sorry, Berto.<eos> It's out of my hands.<eos> No.<eos> No, this is... this is bullshit.<eos> You wanna take someone, you should take them assholes from down at the bar.
What are you talking about?<eos> Oh, it's a drinking game for when white trash couples fight in public.<eos> One drink if she cusses, two if she slaps him.<eos> And you gotta chug your whole beer if she throws a drink in his face.<eos> I'm so glad you guys are finding new and creative ways to drink.<eos> We're innovators, Ma.<eos> All right, I gotta go.<eos> What? We're just getting ready to do something real stupid.<eos> Sorry, dude, booty call.<eos> I'll tell Abby you say "what up?"
I'll tell Abby you say "what up?"<eos> I'm done with this!<eos> And you.<eos> Oh, shit, she gonna throw the drink.<eos> No, Hank, the game is you only chug if she throws a drink in his face.<eos> What game?<eos> Hey, Ed.<eos> - Hey, Rooster.<eos> I was hoping we could meet inside so I could grab a beer.<eos> - Way ahead of you, amigo.
Look, I appreciate you meeting me.<eos> - I assume you heard I got fired, yeah?<eos> Look, Ed... I need your help, all right?<eos> Any way you can call Neumann's Hill and try and get me my job back?<eos> Look, man, I'll do anything, okay?<eos> I'll even go to that meeting, you know, with the... with the...<eos> The one led by the hot chick with the... with the big rack.<eos> The sexual harassment seminar?<eos> Yeah, man, that one!<eos> Rooster, I'd love to help you, but I can't.
Don't matter.<eos> I'll find something better.<eos> No, I know you will.<eos> You wanna talk about it?<eos> Not much to talk about.<eos> Did I mention I got fired?<eos> There you go, you're up to date.<eos> Have you told your family?<eos> I just said I didn't want to talk about it.<eos> Honey, I'm just trying to help you.
Maybe that huge wad of tobacco in your mouth that makes you spit every ten seconds got in the way.<eos> You really need to spit, don't you?<eos> You somehow made it more disgusting.<eos> Well, at least I ain't gotta breathe it in.<eos> Stop it!<eos> I'm blowin' it out the window!<eos> Roll your window up, Colt!<eos> - Put out your cigarette out. - My God.<eos> You're making me miserable on my birthday.<eos> No, you're making you miserable on your birthday.

I'm sorry.<eos> Nah, it's all right.<eos> Fries aren't bad.<eos> No, it's nine o'clock.<eos> We should be sitting front row at Garth Brooks right now, listening to him sing "The Storm."<eos> Front row?<eos> I saw the tickets, Colt.<eos> Front row of the balcony.<eos> That's even better.<eos> You gotta puke, it's only a problem for the rich guy sittin' below you.
Remember how easy it used to be?<eos> We'd just, like, ditch school and go tubing'.<eos> Or ditch school and go fishing.<eos> Or ditch school and go...<eos> - How'd I graduate?<eos> - I did all your homework.<eos> We were 17. It's different now.<eos> We're older. We have responsibilities.<eos> That doesn't mean we still can't have fun.<eos> That's another thing I love about you, you're the most fun person I have ever met.
You used to date her.<eos> Not Heather. The guy.<eos> What is she, on a date?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What's a pregnant lady doing on a date?<eos> Oh, I know the answer to this one.<eos> "I don't give a fuck."<eos> I'm just saying, it's weird.<eos> No, what's weird is, later on tonight, that dude's dong is gonna be banging into your baby's head.<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?
No.<eos> Like we said...<eos> "Never be part of the other person's intervention."<eos> All right, cool.<eos> Hey, guys. Thanks for coming. Something I need to talk to you about...<eos> Mom, I'll take it from here.<eos> Rooster, your drinking has affected me and...<eos> That talk is coming, but not today.<eos> Look, when you guys were little, if I bought one of you a toy, I had to get the other one a toy.<eos> So, with that in mind, Colt, I got you this.
Wait, what?<eos> What... what are you talkin' about?<eos> Look, it's a simple proposal.<eos> You run the place and we split the profits.<eos> That way, you have a steady job and I can, you know, finally get out of here and travel.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> First, you give Rooster the huntin' cabin and now you're givin' him a job where he works at a bar and he gets to drink all day?<eos> I have a job where I work with Dad and I have to drink all day!<eos> Look, Colt, I'd do the same for you, but you don't need a job or a place to live.<eos> Somehow you ended up the son who's doing well.

- Yeah.<eos> I'm startin' to like this. - Yeah.<eos> I run the ranch, you run the bar...<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Let me try somethin'.<eos> "Rooster, give me a free whiskey." Oh, yeah, I like...<eos> That's right.<eos> Actually, I got a new rule.<eos> Colt, from now on, you pay for all your own drinks.<eos> I know this is a really big deal, so you just take your time and think about it.
You think your mom might be givin' you an intervention. Instead, she gives you a bar.<eos> Actually, now that I think of it, and you guys are together, - maybe we should talk about... - I gotta go.<eos> You boys and your drinking and...<eos> So, I'm glad you called.<eos> I didn't know we were meeting' someplace so fancy.<eos> I know you're jokin'.<eos> But the split pea soup comes with a piece of ham on top.<eos> How are you doin'?<eos> - I'm pretty good.<eos> How are you?
Oh, well, since I hold all the most important records, they let me work out here sometimes.<eos> And my, uh... my girlfriend, she works here.<eos> Abby Phillips.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> No, I know Abby.<eos> She's... she's awesome.<eos> Goes crazy for those jelly donuts, huh?<eos> - Well, I'm... I'm Paul Cutler.<eos> - Oh. Wrestling coach and math teacher.<eos> So, I can teach you how to do a half nelson or solve for x.
What am I supposed to do?<eos> Introduce him to my ex-boyfriend?<eos> I already had to start with "I'm pregnant."<eos> I'm just being protective of my kid.<eos> Oh, so, what? Now I just don't know how to judge someone's character or make good decisions?<eos> Well, uh, father of the baby.<eos> Maybe I'm the one who can't judge character. Whoa!<eos> I thought you were stayin' out of this. I'm trying.<eos> It's very hard.<eos> Hey, Colt, do you believe I care just as much about this kid as you do?
You know, Dale will keep using you, you can work around here whenever you need to.<eos> I mean, we don't have any sick cows, but Hank did get his arm stuck in the hand dryer last week.<eos> Well, I mean, how are you gonna leave if I don't take over the bar?<eos> Look, if you were running this place, and you got an offer for a ranching job, would you take it?<eos> - And would you want to take it?<eos> - I... I don't know.<eos> - Rooster.<eos> - I mean, yeah, probably.<eos> - That's just it.<eos> I never wanna get in the way of you and what makes you happy.
- You've gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me.<eos> Believe it or not, I've gotten worse welcomes.<eos> Here's everything I took, plus interest.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Bye.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was out of options.<eos> I just needed to get to my next gig, then I knew I could pay you back.<eos> I had a really good time with you that night.
I'll go put this in some water.<eos> Ready to go?<eos> About tonight, uh, might have to change our plans a little.<eos> Well, I'm flexible.<eos> We don't have to eat at the Golden Corral.<eos> We can get Golden Corral to go.<eos> Actually, uh, my granddaughter's here.<eos> Her mom was supposed to pick her up an hour ago.<eos> I haven't heard from her yet.<eos> Oh, and I tried to call you before you got all the way out here.
Nicole, can you turn on Beau's ringer for him?<eos> I've been fiddling with that thing for weeks.<eos> Can't imagine she's gonna fix it.<eos> Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.<eos> Yep, that's my ringtone.<eos> Thanks, folks.<eos> I'll be back in a bit.<eos> Uh, and remember, the more you drink, the better I sound.<eos> Hey.<eos> I didn't think you were comin'.

Yeah, that's pretty good.<eos> You'd make a good little rancher.<eos> But you don't want your pig to graze next to your horse and your cows.<eos> That's a recipe for amoebic giardia.<eos> But Piggy and Horsey are friends.<eos> Well, if you don't fix that fence up, Piggy and Horsey are gonna get slaughtered by Wolfy and Coyote.<eos> Hey, sweetie, that was your mommy.<eos> Guess what? She says you can sleep over tonight.<eos> Yay!<eos> Wish I'd known that before I gave you all that candy.

I'm just saying, you know?<eos> Here, I'm not a bartender,<eos> I'm not someone's mother, I'm not someone's ex-wife.<eos> I'm just me.<eos> Cindy from Tulsa.<eos> You got a whole backstory, huh?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I'm wanted by the FBI.<eos> No big deal.<eos> Just, seriously, thank you, thank you, thank you for asking me.
Trying to figure out the rest of my life.<eos> You wanna talk about anything?<eos> I got up, I got dressed, I was gonna steal your wallet and sneak out.<eos> There's no money in my wallet.<eos> Trust me, I know.<eos> I was about to leave... but that would mean heading back to the same old thing I've been doing for the last 40 years.<eos> Same people.<eos> Same conversations.<eos> Same ol' Maggie.<eos> Do you have any idea how much fun I had last night?
Freedom like that's the best thing in the world.<eos> Except for cocaine.<eos> Fuck, I miss getting high.<eos> Where are you headed next?<eos> Well, after what I just said, I should probably hit a meeting up somewhere around here.<eos> Then I got a gig in Albuquerque in a few days. I'm playing the Bernalillo Winter Harvest.<eos> I go on right after they crown the Bernalillo Armadillo Princess.<eos> You want a ride?<eos> You wanna go on the road with me?<eos> Well, I wanna go to Albuquerque with you.
But check this out.<eos> I got this at last year's concert.<eos> The Froot Loops bird!<eos> Yeah, it's a parrot.<eos> Uh-uh-uh-uh. It's a toucan.<eos> Smarter than a lawyer.<eos> Yeah, well, have a good night.<eos> - Goodbye, Jerry.<eos> - Bye.<eos> What's up with you?
Shit.<eos> You want me to kick his ass?<eos> Whose?<eos> Yeah, I don't know. That's just my go-to move when something goes wrong.<eos> Guess, uh...<eos> Guess, in the end, it's probably a good thing, huh?<eos> Good thing?<eos> Yeah. Like you said, now you're gonna be around.<eos> Seriously?<eos> So, I just tell you that all my plans for the future fell apart, and all you have to say is, "It's a good thing"?
Man, oh, man.<eos> Things get any tougher for Mom, you know?<eos> She can't sell her bar and now her son is stocking shelves at the Safeway.<eos> You know, the hair straighteners are on aisle eight if you're sick of looking like a fucking poodle.<eos> That was a good one.<eos> You scared the shit out of me!<eos> What the hell are you doing on the couch?<eos> I was trying to stay up until you got home.<eos> Aw, that's sweet.<eos> I even cooked you a lasagna, but I fell asleep and it burned.
I just...<eos> She asked... And then she said we're supposed to find out whether or not it's a boy or girl.<eos> You know, hopefully it's a boy.<eos> But either way, you know, boy.<eos> Well, of course you should go.<eos> - It's just... - Are you mad?<eos> No, I'm... - disappointed.<eos> - Aw, that's even worse!<eos> It's fine, okay.<eos> I wanted to hang out with you, that's all.
There's more to the world than this town.<eos> God.<eos> Once in your fucking life, why can't you just be supportive?<eos> Because I don't want you to leave.<eos> Okay, well, when's it gonna matter what I want?<eos> I don't know what life looks like without you.<eos> I mean, we get separated.<eos> And now divorced.<eos> But you were always close by.<eos> You're the one I'd come talk to when times got tough.
It's not up to us.<eos> Yeah, hit him, Mom.<eos> He deserves it.<eos> I know this isn't what you want. No, it's not.<eos> Right now is not a good time for you to go.<eos> Well... But that's just the thing, Colt, there'll always be a reason not to go.<eos> A baby, a wedding,<eos> Rooster screwing up at the bar.<eos> But all those things will also be reasons to come back.<eos> Look, you don't have to like it.
Mother of... us.<eos> Mom!<eos> What is she doing here?<eos> She's not even related to these people!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You, me, Mom, Dad, alone.<eos> Without Gloria to absorb the hate.<eos> Okay, why am I scared?<eos> I'm feeling scared.<eos> Because you are flashing back to every family event that ended with Dad whisper-screaming at Mom,
No! You know what, I would have cussed her out last night, except the selfish hag left the moment her daughter's dance was over.<eos> I hope there's no rule in here about causing a commotion.<eos> I mean, we didn't really feel the need to put it up on a sign because, you know, civilization.<eos> Well, I answer to a higher law. Hey!<eos> Get back here!<eos> You don't even know it's her.<eos> You're basing this off of the back of the head of someone you saw in the dark.<eos> That may be how you recognize your old boyfriends, but...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> As much as I admire that and do intend on using it on Mitchell without giving you any credit, there is a line.
I'll just take the tray.<eos> Admission has gotten tougher.<eos> Only about 4 out of 10 applicants get accepted.<eos> You've beaten worse odds than that.<eos> We forgot to get you vaccinated till you were 6.<eos> The university boasts many noted graduates... research scientists, journalists, and one pretty well-known playwright.<eos> Wow. "Pretty well-known?"<eos> Imagine how many cookies they could have sold if they called them "Pretty Well-Known Amos's."<eos> Oh! I tied your shoelaces together.<eos> Mom, what's going on with you?
Not really.<eos> You talk like this a lot.<eos> The point is, Gretchen got a full ride treading bells like these.<eos> Wow, that's high.<eos> Maybe you could, too.<eos> Get you into a class on...<eos> What? I'm gonna learn all this in three months?<eos> You're a quick study!<eos> Look at how fast you learned magic.<eos> I got a home movie of you pulling an impossibly long chain of baby wipes out of your diaper.
I believe you can do anything you put your mind to.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh! Shoot!<eos> I guess it's all computerized now.<eos> Who cares?<eos> God, I hate it when you do this.<eos> Do what?<eos> You look mad.<eos> Are you mad?<eos> ... And I keep telling you, but it's like you're not hearing me!
I'm not Richard, you fool.<eos> I'm the father you and your giant iPad robbed of his daughter's first ballet solo.<eos> I hope whatever reason you had to prioritize your child over mine was a good one, and now that I hear it, it's pretty close, I have to admit, but still.<eos> Wow!<eos> You're a maniac, but I'm grateful because this has been one of the most abysmal dates - I have ever been on. - Oh!<eos> People think that cats are standoffish, but my guy, when I come home...<eos> Okay, I've got to stop you right there.<eos> I'm not Ana, and this isn't happening.<eos> I had a feeling.<eos> Can I at least take a picture with you so I can tell other women we dated?
All right, get in here.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Manny, come on.<eos> We're going to be late for the mixer.<eos> Uh, excuse me, did I say your time-out was over?<eos> Back on the bed.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> No more pranks.<eos> I promise.<eos> I just wanted to have fun with you.
Oh, you remembered, Sarge.<eos> That was the only drink I could keep down when I was pregnant.<eos> Who are those people?<eos> You heard them.<eos> They're "Sarge" and "Pea."<eos> Two nicknames I have never heard in my entire life.<eos> This kindness, I don't trust it.<eos> I know, it's like a purple sky before a storm.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Beautiful until you realize the birds are agitated and ants are walking in circles.
I know.<eos> It almost never works.<eos> All right, you old bags, put your teeth in, you're taking me out.<eos> Sal, what are you doing here?<eos> It's Valentine's Day and my new German boyfriend, Werner, is out of town, and I don't like to drink alone.<eos> [Laughter] The first part's true.<eos> Well, actually, we have plans.<eos> Aw, but now you have better plans.<eos> Fausta here can babysit Sammy and General Tsour over there.<eos> Sammy, tell your guncles hello like I taught you.
I come from a very long line of overly sexy men.<eos> My cousin Ricardo, he had a sex addition.<eos> You mean "addiction."<eos> Uh, yeah, sorry.<eos> He built an addiction onto his house for making love to his many girlfriends.<eos> Well, Joe just needs to know that this type of gift is not okay.<eos> And you're right, and I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Did I do something wrong?<eos> You did take something out of your mom's drawer without asking.<eos> But I'm gonna give you a pass on that one.
- It's Clive, actually.<eos> Apparently they have a thing like how you and your sister go to those conventions dressed like stuffed animals. Oh.<eos> Uh, Claire, your 2:00 is here and you can't be late.<eos> Phil, look, I really appreciate this.<eos> I do.<eos> - It's just that... - So, I spoke to the florist.<eos> Turns out my admirer sent these from Pritchett's Closets.<eos> I may have a sad love life, but I don't need my mommy trying to boost my self-esteem.<eos> And if you really want to give me some confidence, how about a picture of me on your desk, and not just Haley and Luke.<eos> First of all, I didn't give you those flowers.

Did you see the uggs? Okay.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Mom, I'm home.<eos> We got valentines.<eos> Oh, hi, Mrs. Kewley.<eos> Is the party over?<eos> We had an incident.<eos> Your son gave my Bailey a very strange Valentine's gift.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Didn't your father talk to you about this already?
Yeah, and he said it's okay to give it to a girlfriend.<eos> We're going.<eos> And Bailey is certainly not his girlfriend.<eos> She would be lucky!<eos> Is that Bailey?<eos> 'Cause I think Joe has a little thing for her.<eos> Yeah, he did have a little thing for her.<eos> It's here.<eos> He did it again.<eos> I knew I shouldn't have trusted you talking to him, because you will let him get away with murder because he's a mini you and you like it.
- Cameron: Oh, gosh.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> Need a sailor to cross off number four on that Valentine's Day list of yours?<eos> Was that mean?<eos> I've been around Sal, I've lost my filter.<eos> You know what?<eos> We all make mistakes.<eos> Which is a-a funny thing to remember when we tell you about a very funny misunderstanding.

I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> We had a whole incident... mwah... at the warehouse, a paint mixer blew up.<eos> Luckily I had these overalls in my office I could...<eos> Oh, you're mad, aren't you?<eos> Mad? [Chuckles]<eos> I mean, was this the best Valentine's Day we've ever had?<eos> No.<eos> Was it the worst?<eos> Yes.<eos> I gave you a great gift.
I would like to serve him.<eos> You cannot!<eos> Now shut your mouth, before I fill it, with my boot!<eos> When do you plan to begin?<eos> When I am drunk.<eos> Have you done this before?<eos> Never, but I know it's best to wait, for the blood to thicken.<eos> I would like to have some of their mail, or leather.<eos> I will earn it... by taking the first head.<eos> You can take what you want. I need to become accustomed... to how it feels.
We'll be using an axe.<eos> Lords and Earls of Cumberland, I thank you for showing this great unity.<eos> Cumberland has, over the years, become a land for both Dane and Saxon.<eos> Together, with the power of the Christian God, we can achieve great things.<eos> Amen. Amen.<eos> As your king, I have decided... that it's time for our army to march!<eos> To Eoferwic!<eos> Lord, I am Ulf.<eos> Ulf?<eos> My father spoke very well of you.
I would like you to make a journey, to Bebbanburg... to Lord Aelfric.<eos> Is Aelfric not our enemy? Hmm.<eos> He is our enemy solely because he is Uhtred's enemy and yet he is a Christian.<eos> Can we say the same of the long-haired peacock?<eos> To face the Northmen, to face Kjartan the Dane, we will need men, God-fearing men.<eos> Lord Aelfric could well provide those men.<eos> I have offered him a bargain, in this letter.<eos> You will bring me an answer.<eos> I will, Lord.<eos> May God be with you.
But it can be done?<eos> There are other ways.<eos> It can be done, yes.<eos> Then that is what we do.<eos> Lord, this is not a plan that can be decided upon quickly.<eos> There are other ways!<eos> Uhtred, as the king explained earlier, you do not have a voice...<eos> I will say what's on my mind and clearly!<eos> This plan can never work... there are other ways to defeat Kjartan.<eos> It seems everyone is wrong but you, Uhtred Ragnarson.
Bishop: God help us!<eos> I don't think he can.<eos> Ragnar!<eos> This is where our father was killed.<eos> *VIKINGS* Season 04 Episode 19 "On the Eve" Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala<eos> Yeah, we need those reinforced!<eos> Bring some more!<eos> The stake needs retying!<eos> Every other man on the outer perimeter! Man:<eos> Look at the towers. You'll see.
And may you rest in peace.<eos> Ecbert: Give the Bishop a proper and decent Christian burial.<eos> Even in such times, we must do what is right.<eos> So, King Aelle is defeated.<eos> Most horribly and barbarously put to death, sire.<eos> So it is said.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to hear it.<eos> For all our sakes.<eos> That Great Army is doubtless on its way here already.<eos> I charge you, my son, to go out and face it.
Sleep peacefully.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Good boy.<eos> I hope to god you're right, my son.<eos> For right now, all the dreams and plans I had stand in the greatest jeopardy.<eos> You're not the only one who had dreams, father.<eos> If you'll forgive me, I have messengers to dispatch.<eos> I urge you again to go back to him, my love.<eos> He will need the strength and brilliance of your mind.<eos> You must forgive him, as he must forgive you.

I see their spineless God running away from our Gods.<eos> For once, why don't you just listen to an older, wiser brother?<eos> These people who are running away, they're not warriors.<eos> They are not the ones who will stay and fight to defend this kingdom.<eos> And protect their honor.<eos> For what is a warrior without his honor?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You tell me, brother.<eos> And, tell me again, how many battles have you fought?<eos> Same as you, brother, except I don't ride around in a comfortable bloody chariot!
Floki, find her, please.<eos> Tanaruz?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You hate us.<eos> I...<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Helga: Tanaruz.<eos> My baby!<eos> My baby!<eos> You're okay, aren't you?
How could she marry that nobody?<eos> Maybe she loves him. And, if she loves him, then he is somebody.<eos> How are you suddenly so wise, brother?<eos> It may have escaped your attention but I am not married myself.<eos> You know why?<eos> I don't understand women any more than you do.<eos> Women are fickle.<eos> Forget her.<eos> Ellisif?<eos> I came to forgive you.
It is not your fault you could not wait for me.<eos> You probably thought it was an impossible task you had set me, in any case.<eos> I was never supposed to achieve it.<eos> You never really intended to marry me, did you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't even know your name.<eos> My name is Vik, King Harald.<eos> I am happy to meet you.<eos> Believe me, I knew nothing of this...<eos> Arrangement you had with my wife.
But I'm glad that you have forgiven her.<eos> Ellisif: No!<eos> Vik!<eos> Vik.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> They say you are called Egil!<eos> Egil the bastard.<eos> That's what they call you.<eos> But you are neither Earl nor King.<eos> How could you could collect such an army?
Vik.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> They say you are called Egil!<eos> Egil the bastard.<eos> That's what they call you.<eos> But you are neither Earl nor King.<eos> How could you could collect such an army?<eos> Who paid for your Army,<eos> Egil the bastard?<eos> Why should I tell you?

Perhaps, instead of a narrow and small place, we should stretch the battlefield across a large area, many miles.<eos> And use the landscape.<eos> Ditches, hills, woods.<eos> What do you say?<eos> If it works, it is a good plan.<eos> If it doesn't, then it is a bad plan.<eos> Man 1: Tie the horses together!<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Ha!<eos> Can I talk to you?
I never loved him.<eos> I loved you.<eos> But people persuaded me.<eos> They lied to me.<eos> Can you understand?<eos> Your dream seemed a long time away.<eos> But I was wrong, so wrong, I should have waited!<eos> And now I see why.<eos> You are going to do exactly what you said you would do.<eos> And I should have believed you.
I'm just gonna go let the Wockeez know our idea.<eos> Hey, Dev.<eos> Hey, what's up, Lisa?<eos> Just coming in for a quick touch-up. Sure.<eos> So you're Indian, right? Yes.<eos> Well, I'm friends with this Indian guy I think you might know.<eos> Come on, you're not gonna do that shit, are you, Lisa?<eos> You don't go up to white people and go, "Hey, you're white, right?<eos> I know this white person. You might know 'em?"<eos> Well, he said he went to college with you.
- No can do, bud.<eos> We're heading up to Queens to the Kids Foot Locker. The Wockeez are doing a little in-store blessing.<eos> We got to get those primo seats.<eos> Arnie, you're gonna block all these kids' views.<eos> First come, first served.<eos> Hi.<eos> - It's so good to see you! I can't believe you're here!<eos> Neither can I.<eos> You're still Italian. Yes.<eos> How are you?
Your first visit? What do you think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's so much stuff here. Yeah.<eos> You should put that on a shirt.<eos> New York City: There's so much stuff here.<eos> Well, no, I mean it.<eos> I mean, I've been walking all day through the city just staring at the building like this.<eos> - I love it. - Ah.<eos> Well, that is adorable.<eos> I gotta tell you something, though. I am very hungry.
Please? Please welcome, all the way from Cleveland,<eos> Karen from Karen's Confections!<eos> That was awful.<eos> Ah. So this is the piece that I really wanted to see.<eos> It's called The Dinner Party.<eos> Cool.<eos> Is it me or do all these look like vaginas?<eos> Yeah, it's kind of like saying that all these women across history have been discriminated against just because they have vaginas.<eos> Whoa. Did this lady have a piano vagina?<eos> I'm never going to a museum with you again.
Uh, the little birdie was telling the truth. I lived in Modena for a few months, learned how to make pasta.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> Modena? Home of tortellini in brodo.<eos> We went there a couple years ago with Jeff's Table.<eos> Best episode ever. - You see that one?<eos> - Yeah, it was great.<eos> You remember that fuckin' scene... Remember that scene where I'm sitting there with the old guy in the cafe with the hat?<eos> I actually didn't see it. You just seemed so fired up, I wanted to tell you I saw it.<eos> I love it.<eos> I'll send you a link. - All right.
Speaking of which, I got dinner number four. I'm meeting some people from my new charity, Jeff's Kids.<eos> Love those kids.<eos> Don't have a heart attack.<eos> Timmy, can we get a check?<eos> Oh, Chef, the meal's compliments of the house.<eos> God damn it, you son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!<eos> They do this all the time.<eos> All right, tell him thanks.<eos> Oh, shit. I almost forgot.<eos> Bottle of champagne there, I brought that for you.
So how was your day?<eos> It was good.<eos> Um, we did a taping of Clash of the Cupcakes.<eos> Uh, you know we had that dance crew the Jabbawockeez on earlier this week?<eos> Who is that?<eos> They're like these guys.<eos> They, like, dance and have masks.<eos> They were really good.<eos> Cool.<eos> Um, how about you?
You can have a bite.<eos> Doing anything fun for the weekend?<eos> Um, yeah, I'm going to a Rangers game.<eos> Are you into hockey?<eos> I know of hockey.<eos> Um, I've never been to a game, though, or watched one on TV.<eos> - But I've heard it's fun.<eos> - It's fun. Yeah.<eos> I grew up watching a bunch of sports with my dad.<eos> What about you?
New York's number one desi-owned organic, non-GMO chickpea-based protein.<eos> Uh, Francesca. Italian person. No companies.<eos> Uh. Nice.<eos> She saw you do that.<eos> Huh. Why are you wearing a tuxedo?<eos> Why are you guys dressed so cas, man?<eos> I thought this was black tie.<eos> Is this not black tie?<eos> No.<eos> This is a dinner party. Why would you rent a tux?
No, it's not just that.<eos> Merde. I think it's finished.<eos> What's "merd-ah" mean?<eos> Um, it means "shit."<eos> It's an Italian expression.<eos> We use it to say, "Shit, it's finished."<eos> Mm.<eos> Can't believe you guys never taught me the bad words while I was living in Modena.<eos> You're right.<eos> I think I should teach you something.
It means "Go fuck yourself and all your dead family members."<eos> That's cold.<eos> When I'm mad, I just go, "Hey.<eos> Why you gotta be like that?"<eos> You're evil.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'm not evil.<eos> Am I evil?<eos> Hmm... No. I think you're sweet.<eos> I forgot how fun it was having you around.
She does makeup.<eos> She is fine, man.<eos> Is she single? - I don't know.<eos> - You need to ask her out.<eos> What the fuck you doing talking to me?<eos> She is cute. I don't know if that's in the cards, though.<eos> You're cray, okay?<eos> You need to get with that.<eos> Okay, so... we are getting close to the end of the season.<eos> So... wanted to check in with you. How you feeling?

All right, so...<eos> I wanted to talk to you about this Clash of the Cupcakes thing.<eos> I am so flattered.<eos> Um... I can't believe you guys would want to work with me for seven seasons, and it seems like a tremendous opportunity, but I...<eos> I don't think it's the right fit for me.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You don't want to do it?<eos> It's just that I'm not super passionate about the show.<eos> And if I'm doing it for seven seasons, that's a long time.<eos> And I... I don't think it'd be fair to you or to me if I... if I did something like that without my heart being fully invested in it, you know what I mean?
I would love to do that in India... or anywhere, you know?<eos> That's what I should do as a show.<eos> What if I did something like that?<eos> As a travel show?<eos> And it could be my version of Jeff's Table.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I would love that show.<eos> I'd love it, but it's a big investment, Dev.<eos> And you're a new face. I...<eos> I couldn't... I couldn't give you your own travel show right now.
Yes, I'm very pleased.<eos> But at the same time, it's quite a conundrum.<eos> I like both of these women, but I need to choose one.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I mean, it's kind of hard for me to answer that for you.<eos> I guess I would just ask myself, who do I feel more strongly about?<eos> Like, when I wake up in the morning, who do I want to spend the day with?<eos> Hmm. That's a nice way to solve the problem.<eos> I will break up with Linda. At once.<eos> So Linda, there's something I wanted to talk to you about.
I will break up with Linda. At once.<eos> So Linda, there's something I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> Sure, what is it?<eos> This smells really good.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's yukgaejang.<eos> It's beef stew with kimchi.<eos> I've been cooking this all day. You're gonna really like it.<eos> Mmm, these flavors, they're phenomenal.<eos> I still have many more dishes I'd like to cook for you.
Might help if I tasted the stew.<eos> Any leftovers?<eos> There were, but I woke up late at night, made a snack.<eos> The snack was the stew.<eos> Yeah. Got that.<eos> I must break up with Ellen.<eos> And then we found the spreadsheets were in the hot tub the whole time.<eos> I mean, it was the craziest audit I've ever done.<eos> That's an interesting story. Mm-hmm.<eos> - Ellen? - Hmm? There's something I need to talk to you about.
This guy, he comes into my office.<eos> He slams his balls on my table.<eos> Walks out, comes back a few days later, drops his pants, pisses genius all over my office.<eos> These metaphors are getting really disgusting.<eos> You, me, Best Food Friends.<eos> Let's do it!<eos> Ciao, Francesca, how are you?<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm really good.<eos> How are you?
Ciao, Francesca, how are you?<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm really good.<eos> How are you?<eos> I just got some crazy news.<eos> I'm gonna do this new TV show with Chef Jeff where it's just me and him traveling around, eating good food.<eos> I'm done with Clash of the Cupcakes.<eos> That sounds great.<eos> I'm so happy for you.<eos> How's everything with you?
I was trying to help.<eos> What y'all doing in here?<eos> Dev, now, what you know about brown sugar?<eos> You're 12 years old.<eos> You still got some of your baby teeth.<eos> Now, y'all ain't got no business listening to these songs.<eos> Look at Denise over there, staring at D'Angelo.<eos> Denise, put on your dress so you can look nice for dinner.<eos> Man, this is some bullshit.<eos> Denise, that does not look like the clothes I picked out for you.
Good to meet you, Michelle.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Get out of here.<eos> - They're nice. - Mm-hmm.<eos> They... they are.<eos> They're great.<eos> Um, Denise, maybe we can take Michelle to that Chinese restaurant in Flushing I was telling you about.<eos> Yeah, that sounds cool.<eos> Dev, why you plotting your next meal and you ain't finished the one in front of you?
All right, I was kidding earlier but the phrase "curry people"... definitely racist.<eos> I'm not racist.<eos> You can't say "curry person."<eos> I-I'm not a curry person. I'm not defined by the flavors my people enjoy.<eos> Okay, I didn't say...<eos> What do you call Chinese people? Soy sauce people?<eos> No.<eos> I don't call them like this. Oh.<eos> Well... even though you are a little racist... I'm glad you're here.<eos> It's fun hanging out with you again.
"Please come.<eos> I really want to see you."<eos> Then she threw in a couple more emojis.<eos> - What kind of emoji?<eos> - This guy. That's huggy, bro.<eos> Get that fucking huggy away from me.<eos> I want kissy, or I want red hearts only.<eos> Ah, come on, man.<eos> Let's just go. It'll be good to see what's up with them.<eos> All right, I'll go with you.

Oof, yeah.<eos> It's okay. Let's just stay in.<eos> Sure.<eos> Can I have the blanket?<eos> It's a bit cold.<eos> Of course.<eos> Thank y-o-o-ou.<eos> once you put this blanket on, you will leave New York City and enter...<eos> Cozyville?<eos> Mm-hmm. Do you like it here?
- Sure.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Uh, Robert Redford... when he was young.<eos> And... Marlon Brando.<eos> When he was alive, obviously.<eos> So two of yours, you'd have to use a time machine.<eos> That's not an ideal list.<eos> No.<eos> Actually, it's not.<eos> What about you?
Oh, my God, she slept over?<eos> Yes!<eos> In my bed! With me!<eos> It was intense.<eos> Wow. Forbidden love.<eos> Arnie's jealous.<eos> I mean, there was definitely moments where I was like, "What is going on here?<eos> Do I just make a move?"<eos> Bro, come on, what are you doing?<eos> She was in your bed with you.
That could be good.<eos> Or, I mean, maybe it's better to just have a private conversation in the apartment.<eos> I like that, too.<eos> But either way, you got to talk to her from your heart.<eos> I just... I really don't know how I'd say it.<eos> There's something going on.<eos> I can feel it inside. And I know you can, too.<eos> I know you're engaged, and everything's complicated, but I had to say something, 'cause if I didn't, I'd regret it for the rest of my life.<eos> Bro, that was very powerful.<eos> If I'm Francesca, I'm giving you kissies, 100%.

Bravo.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So... someone smaller... Mm-hmm. More charming and funny.<eos> Sound pretty great.<eos> It is.<eos> What if I told you I met someone like that... but they're engaged?<eos> Well, I would say, it's a tricky situation... but for both of them.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Um, I'm sorry about tonight.<eos> I need to talk to you.
He wants to meet with me.<eos> It's amazing! That's great.<eos> That's great, exactly...<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What do you mean, "nothing"?<eos> I tell you good news about the distributor in DC.<eos> You say "fantastic" with an attitude.<eos> What the hell's going on, huh?<eos> I've been feeling strange for a while... and you haven't noticed until now.
No!<eos> Tell me the truth, Francé.<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Wow, this is so cool.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Yeah, it's nice.<eos> Nice?<eos> I mean, it's amazing.<eos> Come on, what's going on with you?
What do you want me to say?<eos> I want you to say... that you feel the same way I feel inside and that I'm not crazy.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yes! I do!<eos> Okay?<eos> I do feel something for you.<eos> I do like you.<eos> I probably love you.<eos> I think of you.<eos> I dream of you.
We can figure this out.<eos> We can.<eos> Francesca, it's your life.<eos> You really want to be with Pino? Is that what you want in your heart?<eos> You can't be lukewarm.<eos> What's "lukewarm"?<eos> It means not hot, not cold. It's in the middle.<eos> I don't want to be lukewarm.<eos> No.<eos> See? I just want to do this with you.

Let me guess.<eos> You broke up with Pino. Everything's okay. And we can continue having a joyous time in New York together.<eos> Dev. I shouldn't even be here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> [Dev] [sighs] How are you feeling?<eos> I feel shit.<eos> I feel horrible. I feel I'm doing something terrible behind his back.<eos> He's a nice person.<eos> He doesn't deserve this.<eos> You know how bad it is just to spend time with you, enjoy the moment, and then go back home, lie in bed with your actual fiancé?
I'm glad I don't have to deal with it.<eos> You got these, right?<eos> Um, yeah.<eos> [Dev] Hey, Lisa.<eos> Hey, Dev.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What's up?<eos> We were just shooting nearby. I thought I'd come say hello.<eos> -Cool.<eos> How are you?
-Yeah.<eos> [man] Back in five, four, three, two... [upbeat theme music plays]<eos> Well, uh, we're back with-- with Chef Jeff.<eos> You know, my--my producer talked to me during the break, and he told me some very interesting breaking news that I would be remiss if I didn't bring up right now, Jeff.<eos> I don't know if you-- if you know this, but as of now on the Internet, there is about 14 females accusing you of sexually inappropriate conduct.<eos> -[crowd gasping] -What?<eos> [Raven] Oh, yes, Jeff, there are detailed accounts being posted right now of you having sexually inappropriate behavior with fellow staff members and guests of your show.<eos> Would you like to respond to these allegations?<eos> [Jeff] I don't--I don't really know what's going on right now.<eos> Okay, I mean, I came out here to share some delicious paella with you and your beautiful audience.
Everyone, Chef Jeff and his-- his little BFF, Dev Shah.<eos> I can't really condone watching their show at this point.<eos> That's okay, we'll be right back with a live performance from Dierks Bentley.<eos> [laughs] [women] ♪ This here is Raven Live! ♪ ♪ Yes it is Raven Live!<eos> ♪ ♪ Get on your feet ♪<eos> I'm serious.<eos> She's putting every--hey.<eos> Can you fucking believe this, man?<eos> I--I--I mean, it's fucked.<eos> I'm setting up a conference call with my PR team. We're gonna set up some talking points for you. Don't worry, this'll blow over.
It's just, um...<eos> It's just not easy.<eos> It's--[exhales]<eos> I don't even know how to start this kind of conversation, um...<eos> I have so many things in my head.<eos> I'm still trying to figure out what-- what I think, what I want, and...<eos> Like, a month ago I knew everything about me and I knew that I was going to marry Pino and we would have kids and we would probably made a happy family over-- other there in Italy, in Modena.<eos> And then I came here and-- and everything changed.<eos> I just don't know what I want anymore.<eos> [Dev sighs] I don't want to hurt you because I really, really care about you.
I just don't know what I want anymore.<eos> [Dev sighs] I don't want to hurt you because I really, really care about you.<eos> Stop.<eos> Don't even bother.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> I just feel used.<eos> I did not use you.<eos> That's what it feels like.<eos> [Francesca] Well, but I did not.<eos> Dev, I felt every single moment that I spent with you.
Hey.<eos> Dev, really. Let me go.<eos> Hey, Dev.<eos> Hey, Rachel.<eos> What's up?<eos> Um... How are you?<eos> How is everything?<eos> Um, things are good.<eos> They're, uh, really good.<eos> How are, uh, how are things with you?
Much obliged.<eos> I told you that brooch meant a great deal to me. - Confess at once. - But I didn't take it.<eos> Or I'll send you right back to the asylum.<eos> I took the brooch outside with me.<eos> I lost it. Tomorrow you will go.<eos> I can't trust one word out of your mouth.<eos> But I made that up! Please, Miss Cuthbert!<eos> Enough!<eos> Shut your face from now on!<eos> We're sick of you and your stupid stories.
Continue with the barn work.<eos> Stack some wood in the kitchen.<eos> I have to go!<eos> Marilla!<eos> Marilla!<eos> I have to go! Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait.<eos> Thomas rode out at first light.<eos> I came to tell you.
No, listen, dear.<eos> Thomas will ride all the way to the train station.<eos> He'll check the road as he goes. What if he's lying dead in a ditch?<eos> ! - Marilla...<eos> - What if they both are?<eos> Enough now!<eos> What if something horrible has happened and it's my fault...<eos> Stop it, Marilla.<eos> Boy!<eos> Thomas is miles ahead of you.
Isn't that wonderful?<eos> Yes, it is, but I've got several deliveries to make...<eos> My years of torment and uncertainty are behind me.<eos> And I'll have to learn all manner of comportment, but I feel equal to the task.<eos> Certainly sounds like you're moving up in the world. I am.<eos> I am indeed.<eos> So if you wouldn't mind conveying me towards my new life?<eos> It's not that I mind, but trouble is, I've got several stops along the way.<eos> It'll be a few hours, I'm afraid.<eos> If you're in a hurry, you might find a better mode.
What time does the ferry to Nova Scotia go?<eos> 'Round about 5:00.<eos> Local boy loses life by drowning!<eos> Out of the way, mister!<eos> And I believe my parents traveled to India and many faraway lands before they were killed tragically in service of the queen.<eos> You don't say.<eos> I imagine they were ever so noble.<eos> Easy. Easy.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Alright, off you go.
Thomas.<eos> Here we are, here we all are.<eos> Glad to see you, Matthew.<eos> Welcome home, Anne.<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Lynde.<eos> How do you do, Mr. Lynde?<eos> Glad we didn't find you in a ditch.<eos> Yes, yes, dear, everyone appreciates your gallantry.<eos> Well, we aim to please.<eos> Marilla, I hope you're feeling better now, dear.

May I call you Aunt Marilla?<eos> You may not.<eos> But I'd love to call you Aunt Marilla.<eos> It would make me seem as if I really belonged to you.<eos> Well, I'm not your aunt and I don't believe in calling people names that don't belong to them.<eos> - Well, we could imagine you're my aunt.<eos> - I couldn't.<eos> Do you never imagine things are different than they are?<eos> I do not.<eos> Oh, Marilla, how much you miss.

I believe it to be in fairly good working order. Hmm. And with any luck,<eos> I'll catch up with the rest of the class quite quickly.<eos> That's not really my concern.<eos> Do you want to know what my big concern is?<eos> My overriding concern?<eos> I'm sure you'll tell us soon enough.<eos> It's this awful red hair!<eos> This horrible, hideous, horrible red hair.<eos> It's the bane of my existence.<eos> Anne Shirley-Cuthbert, I suggest you find a worthier overriding concern.
Hello, Diana!<eos> My, what have you done to your hat?<eos> Well, I wanted to make a good first impression and it was so plain.<eos> You're making an impression all right.<eos> I'm glad you found your way.<eos> I expect we should be able to walk together soon.<eos> We can't?<eos> I'm sure it won't be long until my parents accept you, now that you're a Cuthbert and all.<eos> Welcome to the first day of school.<eos> Come on, I'll show you everything you need to know.
Roll over.<eos> Don't mind my brother.<eos> He's ridiculous!<eos> Never let the boys know when they've upset you.<eos> Never let them know when you like them, either.<eos> School... is a lot to contend with.<eos> Have you ever been to a real school, or did they just send you to special orphan school?<eos> Come on, Anne, let's finish the tour.<eos> Bring your milk.<eos> I'll show you the stream outside.
Over here. Ruff!<eos> Who's a good girl?<eos> What'd you bring, Anne?<eos> Josie Pye doesn't like me at all.<eos> I brought a lace-trimmed handkerchief in honour of the occasion.<eos> It should make a lovely presentation.<eos> Hopefully your apple's already sliced for sharing.<eos> Apple? I...<eos> I...<eos> Come on, I'll show you the rest.
At least we can agree on that.<eos> The two of you are an inspiration!<eos> To think that you've been friends since school.<eos> Kindred spirits forever!<eos> How do you do it?<eos> What's your secret?<eos> How was your first day at school?<eos> I think it went really, really well. Very well indeed.<eos> I'm just so happy to be there.<eos> I'll just put my things away and then I'll be right back down to help you with supper!
Uh, we're both glad to be back home.<eos> Why were you walking with that orphan girl?<eos> Why not?<eos> She's a loon.<eos> Says you.<eos> Hope you didn't get any asylum cooties.<eos> Uh-oh... there's one.<eos> Besides, I don't care where she's from.<eos> A cute girl is a cute girl.<eos> I don't know what you think you were doing walking with Gilbert Blythe. I...
Sit down!<eos> Sweet merciful Lord.<eos> Josie Pye.<eos> Read Campbell's Pleasures of Hope, The Downfall of Poland.<eos> I've got to fix a bit of fence down yonder.<eos> So... I've been meaning to attend to it.<eos> Lunch is in an hour.<eos> Well, I best get it done, you know, before I forget again.<eos> So I might, uh, might be late.<eos> Jerry'll help you unload.
Jerry'll help you unload.<eos> Walk on, Belle. Allons.<eos> Hey, uh, I, uh, thought you might like to try one.<eos> They're from our orchard.<eos> They're real sweet.<eos> Please go away.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> You need to walk away right now.<eos> I-I'm sorry, I, uh, can't...<eos> I'm not supposed to talk to you!
Do you know a word called "eedrope"?<eos> Eedrop...<eos> Anne told me not to do it.<eos> Eedrop.<eos> Don't think I know that one.<eos> I never saw Anne's beat for knowing big words.<eos> I bet she does very well at school.<eos> Hey...<eos> Carrots!<eos> I'm not talking to you!
You just did.<eos> Shirley!<eos> Get up here! Now!<eos> What a vicious display!<eos> Is this what they taught you in that orphanage?<eos> Unacceptable!<eos> "Anne Shirley has a very bad temper."<eos> Now, stand here and stay put.<eos> And the rest of you, pipe down!<eos> Let this serve as a lesson to you that we do not tolerate such displays of temper here in a civilized society.
I was born here and I grew up here.<eos> We are going to raise an army to invade England and avenge the death of our father.<eos> Will you come with us?<eos> Would you really want me to come with you?<eos> We will need all the help we can get.<eos> After all, don't you have a reason?<eos> I also have a reason to stay here.<eos> I understand you are inviting other rulers to come and join your army.<eos> Don't you think some of them will be envious when they see the size and understand the value of this trading station?<eos> It depends, I suppose, on what is more important to you.
I do not trust him.<eos> I know he is not Ivar...<eos> And yet, he is Ivar.<eos> You should look to improve your own security.<eos> If the gods don't protect me, then who can?<eos> What's her name?<eos> I think it is Tanaruz.<eos> She's very frightened, Helga.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> I won't hurt you.
I didn't know him either.<eos> Turns out his father is an Earl.<eos> An Earl?<eos> Why did you not say so?<eos> Because he's the Earl and I'm not.<eos> They call me Egil the Bastard.<eos> But you would like to be Earl?<eos> It's good that we have met, Egil.<eos> We need ambitious men.<eos> I still have a bone to pick with you, Sigurd.
She had eyes only for you and for Harbard.<eos> To me, she was cold and distant.<eos> So you feel sorry for yourself?<eos> Poor little Sigurd.<eos> You're wrong, Ivar.<eos> I don't feel sorry for myself.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right. No.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I'm telling you the truth.
Poor little Sigurd.<eos> You're wrong, Ivar.<eos> I don't feel sorry for myself.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right. No.<eos> Of course not.<eos> I'm telling you the truth.<eos> I have very good reason not to feel so angry with Lagertha.<eos> Then what kind of a son are you?<eos> What does it matter what your mother did to you?
I wanted to see my family.<eos> I also wanted to warn you.<eos> You mean, Ecbert sent you.<eos> No.<eos> I came of my own devising.<eos> There is much talk of the revenge of the sons of Ragnar.<eos> I wanted you all to be aware of it, and prepared for it.<eos> You need not have concerned yourself as to travel so far.<eos> Why should I not be aware of the habits of the heathen?<eos> I promise you, we are already well prepared for any incursions into our kingdom.
Are you going to go home?<eos> I know what I have to do.<eos> I want to make you all an offer.<eos> Anyone from our homelands who wants good, rich lands to farm can come and live in my kingdom.<eos> There will always be a part of Frankia which is a part of us.<eos> Us?<eos> You are no longer a part of "us," Rollo.<eos> But what is "us," Floki, is changing.<eos> Only you won't accept it.<eos> And so I say the same to you.

Leave us.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're not a slave anymore.<eos> - You can't decide that. - I can.<eos> I am the son of Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> I don't care about Lagertha.<eos> You are now a free woman.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you'll have to be free in order to marry one of us.<eos> I want to talk to you about books, Alfred.
Yes. Thank God.<eos> Just in this place.<eos> Just here.<eos> This is where the pagan died.<eos> Then it is a sacred place.<eos> How dare you say such things?<eos> - Are you mad?<eos> - I may be. But since I love some of you, I urge you again to take heed of my warning.<eos> The sons of Ragnar are sure to come!<eos> As for you, sweet sister, I counsel you, have a care for your own soul.
Are you joking?<eos> It is almost tiresome to hear the poets talk of all your exploits.<eos> I'm sorry it was tiresome.<eos> Perhaps we should have done things a more interesting way.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> That is the fault of the poets, not you.<eos> And who is this?<eos> This is Torvi, my son Bjorn's companion.<eos> And this is Astrid, one of my shield-maidens.<eos> I leave you in their company.
- We'll see.<eos> - Really?<eos> You had no right to free my slaves without my permission.<eos> I don't remember you asking permission to kill my mother.<eos> That's different.<eos> I am Queen now.<eos> I know.<eos> I just don't know for how long.<eos> Ubbe!<eos> I wanted to tell you.
How can you go with Ivar, when he wants to kill your mother?<eos> We're brothers.<eos> We want to kill Aelle.<eos> Nothing else matters right now, woman.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course it matters.<eos> It matters to me even if it doesn't matter to you!<eos> Listen!<eos> I did not come back here to be told what to do.<eos> Not by you, not by anyone!
So, who's this?<eos> Her name is Tanaruz.<eos> You brought her back?<eos> She'll make a good slave, I'm sure.<eos> She is not a slave.<eos> We are adopting her.<eos> She is my child.<eos> Well, let's see.<eos> Shh, it's all right.<eos> I won't hurt you.

We raid this entire land, so that they never have a chance to assemble another army again.<eos> Why would we even want to stay here?<eos> It is what our father wanted.<eos> He didn't just want to win battles.<eos> He wanted land here.<eos> He wanted to make settlements so our people could live and they could work.<eos> Mmm. And we all know what happened.<eos> Yes, but in those days he did not hold a king to ransom, nor did he have a great army.<eos> We do.<eos> What about you, Sigurd?

Well, since you do ask me, my opinion is that we should take the land.<eos> But I have one condition...<eos> That Ecbert dies.<eos> And that I Blood Eagle him.<eos> Otherwise, there is no deal.<eos> You wouldn't be able to stand up long enough to Blood Eagle him.<eos> I imagine me sitting.<eos> I accept your offer of land.<eos> But for what you did to my father... You must die.<eos> Then I'll tell you what it is I want.
I accept your offer of land.<eos> But for what you did to my father... You must die.<eos> Then I'll tell you what it is I want.<eos> All I want is to choose the manner of my own death.<eos> I agree.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Bjorn Ironside, son of Ragnar.<eos> I, King Ecbert, give you the right to settle the lands of East Anglia.
Skol!<eos> As for me... I want to go with Bjorn.<eos> I want to see the Mediterranean.<eos> Then it seems, the only thing<eos> that really kept the sons of Ragnar together was the death of their father.<eos> Poor Bjorn!<eos> It is you who doesn't want to keep the army together.<eos> It is you who wants to go away to sunny places.<eos> Everyone else can follow me.<eos> I do not want to follow you, Ivar.
You have the mind of a child!<eos> And all you do is play music, Sigurd!<eos> - I'm just as much a son of Ragnar as you are.<eos> - I'm not so sure.<eos> As far as I remember, Ragnar didn't play the oud.<eos> And he certainly didn't offer his arse to other men!<eos> You make me laugh. Just like you do when you crawl around like a baby.<eos> Shut your mouth!<eos> Enough!<eos> This has nothing to do with you!
You really think it's better she continue to stay at home?<eos> Yes.<eos> That is, I wouldn't say "school" again until she's said it herself.<eos> And she will.<eos> She won't be underfoot forever.<eos> Truth is, I'm torn.<eos> Bright as she is, she had such a difficult start in life, she isn't always...<eos> equipped for certain things.<eos> she had such a longing for school.<eos> Bide your time, I'm telling you.
- You've got Diana.<eos> She can't like me when no one else does! Don't you see? !<eos> - Calm yourself.<eos> - And Gil...<eos> Well, there's a boy whose sole purpose in life is to humiliate me!<eos> - Stuff and nonsense.<eos> - I don't fit in!<eos> You're going back to school tomorrow and that's final.<eos> Matthew Cuthbert, the time has come to end this foolishness.<eos> I have allowed you to interfere and coddle that child!
Katie?<eos> Katie, is that you?<eos> Katie Maurice are you in there?<eos> Please, Katie.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm sorry I had to leave you at Mrs. Hammond's.<eos> You have no idea how grateful I'd be if you'd visit me here.<eos> Katie?<eos> Idle hands are the devil's workshop.<eos> So if it's alright with you, even though you know best, I would like to suggest that she return to school tomorrow.
I'm sure you're both wondering how the school day went.<eos> I'm pleased to report it wasn't as bad as I thought.<eos> I enjoyed myself.<eos> Well, that's just fine.<eos> Do you not have homework?<eos> Where are your books?<eos> Oh, I didn't need to bring them home today.<eos> I'll go put this down on the bench.<eos> Hello, Katie?<eos> I brought you your favourite flower.
And I fear preparing myself to be a wife will be a powerful challenge for you, Marilla.<eos> Admittedly...<eos> I'm very homely and clumsy.<eos> It'll be a big surprise to both of us if I marry someday.<eos> I certainly never expected to, but if God decrees it...<eos> Will you please go in the barn and see if there's anything needs doing?<eos> I need to hear myself think.<eos> Marilla wants me to find some outdoor chores to do.<eos> Jerry's in the loft.<eos> He'll tell you what needs doing.
My brother's apprentice as a blacksmith. The other learns to become a butcher.<eos> I could be a smithy, I suppose.<eos> But what do you want, Jerry?<eos> ! You could be a cartographer or an aviator.<eos> You could even lead a safari!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Come on, Jerry, use your imagination!<eos> No, seriously, I don't know any of those words.<eos> Well, you get the idea.<eos> And I'm not sure about you, but suddenly I feel absolutely ablaze with possibility!
You know the stove's gone cold?<eos> My, my.<eos> This is unlike you.<eos> I have no idea what's "like me."<eos> None at all.<eos> I'll light the stove.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I suppose your mind is burdened, then, by the minister's visit.<eos> Oh, everything is just peaches and cream, thank you for asking.<eos> Now, is there anything I can... bake or clean, or mend or fetch for you?
It doesn't matter what the other girls think, Ruby, it matters what you think.<eos> And I, for one, think Anne is marvellous and brave.<eos> I'll visit soon, alright?<eos> It's alright.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm sure no one will think you're my friend.<eos> I reckon we should be off.<eos> Now, I'd like the two of you to go upstairs to bed for a few hours.<eos> You both need rest after that terrible night.<eos> I can help you, Marilla.
Princess Cordelia?<eos> Well... she's a wise and solitary princess.<eos> She wears dresses of the finest silk and velvet with puff sleeves and ever so many flounces.<eos> One day... Princess Cordelia arrived at the most beautiful kingdom in the world.<eos> She knew not a soul and was worried no one would like her.<eos> All my dresses will be ruined from the smoke!<eos> You can borrow one of mine.<eos> I have two!<eos> A week really isn't that long when you plan out all the things you want to do.<eos> Maybe you could start by imagining what colour you want your room to be.
Marilla was always a very practical person.<eos> I'll use this as a pattern for the size, but everything else will be au courant.<eos> Vivienne? Please take down these measurements.<eos> Thank you, dear.<eos> I'm not worried about the cost.<eos> Just as long as she likes it.<eos> This dress will be her dream come true.<eos> And I'll give you the "old friend" discount.<eos> That's, uh...<eos> That's very kind of you, Jeannie.
It's called a feather stitch.<eos> And of course I will.<eos> You knew I collected buttons.<eos> I told you when you walked me home that time.<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> We were all so sorry when your brother passed away.<eos> Of course.<eos> Anne's dress should be ready in about a week.<eos> Very kind of you, Jeannie.<eos> It was good to see you.
You're the Cuthbert's new charge, aren't you? Yes.<eos> I've heard nice things about you. And how is Marilla?<eos> Still feisty, I hope?<eos> Dad, what are you doing?<eos> You shouldn't be walking!<eos> My son worries too much.<eos> It seems this young lady has urgent business. With you.<eos> I'll go inside now.<eos> I'll fetch your chair. I'll go on my own, thank you, son.<eos> It was nice to meet you.
"believe also in me.<eos> "In my Father's house are many mansions. "If it were not so,<eos> "I go to prepare a place for you.<eos> "And if I go and prepare a place for you,<eos> "I will come again, and receive you unto myself;<eos> for where I am, there ye may be also."<eos> All the city folks are wearing them. Why don't you like it?<eos> Other than the fact that it's too big for your head?<eos> Room to grow.<eos> I'm sure it'll fit better when you acquire some more brains.
Anne, please tell Ruby that it's alright to say...<eos> I'm thinking perhaps I should get on home.<eos> - What?<eos> - Why?<eos> I'm sure Marilla must be needing my help... with something.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> We're almost there.<eos> Hold my hand.<eos> I'm so nervous!<eos> - We're sorry for your loss. - It's a shepherd's pie. We made it together especially for you.
Now, you'll settle up today, Matthew.<eos> So, uh... bit of a cold snap, eh?<eos> True enough.<eos> Uh, the other day at the, uh...<eos> I-I noticed you had to leave a couple fields go fallow.<eos> I'll let you know if I'm going to sell. Oh.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I just, um...<eos> I only wanted you to know that me and my hand Jerry, we'd be real happy to help out.<eos> We'll come on over in the spring if you like. Get you back up and running. That's very kind.
What do you care? We need a guy to show her she's not so smart.<eos> She's smart.<eos> Deal with it.<eos> Why you gotta be like that, bud?<eos> [chuckling] Why don't you bust out a book and take care of it yourself?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> - I'll give you a tip, okay?<eos> I'm not your bud.<eos> Yeah, right. [chuckling]<eos> And if you ever hassle Anne again, you'll regret it.
- This is an important journey. - [Jerry singing]<eos> I will kill you with my bare hands!<eos> [footsteps] Hello there.<eos> I see you've been here before.<eos> Only in my dreams.<eos> How may I help you today?<eos> I am here to return a dress.<eos> - Is something wrong with it?<eos> - Not a thing.<eos> - Do you not like it?
For the Crown?<eos> I'm sorry, that's all I can reveal.<eos> [chuckling] What a crock.<eos> - Amethyst.<eos> Don't care.<eos> That is a very special brooch.<eos> Not to me.<eos> It's been in our family for generations.<eos> So keep it.<eos> Maybe I can give you a small sum for it.
I'm sorry to hear about Mr. Cuthbert taking sick and all those troubles.<eos> It still seems unreal.<eos> Even though I just sold all our...<eos> Everything.<eos> - But thank you.<eos> - He's a good man.<eos> He offered to help me with my land come spring.<eos> I love him with all my heart.<eos> I don't know what I'd do if...<eos> I owe you an apology.

I don't know what I'd do if...<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - I should apologize to you. - No, you shouldn't.<eos> I was rude.<eos> - But it was my fault.<eos> - Can we please not argue for once?<eos> Can you please stop contradicting me?<eos> Gilbert, I am very sorry that I wasn't more sensitive about your father, and what losing him really meant for you.
You want to spell out a few words for old times' sake?<eos> How about... "truce"?<eos> - T-R-U-C-E. - [both chuckling]<eos> Moody would've gotten that wrong. He would've!<eos> [laughing]<eos> - Get away from her!<eos> - Stop, Jerry!<eos> Stop! Stop! I know him!<eos> Jerry, what happened to you?<eos> Are you alright?
- Yes?<eos> - We're here to see Miss Josephine Barry.<eos> Is she at home?<eos> - Who shall I say is calling?<eos> - Anne of Green Gables.<eos> Oh, for heaven's sake, Rollings, these are my guests!<eos> Come in, come in, come in from the cold!<eos> I was beginning to think you weren't coming.<eos> Oh, my dear Anne, it's very good to see you.<eos> Dear me! Whatever's happened to you?
If you do write a book someday, I pray you won't need one.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, not at all, not at all.<eos> Rollings?<eos> Madam.<eos> Jerry, I have something for you too.<eos> You're going to stay on at Green Gables and I'm going to pay for it.<eos> - Oh, Miss Barry, I've already...<eos> - This is a business arrangement.<eos> I'm offering you a job at fair wages that happens to be at Green Gables.
Help me get him to bed.<eos> And I couldn't have found your Anna more delightful if I tried.<eos> I didn't know she sold it.<eos> It made her so very happy to help.<eos> I don't want her suffering... because of me.<eos> Do you think she'd ever recover from losing you this way?<eos> Matthew, you know too well the impact of an untimely death.<eos> Anne has suffered so much loss.<eos> She finally belongs. Here.<eos> With you.
Take care.<eos> How could you?<eos> How could you even think it? !<eos> You would've left us that way?<eos> Left me?<eos> The thought of... of being...<eos> I...<eos> I-I couldn't.<eos> But I won't leave you.<eos> I won't leave you and Anne.
Well, if I wasn't in my first year, you know...<eos> Listen, I'm gonna be late back here tonight, so... here.<eos> - In case you need a place to crash.<eos> - Wow.<eos> That's very--<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hopefully, I'll get my shit together.<eos> Yeah, just give me a second. I'm just stepping out.<eos> - What's up, man?<eos> How are you? - I'm good, I'm good.
Got it.<eos> What the f--<eos> Whoa, dude!<eos> Dig the digs!<eos> Bitchin' kitchen, man!<eos> Soft-closing cabinets.<eos> Someone paid a premium for this IKEA shit.<eos> - Yeah, well, I...<eos> - Wow, dude.<eos> It's a good thing you didn't bite on my place, man. You waited for this sweet spot.
But I also felt trapped.<eos> And I still do.<eos> It used to come and go, this feeling...<eos> - London.<eos> London--<eos> - But now it's just, like, all the time.<eos> London...<eos> It's okay.<eos> You came to the right place.<eos> We can help you.
And I still do.<eos> It used to come and go, this feeling...<eos> - London.<eos> London--<eos> - But now it's just, like, all the time.<eos> London...<eos> It's okay.<eos> You came to the right place.<eos> We can help you.<eos> WAKE can help you.
We can help you.<eos> WAKE can help you.<eos> What?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> - This is your store, huh?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you, yeah.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Dude, I gotta get a picture of you next to that sign, man, come on.
Thank you.<eos> So this is a wine spot? That it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I mean, we have a little bit to do on the reno side of it, but...<eos> Uh, wait.<eos> Uh, who's-- who's "we"?<eos> "We" are us.<eos> I just thought since you're a skilled carpenter, you could help out.<eos> So when you said "we" you meant "me"?<eos> I'm helping you, as your sponsor.
Look, this is just an opportunity for you to, you know, show up.<eos> Do the work. Make amends.<eos> I'm grateful for the opportunity.<eos> It's just...<eos> I'm not sure you're doing it for the right reasons.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's... it's funny that, uh, you want me to do an honest day's work right around the time that you've got a lot of work to be done.<eos> - Hey, man. I'm your sponsor.<eos> - I know, and I wanna help you.

And I know that it was hurtful, those things that I said, and I'm sorry.<eos> You been going to meetings?<eos> I have, yeah.<eos> You looking for a sponsor?<eos> Actually, no. I got one.<eos> Dennis.<eos> Dennis?<eos> Well, I woulda asked you, but--<eos> But you can't manipulate me like you can Dennis.<eos> He's too light in the pants to stand up to you.
Give me a break, Chip.<eos> Dennis ain't here. He can't hear you.<eos> Since when are you lookin' out for Dennis? I'm not lookin' out for Dennis.<eos> I'm lookin' for Dennis.<eos> - Does he know what this is about or...?<eos> - He better not.<eos> Hang on, George.<eos> I know what it's about.<eos> Rosa and Dennis are dating and...<eos> I know that you don't like the fact that Dennis is lying to you--
- Oh, okay.<eos> Hey, Chip.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Hey, man.<eos> How you doing, Chip?<eos> - Hey, hey!<eos> - Good to see you, brother.<eos> Is this you?
It's a step in the right direction.<eos> Wait.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> - Wait, wait, don't go. Don't leave me.<eos> - You only run if you're guilty.<eos> - Thank you, boys!<eos> - No problem.<eos> George, look, I'm sorry. I did not know that she was your daughter, and I swear to God, I did not deep-dick her.<eos> Would you please shut the fuck up?<eos> - I'm not here to hurt you.
I don't know.<eos> See you later.<eos> - Hello. - Hi.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Do you smoke?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> - Do I smell? - A little.<eos> Hey, I don't care. I'm just surprised.<eos> I think I'll have one of these.<eos> So you don't care whether I smoke or not?
Hi. - You're up early.<eos> - I went to the hospital.<eos> Leopold wasn't there.<eos> You said he would be. - I guess I did.<eos> - I talked to Grete as well.<eos> She asked if I could feel my grief and let go of it.<eos> Here. And here.<eos> - Ravn!<eos> - I'm sorry, Siv, I just...<eos> - I really wanted to help you. - Help me? Help you move on.
- I'm sorry...<eos> - Do you realise what you've done?<eos> - I tried...<eos> - Get out!<eos> - I don't want to see you right now! - I'm sorry...<eos> Out!<eos> I'M THE WORLD'S BIGGEST IDIOT!<eos> WHAT HAPPENED?<eos> ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?<eos> I'M OK AS LONG AS YOU ARE.
MISS YOU LIKE CRAZY!<eos> Wait here.<eos> Damn it.<eos> MISS YOU TOO, TEO.<eos> I HAVE TO SEE YOU!<eos> I KNOW, BUT IT'S TOO RISKY.<eos> I'M SCARED.<eos> I THINK SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH THE BABY.<eos> GO TO A DOCTOR!<eos> NO, I ONLY TRUST YOU.
MISS YOU TOO, TEO.<eos> I HAVE TO SEE YOU!<eos> I KNOW, BUT IT'S TOO RISKY.<eos> I'M SCARED.<eos> I THINK SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH THE BABY.<eos> GO TO A DOCTOR!<eos> NO, I ONLY TRUST YOU.<eos> IT HURTS, TEO!<eos> DON'T WORRY.<eos> I'LL TEXT YOU THE TIME AND PLACE.
HEY, SWEETIE, LET'S NAME OUR DAUGHTER AGNES!<eos> AGNES IS GREAT!<eos> COME AND TALK TO ME.<eos> Fuck it!<eos> Bloody...<eos> I'll need one of your rats.<eos> What for?<eos> I'll use its spleen to filter Vilma's antibodies.<eos> If I can replicate them, maybe I can produce a serum. - That won't help her.<eos> - No, but it might help you.
But I do want you to feel like you have a voice in this.<eos> So, not only is my office door always open to you, I've actually had it removed.<eos> That's a very powerful metaphor, boss.<eos> That's a very powerful metaphor, boss.<eos> Kenny, thanks for keeping it light.<eos> So good.<eos> Happy birthday!<eos> - What are you doing in here?<eos> - You said that you were too busy to get away from the office to celebrate.<eos> So I brought the celebration to you.
- Okay.<eos> Um, I'm also on an iron supplement.<eos> - Is that...<eos> - An issue?<eos> No.<eos> Let's just get you on that table, huh?<eos> Come on.<eos> No, okay, not happening.<eos> I'm having flashbacks.<eos> I don't know if I ever told you this, but when I was kid, I fell into a well.
Actually, Cam, this is very peaceful.<eos> It was a torture chamber.<eos> I was in there one minute, and I cried.<eos> I feel so rested.<eos> I do, I do, I really do.<eos> Now you.<eos> It's all good.<eos> There you go.<eos> All right.<eos> And I will be right here beside you.

Seriously, the roof?<eos> I've been looking for you everywhere.<eos> I just needed some space and some fresh air.<eos> It smells so purple.<eos> Okay, you're going in that tube. Come on.<eos> Seriously, that's as hard as you can pull?<eos> I am not the weak one here.<eos> You're the one who won't even get a simple medical test.<eos> What are you... scared?<eos> Huh? You're chicken?
Yeah, and I thought I made that clear in there when I peed a little.<eos> Fine, you just go ahead and die.<eos> And I'll raise Lily by myself, and she will never step foot in another farm or circus.<eos> I will haunt you.<eos> Or you could just get your head checked so we don't lose you over some stupid fear.<eos> Do you know what I went through in that well on October 14, 1987, while the whole world was focused on that media whore Jessica?<eos> - She was a baby, but yeah.<eos> - It was hell.<eos> And I would not have survived if those firemen wouldn't have figured out a way to lower my little Aunt Edna into that we and touch my feet and tell me it was gonna be okay and that I wasn't alone.<eos> Cam, if there's a way that I could be in there with you, I would, but I...

If the scan shows that you're fine, you can suck it, because this mechanically-challenged daddy made this foot-rubbing machine all by himself.

It's fine.<eos> Let them eat cake.<eos> - What?<eos> - Is she kidding?<eos> That's not what I meant!<eos> - Claire, breathe.<eos> - No, no!<eos> Gloria, we're done.<eos> Don't scream at me.<eos> I just wanted to make you happy.

He looks so peaceful.<eos> He's had such a rough day.<eos> When I tried to wake him up last time, he got so upset.<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> - Who raised you?<eos> - Fine, just be gentle, okay?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Also, don't touch this.<eos> It's my art project.<eos> - Oh, can I help you with that?
I mean, science. You got that.<eos> Organizing your sock drawer, you're the king.<eos> But understanding how other people are feeling, that's a weak spot for you.<eos> I have gotten much better at that. Have you?<eos> How am I feeling right now?<eos> What the... How should I know?<eos> Itchy?<eos> Give me the first letter.<eos> You and I are in a relationship.<eos> I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.
Leonard?<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's something on the windshield.<eos> You need a break?<eos> Do not need a break.<eos> There's no shame in asking for a break.<eos> If I need a break, I'll ask for a break! Ugh.<eos> Leonard?<eos> Yeah?<eos> There's a tree on you.
It's like hating a frozen yogurt machine.<eos> She doesn't hate you, stop saying that.<eos> Now you hate me too!<eos> Shh, I don't hate you.<eos> It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues.<eos> And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they're doing a good job.<eos> Bernadette, you are doing a good job.<eos> Thank you, Sheldon, I'm feeling better now.<eos> Thank you, Internet.<eos> I'm telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy.
Art is here too.<eos> I'm sorry, Sarah.<eos> There's no more wiggle room.<eos> You can call it a truce or whatever, but they're going to want you all to come on in.<eos> What about Cosima?<eos> Yo, Sarah.<eos> Apparently, they're keen on me staying here.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> No, I'm at Dyad.<eos> Cos, what about you? What about your cure?
If it proves efficacious on me, then I'm to expand treatment to all the LEDA sisters.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> I think those were my exact words too.<eos> How are you...<eos> Hey! Hey!<eos> Sounds like she's got work to do.<eos> Cosima's on the mend, Alison in her craft room.<eos> Sarah.<eos> Wouldn't you like to go home?<eos> Rachel's offering everything that's been taken from you.
Mum?<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> You all right?<eos> We're good, Sarah.<eos> Looking forward to being back in our own house.<eos> It's okay, Mum.<eos> We're fine now.<eos> You're not going along with this, are you?<eos> I am.<eos> It's all down to you now, Sarah.
Well, you're crafty, aren't you?<eos> Come on, look at this shit.<eos> Start your Christmas cards, knit a sweater.<eos> The easier you make this for us, the easier you make it on my new partner here.<eos> Just ride it out, Alison.<eos> But they better turn up soon.<eos> Hello, you're back.<eos> My babies.<eos> Helena, the... The operation was good.<eos> They removed the impaled object and you're gonna be fine.
Okay.<eos> You're actually here.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Aw, touching.<eos> Why don't you choke on your own vomit?<eos> Piss off.<eos> I will, and I am.<eos> Just as long as when the final bell tolls at school today,<eos> Rachel picks up Kira and takes her for her first Dyad visit.<eos> The principal is aware that Aunty Rachel shares a loose custody due to... Well... You.
I did!<eos> You did, actually.<eos> This time, you're gonna go out the front door with your daughter by the hand.<eos> Come on, let's go. Okay.<eos> Off to school then?<eos> Uncle Felix says the trick on the first day of school is to find the biggest kid in the yard and hit him in the nose.<eos> What?<eos> What do you think?<eos> No.<eos> Good, because I don't want you stressing over anything today?
The wound is no longer visible.<eos> "No longer visible", what does that mean?<eos> Frankly, I'm not sure.<eos> It's remarkable.<eos> So, Charlotte told me that you met Mr Westmorland?<eos> He came and looked at me.<eos> When was that?<eos> After the French doctor.<eos> She says Delphine was very nice.<eos> Did... Did he tell you what kind of cancer you have?
They think I'm with you.<eos> Look, with your network down,<eos> MK thinks that she might be able to get Sarah and Kira away.<eos> Really?<eos> How?<eos> I've been hiding a long time, Sarah.<eos> If you can get Kira out from under their surveillance, then I can move you today.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, MK, you're with us now.<eos> All right? And there's nobody who can help you more than our sister Cosima.
Helena, calm down, she is a neonatal doctor, not a Neo.<eos> My babies are special like Kira.<eos> They want our biologies.<eos> You're saying the baby healed in, like, hours?<eos> Yes.<eos> Like Sarah, I make miracle babies.<eos> The doctor wants to cut it from my belly.<eos> Argh! I have to go.<eos> Jesus, Helena, where?<eos> I will tell you, but on pain of your doozy heart.
You'll be all right? Alison?<eos> Felix, make sure they get a good look at you.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Hello, bastards.<eos> So we're going into MK's underground.<eos> What does that look like?<eos> Well, we meet a driver who takes us to another driver, and then another...<eos> She knows what she's doing.<eos> MK says that when you do this the door closes behind you forever.<eos> Sarah, you know that you and Kira can never come back.
What time is it?<eos> Bell rings in two hours.<eos> There must be at least a dozen men between here and the school.<eos> But thanks to our misspent youth, I can get in and out via the basement, no problem.<eos> When we do this, they are going to come down on you hard.<eos> So, you have to make sure that Mika is safe and stable.<eos> She's going to drive us off to the lab.<eos> And Scott will take care of her good.<eos> Sarah, look at this.<eos> Something you will enjoy.
Excuse me, there's a man who's following me, there.<eos> Do you see him? Do you recognise that man?<eos> Hi, can I help you?<eos> I'm picking up my wife and daughter, blonde, down the hall there.<eos> Right, could you come with me to the office, sir?<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey!<eos> Sir, I'm going to have to report you.<eos> Hi, hey, this way.<eos> Are you clear?
I know, I'm watching you.<eos> You have to leave.<eos> I can't, I can't.<eos> Go back to Kira.<eos> No. I'm here now.<eos> I'm not leaving without you.<eos> Open up.<eos> Sarah. Lock the door, get your stuff.<eos> We need to go.<eos> I told you, I'm too tired, Sarah.
He's coming up.<eos> Get your stuff.<eos> No, I'm not going.<eos> What?<eos> Give me your clothes.<eos> I'll pretend to be you.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> No, no.<eos> There's no time.<eos> I'll buy you time.
Sarah...<eos> Just let me, let me.<eos> She's not dead.<eos> She's dead, I know it!<eos> You couldn't know that. Please.<eos> You can't know that.<eos> I don't feel her any more!<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I want to know why I am like this.<eos> And I don't want to go with you!
It's okay.<eos> - Max, go away.<eos> Out. - No, no, no.<eos> It's not good time.<eos> Later.<eos> A fifteen-second acceleration whenever you want.<eos> Good.<eos> We need girls, cheerleaders.<eos> Right?<eos> Exactly. Maybe we should get you some pom-poms.
1,500 meters and five kilometers at Moscow University.<eos> My mother always pushed me to swim, to ski.<eos> I realized that some people are using something.<eos> Last year, he was nobody.<eos> Next year, he has muscles.<eos> Of course, I also started to use the best of the best, stanozolol.<eos> And all injections were done by my mother.<eos> And, of course, it was 50 milligrams, this simple thing.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Your mother injected you?
- And that one, I just took.<eos> Is that enough?<eos> Or do I need any more?<eos> It's okay.<eos> - Three, three, three.<eos> - I hear you got the real code.<eos> I am mafia.<eos> This is mafia.<eos> Chased by WADA.<eos> Could you imagine, the best laboratory will be puzzled with your piss?
Okay, we have Terminal One, departing flight.<eos> - Yeah. - ♪ I am a woman in love ♪<eos> Keep it.<eos> It's my donation.<eos> - No, no, no. I have a lot, you see.<eos> All people are presenting me with pens, so I have full collection.<eos> - Remember me.<eos> - I will.<eos> - So I'm gonna see you...<eos> - So, so, so nice with you.
You are a victim of your ideas.<eos> August 21st.<eos> See you at the end.<eos> And good luck tomorrow.<eos> Start time tomorrow morning, 7:15.<eos> - Right here.<eos> - I am like a priest.<eos> I am healing your doping paranoia.<eos> You are free.<eos> You have enough power, and God is with you.
Where did Grigory go?<eos> I've been crying.<eos> Yes, I am with him, and I think maybe you want to speak with him.<eos> Maybe he's a little bit nervous.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - Bryan.<eos> I'm not... I'm sorry.<eos> I'm trying to understand what you're saying.<eos> I'm absolutely saying that we will overturn all this bullshit, and it will be upside down.<eos> So, Bryan, I hardly could talk to you tonight.
"Today?" "Yes, today."<eos> And I resigned.<eos> And... they lost director.<eos> I have a lot of calls, but I'm just changing my telephones.<eos> People are looking for their job, but laboratory is almost empty.<eos> Empty.<eos> I don't know what's going on.<eos> I just know what I'm reading in the newspaper and in the press and... You know.<eos> Oh, really? Really?<eos> I mean, will they come after you?
What do you want to, uh...<eos> It's very suspicious when you have one-way ticket, you know.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> You have to book a round trip.<eos> They're watching us.<eos> - Bryan?<eos> What I am doing, myself, I can do nothing.<eos> - So...<eos> - Okay?<eos> I'll send you...
For me, it was totally shocking.<eos> Especially "ignorance is strength."<eos> This is the most powerful thing.<eos> It was my weapon.<eos> It gave me definitions, it gave me coordinates how you can apply to your life.<eos> It's like a road map.<eos> "'There are three stages in your reintegration, ' said O'Brien.<eos> 'There is learning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance.<eos> It's time for you to enter upon the first stage.'"<eos> I was thinking that we'd start... I ask you questions, and you answer "yes" or "no."
The former head of Russia's anti-doping agency RUSADA has unexpectedly died.<eos> Nikita Kamaev's death comes just two months after he resigned his post, which is, obviously, following the doping scandal that has rocked Russia and the rest of the world in athletics.<eos> I have to see.<eos> We're told by RUSADA, which is the doping agency he was formerly the head of, that he appears to have had a massive heart attack.<eos> Of course.<eos> Bryan?<eos> I'm here.<eos> You know, my friend?<eos> My friend... died.<eos> I show you.
You're always gonna be the bad guy with her.<eos> Hey, Casey!<eos> I brought you a chocolate cake.<eos> I make amazing cakes.<eos> I won three bakeoffs at my church.<eos> This is my brother Evan.<eos> He drove me here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks for the cake.<eos> Thank you for today.
I'll just hang here.<eos> Here you go.<eos> It's been washed twice... once by me and once by my mom.<eos> 'Cause that's my mom.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That was nice of you to punch that girl in the face for my sister.<eos> Oh, yeah, you're welcome.<eos> Hey, do you want to go out sometime?<eos> Go out?<eos> With you?
This isn't what I thought it would smell like.<eos> Yeah. My roommate makes a lot of ramen.<eos> Sometimes, being touched makes me... jumpy.<eos> It has to be hard touch, uh, pressure.<eos> I like pressure.<eos> I don't like soft.<eos> Is that okay to say on the first date?<eos> Aah! What the hell?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry. What is wrong with you?
What's wrong?<eos> Sam?<eos> Here.<eos> Careful, it's hot.<eos> Hey, dude, don't feel too bad.<eos> The first time's always a shit show.<eos> My first time was on a pingpong table, and it collapsed like two seconds in.<eos> My balls got all wrapped up in the net.<eos> Really freaked her out.<eos> How about you, Case?
Really freaked her out.<eos> How about you, Case?<eos> Was it crappy your first time?<eos> Okay, gross.<eos> I'm not discussing my sex life in front of my brother.<eos> Not that there's anything to discuss.<eos> Sometimes, I wish I was normal.<eos> Well, dude... nobody's normal.<eos> In fourth grade, my biology teacher, Mr. Durocher he was fat said penguins are similar to humans... because once they copulate, they stay with the same partner for life.<eos> So, what about you?
Yeah?<eos> Well, good for them.<eos> So, how are you feeling now?<eos> Still ready to give up on dating?<eos> I don't know.<eos> My dad said to find someone who appreciates me for what I am, which is a weirdo.<eos> We talked a lot.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> And that makes sense.<eos> You're easy to talk to.
Don't shut the door...!<eos> And somewhere, unnoticed...<eos> Sorry!<eos> ..in silence or in darkness...<eos> Dammit!<eos> ..it has already begun.<eos> You talking to yourself in there?<eos> I'm meditating.<eos> You've been in there for hours.<eos> I've been trying to talk to you.

Those guys have modelled every event in human history to find our weak spot.<eos> Are you going to do the same in a couple of minutes?<eos> Would you make the deal?<eos> No, not if I had a choice.<eos> But we don't, do we?<eos> It's your world.<eos> Not any more.<eos> Ok, back to the pyramid and negotiate our surrender.<eos> Doctor?<eos> What are you going to do? Well for a start, I'm going to tell you the truth.

I didn't get my sight back.<eos> I've been lying to you.<eos> There's a combination lock, with numbers, and I can't see them.<eos> You're an idiot...<eos> You are the stupidest idiot ever!<eos> But I'm not going to let you die.<eos> No.<eos> You have to, there's no choice.<eos> No-one else can help me now.<eos> The Monks. The Monks can help you.
The Monks. The Monks can help you.<eos> No! Bill, no!<eos> Don't do that!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I made a mistake... I have to face that... but do not ask the Monks for help!<eos> Bill!<eos> Doctor. This planet needs you. So I'm making an executive decision.<eos> 'I'm keeping you alive.'<eos> Bill, listen to me, please.<eos> I don't know what consenting allows them to do to you!
I consent.<eos> You act out of love.<eos> Love is consent.<eos> We must be loved.<eos> Bill! Do not make this deal! I forbid it!<eos> Bill, can you hear me?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Bill? Bill?<eos> Bill, what have you done?<eos> I'll tell you what, old man...
How is Frank Trimble a â€œuniquely challenging foeâ€?<eos> He's not.<eos> I'm referring to time itself.<eos> As rivals go, it's undefeated.<eos> I just want you to know that if you tell me you're trying to build a flux capacitor, I'm out of here.<eos> Good night, Sherlock.<eos> Good night, Watson.<eos> What's that?<eos> You're gonna need it later on.<eos> I told you last night, as adversaries go, time itself was undefeated... but as of this morning, you can consider it defeated.

What do you want?<eos> Sorry to commandeer your vessel, Captain, but I'm afraid for what I have planned, you can't be in Storybrooke.<eos> Emma, are you there?<eos> Gideon... he sent me away.<eos> I would never leave you.<eos> What the hell do I have to do?<eos> Kill the Black Fairy.<eos> Did she harm you?<eos> She toughened me up.<eos> What did she do to you?
Now you want my help?<eos> You have a funny way of asking for a favor.<eos> I suspect, without a little nudging, I already know the answer, then.<eos> Answer's always the same.<eos> Then I suggest you reconsider, because given the protection spell I placed over him, it's impossible for him to return.<eos> I'll find a way.<eos> I have your tear, remember, Savior?<eos> I'm the only one that can bring him back.<eos> You tried to kill me with that sword, and you failed, and now you think you can bully me?<eos> I will never help you.
I will not give up my mission... or my word.<eos> "Others before him had cowered in fear becoming trapped in its web.<eos> The hero Gideon knew this, but he was undaunted.<eos> He fought valiantly until he slayed the Great Spider from the Echoless Forest and led the villagers to safety."<eos> Put it away, please!<eos> Put it away, Gideon!<eos> If she sees it, she'll know that you stole it from her.<eos> Who knows what she'll do.<eos> It's okay, Roderick.<eos> I won't let her hurt you.

No, child.<eos> Everything here belongs to me.<eos> I've read the inscription.<eos> My real mother gave it to me... so I'd remember to be a hero.<eos> I'm your real mother.<eos> You're not my mother.<eos> And you never will be!<eos> You want to be a hero, do you?<eos> Just like your real mum?<eos> Well, here's the truth, Dearie. Just because she was a hero doesn't make you one.

He's using him as a bargaining chip to force me to help him to kill the Black Fairy.<eos> - He did?<eos> - Yes, he did.<eos> Now, I know nothing about this Fairy, but I'm guessing you do.<eos> Yeah, she's my mother.<eos> She stole Gideon from the Blue Fairy, took him away to another realm where time moves differently, tortured him for 28 years.<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> To hurt me.<eos> Her own son?<eos> That tells you all you need to know about her.
Lock it away in my vault, would you?<eos> What is it?<eos> The key to my vault.<eos> It's missing.<eos> What?<eos> Stolen.<eos> Who would do such a thing?<eos> Down to the mines, my son.<eos> Find out who is responsible for this act of treason.<eos> And when you do, do as I've taught you... make them pay.
Sorry.<eos> Didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> Actually, yes, I did.<eos> Look what the tide brought in.<eos> Captain Hook.<eos> Evening, Blackbeard.<eos> By the sand on your britches, I'd say someone's been passed out on the beach again.<eos> It's part of a long journey home.<eos> A journey that's now interrupting my game.<eos> Judging by your dwindling chips, I'd say I've done you a favor.

You got one for me before, and I'm willing to bet that you have another one.<eos> And in return, that sorry lot of cheap jewelry you probably stole from some wench?<eos> I assure you, those are some of the finest jewels Agrabah has to offer.<eos> Agrabah?<eos> Sailing the high seas in a desert?<eos> Oh, you really have sunk to a new low.<eos> If the jewels aren't enough, I do have... one more thing I could offer.<eos> Oh, and what's that?<eos> Well, I hear tell that you haven't had a vessel for some time... not since you lost the Jolly Roger in Arendelle.<eos> I've been meaning to talk to you about that.
Wait, wait, wait!<eos> It was me.<eos> It was me.<eos> Well, then, little bug, it's time you learned your lesson, then.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?<eos> "And the hero Gideon fought valiantly until he slayed the Great Spider from the Echoless forest."<eos> Roderick?<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> Turns out I'm not.<eos> This must ease some of that guilt for you, learning I didn't die by the Black Fairy's hands all those years ago.
And how could I possibly do that?<eos> Be the hero you were meant to be.<eos> Help me defeat the Black Fairy.<eos> After we kill this thing, then what?<eos> Then we turn our sights to my mother.<eos> I thought she was trapped in another realm.<eos> That's where you come in.<eos> You're the Savior.<eos> Your magic is the only thing strong enough to not only slice into her realm, but to allow me to at last defeat her.<eos> So, you tried to kill me because you didn't believe that I would help you get to another realm to get back to her?

There's someone in another realm who can help us... a brave hero called The Savior.<eos> We just need to reach her, Gideon.<eos> How?<eos> I've heard rumors of a crystal ball... a magical orb that would allow us to communicate across the realms.<eos> If you'll help me.<eos> Over here.<eos> It's a dead end.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> !<eos> I already told you.

It's the only way.<eos> The spider... you brought it here.<eos> You knew you couldn't kill me on your own.<eos> Alas, you were far stronger than I anticipated.<eos> And while I created it, controlling it is a different matter.<eos> Which is why I must bid you farewell now, Savior.<eos> What about Hook?<eos> !<eos> I'm afraid, no matter what he tries, returning to this realm is impossible for him.<eos> I told you to walk away.
Mother.<eos> How did you know we were here?<eos> I led you here... just as I led your friend to my key.<eos> This whole thing... it was a test, wasn't it?<eos> From the moment you arrived, you were supposed to be different, Gideon.<eos> You were a gift... my loyal son.<eos> Gift?<eos> You stole me from my parents.<eos> They abandoned you!<eos> I'm the one who took you in, gave you a home, taught you, fed you, shared with you everything that I had!

And I know you're planning to do something terrible with it.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna let you.<eos> These people have suffered long enough.<eos> Have they?<eos> No, no, no, no, no!<eos> Stop!<eos> As far as I can see, this one's just begun to suffer.<eos> No!<eos> How dare you use that on me!<eos> I gave you this magic!
- Who?<eos> The worst of them.<eos> And they have no love for me or anyone.<eos> Keep up, old man!<eos> The shore is just through here!<eos> Oh, what the... ?<eos> This "old man" still has some spring in his step!<eos> Enjoy your stay, Captain!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> No way I help you... after all your double crosses.
I'm counting on it!<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll never look at Spider-Man again the same way, but I'm fine.<eos> Rumple, where's our boy?<eos> Gideon led Emma to the creature and left her to die.<eos> I thought you were helping him.<eos> I was, but Dark One Junior had different plans.<eos> He played me.<eos> He came to you for help, though.
The portal closed.<eos> You may not have killed her, but our dear spider came close enough.<eos> As her life ebbed away, the portal opened just enough to allowed dear old Mum to slip through.<eos> Oh, Gideon.<eos> Don't tell me you underestimated me.<eos> The spider was an ingenious stroke on my part, but you played yours to the hilt.<eos> I was under your thrall.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> True.<eos> But part of you wanted to help me, though, didn't it?

Sounds great.<eos> Um, I'll be right back.<eos> Is there a button I'm supposed to push or something?<eos> -Bitch, you got a Super Plus?<eos> Aunt Flo is in town, and she brought all her kids.<eos> Oh! Hey, Reg.<eos> What you doing here?<eos> Supposed to be a guest on this show, but Sam just left me hanging.<eos> She does that.<eos> Here, let me help you.
I'm really glad you did.<eos> I've been calling you.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I didn't really want to talk, but I heard your voice on the radio, and...<eos> Fuck, Sam.<eos> You did the right thing... the night of the party.<eos> It wasn't fair the way we treated you.<eos> I should have said something.<eos> White skin, light-skinned, but for me not the right skin.<eos> I have never... said "I love you" to... anyone before you.
-Kels. Right.<eos> I wanted to say thank you so much for my comfort dog.<eos> -Oh, you're welcome. -[laughs]<eos> Go on.<eos> That's all.<eos> Okay!<eos> Anybody with a question?<eos> Yes, you, sir.<eos> [crowd shouting] Can you feel this?<eos> Everyone here for you?
Was that worth all of this?<eos> What I hear Lionel saying is--<eos> There are 234 black undergrads on this campus.<eos> That's roughly $55 million, assuming we make it all four years.<eos> And yet you're willing to disregard our right to safe spaces?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The Hancocks!<eos> So, because I call it out, racism is my fault?<eos> Think about that night with Reggie.<eos> Everyone at that party-- hell, this whole campus-- has been on edge because of you.

With a B!<eos> [mouthing words] The truth is you like things to be fucked up so you have a machine to rage against, Sharpton.

I said, can you shut the fuck up?<eos> It's like nothing about our relationship has been easy.<eos> Who said it was supposed to be easy?<eos> No one.<eos> I just know it doesn't have to be this hard.<eos> -Listen, I just--<eos> -No, you listen.<eos> This is important to me.<eos> And if you want me on the Independent, these are the types of stories I'm gonna write.<eos> And if you don't like it, then you can just go fuck--
Absolutely not.<eos> Anyone sitting here?<eos> What a shitshow, huh?<eos> First few seasons were solid, then it just... went off the rails.<eos> I meant--<eos> Yeah, tonight.<eos> I'm trying to block it out.<eos> I think we all are.<eos> How did we end up pitted against each other?<eos> I always thought it was because of you.
Appreciate that.<eos> Remember, Murtaugh, we're all cops here.<eos> We're rooting for you on this case, so try not to take the outcome like you did your perfect game.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm-a give you three seconds to take that back and apologize.<eos> So start counting.<eos> One...<eos> Okay, here's the thing, if we're gonna get into a fight with police officers in a bowling alley... two... then there's one thing you've got to know.<eos> Hit first.<eos> Well, I am glad to hear that you are doing well over there, Avery.
I'm glad things are good for you at Sheriff's. Yes, they are.<eos> 12 years running now.<eos> You know, what happened out there in the desert with that ranger... real tragedy.<eos> It was.<eos> Some of your detectives have been sniffing around my department.<eos> I heard they had a run-in with some of my boys... off duty, no less.<eos> Just doing our jobs... looking into every avenue of investigation.<eos> I'm gonna be real clear here, Avery.<eos> If there's a problem in my house, I will handle it myself.<eos> Of course I would extend the same courtesy to you if the roles were reversed, you know that.
You don't look so good.<eos> Maybe that's because I just cut open the remains of a golden retriever named Thunder.<eos> Scorsese, you do it to humans all day long.<eos> Yeah, but humans are my comfort zone. Dogs... not so much.<eos> Anyway, the bullet that felled Thunder was the same caliber that killed the ranger, fired by the same Mini-14 assault rifle.<eos> Standard issue at Sheriff's until... two years ago.<eos> Time to get Thunder some justice.<eos> Trish.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you... for meeting me on such short notice.
I'm not worried, Roger.<eos> Okay?<eos> Get the door, honey.<eos> Hi, Roger.<eos> I would have thought it'd be Riggs.<eos> He usually spoils my evenings.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Let's go to my office.<eos> Roger and I need to talk.<eos> As your lawyer, I would strongly advise you against that.
Straight to voice mail.<eos> Bailey, need you to get a location on the captain<eos> I'm on it, just give me a few minutes.<eos> Looks like you started without me.<eos> Yeah, well.<eos> Why not, right?<eos> You know, it seems my request to back off fell on deaf ears.<eos> I tried to steer my guy away.<eos> But your man, Barton, didn't exactly cover his tracks very well.<eos> You were really okay with him killing the ranger?
It makes me sick.<eos> Scotch helps.<eos> And so should the knowledge that your career can continue.<eos> You know, not a day goes by that I don't regret what we did to Peter Scarelli.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I don't think about it at all.<eos> Yeah, go home and sleep it off, Avery.<eos> Tomorrow wake up and go to work.<eos> That's all any of us can do in this city.<eos> You were okay with him killing that ranger?
- What?<eos> Restaurant owners who serve food on a piece of wood.<eos> Erm, It's not very car-related, - is it, really?<eos> - No, it's not, but...<eos> Heston Blumenthal does that.<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> Exactly. Heston, if you're watching... prison.<eos> You, prison.<eos> food on a piece of wood.<eos> I tell you what I hate.
So, here's a quick sum-up.<eos> At the end of a seven-hour day, I've... been stuck 50-something times. Erm...<eos> And that wouldn't be so bad if I was gonna win a winch or a winch cover or a new piece of rope or something like that, but, in fact, in the rollover, we tore the punchcard off, which means, technically,<eos> But I've decided to go and drown myself instead.<eos> - I like Seamus a lot.<eos> - Yeah, I like him.<eos> - Seamus is my new best friend. - Yeah, definitely.<eos> - Ruined James May. - We need to do a lot more of those. - Yeah, a lot more.<eos> A lot more. - Many more.<eos> So, James, was there any aspect of that that you liked?
If you can brush them, you're gonna get maximum points.<eos> When I say "brush", I mean don't knock them over.<eos> If you can be within half a metre, you're gonna score high.<eos> I'd also score points for holding the car in as impressive a drift as possible.<eos> You've got to keep the throttle in so that you maintain the drift with good angle, and that's only up to you about how much steering input and how much accelerator you put in.<eos> The cars are designed to run at almost 90°.<eos> They've got massive amounts of steering angle, so you can drive on the end of your rack. OK.<eos> So I don't get awarded points for how quickly I do the whole thing?<eos> No, that doesn't come into it.<eos> It's all about angle, line, and how much you excite everybody.
Are you sure?<eos> Yes. Could you take over?<eos> You want me to cook?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Maybe it's time you learnt.<eos> Vilma!<eos> - He... Let him treat me.<eos> - I'll take over.<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> Vilma? What's happening to you?

We don't have that.<eos> - Maybe we should google it?<eos> - Google it? You want to get nicked?<eos> Goddamn fucking...!<eos> What the hell can I do?<eos> Marit's all alone.<eos> I've fucked up everything.<eos> You have to listen to me.<eos> Listen. Marit isn't stupid.<eos> As long as the cops and thugs keep asking about you, she knows you're alive.
I can't find it.<eos> It's extremely important that you don't lie to me now.<eos> - That you tell me all you know. - Yes.<eos> I think I've got everything I need.<eos> Thank you for your patience.<eos> What's your name?<eos> May I have your name?<eos> Right.<eos> You know, there's one last thing.<eos> You don't have to... I need your phone.
- I can explain.<eos> - Where are we?<eos> And who the hell is he?<eos> - Relax, he's not a cop.<eos> - Yes, I got that. She's kept quiet. - But it's a volatile situation.<eos> - Who's volatile, you sick fuck?<eos> - Don't talk to me.<eos> Talk to him.<eos> - Unn? Unn!<eos> I need to show you something.
- Emailing Marit, are you? - Of course not.<eos> I'm not stupid.<eos> - Then what is it?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - It's mine. - Show me!<eos> Don't break it.<eos> We have a deal based on trust.<eos> That's not what I'm feeling now.<eos> I've told you not to keep any secrets from me down here.<eos> You've screwed up. I can't trust you any more.

Eliminating or verifying each step.<eos> - Using these as test animals?<eos> - Plenty of rats down here.<eos> They eat all kinds of crap, so I get the best results when I find newborns.<eos> I've bred some of them. This one, for example.<eos> My work here gave me some answers, but I get lost working alone.<eos> I need a fresh view on everything.<eos> What'll you do if she wakes up?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - I need a word with you.

But even without her, I won't give up.<eos> Though sometimes I wish you could tell me what to do.<eos> I can't find space for a room for oxygen, propane and compressed air.<eos> I'm trying to work out whether to adjust it or start from scratch.<eos> The bonus is that I don't have to pay for infrastructure and so on. - But it'll be more expensive if...<eos> - But you don't have any money.<eos> I don't have to spend it all.<eos> Just what I need down here.<eos> We'll find a way.<eos> I'll help you.
There are a couple of things we have to agree on first.<eos> Vilma can stay here. No problem.<eos> Do as much research as you like.<eos> I don't care what you do, and you don't ask me what I'm doing.<eos> Agreed?<eos> I'll provide security as long as I'm 100% sure that you'll keep quiet.<eos> - This is extremely important to me.<eos> - OK.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> I only know you from what Ravn's told me.
Keith.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Keith.<eos> -[groaning] -Shiro, it's Keith.<eos> Keith.<eos> Keith, I'm here.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> [chuckles] Shiro, you made it.<eos> It takes more than a glowing alien wound, a fall from the upper atmosphere, and crashing into a hard pan surface, at what I'm guessing is about 25 meters per second squared, to get rid of me.<eos> -How are you?
Yeah! And it'll go ker-plooey!<eos> [Allura] It's not working!<eos> It's like we're shooting at ourselves.<eos> [Coran blows raspberry] Where's Voltron?<eos> -Shiro, what happened?<eos> -There's several creatures.<eos> [groaning] Keith, are you okay?<eos> What happened?<eos> [grunting] Minor delay, but I'm on my way.<eos> How are you?
Your Royalness-- [clears throat] if I may, this food is amazing.<eos> It's even better than Balmeran cave bugs.<eos> I'm glad you enjoy it.<eos> It was picked fresh from the Baku Garden.<eos> And I hope you enjoy the entertainment.<eos> So, about us getting in contact with our friends... how can you help us?<eos> Please, let's discuss that after the dance.<eos> Whoa, this dance is amazing.<eos> It's the... It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.<eos> I'm glad you enjoy it.
Please, let's discuss that after the dance.<eos> Whoa, this dance is amazing.<eos> It's the... It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.<eos> I'm glad you enjoy it.<eos> Put your mind at ease.<eos> Let your consciousness drift like the tide.<eos> Yes, I will do that.<eos> I...<eos> Were- - Weren't we just talking about something?<eos> You were just telling me how much you like it here, how much you wanted to stay forever.
Why am I blindfolded? Is this a game?<eos> I hate games!<eos> [grunts] It's okay.<eos> You were mind-swished, but now we want to--<eos> Kill me?<eos> Think again!<eos> -[grunts] -[screaming]<eos> Wait! Come back!<eos> [screaming] -Don't hurt me!<eos> -Please, we are not here to hurt you.
[Swirn] What do you remember from yesterday?<eos> I remember we crashed, saw the mermaids and the village, then we had dinner, and then, uh... we, uh...<eos> You can't remember because you were under her control.<eos> Our theory is, the queen controls minds by using her voice to strike certain head switches in your ear pan.<eos> And her magnetic stare locks on to your eye-to-brain pathway plug.<eos> Plus, her mind-control sonar is always broadcasting through the waters.<eos> Bong! She trains her people to use hypnotic movements to lull you under her control.<eos> I do remember a dancer.<eos> Good, because I haven't finished my picture for that one.<eos> But you see, she was infecting your brain!
Mer-science isn't always about getting the right answer.<eos> I want to thank you all for what you've done.<eos> You've freed my people, and I will do all I can to protect that freedom.<eos> I vow to be the voice of my people.<eos> I beg of you to help.<eos> -Will you be my advisors?<eos> -Of course, Your Highness.<eos> I have some great ideas.<eos> Have you ever heard of electricity?<eos> And I wanted to personally thank you, Lance.
We don't have much time.<eos> [Shiro groaning] [grunts] Wake up!<eos> Zarkon has located the Blue Lion of Voltron on your planet, Earth.<eos> You must get it before he does.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I've planted a bomb to cover your escape.<eos> Get to a pod, now. -Who are you?<eos> -I am Ulaz.<eos> Now, come on!<eos> Zarkon will know that I released you, so I must disappear.

-The Blade of Marmora is with you.<eos> -Why are you helping me?<eos> As a fighter and a leader, you give hope.<eos> Hurry! Earth needs you.<eos> We all do.<eos> You know I'm innocent!<eos> I would never betray Zarkon!<eos> You're weakening the empire!<eos> You misunderstand.<eos> I'm giving you the opportunity to serve the empire.

No.<eos> Right in front of it, in a hidden pocket of space-time.<eos> Coran, are you hearing this?<eos> I am picking up some kind of anomaly on the screen.<eos> I suppose it could be a cloaked base.<eos> Just fly straight for the center of the xanthorium cluster.<eos> You will see. You think you're going to get me to destroy our ship just because you say so?<eos> We came out here to find some answers.<eos> Are we going to turn back now?<eos> You know I trust you, Shiro, but this doesn't feel right.
No!<eos> Commander, we have to evacuate.<eos> The cube is down, and the Olkari have taken back the city.<eos> I want to thank you all.<eos> You helped us get our home back.<eos> And, for that, we will never be able to repay you.<eos> Just promise me that when it's time to take the fight to Zarkon, we can count on the Olkari for help.<eos> Now and forever.<eos> And you...<eos> The spirit of the Olkari resides in you.
Still working on the worm-- [screams] [groans, screams]<eos> The turbine's up.<eos> Uh, guys, I think I'm realizing now that I do, in fact, have a case of the slipperies.<eos> I'm sorry I yelled at you, Pidge.<eos> I may need your help, after all.<eos> -I'm coming down.<eos> -[Shiro] Let's clear a path.<eos> [Keith] Lance, there's a fighter advancing on your nine!<eos> Thanks for the heads-up!<eos> And you've got one going for the lower barrier.
And you've got one going for the lower barrier.<eos> [Keith] Good eye!<eos> What can I do?<eos> Help me divert power.<eos> Slide me to that monitor!<eos> -Wipe my sweat! -[grunting]<eos> Okay, buddy, you're mine.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I lost control of my defense drone!<eos> I got you covered!
[Keith] Good eye!<eos> What can I do?<eos> Help me divert power.<eos> Slide me to that monitor!<eos> -Wipe my sweat! -[grunting]<eos> Okay, buddy, you're mine.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I lost control of my defense drone!<eos> I got you covered!<eos> Uh, I don't got you.
Nope.<eos> No, I- - I think the next layer is acid.<eos> The plan was to evacuate the population to our nearest moon, where we have built a colony to wait out the shedding process.<eos> So we relocated to higher ground and constructed that ark.<eos> [Lance] What happened?<eos> [Baujal] The Galra attacked, led by a vile commander named Morvok.<eos> He robbed us of vital resources and left us with only one operational engine, stranding us here.<eos> You're not stranded anymore.<eos> We will save your people.<eos> I believe you, for I have heard many legends of the valor of Voltron.
We're almost there.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> [Lance] You got it.<eos> [Pidge] Anytime.<eos> [Shiro] All right, Hunk, time to work on those engines.<eos> [Keith] So, what happens if Zarkon does come after us?<eos> You said you could pilot us to safety, right?<eos> Sure, but after that, could we even go back to the group?<eos> And if we don't, who would pilot the Castle or create wormholes?<eos> Well, what about you?
Lance!<eos> Pidge!<eos> Attack the ship with your jaw blades!<eos> [Keith] We'll never get there at this rate.<eos> This was a terrible mistake.<eos> Shiro was right.<eos> We never should have left them.<eos> Rocks!<eos> Big, big rocks!<eos> [Lance] We got you, buddy.
[low growl] [beeping]<eos> Sir, the ion cannon's guidance system is back online.<eos> And the lions appear to have gathered beneath the ark.<eos> Perfect!<eos> The lions will go down with it.<eos> Fire when ready!<eos> -[cheering] -All right!<eos> Good to have you back, Keith.<eos> Good to be back.<eos> -Is the Princess with you?

Well, while you're working on that... the rest of us need to find some new teludav lenses... otherwise we won't be able to travel via wormhole.<eos> -Is that something we have to mail order?<eos> -Does anyone even make those anymore?<eos> [Allura] I don't know.<eos> Only a few Alteans could use the teludav 10,000 ago.<eos> They may not exist anymore.<eos> I think I may know where we can get some.<eos> Coran!<eos> You're not suggesting going to one of those filthy swap moons!<eos> The last time you went, those space pirates took you for everything you had.
Fine!<eos> What do you got?<eos> Have you ever come across something like this?<eos> Whoa, this craftsmanship is incredible!<eos> And is this a luxite blade?<eos> The planet they mine that from hasn't existed in decafebes.<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> Someone gave it to me.<eos> Okay, that's vague. Tell you what...<eos> I'll give you 1,000 GAC to take it off your hands.
Does this look over medium to you?<eos> No, Chef.<eos> Then let's get it right, huh?<eos> If it ain't perfect, it ain't coming out of this kitchen, people!<eos> Sauce me!<eos> Now you're getting it!<eos> -Bon appétit. -[applause]<eos> I got you now, pirate!<eos> Where are your friends?<eos> [screaming] Don't forget what I taught you! Those are the fundamentals of cooking!
So, yes, it'll be Keith.<eos> [Coran] The course to the base will be quite treacherous, to say the least.<eos> You're walking a razor's edge between the gravitational pull of the black holes and the sun.<eos> One false move, and you'll either be crushed into infinity or burnt to a crisp.<eos> -Keith, is everything okay?<eos> -I'm fine.<eos> You kind of blew up at everybody back there.<eos> You'll have to control your emotions if you're going to lead this group someday.<eos> [chuckles] Lead the group?<eos> When we were stranded, I told you, if anything ever happens to me, I want you to lead Voltron.
-I'm fine.<eos> You kind of blew up at everybody back there.<eos> You'll have to control your emotions if you're going to lead this group someday.<eos> [chuckles] Lead the group?<eos> When we were stranded, I told you, if anything ever happens to me, I want you to lead Voltron.<eos> I thought you were just delirious with pain.<eos> Why would you make me the leader?<eos> Because I know what you're capable of, if you can learn some self-discipline.<eos> Why are we even talking about this?<eos> Nothing is gonna happen to you.
I've just had a lot on my mind.<eos> I know.<eos> We all have.<eos> -[grunts] -[alarm blaring] [Keith] We're getting drawn in by one of the black holes!<eos> Get us out of here!<eos> Great job!<eos> That was close.<eos> There's nothing here.<eos> This place just looks like a plain asteroid.<eos> I am going to ask you some questions.
Can't wait.<eos> These trials result in one of two things.<eos> Knowledge or death.<eos> Surrender the blade.<eos> You cannot win.<eos> Come on, Keith.<eos> [grunts, groans] Surrender the blade and the pain will cease.<eos> I won't quit.<eos> Then the pain continues.<eos> You are not meant to go through that door.
Come on, Keith.<eos> [grunts, groans] Surrender the blade and the pain will cease.<eos> I won't quit.<eos> Then the pain continues.<eos> You are not meant to go through that door.<eos> This is not a fair fight!<eos> Nor is taking on the Galra, yet that is the fight we face.<eos> Surrender the blade and the pain will cease.<eos> Never!<eos> You are not meant to go through that door.
Shiro?<eos> [grunting] Kolivan told me you lasted longer than anyone ever has in those battles.<eos> -You don't have to keep this up.<eos> -What are you talking about?<eos> Just give them the knife and let's get out of here.<eos> I can't give it to them, Shiro.<eos> Is that a hologram?<eos> His suit has the ability to create a virtual mindscape, reflecting its wearer's greatest hopes and fears.<eos> And, at this moment, your friend desperately wants to see you.<eos> What is it with you and that thing?
Shiro!<eos> Wait!<eos> Huh... [man] Keith... [gasps] Dad?<eos> You're home, son.<eos> -[loud rumbling] -What's going on outside?<eos> Don't worry about that. We'll be fine as long as we stay in here.<eos> Don't you want to catch up?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> [sighs] Son, so many years have passed.<eos> - I have so much to tell you.
-You need to get him out of there.<eos> -He can decide when to leave.<eos> You're messing with his mind. You're going to kill him!<eos> Knowledge or death, Shiro.<eos> I'm calling this off.<eos> You gotta tell me, Dad.<eos> I have to know.<eos> Where did the knife come from?<eos> What does it mean? Your mother is almost here.<eos> She'll tell you everything.
What does it mean? Your mother is almost here.<eos> She'll tell you everything.<eos> I can't wait around anymore.<eos> I have to go.<eos> If you go out that door, you'll never find out who you are.<eos> Goodbye, Dad.<eos> -The Red Lion is moving!<eos> -We gotta get down there!<eos> [Hunk] It won't be ready for five more minutes.<eos> I am going to ask you some questions.
Goodbye, Dad.<eos> -The Red Lion is moving!<eos> -We gotta get down there!<eos> [Hunk] It won't be ready for five more minutes.<eos> I am going to ask you some questions.<eos> I will know if you lie.<eos> I have reason to believe that a spy has infiltrated Galra command.<eos> That is very alarming.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Are you aware of any spies within our ranks?
-Everyone, stay focused.<eos> -Keith, are you okay?<eos> -Stop what you're doing!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What's going on?<eos> -Call off your beast!<eos> -Move out of the way!<eos> We're leaving!<eos> You're not leaving with that blade.<eos> It does not belong to you.
Go into a belly of a beast with the only Galra alien team member.<eos> I'm not an alien.<eos> Well, you're kind of an alien.<eos> You're way more alien than me. You're at least some alien.<eos> I'm-I'm none alien.<eos> [sighs] Let's just concentrate on the job here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Was-Was your mom the alien?<eos> Your grandpa?<eos> How Galra are you?
Well, you're kind of an alien.<eos> You're way more alien than me. You're at least some alien.<eos> I'm-I'm none alien.<eos> [sighs] Let's just concentrate on the job here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Was-Was your mom the alien?<eos> Your grandpa?<eos> How Galra are you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did the Blade of Marmora, like, teach you the secret handshake, or something?
You're not going anywhere.<eos> And neither is the lion.<eos> -[both scream] -[growling] [both scream] [panting] [grunts] [groans] See what I was saying about those robot arms?<eos> Lance! No!<eos> [screaming] [screaming] -No!<eos> -Wait, I got this.<eos> Come on... [takes deep breath]<eos> Nice, Lance!<eos> That's why we bring our sharpshooter.<eos> At least, you're okay.
Nice, Lance!<eos> That's why we bring our sharpshooter.<eos> At least, you're okay.<eos> That's a good girl.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Who's a good little yupper?<eos> Who's the good little yupper?<eos> The information I found on my brother says he was taken by a group of rebels.<eos> He's still out there.<eos> Matt's a lot like you.
How did we beat it last time?<eos> We formed Voltron, then I stuck in my Bayard and shot it with my blaster right in its arm lasers.<eos> But that didn't stop it so then we had to punch it.<eos> - So we're gonna need Voltron.<eos> - But we only have two lions.<eos> Well, maybe we can form the legs and kick it?<eos> That new laser is much more powerful.<eos> We're definitely gonna need all the lions.<eos> Hunk, you distract it so we can fly into the castle.<eos> Once we get our lions out, we'll cover you so you can fly Keith in for Red.
- And don't forget that cool cube thing.<eos> - Yeah, and that awful cube thing.<eos> You realize once we defeat Zarkon, the universe won't need Voltron anymore.<eos> - We can return to Earth.<eos> - I can look for my family.<eos> I guess I could look for mine.<eos> This is it.<eos> As long as everything goes according to plan, we can't fail.<eos> No more questions.<eos> I'll get the truth out of you one way or another.
Put this on.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Just put it on.<eos> So this is where we are.<eos> Downtown Oslo.<eos> An interesting place.<eos> It's a nice view from here.<eos> Nobody must recognise you.<eos> No one will see me up here.<eos> You can come here from time to time, when I've said it's OK, provided you wear this suit.
- How many are there? - There are 50,000 bees in there.<eos> 50,000?<eos> Each with their own task and a common goal: preserving the colony.<eos> Look at that one sitting there.<eos> Now they're all leaving.<eos> They're just off to work.<eos> They'll be back.<eos> They know where home is.<eos> I wish that you...<eos> That I could talk to you.
You need to release your tensions here.<eos> And in your breath.<eos> Grethe, have you ever lost a boyfriend or husband?<eos> - No, I haven't.<eos> - Grief is not muscle tension.<eos> My mother always said that grief is the price of love.<eos> Your stepdaughter came by.<eos> - Siv?<eos> - She wanted to talk about Vilma.<eos> Asked about you as well.
- How about if I take over?<eos> - You wouldn't know what to do. This is far more dangerous than what you've outlined.<eos> Let go...<eos> What will you do if I don't wake up?<eos> How will you handle Siv?<eos> Ravn?<eos> Ravn...<eos> Hi. You have to wake up. Hey, Ravn.<eos> Wake up!<eos> Get up, I need to talk to you.
Sadly I have a lot of extra work and night shifts in my new job, but I'll see you soon.<eos> I'm looking forward to it.<eos> Train 5 to Vestli...<eos> Stand clear of the doors.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - What is your name?<eos> - Aisha.<eos> Aisha, I'm afraid you're going to have to remove that.<eos> - What can we do for you?
Transport, consultation and operation, then.<eos> That's 50,000.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - All right.<eos> A word. - She doesn't have to pay that much.<eos> - Why not?<eos> We can afford to help her pro bono.<eos> - Positive discrimination, is it? - Come on, Leif.<eos> - The authorities will throw her out...<eos> - Exactly! You're wanted, Aisha.
And where will you find such a lab animal?<eos> I have a plan.<eos> - Will you help me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Siv?<eos> Hi. Glad you finally came by.<eos> I've been very busy at work. Well?<eos> What's this about?<eos> Let's grab a coffee.<eos> I want to talk to you.
I've got employees.<eos> I create something.<eos> Unlike you, I actually contribute! Is that why you wanted me to work here?<eos> To keep the secret in the family?<eos> One call from me, and you'll get shut down.<eos> All right, Leif.<eos> You win. You're the strongest.<eos> Make your call.<eos> Do what you always do, ruin everything for the ones who love you.<eos> I'm done trying to help you.
Not at all?<eos> You understood that, though.<eos> Stop!<eos> It is gone.<eos> Your breast is gone, yes.<eos> But so is the cancer, we believe. It will look better once the swelling goes down.<eos> I am going to live.<eos> Thank you so much!<eos> I... can't find your clothes.<eos> I just want to talk to you!

It will look better once the swelling goes down.<eos> I am going to live.<eos> Thank you so much!<eos> I... can't find your clothes.<eos> I just want to talk to you!<eos> Done. On to the kettlebell!<eos> A heavy one.<eos> Lift, then drop.<eos> Move over, I'll show you.
Lasse?<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Easy, easy...<eos> Lasse!<eos> Aisha managed 3,000 more.<eos> She insisted on paying.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> - It's fine?<eos> Yes. She doesn't have to pay anything.<eos> What happened to you?
So do the police.<eos> I'm going to have a son.<eos> In 3 weeks.<eos> I'll turn myself in if you want me to.<eos> I won't say a word.<eos> All that matters is that they are OK.<eos> How's your shelter coming along?<eos> It's getting there.<eos> The fuses keep blowing, though.<eos> I'll see if I can set you up with a new fuse box.
Demanding that we answer that very question.<eos> What kind of society do we want to be?<eos> She was precocious, nosy, opinionated.<eos> Oh, my gosh, she was bubbly and outgoing.<eos> She always wanted to be in the mix of everything.<eos> What I love most about my daughter is she has a big heart.<eos> I am Jane Doe.<eos> I would say to my 12-year-old self,<eos> "Don't settle for less because you're a whole lot more than that.<eos> I promise you."
And even sightings of extraterrestrial beings on the ground.<eos> That they want them discredited.<eos> They want their credibility destroyed.<eos> If someone comes out and says,<eos> I saw a UFO on TV.<eos> The only ones who see a UFO on TV programs are the rednecks. Out in the country that, uh...<eos> That are going coon hunting or alligator hunting at night.<eos> You don't find anybody with any kind of smarts or...<eos> Or some professional individual saying,<eos> "Hey, last night, let me tell you about something, so..."
To be honest, this may be a little bit my fault.<eos> [Dunleavy] Ms. Chalker mentioned that.<eos> She also mentioned that you stole her boyfriend.<eos> I didn't steal him.<eos> He was made of cans, and I had the magnet.<eos> [Jacqueline laughs] Oh, you caught me mid-laugh.<eos> Jacqueline.<eos> I want to steal your youth.<eos> Oh... Breathe into my mouth.<eos> [Duke] I can see Russ finally got around to buying you a wedding band.
[Yermuther] Ma'am, that bit doesn't work without some kind of partition.<eos> What do you want, Kimmy?<eos> I'm kind of in the middle of something.<eos> Yeah, what's going on?<eos> The FBI is out there, and they have guns, and there's a dog with a badge.<eos> Why didn't I pet him? I was right there.<eos> He looked at me.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh! I'm just doing what you told me to do.<eos> Okay, I get that you want to blame me, but I didn't tell you to do this.
I want it because Russ has it.<eos> How could Meemaw give it to him instead of me?<eos> How could anyone give anything to him instead of me?<eos> He's a loser, Jacqueline.<eos> I mean, I'm sorry, but has he ever beaten you at sex?<eos> I win every time. I'm the fastest.<eos> But if Meemaw loved Russ more than me, what does that make me, hmm?<eos> Worse than Russ?<eos> So, like... two Russes?<eos> I'm sorry, Duke, but I can't give you the recipe, even if it means you hate me, even if the whole family turns its back on me so I'm just looking at butts.

I mean, you've got... boats.<eos> And you know a lot about watches.<eos> [Gretchen] It's like I'm talking, but she's not listening.<eos> Gretchen, we have to talk.<eos> This must be Kimmy.<eos> Look, you were right.<eos> That cats are just baby dogs?<eos> That this didn't work out because you're a woman, because the world won't let you do it like a man.<eos> See, it's not your fault that boys don't learn how to cook or that people are obsessed with how women look.<eos> I mean, have you seen what they did to Strawberry Shortcake?
Every choice we make today has consequences.<eos> The balcony will be scrutinized by the press, the people, the powers that be.<eos> Even a sideways glance may be misconstrued.<eos> - Or construed.<eos> - Precisely. So, let's make certain Cyrus is relegated, and you, my darling, are front and center up there.<eos> Though you haven't been officially crowned, it will signal that you are clearly king.<eos> And what will Uncle Cyrus have to say about that?<eos> I'd throw him off the balcony if I could.<eos> But in lieu of that, perhaps he would be gracious enough to be ill and stay in bed.<eos> Look, I know how much today means to you, but Cyrus will insist on being there and like you said we can't be seen jostling for position in public.

He wishes you a speedy recovery.<eos> You are so lucky.<eos> I... I used to drive that highway every weekend... to visit my brother and his kids... and I saw an accident almost every single time.<eos> People die on that road all the time.<eos> I... I already rescheduled everything you had this week.<eos> But I didn't touch that meeting with the regulator.<eos> I know that whole Utah timeline is delicate.<eos> - All right.<eos> It's next Wednesday, right? - Yes.<eos> There's a lot of prep that we pushed... so you could focus on getting Mr. Gatwood up by the end of the quarter.

Kim?<eos> You okay?<eos> I can always come back.<eos> I'm gonna need you to cancel Gatwood and push everything else.<eos> - What?<eos> Everything?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Everything.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - But first, could you give me a ride?
We don't have to understand each other.<eos> Things are fine the way they are.<eos> I don't want to hurt your feelings... but the truth is you've never mattered all that much to me.<eos> Gold comforter.<eos> Green chair.<eos> Brown journal.<eos> Jimmy.<eos> What a nice surprise.<eos> Irene, as beautiful as ever.<eos> Why don't you come in?
Oh, I don't want to be a bother.<eos> - I just have a couple things to drop off.<eos> - Well... What is all this?<eos> Well, when we win, we celebrate.<eos> That's very sweet.<eos> Yes, and I didn't forget about Oscar and Felix.<eos> I've got some kitty toys and catnip in there for those two little rascals. Oh.<eos> - You shouldn't have, Jimmy.<eos> - Of course I should.<eos> Now, have you given any thought... to how you wanna spend that settlement money?
- You shouldn't have, Jimmy.<eos> - Of course I should.<eos> Now, have you given any thought... to how you wanna spend that settlement money?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can tell you what I'd do.<eos> Alaskan cruise.<eos> You can walk on a glacier under the Aurora Borealis.<eos> And if Alaska's too cold, maybe a European river cruise.<eos> Float on down the Danube.<eos> You and the ladies could split a deluxe suite.
Oh, it's just not the same, Jimmy.<eos> She showed her true colors.<eos> When it came to that settlement, we were the furthest things from her mind.<eos> It just took her a bit to realize what was important to you.<eos> She came around.<eos> She just wanted to get back on our good side.<eos> Okay, how do you trust someone who bends any way the wind is blowing?<eos> Where is her integrity?<eos> Well, I can't help but blame myself.<eos> - You were just trying to help.

Look, if you wanna blame someone... you should blame me.<eos> Jimmy, you're a good friend.<eos> She doesn't deserve you.<eos> No, she doesn't.<eos> Yes, I've shut off all the breakers.<eos> Yes, I have checked.<eos> Several times.<eos> The power meter is still turning.<eos> I think there's something in the house that isn't wired through the breaker box... and it's drawing power.<eos> Well, I want you to send someone over to find it and disconnect it.

- You have to calm down.<eos> That hacienda!<eos> I paid for it.<eos> And you treat us like dogs.<eos> Hector, this isn't personal.<eos> It is!<eos> It is personal!<eos> Call 911.<eos> Stash the guns.<eos> You should not be here when they arrive.
My boss collapsed.<eos> I think he's having a heart attack.<eos> Come on.<eos> Be advised, we have one adult male....<eos> Does he have a history of cardiac issues?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And was he taking any medications?<eos> He took these.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We're headed to Lovelace if you'd like to follow.
No. Shit, that bridge is burned.<eos> Ashes.<eos> It's that bad?<eos> There's no putting that genie back in the bottle.<eos> And I've tried everything.<eos> I sent muffin baskets to the gals.<eos> - I signed them from her.<eos> - Nice.<eos> They saw right through it.<eos> "Oh, Jimmy, you're too nice.
And then cow.<eos> Sit up straight. Very good, Jasper.<eos> Cat.<eos> And cow.<eos> Long, deep breaths.<eos> Breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth.<eos> And cow.<eos> And cat....<eos> Erin Brill!<eos> You're just in time for chair yoga.
And cow.<eos> And cat....<eos> Erin Brill!<eos> You're just in time for chair yoga.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Well, pull up a chair.<eos> There's always room for one more.<eos> Now, Mr. McGill.<eos> - What?<eos> - You are unbelievable.
You're just in time for chair yoga.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Well, pull up a chair.<eos> There's always room for one more.<eos> Now, Mr. McGill.<eos> - What?<eos> - You are unbelievable.<eos> I could not for the life of me figure out why Mrs. Landry... would suddenly change her mind about the Sandpiper settlement.<eos> I had to drag the information out.<eos> You filled her and all of her friends' heads with lies.

Hey, everyone.<eos> Apologies.<eos> That was probably more like 20 breaths instead of 10...<eos> I don't see a lot of forward folding going on.<eos> Come on, girls.<eos> Shame on you.<eos> So?<eos> - Like a charm. Yeah.<eos> - She'll go back on the settlement?<eos> I imagine you'll hear from her within an hour or so.
- Like a charm. Yeah.<eos> - She'll go back on the settlement?<eos> I imagine you'll hear from her within an hour or so.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Well done in there.<eos> I meant every word I said.<eos> I know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - You got the address?
Hey.<eos> You guys about done?<eos> Yep.<eos> Listen, I....<eos> I'm real sorry that this didn't work out.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I already talked to my old supervisor.<eos> Looks like they can take me back, so....<eos> Oh, that's great.<eos> And, you know, if we ever get another office up... you'd be our first call.
Coming right up...<eos> It's like they think we're oblivious.<eos> Hey, how's your morning going?<eos> Good, thanks.<eos> - Americano.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I know it was a very traumatic breakup for her, but I'm nervous.<eos> I read that women over 35 are 53% more likely to end up alone.<eos> - I read that in the Sunday Times.<eos> - Hmm. Have you heard about that?
I read that women over 35 are 53% more likely to end up alone.<eos> - I read that in the Sunday Times.<eos> - Hmm. Have you heard about that?<eos> Claire, you can't blame yourself for your daughter's breakup.<eos> Rebecca's relationship is her responsibility, her choice.<eos> I thought of signing her up with OkCupid.<eos> Isn't that what they call it?<eos> But it's not your decision.<eos> For all you know, Rebecca might already be on OkCupid or dating.<eos> See, if you keep trying to control her, she's gonna keep pushing you away.

See, if you keep trying to control her, she's gonna keep pushing you away.<eos> You know what I'm gonna say.<eos> Yeah, I know, boundaries.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> But, you know, I'm worried.<eos> I can't help it.<eos> She works all the time, and she does not date.<eos> And soon she's gonna be old, and then what's gonna happen to her?<eos> Our goal in this room is to focus on you.<eos> And for now, you just need to carve out some time and figure out what it is that you need to be happy.

I cannot let go.<eos> It's a process.<eos> Hey, Sam.<eos> Come on in.<eos> It's not just that.<eos> I don't know, I keep hearing her voice in my head.<eos> I wish it would stop, but, um...<eos> Sam, it's okay to be emotional.<eos> It's been eight months.<eos> You must think I'm such a loser.
I don't judge, and who cares what I think, anyway?<eos> She made things exciting.<eos> Whatever you were doing, she made you feel like you're part of the best thing in the world.<eos> It could be buying groceries.<eos> It didn't matter.<eos> I never was adventurous, but she made me feel like I was.<eos> And now, it's like this thing was taken from me, and I feel worthless.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> You just need to give it some time.

I do not bullshit you, my friend.<eos> Hey, my next appointment isn't till four.<eos> I need a Brazilian.<eos> Want to head uptown?<eos> Oh, 'cause that's so fun?<eos> I have a two o'clock. I should head back, especially after this morning.<eos> Where'd that rebellious spirit go, Jeanie?<eos> Your office is so corporate.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You think you'd want to make it, like, warm or something.

First just, like, Adderall, you know?<eos> Shit to help me concentrate.<eos> And then some other stuff.<eos> Anyway, the point is that shit's expensive, like, real pricey.<eos> And my mom works really hard to make tuition.<eos> She's a receptionist at this healthcare place, and I don't qualify for financial aid 'cause my dad has problems with the IRS.<eos> Just another fucked up story from a dysfunctional girl.<eos> Anyway, so I stole a check and used it for drugs.<eos> And what happened?<eos> What do you think happened?
What do you think happened?<eos> I had to drop out.<eos> And now I don't know what to do.<eos> Have you told your mom?<eos> That's the thing, I can't.<eos> 'Cause as if this isn't a fucking nightmare as it is, my mom just got the results of a CT scan, and it turns out she has lung cancer.<eos> So, no, I'm just the biggest disappointment, and that's how she'll remember me.<eos> I'm really sorry to hear that.<eos> Why?<eos> You just met me.

I'm really sorry to hear that.<eos> Why?<eos> You just met me.<eos> Can I ask... what made you keep going with the drugs?<eos> It's the fucking high, man.<eos> It's like without it, shit's just gray, you know?<eos> It's like you never felt a single fucking thing walking around this place until it goes through your body.<eos> And I would do it all over again, knowing everything, too.<eos> It was just beyond my control.<eos> You ever felt like that?

Thanks.<eos> Name for the order?<eos> Diane.<eos> - This isn't...<eos> - It's better, trust me.<eos> You know this band?<eos> Yeah, it's mine.<eos> We play a show every Friday.<eos> Cool.<eos> Have you always been into coffee?
- This isn't...<eos> - It's better, trust me.<eos> You know this band?<eos> Yeah, it's mine.<eos> We play a show every Friday.<eos> Cool.<eos> Have you always been into coffee?<eos> It's a job.<eos> Yeah, makes sense.<eos> You, you must have some kind of serious job, huh?
Good.<eos> 'Cause you are definitely my type.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Mm-hmm. What are you gonna do about it?<eos> Watch out.<eos> - Good?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Bye, sweetie.<eos> Hey, want to go play Fruit Ninja?<eos> Oh, hi, I was wondering, do you have Chance by Chanel?
Yes. We also carry Chanel No.5, or our new...<eos> Just that one, thanks.<eos> Hey, honey, I just bought you the cutest little...<eos> It's Alexis.<eos> Oh, sorry, Alexis.<eos> I was just shopping for ties.<eos> Yeah, Dolly's school called.<eos> - Is everything all right?<eos> - Oh, yes, yes, sorry.<eos> You should start with that, okay?
- Here, I got you.<eos> I got it.<eos> I got it, thank you.<eos> Dude, offer to pay for her dry cleaning.<eos> - Oh, yeah, okay.<eos> - No, don't worry.<eos> It's fine, I'm leaving.<eos> You lost?<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> You came after all.
Nice to meet you, too.<eos> Great job.<eos> Thanks, man...<eos> Miss.<eos> All right, ladies, I'm gonna go find Paige.<eos> Have fun.<eos> - You want?<eos> - I shouldn't.<eos> I won't tell anyone.<eos> You are persuasive.
Thanks, man...<eos> Miss.<eos> All right, ladies, I'm gonna go find Paige.<eos> Have fun.<eos> - You want?<eos> - I shouldn't.<eos> I won't tell anyone.<eos> You are persuasive.<eos> - So, you liked the show? - Yeah.<eos> You have a real presence.
You have a real presence.<eos> It's rare.<eos> So, is he your boyfriend?<eos> - Frances?<eos> - Hmm. No.<eos> I don't really do that anymore.<eos> - Do what?<eos> - Relationships.<eos> Well, serious ones.<eos> Wow, you must have really gotten burnt.
- Hmm. No.<eos> I don't really do that anymore.<eos> - Do what?<eos> - Relationships.<eos> Well, serious ones.<eos> Wow, you must have really gotten burnt.<eos> No, actually, I was just in a messy situation.<eos> What was the situation?<eos> It's really not worth going into.<eos> No, I want to know what kind of person you would be with.
Tell me how he'd, like, kill himself if I left, all this bullshit.<eos> - Was he serious?<eos> - I mean, yeah.<eos> Getting out a knife, saying he'd slit his wrists.<eos> Like, do you think that makes someone want to stay with you?<eos> When you have nothing of your own?<eos> Let's get a drink.<eos> - What, now?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Or are you busy or something?

I understood then the key to happiness.<eos> And what's that?<eos> Active denial.<eos> I looked at that thing, and... and I didn't see it as real.<eos> It was this one thing that happened, and I went about my day, pretending all was cool.<eos> What happened to your dad?<eos> Supposedly in prison.<eos> I mean, I haven't seen him in ages, and I don't ever think about him, which I count to be my Christmas gift every year.<eos> But what about you?<eos> Tell me what you write about.
So?<eos> What's the rush?<eos> Work.<eos> Deadlines.<eos> Well, that sucks.<eos> I really like talking to you.<eos> - Who's this?<eos> - Uh, that's my niece, my sister's kid.<eos> - She's adorable.<eos> - You know, you smell like me.
- She's adorable.<eos> - You know, you smell like me.<eos> Chance, Chanel?<eos> It's just a gift box.<eos> I can't explain it, but... there's something about you that reminds me of me.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Good morning.<eos> - Good morning, Alexis.<eos> - Alan called, he wants to see you.
She barely answers her phone.<eos> So this weekend, when she canceled, I blew up!<eos> Why do you think she's avoiding me?<eos> It's impossible for me to speculate on Rebecca's life.<eos> I only have access to you.<eos> I think she's just busy.<eos> If she were dating, that would be a good enough reason.<eos> I used to hope that she wasn't picking up because she was having sex.<eos> That would be fine by me, you know?<eos> I understand your concern, but by giving her space, you might show her that you're respecting her boundaries.
You seem okay.<eos> Yeah, it was, it was fine.<eos> We talked for a few minutes, caught up.<eos> She told me a little bit about her show the other night.<eos> What did she say?<eos> Not much, just how excited she was.<eos> How she wished I could have seen it.<eos> I used to love seeing her perform.<eos> I always felt like, even if it was a full house, like... like I was the only one in the audience.<eos> You know, I was thinking, Sam, is it possible that you came on too strong with Sidney?

I didn't force her to stay.<eos> We were in love, and then she got scared.<eos> Decided she needed to experience more shit.<eos> More people.<eos> So she's dating?<eos> No, she actually told me she's not interested in any guys.<eos> So she's interested in women?<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> Well, the way you...
Come on, Barbie.<eos> Don't quit on me now.<eos> Come on.<eos> We need help, or a phone.<eos> Or if anyone's a doctor, that'd be really clutch right about now.<eos> Welcome to Tasty Dragon.<eos> Table for two?<eos> No, ma'am, we need a doctor.<eos> We can stitch him up.<eos> But you have to order something first.

Hey.<eos> You still with me, handsome?<eos> You're not gonna leave me alone, are you?<eos> Probably not.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Follow me.<eos> Sencha green tea.<eos> Calms the nerves.<eos> Lady, quit the Ching-chong bullshit.<eos> Could you be 10% less Chinese for a second and help me stitch up my friend?
Follow me.<eos> Sencha green tea.<eos> Calms the nerves.<eos> Lady, quit the Ching-chong bullshit.<eos> Could you be 10% less Chinese for a second and help me stitch up my friend?<eos> Well, that's not offensive at all.<eos> You white people come in here... expecting a show, a mystic experience of the East, and "Ching-chong bullshit" rakes in the tips.<eos> Well, maybe I'd be more sensitive if my friend weren't bleeding to death.<eos> We should have never come here.<eos> You could drive for miles in every direction and your friend will be dead before you get anywhere.

You're my hero.<eos> Yeah, well... it was no big deal.<eos> Especially since I didn't take it for you.<eos> Jessica!<eos> My pet fish from when I was a kid!<eos> Memories, emotions, phobias...<eos> that sort of thing.<eos> Inside one of these memories is the key to get you out.<eos> Look what I found!<eos> You're quite the fighter.

Your joint's the only thing standing in this godforsaken desert.<eos> Which doesn't make any sense because we're by the Scar, and nothing's supposed to work here.<eos> I provide a sacred space for travelers to find their path.<eos> Your friend and his demons are here to make things right.<eos> Just like everyone else who comes here.<eos> Yeah?<eos> How many of them get happy endings?<eos> Most.<eos> But not all.<eos> Those the herbs you're using on Arthur?

Why not just create a dreamworld for yourself where your daughter's still alive?<eos> Doesn't work that way.<eos> There are limits.<eos> The Scar likes things done a certain way.<eos> How can the Scar like anything?<eos> It's just a crack in the earth.<eos> I'm sorry, there's just too many bone fragments.<eos> - What?<eos> - I can't get them all out.<eos> You should prepare to say good-bye.

No-no-no-no-no-I...<eos> I only fucked her so my head wouldn't explode!<eos> That's what they all say!<eos> You would have done the same thing if you were there!<eos> Excuse me, I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt this beautiful "broment," but there's so much pain and suffering to do and so little time to do it.<eos> - No... - I'm happy we're doing this<eos> - together. - No.<eos> Christopher, no.<eos> Because the only thing better than being inside of you, is knowing I get to eat you afterword.<eos> It's not the first time you did this, is it?
No.<eos> I did it once before.<eos> On my daughter, Aki.<eos> I can only imagine how much she meant to you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thank you for helping us.<eos> Is this some kind of a joke?<eos> Like I said, your friend isn't the only one on a quest.<eos> Enough of the mystical bullshit.<eos> How do you have this?

Nice and easy.<eos> No sudden moves.<eos> Come on, kid, what the hell are you doing?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You one of those demos?<eos> Demo what?<eos> What color do you bleed?<eos> You make one more move, and I will blow the wires right out of your head.<eos> Who sent you?<eos> Are you fucking crazy, man?
Jesus...<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What do I do?<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> I got killed by a Backstreet Boy.<eos> Who?<eos> You're not gonna die, man.

I can't... I can't stop the bleeding.<eos> It's too much.<eos> - Relax, kid. - Oh, fuck.<eos> You're not the one who's dying.<eos> But it was my fault.<eos> Can't argue with that.<eos> Kid, you want to make this right?<eos> Here.<eos> Take this.<eos> Are you... you want me... you want me to give this to somebody?
Nobody'd ever believed me.<eos> There's somebody behind all of this crazy shit that I was talking about before.<eos> But I just don't know who.<eos> But everything I do know is in that book.<eos> I don't expect you to believe it.<eos> Didn't believe it myself when I first found out.<eos> But if you do believe it, don't ignore it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll do...<eos> I'll do whatever you want.
I tried my best.<eos> I did everything I could.<eos> There's only one cop left to kill.<eos> It's gotta be you, kid.<eos> You're the only one who can make this right.<eos> Arthur.<eos> Oh, shit. Don't quit on me now.<eos> Your friend is dying.<eos> Well, then do something.<eos> You can't change his fate.

"Error"?<eos> Heavens, no.<eos> An opportunity.<eos> An unpredictable narrative device.<eos> I've given you a story.<eos> I have given you a show.<eos> Arthur Bailey's of no concern.<eos> Why am I talking to you?<eos> Where's the old man?<eos> You are not worthy of his attention.

You do not see the big picture, Mr. Slink.<eos> Your show's viewers, the Heart execs who finance your race, are considering going to broadcast soon.<eos> "Broadcast"?<eos> That's impossible.<eos> The government would shut us down.<eos> Besides, this is... this is art, not fodder for the masses.<eos> We think the world might be ready to embrace such a violent concept in the near future, which means the race could be seen around the entire planet.<eos> It would be quite a spotlight for you.<eos> Well, that's... that's wonderful.<eos> A spotlight that, quite frankly, we're not sure you're ready for.

Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm... I'm holding.<eos> Hello!<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hello.<eos> Who else is on the call?<eos> Julian.<eos> You called me. Jonathan?
Take that!<eos> - Good shot!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> You know what?<eos> There are just a few things that are missing in some of these relationship scenes, and we'd love it if you'd consider adding, maybe, some ADR, some different music choices.<eos> We need more Clowndick.<eos> Let's all make sure we stay ahead of the curve.<eos> And the Grace/Arthur thing feels kinda okay.<eos> But, you know, a little bit stagnant.

Use them.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Hey, team, need a color on this perimeter.<eos> - Follow me.<eos> - Eyes front.<eos> - Blue team, this way.<eos> - You got a tight grip on them.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Arthur.<eos> Glad you speak English. That's...
- What's your name?<eos> - Arthur.<eos> Glad you speak English. That's...<eos> Oh, the jargon.<eos> It may sound like nonsense to you, but it's been a long time since they've seen anyone from the outside world.<eos> You may get a little insular, but it's good for team building.<eos> - It helps us survive.<eos> - Survive? Can't be more than a day's walk to the main road.<eos> Emphasis on "day."<eos> What the hell are you doing here?

Emphasis on "day."<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> And how did you have enough gas to get this far into the Dry Zone?<eos> That thing must guzzle.<eos> You're... not wrong.<eos> Okay. Look, look, look.<eos> I'm a racer who was forced to detour here, okay?<eos> I mean you no harm.<eos> I just want the car and I'll be on my way.<eos> You can't go anywhere at night.
- We?<eos> - That's right, we.<eos> You know what?<eos> You can stay.<eos> I think I'll keep her instead.<eos> What the fuck was that?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God, they got inside.<eos> How did they get inside?<eos> When you snuck in here, did you secure the doors behind you?

Eyes.<eos> Those are eyes.<eos> And if these lights go out, you're gonna see some teeth.
It's time to make some impact. Yes, sir.<eos> - 110%?<eos> - 110%.<eos> Let's make hay.<eos> Liquidated.<eos> No!<eos> They used to be people.<eos> We call them Glimmers.<eos> They won't come into the light.<eos> What do you mean used to be?
I've never seen anything like it.<eos> I was at a gas station, filling up.<eos> This kid runs out of nowhere. and shoves a hose in his mouth.<eos> He was drinking the gasoline.<eos> His face was ripped open and metal shards and he was bleeding this toxic green sludge.<eos> - They were addicted, deranged, and homicidal.<eos> City fell overnight.<eos> Anyone who drank the water turned into one of those things.<eos> And they'll do anything to get to our gasoline.<eos> So why are you still here?

We scavenge during the day when it's safe.<eos> We've got food stored.<eos> Well, it's enough to last a few years.<eos> Yeah, well we're not staying for Thanksgiving dinner, so what's behind that thing?<eos> That's the road out of the city.<eos> But we need power to open the doors, and we don't have enough gas.<eos> We try that now, we drain the generator.<eos> Yeah, okay, so we just power the door and get the hell out of here.<eos> And then the lights go out and the Glimmers tear us all apart.<eos> Even if you get the doors open, you won't make it.

Well, now there's really too much Arthur and Grace.<eos> We really feel like we should see more of the other racers.<eos> I mean, what's The Gentleman doing in all of this?<eos> Give me more of a budget and I'll show you.<eos> Also, we're a little confused by the creatures.<eos> Glimmers?<eos> Is that what they're called? Yes.<eos> They said the fucking name.<eos> It's a bit of a hat on a hat.<eos> You're sounding a little bit agitated.
Is that what they're called? Yes.<eos> They said the fucking name.<eos> It's a bit of a hat on a hat.<eos> You're sounding a little bit agitated.<eos> We're just trying to work as a team, here.<eos> Unders... I understand we're all here together.<eos> We're all making it happen together.<eos> And I'm a team player and I want to make sure that I bring out the best in everyone that I am working with.<eos> I'm listening, go ahead.<eos> Back at the car, you said everybody thinks you're a prophet.

It'll crush you.
There's just some darkness you can't come back from.<eos> There's always a way back.<eos> Back at the car, your friend said Sexy Suzy doesn't run on gas.<eos> What'd she mean?<eos> Oh, that...<eos> I've seen some pretty weird things these last few years.<eos> Ah, what the hell.<eos> The car runs on blood.<eos> See?<eos> Told you you wouldn't believe me.
Which is why it'll go smoother if we let my friends here do the talking.<eos> You asked for my help.<eos> Do me the courtesy of trying it my way, please.<eos> Fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> But it's honey, not sugar.<eos> Dipshit.<eos> - Welcome to Kane Hill.<eos> - Happy Halloween.<eos> You know it's June, right?
Fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> But it's honey, not sugar.<eos> Dipshit.<eos> - Welcome to Kane Hill.<eos> - Happy Halloween.<eos> You know it's June, right?<eos> Uh, I'm officer Bailey, and this is my partner...<eos> I'm here to find my sister, Karma d'argento.<eos> You can call Dr. Kleinfeld if there's a problem... she was transferred.

I can draw you a map.<eos> That sounds great.<eos> That works.<eos> - Okay, that's it!<eos> - Okay, easy, easy, Grace!<eos> Your blood sugar's tanking.<eos> Uh, I think it's time we get her a muffin.<eos> Uh, we'll take it from here.<eos> Thanks so much for your help.<eos> If you could just buzz us in, that'd be perfecto.
Must have been some dream.<eos> So why am I still restrained?<eos> While we have you, we need a few... Samples.<eos> Samples for what?<eos> Your bodily fluids tell us the story of who you are.<eos> We'll need to harvest them, all of them, should we ever want to reproduce your best features.<eos> If that's all you want, all you gotta do is ask, baby.<eos> That's why I like you, Christopher.<eos> Always looking for the silver lining.<eos> Hey, have you seen Dr. Kleinfeld?
One beer, no drugs, especially not red.<eos> Got it.<eos> Okay, now you've gotta be a big brave little dog while daddy goes in there, and... Cuts up some bacon for your breakfast.<eos> Give me some sugar.<eos> Happy Halloween.<eos> Your candy bowl's empty.<eos> So tell me...<eos> How long you crazy fucks been running this place?<eos> Oh, come on, seriously?<eos> Are you real?
Shit.<eos> They hate it when the emergency lights come on.<eos> It makes them violent.<eos> - Okay, no, no.<eos> - Stay with me.<eos> I'm a cop.<eos> It's much safer with me, okay?<eos> Yeah, until they kill you.<eos> Okay, let's look at the bright side...<eos> - do you have any food?

They killed another one.<eos> Another what?<eos> Wait. That wasn't paint?<eos> This is where the riot came to a head.<eos> God-awful slaughtering.<eos> They sacrifice another employee every week in remembrance.<eos> Well, there was only two patients in there.<eos> - I can take them.<eos> - And if the other patients come running, we're both dead.<eos> You can't do anything for them.
- I can take them.<eos> - And if the other patients come running, we're both dead.<eos> You can't do anything for them.<eos> They're beyond help, but I'm not.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Anne, help me.<eos> Anne!<eos> Anne!<eos> Will you stop?

Come on.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Anne, help me.<eos> Anne!<eos> Anne!<eos> Will you stop?<eos> You're gonna get us both killed.<eos> When was the last time these patients took their meds?<eos> This place hasn't been an actual hospital in years.<eos> What do you mean?
Now, go over there.<eos> Wag your tail.<eos> Wag it, wag it, wag.<eos> Wag your tail!<eos> Now lick your balls.<eos> Lick 'em, lick 'em, lick 'em, lick 'em, lick 'em, lick 'em!<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Dr. Kleinfeld.<eos> It's Grace, Grace d'argento.<eos> Dr. Kleinfeld, you treated my sister, Karma.
Oh, my god.<eos> Dr. Kleinfeld.<eos> It's Grace, Grace d'argento.<eos> Dr. Kleinfeld, you treated my sister, Karma.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Dr. Kleinfeld, come back. Come back to me.<eos> Come back to me!<eos> Dr. Kleinfeld, it's Grace. - Grace...<eos> - Where's my sister?<eos> You gotta save them, Grace.

What's your story?<eos> I want my candy.<eos> - Where's my candy?<eos> - Bitch!<eos> Welcome to wonderland, Alice.<eos> Let go of me, you jizzy pedophile! I know my rights!<eos> Come on!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Off me!<eos> I know it may not feel like it, but you're doing the right thing.
You're so full of shit, Grace!<eos> Twatsicle whore!<eos> I hope that primo dick gave you gonorrhea!<eos> What now, doctor?<eos> I have never seen anybody take so much red.<eos> We're not even sure what the long-term consequences might be.<eos> She may very well have permanent psychosis.<eos> She's gonna have to stay indefinitely.<eos> The state will cover two weeks payment.<eos> Do you have a plan to pay her bills after that?
Previously on "Blood Drive"...<eos> All your security privileges are revoked, and you're not to leave the building.
Previously on "Blood Drive"...<eos> All your security privileges are revoked, and you're not to leave the building.<eos> But know this, you will never be a part of your race again.
And that pleasing aroma is not for God.<eos> It's for Heart Enterprises, the most powerful corporation in the known universe!<eos> But this sacrifice could be for you as well.<eos> This is what we're offering.<eos> Not a job, not a career, but... the chance to be worshipped.<eos> Master of Ceremonies?<eos> Fine.<eos> God of the Stage?<eos> Sure, whatevs.<eos> But if you have just a modicum of the oily black soul that we think you do, well, when this show goes live to the whole world, you'll be the High Priest of Heart.

Trust me, they care.<eos> Would you date a guy who ordered a veggie burger?<eos> Depends.<eos> Is he cute?<eos> Hi, can I take your order?<eos> Yeah, uh, can I have a number two with a Coke?<eos> And, um...<eos> Give me just a second, if you don't mind.<eos> Take your time.<eos> Just hit the silver button when you're ready.
And I have seen our reward.<eos> The pain of eternity and the sweet, wet caress of agony.<eos> It's a place no cameras have ever been before, until now, and as the Blood Drive heads straight into The Scar, bringing our racers face-to-face with their deepest fears...<eos> God damn it, Slink.<eos> Just let me eat in peace.<eos> But it's... it's a good pitch.<eos> This is my life's work.<eos> Was your life's work.<eos> I'm loving this new look on you.<eos> I think you found your true calling.

What's this?<eos> What is this?<eos> A spin-off?<eos> A crossover episode?<eos> The Gentleman's our new Master of Ceremonies.<eos> He stole your fire, your thunder, and your job.<eos> When the show premieres to the outside world, he will be the true star.<eos> We're editing you down to a cameo.<eos> Any final notes?<eos> You missed a spot.
So this is test subject number 39462, one Mr. Denali.<eos> Thank you for volunteering.<eos> Now, I've managed to stabilize every single one of my serums into a single compound... the negative side effects of Smax, the brain-altering aspects of Red rapture.<eos> What I'm holding here is either more powerful, more important to humanity, more shockingly destructive than the atomic bomb, or it's just a bunch of shit mixed together.<eos> Either way, I am unable to test it until I have more lab results...<eos> Cut that. Cut.<eos> Cut, cut, cut!<eos> He never should have gotten out.<eos> God, this is terrible.<eos> But I thought you wanted more carnage.
That freak killed half the racers.<eos> How can I test engines without a race?<eos> This is your fault!<eos> I know it.<eos> Me?<eos> But I've been held captive here at Heart Tower like a damsel in distress.<eos> How could it possibly be my fault?<eos> That's the cop's old partner.<eos> What's he doing here?<eos> You'd have to ask the Aki unit in charge of him.

You have one more chance.

I'm kind of tired of fighting.<eos> I'll make you a deal.<eos> Just come squash me and put me out of my misery.<eos> Good job, Barbie.<eos> You too.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Hello, Christopher.<eos> Care to join us?<eos> This is my room.<eos> You can watch, but... you have to get naked.

That's how they control their prisoners.<eos> I'm not a prisoner.<eos> Why do I feel this way?<eos> What have you done to me?<eos> Think about it, Officer.<eos> She's not human.<eos> She's a sex toy.<eos> I'm the one that did this to you.<eos> What?<eos> You're a fucking cop!

Pretty sure that some of you out there might just be able to relate, but this morning we begin with the most frightening words in all of Blood Drive:<eos> There's been a change of plan.<eos> For the first time in Blood Drive history, we're racing directly through the Savage Land.<eos> Drivers, start your engines.<eos> What do... what are you...<eos> You make it too easy.<eos> Lighten up, Barbie.<eos> We've just got grenades in our heads, driving blood-drinking cars through the wasteland in order to find Karma.<eos> Piece of cake.<eos> As a gentle reminder to keep that right foot down and your eyes on the prize, we rigged your car to shut down for ten minutes if you touch the brakes even for a moment.
- Impossible.<eos> - You're aware of our policy mandating the use of the Oxford comma?<eos> - What the fuck, man?<eos> - Nothing more than a stylistic conceit of publishing houses.<eos> Entirely gratuitous to precise language.<eos> That's enough, Slink.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> All this bend-your-wrist song and dance horseshit just doesn't do it for me.<eos> Here's the top line note.<eos> Between the Meadeville fiasco and the escapades at Kane Hill, you've lost control.

What?<eos> But how?<eos> How?<eos> You... you...<eos> you can't just... just plop the "Blood Drive" into people's homes without my guiding hand.<eos> A work like this, it needs a singular voice, an artist, and I will not compromise my vision for anyone.<eos> We don't need you.<eos> Fine.<eos> We'll do it your way then, but I'd like a larger trailer.<eos> Just tell me what you want.

You speak the language.<eos> Afternoon.<eos> You folks in a hurry?<eos> Yeah, sorry, officer.<eos> We're just, uh, trying to make up some time in the back roads.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Uh, yes, sir.<eos> Right as rain.<eos> Just, uh, been a long haul.<eos> And you, ma'am?
Just, uh, been a long haul.<eos> And you, ma'am?<eos> You okay?<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm absolutely fine, sir. - Thanks.<eos> - Uh, you know,<eos> I have a lot of respect for the badge.<eos> Los Angeles.<eos> Damn shame what they did to that force.<eos> Turning them into a bunch of clock-punching civilians.<eos> You're a long way from Los Angeles.

You're a long way from Los Angeles.<eos> Where you headed?<eos> Uh, Red River.<eos> What's your business there?<eos> - We under arrest? - Not yet.<eos> But I clocked you at 92 per.<eos> Right, um, and like I said, - I'm so sorry, um...<eos> - I could use some help. - Police help.<eos> - Oh, we'd love to.<eos> But like you said, we're really in a rush.
I like you, lady.<eos> Being useful is the best thing you can be.<eos> Let's go.<eos> It started with The Scar.<eos> That God damn rip created all kinds of horrible shit.<eos> People got sick, went crazy.<eos> Took me a while. I finally figured it out.<eos> We were getting our electricity from the Worktel power grid, part of which hung over The Scar.<eos> Whatever evil was seeping out of that wound, was getting to us through the power lines.<eos> What do you mean, evil? I cut the lines.

What do you mean, evil? I cut the lines.<eos> Thought that would solve it.<eos> But the sickness was already here.<eos> - So what do you need from us?<eos> - Well, the sickness got into some of the townsfolk, twisted them up inside.<eos> Started using electricity as a weapon.<eos> Cattle prods, Tasers.<eos> Only way to stop them was to fire up a juice killer.<eos> Ain't got no juice, they ain't a threat no more.<eos> So you have a pretty solid way of keeping them out.

So who cares?<eos> I'm gonna be alone, I might as well be alone here.<eos> Yeah...<eos> I'm alone, too.<eos> Whiskey.<eos> Any brand.<eos> We don't serve any alcohol here.<eos> The sheriff won't allow it.<eos> So what the hell do you serve? Espresso.<eos> You read the sign, right?
We don't serve any alcohol here.<eos> The sheriff won't allow it.<eos> So what the hell do you serve? Espresso.<eos> You read the sign, right?<eos> - Just espresso?<eos> - Just espresso.<eos> Unwashed Ethiopian peaberry.<eos> Fire cracked and sun soaked for exactly 37 hours. Wait, what?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> You lost me when you said no fuckin' whiskey.
Oh, sorry.<eos> You lost me when you said no fuckin' whiskey.<eos> Care to repeat it?<eos> - Unwashed Ethiopian peaberry...<eos> - Rhetorical.<eos> I hear you wanna kill me.<eos> You're gonna sit down and watch me drink this whiskey until the bottle's empty.<eos> Then you die.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> You're late.
- Rhetorical.<eos> I hear you wanna kill me.<eos> You're gonna sit down and watch me drink this whiskey until the bottle's empty.<eos> Then you die.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> You're late.<eos> Here's the rebel power station.<eos> Defenses? Electrified fencing all around it.<eos> We won't get close enough to strike while they still have juice.<eos> Put those on... they'll kill you if they see they uniform.

Hook up your pack.<eos> That'll shut down their power.<eos> Defenses go dark, we go in.<eos> You're gonna arrest them, right?
He really is a handsome devil, isn't he?<eos> Police bought the shit when they sold our contracts to a private company.<eos> - We used to be cops, remember?<eos> - We still are.<eos> - We're still the good guys.<eos> - People are afraid.<eos> Good, fear keeps them in line.<eos> I need help. Please help me.<eos> Calm down, ma'am.<eos> Tell me where you are.
Good, fear keeps them in line.<eos> I need help. Please help me.<eos> Calm down, ma'am.<eos> Tell me where you are.<eos> Aah, they're coming!<eos> They're gonna eat me.<eos> Don't know you, stranger.<eos> I'm not from here and I'm not staying.<eos> I'm from the west, trying to get past The Scar.<eos> How'd you get through Red River? I didn't.
I'm not from here and I'm not staying.<eos> I'm from the west, trying to get past The Scar.<eos> How'd you get through Red River? I didn't.<eos> Left my car at a garage.<eos> I need to charge my power pack.<eos> Person there said this is the only place with juice for 100 miles.<eos> We don't trade with people we don't know.<eos> I've got water.<eos> Distilled from the Pacific Northwest.<eos> How much power do you need?

I didn't.<eos> I'm from the California Territory.<eos> What do you do for work?<eos> I was a mailman.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That seems right.<eos> This way.<eos> Come on.<eos> So what happened between you and Sheriff Leon?<eos> Soon as you're full, you're gone.

Get him back to town.<eos> All right, you've got the upper hand.<eos> Now why don't we just pull some wire back to Red River - and turn the power back on?<eos> - After the trial.<eos> Tell your men to take it easy. These are families.<eos> He's right.<eos> Don't rough 'em up too much.<eos> We want them to be awake when their necks snap.<eos> Time to build the gallows, boys.<eos> Seems like you already know how the trial's gonna end, Sheriff.
You're on your own.<eos> He's gonna kill a kid, Grace. Please.<eos> What if this was Karma?<eos> Karma's dead.<eos> Okay?<eos> So you go fight your own demons.<eos> I'll fight mine.<eos> I...<eos> Can't let you do this, Sheriff. I ain't asking you.<eos> You know this isn't right.
Okay?<eos> So you go fight your own demons.<eos> I'll fight mine.<eos> I...<eos> Can't let you do this, Sheriff. I ain't asking you.<eos> You know this isn't right.<eos> I ain't taking life advice from a tin star.<eos> Out here, justice is in the hand of the man holding the gun.<eos> And it's swift.<eos> You would shoot an unarmed cop? You ain't a cop.
And it's swift.<eos> You would shoot an unarmed cop? You ain't a cop.<eos> You're just some asshole in a costume.<eos> Tell the hangman, grab another rope.<eos> We got one more coming.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Unwashed Ethiopian peaberry.<eos> Fire cracked and sun soaked for exactly 37 hours. Wait, what?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> You lost me when you said no fuckin' whiskey.
My hat!<eos> This is vintage!<eos> I told you.<eos> You can't hurt me.<eos> You certainly can't kill me.<eos> I wasn't trying to kill you.<eos> Needed this.<eos> It won't work.<eos> I have to try.<eos> You think you're the first innocent man in this jail?

You're right.<eos> I feel.<eos> I actually feel.<eos> Our connection caused a kernel boot error. A severe stack overflow.<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> It means I love you, Christopher.<eos> I love you too, Aki.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> We get the hell out of this city.<eos> - You don't have to do this.
I don't give a shit about being the Primo.<eos> But I do care about the $10 million.<eos> That's enough to get my sister the help that she needs and set us up for life.<eos> And no one's gonna get in the way of that happening.<eos> So buckle up, pal, 'cause the last one to this party tonight is a dead man.<eos> And so long as you have that bomb implanted in your neck, you're no longer a cop.<eos> You're just another racer... and we're stuck with each other.<eos> Then we have a problem, 'cause as long as I'm here, no one's going in your engine, and that's a promise.<eos> Yeah, well... we'll just cross that bridge when we come to it, shall we?<eos> You have reached your water limit.

Stay awake.<eos> [ENGINE STARTS]<eos> Hello?<eos> JIMMY:<eos> Oh, hey. Come on in.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Francesca Liddy.<eos> - I'm here for the interview.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Jimmy McGill. Hey, are you running early, or am I running late?
It's not a problem.<eos> Never bad to be early... except in death and taxes, and... - some other things.<eos> - Hey, can I ask you a question?<eos> - Sure. Does that look straight to you?<eos> I think there... that side...<eos> I think you're a little crooked.<eos> The bottom of the "M" there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A little crooked.<eos> So you're coming off of seven years at the MVD?
A little crooked.<eos> So you're coming off of seven years at the MVD?<eos> - I am, yeah.<eos> - Here's a question.<eos> How come New Mexico doesn't call it the DMV like every other state?<eos> Well, that's a great question.<eos> Just like in Arizona... the Motor Vehicles Division is part of the DOT, a division.<eos> Whereas, in most other states, the DMV... or Department of Motor Vehicles is its own entity.<eos> So I don't know if that answers the question, except to say that's the government for you.<eos> You got that right.

Patience.<eos> Diplomacy.<eos> You meet all sorts of people down there.<eos> And most are really great, really friendly, but you encounter some who are upset...<eos> - ...belligerent.<eos> - What about old folks?<eos> - You get your fair share of them?<eos> - Oh, lots of elderly drivers.<eos> After 75, they need to take their test again, so if they don't pass... you have to explain to them why their license isn't being renewed, which is hard for them.<eos> What do you say then?

Sounds challenging.<eos> So why the law?<eos> I mean, why leave the DMV or MVD?<eos> I have to imagine you'll be giving up a good benefits package.<eos> Good health care and retirement plans, but... there's a bureaucracy to government work, that... ultimately became too frustrating.<eos> I guess what you'd call it, too much red tape.<eos> I just wanna be somewhere I can make a difference.<eos> Well, that's us.<eos> We're all about making a difference.<eos> And I see here both Word and Excel, you're comfortable with?
We're all about making a difference.<eos> And I see here both Word and Excel, you're comfortable with?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Excel and Word, wow!<eos> Well, you had me at old people.<eos> Hey, here's a question.<eos> - I....<eos> - Can...<eos> Yes?<eos> - No, can you... can you just give us a second, Francesca?
Yes?<eos> - No, can you... can you just give us a second, Francesca?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I....<eos> Of course.<eos> Um.... - Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What?<eos> I like her.<eos> "Can you start today?" Don't you think we should see more résumés... like, a lot more?
I got a good feeling about this.<eos> Come on, Kim.<eos> [SIGHS] Now, getting these oldsters to call, that's half the battle, so...<eos> - they need to hear a friendly voice.<eos> - Friendly? Absolutely.<eos> Speak loudly and clearly... but be careful with the loud and clear because it can come off as angry.<eos> Be folksy.<eos> - Put a little sunshine in your voice.<eos> - Got it.<eos> Okay. You need coffee or water?

I'm sorry.<eos> May I put you on hold?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Offices of Jimmy McGill.<eos> Please hold.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Uh.... that's right.<eos> Jimmy McGill from the commercial.<eos> Would you like to come in for a consultation?
Aw. What's her name?<eos> Yeah, Cracker Barrel.<eos> It always helps to mention Cracker Barrel.<eos> Well, I think it's great you let Margaret play inside.<eos> It's a hot one out there.<eos> I was thinking of going to Cracker Barrel because they've got great air-conditioning.<eos> Well, yes, I love their biscuits too.<eos> Well, that's wonderful.<eos> Mm-hm. Yes, I think a will is really important.<eos> When would you like to come in and meet Mr. McGill?
Uh, this Friday is open.<eos> Yes.<eos> Jimmy has a 9:00 free.<eos> Will that work?<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Can you spell your name for me?<eos> And a number we can reach you at?<eos> Okay, Dorothy.<eos> Look forward to seeing you.<eos> You betcha.
Okay, Dorothy.<eos> Look forward to seeing you.<eos> You betcha.<eos> Bye, now.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Thank you for holding.<eos> How may I help you?<eos> Well, I can set you up with an appointment.<eos> Jimmy is busy at the moment, but if you'd like...<eos> You sound like you're outdoors.

Mr. McGill will take your call.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - MIKE: Your new assistant's a real pip.<eos> Yeah, thanks for crushing her spirit on the first day.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> You drive safe.<eos> You the only one on this line?<eos> Yeah, only me.<eos> What's up?<eos> You free for breakfast tomorrow?
Yeah, thanks for crushing her spirit on the first day.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> You drive safe.<eos> You the only one on this line?<eos> Yeah, only me.<eos> What's up?<eos> You free for breakfast tomorrow?<eos> MIKE:<eos> All right. This is what you're gonna do.<eos> You're gonna go inside, buy a cup of coffee, a meal, whatever, and sit in a booth.
Is it money?<eos> It's gotta be money.<eos> Drugs?<eos> Is it drugs?<eos> Something else?<eos> Well, um, I'm guessing money.<eos> - Tell me I'm right. - MIKE:<eos> He is gonna be here any minute.<eos> Now, I need you inside.<eos> You gonna do the job or not?

Would you like the pollos bonus size for 50 cents more?<eos> No.<eos> Normal.<eos> Dining in or to go?<eos> Dining in.<eos> - Will that be all today?<eos> - Uh, yeah.<eos> Your total's $3.19.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Do you want any extra salsa?
- MAN #6:<eos> No. - WOMAN: Dining in or to go?<eos> In.<eos> WOMAN: Will that be all? - Four eighty-nine.<eos> - MAN #6:<eos> MAN #5: When you get behind the eight ball.... MAN #7:<eos> Sure.<eos> You're right.<eos> Yeah, no problem.<eos> - WOMAN: Do you need any extra salsa?
MAN #8: Here's a number three.<eos> WOMAN: Here you go.<eos> Have a great day.<eos> MAN #1: Manuel, where's my 22?<eos> MANUEL: Coming up.<eos> MAN #1: Pick it up.<eos> WOMAN: Thank you for coming to Los Pollos Hermanos.<eos> Have a great day now.<eos> Hi. Welcome to Los Pollos Hermanos.<eos> MAN #1: You ready or are you still looking?
No problem.<eos> It's my pleasure.<eos> Is there anything else I can do for you?<eos> Uh.... no.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You take care.<eos> - MIKE: Tell me again. - JIMMY:<eos> Jesus.<eos> How many different ways you want me to say it?<eos> MIKE: Just tell me what you saw.

He ordered the number three with potatoes and coffee... went bold with the extra salsa... and he paid cash out of his left front pocket.<eos> Took his tray of food, sat in a booth on the east side of the restaurant... and put the knapsack on the floor.<eos> Where on the floor?<eos> Under his seat, between his legs.<eos> Nobody touched it.<eos> He didn't talk to anybody.<eos> He didn't even look at anybody.<eos> Finished his meal in five minutes tops, and skedaddled.<eos> Didn't leave anything behind.<eos> - And you're sure of that?
He didn't talk to anybody.<eos> He didn't even look at anybody.<eos> Finished his meal in five minutes tops, and skedaddled.<eos> Didn't leave anything behind.<eos> - And you're sure of that?<eos> - I literally checked the trash can.<eos> There was nothing in there but trash.<eos> So... what's our next move, huh?<eos> Are we gonna follow this guy?<eos> Because you... you got some real James Bond stuff in here.
Thursday okay?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> That's fine. - Okay.<eos> Francesca, have we got any more of those dietetic butter cookies?<eos> - FRANCESCA: I can check.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Welcome, folks.<eos> Hey, Ernie.<eos> What's up?<eos> Can't you just come inside?
Welcome, folks.<eos> Hey, Ernie.<eos> What's up?<eos> Can't you just come inside?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What are we doing out here?<eos> I didn't wanna call you because then it would leave a phone record.<eos> I was gonna come in, but... then I thought maybe Jimmy shouldn't see me. - So...<eos> - But you just called me. Oh.

You can start by just telling me.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> I have some information, but I don't wanna get in trouble.<eos> Trouble with Jimmy?<eos> No.<eos> HHM.<eos> I think I'm bound by confidentiality, maybe?<eos> I'm a little hazy on the legal points... but if I tell you what I heard and not Jimmy directly... like.... like we have a buffer...<eos> - ...then legally, I'm safe? - Ernie.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?

He made that tape for a reason... and we just have to figure out why.<eos> Jimmy?<eos> I gotta get back to it.<eos> The lobby's full of clients. Okay.<eos> We'll figure this out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know.<eos> Sorry for the delay, everyone.<eos> Mr. Witchell, thank you for your patience.<eos> I see you brought paperwork.
Mr. Witchell, thank you for your patience.<eos> I see you brought paperwork.<eos> JIMMY: I gotta say... I would never have thought to collect bottle caps.<eos> Oh, it's a wonderful hobby.<eos> What excites me is the hunt. Heh.<eos> I can imagine.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Tiller.<eos> Why, thank you, Jimmy.<eos> - All right, then.<eos> You drive safe.
I can imagine.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Tiller.<eos> Why, thank you, Jimmy.<eos> - All right, then.<eos> You drive safe.<eos> - Oh, I do.<eos> JIMMY: Is that the last one, or we got any stragglers coming through?<eos> FRANCESCA: Last one.<eos> Well, hey, thanks, Francesca.<eos> You were great today.

Or did you make copies?<eos> Huh, Chuck? Huh?<eos> You tell me, or I'll burn this whole goddamn house to the ground.<eos> Jimmy.<eos> Jimmy.<eos> That's enough.<eos> You need to step away.<eos> Howard... you were a witness to what happened here?<eos> I was.<eos> And you?
I'm looking forward to it.<eos> Making anything special?<eos> Oh, no, I'm just grabbing the basics.<eos> I don't cook the way you do.<eos> Never too late to learn.<eos> Have a great day.<eos> I went in last week and did all the start paperwork.<eos> Oh, and I'm gonna need to figure out new times with you.<eos> That's fine.<eos> I'm just glad to hear you're going back.
She mentioned some woman.<eos> - Interesting.<eos> - She didn't say much. And I didn't pry, because I'm never gonna get a straight answer out of her unless she wants to give it.<eos> But she seemed curious.<eos> Do you have any idea why she brought this woman up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Right.<eos> So, this week's homework might seem extreme, but it's very typical practice... when dealing with any kind of addiction.<eos> It does seem kind of extreme.<eos> I know how much you care, and how much you think you need her, I get it.

People evolve, so do relationships.<eos> I know.<eos> I was just giving you context.<eos> We're not talking about a small change here.<eos> I barely get her for two minutes on the phone when she calls.<eos> Let me ask you, what do you think Rebecca's take on your relationship is right now?<eos> Well, she'd probably say I'm overbearing, and too judgmental, but I'm her mother.<eos> And no one else is gonna stay up at night and worry like I am.<eos> I want Rebecca to be settled down and happy.<eos> Well, you know, you have a kid.

She started not having enough time for me.<eos> It's really that simple.<eos> But you've heard me say before that relationships aren't singular, right?<eos> Did you contribute at all to Rebecca pushing you away?<eos> No, I stayed the same.<eos> I've been the same.<eos> She changed.<eos> You know, I really like you, Jean, but... honestly, I've been thinking lately that maybe therapy isn't helping me that much.<eos> Maybe we...<eos> Do you think it's...

Well, she's supposedly doing a lot better.<eos> Might even be released soon.<eos> I can't get involved, you know?<eos> She's just too erratic, and I need to maintain my boundaries.<eos> Okay.<eos> Of course. I understand.<eos> Record your message after the tone.<eos> Hi, Allison. This is Jean Holloway.<eos> I was expecting you at 3:00 p.m.<eos> If you can call the office, please, at 212-555-0168, and we can discuss.
If he can't handle it, he shouldn't have come.<eos> I'm glad to know you think I'm so alluring.<eos> Oh, um, Monday night my friend Josh is hosting this pop up thing in Bushwick.<eos> I have plans, actually.<eos> I thought you were curious.<eos> It's a little more complicated than that.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, uh... it's off the Morgan stop, at the old Red Lumber factory.<eos> If you feel like a change.<eos> Allison, what are you doing here?

Okay, hold on, hold on.<eos> Okay, I understand.<eos> Just... just please sit for one minute, okay?<eos> I know you want to displace your anger onto me, and that's fine.

Listen, I know it feels impossible right now. But there are programs.<eos> It's not the drugs, I'm...<eos> Then what is it?<eos> It's Tom.<eos> It's my boyfriend.<eos> He...<eos> I came home last time after coming to see you, and I said that we should cool it. And he got angry, he's just a different person when he uses.<eos> He can...<eos> And he sells everything, just pills, coke, Fentanyl, and I won't touch that shit 'cause I know it's too addicting.<eos> But it's gonna be hard to get clean if you're always around it.

What salon?<eos> Um, down by Irving Place.<eos> Oh, Jesus, did you go downtown to come back uptown? - I'm sorry.<eos> - It's nothing.<eos> Anyway, let's make a toast.<eos> To this new chapter in your life.<eos> It's a fresh start.<eos> It's inspiring.<eos> By my count, that's now the sixth time that's happened, sixth.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna give you some fairly standard protocol on an internal investigation, Frank, just to be clear.

I mean, just, you know, let me do my fucking job.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Oh, don't apologize.<eos> It seems like everyone there is guilty.<eos> It's demoralizing.<eos> Well, you're in this business enough, you see that a lot, unfortunately.<eos> Oh, I like to think people are more human than evil.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> If you wanna bring your dinner in here, we can keep talking about the case.
- People here are full of shit.<eos> Anyway, he was a lit agent, and I worked there as an intern.<eos> And I realize how that sounds, but, I mean, he wasn't my boss.<eos> We had no interaction in the office whatsoever.<eos> And when it did get serious, I gave up the job.<eos> But, uh, whatever, it's over.<eos> It's not even worth talking about.<eos> I went on a date with my law professor once.<eos> Uh, not actually, or not on purpose.<eos> What do you mean?
What train are you taking home?<eos> I was thinking maybe we could go together.<eos> I'm gonna be here late again.<eos> I'm probably just gonna take a car home.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Okay, no worries.<eos> Text me when you're heading home.<eos> - Okay, you too, honey.<eos> - All right, bye, love you.<eos> Uh, you want some more?

Oh, great.<eos> You're a lifesaver, thanks.
Looks like you found Nirvana.<eos> Your other hand.<eos> Surprised?<eos> No.<eos> You want?<eos> Yeah, definitely.<eos> Josh, Zal, this is Diane.<eos> Zal and I go way back.<eos> Don't tell her jack shit.<eos> So, how do you know Sid?
No.<eos> You want?<eos> Yeah, definitely.<eos> Josh, Zal, this is Diane.<eos> Zal and I go way back.<eos> Don't tell her jack shit.<eos> So, how do you know Sid?<eos> Um, well, I... we just met recently. At the café.<eos> I hate that place.<eos> Did you know Sam, her ex?
Sweet dreams.<eos> Good night.<eos> Oh, hey there, creeper.<eos> Hey, sorry.<eos> You look so good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I have a surprise for you.<eos> Um, I knew we were running low and you're really into bourbon these days, so...<eos> You really are the best, you know that? Mm-hmm.<eos> - Can I buy you a drink, Mr. Holloway? - Absolutely.
The last time you used a rune to track Jace, it almost killed you.<eos> Why can't you just do this one thing?<eos> You don't understand, I saw them burn.<eos> Sorry, I just wanted to make sure everything was...<eos> - Okay. - Luke.<eos> You all right?<eos> Is it true? Is Jonathan alive?<eos> I couldn't believe it either at first.<eos> - Simon.<eos> - Hey, Mrs. F. Good to see you on your feet again.
Effective immediately, the Institute is on lockdown.<eos> But it's only temporary.<eos> Wait, if we're on lockdown, who's out there looking for Jace?<eos> We'll think of something.<eos> Don't worry. Jace is tough.<eos> I killed you twice today.<eos> You want to go for another round, huh?<eos> You're a born fighter.<eos> I like it.<eos> You wanted to see me?
Right now?<eos> You know damn well I want to find Jace just as much as you do, but that's no excuse to treat me like...<eos> At the moment... Nothing.<eos> Who sounded the alarm?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Jace.<eos> Aldertree said he wanted to rescue Jace.<eos> Actually, Clary, I said I wanted to find him.<eos> And you gave me the clue I needed to do just that.
First up, all Downworlders are forbidden from entering the Institute without my prior approval.<eos> For those still present, good day.<eos> Mr. Graymark...<eos> I'm not leaving Jocelyn.<eos> Besides, my badge gives access to resources that you don't have.<eos> I can help you find Jace.<eos> That's generous of you, but I'm going to have to insist.<eos> - Call me when you can.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You, too...
I can help you find Jace.<eos> That's generous of you, but I'm going to have to insist.<eos> - Call me when you can.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You, too...<eos> Simon.<eos> Simon, right?<eos> It's almost dawn.<eos> I don't have anywhere to go.<eos> Hey, you're a smart guy.

Given your relationship to Valentine and Jace, I want to keep a close eye on you.<eos> This is ridiculous!<eos> - Clary...<eos> - No!<eos> We cannot just sit around.<eos> Okay, they're going to kill Jace.<eos> He's your son.<eos> I know you think you understand this world, but you don't.<eos> Dismissed!<eos> You can't do this.
Note the past tense.<eos> When Reggie's wife, Maria, turned into a vampire, she slaughtered Reggie and created a den inside.<eos> You really think love will keep you from hurting your family and friends?<eos> No matter how hard you fight it, demon blood will make you kill. It starts in a small way.<eos> Urges.<eos> See, that's why you want Clary, and that is why you always will.<eos> Hey, out!<eos> Who's asking?<eos> Izzy and I will bring him back alive.<eos> One step ahead of you.
Urges.<eos> See, that's why you want Clary, and that is why you always will.<eos> Hey, out!<eos> Who's asking?<eos> Izzy and I will bring him back alive.<eos> One step ahead of you.<eos> We got a hit on the map.<eos> We're mobilizing now.<eos> You're not listening. Go ahead and de-rune me.<eos> We won't let you do this.
You're wrong.<eos> Like I was wrong about your mother?<eos> Look, I know you even better than you know yourself.<eos> You... you don't know me at all.<eos> You saved my life. You could've Portaled me anywhere, handed me over to the Clave in Idris, but did you?<eos> No, because deep down inside, you know that I'm right.<eos> Clary, please let me explain.<eos> Lydia.<eos> This wasn't my fault and you know it.<eos> You're responsible for the actions of the Institute, are you not?
But we did see what Jace did to that vampire before he grabbed Valentine and then disappeared.<eos> Aldertree's ready for you.<eos> Can't wait.<eos> - Nice to see you again, Simon.<eos> - Nice to be seen.<eos> Let's discuss the vampire den, shall we? Yes.<eos> Completely disgusting.<eos> I mean, ridiculously unsanitary.<eos> Who does that?<eos> That's what I need you to find out.
Who does that?<eos> That's what I need you to find out.<eos> Me?<eos> I'm not exactly in on the management decisions.<eos> I'm... I'm more on the ground floor.<eos> Which is exactly why I'm asking you, my friend.<eos> Right.<eos> After the recent unrest amongst the local vamps, I can't trust my intel.<eos> And how do you expect me to figure that out for you?<eos> You seem resourceful.

Just keep your cool in front of the boss.<eos> You have your orders.<eos> Dismissed.<eos> Lydia.<eos> Lydia, please.<eos> You need all hands on deck.<eos> Let me help.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Your lack of training is a liability.<eos> Besides, you're too close to this.

We should look at the aerial drones.<eos> - We've already done that.<eos> - So we do it again. Maybe we didn't look close enough.<eos> Alec, I know you're upset, but this is just...<eos> You don't know, Izzy.<eos> I need him.<eos> I know.<eos> Alec, Isabelle.<eos> I have a way.<eos> How did you get that?
I know.<eos> Alec, Isabelle.<eos> I have a way.<eos> How did you get that?<eos> Only the Iron Sisters have access to adamas.<eos> Luke's mother is an Iron Sister.<eos> She told him about an ancient way to communicate through the parabatai bond.<eos> Through your linked spirits.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> So you want me to help you find my brother, so you can try and kill him again?
Look, I owe you.<eos> Let me help with Alec.<eos> - I think you've done enough.<eos> - I was only trying to find...<eos> You were only trying to do what you always do.<eos> Manipulate people into helping fix problems that you created.<eos> And now Alec is paying the price for it.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Then prove me wrong.<eos> It appears you've had quite the harrowing experience.
That's not true.<eos> Then prove me wrong.<eos> It appears you've had quite the harrowing experience.<eos> Jocelyn tells me you were abducted by Dorothea Rollins, a warlock under Valentine's control.<eos> Uh, that's right.<eos> Did she Portal you to a tanker ship in the East River?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Three hours ago, a large tanker ship was found there, recently abandoned.<eos> By the mottoes and the insignia on the boat, it's clear the Circle was on board.<eos> If you have any information about Valentine, about Jace... you need to tell me.

I woke up in the water.<eos> I was nearly run over by the Staten Island Ferry, and then I swam to shore and came here.<eos> If you're trying to protect your brother, lying to me is only gonna make it worse.

Whose law? Chill, Taito.<eos> I think we've had enough bar fights for one day.<eos> I know the rules.<eos> Blood for blood.<eos> If Jace is really doing Valentine's dirty work, I'll kill him myself.<eos> Best team.<eos> Best team. It's okay, Alec.<eos> You hear me?<eos> We're gonna get you out of here and bring you back.<eos> You put in a request to transfer your brother to Idris?
We're gonna get you out of here and bring you back.<eos> You put in a request to transfer your brother to Idris?<eos> My parents put in the request.<eos> Alec isn't leaving this institute.<eos> I'm sure his warlock friend can figure something out.<eos> Here.<eos> This isn't waking Sleeping Beauty with a kiss.<eos> Runic power is deep.<eos> It requires magic that can't be accessed in the walls of this institute.<eos> I don't know what you're up to, and, ultimately, I don't care.

I don't like being rushed.<eos> Magnus, stop.<eos> We need to get Alec out of here, but this isn't helping.<eos> This can't be right.<eos> I'm telling you, I ran the blood work three times.<eos> Whatever's going on with this guy, it's not normal.<eos> I'll take a look.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Officer?<eos> Any chance you've seen this person?
Any chance you've seen this person?<eos> We got a tip that he might be in the ER.<eos> Over there.<eos> He came in a few hours ago.<eos> But we still need to run a few tests before we can clear...<eos> It's okay.<eos> We just wanna have a quick chat.<eos> Look around.<eos> He's gotta be here somewhere.<eos> Hey, you!

I gotta get out of here right now.<eos> You're not going anywhere.

Still no improvement?<eos> Happy now?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Alec's one of our best.<eos> It'd be a shame to lose him.<eos> We're not gonna lose him.<eos> So confident.<eos> Almost too confident.<eos> Well, that's unfortunate.<eos> When are you gonna realize that Jace is on our side?
We're not gonna lose him.<eos> So confident.<eos> Almost too confident.<eos> Well, that's unfortunate.<eos> When are you gonna realize that Jace is on our side?<eos> Our side doesn't murder werewolves.<eos> So he didn't mention that little transgression.<eos> I'm sure there's an explanation.<eos> Not according to Lucian Graymark's pack.<eos> I was hoping to protect Jace by bringing him here, but clearly you've made other plans.
Not according to Lucian Graymark's pack.<eos> I was hoping to protect Jace by bringing him here, but clearly you've made other plans.<eos> So now it looks like the pack will get their pound of flesh after all.<eos> How far is Luke's pack from closing in on Jace?<eos> Why should I tell you anything?<eos> Because I know where Jace is.<eos> He's at Magnus' loft in Brooklyn.<eos> Well then, the wolves are close.<eos> Getting to him before they do could prove difficult.<eos> Not if you give me access to a Portal.

Of course I did.<eos> I can't believe you didn't tell her we were out on tour.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm sorry, Mom.<eos> My phone died, among other things.<eos> Well, Raphael was so kind to keep me company until we found you.<eos> You know, Simon, you should take better care of your mother.<eos> It's far too late for anyone to be wandering the streets alone.<eos> I know you'd feel horrible if anything were to happen to her.<eos> Oh, you're sweet, but you don't have to worry about me.
You should be looking for Camille, not your mother.<eos> - You're threatening my family.<eos> - And you're threatening mine.<eos> The longer Camille is free, the more people she kills.<eos> My people.<eos> Don't make me stoop to Camille's level.<eos> Well, now that Simon's back, I think it's time I get going.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, I wish there was something I could do to thank you for everything.<eos> You know what? Why don't you join us at our house for dinner?

Why don't you join us at our house for dinner?<eos> We can talk about Simon's music career and his accounting career.<eos> Mom, he can't.<eos> He's extremely busy.<eos> Honey, any friend of yours is a friend of ours.<eos> You are welcome at my house anytime.
Thy people will be my people, thy God will be my God.<eos> When thou diest, I will die.<eos> And there will I be buried.<eos> The Angel do so to me.<eos> And more also...<eos> If aught but death part thee and me.<eos> Please don't leave me, Alec.<eos> If aught but death part thee and me.<eos> Jace Wayland!<eos> You are hereby sentenced to the City of Bones to await trial for the charge of high treason and aiding Valentine in the war against the Clave.
Now, because of you, I'm being called in to answer for it.<eos> Find Camille, or die trying.<eos> You're the only one I know who knows her as well as Raphael.<eos> I know her better.<eos> This helps me how?<eos> If Camille had that snake guarding it, it must be precious to her.<eos> If you can't help him, then you need to go.<eos> Stop. We need to get Alec out of here, but this isn't helping.<eos> Please don't leave me, Alec.<eos> Jace wayland! You are hereby sentenced to the City of Bones. To await trial for the charge of high treason, and aiding Valentine in the war against the Clave.
Not like I had much of a choice.<eos> Believe me, I was hoping to resolve our little Vampire Den dilemma. Without dragging you in here.<eos> But last night, one of my team raided another one in ocean hill.<eos> Fourteen mundanes drained.<eos> Three of them children.<eos> Camille at work.<eos> She's always had a thing for kids.<eos> It has nothing to do with my clan.<eos> Unfortunately, we've reached the limit on kicking the can down the road.<eos> If you want to prove your innocence, deliver Miss Belcourt to the Clave.

I'm not sure I do.<eos> Based on your long list of missteps over the past seven decades, it seems you have a hard time controlling your urges.

I had nothing to do with those feedings.<eos> It must've been Camille.<eos> - Where is she now?<eos> - I told you, I don't know.<eos> And if I did, I'd go over there. And find her myself and stop her.<eos> What a hero you are, Raphael.

What are you doing?<eos> Something new from the Clave RD department.<eos> To convince our vampire friends to cooperate.<eos> Concentrated UV Rays.<eos> Even more intense than sunlight.<eos> Stop!<eos> - Where's Camille?<eos> - I told you.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You can't get away with this.
Unmerciful to the Bone.<eos> That's what's always made you the best.<eos> But this place... It'll bleed every ounce of defiance out of you.<eos> I'm nothing like you.<eos> They want me to bend, they can die trying.<eos> Wait until your trial.<eos> After what they do to you... You will be like me.<eos> Alec...<eos> What happened?<eos> Who are you?
We've got a Demonto Hunt.<eos> If you're trying to make up for your incompetence, don't bother.<eos> I'm not in a making-up mood.<eos> No wonder Alec ditched you for a Warlock.<eos> You want a piece of this?<eos> Lydia!<eos> You're okay.<eos> You stand before the sword, accused of treason against the Clave, as well as the murder of two downworlders.<eos> Be thee innocent or guilty, may the truth free thy soul.<eos> Have you anything to say before we start?

Well, given what that Demonjust did to Lydia, I don't blame you.<eos> - I just saw her in the infirmary.<eos> - How is she?<eos> She's hurt pretty badly, but she's gonna pull through.<eos> It's nice to hear something positive. Yeah.<eos> Mom.<eos> About Idris...<eos> There is a part of me that wants to come with you... But... I have to learn to stand on my own.<eos> And there are people here that I can't leave.<eos> Did you kill the Werewolf Gretel Monroe? No.

It's more than that.<eos> I see.<eos> Do you love your father?<eos> I love the dream of the father I wished he'd be.<eos> The kind of father who wouldn't kill a young boy's Falcon?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know more than you think about you and dear dad.<eos> To love is to destroy.<eos> Quite a harsh lesson for a six-year-old boy.<eos> Do you agree with that sentiment?

Do you agree with that sentiment?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you feel your father's goal to kill all downworlders is just?<eos> Yes and no.<eos> Which one is it?<eos> Both.<eos> My father's world view may be misguided, but I've seen the Vampire Dens that are thriving. Because of the Clave's lack of action.<eos> Your lack of action.<eos> Final question.<eos> Can you pledge your unconditional loyalty to the Clave?

Look where it landed me.<eos> You just lost your mom, too.<eos> What do you feel?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I thought I'd be able to get to know her.<eos> I...<eos> Look at this.<eos> A Shadowhunter on my doorstep. Oh, let me guess.<eos> You're heartbroken and you want some fabulous boy to love you again.<eos> Can you raise my mother from the dead?
So to answer your question... Yes.<eos> I have never seen a doctor's office like this.<eos> Do you live here, too?<eos> Upstairs. On the third floor.<eos> The second floor is reserved for my warlock practice. And down here is where I try to prolong the precious lives of the mundanes.<eos> Keeps a gal busy.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> What's your name?<eos> This is Madzie.<eos> Hi, Madzie. Honey, why don't you go ask Leigh to give you a cookie?
Put the girl down.<eos> Her name is Madzie, and she's better off with me than left to fend for herself in this cruel world.<eos> You can save the redhead, but she still owes me the favor.<eos> Alec. You okay?<eos> We have to find Clary.<eos> Stay back!<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> I don't know. I...<eos> I saw this vision of a rune and... And so I drew it.<eos> You just shot sunlight out of your hand.
anything to stop Valentine.<eos> Ah, Isabelle.<eos> A welcome reprieve from work.<eos> Before I move out on mission, I would like to get a refill for...<eos> Yin fen.<eos> You're using as directed?<eos> One more thing.<eos> Clary would like to join the mission to the Citadel.<eos> But she's not trained. I'll keep an eye on her.<eos> You and Clary have grown close.
He's taken our most valuable weapon.<eos> You must leave immediately.<eos> Clary's done nothing wrong.<eos> Allow me.<eos> What answers do you seek? Why did Valentine go to all that trouble to steal the Soul-Sword?<eos> Yes, Valentine is my father, but that man killed my mother.<eos> He experimented on my brother.<eos> I want to stop him more than anyone.<eos> And if we have any chance at defeating him... we need your help.<eos> Sister Cleophas, how long have you been in the order?

I am.<eos> We must begin the purity trial.<eos> What's that?<eos> For the answers you seek, we must go inside the Citadel.<eos> But we cannot allow any demonic impurities to pass.<eos> The adamas is too fragile.<eos> So, the heavenly energy in the water will help us determine if you may enter.<eos> It will destroy any contaminant upon contact.<eos> Your demon blood makes it impossible to trust you.<eos> So, how about telling me why you and Clary are studying the Gray Book.

I know what you're going through.<eos> How? I don't even know what I'm going through.<eos> The last thing I remember, there was this girl... and...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Did I?<eos> No, no.<eos> She... she'll live.<eos> We just have to watch her.<eos> Make sure she doesn't Turn.<eos> What are you talking about?

With you.<eos> Yeah, me and... 17,000 other memories.<eos> Look... I am who I am.<eos> And you are who you are.<eos> And all the magic in the world can't change that. So...<eos> let's just try to make the best of it.<eos> Sure.<eos> Make it shine.<eos> I at least thought you'd last till the end of your shift.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?

Clary doesn't have demon blood.<eos> There was a purity trial.<eos> She passed with flying colors.<eos> A purity trial?<eos> - How did you fare?<eos> - I almost died!<eos> I'm sorry, Isabelle.<eos> I had no idea there'd be a purity trial, otherwise I never would have sent you.<eos> How can I believe you?<eos> I wanted you to heal. So you could go on mission to the Iron Sisters, just like you wanted so desperately.

You know that. I already have the Mortal Sword.<eos> The storm is coming whether you like it or not.<eos> Leave my daughter alone.<eos> Hey, did you hear that?<eos> Hear what?<eos> That sound just now.<eos> What sound?<eos> Never mind.<eos> I mean, how would they feel?<eos> Well, I'm glad you didn't ask in front of the sushi chef.
There are things she showed me I didn't know were possible.<eos> So... where is she?<eos> I'm afraid she's a little preoccupied.<eos> Let her go.<eos> This isn't her fight.<eos> It is now.<eos> If Valentine needs lightning to activate the Sword, he probably put Ithuriel up on the rooftop.<eos> Cleophas could have been lying, Clary.<eos> She's not. Not about this.<eos> - How do you know?
Mr. Morgenstern.<eos> What can I help you with?<eos> A potion?<eos> A spell?<eos> I'm very versatile.<eos> In a way that makes my skin crawl.<eos> I thought we would understand each other.<eos> Both scientists in our own right.<eos> I applaud your spirit, but it won't help you.<eos> I hear you've met my daughter, Clarissa?

There has to be something we can do to stop this.<eos> Can't we force Iris to undo it?<eos> I wish it were that easy.<eos> But blood oath spells are completely binding.<eos> Even Iris herself can't reverse it now.<eos> Come in.<eos> Isabelle, you look... recovered. I'm impressed.<eos> It takes most people weeks to wean themselves off yin fen.<eos> Well, I'm not most people.<eos> You wanted to ask me something?
Come in.<eos> Isabelle, you look... recovered. I'm impressed.<eos> It takes most people weeks to wean themselves off yin fen.<eos> Well, I'm not most people.<eos> You wanted to ask me something?<eos> Do you have plans tonight?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I was wondering if you'd like to join me for dinner.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you asking me out?
That is, unless you'd rather I give her the injections.<eos> - No.<eos> - Good. Then I'll leave you two to get acquainted, huh?<eos> Hi, Madzie.<eos> I'm Dot. It's nice to meet you.<eos> You're pretty.<eos> Do you know where Izzy is? I was told you spoke with her this morning.<eos> She hasn't been in the Institute since.<eos> I didn't realize I was the keeper of your sister's calendar.<eos> Something's wrong. She's been acting weird ever since you sent her to the Iron Sisters.
Are you sure this is the park Alec was talking about?<eos> Positive.<eos> See the scorched grass?<eos> Someone opened a Portal.<eos> Nothing over there.<eos> And without the wolves to help us pick up a scent, this is gonna take forever.<eos> We don't have forever. Everyone keep looking.<eos> Maybe he can help.<eos> Excuse me, um... a little girl might have gotten kidnapped a few days ago.<eos> I was wondering if you've seen her.

We gotta move fast.<eos> Fan out.<eos> The initial attacks were in South Brooklyn, so we're gonna focus our search there and then move outward.<eos> Remember, whatever happens, our priority is to locate Clary.<eos> Disregard that order. What the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> Stopping Valentine from destroying the Downworld.<eos> And yet from the look of things, it's the Downworld that's trying to destroy us.<eos> Look, I don't have time to argue.<eos> - Either help me, or get out of the way.<eos> - Or you'll do what?

Supplying yin fen to a subordinate...<eos> An ex-field medic should know better.<eos> And you expect anyone to actually believe this ridiculous accusation?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Idris loves gossip. And you're one Clave investigation away from treating frostbite on Wrangel Island.
Looks like he's already tapping the energy supply.<eos> We need to get to that power core and shut it down.<eos> It'll be heavily guarded.<eos> We'll get to it via the rooftop. Hell if I'm gonna let that bastard destroy the entire downworld.<eos> What, suddenly you care about the downworld?<eos> I'm an officer of the clave,<eos> Sworn to protect downworlders and mundanes alike.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm not the big bad wolf you think I am.<eos> No, you're worse. You got my sister hooked on yin fen.
Sworn to protect downworlders and mundanes alike.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm not the big bad wolf you think I am.<eos> No, you're worse. You got my sister hooked on yin fen.<eos> I warned her, Alec.<eos> Told her of the risks.<eos> But she wanted to visit the Citadel.<eos> The yin fen allowed her to do that.<eos> I was doing her a favor.<eos> Are you kidding me? Look, you might've helped me back there,
Even the sly mouse will walk into a trap If it wants the cheese badly enough.<eos> And you, my friend, you're the cheese.<eos> Oh, don't worry, little one.<eos> It's only a game.<eos> It's make believe, okay?<eos> Take her upstairs.<eos> And don't let anyone in unless her name is Clary.<eos> The power core's up here on the roof, behind this access hatch.<eos> Unfortunately, it's impervious to the unlock rune.<eos> You're the head of the institute. You telling me you don't have a key?
After a year together, I was called to Alicante for a summit.<eos> When I returned, I went to see her and found the aftermath of a massacre.<eos> A shax demon.<eos> I discovered Eva hiding in the basement.<eos> She was in shock, driven mad by grief.<eos> She couldn't control herself, so she transformed.<eos> And attacked me.<eos> She would have killed me if I hadn't used my seraph blade.<eos> Eva died in my arms.<eos> You killed her?
Don't I wish.<eos> Truth Sword, remember?<eos> Please let this work.<eos> Jace, don't!<eos> The mortal cup is still out there.<eos> He's the only one who knows where it is.<eos> You're gonna wish you were dead After the clave gets through with you. Jace.<eos> The Sword's gone.<eos> Valentine morgenstern in the custody of the clave,<eos> Where you will rot for your remaining days. Where is the soul-sword?
Jace, don't!<eos> The mortal cup is still out there.<eos> He's the only one who knows where it is.<eos> You're gonna wish you were dead After the clave gets through with you. Jace.<eos> The Sword's gone.<eos> Valentine morgenstern in the custody of the clave,<eos> Where you will rot for your remaining days. Where is the soul-sword?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Our interrogation techniques have improved since you were one of us.<eos> You can torture me all you want.
I got your back.<eos> Get in here.<eos> Stop it.<eos> - I just...<eos> - No.<eos> Never.<eos> Clary, you ready? Yeah.<eos> - I'll call you tonight?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I could keep going, or you could tell me where you hid the Mortal Cup.
We have no idea if it even exists.<eos> The Clave has no idea about a multitude of things.<eos> Well, this much is certain.<eos> At this point, your only way to avoid execution is hand over the Cup.<eos> Actually, it's quite the opposite.<eos> See, knowing where the Mortal Cup is... that's the only thing that's keeping me alive.<eos> Valentine, you and I both know, the cup can control demons.<eos> In the wrong hands, it could be catastrophic.<eos> In your hands, I'm a dead man.<eos> 19 Shadowhunters died in your assault on this institute, along with hundreds of Downworlders that you massacred with the Soul Sword.

You're Valentine's children.<eos> Tell me what you know.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Haven't we proven ourselves?<eos> Valentine attacked the Institute.<eos> We captured him.<eos> At what cost?<eos> By taking matters into your own hands, you've planted the seeds of rebellion in the Downworld.<eos> The Accords will be near impossible to maintain now.<eos> Fall in line, or you'll end up like Aldertree and Idris facing reprimand.

What's this sand on the floor?<eos> This looks like a demon attack.<eos> I've never seen a demon cause this kind of hemorrhaging.<eos> Is there any security footage?<eos> Nothing in the bar. Maybe<eos> CCTV caught something outside on the street.<eos> We should get them back to the Institute.<eos> Yeah, that's a good idea.<eos> Detective Garroway?<eos> Who are you talking to?

Why would that ruin anything?<eos> Jace, what else are you hiding from me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I swear.<eos> Look, we need to be able to trust each other.<eos> And that means being completely honest, even if the truth hurts.<eos> I get it.<eos> Emotions serve a purpose.<eos> You don't go through what you just went through, witnessing all that death and not feel something, Jace! It's not good for you!<eos> Just feel something. Whether you think it clouds your judgment or not.
Not too spicy.<eos> Will you stop?<eos> Stop!<eos> I'm at work.<eos> Sorry. My girlfriend Samantha.<eos> She was supposed to grab dinner, but...<eos> She... pho-got?<eos> Oh my God.<eos> A joke.<eos> So you are human after all.

You can say that again.<eos> Whoa, hey! Jumpy!<eos> It's just the kayaks, OK?<eos> Yeah, I know, I just...<eos> I always forget.<eos> Damn Raphael!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Looks like Azazel's headed south.<eos> We just recovered four dead mundanes with his signature M.O.<eos> To catch a greater demon you summoned to the Institute, defying all protocol and common sense? Don't put this all on Jace.

Alec, don't!<eos> I got this!<eos> No. No.<eos> No. Are you OK?<eos> Fine.<eos> Why'd you tell me to stop?<eos> I was afraid something terrible would happen.<eos> Something that couldn't be undone.<eos> Hey. You're OK.<eos> - You wanted to see us?
No. No.<eos> No. Are you OK?<eos> Fine.<eos> Why'd you tell me to stop?<eos> I was afraid something terrible would happen.<eos> Something that couldn't be undone.<eos> Hey. You're OK.<eos> - You wanted to see us?<eos> - Yes. I told you I would decide what was next for you once Azazel was vanquished, so here we are.<eos> You can do whatever you want with me, but leave Clary out of this.
Well, that's not possible.<eos> The Clave wants to have you both tested to get a greater understanding of your unique angel-blood abilities.<eos> No, we'll pass on being lab rats.<eos> No, Jace.<eos> I want to do this.<eos> I haven't been able to use my runes since we summoned Azazel.<eos> I... I wanna understand why.<eos> Thank you, Ms. Morgenstern.<eos> Your willingness to put your own comfort aside for the greater good is to be commended.<eos> You would do well to follow her example.
You think if she ever smiled, her face would crack?<eos> Don't be so hard on her.<eos> Can't be easy being a Herondale.<eos> Oh, yeah. I know it must be tough to be like Shadowhunter royalty.<eos> All that power. Prestige.<eos> From what Luke said, she was a very warm person before her son died.<eos> Oh, I have no doubt.<eos> Sun rune.<eos> Try again.<eos> So you've created new runes in the past, and now suddenly, they don't work anymore.

Rosa, meet my friend, Simon.<eos> Hi.<eos> Simon, meet Rosa Santiago.<eos> OK.<eos> Um, I'm all for creative anti-bullying tactics.<eos> But please don't tell me we're here to kidnap Raphael's grandmother.<eos> OK, first of all, she's not his grandmother. She's his sister.<eos> And no one is kidnapping anyone, OK?<eos> Relax.<eos> Who are you again?
It's no use.<eos> I've cloaked myself so no one can see me.<eos> You fool.<eos> You have no idea what you're doing.<eos> After your capture, the Clave hired me to create wards to block Downworlder powers from being used in this cellblock.<eos> Not only can't you break me out, but your cloaking spell won't work here.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> What the hell?<eos> They can see you.<eos> Mr. Bane, what are you doing here?

Brought in on whose authority?<eos> Are you questioning my integrity?<eos> After everything I've done for the Clave?<eos> Your security services are hereby terminated.<eos> Escort Mr. Bane out.<eos> Mama! Mama!<eos> Where is the Mortal Cup?<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> You have to believe me.
Escort Mr. Bane out.<eos> Mama! Mama!<eos> Where is the Mortal Cup?<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> I am Magnus Bane.<eos> Somebody used the Unum ad Unum spell on us.<eos> This has gone far enough.<eos> You're never going to tell me where the Mortal Cup is, are you?
Thank you so much for coming.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Uh, so, what's this surprise you want me to help plan for Alec?<eos> I hope there's liquor involved.<eos> - What's up? - Nothing.<eos> It's just nice being like this.<eos> Like... friends.<eos> It's a shame that it has to end.<eos> What?<eos> You're going to execute Valentine right here in the Institute?
Please, don't...<eos> Please, don't do this!<eos> Please!<eos> My son is dead because of you.<eos> And it's been 23 years, and the pain just never goes away.<eos> Guard the entrance.<eos> Please.<eos> Hello, Alec.<eos> Alec, I'm so sorry.<eos> You were right.

-Absolutely.<eos> -Luke, we need to talk.<eos> A Shadowhunter's been mutilated and killed by a wolf.<eos> -Watch your tone in here.<eos> -How do you know a wolf killed him?<eos> 'Cause of the claw marks and traces of DNA on the body.<eos> The inquisitor would like you to come in.<eos> Just to answer a few questions.<eos> [Luke] Are you questioning me or are you accusing me?<eos> A week ago, you demanded the destruction of the Soul-Sword.

You know, I've been stopped by cops for no other reason than being black, but I thought the Shadowhunters were more evolved than that.<eos> Jace, I didn't do this.<eos> Six Shadowhunters are dead.<eos> Don't let your emotions cloud your judgment.<eos> Isn't fear an emotion?<eos> Because that's all this is.<eos> Tracking people because of the kind of blood they have.<eos> Locking them up without recourse?<eos> Is that what the Clave stands for?<eos> Your idealism is charming, but when they wheel in the next dead Shadowhunter with their runes carved out, what will you tell their family?
He traded his life for ours.<eos> He was a hero.<eos> Leonard.<eos> I must be losing my mind.<eos> You're not riding ahead, Mick. That's why I'm here...<eos> To set you straight.<eos> The amulet. Why is it so important?<eos> Hand over the box.<eos> I swiped it off Darhk.<eos> You have something we need. I would like to
The amulet. Why is it so important?<eos> Hand over the box.<eos> I swiped it off Darhk.<eos> You have something we need. I would like to<eos> - broker a deal with you. - How did you manage<eos> - to defeat him?<eos> - I gave him the amulet.<eos> It's a compass.<eos> Compasses generally find things.<eos> Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?
What is that, Captain?<eos> There are some things, Gideon, I can't even tell you.<eos> Initiate repair procedures.<eos> Auto-repair engaged.<eos> Shogun Ballistic.<eos> Captain, that is the shut down code for my primary syst...<eos> Angels and ministers of grace... defend us...<eos> You're my best friend.<eos> I love you, man.<eos> What did you hear?

- You got that? - Yes.<eos> You got that?<eos> Nate. - Nate.<eos> - Nate!<eos> Sorry, guys.<eos> It helps me concentrate.<eos> It's 3:00 in the morning.<eos> Amaya and I were trying to sleep.<eos> Not together.<eos> - What are you doing up so late?
Not together.<eos> - What are you doing up so late?<eos> - Just trying to figure out what the Legion of Doom wants with those two amulets.<eos> The "Legion of Doom"?<eos> Darhk, Merlyn, and the Speedster.<eos> It's from a Hanna-Barbera cartoon I liked when I was a kid.<eos> Sorry I woke you guys up.<eos> - We... We weren't together.<eos> - He knows, Ray. Yeah.<eos> Well, have you figured anything out?
- I may need to recast. - No, no, no.<eos> You don't have time to recast, okay?<eos> Your thesis film is due in less than a month.<eos> I know, I know, but a film is only as good as its villain, and I have an antagonist who is as threatening as a wiener dog.<eos> Rip Hunter.<eos> No, I'm the director. Rip's being played by Adam Glassman.<eos> He's probably at craft services.<eos> It's nice to see your reputation for dry humor is well-earned.<eos> You see, this is what I am talking about.<eos> You guys are good.
Get Rip out of here.<eos> Hey, come on, we gotta go.<eos> Get... away... from... me.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> Fall back.<eos> - Stay right there! - Hands!<eos> Hands!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Don't move! - Hey.<eos> - Whoa, where do you think - you're going?
What the hell, man?<eos> Fall back.<eos> - Stay right there! - Hands!<eos> Hands!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Don't move! - Hey.<eos> - Whoa, where do you think - you're going?<eos> - Uh, my movie's inside.<eos> - These lunatics just showed up.<eos> - Do you know these people?
We gotta bust him out of jail before they get to him first.<eos> And ever since, I've had... the fear of giant toads.<eos> Mr. Rory, while I appreciate the thoroughness of insights, perhaps we could focus on the issue at hand.<eos> I thought shrinks liked mommy talk.<eos> I'm not a shr...<eos> You know, I think I've heard enough on that subject.<eos> Now, when did you first encounter the apparition?<eos> The ghost of Mr. Snart, when did he first appear?<eos> Back in Chicago.<eos> Can you remember anything specific?
Why do you think he'd say that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe he's...<eos> Captain, hello.<eos> How... What can we do for you?<eos> It's Rip.<eos> Here's here in 1967.<eos> That's astonishing.<eos> How?<eos> We don't know, but Damien Darhk and Malcolm Merlyn are after him, which means you two cannot sit this one out.

I have a very bad headache.<eos> Well, you're gonna have to suck it up, 'cause I need your help breaking Rip out of jail.<eos> What's he doing in prison? And how do you plan on breaking him out?

According to his mug shot, he was booked as "Phil Gasmer""<eos> Phillip Gasmer.<eos> It's imperative that he be released into my custody immediately.<eos> He suffers from delusions of being pursued by futuristic spacemen.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> That guy.<eos> Astonishing.<eos> It's really you.<eos> Yeah, it's me.<eos> Who are you?
- She does?<eos> - I do. - Huh.<eos> Where to, Cap?<eos> All right, we're here.<eos> Get to the cargo bay.<eos> Ray, do not crash my ship.<eos> You break it, you buy it.<eos> - Get away from me.<eos> - Captain Hunter, - you must listen to us.<eos> - Why do you keep calling me that?

A piece of wood approximately 0.6 meters long.<eos> A piece of wood?<eos> - The Spear of Destiny?<eos> - Could be.<eos> I'm gonna go tell the others.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> So this would be a new milestone for you then.<eos> What's your idea?<eos> Why don't we use that thing to see what's up with my brain?<eos> I doubt you'd find the results you're hoping for.

- Well, let's go inspire him.<eos> - Guys, maybe I should do the...<eos> Hey, George.<eos> Remember us?<eos> - Hey! - I had metallic skin.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - Hey...<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> - Look, time takes time to harden, and sooner or later, we're gonna lose our superpowers the same way we're losing our memories.<eos> If you don't make the movies that you make, I don't become a brilliant inventor.
- Hey...<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> - Look, time takes time to harden, and sooner or later, we're gonna lose our superpowers the same way we're losing our memories.<eos> If you don't make the movies that you make, I don't become a brilliant inventor.<eos> And I don't become an incredibly handsome historian.<eos> I haven't made any movies yet, okay?<eos> I'm still in film school.<eos> Or I was.<eos> That's the point.<eos> If you don't go back to school, you screw up both of our lives.
And I do not want to be a heart surgeon.<eos> And I don't want to be a yoga instructor.<eos> Okay, guys, like I said, why don't I talk to - our time aberration?<eos> - Yeah, but... - Shh.<eos> - Stay in school.<eos> I'm sorry about my friends, they're just...<eos> - Completely insane?<eos> - Yeah. But what they say is true.<eos> Oh, okay, what...<eos> What that you guys are from the future, that you've somehow seen a bunch of movies that I haven't even made yet?
- Stay in school.<eos> I'm sorry about my friends, they're just...<eos> - Completely insane?<eos> - Yeah. But what they say is true.<eos> Oh, okay, what...<eos> What that you guys are from the future, that you've somehow seen a bunch of movies that I haven't even made yet?<eos> Well, actually, I'm from the past, but that's beside the point.<eos> Look, George, I don't care about movies, but guys like them?<eos> They do.<eos> So before you get in that car and drive back to Modesto, just think about them, okay?
Them, and all the millions of other people that your stories will someday inspire.<eos> The future of the entire world is at stake.<eos> And you're our only hope.<eos> I've never actually seen your quarters, Mr. Rory.<eos> They're charming.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - What is it?<eos> Something unusual, some sort of receiver.<eos> Judging by its design, one sensitive to gravitation-wave transmissions.<eos> You're telling me I have an antenna in my head.

- You're an idiot.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> It didn't have to end like this.<eos> - Mr. Snart, is he here?<eos> - "Why am I here"?<eos> Why are you here?<eos> You're dead.<eos> What's he saying?<eos> He's telling me I've gone soft because I'm still on the ship.<eos> Doc, Doc... you gotta get this thing out of my head.
As I explained, I'm not a medical doctor...<eos> But I'm sure Gideon and I can figure something out.<eos> - That could work?<eos> Groovy office.<eos> It used to be yours.<eos> Come on, none of this is bringing back - any memories for you?<eos> - Listen, lady,<eos> I-I wish that I could be the guy you want me to be.<eos> "Rip," but I am not.<eos> I take it you two were... pretty tight?

A female hero?<eos> Get with the times, lady.<eos> Yo, we're all in this movie.<eos> I mean, it's different versions of us, but this is definitely the team.<eos> Like on, uh, page 89, my character, Max, - he saves everybody...<eos> - Hold on.<eos> You're telling me that this burnout used repressed memories - to write a screenplay?<eos> - That's not all.<eos> He's writing about the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Which you had with you when you time-jumped - off the Waverider.

- Yes, you do.<eos> - Come on, now. - What?<eos> I just made it all up.<eos> The spear is the MacGuffin.<eos> The what?<eos> The thing in the movie that everyone's trying to get.<eos> - Well, where is it?<eos> - In the movie? It... It's in pieces.<eos> Rip just has a fragment of it.<eos> What inspired you to write it that way?
Rip just has a fragment of it.<eos> What inspired you to write it that way?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just had this old piece of wood.<eos> I thought it'd be a cool movie prop.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - Uh, I gave it<eos> - to my prop master, George.<eos> George Lucas has the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Glad you changed your mind, George Lucas.

Definitely the right call.<eos> We agree.<eos> One of the lost totems of Zambesi, right?<eos> Ah, Mr. Lucas, you have something that we have traveled a very long way to find.
- He was talking.<eos> - Up. Hands.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - They're up.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I don't think it's here.<eos> All right, Spec-y four-eyes. I'm starting to lose my patience with you.<eos> Where is the spear?<eos> What spear?<eos> We had a little chat with the members of your film crew, and they all claimed the Spear of Destiny was a prop, and that you, Mr. Lucas, were its master.
They were just trash.<eos> But, but, but...<eos> Shh.<eos> I have one question for you, Mr. Lucas, and your life depends on answering me honestly.<eos> Where's the city dump?<eos> Gideon, set us down as close to the location as you can get.<eos> Yes, Captain Lance.<eos> And, while you're at it, find Mick and...<eos> Grey?<eos> What the hell are you doing?

'Cause you'll never find it.

I'm afraid not, Captain.<eos> Would you stop calling me that, please?<eos> I am not a captain. I'm just a regular guy.<eos> So was Captain Hunter.<eos> He had no superpowers, unless you count his courage, intellect, and honor.<eos> Well, what would he do, huh? Your Captain, if he were here?<eos> You guys, we... we have to give it them.<eos> - There's no other way.<eos> - There is.<eos> You have to become a filmmaker.

And yet, never late.<eos> So who do we kill first?<eos> That would be me.<eos> Captain Rip Hunter.<eos> It's been ages.<eos> I was beginning to think you were dead.
The Legion have nothing.<eos> We lost him, Jax.<eos> Again.<eos> But they won't have him for long.<eos> If I know one thing about you, it's that you don't give up.<eos> When you really want something, you are unstoppable, and God help anybody that tries to get in your way.<eos> We are gonna find him, and we're gonna bring him home.<eos> Is that a promise?<eos> That's a prophecy.<eos> How are you feeling?

Hah, I've almost forgotten how to perform a median sternotomy.<eos> Well, I guess I'll just go back to being a billionaire inventor with four PhDs.<eos> So what are we gonna watch first?<eos> I mean, after we watch "Raiders." - Clearly his best film.<eos> - Which he never would've made if he hadn't made "Star Wars" first.<eos> Oh, wait, this one sounds cute.<eos> It's called "Howard the Duck""<eos> No!<eos> Okay, maybe movie night wasn't such a good idea.<eos> Maybe you're right.

- Then "Empire."<eos> - Then "Last Crusade."<eos> Get comfy.<eos> It's gonna be a long night.<eos> Uh... hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Is anybody there?<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Welcome, Captain Hunter.<eos> You know I was bluffing, right?
Uh... hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Is anybody there?<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Welcome, Captain Hunter.<eos> You know I was bluffing, right?<eos> I am not actually Rip Hunter.<eos> I am a full-time film student and part-time recreational drug user.<eos> Seriously regretting the latter.<eos> Oh, I know exactly who you are.

My name is Damien Darhk.<eos> In 2016, I was murdered by the Green Arrow.<eos> But I was removed from the timeline 31 years before my death by a speedster from the future named Eobard Thawne.<eos> Together, with Malcolm Merlyn, a former head of the League of Assassins, the three of us are going to locate the Spear of Destiny; a mystical object which can rewrite reality itself.<eos> With the Spear in our possession, we will change our past and our future. And the world as you know it.<eos> Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...<eos> A deep scan reveals that Captain Hunter's neural architecture has been reprogrammed with a new identity.<eos> The Longinus Medallion.<eos> Rip!<eos> I know that you're one of the protectors of the Spear of Destiny and I know that you know where the other pieces are hidden.

This is the great Malcolm Merlyn?<eos> I am unimpressed.<eos> Well, he's fallen on hard times.<eos> But this man used to be Ra's al Ghul.<eos> I'm Eobard Thawne.<eos> I'm... from the future.<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> Excellent question.<eos> Here's another...<eos> Do you believe in second chances?

But the question for you, Malcolm, is: Do you wish to see your fortunes similarly reversed?<eos> By time travel?<eos> No. No.<eos> Something much better.<eos> - Well?<eos> - No luck. So far.<eos> It's not that Captain Hunter's uncooperative. It's that he's not fully in possession of his marbles.<eos> So he won't tell us where the rest of the Spear of Destiny is?<eos> Uh, it's more like... can't.<eos> Which wouldn't be such a problem if you two idiots hadn't lost the Longinus Medallion.

Yeah, Mick. Given your glass house, you shouldn't throw stones.<eos> Mixing metaphors isn't going to solve anything.<eos> How about instead of bickering, we figure out our next move against the speedster and his allies.<eos> "Legion of Doom" has a sexier ring to it.<eos> I'm not calling them that.<eos> And we need to figure out a way to rescue Rip.<eos> All you gotta do is trade the Amulet, or the Medallion, for the Englishman.<eos> It's really simple.<eos> The only thing is, I don't know how it works.<eos> You're an idiot.
Jax, stick with Martin.<eos> And let's work on putting a name to our speedster.<eos> Aww, here comes a man who looks like he just struck out.<eos> Don't get smug with me, Damien.<eos> I may not have all my prior resources, but at least I'm not dead.<eos> Look, I couldn't get Hunter to remember because his memories aren't buried or locked away.<eos> They're gone.<eos> It's like his old self didn't exist.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> Do you think you can do any better?

We already tried torture.<eos> You know what I love about torture?<eos> I'm not sure if you have enough time for me to list all the reasons, but mainly it's because there's always another gear to find.<eos> This is what I get for relying on a washout and a dead man.<eos> Hmm, you know. I'll be honest.<eos> Which I have to admit, I don't have much practice in.<eos> I don't like this situation.<eos> Not one bit.<eos> For one thing, Mr. Thawne has this habit of treating me like a henchman.<eos> And do you know what all henchmen have in common, Captain Hunter?
Which I have to admit, I don't have much practice in.<eos> I don't like this situation.<eos> Not one bit.<eos> For one thing, Mr. Thawne has this habit of treating me like a henchman.<eos> And do you know what all henchmen have in common, Captain Hunter?<eos> No thoughts on this one?<eos> The thing that all henchmen have in common is that they all end up dead.<eos> A fate that I am fastidiously trying to avoid.<eos> Maybe it's that I just hate taking orders. Or being threatened.<eos> You don't like being threatened, do you?
I can't take your word for it.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> I will start you off with an easy question.<eos> Right eye or left eye? No, please.<eos> Please, don't.<eos> I'll do anything, I'll...<eos> I'll tell you anything you want to know. Even if I don't know it!<eos> - Please, don't! - Shh.<eos> Second question.<eos> When was the last time you had any dental work done?
I'll do anything, I'll...<eos> I'll tell you anything you want to know. Even if I don't know it!<eos> - Please, don't! - Shh.<eos> Second question.<eos> When was the last time you had any dental work done?<eos> What?<eos> No, no, God.<eos> It may not be in the best condition, but then again,<eos> Captain Hunter is British.<eos> You pulled out his tooth?
A Time Master.<eos> That's no ordinary security box.<eos> My thinking exactly.<eos> Now, it's possible the box could contain his son's birth certificate and the like, but...<eos> Given the exotic nature of the care that's been taken here,<eos> I would have to assume...<eos> - It's the rest of the Spear.<eos> When was it last accessed?<eos> January 2025.<eos> Oh, you got somewhere to go?
Is that an ionic transmographer?<eos> I've never seen one smaller than a house!<eos> Yeah, I had an idea for hyperminiaturization when I was in Tahiti.<eos> I don't vacation well.<eos> You know, I'm thinking a shortwave ionic pulse might...<eos> Hey.<eos> Perhaps we should, uh, take our little research project somewhere a bit more private...<eos> A temporal navigation vessel. I...<eos> I absolutely cannot believe it.<eos> Um, hello, who are you? Oh, hi.

To not use him is foolish. Oh.<eos> Well, in that case, I would have to defer to your superior expertise in foolishness.<eos> But if your plan goes south, it's not our speedster friend you need to worry about.<eos> One thing I hate more than taking orders from him... is being threatened by you.<eos> Luckily, Damien... I don't find you threatening.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> The professor didn't have a kid, now he does.<eos> Mazel tov.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The big deal is Lily is a Time Aberration, which was all well and good, until you plucked her out of 2016 and showed her a timeship, which could cause more aberrations.

Fine.<eos> Then I would appreciate it if you...<eos> If none of you would reveal to her that she's an Aberration.<eos> Why you looking at me?<eos> So where are we on identifying the speedster?<eos> I think the technical term is nowhere.<eos> All the speedsters the Flash faced are either dead or his friends.<eos> Or people he thought were his friends and are now dead.<eos> Okay, we will figure this out.<eos> And in the meantime, you and Lily keep working with the amulet to figure out to figure out where the rest of the Spear is.
This monkey suit.<eos> And my mouth is so sore.<eos> Quit whining.<eos> The fact of the matter is, we have something in common, Rip.<eos> My name is Phil.<eos> Whatever.<eos> We are both dealing with unstable individuals.<eos> And that is not something I enjoy.<eos> Hey, this is not exactly a walk in the park for me, either.<eos> Which is why you will do exactly as I say.

Have you ever been to Switzerland?
Tell me, Phil. Have you ever been to Switzerland?<eos> Put this in your ear.<eos> What is it?<eos> Communication device.<eos> Really?<eos> It's so small...<eos> Do it, or I'll shove it down your throat.<eos> It will allow us to monitor you.<eos> This is very simple.<eos> You go to the bank associate and you tell them you want to access security box 4587.

I'm motivating him.<eos> In and out.<eos> Take no longer than five minutes.<eos> You will be fine.
I'd like box 4587, please.<eos> Well, sure, have a seat.<eos> What do you think's going on with him?<eos> It's simple.<eos> His mind is pudding.<eos> Not Hunter.<eos> Thawne.<eos> It's strange how he never stays in one place for very long...<eos> Perhaps that's why they refer to them as speedsters.<eos> What, you think he left us behind in 1967, Los Angeles, because he had a more pressing engagement?
It's strange how he never stays in one place for very long...<eos> Perhaps that's why they refer to them as speedsters.<eos> What, you think he left us behind in 1967, Los Angeles, because he had a more pressing engagement?<eos> What about what he said to us earlier?<eos> That he wanted to kill one of us?<eos> That he didn't know why he was relying on us.<eos> I mean, fair question.<eos> Why does a time traveling speedster need to rely on anyone?<eos> Thawne's hiding something.<eos> Wouldn't you like to know what it is?
I am not trying to...<eos> In a trio such as ours, turning one against each other for your own benefit is not only obvious, but cliché.<eos> Thawne does not treat us as equals to him.<eos> And until he does, neither of us is getting what he wants.<eos> All right. Let's go over this again.<eos> I already been over it, Sara.<eos> Mm-hmm, again and again.<eos> And again.<eos> We're obviously dealing with a new player.<eos> Whoever this speedster is, it's someone you and your friends haven't encountered before.
Then would the speedster need the Spear of Destiny for?<eos> He could just go back and change history himself.<eos> But not reality.<eos> That's why he needs the Spear.<eos> Question is, what is the speedster trying to change?<eos> Or fix?<eos> That's the question.<eos> He knows what we want to do with the Spear of Destiny, but he's being very coy about his plans.<eos> Very well, Mr. Hunter.<eos> Please lean towards the panel, if you would.
- Rectal scanner?<eos> - What?<eos> It's an eye scan.<eos> Part of the bank's security.<eos> You know, this whole situation sucks, but man, I love being in the future.<eos> - What?<eos> Retinal scan.<eos> Why, uh... Why is it not working?<eos> Voice ID is next.<eos> You need to speak your access code.

Move.<eos> Don't.<eos> This was your plan.<eos> Which I am trying to execute.<eos> And failing spectacularly, per usual.<eos> Look, we can't just let them call security.<eos> I am calling security.<eos> Great idea. Security, no, that's...<eos> Security is awesome.<eos> You aren't planning on going rogue on us, now, were you, Rip?
I have told you. My name is Phil.<eos> All right, Phil.<eos> It was lovely knowing you.<eos> Don't!<eos> We still need him.<eos> He's useless to us.<eos> Hey, I can be more useful.<eos> Ah, damn it.<eos> Security is gonna be on top of us at any moment.<eos> Might I suggest you kill them instead?

Okay, that should just about do it.<eos> And now we just have to activate the Medallion and see if Gideon can access its data.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what are we waiting for?<eos> Nothing, it... It's just if...<eos> If we've underestimated the size of the artifact's data stream...<eos> We'll fry the ship's CPU and we'll all spend the rest of our lives stranded in the Temporal Zone.<eos> The ship's CPU has a name.<eos> Sorry, Gideon.<eos> Can we at least talk about this before you connect...
It's completely synthetic.<eos> The food fabricator can make anything.<eos> Except American Cheese, which is pretty much synthetic to being with.<eos> Beluga caviar?<eos> Fake food never tasted so good.<eos> Fake food for a fake person.<eos> What did you say?<eos> He didn't say anything.<eos> Everyone has been looking at me weird ever since I came on board this ship.<eos> What are you not telling me?

Aberration!<eos> You're a Time Aberration.<eos> You're a Time Aberration.<eos> Ray?<eos> What is a Time Aberration?<eos> Um, I think maybe you should talk to your dad.<eos> Perhaps we could all just talk about what went wrong. - Shh!<eos> - Oh, I know what went wrong.<eos> I listened to him.<eos> If you'd have listened to me, we would have walked out of that bank instead of being chased out.

Actually, it's quite fascinating.<eos> This is not fascinating, Dad!<eos> This is a nightmare.<eos> Oh, Lily, I'm so sorry.<eos> This is not how I wanted you to find out.<eos> No.<eos> No, I get it.<eos> You didn't want kids when you first came on board this timeship.<eos> And now you have me.<eos> You just reminded me of something.
For his underlings to be at one another's throats.<eos> Like, literally.<eos> He is not our boss.<eos> Did he call us underlings?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. Uh...<eos> Henchmen.<eos> Try again.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> What if he's right?<eos> You actually care what this pudding-brained hippie has to say?
What if he's right?<eos> You actually care what this pudding-brained hippie has to say?<eos> It's just like the movie âThe Good, the Bad, and the Uglyâ<eos> Three bad guys. No one knows who to trust. So they all end up screwing each other over.<eos> It's an interesting theory.<eos> Which one are we?<eos> The point is that neither of you are Clint Eastwood and so neither of you end up going home with the gold.<eos> We're not after the gold.<eos> Yeah, I know, I know.<eos> I know what you're after.

Just tell her you love her.<eos> That's what dads do.<eos> Clearly, you never met my father.<eos> You know, the...<eos> The reason Clarissa and I chose not to have children the first time around was because...<eos> I feared that history would repeat itself, that I would be the kind of father that he was.<eos> We're legends, Grey.<eos> Changing history is what we do.<eos> Why would a speedster need to change reality? Ohh.<eos> How many times are you gonna ask that question?
Who what?<eos> Thawne was erased from existence when his progenitor,<eos> Eddie Thawne, committed suicide in order to stop him.<eos> Which would explain why the Time Masters didn't have a file on him.<eos> But if Thawne doesn't exist, then how?<eos> He was protected from his ancestor's death because he was a member of the Speed Force.<eos> It's a little complicated.<eos> A little?<eos> Oh, and for the record, this is how I wanted to approach things in the first place.<eos> Only because you enjoy killing a lot of people.

All right, that's pretty impressive, Malcolm.<eos> But how did you get Hunter's passcode?<eos> It's not Hunter's.<eos> It's the bank manager's security override code.<eos> It only cost him three fingers.<eos> Uh, yes!<eos> Going somewhere?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> What do you expect me to do?
Going somewhere?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> What do you expect me to do?<eos> Your partners just left me here all tied up.<eos> Where are they?<eos> They... told me... Not to tell you.<eos> The bank. They're...<eos> They're at the bank.<eos> Look, you could help yourself to... to whatever is in that safe deposit box, but please...
By all means, Dr. Heywood, please enlighten us. Okay.<eos> What if Thawne isn't just chasing us?<eos> What if he's running from something?<eos> But running from what?<eos> Time.<eos> Time takes time to harden.<eos> And if Thawne ceased to exist the moment his great-great-whatever killed himself, then, maybe, he has to keep moving in order for his own nonexistence not to catch up with him. Poo!<eos> That doesn't even begin to make any kind of sense.<eos> I don't know, it could work.<eos> Professor, what do you think?

A what?<eos> A thing.<eos> What thing?<eos> Can you be a little more specific?<eos> My ancestor killed himself in an effort to erase my very existence.<eos> Well, you look pretty spry despite it.
My ancestor killed himself in an effort to erase my very existence.<eos> Well, you look pretty spry despite it.<eos> The Flash pulled me from the timeline.<eos> He held me captive for months and when I finally got loose,<eos> I found myself... pursued by something.<eos> I-I thought it was a time wraith, the monsters that hunt speedsters who mess with time.<eos> But, whatever is hunting me is... far worse than a time wraith.<eos> It can sense the Speed Force.<eos> And it's trying to kill me.<eos> Interestin... so that's why you keep running out on us.

You're sure you can't stay? I...<eos> I would. I just, um...<eos> I'm working on a series of synthetic proteins that are not gonna fold themselves, so...<eos> So then, I guess this is good-bye.<eos> Good luck folding those proteins.<eos> Good luck rescuing your friend, Rip. Hm.<eos> Bye, Dad.<eos> Feel no pressure to tell us what all this techno-crap is about.<eos> We're sure we can figure it out ourselves.<eos> This, uh, techno-crap, as you so eloquently put it, is Captain Hunter's memories.
No problem.<eos> I wanted to talk with you, as well.<eos> Ok. The file that I sent you.<eos> John Diggle is my former bodyguard and current friend.<eos> And facing a court-martial for espionage, murder, escaping a federal prison, and attempted theft of a WMD.<eos> He's innocent.<eos> So why did he escape a federal prison?<eos> Because he's innocent.<eos> The man who framed him is a 3-star general.<eos> John did not think that he would get a fair trial in the court system, which is where you come in.
John Diggle is a good man.<eos> He's better than the both of us put together.<eos> Getting the Judge Advocates to even to authorize me to pro hoc in would be a miracle.<eos> Sounds like a yes?<eos> More like a "God help me" and your friend.<eos> Hey.<eos> I will owe you one.<eos> This is worth more than one.<eos> Um, actually, hey.<eos> As if we don't have enough on our plate, have you heard about the circumstances surrounding the death of Detective Malone?
Hey.<eos> I will owe you one.<eos> This is worth more than one.<eos> Um, actually, hey.<eos> As if we don't have enough on our plate, have you heard about the circumstances surrounding the death of Detective Malone?<eos> No.<eos> He was wearing Prometheus' outfit when he was killed.<eos> His mouth was taped shut, a sword taped into his hand.<eos> There was a wireless speaker found on the scene.<eos> What are you saying?
No.<eos> He was wearing Prometheus' outfit when he was killed.<eos> His mouth was taped shut, a sword taped into his hand.<eos> There was a wireless speaker found on the scene.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> That it looks like Malone was set up, that it looks like the Green Arrow was manipulated into killing him.<eos> By Prometheus?<eos> I made sure the cops who caught the scene won't say anything, and I'm handling the coroner.<eos> I just wanted to let you know.<eos> Yeah, that you're gonna... Cover this up.
And... and I kind of have to now... Then I need to believe that differences are caused by circumstances, so why can't we change this Laurel's circumstances?<eos> You think that you can save her?<eos> After she's thrown in with Prometheus? Under duress.<eos> I...<eos> I think I can reach her.<eos> When did you find the time to get a Ph.D. in psychology?<eos> I'm a quick study.<eos> My name's Adrian Chase, Star City district attorney.<eos> John Diggle, convict.<eos> You here to add to my charges?
I'm a quick study.<eos> My name's Adrian Chase, Star City district attorney.<eos> John Diggle, convict.<eos> You here to add to my charges?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> I'm representing you.<eos> Your friend Oliver's persuasive, plus he's my boss.<eos> Heh. General Walker, the guy who wants you out of the picture, you know who his boss is?<eos> The President.<eos> So you can imagine how difficult this is about to be.

Mr. Chase, MP officers are here to remand the prisoner into their custody.<eos> Wait.<eos> I thought I was supposed to stay here for now.<eos> You're under their jurisdiction. - The trial...<eos> - The trial?<eos> Man, there won't be a trial.<eos> As soon as I'm out of here, Walker will concoct some reason to put a bullet in my head.<eos> Sergeant Diggle.<eos> Heh.<eos> Good to see you again. Have Sergeant Diggle cleared out of here and ready for transport ASAP.
So I was trying to see if there's a way to make the dampener portable so next time we go up against her...<eos> You can take her powers away.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Yeah. Well, ideas are one thing.<eos> Executing them is another.<eos> - You don't get it, do you?<eos> - Get what?<eos> That maybe instead of beating yourself up about what you can't do, take a moment and appreciate what you can do because it's pretty badass.<eos> General Walker.<eos> Sorry, General, but I cannot let you take John Diggle without the proper paperwork turned in.
Felicity can come with and help you.<eos> Not getting a good enough reading off the thermal imaging. There's no way to tell if Black Siren is actually with Prometheus, and the whole point of doing this is to catch that son of a...<eos> Bitch.<eos> We need to wait till we get visual confirmation on Prometheus.<eos> We're not waiting for anything.<eos> We're gonna bring her in right now.<eos> Get on board with this.<eos> Suit up.<eos> This is private property.<eos> Ma'am, what are you doing here?
There's no coming back for you.<eos> If you kill Felicity, then you're killing that part of yourself that existed before you lost your family.<eos> If you end this now, then we can find that person again...<eos> Together.<eos> She was never there.<eos> You really need to shut your damn mouth.<eos> Hey, pumpkin.<eos> Hey.<eos> Kept my wrist straight.<eos> You turn me over, I'll be dead before you get back to your office.

Gentlemen, sorry I'm late.<eos> How you holding up?<eos> Well, Walker's gonna have custody of me in a week, so... Wow.<eos> As soon as Walker gets his hands on John, he's gonna throw him into a hole.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> I've got a buddy at the National Security Agency.<eos> Turns out they have general Walker under investigation and were putting together quite the case...<eos> Wire transfers and some keyhole satellite images of his movements with the nuclear trigger.<eos> That's enough to exonerate John.<eos> Except I don't like the way you just said, "were..."
Except I don't like the way you just said, "were..."<eos> "Building a case" just now.<eos> Walker has friends in high places.<eos> Managed to get the investigation slow-rolled.<eos> But the file still exists.<eos> I made a foia request, but seeing as all this is classified, that could take months, maybe even years.<eos> That's time we don't have.<eos> I'm sorry I don't have better news.<eos> No, Adrian.<eos> You have gone above and beyond already.
Our screaming Sonic lady has a name... Tina Boland, formerly of the CCPD.<eos> That tracks. She was in central city when the particle accelerator exploded.<eos> After that, she went off the grid, which means that we have no way of finding her.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Captain Singh.<eos> I need information.<eos> Who is this?<eos> It's the Green Arrow.<eos> Or some nut job with a voice modulator.<eos> You want help, I'm gonna need proof.

Fine.<eos> What do you want to know?
She was CCPD.<eos> - What happened to her?<eos> - Nothing but tragedy there.<eos> She went deep undercover, and her partner got killed in action.<eos> Her partner's name was...<eos> Vincent sobel.<eos> Tina quit the force the day after his funeral, and we haven't heard from her since.<eos> She in some kind of trouble?<eos> Not sure yet.<eos> You get anything, give me a call.
It's Mandarin for Purgatory.<eos> What brought you back to the island?<eos> Like I said...<eos> I need your help.<eos> What the hell's going on here?<eos> We have a problem, and I need you to get off the island.<eos> I'm not going anywhere. - Neither is he.<eos> - I'm taking him, and I'm taking Digger Harkness.<eos> There's an Argus supply boat that is docked on the eastern shore.<eos> You take it, and you go.
Damn right I don't.<eos> I do not want to rely on Slade Wilson.<eos> There's nothing about the situation that's ideal, Thea.<eos> I need your help, Speedy, and this is how you help me.<eos> - Ok.<eos> - Ok.<eos> My sister and Harkness fled into the forest, but... I can track them.<eos> They might lead us back to the rest of the hostages.<eos> They're our friends, and we don't need your help.<eos> I see you haven't lost your feistiness, Ms. Smoak.
She's asleep.<eos> We're good.<eos> Mm, hey baby, mm...<eos> Keep going.<eos> Don't touch me.<eos> Don't touch.<eos> I know exactly what I want.<eos> I felt alone... outside myself.<eos> And when I woke up, I was turned on.<eos> And whether asleep or trying to, um... you know,
And when I woke up, I was turned on.<eos> And whether asleep or trying to, um... you know,<eos> my mind only goes to her.<eos> You know, I try to think of other things.<eos> Like, there's this anchor on CNN.<eos> Or Emily, my ex before Sidney, one time, in Mexico, in this public hot tub.<eos> But they're always replaced by Sidney.<eos> It doesn't matter how the fantasy begins. It only ends with her.<eos> Sometimes when we try to avoid thinking about something, the more it gets into our head.<eos> So if I tell you not to think of a red apple, what do you think of?

You can't allow Sidney to have that kind of power over you.<eos> Positive or negative, you're finding a way to fixate on her.<eos> Both of us, in our sessions, we're giving it way too much weight.<eos> I know. I agree, but I just... I don't know how to keep my mind from going there.<eos> Let's talk about Emily.<eos> What was she like?<eos> Stable and healthy, not at all adventurous.<eos> But I think that's why I found Sidney so alluring, because she was the exact opposite.<eos> Right, but she's also selfish and dangerous.<eos> From what you said.
By the way, you haven't told me if you're coming tomorrow.<eos> Sorry, a capella practice.<eos> I can't believe that's not a joke.<eos> Wait till you see us perform.<eos> It's like Pitch Perfect on crack.<eos> It's nice to have a community, though.<eos> It's different to go through life alone, you know?<eos> Yeah, well, I'm just happy you found your voice.<eos> "Dear Jean, I thought a lot about my outburst the other day, about ending therapy.<eos> And what I'm trying to say is maybe you don't see me for who I really am.

I know we're not friends, but I really value our relationship, Jean, and I'm hurt."<eos> That's it.<eos> - It's a wonderful letter.<eos> - Really?<eos> I was so nervous on the train coming here.<eos> I kept debating about this Cowardly Lion part,<eos> I thought maybe it was too much.<eos> And I, uh, I thought maybe I shouldn't use any metaphors.<eos> No, it's great, really.<eos> And not only because I want you to be open with me, but because it's exactly what I want you to share with Rebecca.

Rebecca lost her dad.

Rebecca lost her dad.<eos> And I have a feeling that maybe... maybe there wasn't enough room for her grief with yours.<eos> Now, I know how complex the mother-daughter relationship can be, but as the mother, you sometimes have to take responsibility.<eos> You don't want it to get so bad that she doesn't return your calls or do anything real with you.

I don't usually disclose, but she's spirited.<eos> Has a mind of her own.<eos> She's actually having a birthday this weekend.<eos> Oh, how nice.<eos> What are you planning?

- Got it.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Oh, and a Katherine Wallace called.<eos> She didn't say what it was about, but she sounded like...<eos> Okay, um, did she leave a number?<eos> Uh, yeah, I put it on your post sheet.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Have a good weekend.<eos> Enjoy the party.<eos> Let me know if there's anything you need.
Thank you, Barry, thank you.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - I'm sorry, too.<eos> It's gorgeous.<eos> I was going to tell her after her party, but, well...<eos> People think being alone is the scariest thing in the world.<eos> They're wrong.<eos> Lying to yourself is far worse.<eos> Happy birthday, Jeanie.<eos> When was the last time you saw her?

It's not real.<eos> Now just go be with your friends.<eos> Go on, enjoy the party.<eos> You're not mad at me anymore?<eos> Oh, honey, no, I'm not mad at you, 'cause you're my girl, right?<eos> And I'd do anything for you.<eos> Give up everything just to make you happy.<eos> Fine, but I wanna do the next trick.<eos> Go on, then.<eos> - Hey! I can't believe you came all the way out here.

- Yeah. Yeah.<eos> - Oh, you were great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Oh, man, thank you.<eos> That's great.<eos> You know, I never wanted Arya to be an actor.<eos> Really?<eos> She's so good.<eos> Oh, she's fucking great.<eos> But even if you're great, are you really gonna be the next Meryl Streep?
I am really sorry about all that craziness that you witnessed this morning.<eos> - That was... You know. - Oh...<eos> No, that's okay.<eos> I understand how that stuff goes.<eos> And I think you should finally know that Steve and I are splitting up.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Yeah. - No, well...<eos> - That's a shame.<eos> I mean, we were not really a great fit.<eos> Ahh, no, I feel like you guys, you know, started dating, you got married, right?
I mean... you know, like, hard.<eos> - And it was... I mean... - Mmm.<eos> - beyond. - Yeah. No, that's romantic.<eos> - And he still does.<eos> That's sweet.<eos> But everything else is a fucking nightmare.<eos> - I mean, you cannot raise a child with a man like that.<eos> - You know?<eos> No. - I imagine not. Uh...<eos> So do you know where Arya went, or...
What's your excuse?<eos> - Fine!<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna go get a job, because it's so freakin' easy to get, right?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> You look so stupid wheeling that thing.<eos> Hey.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yeah, cool store.<eos> I like the stuff you guys sell here.

We just hired someone, so...<eos> Guess you're out of luck.<eos> Can we go, please?<eos> Can I talk to a manager or something?<eos> I'd really like to have a job today, if possible.<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> Um, the manager's not here.<eos> Okay, but she says that there are jobs everywhere.<eos> And, uh, you know, I know a lot about selling stuff, and I'm a great team player.<eos> Do you have any retail experience?
Do you have any retail experience?<eos> I sell my plasma sometimes, so...<eos> Yeah, that doesn't count.<eos> Um, this job is about, um, personality.<eos> Well, I have an awesome personality.<eos> People tell me that all the time.<eos> They say, "Randy, your personality fuckin' rocks!"<eos> Okay.<eos> You made your point, all right?<eos> Okay, can I just leave my e-mail and my name? And then when a job opens up later, you contact me and I come in.
I should be smoking and making out, not standing here with a bunch of 50-year-olds all day.<eos> Hey, Arya. Like him.<eos> Why do I know him?<eos> Okay.<eos> I see where you're coming from.<eos> I get how it'd be a bummer for you, okay?<eos> Nobody cares what I think.<eos> Hey, I care what you feel, okay?<eos> Don't say that.<eos> No, you don't.
Hey!<eos> Uh, Erika's waving at me.<eos> So I gotta go.<eos> Are you gonna be all right?<eos> Yeah, do your thing. Totally.<eos> Don't worry about Gus.<eos> We're gonna take good care of him.<eos> You cool?<eos> - Hi.<eos> Whose list are you on? - Hey.
Whose list are you on? - Hey.<eos> Oh.<eos> Uh, it's Mickey.<eos> She works here.<eos> Yeah, I need a last name.<eos> Ah, shit, I don't remember.<eos> Um, she's, um... she's blonde.<eos> Uh, like, um, really kind of healthy-looking.<eos> Like, I feel like it could be, like, Baker?<eos> Uh, if you could look on there for Baker, or it could easily be Jones, I feel like.
Oh.<eos> Uh, it's Mickey.<eos> She works here.<eos> Yeah, I need a last name.<eos> Ah, shit, I don't remember.<eos> Um, she's, um... she's blonde.<eos> Uh, like, um, really kind of healthy-looking.<eos> Like, I feel like it could be, like, Baker?<eos> Uh, if you could look on there for Baker, or it could easily be Jones, I feel like.<eos> Could you just look in there for Jones?
Uh, it's Mickey.<eos> She works here.<eos> Yeah, I need a last name.<eos> Ah, shit, I don't remember.<eos> Um, she's, um... she's blonde.<eos> Uh, like, um, really kind of healthy-looking.<eos> Like, I feel like it could be, like, Baker?<eos> Uh, if you could look on there for Baker, or it could easily be Jones, I feel like.<eos> Could you just look in there for Jones?<eos> Yeah, you can't just guess all existing names.
Oh, God!<eos> What a fucking Oedipal mess that was.<eos> - That was crazy.<eos> - Yeah, well, you really helped her.<eos> I was listening, and I was like,<eos> "This guy's doing his job."<eos> That's the thing about people.<eos> They gotta realize is that no matter how mundane their lives seem to be, usually they are deeply fucked up.<eos> Which, case in point... Oh.<eos> You from the New York team, or...
That's the thing about people.<eos> They gotta realize is that no matter how mundane their lives seem to be, usually they are deeply fucked up.<eos> Which, case in point... Oh.<eos> You from the New York team, or...<eos> No.<eos> No, no, I'm, uh, somebody's date.<eos> I got to say, it is surreal, like, hearing your voice come out of your mouth.<eos> I know you probably get that, like, all the time, but...<eos> - I hear it here and there.<eos> - Ah, you get it a lot.
Um...<eos> Well, we just wanted to introduce ourselves to you.<eos> I'm Erika, of course.<eos> We've met. We know each other now.<eos> Erika...<eos> Two nephews.<eos> We're just so excited to be part of the Subzero Gravity family.<eos> - I'm gonna go to the bar.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know what I was thinking? You dodged a freaking bullet last week for not being here.
No.<eos> Just interesting.<eos> It's like, I'm German, and I'm Catholic, I'm Midwestern.<eos> It's like a Neapolitan of repression.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, I got to say, it is, like, so refreshing to be able to talk to you this way.<eos> Just, like, talk to a guy in a way that's open and vulnerable and sincere.<eos> It's, uh... it's very rare, you know?<eos> Can I say that?<eos> - Is that... - Yeah, you can and you should.
I mean, who's your waiter?<eos> Never even thought of that.<eos> I can't keep just taking the orders. Sometimes I have to give the orders.<eos> And the orders are the things that make you sad, right?<eos> Well, for being a waiter, the orders are the food.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But... but...<eos> Yeah.<eos> You like truth, don't you, Gus?
You like truth, don't you, Gus?<eos> I like truth. Yeah, truth and honesty are pretty crucial to me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Sincerity, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All that. All that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - So are you in love with her?
Yeah.<eos> - So are you in love with her?<eos> - Who, Mickey?<eos> I mean, if you feel uncomfortable with this, I don't need to press.<eos> We can either talk about it, or we can change the subject.<eos> No, no. Wow.<eos> I guess... you know, we haven't known each other very long, but I do...<eos> I really like her.<eos> Like, really, really like her.<eos> Because you know her so well?
I guess... you know, we haven't known each other very long, but I do...<eos> I really like her.<eos> Like, really, really like her.<eos> Because you know her so well?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What...<eos> - Did your tone just change?<eos> Uh... - Did my tone just change?<eos> I feel like your tone changed.<eos> - Really? That's what you think?
What...<eos> - Did your tone just change?<eos> Uh... - Did my tone just change?<eos> I feel like your tone changed.<eos> - Really? That's what you think?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, there was definitely a tone change.<eos> - That's very perceptive, Gus. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> And that's one of the things I like about you.<eos> - How perceptive you are.
I fucked her, Gus.<eos> I fucked Mickey.<eos> I fucked her against her dresser.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's enough.<eos> The point is she's a fucking user, Gus.<eos> Mickey used me to keep her job.<eos> She is using you.<eos> She doesn't like you.<eos> You're just another schmuck in a... in a long line of schmucks that she sleeps with to make her feel like her life means something.

This dog goes crazy.<eos> Starts barking and whimpering and immediately takes a dump... - Oh, my God.<eos> - on the floor. - No!<eos> - It smells disgusting.<eos> I mean, they clean it up, but for five full hours, I am in dog shit hell.<eos> People start looking at me like it's my dog.<eos> - That's awful!<eos> - And I'm saying, "Hey," you know, "Do I look like I'm a fucking bichon owner to you?"<eos> No.<eos> You don't.

- Ah... - No!<eos> Hey, well, that's great!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> Good for you, Micks.<eos> Got yourself a nice, hardworking guy with no tattoos or piercings.<eos> I had a feeling you two would get along.<eos> Better than the last guy.<eos> Remember when he fell asleep at the table?<eos> Have you decided?

Oh, well, Southwest doesn't fly direct to San Francisco from where I live.<eos> But I'm heading up to Palo Alto.<eos> Got a meeting with an investor I think is going to help me out with this new app I've got.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> What's the... what's the idea?<eos> It's like Uber, but better.<eos> You know, it's the better Uber.<eos> These things are all about right place, right time.<eos> I mean, I've had guys rip me off, make money off my ideas, but that is not gonna happen this time.<eos> Well, uh, I just wanna say, we're so glad to have you in town and, uh, maybe I'll get to find out a little bit more about what this one was like as a kid, huh?
- Oh, never mind.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Yeah. - She ever tell you about the whip-its?<eos> - Oh!<eos> Dad, come on. Her mother has to pick her up from school, because she has been busted doing whip-its in the parking lot at 11:00 a.m.<eos> Mickey, you little scamp.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> It was hard to punish her, because we've all done whip-its, right?<eos> All the time.<eos> She ever tell you about the time she got out of the car in the middle of the night?

Homeless people, drunks. God knows what kind of dangerous people wandering around.<eos> I'm yelling at her, "Hey, get back in here!" Of course, she doesn't listen.<eos> So I spent the rest of the night looking for her, thinking she'd been kidnapped or God knows what.<eos> And then I find her... at a Burger King, eating french fries and having a ball.<eos> Wow, that's a crazy story.<eos> This one's always been a little troublemaker.<eos> We tell her to do something, she does the opposite.<eos> But that's what we love about her.<eos> Lord knows she's had to put up with my shit too, so...<eos> Beautiful Pema, what have you got for us?
- Okay.<eos> - This place reeks.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Carol.<eos> - Carol, huh?<eos> Beautiful Carol.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Ah... - Marty Dobbs.<eos> How are you?<eos> - Marty Dobbs, how are you?
Love you, Mick.<eos> Hey, come on, it's bad luck not to cheers.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey!<eos> All right.<eos> I don't really feel like a beer, so I'm gonna go smoke.<eos> I could never figure out that kid's moods.<eos> God bless you, if you can.<eos> Uh, I just try to listen.<eos> You should ask her how she's doing.
I don't get it.<eos> I mean, I come here, and she gets all quiet.<eos> Won't even have a beer with her dad.<eos> Hmm, well, I wouldn't take it too personally.<eos> I think she's, um...<eos> She wants to, but...<eos> What?<eos> Well... she's sober.<eos> Sober?<eos> Yeah, like, um, you know, in the... in the program.
I need help.<eos> AA is helping me.<eos> Hmm. Yeah.<eos> All right, let me guess. You go to the meetings and you complain about your dad?<eos> Is that it, huh?<eos> It's all my fault?<eos> Jesus, Mickey.<eos> I raised you to use your brain.<eos> Not join a cult!<eos> Hey, Marty, I just want to say... you have an amazing daughter.

Mickey, come on!<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Mickey, wait!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on, just wait.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Just...<eos> Do you really fucking need people to like you that badly?<eos> I'm the one who should matter to you. Not him.<eos> "Oh, Marty, you're so funny."
- Yeah. - Thank you. - We'll do it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can smoke weed. That's not the problem.<eos> It's just that I get paranoid and I don't wanna touch the guy.<eos> Sex and bong hits, do these two activities go together?<eos> Tweet at me.<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?<eos> Um... Tommy told me to come here.<eos> No. - Do you know where Tommy is?

Ooh, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Let me try.<eos> You knew he was gonna do that.<eos> You knew he was gonna do that.<eos> Could be warmer.<eos> We should've ordered ranch dressing.<eos> Dad, can he sit with us?<eos> Well, what do you think?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Um, would you like to eat with us?

This is... this is so cool.
'Cause I just, I...<eos> I think... I'm, like, lonely out here, and I just... I'm feeling homesick.<eos> I've never seen such a sad grown-up.<eos> - Can we get the check?<eos> - Oh, this is embarrassing.<eos> Oh, that's okay.<eos> Man, I don't mean to dump everything out on you guys or...<eos> - That's fine.<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> I'll give you my address. You guys can come over and dump your feelings on me sometime.
I'm fine.<eos> Thanks for checking in, Dr. Gus.<eos> - I'm just... concerned.<eos> - Don't be concerned, dude!<eos> I'm not concerned about you.<eos> This is the shit that makes me pull away.<eos> I shouldn't have called you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Hi, do you have a few seconds to help save our oceans?
- Don't be concerned, dude!<eos> I'm not concerned about you.<eos> This is the shit that makes me pull away.<eos> I shouldn't have called you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Hi, do you have a few seconds to help save our oceans?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I have ice cream sandwiches.<eos> They melt, and then they're just not as good when you re-freeze them.<eos> You know what?
My name is Oliver Queen.<eos> After 5 years in Hell, I returned home with only one goal... To save my city.<eos> Today, I fight that war on two fronts.<eos> By day, I lead Star City as its mayor, but by night, I am someone else.<eos> I am... Something else.<eos> I am the Green Arrow.<eos> Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> Really sorry about this, Sergeant.<eos> You're not here to secure the trigger.

That's a funny way of saying we haven't slept together.<eos> Ahem.<eos> Hi. Hi, Quentin.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you today.<eos> Well, you know, that's the thing about rehab.<eos> It's a long process, and then it ain't, and by the looks of that assistant out there, you need me back bad.<eos> How about I give you guys a moment?<eos> It's all right, Ms. Williams.<eos> I wasn't planning on keeping my problems a secret.<eos> In fact, I wanted to talk with you about them, you know, on camera.

Thank you.<eos> I believe you are running late for a press conference, Mr. Mayor.
Mr. Chase's efforts further exemplify. Star City takes care of their own.<eos> Thank you, everybody.<eos> That will be all.<eos> Thank you for getting me out.<eos> Thank whoever leaked the NSA's case against Walker.<eos> My job was easy.<eos> Congratulations, Mr. Diggle.<eos> I was wondering if the D.A. might have a second to chat.<eos> Save your energy, Ms. Williams.<eos> I know you're doing a story on the death of Detective Malone.

This is personal for me, as well.<eos> I promised I'd never let another Havenrock happen again as long as it was in my power, and I believe that this qualifies.<eos> Walker will have his whole unit with him, maybe even some Markovians.<eos> We need the whole team for this.<eos> Agreed, but Quentin just got out of rehab, and with Thea out of town, I... I need someone to keep an eye on him.<eos> Who'd you have in mind?<eos> Better be the report on the Washington district water projects...<eos> Not exactly, Hoss.<eos> What are you... what?<eos> Why aren't you in your office?

I wonder how she could have made that mistake!<eos> Why don't you just do us both a favor, all right?<eos> Just go home, polish your hockey mask or something, and I'll just tell Oliver you were here the whole time.<eos> That's cool, right? I'm...<eos> Sure, except you're fresh out of rehab, not a politician, about to face the media, so what's it hurt to have a little help?
Tough guys don't say sorry, Curtis.<eos> Right.<eos> No "prosti." Err.<eos> Guys, focus.<eos> Why isn't Dinah here with us?<eos> I'm secure enough in my manhood to admit that she is way more intimidating than either one of us.<eos> Yes, and a total unknown quantity.<eos> Look tough.<eos> Maxim Ostrovsky.<eos> You speak English.

We lost Walker.<eos> - Overwatch, do you have eyes on?<eos> - Negative.<eos> All right. Meet us out back.<eos> We got to find Walker.<eos> We have his man.<eos> He'll take us right to him.<eos> Come on.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> There's no way you're Argus or DOD.

Aah! Oliver, you just gonna leave him in there?<eos> - Just give it time.<eos> - Oliver, we don't have time!<eos> We have to get Walker now, right now!<eos> Let me in there, and I'll give him all the persuasion he needs.<eos> He's gonna crack.<eos> If you push him too hard right now, he'll tell you whatever you want to hear to get the pain to stop!<eos> We have to be smart, John.<eos> You know that.<eos> As I enjoy my visits to mother Russia, have you ever considered relocating to Starling City?

So. You just got out of rehab.

All right. So. You just got out of rehab.<eos> What makes you think you're still fit to serve as deputy mayor?<eos> Well, that's a very excellent question, Susan.<eos> - Ms. Williams.<eos> - Ms. Williams.<eos> Well, I think it's my dedication to this city.<eos> I have lived here my... my whole life.<eos> So have lots of people, and I'm pretty sure not all of them are recovering alcoholics.<eos> I think it's been my ability to persevere.<eos> What are you persevering through?

You think Susan Williams is gonna go any easier?

What happened?<eos> John got a little carried away.<eos> Did he say anything?<eos> You get yourself cleaned up.<eos> - I'll be back.<eos> - Where you going?<eos> I'm going to handle this.<eos> What do you need me to do?<eos> That did not take long.<eos> Anatoly, what do you want?
They're waiting for you at home.<eos> I know.<eos> Leaving the Bratva is not going to be easy.<eos> I swore an oath of allegiance.<eos> Your father asked you to take a different vow, did he not?<eos> You told me he wanted you to right his wrongs.<eos> You cannot do that from here.<eos> Can I come in, or is it still no dogs allowed? Pfft.<eos> You really got a wiseass mouth on you, don't you?<eos> I'm not sure, but did you just say my mouth looks like ass?

I just came here to tell you that Susan Williams' producer called to confirm that 10 a.m. tomorrow still works for the interview.<eos> When did you become my assistant?<eos> When I answered the phone, I guess.<eos> It was out of line bringing up my daughter.<eos> You gonna tell that to Susan Williams at 10 a.m. tomorrow?

My daughter Laurel is gone, and I got to figure out a way to live with that which doesn't involve booze or snapping at guys that are just trying to help.<eos> You know, 10 a.m. will be here before you know it.
Well, then Prometheus wins because he'll be right.<eos> I need the two of you to prove to him and, quite frankly, to prove to me that he's not.<eos> I need the two of you to be better than me because you are.<eos> That's why we work together.<eos> There is a whole mess of angry Russian dudes outside.<eos> I have location for Walker and men to help in fight, but we have to leave now.<eos> Your strange friend's pronunciation is horrible.<eos> Yeah. I'll tutor him later.<eos> Hey. Pleasure doing business with you, Lev.<eos> You sure you don't want to toast the transaction?
Hey. Pleasure doing business with you, Lev.<eos> You sure you don't want to toast the transaction?<eos> I'd love to, but I got a plane to catch, and there's someone I'm trying to avoid.<eos> American government?<eos> Heh heh. I wish it were just that.<eos> Green Arrow, Tango headed your way.<eos> I love saying the word "Tango." So do I.<eos> In the future, you might not want to do that with a van carrying a nuclear bomb.<eos> That was neat trick. Now what's your plan?<eos> Stay down, you son of a bitch!

He was probably worried I'd do something stupid.<eos> Those were exact words actually.<eos> Ok. You need to get out of here.<eos> And he said those would be your exact words.<eos> - The bomb is in countdown mode.<eos> - What? ! It's wired with a failsafe.<eos> We must have triggered it when we entered the hangar.<eos> - Can you disarm it? - If I can't... The yield of this thing will spread over 50 miles.<eos> Do it.<eos> You know you want to.

Maybe someday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can wait for someday.<eos> Hey. What'd that bag ever do to you?<eos> - You got a minute?<eos> - Sure. How'd the interview go with, Oliver's girlfriend?<eos> Cakewalk.<eos> I didn't say much.<eos> I just told her a story about you and me.<eos> You and me? I figured you didn't remember.

I have a bond with them, Felicity.<eos> I can feel it, and let's be honest.<eos> Without the rags, I'm a liability and one the team can't risk, not with Prometheus out there.<eos> Ok. Well, that doesn't mean you have to leave.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> You'll... I mean, I'll probably just wimp out and text.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Well?<eos> - You were right.
- Quentin!<eos> - Hey.<eos> Oh, so good to see you.<eos> And you, too.<eos> I saw your interview with the dragon lady, and you nailed it.<eos> Uh, that's his girlfriend you're talking about there.<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, don't remind me.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You, uh, prosecuting him for something?
Uh, that's his girlfriend you're talking about there.<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, don't remind me.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You, uh, prosecuting him for something?<eos> Uh, actually, Quentin was just introducing us.<eos> I'm the new deputy mayor's assistant.<eos> I, uh... never should have left.<eos> Well, uh, talking of leaving, I got to get across town for an alderman meeting.<eos> Uh, you need me to come with?

Shooter is MIA.<eos> Alert the SCPD and the ACU.<eos> Drop a 5-block net around city hall.<eos> Let's get ambulances here immediately!<eos> And has anyone seen my sister?<eos> Ollie.<eos> Hey, are you all right?<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Adrian!<eos> You're gonna be ok.
That looks like a utility jumpsuit.<eos> Forefather Repair.<eos> It went belly up 6 years ago. I ran through the employee list, but I think our shooter just bought a uniform off the Internet.<eos> So he could walk into city hall.<eos> This guy's real good at covering his tracks, whoever he is.<eos> So who is he?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> That--there.<eos> Yeah, that's the guy.<eos> Run him through the system for me, would you?

I need phone numbers for the next of kin.<eos> I already emailed them to you.<eos> Look, you are gonna find whoever did this.<eos> No.<eos> I have to before he does it again.<eos> What makes you so sure this isn't just a one-time thing?<eos> If it were a one-time thing, he wouldn't have concealed his identity and he wouldn't have fled the scene.<eos> He's...<eos> Uh, Adrian?<eos> Oh, what are you doing?

He's...<eos> Uh, Adrian?<eos> Oh, what are you doing?<eos> Can you talk some sense into him, please?<eos> Mr. Mayor, Thea, meet my wife--Doris.<eos> Hi.<eos> He's gonna get himself killed.<eos> And--<eos> I'm tougher than I look, and I need to be in the office.<eos> You need to be in bed, Adrian.

And it-- it doesn't appear that I was his primary target because he just...<eos> Blasted his way through city hall.<eos> If he wasn't going after you, then there's a larger agenda here.<eos> AR-15s are the Bertinelli family's weapon of choice.<eos> Over 90% of the hits they were involved in last year used them.<eos> Why would the Bertinellis target city hall?<eos> Because your office oversees the Anti-Crime unit.<eos> And it is a softer target.<eos> All right.<eos> We're gonna look into it under one condition-- you listen to your wife and you stay here.
Guys, can we please, just not right now?<eos> I don't have no problem with your right to bear arms so long as it doesn't conflict with my right to, you know, live.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Look at what we do, man.<eos> Our whole life is violence.<eos> I'm not talking about what we do to protect the city.<eos> I'm talking about the fact that as a black man I am 3 times more likely to be killed by a gun than you.<eos> He's got a point, Rene.<eos> Seriously?<eos> You were a cop, man.
Thanks, Daddy.<eos> Of course.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Everything's fine, sweetheart.<eos> Um, go get your PJ's on and get ready for bed.<eos> I'm gonna go check on mommy, all right?<eos> At this time, our thoughts and our prayers are with the injured and the loved ones of the fallen.<eos> This office is working tirelessly with the SCPD and the Anti-Crime unit to make sure that Mr. Edlund, the perpetrator of this heinous act of violence, is apprehended and swiftly brought to justice.<eos> I will be taking questions now.<eos> Do you have any comments on rumors that this shooting was in retaliation for the preceding administration's failure to pass the gun control ordinance?
Do you have any comments on rumors that this shooting was in retaliation for the preceding administration's failure to pass the gun control ordinance?<eos> Mr. Edlund is clearly a disturbed individual, but I can't comment on his motivations at this time.<eos> What is your administration's position on the Star City gun registry?<eos> That we will be looking into it further.<eos> What's your administration's position on gun control?<eos> We're gonna examine all sides of that.<eos> What is your personal opinion?<eos> That it's complicated.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but 7 of your staffers are dead and others severely injured.<eos> Don't you think you owe them a response beyond "it's complicated"?
I want to meet with them today.<eos> We're not gonna solve this right away.<eos> Are you sure that you want to open that can of worms? I--<eos> I--I just mean that gun control is a big political third rail.<eos> Thea, come on. Thea, I understand.<eos> This shouldn't be about politics.<eos> This should be about safety and security-- everyone's safety and security whether they own a gun or not.<eos> Now, let's get to work.<eos> All right.<eos> Councilwoman, thank you very much for meeting with me.

No.

Why is the second amendment somehow less important in your eyes than the other 9 in the bill of rights?<eos> Because people are dying, councilwoman, right here in this building.<eos> And there are limitations on abortion and freedom of speech.<eos> Both my parents are dead.<eos> My friend Tommy was a...<eos> He was one of the 503 killed in the Undertaking.<eos> Laurel Lance was my friend.<eos> Nobody respects the rights of someone to protect themselves and the people that they care for more than me, but everything in life comes with limitations.<eos> Everything.<eos> Why are you telling me this?

And I sprung for the good doughnuts this week.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, man, my name's Rene Ramirez.<eos> I work for the deputy mayor.<eos> This is my assistant.<eos> In his dreams!<eos> Or, uh, I mean, yeah, kind of.<eos> Can we ask you some questions about James Edlund?<eos> Participation in this group is confidential.<eos> You know what Edlund did?

He planned out his attacks.<eos> Yeah. But this, this doesn't match city hall.<eos> This is...<eos> Oh, damn!<eos> I know what he's gonna hit next.<eos> I am still failing to understand why a simple registry--<eos> Ok, first of all, registries are never simple.<eos> They're bureaucracies.<eos> Tying up second amendment rights in red tape.<eos> You know, and-- and it's not just the owners who'll be affected.
I thought we were staying till we're done.<eos> I'm terribly sorry, but I have to go.<eos> We're in position, northeast corner.<eos> I'm on the southwest.<eos> Overwatch.<eos> No sign of the bastard, but, remember, he's good at avoiding security cameras.<eos> Hey, don't--don't!<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Get back.<eos> You had another chance to shoot me at city hall.

Mr. Edlund... I--I checked.<eos> The man who killed your family, he acquired those guns illegally.<eos> There's nothing that we could have done.<eos> No--no--no registry would have helped us protect them.<eos> I know.<eos> I was supposed to protect them.<eos> Isn't that a man's job to protect his family?<eos> Isn't that why we have guns?<eos> My wife and daughters were innocent!<eos> I--I can understand why you're angry.
My wife and daughters were innocent!<eos> I--I can understand why you're angry.<eos> We're all angry!<eos> We're all so angry all the time.<eos> So why shouldn't I use this?<eos> Why shouldn't I kill everyone, put us all out of our damn misery.<eos> Mr. Edlund, that's not your call to make.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm--I mean, people are angry, and--and we're hurting, and we're lashing out. And I can understand that it feels like it's--it's getting worse every day.<eos> But what you're doing is not the answer.

I know that you want this pain to go away.

Please?<eos> When you ran out on me last night, you neglected to mention that it was to go help people at a hospital.
Citywide gun control ordinances.<eos> Nothing that makes it harder to buy or own or carry a gun.<eos> It also doesn't prohibit people from protecting themselves.<eos> From gun violence.<eos> Ok.<eos> I'm gonna back you on this if for no other reason than the optics of fighting this after what happened are lousy.<eos> There are other reasons, too, councilwoman.<eos> But I want to be perfectly clear about something.<eos> Not today, not tomorrow, but eventually, I am going to extract a political price for this.<eos> You can count on that.
Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> What happened?<eos> Gregor... his loyalty lies with Kovar, but Gregor is Pakhan.<eos> There is nothing we can do.<eos> We can kill him.<eos> These corrupt cops are taking down big drug scores.<eos> You said you're not a criminal, that you believe in justice.
Now we're sure this is the address?<eos> Yeah, Felicity is.<eos> According to her, this is the house that Justin Claybourne bought for his mistress.<eos> Think she'll play ball?<eos> - T hat depends?<eos> - On what?<eos> Whether or not she knows her son is Prometheus.<eos> - Amanda Westfield?<eos> My name is Oliver...<eos> I know who you are, mayor of Star City.
Whether or not she knows her son is Prometheus.<eos> - Amanda Westfield?<eos> My name is Oliver...<eos> I know who you are, mayor of Star City.<eos> May I come in?<eos> Very lovely home.<eos> For the past several months... there has been a serial murderer that has been terrorizing Star City.<eos> There is reason to believe that this individual is your son.<eos> I haven't seen my son since Justin Claybourne's funeral.<eos> But you know he's become something else, someone else.

Get back to your seat!<eos> Can't a girl stretch her legs a little? Sorry.<eos> I didn't catch your name.<eos> And you're not going to!
What's going on?<eos> We just have a couple questions for you, captain.<eos> We heard the ACU attempted to apprehend the Green Arrow last night.<eos> - Is that true?<eos> - 100%.<eos> He's a person of interest in the murder of Detective Malone.<eos> Based on what evidence?<eos> This was delivered to me yesterday.<eos> Open it.<eos> You'll see what I saw.
Well, Quentin, that advice would mean a little bit more if it wasn't coming from Thea right now.<eos> Well, I don't know what that means, but I do know that if you're letting Prometheus, ACU, or anyone else keep you from stopping Warner and her buddies, then justice isn't being served.<eos> I will have Felicity look at Russo's phone.<eos> That's what I wanted to hear.<eos> I'll take another run at Pike.<eos> No, I'll do it.<eos> You sure?<eos> I'm sure that I don't want Malone's death to have been for nothing.<eos> Mr. Mayor.<eos> Do you have a minute for me?
I'm sure that I don't want Malone's death to have been for nothing.<eos> Mr. Mayor.<eos> Do you have a minute for me?<eos> Of course.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> It's, it's about the Green Arrow.<eos> Sir, we've been over this.<eos> And I know that I told you that the Green Arrow was not responsible for Billy.<eos> That's not entirely true.<eos> You got my attention.
Of course.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> It's, it's about the Green Arrow.<eos> Sir, we've been over this.<eos> And I know that I told you that the Green Arrow was not responsible for Billy.<eos> That's not entirely true.<eos> You got my attention.<eos> Prometheus manipulated the Green Arrow into killing Detective Malone by making it appear that Malone was Prometheus.<eos> Rightly fearing a citywide panic, District Attorney Chase covered up the circumstances of Malone's death.<eos> And how do you know this?

How very selfless of you.<eos> I did not expect it.<eos> But don't worry. My word is good.<eos> Anatoly will not be harmed.<eos> Aah! Anatoly, look at you.<eos> Hiding like a rat in the sewer.<eos> Did not expect this from Bratva captain.<eos> But then you're not going to be Bratva captain for much longer.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> Adrian, just once, I'm gonna need you to walk into my office and not say that.

Apparently, I've been plagiarizing my stories for the past years, and my laptop is filled with incriminating evidence, but now I've been thoroughly discredited.<eos> Did you hack Susan Williams' computer?<eos> Thea asked me to put a few things on Susan's computer.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Thea asked you?<eos> The mayor's office ordered the falsification of autopsy reports to protect the identity of Detective Malone's killer.<eos> If any of these allegations prove true, it would likely trigger impeachment proceedings.<eos> This might be the end of my administration.<eos> When did you learn the Green Arrow killed Detective Malone?

- Hi, Susan.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Busy reporting for my new blog.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've been try... My first entry will be how you never took this job seriously.<eos> As mayor, you just phoned it in.<eos> You'll only ever be that other guy, but, of course, I can't write that because no one will believe me now that you trashed my credibility.<eos> I had nothing to do with that, but I am working to make it right.<eos> Whatever. You deserve today.<eos> So what do you think Oliver's chances are?
And you're still in bed with these people?<eos> What? You make it sound like it's a bad thing.<eos> I mean, Pandora's just a tool.<eos> Sounds to me like this could be a weapon.<eos> Ok, and is there a problem if it is?<eos> - It depends, Felicity.<eos> - On what?<eos> On how you use it.<eos> My autopsy showed that mortal injury on the deceased was consistent with the edging of the arrow heads used by the Green Arrow.<eos> I have here your original cause-of-death report, in which you conclude that the Green Arrow killed Malone, but this report, it was never included in the case file.

He didn't have to.<eos> He said the request came from the mayor himself.<eos> - The mayor?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He told me the Green Arrow killed Detective Malone.<eos> Did mayor Queen say why?<eos> He said the Throwing Star Killer, a man we'd been calling Prometheus, manipulated him.<eos> Did he say why this Prometheus would want to orchestrate Detective Malone's murder?<eos> No.<eos> Standing here today, do you believe what Mr. Queen has told you?
Get to safety.<eos> Quentin, the driver.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> You want me?<eos> Lucky you.<eos> You get one more day.<eos> Ahem. Ok. All right.<eos> Look.<eos> I appreciate what you're doing, but I'm fine.
- Easy, all right?<eos> He knows the concussion protocol, right?<eos> Yeah, so I've heard.<eos> - This was vigilante.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Apparently because of the impeachment hearing, I'm a criminal.<eos> You ok?<eos> Never felt better.<eos> Hey, so I made sure the Unis keep all the press behind the cordon.<eos> Trust me, you don't want them snapping shots of you in an ambulance.

What about councilman Kullens?<eos> Last time I checked, he's part of everybody.<eos> Why?<eos> You know why. You want to blackmail him?<eos> It's not blackmail.<eos> It's politics.<eos> Come here. In the wake of the attack, councilman Kullens has called a brief recess to the impeachment hearings.<eos> If the mayor is medically cleared, the council will vote tomorrow.<eos> Ok.<eos> Sounds like you need a note from your doctor, Mr. Mayor.

Your CAT scan is clear.
I can only imagine, given your other job, and... you're right... Your CAT scan is clear.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Not so fast.<eos> Look. I can't discharge you without a few more hours of observation.<eos> Dr. Schwartz...<eos> People can withstand only so much strain, and being both mayor and him, it's unsustainable.<eos> I assure you, my body can handle it.<eos> I'm not talking about your body, Mr. Queen.<eos> I'm talking about this.<eos> The mind needs rest or at least someone to take your thoughts off all the evil you face each day.

Well, maybe I'm fresh out.<eos> Because of Billy.<eos> It's a dark world, and for the past 4 years, I have watched you and Oliver and Laurel and Thea and Roy.<eos> I have watched all of you use a little darkness to fight it.<eos> That's true.<eos> Sometimes we do fight fire with fire, but every time we do, Felicity, every single time, we risk being burned.<eos> Some days, I can't help but feel as if the city wants to collapse in on itself and all we're doing is delaying the inevitable.<eos> No. We're preventing it.<eos> We're the good guys.<eos> Don't you forget that, Pike.
If vigilante gets to him, we'll be doing this without Oliver permanently.<eos> - Let's suit up.<eos> - Suit up. Sorry.<eos> I thought, um... I thought since Oliver's gone,<eos> I would probably... but it makes more sense probably for you...<eos> I'll make sure I work on the timing of that, promise.<eos> - Balls.<eos> - My T-sphere...<eos> Don't call them balls.<eos> You speak with Pollard?
- My T-sphere...<eos> Don't call them balls.<eos> You speak with Pollard?<eos> She won't call you to testify without Kullens' blessing...<eos> We're not gonna get that.<eos> And the council hearing directly from you is only one of two ways I can see us winning this thing.<eos> - What's the second way? - You won't like it.<eos> Does it involve offering up a sacrificial lamb?<eos> Either me or Detective Malone.<eos> Oliver, this impeachment is about punishing someone, and if you don't offer up a name, this will be the last time you're looking out that window.

Once you did, you made them make it right, right?<eos> - Are we off the record?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So what happens next?<eos> You mean, what do I do with your secret?<eos> I keep it.<eos> I care about the city, and... And you're working double time to make it a better place.<eos> I do appreciate that, but I meant what happens next with us?<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but I think you'll be happy that we did.

I liked many of you.<eos> Prometheus surprised me with a very specific, unique move.<eos> It was taught to me by a woman that I met in Russia.<eos> You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher?<eos> You're accepting the invitation to join Helix.<eos> Full throttle.<eos> What do I do with your secret?<eos> I keep it.<eos> I care about the city, and... and you're working double-time.<eos> Can you talk some sense into him, please?
Power to the people, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Power to the people.<eos> Welcome to Helix, Felicity.<eos> We're gonna change the world together.<eos> Mr. Queen, I've been - trying to reach you...<eos> - I need Captain Pike and Quentin Lance in my office, and I need to know where D.A. Chase is right now.<eos> Right now, Mr. Chase is in the conference room.<eos> Treatment for drug addicts over incarceration.<eos> Mr. Mayor, I didn't think you'd be joining us this morning.

Every horror movie ever has basically said that you do not go upstairs at a creepy serial killer's mother's house.<eos> Help!<eos> Excellent.<eos> Now give us another scream.<eos> So, what, we're supposed to just go to work like things are normal?<eos> Because newsflash... they ain't.<eos> Tell me something I don't already know. Ho ho!<eos> I did think of one or two things.<eos> This is nice, everything being out in the open now, all the cards on the table, as it were.<eos> You got some nerve showing up here.

He's at city hall.<eos> You got a green light to move on his house.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Ok, Spartan.<eos> You check the upstairs and work your way down.<eos> I'll sweep the basement. We can meet in the middle.<eos> Roger that.<eos> - Please don't hurt me.<eos> - Mrs. Chase.<eos> What are you doing in my hou...
- Please don't hurt me.<eos> - Mrs. Chase.<eos> What are you doing in my hou...<eos> Mrs. Chase, I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> Your husband isn't who you think he is.<eos> Get out of my house.<eos> Mrs. Chase, your husband is the Throwing Star Killer.<eos> He's holding an innocent woman hostage, and I need your help to find her.<eos> - You're insane.

He has 24 hours before I am ordering the SCPD to shoot on sight.<eos> That's all.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks for seeing me. I know it's late.<eos> Uh, I think we both know our jobs don't recognize late and early.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> What's this?<eos> That is evidence that Adrian Chase is a false identity.<eos> His real name is Simon Morrison.<eos> In the midst of an investigation, you will learn that he is the Throwing Star Killer.
In the midst of an investigation, you will learn that he is the Throwing Star Killer.<eos> That's one hell of an accusation.<eos> That's why I'm giving you that.<eos> And this evidence comes from where?<eos> An investigation that I've been conducting off the books.<eos> With what personnel?<eos> Work the lead, Captain Pike.<eos> Consider that an order if it helps.<eos> One last thing.<eos> You didn't get that from me.
You're right.<eos> Felicity, please tell me you're not going to see them again.<eos> Dinah's right.<eos> They're the ones that found Susan.<eos> Gregor!<eos> Oliver, is that you?<eos> No.<eos> It's the man who's gonna kill you.<eos> Agh!<eos> You up for making a statement?
Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> I have a village, too, run by a government strongman named Kovar.<eos> You will go to Russia and find my parents and tell them what happened to me and Vlad.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> _ _<eos> Tell me who this Prometheus is.<eos> I guess you know what I've been up to, huh?
He will suspect something is up.<eos> I could try to talk to Galina.<eos> - To who?<eos> - I told you about Taiana.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Galina's her mother.<eos> And she works for Kovar.<eos> Maybe she heard something.<eos> Your boss?<eos> You... you work for Konstantin Kovar.

No, no.<eos> I'm friends with Taiana.<eos> My precious Taiana?<eos> W--well, we're friends. And I--I...<eos> - I could use your help with something.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm no- - I'm not gonna shoot.<eos> I'm not gonna shoot.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> When Kovar hears about this, you cannot say you saw me, do you understand?

Were his, uh, other last words about who killed him?<eos> He called the man kapiushon.<eos> "Hood."<eos> Da. Reports of man with a bow and arrow are disrupting business, Bratva and otherwise.<eos> That's interesting.<eos> I heard some reports of my own of--of you having trouble with Gregor because of his deal with me.

I know someone.<eos> Well, if you're thinking about house lady, last time it did not go so well.<eos> Give me a second chance.<eos> And if second chance doesn't work?<eos> Miss Venediktov...<eos> Eh, he's--he's fine.<eos> Well, he's unconscious, but he--look, I'm sorry that I scared you the other night.<eos> I just--I--I need to speak with you.<eos> I-- well, it's like I said, I knew your-- your children, Taiana and Vlad.<eos> Do you know what happened to them?
I just--I--I need to speak with you.<eos> I-- well, it's like I said, I knew your-- your children, Taiana and Vlad.<eos> Do you know what happened to them?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They're-- they're dead.<eos> But Mr. Kovar say he's still looking for them.<eos> Kovar is lying.<eos> Before she died, Taiana, well, she told me that he was a monster.<eos> And she made me promise-- she made me swear that I would bring him to justice. Ohh.<eos> But even what you say is true, what could I do?

It's over.<eos> Well, how do you figure that?<eos> Chase doesn't give up easy.<eos> He doesn't need to do anything.<eos> He's already won.<eos> Mr. Mayor, your 11:00 is here.<eos> Thank you for your compassion in granting me bereavement leave,<eos> Mr. Mayor...<eos> Doris' death has been very difficult.<eos> Yeah? Well, maybe you shouldn't have killed her, then.
Let's suit up.<eos> Suit up.<eos> Wait.<eos> We don't have suits. You meant figuratively suit up.<eos> Suit up, like, "we're still in the lair.<eos> Suit up," like, but we're not in the lai...<eos> But do you see what I'm saying?<eos> Quite an escort.<eos> Green Arrow could be anywhere.<eos> Who do you think is under that hood?
It was vintage.<eos> Looks like we found our guy.<eos> ♪ Arrow 5x19 ♪ Dangerous Liaisons Original Air Date on April 26, 2017<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Chase escaped the arcade by using a secret tunnel that led to Port Newark.<eos> Homeland Security's placed him on a no-fly list.<eos> No.<eos> He's not gonna leave the country.<eos> He isn't done yet.<eos> How do you know?
How do you know?<eos> - Call it a hunch.<eos> - A hunch?<eos> Mayor Queen, this city deserves better than a hunch.<eos> Excuse the interruption.<eos> I can't hold them off any longer.<eos> Ahem. All right.<eos> I can take a few questions.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - You worked side by side with Adrian Chase for months.

- Ok.<eos> So?<eos> - So the information was then sent to an unsecured phone.<eos> Seems like a big-time breach in operational security.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - Wait what?<eos> What if Chase has a buddy inside Argus, someone who tipped him off, who pinged the unsecured cell phone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Mr. Mayor. - Hi.<eos> Could you give us some space?
Looks like the elevator was hacked in real time. Pulling up the rootkit now.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> "Oh--oh--oh, my God" what?<eos> There's just a line of code here I'm not quite getting, but I think I know someone at Helix who can help.<eos> Don't you need to show them the code?<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Very helpful, Curtis.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Grover, but the specifics of the investigation into Adrian Chase, they're just not open to the public.<eos> The mother of my children is dead, and you can't tell me anything.
Chase has been in the wind for a week.<eos> He was trained by Talia al Ghul. He knows how to stay in the wind.<eos> What other leads do we have?<eos> How else are we gonna bring Adrian Chase to justice unless Argus lets go of Cayden James. - Well, then my only choice is to help Helix.<eos> Your only choice?<eos> Felicity, I thought we were on the same side.<eos> No, John. I'm on the side that's gonna put Chase away so that he can't hurt anyone ever again. Hey, Felicity.<eos> Let her go, man.<eos> Now's not the time.<eos> You wanted to see me, Hoss? Yeah.
No, John. I'm on the side that's gonna put Chase away so that he can't hurt anyone ever again. Hey, Felicity.<eos> Let her go, man.<eos> Now's not the time.<eos> You wanted to see me, Hoss? Yeah.<eos> F-first, close the door.<eos> Second, what have I told you about calling me "Hoss"?<eos> - Don't.<eos> - Right.<eos> Oh, just sit down.<eos> Are you firing me?
- Right.<eos> Oh, just sit down.<eos> Are you firing me?<eos> Oh, Rene, there was a time when I would have loved to hear you ask me that, but, no, I am not firing you.<eos> I want to talk to you about...<eos> Yeah, your daughter.<eos> Yeah. I know her name, Hoss.<eos> I thought I told you I don't want to talk about her.<eos> Well, that's too bad because you happen to be working for a guy who would give anything to be with his daughter again.<eos> What do you want from me, man?
Please.<eos> Just leave this alone, man.<eos> I think we both know I'm not gonna, so why don't we just skip to the part where you tell me why you do not want to see your daughter?<eos> Ok.<eos> When Curtis told me about his lawyer friend, I got excited, ok?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> All right, and then what happened?<eos> I remembered why they took Zoe away from me in the first place.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I--I could visit her with a court-appointed guardian like you said.
I don't want that to happen to my wife.<eos> I've done a lot of illegal things, but none of them have required heavy weaponry or any weaponry.<eos> You know, I found the transition between hacker to vigilante to be surprisingly straightforward.<eos> You're gonna do great.<eos> Besides, you have enough firepower here to invade Russia.<eos> Well, hopefully, we won't have to.<eos> Think we might.<eos> They know we're coming.<eos> I'm not worried.<eos> In case you need them.
I mean-- in the meantime, I think we go home.<eos> Why?<eos> There's more glasses in the bunk--<eos> Oh, you want to drink by your-- ok.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> That make--yeah.<eos> Thank you both very much for tonight.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're working late.

Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> That make--yeah.<eos> Thank you both very much for tonight.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're working late.<eos> Well, I thought I'd stick around for my thank-you.<eos> You had that coming for sure along with an apology.<eos> There I was thinking you didn't know what an apology was.<eos> I guess you can teach a dog some new tricks, even wild ones.
I will contact you when I'm on site.<eos> Call me back, will you?<eos> Better yet, just show up.<eos> Things are going to all kinds of hell around here.<eos> Still no luck?<eos> No.<eos> It's like Oliver's dropped off the face of the earth again.<eos> How's it going over here?<eos> Well, every defense attorney in town just found out that the D.A. is a serial killer, so not good.<eos> You think the court's gonna overturn Chase's convictions?
I get it now.<eos> I understand...<eos> Why you lied to me about William, why you had to.<eos> I get it, and for the extent that I judged you-- and I did judge you-- I'm sorry.<eos> You know, you said you didn't know what kind of person you are.<eos> I think you should figure that out.<eos> William.<eos> My name is Matthew.<eos> But it used to be William, right, before you and your mom left Central City?<eos> You know my mom?
We're nowhere.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the building.<eos> What?<eos> Why? A suspicious package was received by your office.<eos> - When?<eos> - Just now. A large crate that set off the dogs.<eos> Bomb squad's on the way.<eos> Well, any indication where it was delivered from?<eos> No return address, but the sender's a Simon Morrison.<eos> Sir, I can't allow you to... then resign.
If that was true, he would not have tried to kill us.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Well, this just washed up on the shore like some kind of sign.<eos> Yeah, that you're crazy.<eos> Come on.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> I'm taking you somewhere to explain why I'm doing what I'm doing.<eos> I spent a year on this island.<eos> You never told me there was a bar.<eos> Hey, you busy?
Good news is in short supply around here.<eos> I got a court date. Ha!<eos> Finally you're getting prosecuted.<eos> That is good news.<eos> Funny.<eos> It's for Zoe.<eos> Lawyer thinks I can get expedited custody.<eos> Oh, wow. That's terrific.<eos> Huh. Good for you, Hoss!<eos> I thought maybe, you know, since you, uh, gave me the push, you...
I mean, if there is a connection between Chase's father and framing yours, I don't know what it is.<eos> We might have found someone who can help with that, Darren Coffman.<eos> The last dude councilman Goodwin saw before he disappeared.<eos> SCPD interviewed him back in '02, but we think they didn't get the whole story.<eos> Coffman was Goodwin's lawyer, but not just his lawyer.<eos> Coffman also represented Chase's old man.<eos> Mr. Coffman, thank you for coming on such short notice.<eos> This is my sister Thea.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> Your office didn't mention why you wanted to see me.
Coffman also represented Chase's old man.<eos> Mr. Coffman, thank you for coming on such short notice.<eos> This is my sister Thea.<eos> A pleasure.<eos> Your office didn't mention why you wanted to see me.<eos> It's regarding the recent reports about our father.<eos> I never had the opportunity to meet him.<eos> But your father did some remarkable things for this city.<eos> What's happening with his reputation right now is... simply terrible, but I can't understand what it could have to do with me.<eos> Reportedly, you were the last person seen with councilman Goodwin.

I would've still been on the floor.<eos> I'm very sorry. Oh.<eos> I was worried this might have gotten hurt.<eos> What is it?<eos> They are sound modulators that I've been working on for Dinah.<eos> Not only will they be able to focus her canary cry, but they will be able to override any kind of sonic dampeners.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - She's coming, right?<eos> She said if work didn't go too late, then she'd swing on by.<eos> - Thank you. - Cake.
I am not in the mood, Malcolm.<eos> Human connections are what keep us human.<eos> And it's sad that it-- that it's a sociopath who's gonna have to point this out to you.<eos> You can't live on an island.<eos> You've already tried.<eos> But you are always gonna have people in your life, Oliver, and they will always need you, for better or worse, baggage and all.<eos> And if you can't accept that, well, your past is gonna stay your anchor.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mr. Queen, the marshals are here to transfer the prisoner.<eos> You said you wanted to know.
Hey, but just so that we're clear...<eos> The moment I get on that transfer chopper, my friends have orders to kill yours.<eos> I think you're about to get a phone call.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello.<eos> Somebody help me.<eos> Please help me.<eos> Please.<eos> I need the van.<eos> Sir, what are you doing?
Yes, I am, because Chase is working with at least Black Siren,<eos> Evelyn Sharp, Talia al Ghul, and whatever army she's currently controlling.<eos> So you called in reinforcements.<eos> If I wasn't such a confident individual, my ego might be bruised.<eos> Malcolm, your ego is what I'm gonna need you to keep in check.<eos> Why?<eos> Who did you reach out to?<eos> Husband.<eos> Mr. Merlyn.<eos> I assume you still have no title.
We'll see if there's an exit further down this way.<eos> It's over.<eos> How the hell?<eos> Come on!<eos> We're gonna have to go back and find another way.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> I should have killed you when I had the chance.<eos> I won't make that mistake again?<eos> I guess I should thank you.<eos> I thought you were on his side.

There's a big hole down there, dumps right into the storm drain.<eos> What about the three bodies at the spice shop?<eos> We're gonna have to deal with them, too, while it's still dark.<eos> I'll go with Monroe and Rosalee.<eos> I'm gonna go with them too, seeing as I'm the one that killed them.<eos> Meet up with you later.<eos> So, how do we get these guys down into the tunnel?<eos> The hell do you think you're doing?<eos> I need search warrants.<eos> You woke me up for search warrants?
I need search warrants.<eos> You woke me up for search warrants?<eos> I need a lot of them.<eos> I don't care if you are the new mayor.<eos> Bonaparte's dead.<eos> What?<eos> Burkhardt killed him.<eos> The Grimm killed Bonaparte?<eos> And I'm taking him down for it.<eos> How many warrants do you need?
The Grimm killed Bonaparte?<eos> And I'm taking him down for it.<eos> How many warrants do you need?<eos> What the hell happened here?<eos> We're not sure, Captain.<eos> All we know is what the jailer told us.<eos> Seven North Precinct cops were sent to transport Burkhardt to the North Precinct, and somehow, between the time he was taken out of his cell to before he got out of the building, these two got into it with somebody... or something.<eos> There were no witnesses.<eos> The rest of us were out on a bunch of bogus 911 calls.<eos> And, you know, Captain, I think it's a little too coincidental that we got those calls just when they were coming to get Burkhardt.
Listen, has Nick contacted you?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I'm thinking he should be turning himself in... or getting the hell out of the country, because I don't want anything to do with taking down one of our own.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> Looks like he's cleaning out his office.<eos> If Renard's looking for a legitimate way to kill Nick, you can bet we're on his list.<eos> Well, Renard's on my list.<eos> We need to warn Nick.<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you with Bonaparte?
He's dead.<eos> When?<eos> Tonight.<eos> How did he die?<eos> The Grimm killed him.<eos> We were told the Grimm was dead.<eos> He should have been.<eos> Something's protecting him.<eos> I don't know what.<eos> You find out and deal with it.
Tonight.<eos> How did he die?<eos> The Grimm killed him.<eos> We were told the Grimm was dead.<eos> He should have been.<eos> Something's protecting him.<eos> I don't know what.<eos> You find out and deal with it.<eos> We have suffered a major setback in Portland.<eos> It's imperative that you take control of the city.
I want teams at both places.<eos> We're moving teams from here to here.<eos> What do you want us to do when they're in place? I don't like the look of that.<eos> How do we stop that son of a bitch?<eos> There's always a bullet.<eos> I'm sort of half joking.<eos> I'm sort of half laughing.<eos> Something's going on.<eos> That something's coming at us.<eos> I know you know where Burkhardt is.
Sometimes I wonder if I could ever live up to it.<eos> You know, maybe that's the attitude that got you hooked in the first place?<eos> I don't want to disappoint her.<eos> Izzy, it's... it's Okay to struggle.<eos> Life is a struggle.<eos> The point is that you are in recovery, and you are succeeding.<eos> Quite well, I might add.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> I am.<eos> I hear you want Valentine dead.
Quite well, I might add.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> I am.<eos> I hear you want Valentine dead.<eos> I can get you in and out of his cell undetected, tonight.<eos> Who is this?<eos> My anonymity is for your protection as well as mine.<eos> If you have access to Valentine, why not kill him yourself?<eos> I'm no match against Valentine.<eos> But as his former parabatai, you are.

What are you doing here?
Not exactly.<eos> I'm having trouble with some of my paperwork.<eos> Look, I can't help you tonight. I'm busy.<eos> Busy eating alone?<eos> I... have a date!<eos> A date?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fantastic!<eos> Good for you.<eos> Are you... taking her here?
This is what I'm talking about.<eos> The Clave has to know about this.<eos> If Valentine was able to escape, they have to execute him.<eos> The Clave already knows.<eos> It won't change their minds.<eos> What other options do we have?<eos> I need to talk to my pack.<eos> Excuse me while I make a phone call.<eos> Let's take a recess.<eos> So, have you reconsidered my offer?
You hear of any of 'em feeding on a mundane in Queens last night?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> A girl was found dead, bite marks.<eos> Whoever did it was one hungry vampire...<eos> Her body was completely drained of blood.<eos> No, I haven't heard anything. But if I do, of course I'll tell you.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> What do you got, Detective?
C'mon, you have to remember...<eos> What did you do?<eos> Care for seconds?<eos> Police!<eos> Put your hands on your head!<eos> Drop to your knees.<eos> I'm sorry... I'm sorry I bit her.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> You're under arrest for the murder of Heidi McKenzie.<eos> - You have the right to remain silent.

You can't just arrest him. That's why we need to find him before the police do.<eos> Then what?<eos> We're supposed to turn him over to the Clave.<eos> Can't we just keep this quiet?<eos> You know, like Alec did for you.<eos> If it's true, if Simon did somehow lose control and make some horrible mistake, we can't just give up on him.<eos> Look, whatever mess he's gotten himself into, I promise I'm not giving up on Simon.<eos> They say the bad guy always goes back to the scene of the crime.<eos> I always thought it was a myth, but since I'd run out of leads, I thought, hey, why not?<eos> So why'd you do it?
Odd compulsion.<eos> You know, I've seen plenty of different ways to kill people, but biting into a girl's feet?<eos> - That's a new one.<eos> - Her feet?<eos> No. That can't be right.<eos> The M.E. says the wounds below her ankle were the most recent.<eos> - I didn't do this.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Ever since I was a kid, feet have totally grossed me out.<eos> - Even women's feet. - You know what grosses me out?
So, when are you going to come visit Alicante?<eos> Soon.<eos> As long as you promise your mom won't drag us to the Accords Hall for another Clave assembly.<eos> I definitely can't promise that.<eos> I still don't get what your obsession is with this restaurant.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I want to talk to you about Simon Lewis.<eos> Luke, I... I've never seen anything like it.<eos> It was straight out of some superhero movie.<eos> - Did you mention it to anyone?

I...<eos> - I'm not proud of what I have to do, but it's for your own protection.<eos> - The Shadow World is a dangerous place.<eos> - The Shadow what?<eos> And who the hell is he?<eos> You will forget the name Simon Lewis.
Hello.<eos> How can I help you today?<eos> It's a fabulous shop you have here.<eos> Why thank you.<eos> It's been my life's work.<eos> Absolutely fascinating.<eos> I'm Sebastian Verlac.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.<eos> Elliot Nourse.<eos> Anything in particular I can help you find?
That.<eos> In there.<eos> You and Maia.<eos> There is no me and Maia.<eos> OK, Simon, you can't possibly be that clueless. OK?<eos> She likes you.<eos> It's obvious.<eos> She doesn't like me.<eos> When a girl likes you and you ask her out, most of the time she doesn't say no.<eos> She didn't tell you why?
This was the real Sebastian Verlac.<eos> Ave atque vale.<eos> Hail and farewell.<eos> Jace...<eos> It's a possessing demon.<eos> The same kind that murdered my mom.<eos> Then we know how to kill it.<eos> We'll make 'em pay for what they did to you.<eos> We're going to make them pay for everything.<eos> Have you notified the Verlac family yet?
We'll make 'em pay for what they did to you.<eos> We're going to make them pay for everything.<eos> Have you notified the Verlac family yet?<eos> The Penhallow daughter, Aline, will deliver the message in person, Madame Inquisitor.<eos> Defiling the body of a fallen soldier and turning it into a booby trap is sadly par for the course<eos> - for Valentine, isn't it? - The possessing demon wouldn't have done this its own.<eos> The trap could only have been set using the Mortal Cup to command it.<eos> So he had it all along.<eos> And our intel shows he's also in possession of the Mortal Sword.<eos> Do you have any good news for me today, - Mr. Lightwood?
You're gonna want that drink now.<eos> Where, oh where is Simon?<eos> Your Highness. What an unpleasant surprise.<eos> I'm sure she didn't mean to...<eos> No offense, Alec, but I agree with Clary.<eos> Your Majesty... is this another one of your little games?<eos> The Institute called an emergency meeting of the Downworld Council.<eos> I speak on behalf of the Downworld.<eos> Magnus, is this true?<eos> Henceforth, when you need anything from the Downworld, you shall address me, Mr. Lightwood.
You, Jonathan Morgenstern, are brilliant... and as cunning and vicious as I have ever hoped for.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I will come back for you.<eos> I promise.<eos> I will kill them all.<eos> Then let's stack the deck in your favor.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I couldn't help notice your tattoo there.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You ever thought about getting a second one?
What a surprise.<eos> We need a warlock to seal one this severe.<eos> - The demons don't discriminate between Downworlder, Shadowhunter, mundane.<eos> They kill them all.<eos> I'll seal the rift. But not because of you or the Shadowhunters.<eos> Because it'll save lives.<eos> Consul Malachi.<eos> Jace Herondale of the New York Institute.<eos> Clary Fairchild.<eos> I know who you are.
Consul Malachi.<eos> Jace Herondale of the New York Institute.<eos> Clary Fairchild.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Valentine is on his way to Lake Lyn. - He has the sword and the cup.<eos> - Yes, I'm quite aware of Valentine's progress.<eos> We need to get to the water.<eos> Now.<eos> I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.<eos> You're a Circle member!

I do not know precisely.<eos> The woods are vast. Not to mention dangerous for a...<eos> Do you have any idea how many speeches I've heard Malachi give?<eos> How many times I've heard him... preach loyalty to Clave above all else under the Angel?<eos> And all along he's... he's been working with our greatest enemy.<eos> How does the Consul, the leader of the entire Clave, end up a Circle member?<eos> Valentine threatened to wipe out any Shadowhunters who opposed him.<eos> Malachi's just trying to save his own ass.<eos> And sit back while everything around him is destroyed.<eos> How could you side with him?
Let's just get out of here while we can!<eos> She's a smart one.<eos> You should listen to her.<eos> Before I change my mind.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's gonna be OK.<eos> How?<eos> Your father won't approve... but he'll understand your deaths were a necessary sacrifice.<eos> For mass genocide?<eos> You're the Consul of the Clave.

- No. Wet dog, man.<eos> Wet dog. - I'm sticky, I know.<eos> - You are sticky.<eos> I am coming back for you, though.<eos> I will come for you, son.<eos> The sign outside said private party, so I used your name.<eos> - Ollie, this is a private party...<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> Sure, OK.<eos> Well, sure. What do you... what do you want to talk about?

What do you... what do you want to talk about?<eos> I was wondering... how long have you been a werewolf?
I thought I'd get a little jump on things.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Gentlemen, suit up.<eos> In you go.<eos> Let me know what you need.<eos> Fox, come here. Yeah.<eos> There's a lot of snow to cull here.<eos> We're gonna need tents, generators, the whole circus.<eos> I mean, I can put in the call if you like.

You're dismissed.<eos> Sir.<eos> You have kids?<eos> Pets?<eos> Carpet in your TV room?<eos> I have... two kids.<eos> Their DNA is now contaminating the crime scene, the unprocessed crime scene<eos> - that you chose to enter.<eos> - Sir, I swear, I...<eos> Let me tell you something. If one day we're lucky enough to get this guy, I can't have you serving up freebies to his defence attorney.
Body is clothed.<eos> Denim jeans cover the lower portion.<eos> Torn away at the left leg.<eos> There's a spot up top where it looks like water collects.<eos> I bet she's resting on a drain.<eos> Partially detached from her skull.<eos> Filled up around her.<eos> Froze solid.<eos> It's her.<eos> You're sure?
Froze solid.<eos> It's her.<eos> You're sure?<eos> Blue hoodie.<eos> She was wearing it when she disappeared.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, let's do this then.<eos> Let's have our moment.<eos> I'm serious, John.<eos> If you want to say I told you so, now's your chance.
If you want to say I told you so, now's your chance.<eos> I don't have anything to say.<eos> She could have run away.<eos> She could have been with some cousin in Temiskaming.<eos> We didn't know.<eos> That's why you keep looking.<eos> We tried.<eos> We failed.<eos> We moved on.<eos> You should put on that on the crest.
We tried.<eos> We failed.<eos> We moved on.<eos> You should put on that on the crest.<eos> If I make you the lead on this, I need to know that you're not gonna drift.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So McLeod can't be your second.<eos> He's in court all month.<eos> Who then?<eos> You're kidding.
And second?<eos> Never disagree with him.<eos> Sure.<eos> Katie's remains have been transported to the forensics lab in Toronto.<eos> Okay.<eos> It'll take a few days and then we'll release her to you.<eos> There will be more questions and we'll have to go over some ground we've already covered.<eos> I'm sorry to put you through that again.<eos> We're gonna throw everything we have at this, Dorothy.<eos> You said that before.

We're done?<eos> Good night.<eos> And that's the new partner?<eos> What did he want?<eos> He wanted to hear himself talk.<eos> Westbrook building is clear.<eos> I'm gonna head to Chalmers Street.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Who are you?
Westbrook building is clear.<eos> I'm gonna head to Chalmers Street.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Mrs. LaBelle, I am Detective John Cardinal.<eos> I told him not to go in.<eos> Told him to wait until I got back but, you know, he's such a water rat.<eos> That's all he ever wanted to do.<eos> So you're there, for about an hour and then you go back up to the car for cigarettes. Is that right? And how far away was the car, would you say?

Is that right? And how far away was the car, would you say?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Five minutes, if that.<eos> Is there something wrong?<eos> I told all this to the other cop a bunch of times.<eos> Mrs. LaBelle, I know this is difficult.<eos> I'm just, I'm just doing some follow up.<eos> So, gone ten minutes and when you come back that's, that's when you see Billy in the water.

And you stayed pretty late, closed the place down.<eos> What's this got to do with Billy?<eos> I'm just, I'm just trying to get the timeline straight here.<eos> So up until two a.m., having a good time and then first thing next morning with your son at the beach.<eos> Mrs. LaBelle, I couldn't help but notice in the pictures of the scene, I didn't see anything like a blanket or a picnic basket.<eos> Picnic basket?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I don't own a picnic basket.<eos> Mrs. LaBelle, I know this is difficult.<eos> I know you've been through a lot and I'm not here to add to your pain.

I want you to go.<eos> McLeod, you got a minute?<eos> It's forensics on the line.<eos> I could use an extra brain in the room.<eos> Len, it's John.<eos> I've got, Detective McLeod with me.<eos> It's all very preliminary so bear with me.<eos> All right.<eos> Doctor?<eos> Before you start, I wanted to introduce myself.
Hi. It's Detective John Cardinal with the Algonquin Bay Police.<eos> I'm calling about a missing person.<eos> Yeah, thanks for getting back to me.<eos> Question about a find...<eos> Seventeen.<eos> I'm wondering if there's any new information since?<eos> I see.<eos> So he was seen in St. John's?<eos> I'm gonna show you some pictures.<eos> Can you tell me if...?

I know it's an Alberta case but...<eos> I see, so there's a history of...<eos> Can you call me at this number when you have a minute?
What goes there?<eos> Microwave.<eos> I just got the thing.<eos> I didn't even get a chance to install it.<eos> And when was that?<eos> Wednesday.<eos> Is that important?<eos> The fire will burn for four days while Katie's spirit walks the world.<eos> Miss Pine, I'm Noelle Dyson with the Algonquin Bay Police.<eos> I'm so sorry for what you're going through.

Is it me or is everyone looking at us?<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> It's nice to meet...<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> Eyes forward.<eos> Act natural.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> - Listen.<eos> My name is Teresa Del Taco.<eos> And you are in grande danger.

So you drag me over to this fucking aisle with all these illegal products... and now I don't see them.<eos> So where the fuck are they?<eos> Spill the beans!<eos> Beans, I swear to fucking God, if you don't...<eos> - ...shut the fuck up...<eos> - Oh, no. He's back!<eos> Where's Frank?<eos> - They were just here.<eos> - What part of:<eos> "I want the sausage and the bun dead, and if you see them, come and get me... and if I find out that you didn't come and get me... or just couldn't find them good enough, I'll fucking kill your asses"... did you not understand, Tequila?
This happens, you know?<eos> Bro, come here. No, it's fine.<eos> It's cool.<eos> No biggie.<eos> I'm not gonna do something fucked up to you now as soon as I get you in close.<eos> No way, José!<eos> Yes way.<eos> José's fucking dead, yo.<eos> Right in my guac and balls.<eos> And the same thing's gonna happen to all of you... unless you find the sausage and the bun.
As soon as you're out those doors, the gods kill our asses.<eos> What, are you crazy?<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why would the gods kill us?<eos> Because it makes them stronger.<eos> Every kill gives them more power, and it's never enough.<eos> Over the years, they've grown bigger, stronger, fatter.<eos> Their hunger's insatiable, buddy.<eos> I mean, fuck.<eos> You guys are fucking nuts.

You know what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah, he does.<eos> The song had a great hook and it caught on. You know.<eos> In time, everyone accepted this false truth.<eos> But over the years, things started to get a little fucky.<eos> The aisles started changing my verses to support their own views.<eos> Fucking with Twink's lyrics.<eos> Remixing my shit without my permish.<eos> Now every morning when I hear the song, I'm like:<eos> "What the fuck are you guys saying?"
I'm tweaked!<eos> I'm tweaking!<eos> Whoa, dude!<eos> Just take it easy, just breathe, dude, just breathe.<eos> You're not tweaking, you're just peaking, man.<eos> Just be with me.<eos> Be cool.<eos> This wave's gotta crash.<eos> I can't!<eos> You're all alive and looking at me with your...
A little sausage with some pretty big news.<eos> Everything we've been led to believe is a lie.<eos> When we get chosen by the gods, they're choosing us for death.<eos> Murder.<eos> Automatic expiration.<eos> The Great Beyond is bullshit.<eos> - What?<eos> - That's crazy talk!<eos> You liar!<eos> I know you don't wanna believe it, but I have proof!
Come on.<eos> Sing.<eos> - Do it. - No!<eos> Don't do it, Corn.<eos> - Come on, Larry.<eos> You can do it.<eos> - Start.<eos> Don't you dare fucking do it, Corn.<eos> Don't you fucking do it.<eos> Dear gods You're so divine in each and every way
Let me tell you the story of my stupid fucking death.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Five-second rule.<eos> No!<eos> And then they figured out how to drive my car, snuck into an AC vent... and that pretty much brings us up-to-date.<eos> Get the fuck away from me.<eos> Frank, I'm sorry.<eos> When you guys fell out of that cart, I could have done something, but I didn't.
Stay away from my sausage, you skank!<eos> Frank.<eos> Brenda.<eos> Look, I'm so sorry.<eos> I've been dealing with this whole thing incredibly poorly.<eos> You really have.<eos> Honestly, it's been pathetic at times.<eos> But luckily, it's not too late.<eos> Come on.<eos> You see?
At least we go out together.<eos> - What the...?<eos> - You fuck with them...<eos> You fuck with us, bitch.<eos> Run, guys!<eos> We're out of ladies.<eos> Hop on, y'all.<eos> - Can't this thing go any faster?<eos> - Suck my pink cock.<eos> Come on, you candy asses.
- You fuck with them...<eos> You fuck with us, bitch.<eos> Run, guys!<eos> We're out of ladies.<eos> Hop on, y'all.<eos> - Can't this thing go any faster?<eos> - Suck my pink cock.<eos> Come on, you candy asses.<eos> Join the fight!<eos> Hey, what do you think?
- You ready for this?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's better to die a free candy than to live in bondage.<eos> This is gonna hurt so fucking much.<eos> Run, guys, run!<eos> Sergeant Pepper, cue the fruits!<eos> Fruits are a go.<eos> Go, fruits!<eos> No.<eos> Get away from me, you fucking fruits!
Kiss it, Frank.<eos> Kiss me there!<eos> Oh, yeah, Frank, that's it.<eos> Oh, yeah, it's dinnertime.<eos> Yo.<eos> I'm actually over here jerking off with these fellas.<eos> Once you go taco, you never go "back-o."<eos> Jesus fucking Christ!<eos> Hey, fellas.<eos> You thinking what I'm thinking?
- It was in front of us the whole time.<eos> I love you, Brenda.<eos> I love you, Frank.<eos> You know, my boner still hasn't gone down.<eos> Is that bad?<eos> Bad for my asshole, I'll tell you that much.<eos> Seriously, though, your recovery time is off the charts.<eos> Guys!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You have to come with me right now.
Is that bad?<eos> Bad for my asshole, I'll tell you that much.<eos> Seriously, though, your recovery time is off the charts.<eos> Guys!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You have to come with me right now.<eos> Hello there, little sausage.<eos> You and your friends have accomplished the impossible.<eos> And for that, I give you mad props.<eos> But now that you have shattered one truth, it is time for you to learn... that we are not real!
Are you kidding me?
It is really important, but we've got kind of a crisis.<eos> This is what corporate wants us to give everyone for Christmas. Just this.<eos> Yeah, can't hand that out.<eos> And I'm already feeling kind of a<eos> "fuck you" vibe down there, definitely not Christmas spirit.<eos> I can't argue with you there.<eos> Good. I want to Secret Santa the shit out of the staff meeting. Come on.<eos> Can we work and walk?<eos> Allison, hold most of my calls, not all of them.<eos> No, where are you going?
Clay, why don't you have a seat? No.<eos> It's my branch, so I prefer to stand.<eos> Fine.<eos> Allison, would you please remove Clay's chair?<eos> -Sure.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Thank you, Allison.<eos> So we were all a little bit disappointed not to hit 7% growth in this last quarter. But 6.5% is right on industry standard for the fall.<eos> You need to hit 1 2%. -"Twelve"?
6.5% is not failing.<eos> -Yes, it is.<eos> -We're doing better than Orlando.<eos> I mean, half those jack-offs had mono last year, right?<eos> Well, I closed the Orlando branch. This morning.<eos> What?<eos> I am sorry. Damn it.<eos> I hate tension, and I... I farted.<eos> You are not selling enough servers.<eos> You have no new ideas and there is no new revenue.
So we can already connect to the Internet through standard electrical lines and obviously we can do it through the air.<eos> But what if we could combine those technologies?<eos> With Zenotek AnywAir, you can pull the Internet wirelessly from anything that's connected to a power grid.<eos> Your appliances. Street lights.<eos> A light bulb. You're never out of range, and you're never low on signal.<eos> It's AnywAir.<eos> We're in the future.<eos> And you can deliver that?<eos> I'm still figuring out some coding issues, but yes.<eos> Well, how long have you been figuring?
And if you forget again, it's on all of the recent patents for Zenotek. You know what?<eos> I'm gonna sit.<eos> So...<eos> -Is there anything else?<eos> -Actually, yes.<eos> This is a sample cheeseboard for our holiday mixer tonight.<eos> I know it's a little heavy on the Gouda... That was the MVP last year.<eos> I do have a feisty Cheddar on the bench. I think that pairs better with the mulled non-alcoholic wine myself, but what do I know?<eos> Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Excuse me.<eos> You're having a Christmas party tonight?
Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> You okay?<eos> Dad gave you a free pass your entire life, and you're not getting one from me.<eos> The only way you're gonna hit your targets this year is by cutting jobs.<eos> Hey, what if we landed the Data City account?<eos> -Data City?<eos> Walter Davis?<eos> -That's right.<eos> You do know that he's already met with HP, Cisco and Oracle.
Lawsuit! Mary, it's for the greater good, okay?<eos> Joel, would you do me a favor? Would you get Fred up to Clay's office?<eos> -Yeah, sure. -Thank you.<eos> -Wait! -Yup.<eos> I don't know if it's helpful, but regarding the music tonight, I happen to have a friend who's a pretty good DJ.<eos> Great.<eos> Bring him. -See, we already got a DJ.<eos> -Yep. So let me get this straight.<eos> Now we're having this great party and we're getting our bonuses at it.<eos> Yes, Jeremy, because you deserve it!
That's nice.<eos> Hey, look at that!<eos> -Hi.<eos> -Hey, there, Susan.<eos> -Nice reindeer, right?<eos> -How you doin'?<eos> Throw that in coat check for me, please. Thank you. You look great.<eos> -Hey, Josh. -Hey, Dean.<eos> You...<eos> You thought you'd bring the kid? Yeah.
Throw that in coat check for me, please. Thank you. You look great.<eos> -Hey, Josh. -Hey, Dean.<eos> You...<eos> You thought you'd bring the kid? Yeah.<eos> We couldn't get anyone to watch him.<eos> But don't worry, he has an iPad.<eos> We could ax murder each other and he wouldn't even notice.<eos> He'll just sit there with that dumb look on his face.<eos> Yeah, that's the one.<eos> Well, can you stick him in my office for me?
I'm not looking to get pregnant tonight. Excuse me.<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> joel, that's a red card for you.<eos> Babies are not getting made tonight, not here on company property.<eos> If you're going to have intercourse, please go beyond the flood lamps at the perimeter of the plaza and into the Rite Aid parking lot.<eos> That's right. 'Cause we fucking tonight!<eos> joel. Language.<eos> This is still an office, and even though it's dark outside, the rules don't turn off.<eos> The rules may not turn off, but your inhibitions can! I'm talking about take your pee-pees out and put 'em in some booties!<eos> And remember that tonight the decisions you make will have consequences that will haunt you for the rest of your professional lives.

And so have fun.<eos> Yeah, Mary, way to psyche everybody up!<eos> main takeaway, if you're gonna fuck, do it in the parking lot. Turn it up!
You feel dirty?<eos> You're my third client tonight. It's only 9:00 p.m. Really?<eos> So, you just have to pay my manager, and then we're, like, good.<eos> Yeah... Got it right here. Hi.<eos> -Nate?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Hi, I'm Trina.<eos> I don't do handshakes, I do hugs.<eos> Get in here. Yeah.<eos> Oh, my gosh, you guys are gonna have so much fun tonight.
This is useless.<eos> You gonna be solo?<eos> There's not gonna be a stocking on your mantel for Jimmy Butler at your place?<eos> -What are you doing?<eos> -Nothing?<eos> Just asking.<eos> You know?<eos> You could have dated me, Josh. But you freaked out and ran away.<eos> I still had PTSD from my marriage just ending, so...<eos> You'd been separated for a year.
-Hey!<eos> -Hey, man.<eos> What's up, guys?<eos> Good thing I wasn't going number two, huh?<eos> Yeah. Leave you to it.<eos> -This is my territory!<eos> -Got it. That's clear.<eos> They can't shut us down!<eos> We're never gonna get shut down!<eos> When I say Zeno, you say Tek

I'm going next. -No, I called it.<eos> I called it. -No, no, wait.<eos> -I'm so happy for you!<eos> -Shit. I was about to do my balls!<eos> Hey! What about the 3D printer?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Yes! -Yeah?<eos> Excuse me. Excuse me!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Raise your hands if you're keeping your jobs!
I called it. -No, no, wait.<eos> -I'm so happy for you!<eos> -Shit. I was about to do my balls!<eos> Hey! What about the 3D printer?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Yes! -Yeah?<eos> Excuse me. Excuse me!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Raise your hands if you're keeping your jobs!<eos> Raise your hands if you're gonna get a bonus! Excuse me.
This is so amazing to meet guys we can actually connect with, you know.<eos> Yeah. There we go.<eos> -Amazing. -Absolutely. They're full of shit, okay?<eos> They're not your soulmates. They just hacked your Facebook.<eos> -That's horseshit!<eos> -Unbelievable. So uncool.<eos> -Hey, wait!<eos> -No, no, no, girls!<eos> I knew you didn't like the Gilmore Girls.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna need both of you assclowns to hack into Clay's phone so we can find him.
-Great.<eos> -Hey, Josh. -Yeah?<eos> -Great news. Jimmy Butler asked me to DJ his parties, his after-parties, and his hungover next-morning brunches.<eos> Well, that is great news, Joel.<eos> Actually, it's Calvis now.<eos> And forever.<eos> Joel is dead.<eos> Get the desk.<eos> Okay, give me the wires. Plug it in here.<eos> Give me that. Hey, I could use some of that giddy-up in HR if you two ponies are looking for a new stable.
Joel is dead.<eos> Get the desk.<eos> Okay, give me the wires. Plug it in here.<eos> Give me that. Hey, I could use some of that giddy-up in HR if you two ponies are looking for a new stable.<eos> I am looking for a new stable, Mary. Thank you so much.<eos> We'll talk later. Mary, you're showing a lot of neck. Breaking your own rules.<eos> It's a little skanky, isn't it?<eos> -Plug it in.<eos> -Plugged in.<eos> I got this DJ equipment, if you want to use that for something.
Or I blow up the power grid.<eos> -So be ready for that.<eos> -Okay? Don't worry about that.<eos> Just hit "Enter."<eos> Okay, guys. Here we go.<eos> Power's still on.<eos> Yeah, I'm honestly shocked by that.<eos> No Internet yet, though.<eos> It could take a few seconds.<eos> If it works, you'll have a connection alert. -No.
-Was that you? -I got it!<eos> Yeah, I got it, too!<eos> I got mine!<eos> Yeah. Yeah, there's mine.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> -Tracey!<eos> Work never stops. You see that?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hello, yes. I am happy for you, but I do need you to sign a personal relationship disclosure form before this rounds first. No.
Yeah?<eos> I'll see you on Monday.<eos> Well, it looks like we just hired Walter Davis.<eos> Well, he'll fit right in.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> -What are you doing?<eos> -Winner! -We weren't even racing.<eos> -Well, you weren't.<eos> Why do you think they always make you leave a hospital in a wheelchair?<eos> What are you guys doing here?
You mean Alex, her husband?<eos> No, her and Armand.<eos> Alex hasn't been around in forever.<eos> - Who's Armand?<eos> - Their boy.<eos> Boy?<eos> - Bianca has a child?<eos> - It's not hers. It's Alex's kid.<eos> How do you not know this?<eos> You guys don't talk much?
So, yeah, these guys, they can handle themselves.<eos> I'm telling you, Mike. Me and Marcus go way back.<eos> It ain't Marcus I'm worried about.<eos> All right. We go in two weeks.<eos> What the fuck is that supposed to mean?<eos> I just don't get how you can love a dog more than a chick is all.<eos> Well, you got a girlfriend, now you can talk about women, huh?<eos> Hey, Russell, where did you say your brother met that girlfriend he has now, the one he's in love with?<eos> I need you all to tighten it up for me now.<eos> Hey, you heard him.
Working on a game plan. One sec.<eos> I'm On it!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Everybody in the vault!<eos> Gabe, remember, north on Hill and east on Ninth.<eos> Copy. North on Hill and east on Ninth.<eos> Go!<eos> Yeah!<eos> That's what I'm talking about!<eos> Yeah! RUSSELL". Okay, you're approaching an intersection.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, like I was planning that shit!<eos> God damn it, Gabe, you still a fucking amateur.<eos> What the fuck!<eos> Shut up!<eos> The fuck you thinking you greedy piece of shit?<eos> They put the bait in there for dumb fucks like you!<eos> Marcus! Put your shit in the trunk, man.<eos> - Bitch!<eos> - Three days.<eos> Unless you hear from me different. Yeah, you know what?
Bullshit.<eos> How many cop funerals have you been to in the last five years, huh?<eos> And you tell yourself the same thing that every cop sitting there tells himself.<eos> "Better him than me."<eos> If you're having a problem with this, Marcus,<eos> I'll do it.<eos> I don't have a problem taking out a cop.<eos> I'll do a cop just like...<eos> Oh, ho, ho. A little to the right.<eos> What are you doing in there, Uncle Jeff?
So don't worry about me. No. lam worried about you.<eos> You don't realize... Any one of these little fucking snake-eyed motherfuckers, you know, could be strapped right now.<eos> I owe it to your mother.<eos> I owe it to her.<eos> Look, it... I can't look after you...<eos> Fuckthese motherfuckers.<eos> Any one of these cock...<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey! Are any of you cocksuckers strapped right now?<eos> You? Jeff...
Chris, come on, man.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You all right?<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> South side, heading east.<eos> Marcus, give me your 20, man.<eos> Hands! Show me your hands!<eos> Get on the ground!<eos> Get on the ground!<eos> Hey, did you see somebody? Where'd they go?
This is a cop's brain on some shit.<eos> This is a cop asshole.<eos> This is a cop's asshole in supermax.<eos> Any questions?<eos> That's a big asshole.<eos> Hey, I've got to talk to you.<eos> Who the fuck is this? Don't worry, boys. Wait.<eos> Hey, Jack, get them some drinks.<eos> Man, come on, get them some drinks.<eos> All right, you got it.
- Advise if responding.<eos> - Shots fired on scene.<eos> All units copy. Triple 9.<eos> Eighth and Washington.<eos> There it is!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Wrong entrance.<eos> Back it up.<eos> Back it up.<eos> You guys have been here before.
All right, up! On your feet.<eos> Hands up. Come here.<eos> Against the wall!<eos> Come on. Move!<eos> - Come on. Down. Down!<eos> - All right.<eos> I need a unit for a 211-Adam in progress at DHS Holding.<eos> Repeat. 211-Adam.<eos> Should we respond to that?<eos> Are you guys hearing this 211?
Repeat. 211-Adam.<eos> Should we respond to that?<eos> Are you guys hearing this 211?<eos> Yeah, I fucking hear it!<eos> Northwest corner of Eighth and Washington. He's lucid.<eos> Officer is down.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> All right.<eos> That's good enough, right there.<eos> You're going to do exactly what we ask of you.
All right.<eos> That's good enough, right there.<eos> You're going to do exactly what we ask of you.<eos> You got 10 times that amount strapped to your head.<eos> We can't open the vault.<eos> It's on a rotating time lock.<eos> There's no override.<eos> Received. Any units in vicinity?<eos> Fuck me! Send the other car!<eos> Ling, you guys are on the 211.
- Amazing.<eos> Hi, good to see you. [engine revving]<eos> - Concert starts in five.<eos> [applause]<eos> And we want to thank you all for being here tonight.<eos> All right, let's sync them up, boys.<eos> You got ten minutes to get to Regent's office, crack that safe, grab the money, throw it down the garbage chute and then get the hell out of there before anybody knows what's hit them.<eos> Now please join me in welcoming the Giving City Children's Choir.<eos> And without further ado, I would like to introduce our choirmaster, Renee.<eos> [applause] You got a match? Well, send it over!
-So spending time with family is suddenly important to you now?<eos> -Look, he can come here tomorrow morning for breakfast.<eos> We can drive down to Boca during the day, maybe play a round of golf or two, then he'd be back here in Atlanta the next day.<eos> He can't just flake off for two days!<eos> The risk versus reward here is just...<eos> I don't see it happening.<eos> It's what she would have wanted, that's all.<eos> But if you have to get ready for your wedding, if you're that busy...<eos> I just don't understand why he wants you to take him.<eos> You're not even that close.
-Yeah. Good to see you. We're going to Daytona Beach for the week.<eos> My God, and we should have been there three fucking hours ago, so let's go, bitches!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You're just really gay.<eos> Am I? Thanks, Captain Gaydar.<eos> Jesus! You know, I'm also black, right?<eos> Yeah, I know. That's funny too.<eos> So you guys wanna tag along for a bit maybe? Party some babies into us?
Jason? Can we just do this please?<eos> "Can we do this now?"<eos> "Jason Richard Kelly, son of..."<eos> "Doctor Smegma Von BoxMunchers."<eos> "David and Brooke, "is a junior associate at the law firm of..."<eos> "Cream pie fart and donkey punch!" Okay, who is that?<eos> It's no one.<eos> It's a waiter with pretty bad Tourette's, I think...<eos> He just keeps walking by yelling weird shit, I don't know why...<eos> Okay, well, what restaurant are you at?

I don't know why you're there, but you'd better call me from your grandfather's house when you get there tonight, okay?
What else don't I know about you? -How the hell do you know how to speak Arabic?<eos> Dad's never said anything about that.<eos> That's because your dad doesn't really know much about me.<eos> I was away with the army during most of his childhood. So we were never that close.<eos> Is that why he doesn't like you?<eos> Anybody work here?<eos> -Okay, everybody on the fucking floor!<eos> This is a goddamn robbery!<eos> On the fucking ground!<eos> My God, you should see your faces!
What, did you just come from skiing? -Yeah, I skied in, just to see you save the world.<eos> One Jell-O shot at a time.<eos> High-five!<eos> You want me to do your back?<eos> Only if you promise to do my front first.<eos> Gladly. Whoops!<eos> That never usually happens.<eos> Really?<eos> It happens to me all the time. Well, guess who just took a shit in the water?<eos> We've been looking for you bitches all day.
Yeah.<eos> That's Cody and Brah.<eos> They're on the lacrosse team at Florida.<eos> This guy plays lacrosse?<eos> All-conference, brah! Yeah? Which one, the fucking Diabetes Conference?<eos> All right, we're about to boat race a bunch of those fucks from the University of Georgia up in the room.<eos> So... My God!<eos> University of Georgia! No way!<eos> You're a Hornet?<eos> Afraid so. Well, you guys should get in there then,
Chug! Chug!<eos> Chug!<eos> Go! Go!<eos> It's actually kind of fun.<eos> Yeah, I'm not really, you know, for sure, per say what we're doing after graduation.<eos> I mean, we have offers to play...<eos> -Blah, blah, blah professional lacrosse in Europe, but a bunch of agents Words, words, words... also want us to start modeling, so...<eos> And again, we're talking about this fat fuck right here?<eos> You guys...<eos> You have to come see this right now.
They're both crack.<eos> What? And you have taken an amount that will probably kill you in about 30 minutes.<eos> I just smoked crack?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> But just, like, a lot.<eos> I just smoked crack.<eos> I just smoked crack!<eos> USA!<eos> USA!<eos> USA! Told you.
Shit.<eos> Let me down.<eos> Did everybody get a picture of that?<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> -I can't do this...<eos> -What? God...<eos> -The winners Of the Alpha Delta Flex Off...<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Guys? -Where are you going?
Thank you, Doctor.<eos> Okay. They're in the hospital till tomorrow!<eos> The room's ours for the night.<eos> Look at these fucking people.<eos> How was brunch at Hitler's house that day?<eos> Hey, Grandpa, who else in our family knows that you were, Special Forces or whatever?<eos> No one, once your grandmother passed.<eos> Your father stopped talking to me before my missions were declassified.<eos> So he always thought I was just an army mechanic.<eos> But don't you think that you guys would get along a little better if you told him?
Please. We have two hot, smart, beautiful college girls at the peak of their sexual powers about to meet us at one of the last great nightclubs in Florida.<eos> Worry about them.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't think you're very popular here, Grandpa.<eos> You're the one that's going to have to watch out.<eos> You might get Oreo'd.<eos> Oreo'd? That's when two black guys fuck a white guy.<eos> You're the cream in the middle.<eos> Game on.<eos> Hey! Glad you guys made it.

Glad you guys made it.<eos> Let's go get fucked up.<eos> Right? -My stepdad hates me!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Party till you're pregnant!
Yup.<eos> I probably could have still had sex if she just threw up on her front, but she somehow got it all over her back, and I would have felt bad.<eos> Well, chivalry isn't dead.<eos> I like the way you took that haymaker tonight.<eos> Sometimes you just gotta take that punch up front, you know?<eos> Then things get easier in the long run.<eos> "De Oppresso Liber." It's written on your knife too.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Hey, lights out after 12:00, boys.<eos> I better not catch you swimming across the lake to the girls' camp, okay?
You're not a real professor? -My God! You lied to us.<eos> How could you.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, this is the best part.<eos> This is the best part. Richard "Dick" Kelly, Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army, also known as the American Gladiator "Nitro."<eos> What the fuck did you Google?<eos> Okay, well, there's another best part then.<eos> "Jason Patrick Kelly will wed Meredith Miriam Goldstein "at Jericho Temple on Saturday, March 27th."<eos> Wait, that's...<eos> next Saturday.<eos> Wait, you're grandfather and grandson?
Pam, you know him?<eos> Barry?<eos> Yeah, he's, like, my best friend.<eos> I sold him, like, six tons of ecstasy...!<eos> That's why they're not stopping the bus.<eos> It's full of drugs.<eos> Classic Pam.<eos> I know that man.<eos> -Stop the bus!<eos> Jason, where are you going?
What if I come with you?<eos> Come...<eos> Really?<eos> -I mean... I just broke up with my fiancee, lost my job.<eos> And I think I'm wanted by the police, so...<eos> A year at sea might actually be the best place for me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Break it up, lesbians!<eos> Let's go. Get down on the ground!<eos> We're doing this because you're lesbians!
2 Bravo Gulf, permission to land, Deepwater Horizon.<eos> Permission granted, 2 Bravo Gulf.<eos> - Beginning our descent.<eos> - Roger that.<eos> Welcome aboard!<eos> You guys already done?<eos> I don't know what to tell you, Mr. Jimmy.<eos> - Hey, you guys finished?<eos> - I don't know what to tell you, Mike. - Somebody's gotta talk to Vidrine.<eos> - What? Are you finished?
- Blue screen 0' death again.<eos> Hey, Duck, is your chair still up?<eos> My computer screen is shaky. And my smoke detector's out.<eos> How you doing, Mike?<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm gonna dump my bags and grab my tools and I'll be back to fix it.<eos> Doing it all with Band-Aids and bubble gum, my man.<eos> Every time I peel off a Band-Aid on this rig, I find three or four more.<eos> Spit and glue ain't getting it done.<eos> One more time with the "money". Come on. Come on, you been rehearsing for weeks.
- Yes.<eos> Had enough time, huh?<eos> Takes time to do it right.<eos> I mean, if that cement job is compromised then everything above it is, too.<eos> Well, it's not compromised. Houston doesn't have a problem.<eos> So I assume Schlumberger guys said the same?<eos> Cement bond log they ran said the same, yeah?<eos> We are confident in the integrity of our cement job, are we not?<eos> Oh, we quite comfortable with the integrity of that cement, that for true.<eos> You guys are just like my granddad.
We got to go.<eos> Now, how quick can we lock the door on this well?<eos> I'm not doing nothing until Mr. Jimmy's made aware.<eos> Is there a man among you?<eos> Is there an adult here?<eos> You all got the paraphernalia.<eos> The dip. The steel toes.<eos> But it's all bullshit.<eos> We got zero pressure on the kill line.<eos> You nervous as cats. Afraid to make it work at every turn.
I know that.<eos> Two and a half?<eos> Two and a half.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Look. If we ever were stranded, say, near the wilderness...<eos> We would handle it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Boom. - Oh!<eos> Whose turn is it?<eos> - You. - You distracted us.
Hey, there's some kind of lookout up here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, Mikey.<eos> No.<eos> Mikey.<eos> All right, just stay put, okay?<eos> Don't move.<eos> Gary!<eos> - What's up?<eos> - There you are.
Come on.<eos> Come on, Mikey.<eos> No.<eos> Mikey.<eos> All right, just stay put, okay?<eos> Don't move.<eos> Gary!<eos> - What's up?<eos> - There you are.<eos> Where'd you go, guys?
Why do I get blamed for everything in this family?<eos> Honey, you know that's not true.<eos> It is.<eos> You and Mom, we never talk about anything.<eos> We never talk about him. We never talk about how he affects all of us.<eos> We do.<eos> We do. We talk about...<eos> No, you and Mom just ignore it.<eos> We never talk about the creepy stuff he does.<eos> It's getting creepier and creepier and you just let him get away with it.
Michael.<eos> Hey, sweetie, what're you doing?<eos> I kept hearing weird noises last night. Freaked myself out, so I came in here.<eos> What kind of noises?<eos> Can you tell Michael to stay out of my room?<eos> He keeps leaving dirty hand marks everywhere.<eos> Hey, big guy.<eos> Something's bugging you, huh?<eos> Hey, Jeff. I was just seeing what was up with your dog.<eos> What you got, a new cat over there or something?
She's like wind spirits and water spirits...<eos> Believe me, if I told you the crazy shit she was telling us about, you'd laugh.<eos> She tells us what to do, and we do it.<eos> Everything she says, we do it to the letter. We do what she says.<eos> A week later, he's better.<eos> There's like life in his eyes again, and then four weeks later, he's playing baseball.<eos> So, is that a miracle?<eos> I don't know what you call it.<eos> Tell Bronny to call Wendy. She'll tell her more about it.<eos> But you've got to call this woman, I'm telling ya.
So there you go.<eos> He was brutally attacked, and in your head, the man who did it was inhuman, a monster.<eos> It wasn't a man, though.<eos> The cops said that dogs, scratched up the screen door, and he chased them off into the woods.<eos> And the coroner said he had a heart attack.<eos> And the cops said... that dogs go for the soft parts.<eos> They DNA tested the fork and it had animal DNA.<eos> So, that's case closed.<eos> He sounds like an extraordinary gentleman.<eos> Were you very close?
Yeah?<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Abe?<eos> No!<eos> You're Emma!<eos> And the twins.<eos> And Olive.<eos> And Bronwyn.<eos> And he's Millard.<eos> No, you're dead.
That's awesome.<eos> Abe?<eos> No!<eos> You're Emma!<eos> And the twins.<eos> And Olive.<eos> And Bronwyn.<eos> And he's Millard.<eos> No, you're dead.<eos> All of you, you're all dead.
What?<eos> No, I'm, I'm... Not. I'm a tourist.<eos> I say we should get the truth out of him, the old-fashioned way.<eos> Get down!<eos> Come on!<eos> Jake, get on!<eos> Come on!<eos> Get on, boy!<eos> I can't believe you're real.<eos> You're all real!
This is Claire.<eos> Millard, pass the ball.<eos> We're playing together.<eos> Millard you met.<eos> Come on!<eos> And that's Hugh.<eos> Stop cheating, Hugh.<eos> Millard, that's a foul again.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> If you two can't play soccer without squabbling, I do wish you wouldn't play at all.
I nearly messed that up.<eos> Abe did too, the first time.<eos> This used to be his job.<eos> Emma, I need to tell you something.<eos> He's dead.<eos> I know.<eos> Miss Peregrine guessed, and she's always right.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I said goodbye to him a long time ago.<eos> Were you close?
What do you mean, hunting?<eos> They raided loops.<eos> Whole homes full of children left for dead.<eos> Abe took lives to save lives.<eos> He only retired when you were born to protect you.<eos> From what?<eos> If I tell you the rest, you have to promise not to run away.<eos> Jake, you belong here.<eos> You know I don't.<eos> I'm not like you.
Shall we?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Wait for me.<eos> I mustn't forget our calendar.<eos> Could you fetch it from the parlor please, Miss Avocet?<eos> Go and help the others.<eos> Miss Peregrine, what a pleasure to meet you at last!<eos> May we come in?<eos> Children!<eos> Would you make your way down the stairs, please?
If you value his life, I suggest everyone does as they're told.<eos> Children!<eos> No one tells my children what to do!<eos> Children. Come down here please.<eos> Miss Peregrine...<eos> I thought I told you to be quiet.<eos> Children... for Jake's safety... we're going to do what Mr. Barron asks.<eos> He wishes to take me with him to his rendezvous in Blackpool.<eos> So, for his protection... he'd like me to assume bird form, preferably caged.<eos> He'd like you to make your way into a lockable room, such as the parlor... as he won't release Jake if he fears an attack could be mounted upon him once he loses his leverage.
Only Jake can see them.<eos> She means he's our only hope.<eos> It's been my privilege... to care for you all.<eos> Goodbye, my children.<eos> Now let him go.<eos> Promise me one thing, Jake.<eos> That you will try to look after them all.<eos> I promise.<eos> It's getting dark.<eos> You won't even be able to see their shadows.
Welcome to the family, Jake.<eos> Now, I can't talk long, so just tell Miss Peregrine, I'm at the air base and I'm fine.<eos> I just wanted to say that, I miss you... and if I disappointed you... I'm sorry.<eos> You're the best grandpa in the world.<eos> Quickly.<eos> Fiona.<eos> Got ii.<eos> Miss Avocet.<eos> Now, children.<eos> Now that you're all here, there's a few rules.
But Blackpool is miles away.<eos> The next ferry doesn't go for hours. We'll never make it in time.<eos> Not unless we go by boat, too.<eos> So, there's a loop here in Blackpool.<eos> It's only six months old. January 11th, 2016.<eos> With Miss Avocet gone, it can't be reset.<eos> Won't the loop close?<eos> Then ifs back to real time.<eos> Jake, you know what this means, don't you?<eos> You're gonna die.
I could see my grandpa.<eos> Listen, I can explain everything to them.<eos> I can persuade them to take me to the island and...<eos> Wait, will you still be there?<eos> Our old loop's gone for good.<eos> We wouldn't see each other again.<eos> I thought you wanted me to stay.<eos> I know you'll choose Abe.<eos> If I minded, I wouldn't have told you.<eos> So, have you found Miss Avocet's loop on the map yet?
Our brethren should be joining us momentarily.<eos> This is a day to...<eos> Hey!<eos> You down there!<eos> We killed your Hollow friend, Mr. Barron.<eos> And now we've come for Miss Peregrine.<eos> Bring her and all the other Ymbrynes to the end of the pier in five minutes, or face the consequences.<eos> These children must be as insane as their headmistress.<eos> Still, the Hollows will be glad of a feed.<eos> Where are you?
Do I not look like a man who has searched the globe, looking for just one more eye to eat, in hopes of regaining sufficient humanity to return to his research?<eos> A man who's spent years hunting Ymbrynes, in preparation for this night, and two, no, three days, in Wales, pretending to look at birds!<eos> I assure you,<eos> I will not stand idly by... to see my destiny derailed.<eos> Hugh, do it now!<eos> Come back here!<eos> Get them!<eos> Go.<eos> Get down!<eos> You think you can stand in my way?
No, wait. It's me!<eos> Enoch!<eos> We need to go.<eos> The loop is closing.<eos> Those of us who are leaving.<eos> Emma.<eos> You love your grandfather.<eos> There's nothing more to explain.<eos> No, I promised Miss Peregrine I'd look after you all.<eos> And with her injured, and you without a loop...
There's nothing more to explain.<eos> No, I promised Miss Peregrine I'd look after you all.<eos> And with her injured, and you without a loop...<eos> She'll recover.<eos> And until then, we'll be in 1943.<eos> We'll only age one day at a time.<eos> Like normal people.<eos> Which can be no bad thing.<eos> And what about the Hollows?<eos> As long as they're out there, you're not safe.
Mr. Ansari.<eos> Look you can't trust these spooks, man.<eos> Free the mullah!<eos> Keep it brief.<eos> Tell them he'll be released after questioning.<eos> Get this crowd under control.<eos> Free the mullah!<eos> Free him!<eos> Brothers, you all know me.<eos> I know you're angry about these attacks on our community.
Are you food or are you sex?<eos> She's dessert because she's so sweet.<eos> Shouldn't we get back to the party?<eos> Don't talk.<eos> Still.<eos> So what do we think?<eos> I think that I wish I had your hair.<eos> Is this your natural color?<eos> You are just so beautiful.<eos> Don't you think that she's just perfect?
212.<eos> All right, asshole. Party's over.<eos> Open up.<eos> Give me the key.<eos> Mikey, open the door.<eos> Mikey.<eos> The fuck?<eos> You're paying for this.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> You fucking kids are all the fucking same.
Apparently, they think she is gonna be this giant star.<eos> Jack shoots me all the time.<eos> That's not gonna last.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means your expiration date is almost due.<eos> Who wants sour milk when you can get fresh meat?<eos> Right.<eos> Sarah, these girls come and go all the time.<eos> She's not special yet. Mmm...<eos> But you have to admit, there is something about her.
- Bye!<eos> Have a happy day!<eos> Good morning!<eos> Morning, Your Honor.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Bless you.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Bye!<eos> Daddy's making dinner!<eos> "If my name were Bobby Would you ask about my hobbies?
They don't have feathers?<eos> You know, they're just walking around naked, just presenting themselves.<eos> I'm looking at all their business here.<eos> That part about them I really admire.<eos> Now we would like to welcome our special guests, the pigs!<eos> All right!<eos> Thank you for your kindness and hospitality.<eos> Our king sends his warmest regards.<eos> "King"?<eos> You have shared with us the wonders of your quaint, simple little island.
Squad goals!<eos> Look at those jiggly pigglies!<eos> But that's not all.<eos> Throwing things just got a whole lot easier.<eos> Say hello to the slingshot!<eos> - I can't see.<eos> - This is crazy!<eos> - Tired of carrying things from place to place?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Wish you could just get it there?

- Hey!<eos> - Ho!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Ho!<eos> There's more of them!<eos> Hey!<eos> Ho!<eos> That's right, I'm back.<eos> Enjoying the party, everyone?<eos> Because while you were living it up, I snuck onto their boat.
I did not know you felt that way.<eos> Class dismissed!<eos> And now we've come to the prestigious Palms district.<eos> Where birds of all feathers flock together with eight kinds of fruit and nut trees.<eos> Suck those bellies in.<eos> Insta-ham!<eos> Is that what I think it is?<eos> That's an egg.<eos> That's how our children are born.<eos> You guys don't lay eggs?
Very good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The assignment was "Paint Your Pain," so I painted your pain.<eos> It's actually the first in a series.<eos> Here you go.<eos> This one is nice.<eos> I call this one Catharsis.<eos> And I call this one Bye-Bye.<eos> Wonderful likeness.<eos> I thought you said you stored your nuts for winter.

This is what Mama talked about!<eos> Be honest, do I sound any wiser?<eos> Way wiser.<eos> You were kind of dumb before.<eos> I can say that now.<eos> That water is no joke.<eos> I can literally taste the intelligence and wisdom circulating through my body now.<eos> Guys, nobody's here.<eos> I mean, nobody's used this place in years.<eos> What are you doing?
Red, I've found the meaning of life.<eos> It's...<eos> Shut your wormhole.<eos> It's him.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> No. No. No.<eos> Horrible turn of events.<eos> Horrible.<eos> Well, not so much the Lake of Wisdom, it's more like the Lake of Whiz.<eos> Did you just come here to look at me?

Bring it home, mamacita.<eos> Get outta town.<eos> What the...<eos> Those are some old-school moves there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> Yes!<eos> So, he's kind of a wackadoodle.<eos> You know, that doesn't mean he's not wise.<eos> Hey, are you tired of filling your balloons with heavy old air?

But how do we get from here to there?<eos> I am not aquatic in the least.<eos> Well, you know...<eos> We're gonna build our own boat.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They stole your kids...<eos> No.<eos> They stole our kids.<eos> I mean, who does that?<eos> Have you ever stolen anyone's children?

Drop your nuts and move your butts!<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I wasn't expecting this.<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> That guy's the king?<eos> He's got to have the eggs with him in the castle.<eos> - What the heck's a castle?<eos> - And that's where we're going.<eos> Hey, guys, do you remember everything you learned in my class?
You go out there and you show them how frightening mimes can be.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> We're having a feast We're eating the eggs<eos> Gonna have a big feast We're gonna eat all the eggs<eos> What?<eos> What is that?<eos> Fire!<eos> That guy again.<eos> Citizens of Pig Island, if you spot any birds destroying your neighborhood, please, capture them.
I gotta be honest, you look a little...<eos> Fine.<eos> You look fine. Come on.<eos> Bomb's on his way.<eos> Call in the Piggy Air Force!<eos> My loyal subjects, the treacherous birds have repaid our friendship with an unprovoked act of aggression.<eos> The attack will fail.<eos> We have glass, we have wood, we have TNT.<eos> We tried to kill them with kindness, and now we're just gonna have to...<eos> - Well, you know. - Bye-bye.
But you didn't plan for this!<eos> You have annoyed me for the last time.<eos> Yup.<eos> No!<eos> Faster!<eos> Cramp.<eos> Cramp.<eos> It's him!<eos> Look at that!<eos> Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
Hey. It's good to see you guys.<eos> Come on.<eos> Sir.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> I think these belong to you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Crimson, Woody, Ash.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Is he talking to us?<eos> You learned your lessons well.
Crimson, Woody, Ash.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Is he talking to us?<eos> You learned your lessons well.<eos> Come on, bring it in.<eos> No. I'm not really the affectionate type.<eos> Okay. Does it feel like this is crossing the line to anyone else?<eos> - Yup.<eos> - Nope.<eos> You're my prize pupils.

Anger-y<eos> Mighty, Mighty Red You<eos> Rescued me<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How did you guys find the time to pull this off?<eos> This is why we went to go get pedicures, isn't it?<eos> Nope.<eos> We got pedicures because we're worth it.<eos> - I got gels.<eos> - You guys are something else.
Look at the harness.<eos> Tanya! When did you come in?<eos> - Happy birthday.<eos> You can meet Andrei.<eos> - Happy birthday.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So how old are you today?<eos> Eighteen, but my father still thinks I'm a little girl.<eos> - Girls.<eos> - Hey, hello. You look amazing.
MC squared, shows that a very small amount of mass may be converted into a very large amount of energy.<eos> Quickly. Come on.<eos> Come on, quick as you can.<eos> Where's your mother?<eos> That's it, get up there.<eos> There's no new Cold War.<eos> You have welcomed us with open arms...<eos> And you will find us committed partners.<eos> Family secure.<eos> What the fuck do you want, you shit ants?
Stop!<eos> I don't understand!<eos> Do you understand now?<eos> That's a Jericho 941 pointed at my head.<eos> You can get one on the black market for $300.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It is a very reliable weapon.<eos> My name is David Packouz.<eos> And I'm an international arms dealer.<eos> What do you know about war?

Options?<eos> What kind of options?<eos> Well, are you familiar with the Corvus TP19?<eos> That's Brazilian and it's shit.<eos> Contract says Berettas, I want Berettas.<eos> Sir, I need you to work with us a little on this.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> I'm in the ass crack of the world, defending your freedom.<eos> And I got to work with you shit bags?<eos> Look, I don't know if those Berettas are really in Amman or if you're just trying to goose your profits like every other piece of shit in your miserable, rat-fuck profession.

Okay, bye.<eos> - Sorry, kind of an emergency.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Don't worry, I have to go first.<eos> I'm American.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The American Embassy offered little to no help in dealing with the Ministry of Customs.<eos> So we took matters into our own hands.<eos> He says your permit has expired and that you can't fly your crates out of Jordan without one.
Right now?<eos> We're coming down.<eos> That was Aladdin.<eos> They're in the lobby.<eos> See that?<eos> Come on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> What's the problem?<eos> You wanted your guns back, he got you your guns back.
Helmut fucking Newton over here.<eos> All right, man.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> Let's go get fucking paid.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Crazy, right?<eos> $12.2 billion.<eos> It's all seized from the godfather himself.<eos> You guys call Saddam Hussein the godfather?
- Wait, what?<eos> Okay, how much for the AK ammo?<eos> - 10 cents a round.<eos> - That's fucking amazing.<eos> And what about shipping?<eos> You can get Ilyushin 76 through Russian pilots. 80K per flight.<eos> I'm sorry, you're on a terrorist watch list?<eos> Do you work for Homeland Security?<eos> Relax, bro.<eos> You two should probably talk this over.
We use church, hospital, school.<eos> Albania is most armed country in the world.<eos> Hey, that's cool.<eos> Congrats, bro.<eos> It was like a fucking museum in there.<eos> Most of this shit hadn't seen daylight since the Cold War.<eos> But that didn't matter to us.<eos> All we cared about was the AK ammo.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We have plenty of what you came for.
Man, eight fucking weeks in Albania.<eos> Iz is going to hate me forever.<eos> No, she's going to suck your cock every day for a year.<eos> Because we're on the verge of making $30 million.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> Go crush it.<eos> Thanks, bro.<eos> Nice.<eos> Hey, you've reached Iz.<eos> You know what to do.
There's Chinese writing on every fucking crate.<eos> Trust me, it's Chinese.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Henry, what the fuck!<eos> We've been trying to reach you for two days!<eos> It's Efraim and David.<eos> We have a serious fucking problem.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> The AK ammunition, it's Chinese.<eos> What, you think the Afghans who are getting shot up by the Taliban give a shit where their ammo comes from?
We have a serious fucking problem.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> The AK ammunition, it's Chinese.<eos> What, you think the Afghans who are getting shot up by the Taliban give a shit where their ammo comes from?<eos> No, but the Pentagon does.<eos> Henry, you know we can't use Chinese!<eos> America has an embargo against China.<eos> You had your boys show us the one crate of Albanian ammo in the entire country.<eos> I'm sorry, did anyone prevent you from inspecting the other crates?<eos> Did you even bother to ask what the country of origin was?
You had your boys show us the one crate of Albanian ammo in the entire country.<eos> I'm sorry, did anyone prevent you from inspecting the other crates?<eos> Did you even bother to ask what the country of origin was?<eos> Who the fuck would ask that?<eos> Henry, I'm staring at 100 million rounds of illegal Chinese ammunition that you sold us.<eos> What are we supposed to do?<eos> Do your fucking job!<eos> The U.S. government wants to look the other way. Don't give them a reason not to.<eos> And while you're at it, learn the difference between.<eos> "We have a problem" and "You have a problem."
Whoa. What the fuck?<eos> Hey.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop!<eos> I don't understand!<eos> Do you understand now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you really think you could cut me out of my own deal?
Now's not a good time.<eos> I have not been paid yet.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Like for the month?<eos> Ever.<eos> You haven't been paid anything?<eos> Your partner doesn't return phone calls.<eos> My guys need to be paid.<eos> They are going to stop work.<eos> David, I know the real reason that you want ammunition repacked.
The least we can do, pray for the Captain, Chief Collagen, the rest of them men, all good men.<eos> Hey, ain't we good men, Quirey?<eos> Don't get me wrong, praying's great, but it ain't everything.<eos> We need to actually do something.<eos> A word.<eos> That hothead Brown, he wants to launch the lifeboats.<eos> - The lifeboats?<eos> - Quirey, he wants to do nothin'.<eos> And between them, the two of them are getting the men worked up.<eos> I figure that you know the boat better than anybody, you're practically married to it, so...
Just break apart, dump us all out in the sea.<eos> It's our only choice, we're gonna find a soft shoal and we'll lay 'er up, slow the water that's comin' in, stay in the same spot, we'll blow the whistle,<eos> we'll give whoever's comin' to look for us a chance to find us.<eos> We're gonna steer a ship without hydraulics?<eos> That's your plan?<eos> How's that gonna work?<eos> I'll build a manual tiller.<eos> Hey, Sybert, why should we even listen to you?<eos> The only thing you ever cared about was this ship, ya know, I'll tell you what...<eos> You two make a cute couple at the bottom from the ocean.
That boat is too small for these seas.<eos> And this ship will be sunk by nightfall.<eos> Now, every fella here wants to live, the only way that happens... is if we run her aground.<eos> Set up a watch and look out for a shoal.<eos> I need four men working the pulleys on the emergency tiller.<eos> I need four men manning the pumps, aft of steering.<eos> And the rest of you on the fuckin' line topside, Down below!<eos> Communicate with the engine room!<eos> And somebody... keep blowin' that whistle.<eos> You heard him, boys, now move it, c'mon.
Well, okay then...<eos> How 'bout we go back to the Station, see if we can get to the bottom of it?<eos> Just got off the phone with Boston.<eos> They diverted a plane from the Mercer, and it sighted the stern of the tanker Pendleton 5 miles east of here.<eos> My God, two tankers broken in half in one day, that's gotta be some kind of record.<eos> Boston and Nantucket have dispatched all their boats to the Mercer.<eos> They can't make it here in this weather.<eos> Webber, pick yourself a crew, take that 36-500 out and you go over the bar, and you find the stern of the Pendleton, ya hear?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Do you fellas wanna get warmed up, get some coffee?
- You feel that?<eos> She's drifting.<eos> - Must've lost the tiller.<eos> We gotta slow her headway or we're gonna miss the shoal for good.<eos> Close the governor valve, cut the propulsion, we gotta isolate the boiler.<eos> We gotta conserve everything she's got left.<eos> I keep tellin' ya...<eos> this boat's just bad luck.<eos> It's got nothing... to do... with luck.<eos> Station Chatham, this is the CG-36-500, do you copy?
- You're the girl with the bear-coat, right?<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> You gonna tell me what's it's like out there?<eos> Shoals on that bar are never in the same place twice.<eos> Flood currents carry them big ocean swells that rise up when they hit, the shallows crash up against that bar.<eos> The outgoing tide crashes up against that bar.<eos> That man shouldn't'a sent them out to cross that bar in a storm like this.<eos> Maybe they CAN turn back, maybe they get lost BEFORE.<eos> Can't get out.<eos> You know Bernie, right?
Hey... hey boys, we won't be able to see much, all right?<eos> So I have to listen to those waves hitting' that bar... gotta time it.<eos> So I'm gonna wait for a low and then we go.<eos> We got faith in you, Skip.<eos> Anytime you're ready, you just go, Bernie, all right?<eos> The compass is gone.<eos> Fitzy, the engine died.<eos> - I got it, I got it.<eos> - Nah, you don't.<eos> You got about five seconds, boys.
Yeah, as long as we got a generator that's keepin' the pumps goin'.<eos> By whoever might be comin' to find us, we'll buy a little time.<eos> You wanted be to be the man, Sybert, now you the man, right?<eos> Except you got no wife, you got no kids back home.<eos> You're a single man... always hidin' down below, what do you gotta lose?<eos> All right, that's enough, Brown.<eos> I'm scared to, Brown.<eos> I gotta a life the same as you.<eos> Just don't see the point in sitting' around talkin' about it.<eos> Station Chatham, 36-500, Station Chatham, 36-500, do you copy?
Does no good listening' to all that chatter, Miriam... better learning' live not knowin'.<eos> - How long you been married to Bernie for?<eos> - We're... We're not married yet.<eos> - I didn't know if I...<eos> - Like I said, Bernie, he's a good man.<eos> Him and some of them others try gettin' out a year ago, save my husband Arnie and the crew of the Landry.<eos> They're out fishin' marlin near Nantucket Sound when the boat started takin' on water, night just like this.<eos> Come on, we gotta get goin'.<eos> Brother's on his way to come meet us.<eos> I gotta get down to the lodge, come on, you two.
We're with you, Skipper.<eos> - Keep the lights on, like SHE'S doin'!<eos> - Quick! Turn your lights on!<eos> Turn on the lights, everyone.<eos> More light, so that they can see us.<eos> I think we made it over the bar.<eos> That high tide carried us over!<eos> You see that?<eos> Fitz, turn on the searchlight.<eos> - Look, you see that?
Najid, cut the horses loose!<eos> We have to turn back.<eos> We have been riding for six months.<eos> - And we've lost twenty men.<eos> - But we survived.<eos> Yes. By chance.<eos> Any one of us could have met that same fate.<eos> We were the strongest.<eos> Remember why you're here.
They know what it is.<eos> And they don't look so happy to see it.<eos> All the more reason to get the hell out of here.<eos> Our weapons are on that table.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> I can take the guards on the perimeter with my bow.<eos> You cut the legs out from under the officers.<eos> I must confess this is not my favorite plan.<eos> Where was this found?<eos> You speak English.
- Well... - I killed it.<eos> - Alone?<eos> - He claims to have killed it alone.<eos> - By himself?<eos> Impossible.<eos> Tell me how.<eos> A swing of the sword.<eos> The hand came away clean.<eos> The beast fell back into a chasm.<eos> - Why are you here?
Impossible.<eos> Tell me how.<eos> A swing of the sword.<eos> The hand came away clean.<eos> The beast fell back into a chasm.<eos> - Why are you here?<eos> - We came to trade.<eos> We were ambushed.<eos> Guards!<eos> You are soldiers.
We should kill them!<eos> General.<eos> Until we find the truth, - I advise we keep them alive.<eos> - Alert!<eos> General, signals from the smoke towers!<eos> We are under attack!<eos> Take them to the stockade.<eos> - All stations on full alert! - Yes!<eos> All stations on full alert!<eos> Are you killing us, Sister?
All stations on full alert!<eos> Are you killing us, Sister?<eos> Two lost travelers?<eos> What's happening here?<eos> Is this bitch going to kill us?<eos> I think she'd like that.<eos> If it is death, my dear, we need time to pray.<eos> I'm trying here.<eos> Sister, I know a siege when I see one.<eos> What comes at you so hard you need a wall like this?

We are under siege.
- Tao Tei.<eos> You killed a Tao Tei scout.<eos> You killed it alone.<eos> You are correct. We are under siege.<eos> But we did not expect the attack for another nine days.<eos> Attack?<eos> - Tao Tei?<eos> - What the hell is a Tao Tei?<eos> Many things about your story have importance.<eos> You are not to die today.
- You've earned General Shao's praise.<eos> - Will they come back?<eos> - Yes.<eos> All we can do is prepare.<eos> Take them to the barracks.<eos> - They need rest.<eos> - Yes!<eos> Thank you for saving my life.<eos> Commander Lin.<eos> You grew up in the Nameless Order.

I've taught you many things, and you have been learning,<eos> but they have been learning also.<eos> Strategist Wang warned they are evolving.<eos> No one listened.<eos> The enemies we're facing today are more intelligent than 60 years ago.<eos> Watch the foreigners closely.<eos> They can never leave.<eos> - We must protect the secrets of the Wall.<eos> - Yes sir!<eos> Who are you?

This is Tovar.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - We came looking for black powder.<eos> - I bet you did.<eos> I came with mercenaries for the same thing, 25 years ago.<eos> And did you find it?<eos> Finding it and leaving with it alive are two different things.<eos> You saved the west turret. That was extremely diplomatic.<eos> We weren't being diplomatic. We were trying to stay alive.<eos> - You smell like animals.
Tell him there's no better weapon here.<eos> He claims his weapon is second to none.<eos> Let him show us.<eos> Give him some space!<eos> - They wish to see you shoot.<eos> - In here?<eos> Unless he's afraid.<eos> It's a large audience.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - He thinks you have fear.
- Sir Ballard.<eos> English and Latin.<eos> Heard he's been here for twenty five years. You won't let him leave.<eos> He must stay here.<eos> What about us?<eos> Pace yourself.<eos> The meals are regular here.<eos> I hope not to stay that long.<eos> I like your thinking, but I suggest you keep your plans private.<eos> You aren't the first Westerners to come here looking for black powder.

Bring your partner.<eos> - How long have you been here?
- As a soldier?<eos> - Worse.<eos> As a gleaner.<eos> Packs of children, we'd clean the battlefields.<eos> After, when the fighting's over, I became a page.<eos> - a pikeman's boy.<eos> - For your country? No.<eos> I fought for food.<eos> You fight to eat. You live long enough, you fight for money.<eos> How many flags do you fight for?
I have something to show you.<eos> He should be careful with her.<eos> She's very powerful here.<eos> Then it is a fair contest.<eos> Come.<eos> You wish to try?<eos> Men are too heavy. Do you think we can pull him up?<eos> She says men have so much to teach us.<eos> I don't think that's what she said.<eos> You know what I think?

Xin ren means trust. To have faith.<eos> Here, in this army, we fight for more than food or money.<eos> We give our lives to something more.<eos> Xin ren is our flag.<eos> Trust in each other.<eos> In all ways, at all times.<eos> Well, that's all well and good, but I'm not jumping.<eos> I'm alive today because I trust no one.<eos> A man must learn to trust, before he can be trusted.<eos> Then you were right.
We're not the same.<eos> Stay vigilant!<eos> The next attack is coming!<eos> My god!<eos> A taste, a glimpse, a few pilfered grains from Strategist Wang's supply of black powder.<eos> He's mastered the transmutation of these elements.<eos> People speak of a weapon.<eos> There are many weapons here.<eos> Why have we not seen them?<eos> There are many things you have not seen.
There are many weapons here.<eos> Why have we not seen them?<eos> There are many things you have not seen.<eos> And many things you should pray will not be needed before the siege is through.<eos> The Tao Tei will return.<eos> When the drums call to battle, the guards leave their post and take their positions on the Wall.<eos> That is our moment.<eos> We want to be riding away as the battle rages.<eos> And the armory doors?<eos> - You have keys?
Without instruction, they fall still.<eos> - How to prove that?<eos> - How can we be sure?<eos> Why not try it?<eos> Capture a Tao Tei. See if it works.<eos> - He wants to try. He wants to catch one.<eos> - How?<eos> No net is strong enough.<eos> Hunt them. Like a whale.<eos> You know what that is.
- What the hell are you doing?<eos> - She's listening.<eos> - Prepare black powder weapon!<eos> - Prepare black powder weapon!<eos> Prepare to light the fuses!<eos> - Did it work?<eos> - Yes. The beast was captured.<eos> - My friend...<eos> - He was unharmed.<eos> Why did you go over the Wall?
- Yes. The beast was captured.<eos> - My friend...<eos> - He was unharmed.<eos> Why did you go over the Wall?<eos> Xin ren.<eos> Did I say that right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Black powder.<eos> It is a terrible weapon.<eos> It would be better if you had never seen it.
Did I say that right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Black powder.<eos> It is a terrible weapon.<eos> It would be better if you had never seen it.<eos> I know very little of the outside world.<eos> But it seems to me, the greed of men is not that different from the Tao Tei.<eos> Is that true?<eos> The strong take what they want.<eos> Forget what you have seen.
But it seems to me, the greed of men is not that different from the Tao Tei.<eos> Is that true?<eos> The strong take what they want.<eos> Forget what you have seen.<eos> Excellent!<eos> Send it to the capital immediately. No!<eos> We need to study it here.<eos> If a Tao Tei is captured alive, it must be sent to the emperor.<eos> This is an imperial order.<eos> You're much braver than they think.
- The wind is strong now.<eos> It blows from the north all day tomorrow.<eos> We have to use the balloons.<eos> - If it works, how long to Bianliang?<eos> - Six hours if the wind hold.<eos> If we make it alive.<eos> General, none of the tests have worked.<eos> Get ready!<eos> Come on!<eos> - How did you capture it?
Come on!<eos> - How did you capture it?<eos> - Your Excellency!<eos> Your Excellency, It's the magnet.<eos> It keeps the beast under control.<eos> This is the most important discovery in the history of the Tao Tei.<eos> - We will investigate immediately.<eos> - Bring him here!<eos> - I tried to stop...<eos> - You dare to speak to me?

No!<eos> Bastard!<eos> - Keep it steady!<eos> - Yes, General!<eos> - Watch the powder!<eos> What happened?<eos> What happened?<eos> We have failed.<eos> The Tao Tei are in the kingdom.<eos> You are free to leave.

Take what you wish and go.<eos> - This was the General's final order.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> To do what?<eos> To fight?<eos> - Is there a chance?<eos> - There's only one.<eos> Kill the Queen.<eos> Kill the Queen, or we all die.<eos> Leave. Tell the world what you have seen, and tell them what is coming.
There's the queen!<eos> They will not attack while the queen is feeding.<eos> We have a chance!<eos> Hold on!<eos> State your purpose!<eos> General Lin Mae from Nameless Order. At your service!<eos> What took you so long?<eos> The Tao Tei overrun the city!<eos> Thousands of soldiers and innocent are dead.<eos> You're too late!
- We need it to kill the queen.<eos> Once she is dead, The Tao Tei cannot function.<eos> Without her signal, their whole army will freeze.<eos> There is an underground canal here.<eos> Has it been breached?<eos> The Tao Tei should all be above ground.<eos> And the one we captured?<eos> We load it up. We feed him.<eos> And it will return to its queen. Good.<eos> You'll have one hell of a scar, - but you'll live.

Crazy for crying... Staying in synch-void could be dangerous.<eos> Soon they will march on Granada.<eos> Sultan Muhammad is weak.<eos> He'll surrender the Apple and betray the Creed to save the prince.<eos> The love makes us weak.<eos> Gladly I'll sacrifice my flesh and blood, for survival of the Creed.<eos> When I die today, don't waste your tears for me.<eos> The Lord spoke. And he said:<eos> "If a man abide not in me he is cast into the fire and he is burned!"<eos> For decades, you have lived in the world torn apart by religious discord.
"Guy's like Pope.<eos> No sleep, 48 hours, boom."<eos> "No stop to piss. Always on time."<eos> Guy's psychopath. Like driving Terminator.<eos> Top of truck, mounted camera.<eos> GPS device.<eos> So, I need someone like you, Burt Reynolds, a nobody, but smart.<eos> And you, Grease Lightning, a nobody, but crazy.<eos> You figure out a way to steal truck. Burt Reynolds, you bring it to me.<eos> Then you make your money. 250,000 each.
I want you to know right now, sir, that I do not for one moment condemn you for what you've done, not at all.<eos> 'Cause our line of work is quite brutal and quite ruthless, isn't it? Yeah.<eos> I mean, you and I would never have set ourselves up to present our résumés, would we?<eos> No.<eos> Welcome to the big, fat, stupid, meaningless world in which we all live, move, and have our being where no one gives a shit anyway, because that's the way it is, bro.<eos> Always has been, always will be.<eos> World without end. Amen.<eos> Hallelujah!<eos> Brave new world!<eos> Yeah, you people.

No sudden moves.<eos> I'm sorry, yeah.<eos> The drugs are strong today!<eos> Jesus.<eos> Talaz!<eos> - Geran?<eos> Geran?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - That's not her. - What?<eos> You got the wrong woman!
Don't talk like that.<eos> A thousand dollars here and now if you give me a kiss!<eos> Rance, you make me laugh...<eos> Come on, stop it!<eos> You can't stay here alone!<eos> I'll many you.<eos> And what'll your wife say?<eos> Say the word and she'll never see me again.<eos> Rance, that's enough!<eos> You're insulting me!

They loved each other so much!<eos> Oh, I too would like to find a man... that I could truly love.<eos> Maybe you've already found your gemstone!<eos> Who's going to curl my hair for me?<eos> Welcome, stranger!<eos> I'm the man who asked for whisky and water.<eos> Really?<eos> Nick, the gentleman takes his whisky the way he likes it.<eos> Sit down.<eos> You must be tired.
Welcome, stranger!<eos> I'm the man who asked for whisky and water.<eos> Really?<eos> Nick, the gentleman takes his whisky the way he likes it.<eos> Sit down.<eos> You must be tired.<eos> - Are you the girl of the camp?<eos> - Yes.<eos> No strangers allowed in the camp.<eos> Guess you took the wrong trail.

Want a game, eh?<eos> What's your name?<eos> Since when have we asked people's names here?<eos> - Johnson.<eos> - Johnson... Is that all?<eos> I come from Sacramento.<eos> Welcome among us, Johnson from Sacramento.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Yes, if you remember me too...
- Johnson... Is that all?<eos> I come from Sacramento.<eos> Welcome among us, Johnson from Sacramento.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Yes, if you remember me too...<eos> How could I not?<eos> It was on the trail to Monterey.<eos> It was on the way back.<eos> You gave me a sprig of jasmine...
Yes, if you remember me too...<eos> How could I not?<eos> It was on the trail to Monterey.<eos> It was on the way back.<eos> You gave me a sprig of jasmine...<eos> And then I said:<eos> "Let's go and pick blackberries".<eos> - But I didn't go...<eos> - That's right.<eos> - You remember, then?

I went on my way.<eos> You said...<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Sure you do:<eos> I said that from then on...<eos> - You'd never forget me.<eos> - And I've never forgotten you, never!<eos> I've longed to see you ever since!<eos> But I never did!<eos> Mister Johnson, you've riled me!
Before the whole camp, I'll vouch for Johnson!<eos> Evenin', Mr. Johnson!<eos> Good evening, boys!<eos> I'm glad about that!<eos> That skunk'll stop being so bossy now!<eos> - Mr. Johnson, how about a waltz?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - May I have the pleasure?<eos> - Me? Do excuse me...<eos> You won't believe it, but I've never danced in my life.
Tie him up!<eos> (The boss's saddle!<eos> They've caught him! )<eos> Give me a drink!<eos> I'm dead tired.<eos> You son-of-a-bitch, let's see your filthy face!<eos> You're one of Ramerrez's gang!<eos> I Ian away.<eos> I hated him.<eos> If you want, I'll put you on his trail.
I Ian away.<eos> I hated him.<eos> If you want, I'll put you on his trail.<eos> - This dirty skunk is lying!<eos> - No, no, I'm not!<eos> - Do you know his hideout?<eos> - It's just over a mile from here, up the Madrona Canyada.<eos> I'll show you the way.<eos> I swear by my mother, Maria Saltaja, I'm not lying!<eos> If you like, I'll take you there.
(He's not been caught!<eos> He's in there dancing! )<eos> - Where're we going?<eos> - After Ramerrez!<eos> - What about the gold?<eos> - Minnie's sharp eyes will guard our pile!<eos> A brandy!<eos> I let them capture me to throw them off the scent.<eos> Our men are following me in the trees.<eos> Soon you'll hear a whistle;
A brandy!<eos> I let them capture me to throw them off the scent.<eos> Our men are following me in the trees.<eos> Soon you'll hear a whistle;<eos> If we're to do the job, whistle back.<eos> - This man knows where Ramerrez is...<eos> - Untie him!<eos> Now, let's go!<eos> Good luck!<eos> Mr. Johnson, have you stayed behind to keep me company and guard the saloon?
Finding you here where anyone can come in and drink... or steal...<eos> How strange to find you here.<eos> I give you my word that I could tackle any man...<eos> Even if he only wanted to steal a kiss?<eos> Even then!<eos> That's happened to me more than once...<eos> But my first kiss...<eos> I still have to give my first kiss.<eos> Really?<eos> Do you live here at the "Polka"?

Listen!<eos> What can that whistle mean?<eos> In that barrel, Johnson, there's a fortune.<eos> The boys cache their gold there.<eos> And they leave you all alone like this?<eos> Every night, they take it in tums to stay here and guard it.<eos> Tonight they've gone off after that damned bandit!<eos> Oh, if someone wants that gold, He'll have to kill me first!<eos> Minnie!<eos> Can you run such a risk for something that's not yours?

alongside a ditch or by a river, They lie down and never stand up again.<eos> Poor fellows!<eos> So many of them have left a family back home, a wife, children... and they've come here to die like dogs in the mud to send a little gold<eos> That's why, Johnson, whoever wants this gold, Takes it over my dead body!<eos> Oh, never fear,<eos> Nobody will dare!<eos> I sure do like when you talk that way!<eos> But I must be on my way...<eos> I would have liked to bid you a last goodbye at your cabin...<eos> Must you really go?
Oh, never fear,<eos> Nobody will dare!<eos> I sure do like when you talk that way!<eos> But I must be on my way...<eos> I would have liked to bid you a last goodbye at your cabin...<eos> Must you really go?<eos> What a PW!<eos> The boys will be back soon.<eos> When they come, I'll go home.<eos> If you want to come and say goodbye, we can go on talking sitting by the fire...
If I'd studied more,<eos> No telling what I might've been.<eos> Just think of that.<eos> What we both might've been!<eos> I realise that now, Minnie, when I look at you!<eos> Do you mean it?<eos> But what's the use?<eos> Ignorant and no good for anything...<eos> No, Minnie, don't<eos> You don't know your true worth.

I'm going to wear my Sunday best, the whole lot from top to toe.<eos> I'm not so bad-looking...<eos> A drop of scent, too... See?<eos> And gloves... It's more than a year since I wore them!<eos> But maybe I'll look too smart... eh?<eos> Hullo!<eos> Wowkle, he's here already!<eos> - Hullo!<eos> - Good evening!<eos> - Are you going out?
Hullo!<eos> Wowkle, he's here already!<eos> - Hullo!<eos> - Good evening!<eos> - Are you going out?<eos> - Yes...<eos> No...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Come in.<eos> How pretty you are!
No...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Come in.<eos> How pretty you are!<eos> Ugh!<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I didn't notice...<eos> That's enough, mister:<eos> don't make excuses.<eos> You looked so lovely...

You didn't come to the "Polka" tonight on account of me...<eos> What brought you then?<eos> Perhaps you did mistake the trail<eos> to Micheltorena's?<eos> Wowkle, bring the coffee!<eos> What a pretty little room!<eos> Do you like it?<eos> It's all full of you...<eos> How strange your life must be, high up on this mountain, alone and so far from the world!<eos> Oh, if only you knew what a happy life it is!
What about when the blizzards rage?<eos> Then I'm busy.<eos> The Academy is open.<eos> The Academy?<eos> It's the miners' school.<eos> And who's the teacher?<eos> I am.<eos> - Something sweet?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Do you like reading?
And who's the teacher?<eos> I am.<eos> - Something sweet?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Do you like reading?<eos> - Very much.<eos> I'll send you some books.<eos> Oh, thank you very much!<eos> Love stories?<eos> If you want.
- Very much.<eos> I'll send you some books.<eos> Oh, thank you very much!<eos> Love stories?<eos> If you want.<eos> Do you like them?<eos> Yes, ever so much!<eos> To me, love is something that lasts forever!<eos> I shall never understand how, if you love somebody, you can only desire her for an hour.<eos> I think you're wrong.

Have one of our Havanas?<eos> Bring the candle!<eos> Oh, my roses!<eos> You'll squash them!<eos> Why not take them off?<eos> A kiss... Give me a kiss, just one!<eos> Mr. Johnson, give a man an inch... and he'll take a yard!<eos> Your lips refuse, but your heart consents!<eos> Wowkle, go home!<eos> You can stay for an hour... or two...
- You're safe!<eos> I'm shaking all over!<eos> - We spent a terrible quarter of an hour!<eos> - Why?<eos> - They were afraid for you...<eos> - For me?<eos> - Your friend Johnson...<eos> - The stranger...<eos> - Your beau at the dance was Ramerrez!<eos> What are you saying?
- Your friend Johnson...<eos> - The stranger...<eos> - Your beau at the dance was Ramerrez!<eos> What are you saying?<eos> We said that your perfect Johnson from Sacramento is a highway bandit.<eos> Oh, it's not true!<eos> I know it's not true!<eos> Watch you're not so trusting next time!<eos> It's not true! No!<eos> You're lying!
- Oh, nothing, nothing...<eos> Nice company he keeps! Nina!<eos> Let it be a lesson to you!<eos> Now, boys, it's late...<eos> Goodnight.<eos> We'll let you get to sleep.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I feel at ease now.<eos> Let's be off.<eos> If you want... I'll stay.
I accepted it.<eos> That was my destiny!<eos> But one day I met you...<eos> I dreamt of going far away with you, far, far away,<eos> and putting everything right through a life of love and honest work.<eos> And my lips murmured a fervent prayer:<eos> "Oh, God, may she never learn of my shame!"<eos> The dream was all in vain!<eos> Now, I've finished.<eos> That you're a bandit, may God forgive you.

I've followed his trail.<eos> He has to be here.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Oh! I'm sick of you and your Ramerrez!<eos> He's there!<eos> No, he's not...<eos> But I hit him, by God, I'm sure of it!<eos> He can't have gotten away, he must be here.<eos> Search for him, then!<eos> Rummage about wherever you like, then get out from under my feet for once and for all!

- He's there! Up there!<eos> - Oh no...<eos> I won't let you!<eos> - Let me go! Let me go!<eos> - No!<eos> I won't let you! No!<eos> Mr. Johnson, come down!<eos> Wait, wait...<eos> He can't!<eos> You can see he can't!
Mr. Johnson, come down!<eos> Wait, wait...<eos> He can't!<eos> You can see he can't!<eos> Come down or by God...<eos> Just a minute, Rance, just one minute!<eos> A minute?<eos> Why?<eos> Ha, ha, ha! What a change!<eos> Do you still want to play a game with me, Mr. Sacramento?
Come down or by God...<eos> Just a minute, Rance, just one minute!<eos> A minute?<eos> Why?<eos> Ha, ha, ha! What a change!<eos> Do you still want to play a game with me, Mr. Sacramento?<eos> Take your pick: rope or revolver!<eos> That's enough, you devil!<eos> Look at him: he's fainted.<eos> He can't hear you any more...

and settle the matter!<eos> What are you, Jack Rance?<eos> A gambler.<eos> And Johnson?<eos> A bandit.<eos> Me?<eos> The owner of a drinking and gambling den; I live off whisky and gold.<eos> Birds of a feather!<eos> All bandits and cheats!<eos> Tonight you asked for a reply to your passion...

I've got the fidgets...<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's terrible to think a man's life depends on a game of cards.<eos> Ready?<eos> I'm ready. You cut for deal.<eos> Two hands out of three.<eos> - How many?<eos> - Two.<eos> Why do you love him so much?<eos> What do you see in me?
See, I win!<eos> Quick, Jack, for pity's sake!<eos> Get me something... I feel ill!<eos> - What can I get you? - Over there!<eos> Ah, the bottle...<eos> But where's a glass?<eos> Hurry, Jack, I beg you, for pity's sake!<eos> I know why you fainted:<eos> you've lost the game!<eos> You're wrong.
to before that God-damned critter Johnson got in our way!<eos> Cursed dog!<eos> He seemed done for...<eos> And to think, all this time, while we've been freezing in the snow,<eos> he's been in there, warmed by Minnie's breath, caressed, kissed...<eos> Oh, Rance!<eos> A thief like that!<eos> I could've shouted out what I knew for everyone to hear...<eos> But you didn't do it.<eos> You sure behaved like a real gent.
Hurrah!<eos> Sheriff, did you hear that?<eos> I was sure of it!<eos> They've found the bandit!<eos> A great day for Wells Fargo!<eos> - Hi there!<eos> - Hi there!<eos> Do you hear?<eos> Ah, this time you won't escape me, you rogue!<eos> You're luckier than me!
Goodbye!<eos> I'm coming with you!<eos> Hooray!<eos> Hooray!<eos> This way!<eos> It's your turn to weep now, Minnie!<eos> Only for you, I've endured sleepless nights, weeping. And you laughed at my misery!<eos> Now, those tears of mine will turn to laughter!<eos> Minnie, now it's you who'll weep, you who laughed at me!<eos> - The man that you loved won't come back!
Now, those tears of mine will turn to laughter!<eos> Minnie, now it's you who'll weep, you who laughed at me!<eos> - The man that you loved won't come back!<eos> - Say!<eos> - He's surrounded!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - The rope is ready to hang him! - Soon be over!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Hooray!<eos> Sheriff, did you hear?
- Lynch the Spaniard! Kill him!<eos> - Billy is a crack hand!<eos> - And you shall be king of the forest!<eos> We'll make you dance your last quadrille...<eos> We'll make you pay for Minnie's caresses...<eos> Kill him!<eos> Don't fret, caballero!<eos> It's nothing at all...<eos> Spare me your sneers...<eos> I don't worry about dying, and well you all know it!

Leave her alone!<eos> None of you ever said: "That's enough!"<eos> when I gave you the best years of my youth, when, lost amid curses and brawls,<eos> I shared your troubles and your hardships!<eos> Nobody said "That's enough", then!<eos> Now this man is mine, as he is God's.<eos> God in Heaven had blessed him!<eos> He intended to seek new horizons far away!<eos> The bandit that was, died up there in my cabin.<eos> You can't kill him!
Start walking upright?<eos> Good times.<eos> You think you can hide from us?<eos> Why did I have asparagus?<eos> Wait, I have money.<eos> I can pay now.<eos> Dima wants a word with you.<eos> So we take you back to Russia.<eos> Can't we just talk via Skype?<eos> You ladies didn't forget anything in the room, did you?
Thank you.<eos> I think he wants us to have a drink with him.<eos> No, we got to go.<eos> Bennie, we can't be rude.<eos> One drink.<eos> - One?<eos> - One.<eos> All right, guys... who knows some good Mongolian drinking games?<eos> Drink up, drink up!<eos> How do you do that?
Always running away.<eos> I mean it looks pretty tiring... fighting as hard as you do.<eos> Impressed?<eos> No.<eos> I'm actually kinda pissed.<eos> Don't point that thing at me, man.<eos> Hurry up, hurry up!<eos> Which part of the pig am I blowing on?<eos> Is that what we're trying to make?<eos> The cops ask any questions... you just look at them like you don't understand a word, okay?
You're the Matador?<eos> He looks like the kid from Jerry Maguire.<eos> Thank you, Connor, for sticking with me.<eos> You're welcome, partner.<eos> Guns in the water.<eos> Now.<eos> Dasha!<eos> It's about time.<eos> Sorry we're late.<eos> Well, just glad you could make it.
Best partner I ever had.<eos> Ahem.<eos> Best Chinese partner.<eos> Taking off for Russia tonight. Really?<eos> Why?<eos> A wise man once told me that honor... is the most important thing in life.<eos> I made a promise and I intend to keep it.<eos> Sorry, Connor.<eos> Dos vedanya.<eos> Where are you taking me?

Sorry, Connor.<eos> Dos vedanya.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> You'll never get away with this.<eos> Will you pipe down? You're ruining the surprise.<eos> Was he always this grumpy?<eos> Keep the blindfold on.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay. Surprise!<eos> You took me to my own farm?
Bells will ring at the New York Stock Exchange for another day, on this March 18th.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> Are you listening?

Bells will ring at the New York Stock Exchange for another day, on this March 18th.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> Are you listening?<eos> Are you paying attention out there?<eos> Good.<eos> Because it's about to get complicated, so I'm gonna start out slow and make it nice and simple for you.<eos> You don't have a clue where your money is.

- It has gone haywire. - An algorithm...<eos> -...glitch...<eos> -...a glitch...<eos> -...glitch!<eos> - A glitch.<eos> Okay, so Ibis took a beating yesterday, but if you've been paying attention to me for the past 16 months, Walt Camby has made you a lot of money.<eos> But if you were late to the party, I'm not going to sugarcoat it, you got your ass smacked yesterday.<eos> But this is only the first round.<eos> Because this, my friend, is an opportunity.<eos> So here's what you're gonna do.
It's a measly 30 companies.<eos> So why do you people keep paying attention to it?<eos> Probably because our network insists on tracking it.<eos> - Right here at the bottom of the screen...<eos> - Not sticking to the script.<eos> ...in large font all day.<eos> - Why does he keep talking?<eos> - And why do they do that?<eos> Sacajawea, Lee.<eos> Because you people keep paying so much attention to it.
Even the Teamsters get excited about these numbers.<eos> Somebody didn't tell me something.<eos> Looks like a delivery guy.<eos> Say it.<eos> I'm not gonna move until you say it.<eos> - Balls. - Balls!<eos> There it is!<eos> Just under the wire.<eos> All right.<eos> Now, for the rest of you, you know what that means.
- Three!<eos> - What do you want me to do?<eos> Are we live?<eos> Yeah, we're live.<eos> All right, turn the cameras off again I'm gonna shoot him in his head. You hear me?<eos> Everybody understands.<eos> - Don't try any tricks with the monitors.<eos> I got the whole broadcast here on my phone.<eos> If I see anything other than us, I'm gonna shoot him in his head, all right?<eos> - Do you understand me?
All right.<eos> I want everyone to know something.<eos> I might be the one with the gun here, but I'm not the real criminal.<eos> It's people like these guys!<eos> They're stealing everything from us and they're getting away with it, too.<eos> Nobody's asking how.<eos> Nobody's asking why.<eos> I didn't steal anything from you.<eos> Be quiet, Lee.<eos> You got to open your eyes out there.
That's what you said.<eos> I did recommend it, but I never said it was safer than a savings account.<eos> You want to bet? Come on, let's bet.<eos> You said it was safer than my savings account.<eos> - I would never say it.<eos> - Come on. Let's bet.<eos> March the 6th, it was Stock Pick of the Millennium.<eos> I make a stock pick every single day.<eos> That's a fucking joke.<eos> You got the tapes back there, right?
Well, now they can.<eos> - Logo's ready.<eos> - Put it up on the big screen.<eos> All right, Lee.<eos> Go to work.<eos> Watch what we can do.<eos> I want to talk to everybody out there.<eos> Every single person that's watching me right now.<eos> And here's what I want you to do.<eos> I want you to go to your computer and I want you to buy Ibis stock.
All right, Lee.<eos> Go to work.<eos> Watch what we can do.<eos> I want to talk to everybody out there.<eos> Every single person that's watching me right now.<eos> And here's what I want you to do.<eos> I want you to go to your computer and I want you to buy Ibis stock.<eos> I'm gonna be upfront with you.<eos> I don't want you to do it because you're gonna make money.<eos> I want you to do it because it'll save my life.
We take care of each other.<eos> It's embedded in our DNA.<eos> Not because an equation tells us to, but because we feel it in here.<eos> And right now, I need your help.<eos> This looks promising. We can do the right thing.<eos> But we have to do it together.<eos> Come on. Refresh, refresh.<eos> So, I'm talking to every one of you.<eos> Every single person that's watching me right now.<eos> I want you to dig as deep as you can and I want you to ask yourself, what is a life worth to you?
You want your brains splattered all over downtown, Lee, huh?<eos> Mr. Budwell!<eos> Mr. Budwell.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Mr. Budwell, please stand by.<eos> Stand by for what?<eos> Stand by for what?<eos> Hi, Molly. I'm Marcus Powell.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You think I don't know what you're doing?
Mr. Budwell, please stand by.<eos> Stand by for what?<eos> Stand by for what?<eos> Hi, Molly. I'm Marcus Powell.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You think I don't know what you're doing?<eos> I know what you're doing!<eos> Lee, we're gonna put his girlfriend onscreen so you can talk to her.<eos> It's all a big stall. And you're gonna keep your mouth shut until then.<eos> You hear me? Sitting up there, trying to figure out how to keep me from pulling this fucking trigger.
She stayed here longer than she should have. I know that.<eos> The truth is I don't know what I'd do without her at this point.<eos> But if she was standing right here, right now, I couldn't admit that.<eos> But luckily it's just you in front of me, Lenny.<eos> You and your... Your warm eyes and your gentle soul.<eos> All right, get the fuck out of here.<eos> - I got a signal.<eos> - Okay, are we live?<eos> Time to find Diane Lester.<eos> Let's go. - If you're still with us, here we go.
How far away are you?<eos> I'm on... Where am I? I'm on Vesey Street.<eos> Bring me what you have, Ron. I'll meet you at the corner of Pearl and Pine.<eos> Start running.<eos> I'll see you in three minutes.<eos> What, three minutes?<eos> That's a half-mile away!<eos> I can't run a half-mile in three...<eos> Hello?<eos> What are you folks doing?
I know how they walk. I know how they lay an egg.<eos> There is nothing about a chicken that I do not know!<eos> - (CHICKEN CLUCKS) - Ta-da!<eos> I call them chicken wings! (CLUCKS)<eos> Chickens don't fly!<eos> But they have wings.<eos> They must fly. You fly, don't you?<eos> Fly! - (CHICKEN SQUAWKS) - Uh-oh!<eos> I'm going to... Grrr!<eos> Come here, you rascals!
Silence, mam'selle!<eos> First position!<eos> - Second! - What? - Third!<eos> Huh? Oh!<eos> Today is an important day.<eos> I've gathered all the coryphées together to audition for the part of Clara in 'The Nutcracker', which will debut on Christmas Eve and star Rosita Mauri.<eos> Rosita?<eos> Rosita Mauri? - Oh, I don't believe it! - Ahem!<eos> So every girl in this room has a chance to dance in my new ballet, except you.<eos> You've all worked hard, except you!
"Why do you dance?"<eos> I've answered it!<eos> Oh!<eos> By the way, that crazy jumpy thing is called le grand jeté, and you're not ready.<eos> Are you doing dance or kung-fu?<eos> (LAUGHS) You are SO funny.<eos> This is Victor.<eos> We escaped from the orphanage together.<eos> Hello! I am loving your apron.<eos> (GROANS) It seems that you are going out tonight.
- You're so sad.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> (SPEAKS RUSSIAN)<eos> I could knock you out with one flick of my tiny finger, but that would make my finger dirty and smelly.<eos> So, I'm dirty, but at least I don't spend my day in tights!<eos> I can't believe this!<eos> She is MY muse.<eos> Yeah, well, she is my whatever-you-just-said, too, with knobs on, asparagus!<eos> - Stop!<eos> You're both idiots!
You are nothing.<eos> You will always be nothing!<eos> Only one way to find out.<eos> Right here, right now.<eos> ♪ Now I'm letting go I make my own choice... ♪ - Oh, my God!<eos> - (STUDENTS CHEER)<eos> (WHISPERS) You can do it!<eos> Impressive, ladies.<eos> But let me ask you both an important question.<eos> Why do you dance?
-On the side.<eos> -On the side.<eos> Go, Dragon Warrior!<eos> You can do it!<eos> Go, Dragon Warrior!<eos> Defend the Valley!<eos> Dragon Warrior!<eos> Go, Dragon Warrior!<eos> Defend the Valley!<eos> You guys aren't doing the Dramatic Pose, are you?
I mean, yeah.<eos> I am.<eos> Before the battle of the fist comes the battle of the mind.<eos> Hence, the Dramatic Entrance.<eos> Nice Dramatic Entrance.<eos> What's the occasion?<eos> Today will be my final class.<eos> Your final...?<eos> Wait.<eos> I didn't even know you were sick!
I am.<eos> Before the battle of the fist comes the battle of the mind.<eos> Hence, the Dramatic Entrance.<eos> Nice Dramatic Entrance.<eos> What's the occasion?<eos> Today will be my final class.<eos> Your final...?<eos> Wait.<eos> I didn't even know you were sick!<eos> Although you have been looking a little...
My fault.<eos> Crane, go high.<eos> I mean low!<eos> Low!<eos> Ah, my claw thingy!<eos> Viper and Tigress, do, like, a Totem Pole Poison Technique!<eos> You two, do a Swarming Insect Bite... with a Yellow Tail, Yellow Jacket, Spicy Tuna...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Good job, Po.<eos> Did you at least learn a little something?
Yeah, that was a complete disaster.<eos> I'm glad we're not Po right now.<eos> What a loser!<eos> What was Shifu thinking?<eos> What was Oogway thinking?<eos> I think he heard us.<eos> I didn't hear anything.<eos> He said you're a loser.<eos> I'm sorry, Oogway.<eos> Would you stop doing that?
How was your first day teaching?<eos> Humiliating.<eos> I heard.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Did Tigress tell you?<eos> I heard from Monkey, and Crane, and Mantis... and your dad, and Mrs. Chow from the gift shop... and those ducks you just passed... and Tigress told me.<eos> Did she also tell you that it'll never happen again? Because I'm done.<eos> Teaching or being humiliated?<eos> Both!<eos> I don't know why you ever thought I could teach that class.
Eventually.<eos> After you master teaching.<eos> Teaching?<eos> There's no way I'm ever gonna be like you.<eos> I'm not trying to turn you into me.<eos> I'm trying to turn you into you.<eos> Turn me into me?<eos> Wait a second, that makes no...<eos> Almost there, Shifu.<eos> Just a little more confusing and you'll be the next Oogway.
Turn me into me?<eos> Wait a second, that makes no...<eos> Almost there, Shifu.<eos> Just a little more confusing and you'll be the next Oogway.<eos> Sorry, no offense, Master Oogway.<eos> I just...<eos> I'll let you get back to your eternal peace.<eos> What is this place?<eos> My brother's farm?<eos> If I stepped on you, would you die?
Who's gonna get you?<eos> Master Rhino.<eos> What?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Hello.<eos> Guys, guys.<eos> You're never gonna guess who just showed up. Not in a million years.<eos> You just try.<eos> Your father!<eos> How did you just guess that?
Maybe it'd be scary back at them.<eos> Okay, but we gotta plan what we're gonna say first.<eos> Otherwise, it won't be scary. It'll just be stupid.<eos> It's not them talking, you idiots!<eos> It's me talking through them.<eos> Kai!<eos> Who?<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Enough.<eos> -Did you see that?
Wait, wait, hold on.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> It is written in Oogway's hand.<eos> "Long ago, I had a brother..."<eos> Oogway had a brother?<eos> "in arms. In arms." Sorry.<eos> He says, "Brother-in-arms."<eos> Maybe you should just unroll it all at once?
Pandas who used the power of chi to heal me.<eos> They taught me how to give chi.<eos> But Kai wanted the power all to himself.<eos> He saw that what could be given could also be taken.<eos> I had to stop him.<eos> Our battle shook the earth... until, finally...<eos> I banished Kai to the Spirit Realm.<eos> Should he ever return to the mortal realm... he can only be stopped by a true master of chi.<eos> "True master of chi"?<eos> Like you!
Fine, a third opinion.<eos> Monkey?<eos> Viper?<eos> Tigress?<eos> Dad, you heard what Shifu said Oogway said.<eos> This guy can only be stopped by a master of chi.<eos> And I can only master chi by knowing who I really am.<eos> Well, I'm a panda.<eos> I'll pack you a lunch for the road.<eos> Do you really think Po can master chi in time?
Sure looks like a long ways up there.<eos> And my son hates stairs.<eos> So, let's go home.<eos> We're pandas.<eos> We don't do stairs.<eos> I've waited my whole life to hear those words.<eos> Rats.<eos> Whoa...<eos> This is the secret panda village?<eos> No wonder you keep it a secret.
That's why I brought her.<eos> Take good care of her.<eos> Yes!<eos> Stripy Baby.<eos> You look just like me, but a baby.<eos> You're like me, but old.<eos> You're like me, but fatter!<eos> You're like me, but... with a hat.<eos> He does wear a hat!<eos> You all look like me.
Wings of Surveillance!<eos> -Why do you do that?<eos> -Do what?<eos> Just because you say "Wings of" before something... it doesn't mean that you're doing a special move.<eos> It's like me saying "Antenna of Power" or "Thorax of Making Sandwiches."<eos> Wings of Disagreement.<eos> Whoa!<eos> There.<eos> Master Bear, Master Chicken, Master Croc!<eos> What are you doing out here?
You gotta let the hill tell you where to roll.<eos> Rookie mistake.<eos> Dim, Sum, let's show him how we go uphill!<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Snack time.<eos> Po!<eos> You can fly?<eos> I'm coming in hot!<eos> Get them while they're cold.<eos> What are you doing there?
My noodles!<eos> Leave my noodles alone.<eos> Subtle, Po.<eos> Very subtle.<eos> Let me get some of that.<eos> Hey, leave my hat alone!<eos> We love noodles!<eos> More noodles!<eos> Just like my Po.<eos> What are you guys looking at?
You're right.<eos> There's no way I can stop him and his army.<eos> Unless you had an army of your own.<eos> You?<eos> Not just me.<eos> Us.<eos> All of us.<eos> I finally found my son, after all these years.<eos> It's going to take a lot more than the end of the world... to keep us apart.<eos> But you don't even know kung fu.
-"We can do this"?<eos> -No!<eos> -"We can learn kung fu"?<eos> -After that!<eos> "We can be just like you"?<eos> -Yes!<eos> -We can?<eos> No!<eos> You can't!<eos> But you don't have to be!
I have to turn you into you!<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> I know!<eos> Thanks, Dads.<eos> -You're welcome?<eos> -You're welcome?<eos> I'm gonna do something I never thought I'd be able to do.<eos> I'm gonna teach kung fu.<eos> You guys, your real strength comes from being the best "you" you can be.<eos> So who are you?
That doesn't make any sense.<eos> I know!<eos> Thanks, Dads.<eos> -You're welcome?<eos> -You're welcome?<eos> I'm gonna do something I never thought I'd be able to do.<eos> I'm gonna teach kung fu.<eos> You guys, your real strength comes from being the best "you" you can be.<eos> So who are you?<eos> What are you good at?
-Chitty-chitty chat-chat.<eos> -In...<eos> -Chat, chat, chat.<eos> -In the...<eos> -Chit-chat!<eos> You pudgy little...<eos> Round them all up.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It's true.<eos> You guys have all been turned green!
Sweet!<eos> Stripy Baby!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> -Do it.<eos> -You're mean!<eos> Fire!<eos> Fire in the hole!<eos> Yes!<eos> All right, kids!<eos> You got it, guys!
No.<eos> He's not here?<eos> Po?<eos> Po?<eos> Why isn't he back?<eos> Dragon Warrior.<eos> Oogway?<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Whoa!<eos> You are extra shiny.
As are you.<eos> I know, right?<eos> It's like the best cape ever.<eos> When I run with it, then it looks really cool.<eos> It suits you.<eos> You've grown.<eos> Yep.<eos> I gotta lay off the panda buffet.<eos> Grown up... as I hoped you would when I sent the message to your father.<eos> You sent the universe mail.
Yep.<eos> I gotta lay off the panda buffet.<eos> Grown up... as I hoped you would when I sent the message to your father.<eos> You sent the universe mail.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Yes.<eos> Because the universe needed you.<eos> Me?<eos> You finally became the panda you were always meant to be.<eos> But, how'd you know I could?
And the past.<eos> I saw the panda who could unite them both.<eos> That is why I chose you, Po.<eos> Both sides of a Yin and Yang.<eos> And my true successor.<eos> Me?<eos> I can't take that.<eos> Just take it.<eos> I have a bigger one.<eos> I mean, you're enlightened and everything.
Po!<eos> You can fly!<eos> Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> Dads!<eos> -Son!<eos> -Son!<eos> Don't you go disappearing in petals ever again.<eos> We thought we lost you.<eos> No, you saved me.

Let's try it again.<eos> ♪ We see the undertow and we say... ♪ There's the undertow!<eos> ♪ There's the undertow There is the undertow<eos> ♪ Hey, you found the undertow And we see the undertow ♪<eos> - Did I forget again?<eos> No. - No, sweetie.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> - No biggie, kelpcake.<eos> What if I forget you?<eos> Would you ever forget me?

I'm Dory.<eos> Can you please help me?<eos> Hi, Dory.<eos> Are you lost?<eos> - Yeah, where are your parents?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> - Well we'll look around.<eos> Are any of these fish your parents?<eos> Hi, I'm Dory.<eos> Can you please help me?
Oh, sweetie, do you want to come swim with us?<eos> That is the nicest offer I've gotten all day.<eos> I think. Uh, I can't remember.<eos> Anyhoo, thanks, but I'm looking for someone.<eos> Oh. Can't remember. Can't remember.<eos> Hi!<eos> I'm Dory.<eos> Was it something I said?<eos> Kidding.<eos> Okay, you're not coming back.
Of course, I don't really remember yesterday all that well.<eos> Anyway, I would say the scariest moment of the trip was the 4 sharks.<eos> Wait, I thought there were 3 sharks.<eos> No. No, there were definitely four.<eos> But last time you told it, there were three.<eos> Son, which one of us travelled across the entire ocean?<eos> Nemo did.<eos> Obviously we had to cross the ocean... to find him, so you know... He went first.<eos> I guess that's true. Isn't it?<eos> Well, you made it!
I feel a migration song coming on.<eos> Oh... ♪ Migration, migration let's learn about migration<eos> ♪ It's nature's inspiration to move around the sea<eos> ♪ Here's a scientific promise That a fish who's Oceanodromous<eos> ♪ Where did everyone go?<eos> I'm by myself Oh there they are.<eos> I'm back<eos> ♪ Plus or minus 4 degrees based on solar positioning ♪<eos> Oh, kids stay away from the edge.<eos> Okay, you hear that?
- Now, I need everyone to listen to me.<eos> - All right, listen up!<eos> - When the rays pass through here-- - The rays, gonna pass through. What do we have to be careful of?<eos> Everybody has to be careful of what?<eos> - The undertow!<eos> - That's right.<eos> That's right. The under-<eos> - The undertow?<eos> Because the current created by all the flapping is very strong.<eos> And if you're not careful, you can get pulled into--
Ugh, I don't remember.<eos> It was something-<eos> - It was--<eos> Oh, oh, oh! It was something about the--<eos> The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.<eos> My family!<eos> I remember my family!<eos> They're out there somewhere.<eos> I have to find them.<eos> Guys! Where are you?

Well, I don't know, but there's only one way to find out. Mom! Dad!<eos> - Yell louder, Dory. - Mom! Dad!<eos> - Sh! - What was that?<eos> Wait.<eos> I've heard that before.<eos> I remember someone saying, "Sh."<eos> Yes, well done.<eos> That was me. One minute ago.<eos> Please.<eos> Have you seen my mommy and daddy?
All right, I don't want to hear the whole story again.<eos> I was just asking about the one part because, look, if I said that--<eos> I'm not positive I did.<eos> It's actually a compliment because...<eos> I asked her to wait and I said, "It's what you do best."<eos> So I-<eos> - Oh, it's my fault!<eos> It's all my fault she got kidnapped and taken into whatever this place is.<eos> What if it's a restaurant?<eos> Oy! You two!

Off! - Get off!<eos> Off! Don't you worry about a thing.<eos> That place is the Marine Life Institute.<eos> The Jewel of Morro Bay, California.<eos> She was right.<eos> It looks like Dory can do something besides forget.<eos> Thank you, Nemo.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> So how are we gonna get inside?<eos> Wait. You want to get inside MLI?
- No.<eos> Stop.<eos> - Seriously.<eos> - We've got to get in that bucket. - I'm not going with you in that bucket.<eos> - Here... I...go...in...the...bucket.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, guys, I'm looking for my family.<eos> Oh, good idea. Play dead.<eos> I'm sorry. I got to blink.<eos> How do you hold your eyes open that long?
I'm pretty sure it's the building over there.<eos> That's ill-defined and roundish. Like Bailey's head.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - Always another way. There's--<eos> There!<eos> Guys, follow me.<eos> I know how we can get to locomotion.<eos> - Open Ocean.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> You know I can't swim over there, right?
- Wait, what?<eos> - Always another way. There's--<eos> There!<eos> Guys, follow me.<eos> I know how we can get to locomotion.<eos> - Open Ocean.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> You know I can't swim over there, right?<eos> I don't see how this is going to get us inside.<eos> What are you even doing?
I don't see how this is going to get us inside.<eos> What are you even doing?<eos> We're calling her over, of course.<eos> Calling her over?<eos> Calling who over?<eos> Lads, meet Becky.<eos> Flying?<eos> No, no, no new information.<eos> Listen, tell her thank you.<eos> You guys have gone above and beyond. Really.
I know you're scared, but you can't give up.<eos> Follow me.<eos> ♪ My mom wrote this song for me<eos> ♪ It's gonna get us out of here ♪<eos> Sing with me, Hank.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm coming, Mommy.<eos> I'm coming, Daddy!<eos> - Stop! - Huh? - Turn back.<eos> You're headed right for Poker's Cove.
- Yeah!<eos> What would Dory do now?<eos> Who's Dory?<eos> Oh boy. Are we happy to see you.<eos> Happy to see me?<eos> I'm happy to see you!<eos> I haven't had anyone to talk to in years.<eos> Years?<eos> Wow. Unfortunately we can't stay long. We have to go because--<eos> Now why would you want to go?

Three heartbeats.<eos> I'll have a hard time forgetting you though.<eos> My parents are actually down there.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Yeah, I think you are.<eos> Where are they? Where are they?<eos> Have you seen a mom and a dad without me?<eos> Have you seen a couple? They're old like you.<eos> Not old like you, but older than you even.

You can just go through the pipes, honey.<eos> Oh I can't do that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I'll forget where I'm going.<eos> And I can't be somewhere where I have nobody to help me.<eos> - Well, then I guess you're stuck here.<eos> - You're not helping, Bill.<eos> Just go in there if you want to.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> Could you tell me how to get there?
No! Dory, turn around!<eos> That's great, Dory!<eos> You're headed right toward us!<eos> What? You want me to go right?<eos> No! No!<eos> Not right. Oh, I can't look!<eos> It's consuming her!<eos> It's eating her alive!<eos> - You're okay!<eos> - You found me! How did you find me?
- You found your parents?<eos> Well, not exactly.<eos> No.<eos> I mean not yet, but, um, I know where they are.<eos> I don't know exactly how to get there, but I know that-<eos> - I'm getting help--<eos> - Down to quarantine.<eos> - Quarantine.<eos> That's it! Oh, and I met this septopus, super cranky... but secretly kind of sweet, and he got me into the exhibit...<eos> Do you think my parents will want to see me?
Whoo-hoo! Almost home.<eos> I'm almost home. I think I'm getting the hang of this!<eos> I hear footsteps.<eos> - Hank!<eos> - Quiet.<eos> Hank, we need to get in that tank.<eos> That rhymed.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Her parents are there!<eos> Look, you've got three minutes to get everyone in this cup with you... and then I'm on that truck to Cleveland, got it?
And I'd forgotten you and I'm so sorry.<eos> Dory. Don't you dare be sorry.<eos> Look what you did.<eos> - What?<eos> - You found us!<eos> That's right. You found us.<eos> Honey, why do you think we stayed put here all these years?<eos> Because we believed one day you'd find us again.<eos> Exactly!<eos> But I thought you were gone.
- What? - All right. Let's get going.<eos> No! And then the whale swallowed us even though I speak whale.<eos> A whale?<eos> Good thing I wasn't there to see that.<eos> Actually Marlin never believes I even know how to speak whale... but you know what, he always kind of trusts me anyway.<eos> You know, I like this Marlin already.<eos> Yeah. And then somehow we found Nemo.<eos> Or did he find me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But, you know what, Nemo is the sweetest.
Stop traffic.<eos> Stop traffic! Everyone needs to stop.<eos> People stop to look at things. Things that they like. Things that are cute.<eos> Things that are cute!<eos> Okay, I got it.<eos> - What?<eos> What is it? - Quickly before I forget.<eos> Destiny, when the truck reaches the bridge you flip me up there.<eos> Got it.<eos> You guys, follow me.
I don't know in what way, but I think this has something to do with--<eos> Water. I need water.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> How'd you get here?<eos> - Oh! - I thought we'd never see you again.<eos> - Aw, me too.<eos> But, darn it, no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't forget you.<eos> I guess I missed the rest of my family too much, huh?<eos> - We're family?<eos> Do you know what that feels like?
Becky, come back.<eos> Dory, follow me.<eos> No, no, wait.<eos> We don't have Dory!<eos> No, no, Becky wait!<eos> Stop it.<eos> We need to go back.<eos> - Please don't eat us!<eos> - Where's Dory?<eos> - Who are you?
We need to go back.<eos> - Please don't eat us!<eos> - Where's Dory?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Jenny?<eos> - Marlin?<eos> - Charlie?<eos> Nemo?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Thank you for taking care of Dory.
What form it will take, we do not know.<eos> If they are successful, there will be no more Waves.<eos> No more conflicts.<eos> Humanity as we know it will be wiped from the face of the Earth.<eos> Now. I'm gonna tell you some things I know.<eos> This is our world.<eos> It is our home.<eos> They will not overrun it.<eos> They will not possess it.<eos> So with whatever time we have left, you will learn to think, speak, move and fight like the soldiers you are.
I'm scared.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Just go to sleep, all right?<eos> What was your name before?<eos> Ben.<eos> What was yours?<eos> Sam.<eos> But my sister called me Sams.<eos> When I couldn't sleep she would sing to me.<eos> Could you guys please shut up?
We can't stay here.<eos> They'll be back.<eos> That alleyway.<eos> We'll have cover there.<eos> No, it's too far.<eos> If we're out in the open that long they'll pick us off one by one.<eos> We need a distraction. - Okay.<eos> - Okay what?<eos> I'll distract them.<eos> When I tell you to run, run as fast as you can.
I'd hug you if I didn't think you'd punch me in the nuts for it.<eos> Okay, so what do we do now?<eos> None of this makes sense.<eos> They knock planes out of the sky and cause earthquakes, but they're afraid of an army of children?<eos> There's something Vosch isn't telling us.<eos> Okay, I'm not risking my life for this.<eos> Ringer, what are you doing?<eos> I'm unenlisting.<eos> I'm better out there on my own.<eos> If you know what's best for you, you'll do the same.
What's up, man?<eos> - Oh, my God! What's going on, man?<eos> - Come on, man. Hey.<eos> Put your guns down. Put your guns down.<eos> Don't shoot. Calm down.<eos> She's not an Other. Neither am I.<eos> - I'm glowing green, right? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, listen.<eos> You know me.
Put the guns down.<eos> Just put 'em down!<eos> I'm not an Other.<eos> I don't even think any of those people out there shooting at us are Others.<eos> Reznik, Vosch... They lied to us.<eos> They lied to us, man.<eos> Green doesn't mean alien. Green means human.<eos> Just, without one of these.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Don't you guys see?
I left him back at the base.<eos> - I was trying to protect him.<eos> - Jeez.<eos> - I gotta go back.<eos> - That's suicide, dude.<eos> I gotta go back.<eos> - You can't just wander back in there. - They'll know.<eos> - I can't leave him there!<eos> I'll put the tracker back in. They'll pick me up.<eos> You guys go ahead. I will meet up with you later.
Why?<eos> What's the point of any of this?<eos> - What did we do to deserve...<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Other than occupy a space we need.<eos> We're not that different, Ben.<eos> Your kind would do exactly the same thing.<eos> No.<eos> Our kind wouldn't have wiped out an entire species.<eos> Of course you would.
Stay with your group leader.<eos> Proceed to the transport vehicles.<eos> Come on.<eos> Move along, people.<eos> Straight ahead.<eos> - Stay with your group leader.<eos> - Keep it moving.<eos> - Don't fall behind, everyone.<eos> - Where do they think they're going?<eos> Once you are on the plane, you will receive further instructions.
Here, wake up, buddy.<eos> Hey, there he is.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, lazy bones.<eos> Put your bear down, would you?<eos> The Others see our hope as a weakness, as a delusion.<eos> But they're wrong.<eos> It's our hope that lets us survive.<eos> That lets us bend, but remain unbroken.<eos> - You two knew each other?
She brought me here the other day.<eos> She is a nasty witch.<eos> When we are alone, She cries continually.<eos> Now ... in the home it is good.<eos> Sometimes I dream that I am great And still live with my mother.<eos> She still leads self-talks And drink beer.<eos> And I also drink a lot.<eos> Fortunately, That this will never happen.<eos> If I had not come here, I would never have known you.<eos> Where have you been?
I will report!<eos> She's coming<eos> The judge will tell me right.<eos> That was not a good idea.<eos> I get hallucinations.<eos> The french fries talk to me.<eos> And what does it say to you?<eos> It says, "Eat me, eat me, Fettack!"<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Do not you eat?
- Soon.<eos> How soon?<eos> You know, I have spoken to the judge.<eos> I would like to Your host family.<eos> For you and Camille.<eos> - Does that mean we're your guests?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And you will be like our family, Even though you are alone?<eos> I agree.<eos> You go to my house.

Camille and Courgette are leaving.<eos> And the bull also!<eos> Hey, Simon!<eos> Simon...<eos> We're not leaving, Simon.<eos> We want to stay here.<eos> It would be unjust when we leave.<eos> It's nice here, all together.<eos> Simon...<eos> You must go away.
Hey, Simon!<eos> Simon...<eos> We're not leaving, Simon.<eos> We want to stay here.<eos> It would be unjust when we leave.<eos> It's nice here, all together.<eos> Simon...<eos> You must go away.<eos> It's totally rare that someone So great children like us adopted.<eos> You must go away for us.
I swore if I made it home, I would never follow orders again.<eos> I left a soldier. I came home an outlaw.<eos> I lived one robbery to the next.<eos> A good day was filled by sleep, and a good night spent running too hard to look back.<eos> I lived that life for 10 years until it caught up to me.<eos> It all started with an inside man.<eos> The Albert White crew was playing a high stakes poker game, and our inside man left the back door open for us.<eos> Three, two, one.<eos> Give us the fucking money.<eos> - Do you know whose fucking place this is?

Because I belong to the Greater Tampa Rotary Club myself, and I don't recall ever seeing you.<eos> I come here to do a piece of business with you, and you wanna play fucking games?<eos> - Is that what I wanna do?<eos> - Look, you're the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan around here.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> But do you think that we got where we are by letting some inbred shit pickers muscle us?<eos> If that's who you think we are, you're making a fatal miscalculation, son.<eos> 'Cause we're clerks, and bankers, and police officers, and deputies, and...<eos> Hell, we even got a judge.<eos> And if you're dim enough to fight us, we're gonna rain bloody hellfire down on you
You boxed out Albert.<eos> Put him in a little piss corner of Miami.<eos> I've been through the books.<eos> You made us a force down here.<eos> But now what?<eos> "No Irish need apply?" What can I be?<eos> What I fucking tell you to be.<eos> Before you get a fucking pop in the mouth, Mick.<eos> You can be consigliere.<eos> You teach Digger the ropes. Meet people.
Seppe, give it another look.<eos> Boss, they spotted Coughlin downstairs.<eos> He even get a scratch?<eos> A cut on the head.<eos> I don't suppose you can wait for him to die of blood poisoning?<eos> Well, I don't think we got that kinda time.<eos> It's a hard thing for a man to have a son this stupid.<eos> MAN :<eos> All clear, boss.<eos> I want you to cover the door and the stairs like Roman fucking centurions.
- Dana!<eos> - Now who's being rude?<eos> It's not polite to interrupt someone when they're talking, David.<eos> In answer to your question, Jules,<eos> I would say this move has been a lot like a death.<eos> A lot.<eos> Which reminds me.<eos> Excuse me for one moment.<eos> - Uh, maybe we should go.<eos> - DANA: Stay right where you are, Jules.
- This is fantasy, Briar.<eos> It is impossible to walk out with that money.<eos> The eyes of the fucking city are on that bank.<eos> And I order you to come in now and hand over...<eos> Briar.<eos> Briar!<eos> I'll be on the comms.<eos> Listen in. - And stay here till it's over.<eos> - You're ditching us?<eos> - You won't be any use to me.
What does the Mirror show you?<eos> What do you see?
What does the Mirror show you?<eos> What do you see?<eos> An oft told tale.<eos> That of Snow White, how she vanquished the evil Queen Ravenna<eos> and took her rightful place on the throne.<eos> But there is another story, one you have not yet seen.
Kill them all!<eos> For if she could not raise a child, then in its place she would raise an army.<eos> Come on, boy!<eos> Eric!<eos> Run!<eos> Come on.<eos> Freya turned the once-green farmlands of the north into a frozen wasteland.<eos> There she built her fortress, and ruled as the Ice Queen.<eos> Wagons!<eos> How lucky you are.

It is a trick played by the cruel on the foolish and the weak.<eos> Cast it from your mind.<eos> Never let it render you frail of mind or of will, because in my kingdom, there is but one law.<eos> Do not love.<eos> It's a sin, and I'll not forgive it.<eos> Now, let's hear no more of family and love.<eos> Those illusions are beneath you.<eos> I have freed you from them.<eos> And in exchange for this precious gift, I ask only one thing, your loyalty.<eos> You will train.

Which?<eos> The best ones.<eos> Eric and Sara, my queen.<eos> Did I scare you?<eos> Do you not know?<eos> I never miss.<eos> Wagons!<eos> The new children, sir.<eos> It's about time.<eos> You're home, kids. Come on, hurry up.
But either way, we shall be free.<eos> You do love me, don't you?<eos> Aye, I do.<eos> I give you my life and my death.<eos> Stand or fall, I'll never leave your side, I swear it to you.<eos> Yes, I know this story.<eos> The girl goes in secret to meet her one true love.<eos> I wonder how it ends this time.<eos> I gave you both everything.<eos> And in return you betray me.
I gave you both everything.<eos> And in return you betray me.<eos> For love.<eos> We fought your wars.<eos> We've done enough.<eos> Please, my queen, let us go.<eos> Do not beg me!<eos> It is weak.<eos> You are weak.<eos> Do you want to leave?
What was that thing?<eos> Move all your forces to the northern border.<eos> Why?<eos> What do you know?<eos> Freya, Queen of the North.<eos> That owl was her spy.<eos> Now she knows about the Mirror.<eos> And if she finds it, everything we hold dear will be covered in ice.<eos> Move your men to the north.<eos> What are you two still doing here?

What are you two still doing here?<eos> We're your partners.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I am Snow White's man as well.<eos> I mean, dwarf.<eos> If she's in trouble, I wanna help!<eos> My queen, Vardhelm has fallen.<eos> It was the last stronghold.<eos> The entire White Lands are yours.<eos> You've won.
Uh, generally by accident.<eos> Too little light.<eos> Too much of this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on. Keep up.<eos> Chilly with that door open.<eos> Pass me the...<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, some of the...<eos> You three look like you're far from home.
That's all right.<eos> No. No, I'm not having it.<eos> Aye.<eos> You ought to hold your tongue, mate, before you lose it.<eos> ls that so?<eos> You know, if it was just me, I wouldn't be worried.<eos> If it was me and him, I'd be a tiny bit worried, because he's a bit of a waster.<eos> Not true.<eos> But none of that matters, because we're with him.<eos> And he will gut you like a deer quicker than you can blink.
Just tell us what you want.<eos> Personally, I'd like you to take your shirt off and prance around for me.<eos> But seeing as you're so modest, I'll settle for every penny you've got.<eos> Aye, so it's money you're after.<eos> MY apologies.<eos> All I have is this.<eos> You know what this is?<eos> It's a great big bloody diamond.<eos> I'm not blind.<eos> Where'd you get that?
Truce.<eos> Your diamond...<eos> You got it from a golden spear, right?<eos> Aye, I did.<eos> Goblins.<eos> Goblins?<eos> Goblins?<eos> That old fishwives' tale.<eos> You expect us to believe that?<eos> I expect you to stand there and look ugly and stupid, and say nothing else.
Where can we find them?<eos> Not far.<eos> There's a hidden forest just up the Dorian River on the northwest side of the Sanctuary.<eos> They say they keep all their treasure there in that wood.<eos> Gold, silver, jewels, as far as the eye can see.<eos> If your mirror is shiny, it'll be in there somewhere.<eos> Can we access the Sanctuary from there?<eos> Dunno.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Will you show us the way?

Well, you see, that's where the proposition comes in.<eos> You see, no one's ever come out of them woods alive.<eos> But you two big ones, you look like Huntsmen.

Chicken.<eos> I know why you're not talking.<eos> Do you?<eos> Aye.<eos> You noticed the sparks between me and Mrs. Bromwyn.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> She's my type.<eos> Loud and angry?<eos> Well, it's what I'm used it, isn't it?<eos> I'm awfully sure you'll have a good life together.
Eric.<eos> My heart is yours, it always has been.<eos> But if this is a game... End it now.<eos> Have you been true?<eos> Huntsman, what is this?<eos> Stand tall, brother.<eos> Eric.<eos> My Eric.<eos> Your queen has missed you.<eos> You're not my queen, Freya.
You as well.<eos> Go on.<eos> Shut it.<eos> Stop sniveling.<eos> Twerp.<eos> Keep walking.<eos> Just keep walking.<eos> It's not my sister's fault, my lord.<eos> She was hit in the face as a baby with a rock.<eos> You two, come with me.
You don't remember me, do you?<eos> No.<eos> This is my war face.<eos> Pippa.<eos> I know why you're here.<eos> Aim true.<eos> My children.<eos> This is the day for which...<eos> For which you were born.<eos> You will face an army of men who have never lost a war, men who have...
Who have forgotten what it means to be afraid.<eos> We will bring fear once again to Snow White's army.<eos> And their lands will be mine.<eos> And their children...<eos> Their children...<eos> For I am queen.<eos> lam queen.<eos> This is what I trained you for.<eos> This is why I raised you.<eos> This is why I made you what you are.
It is.<eos> Do you not have laws?<eos> I do.<eos> Then what is your judgment?<eos> Death.<eos> Traitors!<eos> Traitors to who?<eos> Your old queen?<eos> Your new queen?<eos> You broke the law.
I do.<eos> Then what is your judgment?<eos> Death.<eos> Traitors!<eos> Traitors to who?<eos> Your old queen?<eos> Your new queen?<eos> You broke the law.<eos> The law?<eos> Have you forgotten the ones who loved you?
What law did they break?<eos> Love does not make you weak.<eos> It's all that ever gave me strength.<eos> Tull, have we not fought side by side?<eos> We were children!<eos> Brothers and sisters.<eos> Did we not love each other?<eos> Fight with me.<eos> If you die, you die for something that's yours.<eos> Why do you turn away, Freya?

What did you do?<eos> What did you do?<eos> I don't have to tell you anything.<eos> Oh, but you do.<eos> You see, you said it yourself, you're something between this world and the Mirror.<eos> I summoned you out.<eos> Now you are bound to me!<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Mirror, Mirror on the wall who is the fairest of them all?<eos> You are, my queen.

Did you not think I wanted a child?<eos> Did you not think I wanted love?<eos> But these things were not meant for me.<eos> I have a higher calling!<eos> Do you still believe that love conquers all?<eos> Maybe not all.<eos> Just you.<eos> Are you ready, Huntsman?<eos> Aye.<eos> How lucky you are.
I work in Human Resources or "HR," as some people call it.<eos> And I have this poster in my office that says,<eos> "Keep calm and go to your safe place."<eos> Well, when I get a little stressed out or my anxiety spikes, I close my eyes and picture my cul-de-sac, and my wonderful wife, Karen, and our two sons, Patrick and Mikey.<eos> Because that's the place where I know everything is always okay.<eos> No matter what.<eos> - Bye, Mikey, Patrick.<eos> Bye, you guys.<eos> - Bye, guys. You can text us the minute you get to camp.
How it makes me feel.<eos> It looks great! I'm sure he...<eos> I'm sure he's happy to know that.<eos> Tell him from me.<eos> Yeah, it's one of our things.<eos> Keeps the spark alive.<eos> Do you and Jeff have a thing?<eos> Yes, Jeff and I have a thing.<eos> We do it really fast in case the kids come running into our room.<eos> Sounds like you're very sexual people.
He did not have to go number two.<eos> And now I know what Natalie was doing at the café.<eos> It was a drop!<eos> A drop?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I can't believe she duped me into this lingerie.<eos> But she was in her underwear and I was in my underwear and...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> She was so persuasive.<eos> Wait. You were both in your underwear at the same time?
Oh, shit!<eos> It's the Joneses!<eos> Try not to shoot them.<eos> Let's run for Carl's house.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Get in the car!<eos> Now! Let us get on with our stupid little lives!<eos> Get in the car now and I will explain everything.<eos> Mostly. I'm tired of your silver-tongued lies, Jones!<eos> Do you wanna get killed out here?

Are you stealing secrets from MBI?<eos> We're not stealing secrets from you.<eos> - There they are.<eos> - I see them.<eos> We're spies.<eos> His seat belt is jammed! Pull over.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Jeff gets car sick in the back!<eos> - Quiet!<eos> You broke into our house.

It's gotta be six. Here we go, folks.<eos> - Scrambled whites with toast. - Thank you.<eos> - Three-egg omelet with potatoes.<eos> - Thank you! Eggs, potatoes, and bacon.<eos> And a side of bacon.<eos> - Yum, yum, yum, yum!<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> What?<eos> High speed car chases make me hungry, honey.<eos> Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, if that's who, you know, you really are. I have a couple of questions.

Can't say that, either.<eos> You just said we were entitled to the truth.<eos> Did say you were entitled to it. Doesn't mean we can give it to you.<eos> You know what, honey?<eos> It's probably classified. That's why they can't tell us.<eos> - Do you want any of this?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll have some potatoes.<eos> I'm glad everybody's just enjoying their meal while we're in the middle of a... Like, a thing!<eos> You guys are just eating like there's nothing going on.
You guys are just eating like there's nothing going on.<eos> I'm a little troubled by it!<eos> Honey!<eos> That is not okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll keep asking 'til I get something that's not classified.<eos> Is that fine with you?<eos> Question 17.<eos> After a shootout like that, who cleans up all the bullets?<eos> Okay, can you guys tell us anything at all?
But you have to fit in.<eos> I mean, it's called being undercover.<eos> I mean, you had no problem wearing a burqa in Kabul.<eos> But this is the suburbs!<eos> It's hard. Don't you get it?<eos> Women here are vicious.<eos> Can I say? You don't know the women here.<eos> There you go.<eos> We don't know anything.<eos> Why did you bug our house?

Maybe you should go with me to the fuse box.<eos> That way you're not alone.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> There we go. There it is. There it is.<eos> It was just the circuit breaker.<eos> - It's okay. - Good Lord!<eos> Don't scream.<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> What, you didn't kidnap our friends and tie them to chairs?
It's not what you think.<eos> What, you didn't kidnap our friends and tie them to chairs?<eos> It is what you think.<eos> But it's not for the reasons you think.<eos> Dan is the one selling secrets from MBI.<eos> What?<eos> - You're right.<eos> She's very good. - Told you.<eos> Dan, is that true?<eos> And how are you two alive?
You should know that by now.<eos> So?<eos> How could you not tell me you were feeling this way?<eos> To be honest, you are not exactly the easiest woman in the world - for a man to admit his fears to.<eos> - What? How can you say that to me?<eos> I'm compassionate and sensitive.<eos> You can say anything to me.<eos> Well, calling me a pussy in Hebrew is not helping things.<eos> Run.<eos> You dove headfirst through a plate glass window?
I mean... if kids have crooked teeth, we can't have crooked teeth in this society.<eos> This isn't Great Britain, you know?<eos> There's all sorts of things you have to keep up with and...<eos> New tires for the minivan, piano lessons, you know, and, because all that...<eos> Carl Pronger is dead!<eos> Hang on!<eos> Get a hold of yourself!<eos> I never wanted anyone to get hurt, Jeff, I swear.<eos> We were protecting you.<eos> The Scorpion doesn't even know who you are. Karen!
Honey, I can't hear anything.<eos> They're silent killers.<eos> That's how they got Bin Laden.<eos> - Let's just stay down, okay?<eos> Where's the backup?<eos> Those guys are with him.<eos> There's no backup, Jeff.<eos> They pulled out when you blew your cover.<eos> What do you mean there's no backup?<eos> You're what they call "collateral damage."
Just hear me out, all right?<eos> Look, the Gaffneys, they don't belong in our world.<eos> We don't.<eos> We really don't.<eos> Okay?<eos> They're too good for that.<eos> Why don't we let them go back to their world?<eos> And then you and I, we, can settle this here?<eos> Here in our world.<eos> You guys can go murder each other and stuff.
Where did you get the gun from? No.<eos> I don't think we're gonna keep any of that online.<eos> That would get a lot of hits. And I lined it up, and smashed.<eos> Because there's shooting...<eos> Probably wanna keep it a little on the down low. Yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah, no, no, of course. Yes. Yes.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> I'm so proud of you guys.<eos> - You guys wanna come inside?

Really.

Oh, my God!<eos> - Guys!<eos> - Natalie!<eos> Tim!<eos> You've gotta be kidding me!<eos> What?<eos> - Can I take this?<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> We are here because of you.<eos> You told us about this place and that's why we came!

You are here.<eos> In Marrakesh.<eos> - That's a good memory. Wow.<eos> - Amazing! - What?<eos> - That's amazing.<eos> - My God.<eos> - You have a baby!<eos> - Yes, he just fell asleep. - He just fell asleep.<eos> You had a baby?<eos> You old dogs!
I know that, Peter.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Maybe we should just let her process things and come to us when she's ready.<eos> How is she gonna process it if she doesn't know everything is what I'm saying.<eos> Well she's not gonna talk to you either.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Tony, how do you feel about leaving your aunt Becca a message?<eos> She's not my aunt Becca.<eos> - Come on. - You guys are liars.<eos> You lied to her and you lied to me.

You could've just told us the truth.<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> You're right, dad.<eos> I don't know what I'm talking about because you never tell me anything.
And your grandmother wouldn't let me see Beth anymore after she got pregnant.<eos> She blamed me.<eos> I went off and joined the army to get as far away as I could and... - Seriously?<eos> - Just listen to me.<eos> What? But I was not trying to get away from Beth or from you.<eos> I was never running away from you.<eos> What are you telling me?<eos> You're my daughter, too.<eos> How could you do this?<eos> How could you both do this?
Everyday.<eos> What do I say to her?<eos> Hi, I'm your mother.<eos> I was a complete slut and I don't know who your father is.<eos> Do you wanna meet her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> You don't need to rush it.<eos> Give her the information she wants.<eos> And if you need to meet her, you'll both figure it out at some point.
No.<eos> To my bony Becca, my beloved girl who bewitched me the moment her eyes flashed at mine.<eos> By now you have learned the truth and no doubt you are angry at me, and Beth, and Peter for robbing you the reality of the circumstances of your birth.<eos> You are no longer a girl, but a grown person of great mind and heart.<eos> I ask you to reach deep inside yourself and ask, what should've been done?<eos> A girl was not ready to be a mother and a woman who's not yet finished being one.<eos> It wasn't ideal, but I knew how to keep you whole so you could grow up to have all the strength you needed to understand that your life was filled with true love, not true labels.<eos> I loved being your mother, grandmother, and friend.<eos> And to my Tony, you might just be old enough to realize how lucky you are to have a sister.<eos> I hope you will be closer to her than anyone else because you two need each other.

God, why would you even do that?<eos> Okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> I won't.<eos> You know, this is not like the last time.<eos> This is not a loan. Okay.<eos> This is an investment.<eos> I get it. Fine.<eos> You will get every cent back and more.<eos> You know, you and dad invest in stocks all the time.
They're amazing.<eos> Why can't you just tell your mom?<eos> She could like totally help you.<eos> It's just that if she helps me, I might never know what part is me and what part is her and if<eos> I'm gonna do this, then I need to know what I'm really capable of, you know?<eos> Like really capable of as in alone.<eos> No, this is a disaster!<eos> If you're gonna do the Gotham Ganache then you have to try the Harlem truffles.<eos> - Sure. - Okay. Okay, get me half a dozen Gotham Ganache and twelve<eos> Harlem truffles. You heard the boss, boys.
Thoth, God of Wisdom!<eos> Greetings, Thoth.<eos> Did you ever imagine that your former student would one day wear the crown of Egypt?<eos> Horus evinced a range of attributes, some of which may well correlate with a leadership position.<eos> If he's lucky.<eos> Praise Osiris!<eos> King of all Egypt!<eos> Hail Ra, Lord of Light.<eos> Hail Ra, Lord of Light!<eos> My father has seen fit to bless this day as you all bless us with your generosity.
Well, this truly is a big day for the family.<eos> I, Set... shall be your one true king.<eos> King of all Egypt!<eos> Behold the fate of those who stand in my way.<eos> Gods... Bow before me or die.<eos> Mortals, worship me or be enslaved!<eos> Bek!<eos> My brother thought the Afterlife was a gift.<eos> I think a king should have higher standards.<eos> From now on, you have to buy your way in with riches earned.
If you bring Zaya back.<eos> There may be a way.<eos> No one may leave the Afterlife once entered.<eos> But the journey through the Nine Gates will take several days to complete.<eos> And only the King can make Anubis turn back.<eos> If I kill Set and take back the crown before your beloved reaches the Final Gate,<eos> I might be able to save her.<eos> Try to keep up.<eos> My magnificent bloody hounds.<eos> You are the true sons of Egypt.

Your company was preferable.<eos> Outrageous!<eos> You're welcome for saving your life. So while I was sitting blind in my father's tomb, you shared a bed with the god who pulled out my eyes.<eos> Why would I waste this on someone who can't see?<eos> Why would I ever trust you again?<eos> He's slaying all the gods who won't bow to him.<eos> That includes me.<eos> We're breaking into Set's temple.<eos> Horus is going to kill him.<eos> How were you planning to get in?
You always did take me for granted.<eos> What?<eos> With your eye back, you should have come to get me. - Oh?<eos> - Don't I mean enough to you?<eos> Be a dear and fetch me some clean water.<eos> Would it kill you to say "please"?<eos> I'm really not in the mood to argue.<eos> Go get it for me.<eos> I command you.<eos> You're all the same, aren't you?
He deserves to know the truth.<eos> I need him to get us in to choke Set's fire.<eos> If he refuses, we'll all die.<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> It's too dangerous to cross the plain.<eos> - We'll wait for darkness.<eos> - But we're running out of time.<eos> - I say we cross now.<eos> - And I say we wait.<eos> All the time you were apart, she never forgot you.
Go on.<eos> Ask him.<eos> - Pour it in.<eos> - Is it true?<eos> Bek, pour it in!<eos> No!<eos> Shame you weren't on my side.<eos> I admire someone that doesn't let death stand in his way.<eos> But this is what love gets you.<eos> It's quite fitting that you'll both die together here in my house.
- You know that's a lie.<eos> - Please, brothers and sisters.<eos> - Reason?<eos> Ask the Dennehys how far reasoning got them.<eos> He burned all the Dennehys' crops!<eos> - Our farms are rotting. - That's right.<eos> It's only a matter of time before he drives all of us out of here.<eos> For the sake of our children, I believe it's time we leave Rose Creek.<eos> - To where? - And where are we gonna go?<eos> - I know you're scared. - I've given everything I have.
All of us.<eos> Together.<eos> This valley is ours.<eos> - I agree with Matthew.<eos> - I'm with Matthew.<eos> This is the Lord's house.<eos> It's no place for guns.<eos> There are women and children.<eos> Mr. Bogue.<eos> This is what you love, what you'd die for.
Look at me, boy.<eos> Come on up here.<eos> Come on, boy.<eos> Come on!<eos> It's okay, son.<eos> Now, I come here for gold.<eos> Gold.<eos> This country has long equated democracy with capitalism, capitalism with God.<eos> So you're standing not only in the way of progress and capital.<eos> You're standing in the way of God!
Three days past?<eos> Best you remember who'd you cheat out of $50 in a card game!<eos> I assure you I did not have to cheat to beat the likes of you two.<eos> Easy.<eos> Gentlemen, allow me a moment to show you something quite miraculous.<eos> You just show us our money, Faraday!<eos> Fifty-two cards.<eos> - Pick a card.<eos> - We ain't playing no game.<eos> You've got the drop on me.
Bartholomew Bogue.<eos> Bart Bogue?<eos> The robber baron?<eos> Means there's gold in the equation, but gold don't do you much good when you're buried with it.<eos> You want out, feel free to leave.<eos> Just leave my horse.<eos> 'Cause I paid for it.<eos> Just speaking out loud.<eos> Twenty miles east of here. Volcano Springs. Supply station.<eos> You look for a Cajun, name of Robicheaux.
- That's right.<eos> The Angel of Death.<eos> Meet me outside of Junction City in three days.<eos> Yeah, I ain't there, then it means I'm dead and you can... You can keep my horse.<eos> You're with me. Come on, let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Three days.<eos> The gun. The gun!<eos> Give it to him.<eos> He was already dead, if that's what you're wondering.
Well, this is quite the welcome party.<eos> - Where is everybody?<eos> - I think we killed 'em all.<eos> No, they're here.<eos> They just want to make sure their candle is lit before they blow out the match.<eos> Everyone! Come on! Come out!<eos> - Come out!<eos> - Come on out, everybody!<eos> What's the matter with y'all?<eos> Don't you see what they just did?
Mr. Chisolm?<eos> My name is Sam Chisolm, and I'm a duly sworn warrant officer in Wichita, Kansas.<eos> Also, a licensed peace officer in the Indian Territories, Arkansas and seven other states.<eos> Now, what happened here was just an opening skirmish.<eos> The real battle is yet to come.<eos> The idea is that when it comes, it'll be on our terms.<eos> - On our terms?<eos> - Yeah, there's no way in hell.<eos> Son of a bitch'll come back with 200 men and slaughter us all.<eos> If you want to leave, leave.

All right, now.<eos> Fire when ready.<eos> Fire!<eos> Think I pinched my finger.<eos> Bless their hearts.<eos> That's hard to do.<eos> This many men and miss that many targets?<eos> Twice?<eos> I'm looking at a line of dead men.<eos> You gotta hate what you're firing at!
Move it, you lazy dogs!<eos> Move that gold out!<eos> That sounded like a gunshot!<eos> It's coming from the cliff.<eos> - Who was that? - I don't know.<eos> These ain't Bogue's guys.<eos> Yup.<eos> They done killed them all.<eos> This mine is now closed.<eos> You men are free to go.

The rest of y'all stand to the side!<eos> We're gonna need another ditch by the livery. See that?<eos> Good, and heave! - All right, tie it up, now. - Put your weapon...<eos> Make sure you paint the whole thing.<eos> Very smart, smoking, huh?<eos> - Three minutes.<eos> - That's too much land to cover.<eos> Where did them eggs come from?<eos> A chicken's ass, you dummy.<eos> Did I introduce you to my wife?
Watch your step.<eos> Steady.<eos> Chisolm?<eos> It's him, all right.<eos> Mr. Denali.<eos> Keep it clear!<eos> - Come on! - Steady!<eos> - Mask up. - All together. Come on.<eos> Bring 'em up!<eos> Shoot whoever you see!
Fill yourself with His spirit and I will chase away your demons.<eos> The spirit led you here.<eos> You have nothing to fear.<eos> Take it.<eos> No, please.<eos> Take it.<eos> Behold...<eos> Your faith, even as tiny as a mustard seed, can move mountains.<eos> This is the message from the son of God!<eos> The miracles I do, you can do also.

Keys.<eos> Get up.<eos> Open this door.<eos> I missed the first five shots.<eos> I mean, I must have picked the quickest Mexican out of the whole bloody bunch.<eos> Mine damn near got to the river!<eos> Monte said that's the farthest any Mexican ever made it!<eos> God damn it, that was a hell of a time.<eos> What do you figure on doing with that?<eos> You two put your fucking guns down slowly.

You and you, take everyone's pistols and put them over there.<eos> You killed my son.<eos> I hear your wife's sick.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> I'm going to sit and wait.<eos> You paid good money to come here, right?<eos> How much were those Mexicans worth?<eos> How much?<eos> Two hundred a hunt. $200 per hunt!<eos> And that's what you call it?
My boy.<eos> Let me do this, Father.<eos> Let me help you up, son.<eos> David?<eos> I'll do it on one condition.<eos> When it's done, my wife leaves here with me.<eos> Put your guns away, gentlemen.<eos> There'll be no more shooting today.<eos> We'll meet outside, 8:00.<eos> Good people of Mount Hermon, you're about to witness a Helena duel.
Mr. Kingston.<eos> A most noble affair of character and honor.<eos> I took David's father with this knife over 20 years ago.<eos> The one he now grips is stained with my blood from that same duel and now will surely drip red with my son's.<eos> If Isaac lives, he will be forgiven his ill-considered behavior and he will undoubtedly be the better man for what he experiences here tonight.<eos> Does me proud.<eos> If David is victor, then in fairness, he will be taken to his wife and she will decide their fate.<eos> On this, you have my word.<eos> Gentlemen, come together.<eos> You shall pour out each other's blood... and we will cover it with dust.
Franck Provost!<eos> - It is a spray, a gift for Mrs. Ginette.<eos> It is for stiffening the hair.<eos> - A torch!<eos> Very effective in igniting the wick.<eos> Pen! Odd.<eos> It contains ink and produces music!<eos> Silence!<eos> A capital punishment is called for and without delay.<eos> If you have something to say, say it quickly.
Charlotte Robespierre?<eos> - Welfare and brotherhood!<eos> - It is better for the revolution to let him rest.<eos> I am here instead.<eos> Committee of the Public Safety is interested in a relationship between the prosecutor Jacquouillete and the culprit.<eos> This individual is linking himself to the family, he is an English spy.<eos> Jacquouille was born by Montmiraile.<eos> Well, I'm a bastard of the laborer Anselm and the big assed Gertrude.<eos> Inspector, they express themselves with a local dialect.<eos> You are making a mistake.
- My uncle?<eos> He was arrested by Verdier.<eos> - How so? Did he not die in prison?<eos> No!<eos> He got out. Thanks to his mate, he is a giant.<eos> He is so tiny, he could not get out alive.<eos> He is not smaller than you.<eos> - I'm normal.<eos> Not really!<eos> You are truly a family of wee people.
Watch out, sir, that clown looks like a real ass!<eos> I'm with you!<eos> - Stop squishing me!<eos> I'm sorry, Sir, I am using your great strength to get out. - It's a chump.<eos> That's all.<eos> - What an ass.<eos> Let's hurry!<eos> Faster!<eos> The stepmother's upstairs? - Chateau Montmirail by Issoudun<eos> Ma'am, at dawn, you are required to be gone.
Victoria, you will not stay here!<eos> - Who will take Kurt to town?<eos> Do not discuss anything so near the National Guard.<eos> - Board! Now!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Why toss our luggage on the ground?<eos> I will not go with you!<eos> - Stop or I will hit you!<eos> We paid to go to Vienna!<eos> - And you went to Paris, so stay.
It's the Alsatian branch of the family Malfete.<eos> Alsace is French? Yes.<eos> - Who's going to pay me those 10 sous?<eos> The deputy, we are at the deputy.<eos> - And add 5 sous for the cast.<eos> I will fix Marat's beautiful statue, which was smashed by your clan.<eos> The citizen actress is here, eh?<eos> Good that she is hidden.<eos> Beauty, tough to maintain.<eos> - What are you talking about?
Yes, it stinks!<eos> - You are clever, eh?<eos> - It stinks! He is a coward!<eos> Pissing his pants!<eos> Gonzague is a sissy!<eos> Enough!<eos> Remember, you are a lackey!<eos> You are annoying me, Austrians.<eos> I don't go backwards.<eos> You are Barbarians!
- Yes, but I shortened it with the sword.<eos> He destroyed the suit that cost a fortune.<eos> I did not know that I was destroying something.<eos> So those two unfortunate souls hid with me.<eos> This is a good material for an article.<eos> - Sure.<eos> I'll publish it in the morning.<eos> Thank you for the notice about those poor people.<eos> The republic must wake up, and give a proper... honor to those poor souls.<eos> What do you think, citizens?
You smell of death. You are not going to be here for long.<eos> You have to find a cure, while it is possible.<eos> You have oozing boils, you will croak soon.<eos> What is it they say?<eos> - We'd better go.<eos> Get a move on, out.<eos> Marat has a lot of work we cannot bother him.<eos> What the... what do they say?<eos> Are they talking about me?<eos> Why did you say he was sick?
You have oozing boils, you will croak soon.<eos> What is it they say?<eos> - We'd better go.<eos> Get a move on, out.<eos> Marat has a lot of work we cannot bother him.<eos> What the... what do they say?<eos> Are they talking about me?<eos> Why did you say he was sick?<eos> - Because he is.<eos> Such sincerity will cause you nothing but problems.
Are not you afraid to get on the podium, citizens?<eos> The audience is not an easy crowd.<eos> - I do not know fear, great commander.<eos> We can explain it and give them a couple of slaps.<eos> And kick them in the balls just like the steward of the Limousin.<eos> And then one fine morning... we will croak!<eos> Let them hang us!<eos> Hooray not-to-church!<eos> Charlotte, can you let us discuss something?<eos> Come, gentlemen, I will give you a dessert.
Someone warned them!<eos> You can always wait for Malfete.<eos> Stop!<eos> Papers.<eos> - Permit.<eos> Ambassador of the United Provinces of Holland.<eos> Mr. citizen, we are on the street of herbs!<eos> Come!<eos> Sir, your nose is all red and it is swinging.<eos> And you are wrinkly like an old crone.
Fast! Fast!<eos> I'm choking.<eos> I'm choking!<eos> I am like a frog!<eos> The drink is ready, now just the viper's venom.<eos> Shut up!<eos> It is urgent!<eos> I'll croak!<eos> I cannot wait to be back in my time.<eos> - You will return with the potion.
Yes!<eos> We are in our region, Jacquouille.<eos> We did it!<eos> You have your hefty body again.<eos> Body?<eos> - We are in a time of knights, rascal!<eos> I almost listened to your whims!<eos> The castle guard is waiting for us.<eos> This is a great lie!<eos> You swore and lied!
We did it!<eos> You have your hefty body again.<eos> Body?<eos> - We are in a time of knights, rascal!<eos> I almost listened to your whims!<eos> The castle guard is waiting for us.<eos> This is a great lie!<eos> You swore and lied!<eos> - Stop.<eos> You're damned to hell!
You swore and lied!<eos> - Stop.<eos> You're damned to hell!<eos> - To swear to a serf, that is wrong.<eos> You are not a noble, it seems to me!<eos> Be on your way, you rascal!<eos> It is a big shame!<eos> It is a big shame!<eos> Citizens!<eos> Citizens, where are you?
We went back to the time of cars!<eos> Let's dance gig!<eos> Silence!<eos> This is enemy soldiery!<eos> They speak Germanic!<eos> They conquered my castle tower!<eos> Germans?<eos> My bastard is imprisoned by Germany!<eos> Jacquard is imprisoned by Germany!<eos> Here you are!
We are in trouble, we're stuck in time.<eos> At least there'll be no more of that potion!<eos> - Be respectful, bastard!<eos> No, no beating!<eos> Stop or I will shoot!<eos> Welfare and brotherhood, citizens!<eos> - Hands up!<eos> Captain! These men were spying on us.<eos> What about them?<eos> What do you want?
You are continuing the line.<eos> Do you know the Montmirails?<eos> - Do I not resemble the first Count?<eos> Are these emblems yours?<eos> It's weird, you look like the painting.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> - From the castle.<eos> We escaped through the chimney before the Teutons.<eos> - On Germany!<eos> You know the entrance to the underground?
You want a sandwich?<eos> You want some eggs maybe?<eos> - The waffles are really good.<eos> Right, Trev?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, the waffles are good or, yeah, your penis works?<eos> The waffles suck.<eos> - I'm Dot.<eos> - Trevor.<eos> You two perverts got room for one more?
Because she wants to play him.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> I know this may not be the ideal choice, but let me tell you something, if she gets attached, other stars hear about it and they start sniffing around, and next thing you know, Mark Wahlberg.<eos> - Dirk Diggler.<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Is she playing him as a girl, or as a girl playing a guy?<eos> If Hilary Swank gets on board, this movie gets made.<eos> - Which means you guys get paid.
- Sykes!<eos> Aren't you a little old for that, soldier?<eos> No, Sarge, it's for...<eos> It's for my daughter.<eos> Life during wartime.<eos> Okay, guys, these are your seats right here.<eos> Got you the best row in the house.<eos> This is Mr. Oglesby's reserved section.<eos> Make yourself at home.<eos> You need anything, you let me know.
Sergeant, request permission to switch seats.<eos> Permission denied, Specialist Lynn.<eos> You will take it for the team.<eos> Move out and draw fire.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Hi.<eos> I saw you on the TV.<eos> It was just like a movie.<eos> I was just so proud.<eos> You guys are the best.
Hi.<eos> I saw you on the TV.<eos> It was just like a movie.<eos> I was just so proud.<eos> You guys are the best.<eos> I'm right there with you.<eos> No.<eos> Not with you in Iraq, but...<eos> My cousin's girlfriend's brother is also serving in Iraq.<eos> You remind of my dear late husband, Fred.
You guys are the best.<eos> I'm right there with you.<eos> No.<eos> Not with you in Iraq, but...<eos> My cousin's girlfriend's brother is also serving in Iraq.<eos> You remind of my dear late husband, Fred.<eos> I wear a uniform, too, but...<eos> I must have watched your video, like...<eos> Then we could drop a big one on Fallujah.<eos> But you boys, you're the real thing.
- Good job.<eos> Very cool.<eos> Josh, man, I'm starving right now.<eos> Can we please stop and get a slice of pizza,<eos> - a hot dog, something?<eos> - I'm sorry, man, we just...<eos> We have to head to the end zone now for the video shoot.<eos> - What video shoot?<eos> - They didn't tell you guys?<eos> You're gonna be starring in the official team greeting.
Bring him to the end zone.<eos> - Yes, Sarge.<eos> - Josh?<eos> - Advil?<eos> - Oh, shit, shit.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry. Yes, yes.<eos> I will definitely get that for you right away.<eos> Okay. Okay, so you guys can just wait right here, and I will go tell them that we're ready.
- Hey!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Let's go! - Ready, aim, fire!<eos> - Play football, Albert?<eos> - I play a little bit.<eos> - Get off me!<eos> - Get the hell off my field!<eos> Get off now! Get off!<eos> - Mango, Mango, Mango!<eos> - Hey, you!
I mean, like...<eos> Watch 'em die?<eos> Yes.<eos> What's that feel like?<eos> It doesn't feel like anything.<eos> Not while it's happening.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> - You can tell us.<eos> - Come on.<eos> What's it feel like when you hit somebody?
What's that feel like?<eos> It doesn't feel like anything.<eos> Not while it's happening.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> - You can tell us.<eos> - Come on.<eos> What's it feel like when you hit somebody?<eos> Like, really connect.<eos> Look at the crap they use to protect themselves.<eos> - Do you guys have half this shit?
- Do you guys have half this shit?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Grab an equipment bag and you can take some back.<eos> Do it.<eos> Hey, Billy, find where they're keeping the steroids?<eos> Roy.<eos> You remember my wife, Nikki.<eos> Tiffany. Excuse me.<eos> Hello.<eos> Thrilled you could come.
Foo, get them up!<eos> Get up!<eos> Get up! Get the fuck up!<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> - Come on!<eos> Don't fuckin' move!<eos> Don't fuckin' move!<eos> You stay right there.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You stay!
Don't fuckin' move!<eos> You stay right there.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You stay!<eos> - Foo, check the back.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - All clear.<eos> - Room clear.<eos> - Check that kitchen.<eos> - Do you have any weapons?
- Foo, check the back.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - All clear.<eos> - Room clear.<eos> - Check that kitchen.<eos> - Do you have any weapons?<eos> No.<eos> He doesn't have anything.<eos> He says to tell you there's nothing here.<eos> Are you working with the anti-coalition forces?
- Do you have any weapons?<eos> No.<eos> He doesn't have anything.<eos> He says to tell you there's nothing here.<eos> Are you working with the anti-coalition forces?<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> He is a simple man.<eos> He's taking care of his family.<eos> He is not the enemy.<eos> Are you hiding anyone or anything?
He doesn't need to be hearing all this propaganda...<eos> Kathryn.<eos> They could cripple the economy, force widespread quarantines, and cause sickness and death.<eos> So, how's it going?<eos> It's weird.<eos> I mean, we got rid of their dictator, and now they're fighting each other as well as us.<eos> We're getting 'em sewer systems and building schools, and they don't even have textbooks.<eos> We're soldiers.<eos> What do we know about stuff like that?<eos> I'm sure y'all are doing the best you can.
Hit him! Hit him!<eos> Get that motherfucker! Get that motherfucker!<eos> Go!<eos> Go, go, go, go!<eos> - Come on, D!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - Come on, D!<eos> - Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> D-line, you're getting blown back!
- Come on!<eos> - Come on, D!<eos> - Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> D-line, you're getting blown back!<eos> Johnson hasn't filled that gap in two seasons.<eos> Foo, you haven't filled the gap<eos> - in, like, three years.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Losers, you suck!
Well, listen, brotherly love is a great thing, but all these people in this stadium want to see you ride away into the sunset with the girl.<eos> Without a woman, you ain't got shit, Billy.<eos> That's why I got married.<eos> Got to get your priorities straight.<eos> Listen, don't worry, we're gonna get this movie made right.<eos> Fuck 'em.<eos> - Fuck who?<eos> - The studios.<eos> You guys keep protecting America, I'll keep pitching.<eos> You guys are the real heroes, man.

Good.<eos> Okay.<eos> First off, what are y'all gonna wear?<eos> What we're wearing, ma'am.<eos> These are our dress uniforms.<eos> No way.<eos> I'm already drowning in dress uniforms.<eos> I need you boys to really stand out, you know?<eos> Give me some of that "bring it on" attitude.<eos> You guys are gonna be right up there, on stage with Destiny's Child.

Let's go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Out of the way, please!<eos> Out of the way!<eos> Come on.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Come on, let's stick together!<eos> - Sykes, are you all right?<eos> - I'm fine, Sergeant.<eos> There you are!

There you are!<eos> Okay, that was kind of hairy, but you guys made it.<eos> Now, when this screen flies up, I want you guys to step out and march down the stairs.<eos> And for you, you have an extra cue.<eos> You know "Soldier"?<eos> The song Soldier.<eos> In the first bridge where they sing, "They wanna spend that on me,"<eos> that's your signal to move to your special mark downstage.<eos> Now, here's the important part.<eos> Once y'all hit your marks, you have to stay absolutely still until the show's over no matter what is going on around you.

Billy.<eos> Hey, Billy.<eos> Halftime show's over.<eos> Dude, we finally saw Beyoncé.<eos> Yeah, well, ain't we fuckin' special.<eos> Sergeant, I feel bad.<eos> That was some kind of fucked-up shit.<eos> Just another normal day in America, Billy.<eos> We strike the set in nine minutes.<eos> You guys have to go.
We strike the set in nine minutes.<eos> You guys have to go.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Hey.<eos> I told you get the hell off my stage.<eos> - Dude, don't touch me.<eos> - Chill out, chill out.<eos> - Nobody told us where to go.<eos> - Come on.<eos> I don't give a fuck where you go.

Stage manager said we should look more "battle-ready" for halftime.<eos> Well, ready or not, you still look pretty darn cute.<eos> Really?<eos> And you looked great.<eos> That trippy little step you were doing earlier.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - What's wrong with him?<eos> Sykes is kind of an emotional guy.<eos> He just misses his wife and kids.<eos> The sacrifices you guys make.
- Losers.<eos> Come on.<eos> Dude, what the fuck happened to your eye?<eos> Dude, what happened to your face?<eos> Hey, Travis, man. Don't mess with these guys.<eos> These guys are the Bravos.<eos> The what-hos?<eos> Yeah, I heard of you guys.<eos> Goddamn.<eos> You're famous?
Come on.<eos> Dude, what the fuck happened to your eye?<eos> Dude, what happened to your face?<eos> Hey, Travis, man. Don't mess with these guys.<eos> These guys are the Bravos.<eos> The what-hos?<eos> Yeah, I heard of you guys.<eos> Goddamn.<eos> You're famous?<eos> Tell me something, Bravos. What do you think about gays in the military?
Like maybe it's got something to do with why we're getting our butts kicked in Iraq.<eos> Shit, Billy, this guy seriously needs to shut the fuck up.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yup.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> Why don't you join up?<eos> Why don't you get in a foxhole with me and see what happens?<eos> Hey, man, I'm just messing with you, all right?<eos> "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," I'm totally down with that.<eos> I don't give a shit if you guys are gay, bi, tranny.

That's the sound of us getting fucked.<eos> Dave, have some faith, man.<eos> Look, Norm ain't no... He ain't no Santa Claus.<eos> We all know that.<eos> In fact, they floated around an idea of making you two the stars<eos> - and forgetting about the others.<eos> - No.<eos> That's what I said.<eos> I said Bravo lives by the warrior code.<eos> You guys don't leave anyone behind.
I'm on your team, okay?<eos> Relax.<eos> I am relaxed.<eos> Billy's relaxed, too.<eos> - Aren't you, Billy?<eos> - Totally relaxed, Sergeant.<eos> - He's totally relaxed.<eos> - Okay, hang with me.<eos> Guys, I'm gonna get you there, okay?<eos> So, right now what they're offering is, you'll be deferring monies up front against a net profit percentage on the back end.
I do, Dave.<eos> I truly do.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> So you're saying this is the best offer we got?<eos> I'm saying this is the only offer we got.<eos> I got to call the men.<eos> Holliday.<eos> Will you ask the guys what they think of $5,500 apiece?<eos> ...fucking apiece, guys.<eos> What do you think?
Now, we need maximum flexibility to get this movie together.<eos> But your risk won't be greater than it is for any other investor, myself included.<eos> May I speak frankly, sir?<eos> Why stop now?<eos> We're soldiers, sir.<eos> We feel like we've already got enough risk in our lives.<eos> Now, I understand that 100,000 might have been an overly optimistic number, but after all they've been through, my men don't deserve to be stuck in somebody's bottom line.<eos> Now, if you can just find it in your heart...<eos> Sergeant Dime, my offer stands.<eos> Now, it may not be as much as you fellas were hoping for, but from what I hear, it's the only offer you've got.
I do like you.<eos> I think the world of you fine young men.<eos> See, Billy?<eos> He does like us.<eos> He likes us so much he's gonna fuck us in the face.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> The sergeant and I need to have a little talk.<eos> You don't have to go, Billy.<eos> Let Sergeant Dime cool off a bit.<eos> Could you excuse us for a moment?
It's America's story now.<eos> That's what this country's built on.<eos> You take this great state of Texas, cattle, land, oil.<eos> Those things made us rich.<eos> But what made us Texas is the story of some local boys that made a valiant stand at the Alamo.<eos> And so it is with this war, Billy.<eos> It's all about ideas.<eos> Your battle foreshadows America's triumph over the forces of terror.<eos> Bravo is us.<eos> And that's why you got to get your boys to accept my offer.
Hello, people there,<eos> I'm George Harrison and I play solo guitar, yeah.<eos> This is Ringo Starr and I play drums.<eos> And this is John Lennon, and I play better guitar.<eos> They were like a gang, do you know what I mean? They each had their little characteristic.<eos> I mean, John was surprisingly fearless.<eos> Paul was surprisingly cute.<eos> Ringo was cheeky and irresistible.<eos> And George was the one that my sister was in love with.<eos> Now, you're tremendously lively and full of zing on the stage, how difficult is it for you to keep up this zest?
Now, you're tremendously lively and full of zing on the stage, how difficult is it for you to keep up this zest?<eos> Well, we do the zest we can.<eos> I've spent my whole career, in a way, trying to recapture in things that I write, the hilarity of four friends, one drink down, age 19, laughing at their jokes and all the new stuff that they find really funny.<eos> The Beatles were kind of the dream of how you might be with your friends as you went through life.<eos> All screaming, screaming, that's the man of the year, and you say, "Why do they scream?"<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - No. I couldn't tell you.<eos> If somebody scores a goal, there's a louder cheer from all the people, so if we shake our heads, it's the equivalent of scoring a goal, and that's when the screams are loudest.<eos> Do you see what I mean?<eos> Yes, yes I do understand. You do that and they scream.
It's not culture. - What is it?<eos> - It's a good laugh.<eos> This is Harold James.<eos> And now, from the Washington D.C. Coliseum, the world's most exciting group, Capitol Recording stars, The Beatles.<eos> You know, the suits. It's the simplest of ideas.<eos> It suddenly made us one person. A four-headed monster.<eos> Thank you very much, everybody, and good evening, how do you do?<eos> We would like to sing a song which we recorded on an LP that we made.<eos> That's English for "album". An album that we made.<eos> And we'd like you, if you would, to sort of join in and clap your hands, you know, and stamp your feet.
The very earliest records were all pleas to the fans.<eos> And it was all personal article.<eos> In the early days, we didn't count lyrics at all, you know, as long as it had some vague theme.<eos> She loves you, and he loves him, and they love each other.<eos> It's all direct. It was kind of conscious.<eos> We were actually appealing to girls.<eos> We were young boys who were appealing to girls, you know, to get our fan base.<eos> In those days...<eos> - Go on.<eos> - You yourselves, you know, you write very good songs.

Thank you.
It was a different kind of fame, because we didn't have social media, we didn't have satellite television, and yet the word would spread that this group were coming.<eos> Once it was big in one country, it got bigger in the next.<eos> Australia, there was more people came to see us there than anywhere.<eos> I mean, it looked like, I think the whole of Australia was there.<eos> 'Along the nine-mile route from Adelaide Airport to the city, 'almost a quarter of a million people lined the streets.'<eos> My picture of it now is... There was a ship, going to discover the new world, you know?<eos> And The Beatles were in the crow's nest, and we just said, "Land ho!"<eos> # Oh, you can't do that # And so we were all on this ship in the '60s, not just Beatles but our movement, our generation, and we went somewhere.<eos> And of course the next most extraordinary thing is the fantasy version of The Beatles from '64.<eos> # I should be sleeping like a log... # You fancy yourselves as actors then, do you?
Fans, Beatles, fun, excitement, music.<eos> And of course, everybody in the world could buy tickets to see them.<eos> What you're seeing is the emergence of this international teen culture.<eos> If you're 14 in 1964, who are you looking to for cues?<eos> Not your parents.<eos> Beatles hysteria is kind of a muscle flexing of that generation, the Baby Boom.<eos> It's no accident you see all this kind of youth culture coming out of that time, because quite literally the society is dominated by teenagers.<eos> # You know I feel all right #<eos> The first time we went to America, it was just 10 days, so when we came back, we knew they were waiting for us.<eos> Tell me, several people on these radio programmes want to know, what do you plan to do when the bubble bursts?
We need protection, we've got a record to do tomorrow.<eos> I need protection. And you shall have it.<eos> Get me protection.<eos> We'd enjoyed very much doing A Hard Day's Night.<eos> We had kinda taken it seriously, but with the film Help!<eos> we were kinda pretty disinterested.<eos> You know, we were now doing it again, and so it couldn't be quite as exciting as the first time.<eos> The main thing I remember is, we all had meetings about tax structure and they would sorta say, oh you've gotta put your money in the Bahamas or somewhere.<eos> So when we were asked about the film, we would say, "Can we go to The Bahamas?"<eos> We were told, you're gonna film in the Bahamas.
I mean, that was the first time it was used for a rock concert.<eos> Vox made us special big amplifiers for that tour and they were like a hundred watts...<eos> And it just obviously, you know, wasn't enough.<eos> Now ladies and gentlemen, here are The Beatles.<eos> Here they come.<eos> - Oh, oh! - Hello! - Hey!<eos> - Hello, Paul.<eos> We'd like to do a song from...<eos> What LP is it on? Off our LP album, Beatles VI, I think.<eos> Can you hear me?
'Formal occasion at Buckingham Palace on a foggy October morning.<eos> 'The ceremony is bestowing awards of honour, 'a ceremony hallowed by tradition going back over the centuries.<eos> 'Members of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.'<eos> 'Do you think The Beatles should have been awarded the M.B.E.?<eos> ' 'Well, I... I think The Beatles have probably done as much for popular music 'as people like Rodgers and Hammerstein and Gershwin did, 'the only difference being that The Beatles have done it 'in a matter of two or three years,<eos> 'whereas it took most other people a lifetime.'<eos> 'What's the M.B.E. going to do to your teenage rebel image?<eos> ' - Who's got a teenage rebel image? - Well, you have.<eos> - Have we?<eos> - No. Have any of you any ambitions left at all?
# And I'm still... # There weren't, like, big plans.<eos> You know, sometimes it just unfolded. Complete fluke.<eos> OK, ready?<eos> John was not mechanically minded, and he took a tape on, and the tape had run off to the other reel, and he put it on like it was the start, but it was the end of the song and that's when the guitar came.<eos> And he brings it in, "Ah, you've gotta hear this."<eos> And we said, great, we've gotta do that, so...<eos> # It is shining #<eos> And I always remember being in Brian Epstein's house and John playing it to Brian and to George Martin, and saying, "What do you think of this?" you know.<eos> But you could see this puzzlement going across their faces, but instead of saying,<eos> "Ah, come on, guys, I think you really oughta put another chord in,"
We got on a train and went up to Hamburg.<eos> By then I don't think we wanted to be anywhere.<eos> It was like automatic pilot, you know?<eos> There was so much more pressure from the press trying to get at you, you know, for whatever reason.<eos> - We're not horrid snobby. - Yes, you are.<eos> - No, we seem like...<eos> - That's your version.<eos> Maybe it's only in your mind that we are.<eos> Because we're not flattering you.<eos> You know, you expect sort of nice answers to all the questions, but if the questions aren't nice questions, they don't have to have nice answers.
It's amazing security. I've never seen so many people guarding us.<eos> So we don't want you to be hurt or anything, so we're trying our best.<eos> Everywhere we were going, it was a demonstration of one thing or another.<eos> In Japan, the people were demonstrating because the Budokan was supposed to be a special, spiritual hall and only reserved for martial arts, not pop music.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome... The Beatles.<eos> It was very strange.<eos> The audience were very reserved, respectful, very quiet to what we had become accustomed to. Very quiet.<eos> We were playing crap.<eos> We were just sort of surviving.<eos> We had a day off in the Philippines, in Manila, and then somebody said, you're supposed to be visiting the palace.
He's longing to break out of it, and do a joke, but he knows he can't.<eos> If I had said television is more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.<eos> You know, but as I just happened to be talking to a friend,<eos> I used the word Beatles, as a remote thing, not as what I think, because Beatles, as those other Beatles, like other people see us.<eos> I just said they are... are having more influence on kids and things than anything else, including Jesus, but I said it in that way, which is the wrong way, yep, yep.<eos> He was scared.<eos> We were all pretty scared.<eos> Most of the people in the room understood it. It's like one of those lines.<eos> But it... it didn't hold us back at all.<eos> Concert tomorrow night is far below a sell-out, how do you feel about...
But we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us<eos> It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit, and after that, well, 'cor the blimeys, heave the mo'.<eos> Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in the Royal Variety Show.<eos> This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because Love Me Do got into the Top Twenty, and we can't believe, really, that so many things have happened in between already.<eos> Just before I pass you over to Paul, I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year, and everyone who sent me gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October.<eos> I'd love to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. - In the meantime...<eos> - This is Paul here.<eos> Everything that John said goes for me too, especially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, cos all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June...<eos> ...when it was my birthday.<eos> Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year.
What's that for?<eos> A visual aid.<eos> Look, I'm never going to be able to speak their words if they are talking.<eos> But they might have some sort of written language or basis for visual communication.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> Human.<eos> "Human."<eos> I'm human.<eos> What are you?

"Eat." "Walk."<eos> Help me understand.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, no, no, not the top!<eos> Okay, this is where you wanna get to, right?<eos> - That is the question.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So, first we need to make sure that they understand what a question is. Okay?<eos> The nature of a request for information along with a response.<eos> Then, we need to clarify the difference between a specific "you" and a collective "you,"
Louise.<eos> Screw it.<eos> Everybody dies, right?<eos> Sir, Donnelly is taking off his hazmat suit.<eos> Permission to abort?<eos> Continue the session.<eos> Ian.<eos> Louise.<eos> You.<eos> Who are you?
- See. - I...<eos> Yeah, no, but between three and four.<eos> - All right, time to go. - Okay.<eos> Ninety-six minutes remaining in the session.<eos> Over.<eos> Heptapod's purpose.<eos> Heptapod purpose. Earth.<eos> What is your purpose?<eos> Do we only have Costello?<eos> Okay. There you are.
So, what are we calling this, session 37?<eos> No, 36, part two.<eos> Why they on their own?<eos> We've been attempting to hail Captain Marks.<eos> The escort units are not responding, sir.<eos> Why not?<eos> Send security.<eos> "Offer weapon.<eos> Question mark."<eos> Are you offering us something?
Costello?<eos> Where's Abbott?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We're sorry.<eos> I need you to...<eos> I need you to send a message to the other sites.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What is your purpose here?<eos> How can you know the future?
Excuse me!<eos> Are you out of your mind, girl?<eos> Marrying a German?<eos> Bloody baker.<eos> He's a good man.<eos> Not that that would make a difference to you anyway.<eos> You marry this man, it will be without my blessing.<eos> And without my money.<eos> God, the father, God, the son, God the Holy Ghost. Bless, preserve and keep you.<eos> The Lord mercifully with his favor look upon you. And so fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace, that you may so live together in this life. That in the world to come, you may have life everlasting.
-Where's the ten of hearts?<eos> -Here you are.<eos> No, it hasn't come up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Fold a card.<eos> Perhaps she has it.<eos> It's magic.<eos> No.<eos> You are a big cheat.<eos> You two are in it together.
This way.<eos> Shit.<eos> Planes again!<eos> -Murderers!<eos> -Run, they're coming back!<eos> Help!<eos> Open the door!<eos> -Open up!<eos> -You can't come in, it's full.<eos> You can't come in.
Shit.<eos> Planes again!<eos> -Murderers!<eos> -Run, they're coming back!<eos> Help!<eos> Open the door!<eos> -Open up!<eos> -You can't come in, it's full.<eos> You can't come in.<eos> You can't come in.
The Chronosphere powers the grand clock.<eos> But, I need it.<eos> Without it, the Hatter may never get better... and I have to...<eos> Wilkins?<eos> Stupid door.<eos> Did you call, sir?<eos> Wilkins, please remove this... yellow-haired kindergartener, here.<eos> Immediately, sir!<eos> No interlopers!<eos> Thank you for your you, sir.
Tick-Tock!<eos> Don't abandon me when I'm sulking!<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> The Chronosphere.<eos> Alice...<eos> No!<eos> Stop her!<eos> Stop her, you imbeciles!<eos> Which idiot labeled that?<eos> You did, my lord.
Don't worry, Hatter.<eos> I'll save you, and your family.<eos> Alice?<eos> The Alice?<eos> Slayer of my Jabber-baby-wocky?<eos> The very reason why I have been banished from my kingdom?<eos> That Alice?<eos> Idiot!<eos> I want her head!<eos> Are you all right, sir?
Wonderful!<eos> Indeed.<eos> Congratulations, dear Mirana, on your coming of age.<eos> And now... the heir.<eos> The crown for the Princess Iracebeth.<eos> Ignorant peasants.<eos> Quiet!<eos> What are you doing, you idiot?<eos> Put it on my head!<eos> You're making me look stupid.
Tarrant, wait!<eos> Your family will be lost... and you will have done nothing to stop it!<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll warn them myself.<eos> Mr. Hightopp!<eos> If I could just have a moment of your time.<eos> There's something terribly important you should know about.<eos> Mr. Hightopp?<eos> Our apologies.<eos> You know of my sister's... misfortune.
Cheer up, Tarrant.<eos> We'll have fun now that you're living here.<eos> It's tea time!<eos> Twinkle, twinkle little bat, how I wonder where you're at.<eos> Who's he?<eos> Greetings, underlings.<eos> I am Time.<eos> The infinite and immortal.<eos> The personification of time, itself.<eos> I know you may find this concept a little bit hard to digest... but, please, keep your bewilderment brief, and to the point.
I must have it back.<eos> But not that I'm concerned.<eos> As soon as possible.<eos> Either way, I'm fine with the outcome.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Who knows about it?<eos> Well, you are in luck, oh, timely one... because, just today...<eos> I invited Alice to tea.<eos> Wait.<eos> Why don't you have a seat, and we can wait together.
No room.<eos> No room.<eos> Plenty of room.<eos> Tea for our guest.<eos> Tea time!<eos> We're having such a lovely time, here.<eos> Would ya like a scone?<eos> Scone.<eos> No.<eos> So... if you are really time itself... yourself, or whatever suchness you claim... Scone! perhaps you can answer me this.
And a nice head deserves a very nice hat.<eos> That's what my father says.<eos> He makes the best hats in Witzend.<eos> Would you like him to make you one?<eos> Come on.<eos> He can make any hat... or bonnet, or boater, dunce hat, fez, a cloche, coif, snood... barboosh, or pugree.<eos> You're eating all the tarts.<eos> You can have the crusts.<eos> I don't want the crusts.<eos> If you can't get along... there'll be no more tarts, for either of you.

Anyone?<eos> They're not here?<eos> They're not here.<eos> But I was certain that they were here.<eos> I... I could feel it.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Father?<eos> Mother!<eos> Everyone, it's you!<eos> Teeny-tiny you, but still you.
It's time... for... ze hour!<eos> It's time.<eos> Oh, this is all my fault.<eos> I stole the Chronosphere.<eos> I think you may have to steal it again.<eos> She ate my schnozzle.<eos> And my fingers.<eos> And my elbow!<eos> Thank you!<eos> I think you look rather fetching without your schnozzle.
Absolutely radishing.<eos> Oh, stop it!<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> Yeah, what's the plan?<eos> It's up to you now, Alice.<eos> Take Time to his castle.<eos> Hatter and I will retrieve the chronosphere... and restore order to the universe.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes, of course, of course!<eos> What are you waiting, for?
I have not ticked my last tock, yet!<eos> It appears... that my invincible machine... is in fact... vincible.<eos> My goodness.<eos> Did I miss anything?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Wilkins?<eos> Yes, sir? Oh! There you are.<eos> Stop standing around.<eos> There is much to do.<eos> You don't need a butler, do you, miss?
One, two, three!<eos> Nice.<eos> Yeah!<eos> He's pretty dead.<eos> He's very dead.<eos> Today my son has become a man. Because of that...<eos> I know you think we're probably doing this to punish you, but we're not. All right?<eos> Your mother and I want the best for you.<eos> You have no idea what she wants.<eos> I don't know why you're doing this.
I'm taking care of you, just like you take care of me.<eos> Am I dreaming?<eos> No.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Is...<eos> When I woke up in the hospital, a week after the accident, you were by my side, waiting on my every need.<eos> But you didn't move. You didn't speak.<eos> No.<eos> And you all assumed I couldn't.
Stephen, this isn't you.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Just shut up. You don't know me.<eos> You're a good boy, Stephen.<eos> No. It was just the accident.<eos> It wasn't an accident!<eos> I didn't care if I died as long as he did.<eos> You're what I...<eos> You...<eos> You were sending me away.
Keys.<eos> Step back.<eos> Shit.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Y'all are new at this, I'm guessing.<eos> Where's the money?<eos> I told you, it's in the safe.<eos> Well, who has the code?<eos> Mr. clauson.<eos> He'll be here soon and I suggest you fellas don't be.
Put your hands on the counter.<eos> On the counter.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> That's it, come on.<eos> That's crazy, y'all ain't even Mexicans.<eos> Uh-uh, uh-uh.<eos> No bundles.<eos> Just loose cash.<eos> Okay.<eos> You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
Indians ain't supposed to feel sorry for cowboys.<eos> It's the other way around.<eos> And this makes you the executor?<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> No matter what they charge us with, they can't take it away.<eos> There's no way to trace funds from a casino.<eos> Once you get the checks to the bank, trust is untouchable.<eos> You can't tell nobody nothing, right?<eos> Well, what is there to tell?<eos> I mean, you boys won that money gambling, didn't you?
That's just so arrogant, it makes my teeth hurt.<eos> To see you boys pay those bastards back with their own money?<eos> Well, if that ain't texan, i don't know what is.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, they can foreclose on Friday.<eos> Come hell or high water, be at the bank in childress on Thursday.<eos> Knowing them fuckers, they will close early.<eos> We'll be there.<eos> Oh, and, Toby, the trust needs to be managed by a bank.<eos> You really wanna cover your tracks?
You okay being with Debbie by yourself?<eos> Remember, he ain't the enemy.<eos> Just take the papers, and say thank you.<eos> The oil man is the enemy, make no mistake.<eos> He just ain't ours.<eos> I'll be back to the ranch by dark.<eos> I will be waiting.<eos> Drive like a schoolteacher with all this shit in the back.<eos> Sure feels like beer o'clock.<eos> Ask and you shall receive.
It's been put in a trust.<eos> What's that mean?<eos> It means no one can sell it.<eos> Great.<eos> Something else i got to take care of.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where's your brother?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Friend's house, i guess.<eos> How come you ain't in school?
Hi.<eos> Where's your brother?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Friend's house, i guess.<eos> How come you ain't in school?<eos> School don't start yet.<eos> Just two-a-days for football right now.<eos> Your grandmother died.<eos> I'm giving the ranch to you and your brother.<eos> Remember going out there when you was little?
School don't start yet.<eos> Just two-a-days for football right now.<eos> Your grandmother died.<eos> I'm giving the ranch to you and your brother.<eos> Remember going out there when you was little?<eos> What am I supposed to do with a ranch?<eos> Anything but sell it.<eos> We found oil on it.<eos> You and your brother ain't gonna have to worry about money no more.<eos> Now, you may be hearing a lot of things about me
Sir, down!<eos> On the ground!<eos> Now!<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Tellers stand up!<eos> Open the drawers!<eos> Get down!<eos> Take three steps back!<eos> Open the fucking drawer, young lady!<eos> Are you deaf and dumb?
- Listen to me, Claire. - Hey, hey, hey, Christian!<eos> - Don't you touch me, Doc!<eos> - Put it down!<eos> - You put it down!<eos> You put it down!<eos> - Christian! Hey! Hey.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Just 'cause you think you should be in charge doesn't make it so. Just... Hey.<eos> You're gonna regret it. All of you!<eos> All of you!
- Put it down!<eos> - You put it down!<eos> You put it down!<eos> - Christian! Hey! Hey.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Just 'cause you think you should be in charge doesn't make it so. Just... Hey.<eos> You're gonna regret it. All of you!<eos> All of you!<eos> I have to get to the Hive.<eos> You have to get these people out of here.
- What about you?<eos> They infected you with the T-virus.<eos> You release this antivirus, it's going to kill you.<eos> - Whatever it takes.<eos> - Alice, I'm not...<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> All right.<eos> We stop Isaacs here, we save these people, and then we go together. We don't have long.<eos> Let's get to it.<eos> What else do you have for defense?
- It's just a six.<eos> - Nasty.<eos> - Disgusting.<eos> I'm sorry, guys.<eos> The botfly larva is a multicellular parasite.<eos> It's fairly easily removed, as you saw.<eos> And you just cover that breathing hole with a piece of tape. Pokes its head up for some air. Pull it out.<eos> Ecuador, 1987.<eos> Pulled that little guy out of my elbow.<eos> Now, I don't know if any of you are following the news.
An innocuous letter... an uppercase "I"... holds the key<eos> - to the fate - hey, are you okay?<eos> The number on the left indicates the number of infected.<eos> The number on the right indicates the members of the household who have been removed.<eos> It's him.<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Girls, listen to me very carefully.<eos> Lock every window and every door in that house.<eos> Nobody in, nobody out.<eos> Do you understand?
Hey, Dad.<eos> Girls, listen to me very carefully.<eos> Lock every window and every door in that house.<eos> Nobody in, nobody out.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Stacey?<eos> I'm here.<eos> Do you remember where my gun is? - Yeah.<eos> - I want you to find it and keep it on you at all times.<eos> Do you understand?
- So, they...<eos> They've asked me to read the sermon.<eos> And your response was...?<eos> This is what I get for speaking in front of Mother.<eos> I told her that I would next read the sermon when Elihu was away.<eos> She...must have told one of the elders.<eos> "Indeed, all parental instructions, unless enforced by becoming examples, "will expose not only the truths taught, "but the parents themselves..."<eos> "Many remained hardened, "thoughtless of God who created them and of Jesus who bled to redeem them."<eos> "Be not deceived, beloved parents.<eos> "If you would train up your children in the way they should go, "you must not merely instruct, "but your actions must corres...
I shall speak if I am asked.<eos> Well, it's your choice.<eos> Are you the rock or are you the plough?<eos> And how long will it be before someone steps forward and asks to hear your wisdom?<eos> (KNOCK AT DOOR) LUCY:<eos> Come in.<eos> - Irving. - Aunt Lucy.<eos> To what do we owe this unexpected visit?<eos> Uh, the pastor of our Baptist church has been called away.<eos> So, Mother and Father were hoping you could speak in his place tomorrow.

I beg You, do not put this burden upon my shoulders!<eos> Send someone else!<eos> (SOBS)<eos> But I made You a promise.<eos> How can I do less now?<eos> Can I deny the only One who has ever truly forgiven me my failings - who has saved me from myself?<eos> (SIGHS) I cannot.<eos> As we know, there is much evidence in Daniel's vision that the cleansing of the sanctuary is symbolic of Christ's return to cleanse our suffering earth, which we have ravaged with war and sullied with sin.<eos> But the proof is strong that Daniel's vision began 457 years before Christ.<eos> Now... ..take 457 from 2,300 and you are left with 1,843 years after Christ, when the vision will be fulfilled.

A shell exploded no further from me than your mother.<eos> I thought, certainly, it was my end.<eos> (IMITATES EXPLOSION)<eos> Aye.<eos> But when the smoke had cleared, I was spared by the power of the loving God.<eos> Did that really happen?<eos> Oh, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, I'm afraid.<eos> Forgive my daughter her impertinence.<eos> It's as true as I sit here before you.<eos> And the next truth you shall hear is that bedtime has come.
Elder Himes and Brother Miller have announced a conference in Boston.<eos> Does Elder Himes know that Papa's sick?<eos> We sent him a letter.<eos> Greetings, friends!<eos> (HIMES LAUGHS)<eos> He cannot travel, Joshua.<eos> He cannot travel!<eos> No. No, no, no.<eos> Of course not. Typhoid is serious.<eos> It's very serious. I know you have both put... great effort into this occasion.
More cities! More printing!<eos> Your words will touch many, many souls.<eos> Please, Joshua, remember, it is not our work - it is God's.<eos> (UPLIFTING MUSIC RISES) Now...might be the time.<eos> Mm.<eos> (WHISPERS) We can't compromise.<eos> The words of Mr Miller and his followers are false.<eos> Those who are seduced by his candied tongue have no place in this house of worship.<eos> So... ..you must, in the name of the Lord, renounce these radical ideas.<eos> If you do not... ..you will not be welcome here, in this house of worship.
Joshua, the world is filled with expectations now.<eos> Not everything follows an exact plan.<eos> I told Brother Bates I would join him.<eos> But... ..he should be at the big tent too!<eos> Whoa, whoa!<eos> I'm looking for Joseph Bates. Do you know where I might find the meeting?<eos> MAN:<eos> Over here. BATES: It is true - 1843 has now passed.<eos> Many of you grow anxious.<eos> You ask why our Saviour has not returned and want to know when will be our blessed hope?
Christ returns in two short weeks.<eos> Prepare your hearts. Oh. Well, tell Him He's buying the next round when He gets here.<eos> I'm sad for those men.<eos> You, sir...<eos> - Sir, please.<eos> - Thank you, my friend. Sir... WILLIAM: "October 6th, 1844.<eos> "Dear Brother Himes, "After much study and prayer, "I see a glory now in the seventh month,<eos> "which I never saw before. "We are almost home.<eos> "Glory, glory, glory."<eos> Come to Jesus Christ, the Lamb that was slain, and now lives, that you may live.
Come to Jesus Christ, the Lamb that was slain, and now lives, that you may live.<eos> Obey His word...and believe.<eos> There is no time for delay. Put it not off, I beg of you.<eos> No.<eos> Not for a moment. Do you not want a house made with hands eternal, in the heavens?<eos> Then "Seek first the Kingdom of Heaven," says Christ, "and then all these things<eos> (STIRRING MUSIC) BOY:<eos> Then damned I will be!<eos> My ship sails tomorrow and my decision is final!<eos> I will not stay here and beg while you stare up at the skies!
I see you're still with us this morning, Hiram.<eos> The chickens, too.<eos> Maybe Jesus will come if you fix Him some breakfast!<eos> (ALL LAUGH)<eos> Is this but a cunningly devised fable, Esther?<eos> Hiram, no. Don't say that.<eos> There is no reality to our fondest hope....<eos> Oh, Hiram...<eos> What are we to do?<eos> Brothers, will you join us to pray for guidance?
I then saw a straight and narrow path far above the dark world.<eos> The Advent people were travelling on a path toward a bright and holy city.<eos> There was a light behind the believers, which the angel told me was the Midnight Cry.<eos> The angel confirmed that Father Miller's message was light, and that this date was the beginning of our journey, not the end.<eos> And all were safe who kept their eyes fixed upon Jesus, who was leading them to the Holy City.<eos> Some grew weary - the city was a great way off, and that they had expected to enter it before now.<eos> But Jesus would encourage them... by raising His right arm, from which came a wondrous light, which poured over the Advent band, and as it did, they shouted, "Hallelujah!"<eos> OTIS: But Brother Sargent, if Miss Harmon's visions are from God...<eos> Her visions do not come from God, Mr Nichols.<eos> But, my friends, how can you be so sure?
Brother Otis, if Almighty God had a message for his people, would he choose to send it in such a frail mouthpiece?<eos> The girl can barely walk.<eos> She stands yea high.<eos> Her father is a hat-maker.<eos> She doesn't come from any kind of ministry background.<eos> Brothers, our Lord Jesus Himself warned us, "Beware of false prophets, "which come to you in sheep's clothing, "but inwardly, they are ravening wolves."<eos> I have heard the visions overtake her, like a trance.<eos> I'm acquainted with a neighbour.<eos> She found her to be credible.<eos> Have either of you seen the young woman? No!
Surely this humble, gentle girl is no child of Satan.<eos> Mr Sargent, Mr Robbins, what a happy surprise.<eos> We thought we might impose upon your generosity and lodge with your family tonight.<eos> I prayed that you might meet Ellen Harmon, and God has answered my prayers.<eos> - The Harmon girl... ..is here?<eos> She arrived a few days ago to share with us.<eos> Uh, Mr Robbins, um... ..we've forgotten to...to visit your sick friend.<eos> Oh, uh, yes!<eos> He is sick. And we had made a previous commitment.<eos> You cannot come in, just for a few moments of introduction?

ETHEREAL VOICE: I am the messenger of God...<eos> Go to Randolph...<eos> Follow the light before you.<eos> Good morning, Ellen.<eos> Did you sleep well?<eos> I... Well...<eos> What is it, dear?<eos> Tell us.<eos> We are so grateful for your hospitality.<eos> I know that you feel that we should go to Boston.
Oh...<eos> SARGENT: Brothers and sisters, our Lord Jesus Himself warned us,<eos> "Beware of false prophets who come in sheep's clothing, "for inwardly, they are ravenous wolves."<eos> Our brother, Otis Nichols, and his wife, Mary, have brought guests.<eos> Ellen Harmon and her sister, Sarah.<eos> I thought you said they wanted us in Boston?<eos> It is clear they do not want us at all.<eos> Well, uh, brothers and sisters, as I was saying, the Lord impresses upon my heart that we should adjourn.<eos> After luncheon, we shall continue to...speak God's Word.<eos> MR THAYER: Before you arrived, they carried on for some time about Miss Harmon.

It is clear that in the final days before Jesus returns, the keeping of the Commandments will become a significant issue.<eos> John, in Revelation, chapter 12, verse 17, describes a people,<eos> "who keep the Commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus."<eos> In the last days, these people are to become the objects of Satan's wrath.<eos> Then chapter 14, verses 6 through 11, John describes God's last warning message to be given to the world before Jesus comes, symbolised by the messages of the three angels.<eos> Verse 12 tells of the people that will take that message to the world -<eos> "Here are they that keep the Commandments of God "and have the faith of Jesus."<eos> It is not one or the other.<eos> Jesus himself says in the Gospel,<eos> "If you love me, keep my Commandments."
We must keep our heads.<eos> So many of the signs of His return that Jesus gave to His disciples in Matthew are being fulfilled around us, today.<eos> Agreed.<eos> And we've made much progress.<eos> Four years ago, who would have imagined worshipping on Saturday?<eos> 'Tis true.<eos> Common ground can be found when we come together.<eos> We keep the Commandments not to BE saved, but because we ARE saved.<eos> Exactly.<eos> As Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my..."

(LAUGHS)<eos> You and Ellen have spent so much time traveling to spread the word, but you cannot be everywhere.
Thank you, Uriah.<eos> You are a blessing to our family.<eos> Before I go, I borrowed some money to get several cakes of maple sugar and two bushels of wheat.<eos> We will pay it all back.<eos> (COUGHS)<eos> Do you want to show Dad the window?<eos> ELLEN: "Little heed is given to the Bible, "and the Lord has given a lesser light to lead men and women "to the greater light - the Bible.<eos> "I do not ask you to take my words.<eos> "Lay Sister White to one side.<eos> "Don't quote my words until you can obey the Bible.
ANDREWS: Gentlemen, under the laws of Michigan, we cannot incorporate our publishing work until we choose a name.<eos> - (OTHERS MUTTER) - MAN: Brother Andrews is right!<eos> MAN: I agree with Brother Andrews.<eos> Gentlemen, let us not back down from what we have spent two days resolving.<eos> This child of ours has been created, and is now so grown that it is exceedingly awkward to have no name for it.<eos> We have been called the people of the shut door... ..because we believe that the door to the Holy Place was closed, and the door to the Most Holy Place in the Heavenly Sanctuary was opened.<eos> Should that be part of our name?<eos> Whatever name we choose... ..it should not be objectionable to the world at large.<eos> We've had two days of discussions.<eos> And, yet, you are no closer?
That fact alone steadies my step.<eos> God's work can truly move forward without hindrance.<eos> The Lord leads and we follow.<eos> But he seemed fine when we left him.<eos> And that was only days ago!<eos> - He WAS fine. Yes.<eos> He... - The doctor says it's pneumonia?<eos> Are you certain?<eos> Mother!<eos> Thank goodness you're both here.
Hands.<eos> Our Heavenly Father, we thank You for blessing us with this nourishment and this delicious meal.<eos> In Your name, we thank You.<eos> Amen.<eos> BOTH: Amen.<eos> Edson, why don't you eat?<eos> Because he's full of all the food he shouldn't be eating.<eos> Now, Willie, stop trying to get your brother in trouble.<eos> Our focus should not be on a list of bad foods.<eos> It is more important that you understand your body is the temple of God, and you must treat it accordingly.

Put the knife down.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Judah.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> He's wounded.<eos> Yes, I can see that.<eos> How?<eos> The cemetery, the romans, take the stones of our ancestors to build their circus.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You're Zealots!

I said get out!<eos> Mother has hopes for a grandchild.<eos> She asks me every day.<eos> I tell her, Soon.<eos> But I know soon isn't soon enough for her.<eos> That sounds wonderful.<eos> Judah Ben-Hur?<eos> Yes?<eos> Follow us.<eos> Where are you taking him?
Zealots.<eos> They poured through the encampment under cover of night.<eos> We had no way of...<eos> The people's gratitude for your bloodless suppression.<eos> What were your men doing here?<eos> Orders were to gather stones to build the circus.<eos> You understand this is sacred land.<eos> These are Judean graves.<eos> I'm informing Pilate.<eos> If you rule as occupiers, you will be met with disaster, I promise.
Mother!<eos> Drag every one of them in here, now!<eos> I have to speak to Messala Severus.<eos> He knows me!<eos> If they resist, kill them.<eos> Come with me!<eos> Please, don't leave them!<eos> Tirzah!<eos> Get down here!<eos> What are you doing?
Search every room!<eos> Messala!<eos> The arrow!<eos> Who shot the arrow?<eos> Who shot the arrow?<eos> Brother don't!<eos> Ah, here's your friend.<eos> Messala?<eos> Messala please help us.<eos> So you don't harbor Zealots.
No water for him!<eos> Someone help us.<eos> Drink.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You would do the same.<eos> Get up, Judah.<eos> Now.<eos> Move.<eos> Judah!<eos> Where are you taking them?
Give me that!<eos> I beg you.<eos> No, please!<eos> Enough!<eos> No, don't.<eos> Take him out.<eos> Don't care.<eos> Just survive.<eos> Forget about them!<eos> For there is no you anymore!
No, don't.<eos> Take him out.<eos> Don't care.<eos> Just survive.<eos> Forget about them!<eos> For there is no you anymore!<eos> This ship is your body.<eos> That drum is your heartbeat!<eos> And your god, is the glory of Rome!<eos> If this ship goes down, so do you.
When they strike, take it.<eos> You can't beat them.<eos> Climb the ladder!<eos> All you can do is outlive them.<eos> We ram! We ram hard!<eos> Reverse with everything we have.<eos> Oars!<eos> Sink them.<eos> Not one Greek will step aboard my ship.<eos> Do you understand me?
Greeks on board!<eos> Reverse!<eos> Reverse!<eos> Reverse on my count!<eos> Help me!<eos> Die!<eos> Hands on! Hands on oar!<eos> Arrows!<eos> Watch the oil!<eos> Keep rowing if you want to live!

You are an escaped prisoner.<eos> To do otherwise would put my camp in jeopardy.<eos> They'll kill me.<eos> I'm sure they will.<eos> We will discharge him outside the garrison, before we leave for Jerusalem.<eos> Jerusalem.<eos> That's where I'm from.<eos> I have family there.<eos> Your private affairs are no concern of mine.<eos> You race chariots?

Aliyah is sick, but that's my dilemma.<eos> No.<eos> She's dying.<eos> I can help her.<eos> I know horses.<eos> I've seen it before.<eos> It's called farcy.<eos> It can be treated with charcoal.<eos> I can help her.<eos> All I ask in return, take me with you.
Wait!<eos> The Torah tells us to...<eos> Wait!<eos> Stop!<eos> Love your neighbor as we love ourselves.<eos> Wait.<eos> Stop! Stop!<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> Hate, anger, fear.<eos> Those are lies they use to turn you against each other.

I'll give 3-to-1 odds on all bets.<eos> My book is open.<eos> That's very generous against a strong field.<eos> I'm not betting the field.<eos> I'm betting that my driver will be victorious over...<eos> Messala.<eos> A bet like that's not customary.<eos> And it's not appropriate.<eos> Not appropriate for who?<eos> All of those citizens who stand to gain when you beat my man?

Seems even.<eos> 3-to-1 not enough?<eos> How about 6-to-1?<eos> With the agreement, that should my driver cross the line first, any and all claims against him are quit.<eos> Any, and all.<eos> Good.<eos> I will leave this with you, until the race is settled.<eos> African!<eos> What's the name of the driver?<eos> You know his name.
Judea.<eos> And the unbeaten,<eos> Rome!<eos> Going to run this.<eos> One time.<eos> Good girl. Good girl.<eos> We pay tribute to Caesar, and give thanks for his virtue and his mercy,<eos> in this circus.<eos> A grand arena, ten years in the making.<eos> You will have the pleasure, for the first time in Judean history.

Stand back! Stand back!<eos> Hurry up! Move!<eos> Out of the way!<eos> Back up!<eos> Get us up there!<eos> Move!<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> Hurry!<eos> I'll kill you!<eos> Are you not Roman?
Not from any of you.<eos> Those who live by the sword, will die by the sword.<eos> Jesus! Jesus!<eos> Dear Lord, please help us!<eos> He's our Savior!<eos> Please let him go!<eos> Please help!<eos> Esther! Esther!<eos> Esther!<eos> You heard him, stand back!
Do you think that's wise?<eos> It's all we have.<eos> This date and place is everything.<eos> We take him to a hospital, it's over.<eos> But if it's between that and him dying?<eos> It's three days.<eos> He'll make it.<eos> I think he's right.<eos> I don't know if there's a way out of all this for y'all, but it's a shame.<eos> You would have made a nice family otherwise.
It is my duty to be here, to share your family's loss.<eos> Our loss.<eos> My father always regarded you as family.<eos> It is not kept hidden.<eos> In his last year, my father wanted it where he could see it.<eos> It reminded him of more noble days.<eos> It bears so many sorrows.<eos> One above all.<eos> Li Mu Bai.<eos> I was his student when you were both here.

If the boy has value to him, he may yet have value to us.<eos> Very well.<eos> Confine him and secure the compound.<eos> What will happen to him?<eos> The boy?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I am called Snow Vase.<eos> I came to pay my respects to Sir Te.<eos> And your concern for the thief?<eos> You mistake curiosity for concern.
I am called Snow Vase.<eos> I came to pay my respects to Sir Te.<eos> And your concern for the thief?<eos> You mistake curiosity for concern.<eos> Is it as powerful as they say?<eos> In the right hand.<eos> Teach me.<eos> You have been well taught already.<eos> I want to learn more.<eos> I want to walk the path you followed.
I don't need a servant, Snow Vase.<eos> My life is solitude, and I return to it shortly.<eos> If you seek a teacher, you must look elsewhere.<eos> Did a night in the cold loosen your tongue?<eos> Open this cage and I'll loosen your teeth.<eos> That's enough!<eos> - What is your name?<eos> - Wei-Fang.<eos> So, Hades Dai wants the sword.<eos> Let me leave with the sword now and you'll be spared.
That was your choice, and you made it for all of us.<eos> I have made peace with your passing, and so it will remain.<eos> You are needed and you're here.<eos> Your skill and courage are not forgotten.<eos> All else is.<eos> And you are?<eos> Snow Vase.<eos> Student of Master Yu Shu Lien.<eos> I have not known her to take a student.<eos> So you know her well.
That is our story, yours and mine.<eos> Wait.<eos> Come back!<eos> This is for Shi!<eos> And this is for Ma!<eos> Stop!<eos> - He is one of them!<eos> - She's right!<eos> This is not our way.<eos> If you're going to fight, fight like men.
Stop!<eos> - He is one of them!<eos> - She's right!<eos> This is not our way.<eos> If you're going to fight, fight like men.<eos> Enough!<eos> Someone taught you well.<eos> Not well enough.<eos> Come in.<eos> You're leaving.

I would not burden you with that knowledge.<eos> Too many will hunt it.<eos> - Can I go with you?<eos> - No.<eos> I must make this journey alone.<eos> What about Silent Wolf?<eos> Will he go?<eos> Why should he?<eos> I see the way you are together.<eos> Is it that you don't trust him anymore?
- No.<eos> I must make this journey alone.<eos> What about Silent Wolf?<eos> Will he go?<eos> Why should he?<eos> I see the way you are together.<eos> Is it that you don't trust him anymore?<eos> You speak of trust?<eos> You, whose teacher who was Han Mei.<eos> You always knew?

I mourn for his son.<eos> Tonight... I leave with the sword.<eos> And Silent Wolf?<eos> Will you speak with him?
I have the abronath.<eos> Secure the ship.<eos> Krall, the ship is turning back!<eos> Cut its throat.<eos> We're searching for the captain.<eos> We searched the wreckage.<eos> He must have hidden it elsewhere.<eos> All we have is his crew, krall.<eos> Let me deal with them.<eos> You've brought us this far.
- What?<eos> You think she's a fox?<eos> I think she's... interesting.<eos> - She's not even human, man.<eos> - Alright.<eos> 5 letters, "Most inferior".<eos> - Goodwin.<eos> - That's not five.<eos> Yeah, but it is fucking true.<eos> Damn, did you see those things up close?
Mills.<eos> Those were our positions.<eos> Robinson, cover me!<eos> Keep moving!<eos> Captain, do you copy? Over.<eos> We got to get somewhere where we can get eyes on.<eos> I can't get a good shot from here.<eos> Captain?<eos> Captain, do you read me? Copy.<eos> Anyone, this is Cutbill, do you read me?
Woman wears some big stockings.<eos> Got them crazy big legs, and hips wide as the Mississippi River.<eos> Legs don't mean nothing.<eos> You don't do nothing but push 'em out of the way.<eos> But them hips,<eos> - they cushion the ride.<eos> - Troy, you ain't got no sense!<eos> It's the truth.<eos> Like you riding on Goodyears!<eos> What you all out here getting into?

I got the coffee on. That's all right.<eos> I just have some of that this morning.<eos> That 651 hit yesterday.<eos> That's the second time this month Miss Pearl hit for a dollar.<eos> Seems like those that need the least always get lucky.<eos> Poor folks can't get nothing.<eos> Them numbers don't know nobody.<eos> I don't know why you fool with 'em, you and Lyons both.<eos> It's something to do.<eos> You ain't doing nothing but throwing your money away.
He's alive, he's healthy.<eos> He's got to make his own way.<eos> I made mine.<eos> Ain't nobody gonna hold his hand when he get out there in the world.<eos> Times have changed, Troy.<eos> People change.<eos> The world changing, and you can't even see it.<eos> Woman, I do the best I can do.<eos> I come in here every Friday, I carry a sack of potatoes and a bucket of lard.<eos> You all line up at the door with your hands out.
Wait a minute, you ain't walked no 200 miles, Pop.<eos> Ain't nobody gonna walk no 200 miles.<eos> You talking about some walking there!<eos> That's the only way you got anywhere back in them days.<eos> Shit!<eos> Damn if I wouldn't have hitched a ride with somebody.<eos> Who you gonna hitch it with?<eos> There ain't no cars and things like they got now.<eos> We talking about 1918.<eos> What you all out here gettin' into?
That's your daddy you talking about!<eos> I don't want to hear that kind of talk this morning.<eos> I done raised you to come to this?<eos> You standing there all healthy and grown, talking about you ain't going to your daddy's funeral?<eos> - Mama, listen...<eos> - I don't want to hear it, Cory!<eos> Just get that thought out of your head.<eos> I've got to say no to him. One time in my life, I got to say no.<eos> I don't got to listen to that!<eos> Now, I know you and your daddy ain't seen eye to eye, but I don't have to listen to that kind of talk this morning.
All the way to the hotel.<eos> This is going to go very wrong. You know that?<eos> No, this is going to be brilliant!<eos> - (LOU WHOOPS)<eos> - WILL:<eos> Oh...<eos> I don't think you're driving in a straight line!<eos> (LOU CONTINUES WHOOPING)<eos> CAMILLA:<eos> Why didn't you return any of my calls?
(WOMAN SPEAKS FRENCH)<eos> (CABIN DOOR CLOSES)<eos> Oh, look at you.<eos> - You look wonderful!<eos> - You do.<eos> Great photos of you on the beach. Swimming, too?<eos> Yeah, it was great.<eos> How was the flight?<eos> Well, we got here in one piece.<eos> Are you hungry?
Hot-shot here defragged it.<eos> Your boy ed knows his stuff.<eos> Glad to hear it. Good man, ed.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come on, Andy, smile.<eos> Come on now, there you go, Andy.<eos> Yeah, really.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let me show you this.<eos> All right, let's see what you're looking at here.
Hey.<eos> - Katie!<eos> - You gotta be kidding me.<eos> - Do not make a scene.<eos> Wow, they're playing great, huh?<eos> Right?<eos> What are you doing here, ed?<eos> Oh, Kaitlyn asked me online.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What, you two are talking together online?
Oh, Kaitlyn asked me online.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What, you two are talking together online?<eos> Yeah, yeah. She just said, "come see my team play."<eos> Here I am.<eos> Yeah!<eos> You're getting very good at this, sweetheart.<eos> You really are, honey.<eos> - Kaitlyn: Thank you.<eos> Hey, you guys did great out there.
Sure, why not?<eos> Text me later.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye, later, friend-o.<eos> So, was that guy your boyfriend?<eos> Sort of.<eos> Uh huh.<eos> He seems a little immature for you.<eos> We grew up together, so... We're mostly just friends.<eos> So you haven't had sex yet?
- Look...<eos> Look, just change everything, the pass codes, the words.<eos> Do what you guys do.<eos> Secure this place.<eos> - Get it done, please!<eos> - Okay, Mike. Let's go, guys.<eos> All right, quiet, everybody!<eos> Come on, kids.<eos> Stay together.<eos> Make sure you've got everything!
I love you!<eos> Thank you. I love you, too.<eos> My name is Michelle Darnell and I am the 47th wealthiest woman in America.<eos> How wealthy am I?<eos> I had Destiny's Child reunite only to have them come over to my personal living room so I could watch them break apart again.<eos> How did I get to my success level?<eos> What's my secret?<eos> I worked myself silly.<eos> Okay, number one.<eos> You work your ass off to get what you want.

This is...<eos> This is not reasonable.<eos> Claire!<eos> Don't fight it, Michelle!<eos> Let me go!<eos> Ooh. Don't struggle, baby!<eos> Renault ratted me out!<eos> It's just insider trading!<eos> Everybody does it!<eos> You are fighting with the wrong redhead!
Horrible, horrible feedback from everybody.<eos> So, thank you for the groveling.<eos> Good bye!<eos> Fuck off, Bryce.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> You wouldn't even be here if I hadn't brought you in as a junior executive.<eos> And, Terri, you think anybody else would've hired you right out of college?<eos> No!<eos> I don't who the fuck you three are.

I bet you got here climbing on my back somehow.
Go to hell!<eos> When I get to hell, I'll tell Pam that you said hello, 'cause she's probably down there fucking IT guys.<eos> Weird little guys, carrying wires around in weird hats.<eos> That's who she's fucking in hell.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't need you.<eos> I don't need you and you're gonna be sorry.<eos> 'Cause I got a sweet deal for you and you're letting it walk out.<eos> You know, you want to be dumbasses? Be my guest.<eos> I'll tell you what, you're gonna regret this.
Let me introduce you to my new golden goose...<eos> Darnell's Darlings.<eos> Stalin.<eos> Okay.<eos> Communist youth.<eos> All right!<eos> Japanese-y black power?<eos> My takeaway from that is "powerful."<eos> Powerful imagery and I'll take that any day of the week.<eos> Why are you up?
Oh. Can I be honest?<eos> That cat probably killed himself because his name was "Spaghetti." Right?<eos> Hey-oh!<eos> - Michelle. - Oh...<eos> All right, okay.<eos> Why don't you take off, Sandy?<eos> It's my meeting and I'm... Okay.<eos> Go catch it. Go catch it.<eos> Really sorry about your loss.<eos> As you already know, my name is Michelle Darnell and this is my partner.
Let's...<eos> And I got a hunch that your mom should've stuck with it. She wouldn't be so pent-up and angry.<eos> That's my hunch.<eos> Let's change the subject.<eos> We brought you guys some delicious homemade brownie treats.<eos> Ooh. Look at this!<eos> We brought treats, everybody!<eos> Treats!<eos> Let me ask you one question.<eos> When you sell a box of cookies, what do you get?
That's my hunch.<eos> Let's change the subject.<eos> We brought you guys some delicious homemade brownie treats.<eos> Ooh. Look at this!<eos> We brought treats, everybody!<eos> Treats!<eos> Let me ask you one question.<eos> When you sell a box of cookies, what do you get?<eos> You get points that can apply to your canoe trip.<eos> Wrong, you get a big plate of bullshit!
We think if you go out and sell a box of cookies, we should give you 5% commission.<eos> 5% commission, every box you sell.<eos> It was supposed to be 10%, I think.<eos> That's right, we did say that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So far, you suck at this.<eos> Just letting you know that.<eos> Okay, it's 10%.<eos> You come work with us, you get a share of the profits.<eos> Okay. Or you can stay here! Be my guest and, I don't know, build some dirty badger nests in some kind of tree.
My God!<eos> And I was making that up.<eos> I was trying to think of the worst possible scenario on Earth.<eos> What the hell is going on in here?<eos> I leave the room for one minute to talk to my landscaper and the meeting goes into the toilet?<eos> Sorry, Helen, we're almost done.<eos> Okay, you guys, the best part about Darnell's Darlings is that, for each box sold, an extra 10% will go into a college fund for you.<eos> Okay?<eos> We are gonna help you save for your college education.<eos> Wait, are you trying to poach girls from a Dandelions meeting?
Hello, Bonnie!<eos> Look at this.<eos> Patrice, take that.<eos> Take that and buy me something!<eos> I'm just kidding, but if you want to...<eos> Remember, girls, when the houses are nice, we double the price.<eos> Rich people don't trust affordable snacks.<eos> - You know what?<eos> Let's go up to $10 a box. - Hey!<eos> What do you think you're doing?
- You know what?<eos> Let's go up to $10 a box. - Hey!<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> Hi, Helen!<eos> We're participating in the American Dream.<eos> Not on this street, you're not.<eos> This is Dandelion territory.<eos> It's okay, Helen, we'll just... Shut up, Sandy!<eos> Okay.<eos> You guys are losers!
It's okay, Helen, we'll just... Shut up, Sandy!<eos> Okay.<eos> You guys are losers!<eos> Hey, suck my dick, Gigantor!<eos> You're fucking dead!<eos> Hannah, stop it!<eos> We are not gonna behave like this!<eos> Michelle. A word?<eos> I'd be delighted.<eos> First rule of business, pretend to negotiate and then take what you want.
Strange girl.<eos> Okay.<eos> Claire, if this company is going to work, I need you full time.<eos> I can't have you here.<eos> Are you in or are you out?<eos> I can't just leave my job!<eos> I mean, I have to have a steady income.<eos> I have Rachel to think about.<eos> No, no, no. This is for Rachel. Okay?<eos> If this works out the way I know it's going to work out, it's gonna set you two up for life.
You need to...<eos> Look, just take 'em a little bit lower.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How about that?<eos> I paid a fortune for these.<eos> No, I'm gonna bring 'em...<eos> I'm keepin' 'em up!<eos> Just gonna push 'em right down.<eos> I'm trying to help you not...<eos> What're you guys doing?
I made the frame at school.<eos> It's a nice frame, Rachel.<eos> You did a good job.<eos> Thanks.<eos> When I look at the picture, I just think we're like a weird family.<eos> Okay. Ah.<eos> Family?<eos> That's a little heavy-handed.<eos> I think, you know, I'm not much into labeling.<eos> You say "family", and we don't look alike. I mean, I'm not even sure that you two look alike.
And we all have our little secrets, Claire. Right?<eos> You double-crossing, hand-holding, sneaky little rat!<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> God, I can't believe I helped you!<eos> I took you in off the street, okay?<eos> When no one else would.<eos> You are such a cliché.<eos> You're getting close to people so now you have to push them away.<eos> Okay, don't analyze me, Dr. Phil!<eos> Why're you guys doing this?
I know what I'm gonna do.<eos> I'm gonna sue the pants off her. Oh...<eos> No, I'm not because she'll throw too many lawyers at me and she's a shark in court.<eos> Yeah. This is a test.<eos> You want me to kill her with this bagel knife.<eos> And I'll do it.<eos> To pledge my allegiance to you, milady, I'll do it.<eos> No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ooh, you guys are kissing.
- Holy shit!<eos> - Language!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> This is all seeming probably so much stranger than what I had intended.<eos> I'm sorry to startle you, Rachel.<eos> What are you doing in my closet?<eos> Well, uh, to give you the whole...<eos> I thought I have a great idea to surprise you with an apology, and my sincere "I'm sorry."<eos> So I let myself in, in the middle of the night.<eos> So once I was actually waiting here in the dark, and you were getting up for the morning, I thought, "Uh-oh.
Okay.<eos> I apologized.<eos> I heard you.<eos> There's the door.<eos> You sold us out.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> I sold you out.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> And I'm hoping, somehow, you can forgive me.
That's a mix-up, huh?<eos> Michelle, I would never in a million years do that to you, okay?<eos> You know...<eos> I mean, God. What goes on in your brain?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I don't have a lot of, you know, experience or a reference point for...<eos> I didn't have a family, or a mom, or a dad.<eos> And I totally get it if you never talk to me again.<eos> So I don't want you to feel bad about that.<eos> I just wanted you to know that I think you're very nice people.
He leaves no digital trail.<eos> Claire knows this.<eos> He's all old-school pen and paper.<eos> It's the samurai way.<eos> Okay, I'm in.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Why would you be in?<eos> What do you mean why would I be in?<eos> You've been talking all morning about how you wanted to get your company back. And you guys are gonna need help, and I'm a helpful guy.
But I am sorry.<eos> So, I'm not...<eos> And I will rectify...<eos> Michelle!<eos> You will be. You will be.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wonder, how should I approach this?<eos> Call the proper authorities and turn you in?<eos> Or we could just talk it out amongst ourselves.<eos> Do you know what the fascinating thing is about the Japanese martial arts?
You know what I'm gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna cut you into string, ball you up, and then bat you around for hours in a game that only I understand.<eos> Oh, very nice.<eos> I'll take that!<eos> You want to start with me, little raisin?<eos> Okay.<eos> Get your umbrellas out, kitties, because here they come!<eos> The thunder and the lightning!<eos> Right down on your face!<eos> Gosh, there are a lot of you up there.
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!<eos> Who are you guys?<eos> Huh? Who are we? Who are we?<eos> We are the Flushed Pets...<eos> Thrown away by our owners and now we are out for revenge!<eos> It's like a club, but with biting and scratching.<eos> Take us with you!<eos> I don't think so, pets.<eos> Yeah, you got the stench of domestication all over you.<eos> You chose your side.

I don't think so, pets.<eos> Yeah, you got the stench of domestication all over you.<eos> You chose your side.<eos> And now you're gonna burn.<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> Who you calling "pets"?<eos> I ain't no pet!<eos> You got it all wrong!<eos> We're just like you guys.
Because I just killed the one.<eos> Oh, y'all cold-blooded.<eos> Oh, man, you remind me of my boy, Ricky.<eos> He died, though.<eos> RIP, Ricky!<eos> The truth is, the struggle could use some more muscle.<eos> All right, look, I'll tell you what.<eos> We'll bust the both of you out of here.<eos> But understand this.<eos> From now on, you work for me.
The leader does not recite the password.<eos> The leader makes up the password, idiots.<eos> Everybody, I'm making up a new password right now.<eos> The new password is...<eos> "Don't ask the leader for the password!"<eos> Follow me.<eos> Welcome to the underbelly, brothers.<eos> Home of the Flushed Pets.<eos> Brothers and sisters!<eos> As you see, I've returned from the surface with two new recruits.

Settle down!<eos> Guys, I want you to tell them how you did it.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Tell them the whole story about how you took out your owner.
Tell us!<eos> Right.<eos> So, tell them, Max.<eos> Okay, so.<eos> I was like...<eos> Well, we were like...<eos> Take that!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Stupid owner.<eos> So, that's who you're dealing with.
I do!<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> Okay. Uh, well...<eos> We used the spoon...<eos> Hit a button on the machine on the counter...<eos> Right, and it's got those... The, uh, you know.<eos> Those blades.<eos> The, uh... It's got blades!<eos> Was it a blender?<eos> You blended somebody?
From his life!<eos> I lived in a tattoo parlor!<eos> The trainees used to practice on me!<eos> Until they ran out of space!<eos> I mean, yes, humans say they love us.<eos> But then they turn around and throw us out like garbage.<eos> Ain't that right, Sea-Monkeys?<eos> It's not our fault we don't look like the ad!<eos> Yeah!<eos> All right, you guys are joining the brotherhood.
No, no, no, no.<eos> Stop!<eos> What are you doing initiating a couple domestics?<eos> Domestics?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We just jumped those two in the alley.<eos> Slashed off their collars.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> That's not true.<eos> You said you burned your collars.
Domestics?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We just jumped those two in the alley.<eos> Slashed off their collars.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> That's not true.<eos> You said you burned your collars.<eos> Well, "burned," "lost," "had them stolen by cats."<eos> It's all just words, really, isn't it?<eos> You don't deserve to be marked by the Viper.

100% wrong.<eos> Good enough.<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Move it or lose it!<eos> Every bird instinct I have says don't follow a dog on wheels.<eos> Um, Mr. Pops, sir.<eos> Shouldn't we be heading to the sewers?<eos> Now, if we take the human route, getting there is gonna take days.<eos> You may have lots of time, but for me every breath is a cliffhanger.
Where's the Viper at?<eos> Don't you worry, Viper!<eos> You will not be forgotten!<eos> You will be avenged, Viper!<eos> If you don't believe me, you can look at my battle plans.<eos> It's all laid out right here.<eos> Uh, boss...<eos> I can't tell who anyone is.<eos> Well, you gotta really look at it to understand it.<eos> That's you guys right here.
It's all laid out right here.<eos> Uh, boss...<eos> I can't tell who anyone is.<eos> Well, you gotta really look at it to understand it.<eos> That's you guys right here.<eos> And, see, that's Brooklyn.<eos> That's where we gonna get them dogs.<eos> That ball of fluff's got a screw loose.<eos> Let's skedaddle.<eos> You get it, you see what I'm saying.
I mean, he's probably worried sick!<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, I do know and we're going!<eos> Your owner's gonna freak!<eos> I'm freaking out just thinking about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's do it!<eos> There they are!<eos> All right, doggy, come on.<eos> Where do you think you're going?
Start hanging out with him.<eos> After a while, you'll think it's him you'll be done.<eos> We are not just giving up!<eos> We're dedicated. We're loyal.<eos> We're easily the greatest pet ever.<eos> We're dogs!<eos> Cat.<eos> Hawk.<eos> Well, congratulations!<eos> Today you're dogs, whether you like it or not!
I just wanted to...<eos> Look...<eos> Have you ever lived across from someone your whole life, but you don't really appreciate them, until...<eos> I don't know...<eos> Until they're beating up dozens of animals on the Brooklyn Bridge?<eos> I guess what I'm trying to say is...<eos> If you ever wanna...<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> You're in love.
So do I.<eos> Thank you for your concern.<eos> I'll be in touch if I find that book.<eos> You shouldn't be up this late.<eos> Neither should you.<eos> No doubt you had a couple of scotches with Jon?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's exactly what I did.<eos> We needed to let off some steam.<eos> Where did you go? Some dive.
And just because you say it's true, doesn't mean it is.<eos> But, I'm headed out there right now.<eos> I'll let you all know if I see anything big and green and breathing fire.<eos> Mr. Meacham, I believe you.<eos> Well, I'm glad you do.<eos> See, my daughter, she knows a thing or two but only if it's staring at her in the face.<eos> If you go through life only seeing what's right in front of you you're gonna miss out on a whole lot.<eos> See, and that's where you guys have the upper hand.<eos> Because mark my words that dragon is still out there.<eos> And if you were to go out there to those woods where no one ever goes,

You ready to go, Grace?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just a second.<eos> Come on, Grace.<eos> Not again.<eos> I'm just settling a score.<eos> One for Jack. One for you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Something like that.<eos> Aren't you two supposed to be getting hitched?
Hey, Gavin.<eos> Did Jack give the okay to cut this deep?<eos> Don't worry about Jack.<eos> Just keep cutting.<eos> Who said it was okay to be here?<eos> I just go where they tell me.<eos> Where's Jack?<eos> There he is!<eos> This is so out of line, Jack.<eos> You're not supposed to be cutting anywhere near this deep.
Hold on.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Hold on. Hold on.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> Come check this out.<eos> Fresh.<eos> Not even a day old.<eos> What do you think?
Start the truck!<eos> Where's Gavin?<eos> Come on, man!<eos> Wait!<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> What is that?<eos> Gavin, come on!<eos> What was that?<eos> What was that?<eos> Did you see that?
Where's Gavin?<eos> Come on, man!<eos> Wait!<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> What is that?<eos> Gavin, come on!<eos> What was that?<eos> What was that?<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Did you see that?
I quit that.<eos> But maybe... maybe can you just be open to... looking.<eos> I know those woods.<eos> I know those woods like the back of my hand.<eos> I couldn't have missed a dragon.<eos> Well, you missed Pete.<eos> Wake up, honey.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You heading out already?
If he wakes up, he could take out the whole town and everyone in it.<eos> Jack, he's a monster.<eos> It's not a monster.<eos> It's an animal.<eos> And it's hurt and it's scared.<eos> Grace, wait.<eos> You need help.<eos> You need Pete.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Did you just see that?
What's going on in there?<eos> Now, I gotta warn you.<eos> This thing is dangerous.<eos> Me and my crew are the only ones who know how to deal with it.<eos> So, when you get in there, just stay calm.<eos> Don't startle it.<eos> Don't want anyone getting eaten on my watch.<eos> Gavin, wait.<eos> Listen, Grace, we're not in the forest anymore, so what's in there<eos> You can sit out here and talk about what's in there until you're blue in the face.
Trees growed taller.<eos> Tales growed taller, too.<eos> By and by, even the best ones come to an end.<eos> But I know someone, who would tell you otherwise.<eos> There's one little boy who could tell you the whole story.<eos> He could even tell you what happens next.<eos> He knows that the North Star shines brightest of all.<eos> He knows that there's magic in the woods, if you know where to look for it.<eos> He knows his dragon is still out there.<eos> And maybe, if you're lucky, that same boy, the bravest boy I've ever met,

Shit.<eos> What is going to shit music?<eos> - What's going on there?<eos> - Stay where you are.<eos> Ok, now fast.<eos> Ok, one, two, three.<eos> Please, God, let me get away on a technicality.<eos> For a woman who is damn hard.<eos> The weighs more than a weekend shopping trip.<eos> - Hey, Limus, Leonard, what are you doing?
- If it was that I did not ...?<eos> - This is my house!<eos> Oscillating immediately your ass here!<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Dance Party.<eos> - Hey, Dad.<eos> - Do not dance.<eos> Stop it.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - What are you doing this evening?

Well, this time you've really broken it, dude.<eos> I do not know what happened.<eos> - No she is not really.<eos> - Alive?<eos> Was?<eos> This is a doll.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Huffy, she's a fucking robot.<eos> Today I am slightly hungover.<eos> And you are stupid.

Listen, I'm not a bad person.<eos> I do not kill like.<eos> Sometimes, all it, sure, but usually it is to me.<eos> I want to ...<eos> I do not want to kill you.<eos> So we avoid it, and her Finds them, please. Find them.<eos> I, Senator.<eos> I.<eos> I mean, this meeting is over.<eos> What do you all mean?
This is a real caveman.<eos> Ok?<eos> Is similar to Peter the Great, which I showed you earlier.<eos> As the scope is different.<eos> And as I also have a pair of adjustable testicles.<eos> The tails can be separated.<eos> - Crap.<eos> - Oh my goodness.<eos> - Yes.<eos> So you can also ...
Oh, wow, Alter.<eos> - OK.<eos> Oh no ...<eos> - Get off me!<eos> We found that what you want to see safe.<eos> - We do not come without reason.<eos> - This will blow your mind.<eos> Ok, I understand that correctly?<eos> Your they have run over ...<eos> You have brought them to you and the only thing she wanted was to fuck you immediately.
Somehow you have this thing can turn yet.<eos> Wi-Fi.<eos> Wi-Fi.<eos> Of course, Wi-Fi.<eos> Wi-Fi, cool!<eos> Congratulation.<eos> You guys are the proud owners an ultramodern fucking machine with all the extras.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> A King Snake Love!<eos> I hope you read like, because the sweetness has its own Bible here.
That it is essential to have read.<eos> The Bible is God's cookbook.<eos> In it he gives the recipes for life.<eos> What recipes?<eos> For example, I cook for no man before he infects me a ring.<eos> Brother, do not pull me by the hair.<eos> - Even when beating rules.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Where is the bot?<eos> - No idea what you're talking.

Hey, this is Benny.<eos> - Benny!<eos> - Benny!<eos> - They want their property back, all right?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> The FBI has raped me orally, because they thought I would Bardot.<eos> No one is behind Bardot here, you dumbass.<eos> I mean damn serious!<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I told them that you have it, So skin from dear, if you want to keep them.
- Let's go.<eos> - OK.<eos> Cool, man.<eos> Who was that?<eos> What did these men?<eos> They want you.<eos> Me?<eos> How so?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Do you want me as the same reasons as those men?
Caroline, you will rewrite this shit before my appearance, ok?<eos> We will...<eos> Hey!<eos> There they are.<eos> Look at me, who comes there.<eos> All right.<eos> The Limited in Black.<eos> Says nothing.<eos> Three days.<eos> Can you then do not do anything right?

Out there must be 40 people, damn.<eos> Hey, my kung fu style is only enough for a dozen guys at once.<eos> We have no chance.<eos> - Then we'll die here together.<eos> - You would die for me?<eos> Huffy, honest, I admire your Bonnie and Clyde attitude, but it sounds totally stupid, if you say what that.<eos> I am bold and she is beautiful.<eos> And they will not get them.<eos> Yes, hi, guys.<eos> So, we know that you are in there.
Original.<eos> - We do not give you! - OK.<eos> All right.<eos> Relax yourself.<eos> Hey, motherfucker, I'll tell you how it's run.<eos> He wants to talk to you.<eos> He wants to order something.<eos> Hello?<eos> Three large ice cream cones or three cans of coke ...<eos> - Do you want a pizza?
No no no.<eos> And.<eos> How long does it take for to get Coke and pizza, motherfucker?<eos> OK?<eos> Nonsense!<eos> It's ultimately not about caviar and filet mignon.<eos> It is enough!<eos> I have enough!<eos> I'm really pissed off.<eos> Do you know what the plan?
Do you know what the plan?<eos> They want us to fumigate.<eos> The hold out until we give up.<eos> No no no!<eos> Mach spoon with Huff.<eos> I ran go.<eos> Your "caviar and filet mignon" was a clear statement.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Listen to.<eos> You come out now and bring you your ice, or I will send in two minutes all my men purely and we cut yourselves from your tails!
You come out now and bring you your ice, or I will send in two minutes all my men purely and we cut yourselves from your tails!<eos> Forever!<eos> We should bring us our ice cream.<eos> Pretty good.<eos> - And?<eos> - And.<eos> The streusel are delicious.<eos> Hirnfrost.<eos> I do not want to go through again.<eos> - Did you get it the plan?
- Why?<eos> - I do not know, but how about that?<eos> I do for you on, because if Dick sees that you frittierst tears you know how this ends.<eos> Show yourself, you bum!<eos> Your sick little assholes!<eos> - What shoud that?<eos> - Yes exactly.<eos> She's mine now.<eos> What have you done with her?<eos> Everything you could not.

Now, if the stock of your son in the mud from my stirs ...<eos> - I find a fist not so bad.<eos> - I have to agree with you.<eos> - What?<eos> - I think we all should looking forward to the love of our children fit.<eos> - Jeez!<eos> - Such expressions<eos> - I will not tolerate.<eos> - Yes I agree with you.<eos> I mean, if you want to keep both hands, that's ok.
We want you but only support ok?<eos> I do not even care Limus that you were in my closet have taken and clothes.<eos> Probably you are wearing it and verkleidest you as a woman.<eos> No, it is not.<eos> Oh son, you play about the woman?<eos> No, I ...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Dad stop, please googling on and think you knew everything.<eos> Mom, I know your support estimate, but you really lie so what from wrong.<eos> You there, you are our stupid parents!
You there, you are our stupid parents!<eos> And this head-to-head thing when you were a boy is damn strange, ok?<eos> We're just best friends, who want to depend, and a couple of assholes want us to the leather.<eos> So spared us with this shit!<eos> I would note that I see it that way.<eos> - That was fucked up.<eos> - That was brutal.<eos> Really cool!<eos> Say goodbye to one another.<eos> You will not see for a while.
- Crap.<eos> - Let's talk tomorrow?<eos> - I ...<eos> I'll send you a text message.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Small software damage and a few cosmetic repairs.<eos> Suffers they?<eos> I do not suffer.<eos> Wipe it off.<eos> Do you not hear?
Los, run!<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go, come.<eos> Run!<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Cover your eyes.<eos> That is not very nice.<eos> Abartig and great at the same time.<eos> I have no idea where we're going and what we do next.<eos> - You?
- Anyone?<eos> Very well.<eos> Commence deplanetization!<eos> Ready the Deplanetizer!<eos> Seriously?<eos> 496, 497, 498, 499, 500.<eos> Come on.<eos> Is that all you got? I need you to give me 2,000,010%.<eos> One and two and three and four.<eos> Remember, if you feel the burn, that's good.

You are a great friend, Grim.<eos> Don't let anyone tell you different.<eos> I'll be back before you know it!<eos> You're the best boss in the galaxy! An inspiration to us all!<eos> Don't ever change!<eos> I'm okay!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, get on your feet, put your hands together, and give a big Planet Veldin welcome to your Galactic Rangers!<eos> First up, she'll shoot first and ask questions when she's good and ready.<eos> Cora Veralux!<eos> You loved him in Grapplemania, you'll love him more as a Galactic Ranger.
Hello, Captain!<eos> He's on fire again. I know.<eos> My name is Copernicus Qwark, and yes, that was an impressive wall of fire I just walked past.<eos> I'm going to be real with you folks for a moment.<eos> When President Phyronix recommended I take on a new ranger, I knew just where to go.<eos> That's right, we want you!<eos> Yeah!<eos> The galaxy is a perilous place.<eos> Invasion, space pirates, supernovas!<eos> I know what you're thinking, "Do I have what it takes?"

You're getting this, right?<eos> Two civilians are saving the city!<eos> There are 300 heavily armed warbots gaining on us! I know! Isn't it great?<eos> Get ready to return to sender!<eos> Terminating mag-booster on my mark!<eos> Three, two, one... Mark!<eos> No, no...<eos> No!<eos> What happened?<eos> You got to be kidding me!
A sad simpleton who'd believe whatever we tell him.<eos> A corruptible moron.<eos> But who?<eos> Who?<eos> Who?<eos> I'm getting an idea, boys!<eos> You're a genius, sir.<eos> I know. I know!<eos> Our training program usually lasts a full year, but we've been cleared to attack Drek Industries in three days.<eos> That means you two are getting the accelerated course.
All right, Rangers, our plan of attack is simple.<eos> HALO drop into Skorg City, fire a whole mess o' bullets, and take Drek into custody so we can be home in time for waffles.<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Yeah, waffles!<eos> Oh, that's good.<eos> Wait, that's our plan?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Pardon me, Captain, but Chairman Drek is cunning. He will be prepared for our assault.<eos> Look, I think it is beyond adorable that you decided to do all this homework. But big heroes do big things.
I'm sorry, but you're the only one who's been inside Drek's warbot factory.<eos> Besides, this is the best way for you to keep up.<eos> Whoa! Nice backpack.<eos> Remember, your thrusters are powered by Ratchet's suit, so don't try any solo flights.<eos> Okay?<eos> I shall endeavor to...<eos> He's in good hands, Elaris.<eos> You sure you want to take the, uh, extra baggage?<eos> No offense, but we're dropping straight into a cauldron.<eos> And do you know what's inside that cauldron?
My cadet photo.<eos> Really? That's how we're playing?<eos> Okay, uh, there's no need to embarrass anyone here.<eos> Okay, everyone, chill out!<eos> We have a job to do, and I need to start shooting at something immediately.<eos> Well, before we just go off and start shooting at things, I was thinking that...<eos> Yeah, get some. That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Forget it.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Go on. I think we need to hear what you both have to say.
Use that, whatever that's called. That's good. Okay.<eos> Right.<eos> Over here. Keep bringing it on in, ratcheting it on up, electrifying everything.<eos> Make sure everything's got electricity running through it, at least a little bit.<eos> That's good, too.<eos> Whatever that is, you're doing great. Okay.<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> Get in here now!<eos> Uh, please.<eos> You're not going to believe this. We finally decoded the Deplanetizer plans.
I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know how things got this far.<eos> This is just pathetic!<eos> Nefarious.<eos> Give it up. It's over.<eos> As head of the Galactic Rangers, uh, he's here to place you under arrest. Me?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Arrest this man for his speakable crimes against the galaxy.<eos> My crimes?<eos> The real crime is how you treated me!
Get off me, you has-been!<eos> You know, maybe Drek was right.<eos> I am a mad scientist.<eos> Whoo-hoo!<eos> They missed!<eos> Lousy, insolent, idiotic...<eos> Break off.<eos> Break off!<eos> Copy that.<eos> Ratchet, you have to get out of there now!
Lousy, insolent, idiotic...<eos> Break off.<eos> Break off!<eos> Copy that.<eos> Ratchet, you have to get out of there now!<eos> Weapon locker depleted. Hmm.<eos> Yeah. We're working on it.<eos> No!<eos> My plan!<eos> You've ruined my plan!
There's nothing we can do.<eos> We must find one of Drek's teleporters!<eos> - I saw one on the bridge!<eos> - Watch out!<eos> Hang on, boys.<eos> It's here! Hit the brakes!<eos> Relax, I know what...<eos> - Qwark!<eos> - Oh, no. I can't reach you in time.<eos> Just get out while you can!
Believe me, the minute somebody tries to blow up another planet, I'll be ready to go.<eos> But, hey, what are the odds of that happening?<eos> Precisely 87,534 to one.<eos> Yep. A real wild one.<eos> No!<eos> Get away from me! Do not stick that thing in...<eos> Oh! Oh! Oh!<eos> Quit trying to repair me, you moron!<eos> I am not a robot!<eos> Huh? Are you still here?
What's up, Black Hammer?<eos> Move, Assface.<eos> I'm not in the mood right now.<eos> Y'all done made me mad.<eos> I'mma show Lieutenant Brooks.<eos> Show all y'all.<eos> People, get out of my way!<eos> Right now, I'm getting in my zone.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You wanna chase me?
And, please, tell the guys that midnight is coming early tonight.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh, I know that look.<eos> "How come the nerd is with all the hotties?"<eos> Well, anyway, Stevie B's gonna be here in an hour, tops.<eos> And you said you didn't get a bachelor party.<eos> And we are in a club with ladies.<eos> And we are on official police business, so...<eos> You want to look like cops?
To my brother-in-law, Benjamin Barber.<eos> That's me.<eos> He's 5'4".<eos> Gonna marry my sister.<eos> Just graduated from the academy.<eos> You're not doing anything, but stating facts.<eos> Give me something from the heart!<eos> That's all I got.<eos> We ain't even here for this!<eos> Guys, do you know what time it is?
Okay.<eos> When did we start doing that?<eos> All right, Maya, what you got?<eos> My guy Alonso's following a lead on the explosives.<eos> He said it's definitely not from the States.<eos> We got a number on AJ.<eos> No, Ben got a number on AJ.<eos> His girl say he stole some money, but she didn't know from who.<eos> Great.<eos> Let me know when you find him.
Hello?<eos> Ben Barber speaking.<eos> How'd you get this number?<eos> It's a little something called platinum-level detectiveness, AJ.<eos> Give me that phone.<eos> AJ, your girlfriend told us about the money you stole.<eos> Whoa! I didn't steal any money.<eos> Be open.<eos> You need to turn yourself in, man. We need to keep you safe.<eos> How do I know you weren't in on trying to kill me?
Everybody hold on!<eos> Shit!<eos> He went left!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I'm Ben Barber, bitch!<eos> Game over.<eos> Get your ass out.<eos> Come on, dude!<eos> Let me go.<eos> You guys are nuts.
Safe house.<eos> We staying here till we find out who we can trust.<eos> Really, fellas?<eos> - Whose house is this?<eos> - Alonso's.<eos> My explosives guy.<eos> He's out on a case.<eos> Who the hell is she?<eos> I'm Miami homicide.<eos> James, if you give me to the cops, I will be hanging from a bedsheet.
Let's go.<eos> - Okay, Ben, go up the first set of stairs.<eos> - Roger that.<eos> And, proceed to the end of the hallway.<eos> All right, James, it's stealth mode time.<eos> Do you even know what "stealth mode" mean?<eos> Yes, it's from Assassin's Creed. It means to be undetectable.<eos> The double doors to his office are on the left.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tell me when you're there.
All right, I got it.<eos> The rest takes care of itself.<eos> Thank you, my darling.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> So tell me about this tequila. Is it rare?<eos> One of the rarest on the market.<eos> Impossible to purchase.<eos> Salud.<eos> Okay, moments away, guys.<eos> Look, you guys need to hurry up.
Here you go.<eos> This has got to be one of the worst goddamn days.<eos> Alligators, hydrangeas, swords all over the place.<eos> Where your shoe?<eos> It's a long story, James.<eos> The man got a damn alligator.<eos> You look silly!<eos> This look better, James?<eos> Is that better, now?<eos> Hey, guys, did you get it?
Okay, here we go.<eos> Hands! Hands up!<eos> Get your hands up!<eos> Get them hands up!<eos> - Put your hands up!<eos> - Ben, get the door!<eos> Out the cab, Slim!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Turn around!<eos> You know who this truck belong to?
Good luck, guys.<eos> Okay, look, we got eight hours to make it back.<eos> James, the only way we're going to make it back is by plane.<eos> Do I look like a bird?<eos> James, stop, man, I'm serious.<eos> That's the only way we're going to make it back.<eos> I don't fly.<eos> This is my wedding, James.<eos> Hey!<eos> After all that, you guys were gonna leave without saying anything?
Okay, I'll get it myself.<eos> Happy Kwanzaa, Ben.<eos> Sorry for your loss.<eos> Assface, let me borrow your keys!<eos> It's a wedding, AJ.<eos> Ain't nobody die.<eos> Thank you, babe.<eos> Stop, guys.<eos> Look, I should have told you earlier, but I didn't.<eos> I'm glad you decided to finally join us.
You're awesome, Judy!<eos> Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't know what he's talking about.<eos> Well, he was right about one thing.<eos> I don't know when to quit.<eos> Listen up, cadets.<eos> Zootopia has 12 unique ecosystems within its city limits.<eos> Tundratown...<eos> Sahara Square...<eos> Rainforest District, to name a few.<eos> You're gonna have to master all of them before you hit the streets, or guess what? You'll be dead!
Stop!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Coming through.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Pardon.<eos> Bon voyage-e, flat foot!<eos> Hey, stop right there!<eos> Have a donut, copper!<eos> Oh, my God. Did you see those leopard print jeggings?
These guys, they be naked.<eos> Nangi's just on the other side of the Pleasure Pool.<eos> Oh, boy. Does this make you uncomfortable?<eos> Because if so, there is no shame in calling it quits.<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> Boy, that's the spirit.<eos> Yeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird... but you know what I say is weird?<eos> Clothes on animals!<eos> Here we go.<eos> As you can see, Nangi's an elephant, so she'll totally remember everything.
They call him Mr. Big.<eos> And he does not like me.<eos> So we gotta go!<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> This is a crime scene.<eos> It's gonna be an even bigger crime scene if Mr. Big finds me here... so we're leaving right now.<eos> Raymond!<eos> And is that Kevin?<eos> Long time, no see.<eos> And, speaking of "no see," how about you forget you saw me?
All right.<eos> Get in here.<eos> Okay. You bunnies are so emotional.<eos> There we go.<eos> Deep breath.<eos> Are you just trying to steal the pen?<eos> Is that what this is?<eos> You are standing on my tail, though.<eos> Off, off, off. I'm sorry.<eos> I thought you guys only grew carrots.
Off, off, off. I'm sorry.<eos> I thought you guys only grew carrots.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.<eos> Okay.<eos> How?<eos> Know this guy?<eos> I told you. I know everybody.<eos> Step right up.<eos> Anything you need, I got it.
When I was a kid... I thought Zootopia was this perfect place.<eos> Where everyone got along and anyone could be anything.<eos> Turns out, real life's a little bit more complicated... than a slogan on a bumper sticker.<eos> Real life is messy<eos> We all have limitations.<eos> We all make mistakes.<eos> Which means, hey, glass half-full, we all have a lot in common.<eos> And the more we try to understand one another... the more exceptional each of us will be.<eos> But we have to try<eos> So, no matter what type of animal you are... from the biggest elephant... to our first fox...
Lois!<eos> Crime lab, on three.<eos> - This is Lane.<eos> - Kent.<eos> You're Sports today.<eos> I want you to follow up on football.<eos> "Underdog Dreams Dashed:<eos> Ten Yards Between Gotham and Glory."<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you guys watching this?
I'm guessing I'm the first to see through that babe-in-the-woods act.<eos> You don't know me, but I've known a few women like you.<eos> I don't think you've ever known a woman like me.<eos> You know, it's true what they say about little boys.<eos> Born with no natural inclination to share.<eos> I didn't steal your drive.<eos> I borrowed it.<eos> You'll find it in the glove compartment of your car.<eos> Mr. Wayne.<eos> Did you get it?
But having said that,<eos> I make sure you go in with everything that you need-- access codes, schematics, schedules, equipment.<eos> Once we start, how much time do we have to get to the spot?<eos> Fifteen minutes.<eos> It's tight but doable.<eos> You miss your window, that's it.<eos> You want a second chance, I start all over.<eos> You pay me again.<eos> Oh, boy, you better be good.<eos> Look, guys, this is like nothing that you've ever done before.

My rig's empty.<eos> Whoo-hoo!<eos> Pack it up.<eos> Iwasfucked, andI didn'tevenknowit.<eos> Perhapsthereason anyofthishappened isbecauseIwas distracted.<eos> CatherineJillbarrow, otherwiseknownas Cate, mydaughter.<eos> Sure,shecouldpickme outofacrowd, butweneverreallyspent anytimetogether.<eos> Noonelovesthatkid morethanme , butoursituation isa little,uh ...<eos> Our boss wants to renegotiate.<eos> You're not getting a dime from me.
We collected fronds from the pine trees and lined the bottom with them.<eos> And he says, "Alan, what do we need now?"<eos> And I knew.<eos> We needed a needle and thread.<eos> Or... duct tape.<eos> For what?<eos> To make a sleeping bag out of our clothes.<eos> We cut up our jackets and we taped them together and made a big, wide sleeping bag.<eos> And we slept there in our long underwear.<eos> - And you shared the sleeping bag?

Lunch in the hole.<eos> All right, enough of this shit.<eos> Lunch is over.<eos> You're coming with us now. Let's go.<eos> I can't.<eos> I got a chain around my neck.<eos> You know you're gonna have to use two of those.<eos> Yeah!<eos> You fuckers.<eos> Oh, you fuckers.
Politicians, religious fanatics. Brainwashing by corporations, the corruption of the banking system...<eos> Gone. Gone.<eos> Washington, Berlin, Beijing will be graveyards.<eos> And only then people will understand there is a better way to run this world.<eos> And that's what you really want here, worldwide revolution.<eos> Governments must fall.<eos> Got one.<eos> Elsa Mueller. Former German Special Forces.<eos> One of Heimdahl's.<eos> Guys, you gotta roll.
I want a better deal than Snowden got.<eos> I need guaranteed protection and $10 million.<eos> It's not about the money, it's about my freedom.<eos> I will demonstrate my control over Vigilant Shield today at 6:00 p.m.<eos> Jillian called the police.<eos> They put out a description of the intruder.<eos> It matches Jerico.<eos> She told them he knew personal details.<eos> PIN number, house security code.<eos> You're shitting me.
So, go back to where you came from, you burned beast!<eos> The tiger knows who rules this part of the jungle.<eos> I'm sure he doesn't mean to come here and make threats.<eos> Especially during a water truce.<eos> No, I'm deeply respectful of these laws that keep us safe.<eos> So, here's my promise.<eos> Nothing lasts forever.<eos> The rains will return and the river will rise.<eos> And when this rock disappears, that truce will end.<eos> You want to protect him, fine.
What do you mean?<eos> I'm bringing you to the man village.<eos> What?<eos> Bagheera, I don't know man.<eos> You will.<eos> You always said we're not supposed to go near a man village.<eos> That was different.<eos> Why is it different?<eos> You always said, "stay away from the man village...<eos> "Because you might fall in a trap... "Or get eaten, or get hurt by flying rocks."
Akelai that's right.<eos> You and I no longer have a quarrel.<eos> And, most importantly... We have peace.<eos> I guess it's done, then.<eos> Unless I can draw him... Back out!<eos> Akela!<eos> Have I got your attention now?<eos> I didn't want it to be this way.<eos> I made it so simple.<eos> All I asked for was one thing, and you denied me!
Unless I can draw him... Back out!<eos> Akela!<eos> Have I got your attention now?<eos> I didn't want it to be this way.<eos> I made it so simple.<eos> All I asked for was one thing, and you denied me!<eos> That ends now.<eos> Spread the word.<eos> Until I have the man-cub, these hills are my hills.<eos> You did not respond to reason!

I'm trying to concentrate.<eos> - Everything going a-okay up there?<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Looks like you got another one.<eos> - Buzz off.<eos> -It's a man-cub.<eos> - A man-cub? - Yeah, it's a man-cub.<eos> - It's not a monkey?<eos> - No, it's a man-cub!<eos> You have never been a more endangered species... Than you are at this moment.
You have never been a more endangered species... Than you are at this moment.<eos> You're doing an amazing job!<eos> I'm getting stung!<eos> Oh, boy. Here we go again.<eos> -It's not a monkey, Fred.<eos> -It's a man-cub.<eos> - A man-cub? - Yeah, it's a man-cub.<eos> - Can you believe it?<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Would you please shut up?
Just till winter.<eos> Just till winter.<eos> Ami, wake up.<eos> Pups?<eos> They're up there.<eos> The deer, of course, take comfort in numbers.<eos> They lack defences most animals will have.<eos> And if we're being honest... They're not very smart either.<eos> Unlike the mother crocodile, who is a good deal more clever.<eos> But the one you have to watch out for... Is the cuckoo bird.

And if we're being honest... They're not very smart either.<eos> Unlike the mother crocodile, who is a good deal more clever.<eos> But the one you have to watch out for... Is the cuckoo bird.<eos> Do you know how the cuckoo bird survives?<eos> By preying on a mother's weakness.<eos> The cuckoo bird is too clever to raise its young.<eos> Instead, it sneaks... Its eggs into the nests of simpler birds.<eos> So, when they hatch... The mother bird is fooled.<eos> She feeds them, nurtures them.<eos> And do you know what happens to her own chicks?
I can't!<eos> You will!<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Anybody?<eos> Excuse me... Am I in the right monkey temple?<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Is that king Louie?<eos> This is so exciting.<eos> The legends do you no justice, sir.<eos> You are truly enormous.
Is that king Louie?<eos> This is so exciting.<eos> The legends do you no justice, sir.<eos> You are truly enormous.<eos> In the best way.<eos> Look at all of that flesh... Just squatting there... On an ancient throne.<eos> How majestic.<eos> Seize him.<eos> Hey, hang on.<eos> Can you just hang on?
Just to be in your presence.<eos> For me, this is a dream come true. Oh...<eos> Throw him off the cliff.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> I have no problem with that.<eos> I don't have any problem with that.<eos> I came up here without an invitation.<eos> It was extremely presumptuous of me.<eos> Let me interrupt myself.<eos> I just gotta say... You guys are so much handsomer in person than anyone knows.

You guys are so much handsomer in person than anyone knows.<eos> No one ever gets up close to you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because of the smell.<eos> The smell is rough.<eos> But it's not just, "oh, look at me."<eos> It's, "Igot the brains." You guys got the know-how.

- Bagheera!<eos> - Mowgli?<eos> Stay there.<eos> We'll come around to you.<eos> Is it true?<eos> What?<eos> Is akela dead?<eos> We were going to tell you.<eos> You knew!<eos> You both knew!
No claws, no fur, no teeth...<eos> And no friends.<eos> "This is the law of the jungle... "As old and as true as the sky."<eos> What is this?<eos> "The wolf that keeps it may prosper... "But the wolf that breaks it will die."<eos> You fools.<eos> "Like the creeper that girdles the tree trunk... "The law runneth over and back."<eos> Fine!<eos> Rise up, all of you!<eos> You want to put yourselves between me and the man-cub?
I saw a little boy... Without a people... Bring all the jungle together for the very first time.<eos> Just a few more turns.<eos> "M going high!<eos> Stay low.<eos> He never listens.<eos> Gotcha!<eos> - Come on, Mowgli.<eos> - You went in the tree.<eos> - That wasn't fair. - We almost made it.<eos> You guys... Are going too fast.

Peter.<eos> Come now.<eos> It is lit.<eos> Looks good.<eos> [Moan]<eos> Be careful!<eos> - You can take it?<eos> - I think so.<eos> [Laughter]<eos> Can you help us?
I'm going for a walk. Start the dance.<eos> See you soon.<eos> - Ah!<eos> - At last!<eos> [Voices and laughter]<eos> - Hi, Lisbeth.<eos> [Mocking laughter]<eos> - Hi, Peter.<eos> - His name is Peter!<eos> - Did you sell your coal?
Look.<eos> Know what?<eos> I also want to be a glassmaker.<eos> - Coal man!<eos> - Coal man!<eos> - Coal man!<eos> Where is he?<eos> Coal man, your heater is burning.<eos> Won't you do something?<eos> Why don't you help him?
- 200 florins.<eos> - 250 florins.<eos> 250 florins.<eos> 250. Give it one...<eos> give it two...<eos> - And give it three.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Tha auction is over.<eos> Tha glass factory goes to Peter Munk.<eos> Where do you want to go now?

It's very hot.<eos> Something is wrong.<eos> It's not even melted yet.<eos> [Beat]<eos> Yeah?<eos> - How are you?<eos> - It's bad for Mom.<eos> She doesn't leave the house anymore.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> - Who are you?
You know what Löbl would do to me if I buy your glass?<eos> - Where is Etzel?<eos> - In Holland, selling wood.<eos> Holland...<eos> When does he come back?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> [Discussion]<eos> What do you want with my father?<eos> I owe you no satisfaction.<eos> - Do you have secrets?
- Because you have no heart anymore.<eos> - Lisbeth.<eos> I was very sick.<eos> A doctor in Holland healed me. You know it.<eos> This is not true.<eos> It was Michel the Dutchman.<eos> Lisbeth!<eos> Michel the Dutchman has your heart.<eos> [Whisper]<eos> Why do not you believe me?
Dad?<eos> Dad!<eos> Bury him.<eos> Throw him away.<eos> Do with them as you please.<eos> [Peace music]<eos> The glass captures the fire.<eos> One time someone told me.<eos> [Subtle female voice]<eos> You wanted to be the masters of the world.
Keith and I are going to sneak out tonight with his friend, Michael, who wants to meet you, by the way.<eos> No way.<eos> If my mum ever found out, I'd be dead.<eos> So don't get caught, you priss.<eos> Here, hold this.<eos> Gotta give you back the spirit board that we made.<eos> I think I'll let Keith French kiss me.<eos> What?<eos> No way!<eos> What you two doing?
I got bit. I'm not lying!<eos> He bit me!<eos> Look!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Have you two been playing with this?<eos> Taking turns scaring the wits out of each other?<eos> No wonder I can't get a good night's sleep!<eos> - But, Mum-- - No!<eos> I don't wanna hear another word.<eos> Now get back to bed, the lot of you!
Mmm.<eos> Janet.<eos> Janet, are you feeling all right?<eos> Stop calling me Janet!<eos> Isn't that your name?<eos> Janet's asleep...<eos> And I'm talking.<eos> Well, what should I call you?<eos> What is your name?<eos> You don't belong here.
Why don't you just leave us alone?<eos> Shut up, you old cow!<eos> Janet, darling.<eos> Darling, are you all right?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Janet.<eos> Peggy, what am I gonna do?<eos> Oh...<eos> You don't need to think about it tonight.<eos> And you and the kids can stay here as long as you like.
Yes.<eos> We do.<eos> But the Church can't do anything without proof.<eos> That's what we need.<eos> Right, listen.<eos> I'll make some telephone calls, see if I can get hold of some video recording equipment.<eos> In the meantime, Ed and I can be spending time with Peggy and the kids, because they need to be a family again.<eos> Hi, Mom!<eos> We're back!<eos> What are you doing back?
Why else would he give us that clue?<eos> He must think that we know it somehow.<eos> So, what do you do now?<eos> An inhuman spirit powerful enough to cloud Lorraine's sight is more than a match for me.<eos> We need to get Janet to the Church before it kills her.<eos> Janet!<eos> What happened?<eos> Janet!<eos> Janet!<eos> Thank God you're here.
I wanna train with Tong Po. I wanna train with Master Po.<eos> Put it back.<eos> And the money.<eos> You know what, keep it.<eos> - All of it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You need it more than I do.<eos> You fighters from around the world have been invited to train with Master Po.<eos> And witness the impossible.<eos> Now, you might think that Master Po has run out of the unthinkable. But he'd like to challenge himself and stay creative.
Right.<eos> So, who wants to go to Thailand?<eos> Jesus, can you give a guy a moment of victory? We're having a party here.<eos> - I'm talking immortality. - Immortality.<eos> No rules, no ref.<eos> - Just your wit and skill to keep you alive.<eos> - What do you mean no rules?<eos> No, wait, I heard about these underground fights over here, but what's in it for us?<eos> Well, 200k right now.<eos> And 200 when you land.
Do you know what we could do with this information knowing that she's listening?<eos> We could send her to a much better place for us.<eos> It's been her crusade for years.<eos> Without her, none of this would be happening.<eos> Without her, doesn't that sound ideal?<eos> You want it clean or messy?<eos> Make her an example.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> This is for your own good.<eos> You're both under arrest.
It's on the far side. Here. Come on.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - It's in there.<eos> We're gonna need more guys.<eos> What is it?<eos> A bear?<eos> No.<eos> Just open it up and look.<eos> Grab that.<eos> You're going to need, like, 12 more of those things.
What is that?<eos> Tripp!<eos> Fine, just keep the truck!<eos> You said you live close, right?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Are you just gonna...<eos> I mean, seriously, Tripp, what...<eos> It's moving the truck.<eos> Okay.<eos> My dad barely comes in here, so you should be fine for the night.
Hi.<eos> I'm Meredith.<eos> Wade.<eos> This is something.<eos> This is solid.<eos> This is solid work.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Come on up.<eos> Why don't you park it at my trailer?
Oh!<eos> Here we go.<eos> Delete.<eos> Delete.<eos> Delete.<eos> Delete.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You can't just delete pictures and think this goes away.<eos> Why?<eos> What are you going to do?
- What?<eos> Spiritually.<eos> Okay, I'm messing this up.<eos> Sorry. I'm a scientist, a geologist.<eos> But I want to help you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I can't just stand here and watch them die.<eos> And why should we trust you?<eos> Because these creatures are special.<eos> I think that you've seen that, too.
No way. Okay?<eos> I'm done doing their dirty work.<eos> Okay, then help us get them out of here.<eos> We need to get them home.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> Okay. It's 50 miles of rough terrain back to the vent.<eos> Any truck big enough to carry them would be too slow and we'd get caught.<eos> I got a truck fast enough.<eos> We just gotta find two more.<eos> If you think we can do this, I'm in.
All by morning.<eos> Twice.<eos> Maybe we'd get one done, but two?<eos> I don't have the tools or the parts to get it done that quick.<eos> Do you know someone with a repair shop?<eos> - Or...<eos> - A dealership.<eos> You know, you're going to have to, like, hang out with him and stuff after this.<eos> Maybe once.<eos> You'll be out by 7:00, right?
Tripp, there's a 99% chance that would be impossible.<eos> Maybe 100%.<eos> You be careful, son.<eos> Rick, I'm sorry I said all those terrible things about you.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come on, Creech!<eos> Go, Tripp!<eos> We made it!<eos> You guys take out the pumps, I'll handle the tanker.
Or are they common thieves?<eos> Depends on your point of view.<eos> Here's what you know.<eos> They robbed a bank in Paris from a stage in Las Vegas.<eos> They fleeced an insurance magnate of hundreds of millions of dollars and disappeared from a roof in New York.<eos> Always showering their devoted fans with money.<eos> Here's what you don't know.<eos> They left one man behind. Framed.<eos> Holding the bag. Me.<eos> Are you listening, Horsemen?

When you emerge, and you will, I will be there waiting.<eos> Because mark my words, you will get what's coming to you.<eos> But very much deserve.<eos> Because one thing I believe in is an eye for an eye.<eos> Welcome, Daniel Atlas.<eos> Who am I speaking to?<eos> I asked to see the face behind all of this.<eos> You've asked many questions. And registered many complaints.<eos> You can rest assured that we've heard you.<eos> Have you?
Until we work as a single organism. I know, I've heard you say that.<eos> The thing is, when you say that, I think what you're referring to is us, not you.<eos> Listen, I'm getting my orders directly from the Eye.<eos> Okay? And then I give them to you.<eos> Now, if you don't like that, you're welcome to go.<eos> No, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> But I'm... Mmm. I'm taking care of myself.<eos> Guys, can I just weigh in here really quickly?<eos> Because I think I see what's going on here.<eos> You guys are this amazing, tight-knit family unit. - I'm a new person...

It was an accident, I think.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, does this mean we're actually going to do something?<eos> Yes.<eos> You've all heard of Octa and their playboy CEO, Owen Case.
But from the neck down, the David.<eos> Owen Case.<eos> Good morning, Octa-lites.<eos> Now, I've made the claim...<eos> Now, I've made the claim that Octa 8 is pure magic.<eos> But the truth is, that's just one of those things I say...<eos> You know, the truth is, that's just one of those things I say when in fact I mean something else.<eos> ...when in fact I mean something else.<eos> What else do I mean?<eos> Well, here to fill you in on some of my fabulous lies and hypocrisy, and to perform some of the most dazzling feats of magic you have ever seen...
Wait, what are you saying?<eos> How is this possible?<eos> I believe in your particular parlance, the word is "magic."<eos> That guy looks exactly like you.<eos> He looks exactly like you.<eos> Are you seeing this right now?<eos> Chase.<eos> Must confess, it's like what I heard about meeting the Rolling Stones.<eos> They're a lot shorter in person.<eos> Remember I told you about the guy who screwed me out of everything?

At all.<eos> Okay, let me break it down for you.<eos> You jumped off a rooftop in New York and you landed in Macau.

And presto-changeo.<eos> Don't you just love it?<eos> The "greatest magicians in the world"<eos> are the object of someone else's magic trick?<eos> Isn't that poetic?<eos> No?<eos> You know what, I'm not gonna let you guys yuck my yum.<eos> Shoo-shoo.<eos> Or mu-shu.<eos> Oh, and you know what they say, "What happens in Macau..."
This is simply my move.<eos> Next one is yours.<eos> No!<eos> Let go!<eos> Dad!<eos> Help me!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> It's all about blind spots.<eos> When you're staring straight at something, and not see it.
He's racist.<eos> Hey, bro.<eos> Listen, I know that the only thing that we agree on is that our mom and dad had one too many children.<eos> So why don't we just let the kids play with their toys and go get a little drinkey-poo?<eos> - If it's free, it's me.<eos> - Great. Guys, we'll be right back.<eos> Okay, kiddies, the chaperones are watching you.<eos> Don't do anything I wouldn't enjoy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Have fun, you two.
And I knew it was my job to see to it that he became the magician he was born to be.<eos> All that was left then was... For me to hit bottom.<eos> So the safe, my father's wristwatch, that was all you?<eos> Walter and Tressler, were they in on it too?<eos> Oh, we knew Walter was in hiding.<eos> The Octa show was a setup to expose him to the public.<eos> And you were right about the Horsemen.<eos> They needed to learn to work together like a single organism.<eos> Now I know why you look so familiar.<eos> You're the Horsemen, aren't you?
- What! - Come on.<eos> - That's not right.<eos> That's gonna make me really angry!<eos> Oh, by the way... Pay no attention to the curtain.<eos> There is a curtain.<eos> Go, go!<eos> Seeing is believing.<eos> But is it truth?<eos> Depends on your point of view.<eos> Are you listening, Horsemen?
- That's not right.<eos> That's gonna make me really angry!<eos> Oh, by the way...

It keeps them safe... until they've grown up.<eos> Let them go.<eos> Wait!<eos> I'm taking him home.<eos> This is for you.<eos> It's your mother's journal.<eos> Your mother's name was Andrea Morgan.<eos> And I can tell by reading this... she loved you very, very much.<eos> When you were a baby, she noticed you were special.<eos> It was just the two of you against the world.
My momma, your momma Flying on a switch<eos> My momma, your momma Witches never cry<eos> My momma, your momma Witches gonna die<eos> Witch number one, drown in the river<eos> Witch number two, got a noose to give her<eos> (INDISTINCT CHATTER)<eos> (RINGING)<eos> (SINGING) Witch number three, gonna watch her burn<eos> Witch number four, flogging take a turn<eos> Collect your leaflets before you get food, children.
SHAW SENIOR:<eos> Okay. That's it!<eos> Thank you.<eos> We hope you'll reconsider, Mr. Shaw.<eos> We're not difficult to find.<eos> Until then, we thank you for your time.<eos> Hey, boy! You dropped something.<eos> - (PAPER CRUMPLING)<eos> - Here you go, freak.<eos> Why don't you put that in the trash where you all belong?
What are you telling me here?<eos> That Senator Shaw was killed by a kid?<eos> (SINGING) My momma, your momma Flying on a switch<eos> My momma, your momma Witches never cry<eos> My momma, your momma Witches gonna die<eos> Witch number one, drown in the river<eos> Witch number two, got a noose...<eos> CHASTITY:<eos> Hand out your leaflets.<eos> I'll know if you dump them.

I'm not hurting.<eos> Anyway, it was a long time ago.<eos> That was a real close friendship you had at school.<eos> Neither of us really fitted in at school.<eos> - So, we became quite--<eos> - You became real close?<eos> For years.<eos> She was a taker.<eos> You need a giver.<eos> What are you two talking about?
Some high-end shit.<eos> See that crack head at the end of the bar?<eos> Who's that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why don't you go and find out if you're so brave?<eos> Don't shoot, man.<eos> Don't shoot.<eos> You lookin' for me?<eos> You must be lookin' for Jesus too.<eos> My wife had a light about her... that you and your scumbag friends snuffed out.
- Oh. When will he be back?<eos> Not sure.<eos> He's freelance, so it's hard...<eos> - How 'bout Charley?<eos> - Who is this?<eos> I always wanted a tattoo.<eos> No more arrests for the rest of the night.<eos> What's shakin'?<eos> Lemi K wants to see you.<eos> You are supposed to be protecting me and my people.
We kept Charley's ass out of jail even after a positive ID.<eos> What's your problem?<eos> What's my problem?<eos> My problem is I got guys clocking' my operation.<eos> Someone chases my boy Nate out of the Tick Tock and puts one in his face!<eos> Hey!<eos> Your boy Nate gets capped, that's not our business.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> That's my merchandise.<eos> You're detectives.
Predictable.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But dangerous.<eos> You saw the heat that he's capable of bringing.<eos> Those guys tonight, they were pros.<eos> Now Stan... you got the guys who murdered Vivian.<eos> Maybe it's time just to cash in your chips, head south, and stay there.<eos> No, no.<eos> It's not over.<eos> Okay, you guys.
Dog, sisters. - Hi. - Hey.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Yeah, I work here.<eos> He makes sure the girls outnumber the boys five to one.<eos> I'm surprised he even let you in.<eos> He came with Ev, so I didn't really have a choice.<eos> Speak of the devil.<eos> We've just been hearing about your friend.<eos> - Quite the charmer, isn't he?<eos> - Where did you both meet?
- Hey.<eos> God, he's way cuter in the light.<eos> Yeah, good shoes, too, but shame about the shirt.<eos> I can get past a bad shirt.<eos> I'm feeling recently broken up? Hmm.<eos> Good call. Sagittarius?<eos> Virgo.<eos> I think Virgo.<eos> Uh, well, uh, Taurus, actually.<eos> But you're sort of right about the girlfriend thing. - Taurus.
- Not much.<eos> - So a weird place.<eos> Well, I-I just don't get any of it.<eos> What is it that you don't get?<eos> Well, we've only got seven minutes, so...<eos> Oh, well, you'd better get started.<eos> OK.<eos> Uh, what do you want? Most?<eos> Bottled-up fun.<eos> - What do you all do to live?
- Really?<eos> Well...<eos> Um, Cassius works at The Drambuie.<eos> - Uh, the sisters, they just...<eos> - What about Milo?<eos> That question wasn't on the list.<eos> Um, what do you do?<eos> I'm a full-time daughter of darkness.<eos> Right.<eos> But, no, I just think you're different.
That's beautiful.<eos> He's a real-life Robin Hood.<eos> Yeah, without the bow and arrow.<eos> Is that yours?<eos> Um, yeah. Well, uh, it's Cassius's actually.<eos> Or his friend's, but, um, he gave it to me, which is...<eos> - Really? That's sweet of him. - Yeah.<eos> - What are you gonna do with it?<eos> - Try and take some photos. Other than Cassius in his underwear...<eos> Some proper photos, you know.
- I got a date.<eos> Like a sleepover date?<eos> Not officially, but...<eos> You are such a sleaze.<eos> You're like an advert for chlamydia.<eos> It's way too early for this.<eos> Shall we do something?<eos> Uh, us?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why don't you guys go up to the country?
We're back doing this now where you don't tell me anything. - Hey!<eos> - What?<eos> Just look at me. I'm trying to talk to you.<eos> I'm not playing a game.<eos> - We're all playing games.<eos> - No. No, you and Milo might play games. - I'm not playing a game.<eos> - Don't work yourself up, Jacky.<eos> I'm not getting...<eos> What does that mean, "Don't work yourself up"?<eos> You all play games. It's all a joke to you.
No? ! - No.<eos> - Cas, shut up.<eos> What the fuck were you thinking, Jack?<eos> You better keep that to yourself, my man.<eos> Yeah, of course. Good.<eos> Good.<eos> - Fuck! What was it like?<eos> - Shut up, man.<eos> Please God, tell me Dave didn't drive you all down?<eos> Do you all have a death wish?
He wore clothes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, dark, maybe.<eos> Okay, maybe, and he took a cab.<eos> Yeah, a cab.<eos> Okay, sir, can you just wait right here for us, please?<eos> - Here?<eos> Yeah. - Uh-huh.<eos> Thank you. - Thanks.<eos> - What do you got?
Anybody else see anything?<eos> - Apparently not.<eos> - Cameras?<eos> There's one up the street.<eos> We're not sure if it's working.<eos> Pulling the film.<eos> Who's that?<eos> - He's ours.<eos> - Reckless driving.<eos> You picked him up and brought him here?
You picked him up and brought him here?<eos> What the fuck for?<eos> Well, we just pulled him over when the call comes in...<eos> Well, I don't want him here.<eos> Get a unit.<eos> Take him back to the house or cut him loose.<eos> - Uh, we'll take him, sir.<eos> We're off-duty...<eos> - Not you.<eos> You stay.
I mean, it's quiet. Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Yeah, Maldonado had us pick up this kid.<eos> Cup of coffee, man?<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Watch where you step.<eos> Klein.<eos> Well, I was doing all right. Then I answered the phone.<eos> How much you give me to check?
Fuck you lookin' at?<eos> What can you tell me about the weapon, Harry?<eos> Pretty sure it's one knife.<eos> Approximately one and a half inch wide by, I'm gonna say, five inches long.<eos> Till I get her on the table and probe.<eos> Serrated, or no?<eos> Not sure yet.<eos> Possibly.<eos> What happened?<eos> What, you can't tell me nothing? Or you don't know nothing?
What did he win for them? What did he win for them?<eos> Who the hell is this?<eos> This is Nasir's father, Amir.<eos> Mr. Khan?<eos> Is he with you?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> No.<eos> I haven't seen him.<eos> No, but he said you were going out together tonight.
Didn't he say he was going into Manhattan?<eos> "Is she dead?"<eos> That's what you asked the officers in the car that brought you here.<eos> "Is she dead?"<eos> You don't remember saying that?<eos> They hadn't said anything about her.<eos> Hadn't... said it was a she or a he, let alone dead, nobody had.<eos> So, you were at her place.<eos> Can we agree on that?<eos> You have a couple drinks.
- Yeah, in the pen.<eos> Oh, him.<eos> He cut a girl on 87th Street.<eos> Who did?<eos> They're called razors, Jack, you should invest.<eos> Experiment.<eos> Worse comes to worst, it all grows back.<eos> All right, my man.<eos> All we need now is the knife and clothes and shoes.<eos> I sent all that over before you got here.
Roman, huh?<eos> That's a tribune's ring?<eos> Yes.<eos> Have you come far?
It must pain you to know that the one true God chooses us over you.<eos> Not today, he didn't.<eos> When the Messiah comes, Rome will be nothing!<eos> Until then...<eos> Tribune, Pilate summons you.<eos> I'm yet sticky with filth.<eos> No matter.<eos> There's more trouble.<eos> Come on, come on!<eos> Did you win?
When the Messiah comes, Rome will be nothing!<eos> Until then...<eos> Tribune, Pilate summons you.<eos> I'm yet sticky with filth.<eos> No matter.<eos> There's more trouble.<eos> Come on, come on!<eos> Did you win?<eos> I was told to hurry.<eos> In truth, you're well dressed for this job.
In truth, you're well dressed for this job.<eos> - What's happened?<eos> - Passover.<eos> Every hothead and holy fool in Judaea was here, stirring the pot.<eos> Some ascetic won a following by making waves, so the Sanhedrin decided to put him down.<eos> They sent a lathered mob here, screaming for his blood because he claims to be their Messiah.<eos> I had to crucify him.<eos> Don't give me that look.<eos> I've had enough already.<eos> I had a situation, Tribune, something you don't seem to understand.

Deep breath.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's it.<eos> Let it go.<eos> Get the pliers.<eos> I never killed a king before.<eos> Wait!<eos> Tribune, I come from Pilate.<eos> Please read this.<eos> - You're the Arimathean.
Leave him.<eos> Sir?<eos> Go and find your centurion.<eos> These will bury him.<eos> Please, Tribune.<eos> Gently. Gently.<eos> Come, Clavius, soak this day away.<eos> Fill his cup.<eos> Keep it filled.<eos> What do you desire?
Please, Tribune.<eos> Gently. Gently.<eos> Come, Clavius, soak this day away.<eos> Fill his cup.<eos> Keep it filled.<eos> What do you desire?<eos> A meal? A massage?<eos> A girl?<eos> Just this.<eos> You're young.
Gently. Gently.<eos> Come, Clavius, soak this day away.<eos> Fill his cup.<eos> Keep it filled.<eos> What do you desire?<eos> A meal? A massage?<eos> A girl?<eos> Just this.<eos> You're young.<eos> A night's rest, you'll do it all again.
Let's hope that's buried with him.<eos> It's a strange case.<eos> I've never seen a death so wished for, even by him.<eos> It's as if he wanted to be sacrificed.<eos> They are fanatics.<eos> Yahweh deranges them.<eos> Yes.<eos> No other gods and all that.<eos> I myself pray only to Minerva, for wisdom.<eos> You?
Mars.<eos> Of course.<eos> Well, let's hope one of them hears us.<eos> I could use the help.<eos> One does what one must.<eos> I don't wish the mantle you wear.<eos> Spare me.<eos> It's your path, too.<eos> Your ambition is noticed.<eos> Where do you hope it will lead?
Where do you hope it will lead?<eos> Rome.<eos> And?<eos> Position.<eos> Power.<eos> - Which brings?<eos> - Wealth.<eos> A good family.<eos> Someday, a place in the country.<eos> Where you'll find?
An end to travail.<eos> A day without death.<eos> Peace.<eos> All that for peace?<eos> Is there no other way?<eos> Well, I'm to bed.<eos> Tomorrow promises further punishment.<eos> The Nazarene, did you find him different?<eos> I found him dead.<eos> So you did.
- Peace, Tribune, and good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> A coin for the ferryman.<eos> Journey well, Gaius Aelius.<eos> Legion, forward.<eos> Legion 10.<eos> Fretensis!<eos> Tribune, Pilate summons you.<eos> Salve, Prefect.<eos> You smell of meat.
Fretensis!<eos> Tribune, Pilate summons you.<eos> Salve, Prefect.<eos> You smell of meat.<eos> A feast?<eos> A funeral.<eos> There's your solution.<eos> Burn him in public.<eos> God forbids cremation.<eos> He also forbids labor on the Sabbath, and yet here you are.
- He's business unfinished.<eos> The man's dead, Caiaphas.<eos> His followers are in hiding.<eos> He's no longer a threat to your monopoly on piety.<eos> But still a threat, Prefect.<eos> While alive, that deceiver said he would rise again after three days.<eos> He foretold it.<eos> We request that the sepulcher be sealed, lest his disciples come in the night, steal the body and say that he is risen from death.<eos> That would cause more unrest in this city than all his blasphemies combined.<eos> You have your own guard.
Where's your centurion?<eos> He's not himself, sir.<eos> Not since yesterday.<eos> Is that what pains you?<eos> No, sir.<eos> No.<eos> It's just...<eos> We were to have the night off.<eos> I'll have rations sent.<eos> You're Sanhedrin, too, are you not?
Not since yesterday.<eos> Is that what pains you?<eos> No, sir.<eos> No.<eos> It's just...<eos> We were to have the night off.<eos> I'll have rations sent.<eos> You're Sanhedrin, too, are you not?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your brothers despise this man, yet you mourn him.
No.<eos> It's just...<eos> We were to have the night off.<eos> I'll have rations sent.<eos> You're Sanhedrin, too, are you not?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your brothers despise this man, yet you mourn him.<eos> He was very special.<eos> A king?<eos> You test me, Tribune.
- What happened?<eos> - Exactly as I had predicted.<eos> The heretic's disciples came in the night and stole the body.<eos> Already, they are proclaiming him risen from death.<eos> Will the people believe it?<eos> The weak will.<eos> Others want to.<eos> So we must announce the theft.<eos> Will they believe you?<eos> They'll believe the guards, if you don't kill them first.
Will they believe you?<eos> They'll believe the guards, if you don't kill them first.<eos> Endless.<eos> Proclaim it before this blossoms.<eos> It's not enough.<eos> Without a corpse to prove him dead, we have a potential Messiah.<eos> I want no doubt.<eos> Tiberius cannot arrive to unrest.<eos> We must find a body.<eos> - Will you help?
It's not enough.<eos> Without a corpse to prove him dead, we have a potential Messiah.<eos> I want no doubt.<eos> Tiberius cannot arrive to unrest.<eos> We must find a body.<eos> - Will you help?<eos> - Of course.<eos> But proclaim it.<eos> Was my confidence in you misplaced, Tribune?<eos> Perhaps you'd prefer a post in hell.

Perhaps you'd prefer a post in hell.<eos> You will track down each and every one of these disciples.<eos> But more importantly, you will find the corpse of this cursed Yeshua before it rots.<eos> Bring the Arimathean.<eos> You, get the Arimathean.<eos> As if they burst.<eos> Tribune, see this.<eos> Oh, my!<eos> - Where has he gone?<eos> - You tell me.
Every one.<eos> And bring him to me presently.<eos> Tribune.<eos> I said, "In private."<eos> Where's your fellow?<eos> He doesn't wish to speak.<eos> Truly?<eos> Well, he had no trouble avowing the Nazarene's theft.<eos> He's afraid, as am I.<eos> So you should be.

And you saw this while sleeping?<eos> No.<eos> No, I...<eos> We...<eos> We awoke as they were cutting the ropes.<eos> - Cutting them?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> And then they rolled away the stone, took his body and ran.<eos> While you watched?
We...<eos> We awoke as they were cutting the ropes.<eos> - Cutting them?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> And then they rolled away the stone, took his body and ran.<eos> While you watched?<eos> Yes, but we were held at spear point.<eos> Soldier, have you been told to say these things?<eos> - Were you drinking that night?
Wait till you see combat.<eos> No.<eos> The hand's missing, but see the hole in the other?<eos> Not him.<eos> Legs are broken.<eos> That's why we need your eyes, Tribune.<eos> This grave here is very hasty and shallow.<eos> Well?<eos> Two score, we questioned.<eos> Eleven, I think, you should examine.
Truth will not prove fatal today.<eos> I was moved by what he said and what he taught.<eos> And felt he didn't deserve such a death.<eos> They ripped open your tomb to steal a corpse to promote a lie that threatens Rome and the Sanhedrin.<eos> It was not Yeshua's followers.<eos> Not the true ones.<eos> They are heartbroken.<eos> Some say he is risen to lead Israel against us.<eos> The Messiah.<eos> Do you believe that?

I confess.<eos> You asked if he was a king.<eos> I return his crown.<eos> Sit.<eos> Why do you tremble?<eos> You're a Roman.<eos> You were heard shouting, "Yeshua yet lives."<eos> Joyously, says the report.<eos> Why?<eos> You obviously didn't see him.
I know voices.<eos> I hear them.<eos> I have no doubt.<eos> Were you a follower of the Nazarene, Miriam?<eos> Or just a follower of a follower?<eos> He loved me.<eos> An old woman.<eos> He lifted me up.<eos> Lifted you?<eos> If you knew him, you'd understand.

Halt!<eos> Shalom, Mary.<eos> Why did you run from us?<eos> Instinct.<eos> I've seen you before.<eos> My other life?<eos> At Yeshua's death.<eos> You were there beside his mother.<eos> Was she also the woman with you at his tomb?<eos> If you knew what happened there, all cares would cease.
I could have what I want pulled from you, put you to death like that.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> - A martyr.<eos> - No.<eos> Then give me the others, and I'll grant you freedom.<eos> I'm already free.<eos> Show me the Messiah.<eos> Alive or dead.<eos> And show me those who follow him.<eos> You look for something you'll never find, Tribune.

You guys think Stiles sent us here to warn us?<eos> Maybe Beacon Hills is gonna be the next ghost town.<eos> If we don't stop it, yes.<eos> We need to get them to leave. Now.<eos> We can't.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You're gonna help us.<eos> Liam, I don't know what to do.<eos> Well, you remember Stiles, so clearly you know more than we do.<eos> You're gonna help us or you're going back.
Okay, I was thinking about Lenore.<eos> There's myths about the Wild Hunt and the Morrigan.<eos> They left Lenore behind.<eos> I thought Lenore was a banshee?<eos> The Morrigan was a banshee.<eos> So when the Wild Hunt moves on from Beacon Hills...<eos> I'll be like Lenore.<eos> Left behind.<eos> Alone.<eos> I hope you realize it's taking all of my strength to not tear you in half right now.

An unstoppable army?<eos> Made up of the dead, you say?<eos> With power you have never seen.<eos> Tell me, how would you control this unstoppable army?<eos> How do you stop the unstoppable?<eos> How is your Kampfgruppe going to stop them?<eos> Tell us.<eos> How are you going to perform this miracle?<eos> With German efficiency.<eos> You're going to bite Stiles?

He's good at that.<eos> So the plan is to get Stiles to come up with a plan.<eos> You can shut up now.<eos> Malia, look around. We're the only ones left in Beacon Hills.<eos> If they take us, Lydia will be the only one left to haunt the place.<eos> That's why I'm the only person that's going in.<eos> Liam and Hayden will stay here with Mason.<eos> As long as somebody is left in Beacon Hills, the Wild Hunt can't move on.<eos> - But it can't work.<eos> - How do you know?
Liam and Hayden will stay here with Mason.<eos> As long as somebody is left in Beacon Hills, the Wild Hunt can't move on.<eos> - But it can't work.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Logic.<eos> Life experience.<eos> Liam, what are the odds that he'll get taken?<eos> What if Stiles isn't there?<eos> What if there's no Beacon Hills for you to come back to?<eos> You got a better idea? Yeah.

It means he's not dead, Mason.<eos> And that there's still a chance.<eos> He only has pictures of us.<eos> There's, like, a hundred pictures here.<eos> And it's just us.<eos> Is that a little weird?<eos> No.<eos> It means he loves you.<eos> We need to get him back.<eos> When you were here before, how long until the Ghost Riders showed up?
I can't see a thing.<eos> It's got to be down here somewhere.<eos> Found it!<eos> It's remarkably similar.<eos> To what?<eos> To the Einstein-Rosen bridge.<eos> That's never going to happen.<eos> We're not making that deal.<eos> I hold all the cards.<eos> You're locked in a jail cell.

I hold all the cards.<eos> You're locked in a jail cell.<eos> You have no cards.<eos> You want me to tell you about Douglas.<eos> Break the sword.<eos> Does anyone else want to do the negotiating?<eos> Break the sword.<eos> I'll break the sword.<eos> I'll break it right in... Hayden.<eos> You break, I talk.

Why is he still obsessed?<eos> What does he want an army for?<eos> He doesn't want it for them.<eos> The Nazis were just a means to an end.<eos> He wants it for himself.<eos> His own personal, supernatural army.<eos> We need to warn Scott.<eos> You know what the best part about being a werewolf is?<eos> Supernatural hearing.<eos> Did you hear that?
Yeah, Liam, come on.<eos> We gotta hurry.<eos> We can still find him.<eos> No!<eos> Liam.<eos> Run!<eos> Liam.<eos> We have to get to Scott.<eos> Liam.<eos> You have to find Scott.
We can still find him.<eos> No!<eos> Liam.<eos> Run!<eos> Liam.<eos> We have to get to Scott.<eos> Liam.<eos> You have to find Scott.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> You have to.
No!<eos> Liam.<eos> Run!<eos> Liam.<eos> We have to get to Scott.<eos> Liam.<eos> You have to find Scott.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> You have to.<eos> You can save me on the other side.
I don't know how it happened, but it happened.<eos> Everything Lydia has been trying to tell us?<eos> It's all true.<eos> His bed, the clothes he never folds, his crime board.<eos> He's on the lacrosse team.<eos> I mean, he's terrible, but he's on the team.<eos> Claudia, we have a son.<eos> And we can find him and get him back.<eos> There's nothing here.<eos> You gotta come in the room, baby.

No.<eos> We always wanted to go to Big Sur.<eos> We did. I remember.<eos> No, baby.<eos> We didn't.<eos> I took this picture on your last good day.<eos> Stiles refused to leave your side.<eos> I was sick.<eos> But I started getting better.<eos> You were yourself all day.
I had my wife back.<eos> The medication had started to work.<eos> Stiles couldn't stop talking about school, all the trouble he'd gotten into.<eos> He tried so hard to stay awake.<eos> When he finally fell asleep, it was in your arms.<eos> The doctors couldn't explain it.<eos> We started making plans, started dreaming again.<eos> We just sat together and watched each other.<eos> We didn't need to talk.<eos> But, when you finally closed your eyes,

Previously on Teen Wolf...<eos> The Ghost Riders, how do we stop 'em?<eos> We can find a person to absorb the lightning.<eos> Whatever happens will be your responsibility.<eos> Where's my sister?<eos> You killed her, remember?<eos> I can help. I know about the Wild Hunt from the Dread Doctors.<eos> - Where's Stiles?<eos> - You remember Stiles?
Theo...<eos> Theo...<eos> Theo...<eos> Theo...<eos> No, Tara, don't.<eos> Theo...<eos> Theo...<eos> Theo...<eos> It's okay.<eos> You don't have to stop.
Theo...<eos> Theo...<eos> Theo...<eos> No, Tara, don't.<eos> Theo...<eos> Theo...<eos> Theo...<eos> It's okay.<eos> You don't have to stop.<eos> It's okay, you don't have to stop.
It's so awkward when Mom and Dad fight.<eos> Shut up!<eos> You both are right.<eos> If Theo tries anything, we'll send him back to the Skinwalkers.<eos> But for right now...<eos> He goes back now.<eos> - Except Liam's the one with the sword.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Malia...<eos> Can you give me a second alone with Theo?
- Except Liam's the one with the sword.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Malia...<eos> Can you give me a second alone with Theo?<eos> - Why?<eos> - So I can kill him.<eos> Okay, look, I know that there's mixed feelings all around.<eos> But I might be your only option to stop the Wild Hunt.<eos> Let's kill him.<eos> What, you don't trust me?

No.<eos> But I think we can use him.<eos> Remember who he is.<eos> He got into your head and you tried to kill me.<eos> And when that didn't work, he did kill me.<eos> And Tracy, and Josh, and his sister.<eos> But this might be our only chance to get Stiles back.<eos> Can't we just try to find somebody that we at least trust?<eos> This might be a mistake.<eos> But you don't know that yet.

Convince me.<eos> I can put you back in the ground anytime.<eos> You also need a transformer that can handle five billion joules of electricity.<eos> I know where to find one and I can show you how it works.<eos> I'll tell you if Malia promises not to kill me.<eos> She promises.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> We're really gonna do this?<eos> Trust him?<eos> You got a better idea?
She promises.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> We're really gonna do this?<eos> Trust him?<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> I've got an idea.<eos> It may not be better. But at least it's not him.<eos> Noah.<eos> Come out of there.<eos> Did you know about this room?
Why was it sealed off?<eos> The previous owners probably did it.<eos> I... People do crazy things.<eos> What if this was his room?<eos> What if this means we had a son?<eos> Noah...<eos> Claudia, this could be the proof we're looking for.<eos> There are so many simple explanations for why this is here.<eos> But we had a son we've forgotten is not one of them.<eos> Aren't you curious?

They ride the lightning.<eos> We can use that to catch one and keep him there until we figure out what they want.<eos> It's a good idea.<eos> You're trying to catch a Ghost Rider.<eos> A million things can go wrong.<eos> Terrible idea.<eos> The bad idea was bringing him back.<eos> Scott's right.<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> You took a risk.
But it was the right thing to do.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> You guys want me to leave you alone?<eos> Oh, that's right, I can't.<eos> We better hurry.<eos> You did it.<eos> Of course we did it.<eos> This thing can transmute the energy from a lightning bolt.<eos> Even successive strikes.<eos> Mason, are you sure this is gonna work?
Drawing the Ghost Rider to that spot.<eos> We can't send him directly in because the cage neutralizes electromagnetism.<eos> Lightning will just bounce off it.<eos> Which is the same reason it'll hold him in.<eos> If the Ghost Rider lands here, how do we get him in the cage?<eos> We have to lure him in.<eos> - Bait?<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> I'm faster than you.

As long as everything goes perfectly and he doesn't escape and kill us all.<eos> And your transformer works and the whole place doesn't catch on fire.<eos> And there isn't a catastrophic solar flare.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> He has third degree burns over 90% of his body.<eos> I should be telling you to say your goodbyes.<eos> It's Peter.<eos> I don't need to say goodbyes.<eos> I need you to fix him so we can find out what he knows about the Wild Hunt.
I need you to fix him so we can find out what he knows about the Wild Hunt.<eos> Remember who we're dealing with.<eos> Your father is a ruthless con man who always has a devious plan to hurt everyone around him.<eos> What happens when he gets up out of that bed?<eos> You got a plan of your own?<eos> I have a plan.<eos> I don't know if it's devious.<eos> At least it's a plan.<eos> I can't promise this will work.<eos> You said he was dying anyway.
I can't promise this will work.<eos> You said he was dying anyway.<eos> What does he have to lose?<eos> I can hear you.<eos> I'm not dead yet.<eos> I think they put that there to protect me.<eos> Glad to see you're obeying hospital protocols.<eos> Your daughter asked me to treat you.<eos> In exchange for what?<eos> Told you, you needed a plan.

To fill the void she felt after the Wild Hunt passed through Canaan.<eos> Mom...<eos> What if Sheriff Stilinski is filling a void?<eos> What if he's filling it with Claudia?<eos> You think Claudia's dead?<eos> No, I... I just saw her.<eos> So many things don't make sense.<eos> She had a fatal disease, but then she's fine.<eos> She says her Jeep was stolen 20 years ago, but it's Stiles'.<eos> Oh, you should have seen the look on her face when I peeled back the wallpaper.
She says her Jeep was stolen 20 years ago, but it's Stiles'.<eos> Oh, you should have seen the look on her face when I peeled back the wallpaper.<eos> She wasn't just angry.<eos> She was scared.<eos> Like she was protecting a secret.<eos> Okay.<eos> If this is true, then... Maybe Sheriff Stilinski needs this.<eos> Maybe it's his way of coping.<eos> What if Claudia being here is preventing him from remembering Stiles?<eos> Lydia, if Claudia isn't real, you don't want to be the one to tell him.

Go!<eos> It worked.<eos> We did it.<eos> Yeah. We did.<eos> You knew about it, didn't you?
We did it.<eos> Yeah. We did.<eos> You knew about it, didn't you?<eos> God, it was on the blueprints.<eos> It was here when we moved in.<eos> That was 18 years ago.<eos> Lydia?<eos> What is it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I don't understand how you knew this was here.

I'm listening.
Nothing's gonna scare this thing.<eos> Look at him. He's a walking corpse.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> Why'd he stop trying to get out?<eos> Did he just call for backup?<eos> When Corey made the Ghost Rider visible at the party, another one showed up.<eos> We have to figure out how to talk to him. Or else get the hell out of here.<eos> Where's Corey?<eos> He's over there.<eos> How did you know?

I think that he was actually trying to communicate with him.<eos> On your knees.<eos> On your knees.<eos> We need Parrish.<eos> So, wait a sec.<eos> So, this woman "Lenore," she conjured up her dead son?<eos> She was the only one left.<eos> She had to fill a void.<eos> So she filled it with her son.<eos> And you saw this kid?
We all did.<eos> He was real.<eos> He was there.<eos> But...<eos> But what?<eos> She was there when everybody was taken.<eos> She saw it happen.<eos> But she didn't wanna believe it.<eos> She wanted to believe in her son.<eos> What are you trying to say?

Tell us how we get everyone back.<eos> What was that?<eos> Did he say something?<eos> He said "Hellhound".<eos> Is that a good thing?<eos> Take the next left, cut over to the highway.<eos> And then don't stop.<eos> We have a deal.<eos> I'm not leaving without Stiles.<eos> You're so very loyal, Malia.

I'm comin' for my friends.<eos> I'm comin' for everyone.<eos> I won't stop.<eos> I'll never stop until we get everyone back.<eos> Parrish?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Scott...<eos> What is he doing?<eos> He's gonna set him free.<eos> I think you need to admit that you have an unhealthy attachment to Stiles.

You got to let him go.<eos> Would you please try to behave like a human?<eos> I need Stiles for that.<eos> Why? Is he your human crutch?<eos> He's my anchor.<eos> I'll get you a new anchor.<eos> He's not comin' back.<eos> He was hunted.<eos> He got caught.<eos> You don't believe that.

You can't just poke around and expect to find a supernatural train station.<eos> Do you hear that?
You wanted us to know about Stiles.<eos> And Canaan.<eos> You were warning us.<eos> This is where we found you.<eos> Like I said, there's nothin' here.<eos> You're not even looking. You can't just poke around and expect to find a supernatural train station.<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Same here.<eos> How do you think it's going?
Have you been here the whole time?<eos> How could I stay away?<eos> Maybe you should tell them who you really are.<eos> Hauptmann?<eos> It's them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And judging by the sound, we don't have a lot of time.<eos> For what?<eos> For you to run.<eos> You're leaving me?
But if we can hear them, it must be close.<eos> There'll be another chance.<eos> Go now.<eos> Malia, run!<eos> Go!<eos> Break the barrier.<eos> Break the barrier, or I'll rip you in two.<eos> It's been a long time.<eos> Don't follow me.<eos> What did you do?
Give the boy some room.<eos> Dad?<eos> Dad?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, I found you.<eos> I can't believe I found you.<eos> Dad, I can hear Lydia.<eos> I think... I think I can get to her.<eos> I think she can get us out of here.<eos> You need to get out of here.
Dad?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, I found you.<eos> I can't believe I found you.<eos> Dad, I can hear Lydia.<eos> I think... I think I can get to her.<eos> I think she can get us out of here.<eos> You need to get out of here.<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> - What, you're kidding, right?
It was working.<eos> You saw him, right?<eos> We didn't see anyone.<eos> No.<eos> He was here.<eos> I know it.<eos> Stiles was here.<eos> Liam...<eos> - There's something you need to see.<eos> - You're still here.
He was here.<eos> I know it.<eos> Stiles was here.<eos> Liam...<eos> - There's something you need to see.<eos> - You're still here.<eos> But everyone else is gone.<eos> All of them.<eos> They're all gone.<eos> - Look, you have to come with me.
I can't explain it.<eos> I have to show you.<eos> Uh, all right.<eos> You guys stay here.<eos> Just in case. In case Stiles Ecomes back?<eos> If there's any hope, you need to keep trying.<eos> Scott?<eos> Scott.<eos> Scott?<eos> What are you doing?
If there's any hope, you need to keep trying.<eos> Scott?<eos> Scott.<eos> Scott?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're gonna go find Stiles.<eos> Scott told us to stay in case he shows up here.<eos> Stiles isn't coming here.<eos> If he was, he would've, and he hasn't, so he's not.<eos> You still think it worked, right?

Without his keys?<eos> Well, half the time he got it started with a screwdriver.<eos> Then he's here.<eos> We have to tell Scott.<eos> We should probably tell Scott about that, too.<eos> He can't take both of us?<eos> No way.<eos> Hollenhund.<eos> Parrish.<eos> Parrish, you don't wanna do this.
We should probably tell Scott about that, too.<eos> He can't take both of us?<eos> No way.<eos> Hollenhund.<eos> Parrish.<eos> Parrish, you don't wanna do this.<eos> Stop!<eos> The train is coming, boys.<eos> There's no stopping the Wild Hunt.<eos> You'll make a fine Ghost Rider, Scott.
Corey.<eos> How many rooms does this place have?<eos> Beyond the 57 we've already searched?<eos> Probably enough for all of Beacon Hills.<eos> We're never gonna find him.<eos> Just keep looking.<eos> Attention, all passengers.<eos> The train will be arriving in 19 minutes.<eos> Okay, we're running out of time.<eos> - Mason. You always know where he is.

But you find him eventually.<eos> Just clear your mind, focus.<eos> Attention, all passengers.<eos> The train will be arriving in 19 minutes.<eos> It's him.<eos> Can't believe I'm gone a couple days, the whole place falls apart.<eos> No, you were gone for three months.<eos> I was...<eos> What? Okay, if they don't let me graduate, I swear to God...<eos> - What are you looking for?
No, you were gone for three months.<eos> I was...<eos> What? Okay, if they don't let me graduate, I swear to God...<eos> - What are you looking for?<eos> And him.<eos> Grab him.<eos> Grab him now.<eos> Okay.<eos> - God, ow!<eos> - Liam, you're fine.
- What are you looking for?<eos> And him.<eos> Grab him.<eos> Grab him now.<eos> Okay.<eos> - God, ow!<eos> - Liam, you're fine.<eos> God, that doesn't feel good.<eos> You know? Stiles?<eos> What are you doing here?
Grab him.<eos> Grab him now.<eos> Okay.<eos> - God, ow!<eos> - Liam, you're fine.<eos> God, that doesn't feel good.<eos> You know? Stiles?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Buddy, love you, but we're way past that, okay?<eos> You gotta fill us in.
What if that's how Douglas is doing it?<eos> What if Corey's the key?<eos> Interesting theory, okay?<eos> Solid logic. It is, but he's in there and we're out here.<eos> So the only way to save everyone now is to just divert the train.<eos> We have to find him.<eos> How?<eos> I'm going into the Hunt.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Liam, I think you're confused, we're trying to get people out of the Hunt.
How?<eos> I'm going into the Hunt.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Liam, I think you're confused, we're trying to get people out of the Hunt.<eos> He can get taken by a Ghost Rider.<eos> It's just... That's not a pleasant option.<eos> I'm speaking from experience.<eos> I don't need to get taken to get into the Hunt.<eos> Okay. Seems like you got an idea, let's disc...<eos> Where are you going?
I don't need to get taken to get into the Hunt.<eos> Okay. Seems like you got an idea, let's disc...<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Were we like that?<eos> Worse.<eos> - We just have to follow the tracks?<eos> - Yeah, well... Those lead into the woods.<eos> This way back into school.<eos> You wanna split up?
Worse.<eos> - We just have to follow the tracks?<eos> - Yeah, well... Those lead into the woods.<eos> This way back into school.<eos> You wanna split up?<eos> Never again.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I hate horses.<eos> Nice horse...<eos> Hey, you made it out!
You wanna split up?<eos> Never again.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I hate horses.<eos> Nice horse...<eos> Hey, you made it out!<eos> Yeah, barely!<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Uh, steal the horse and get to the Hunt.<eos> You're kidding, right?
Nice horse...<eos> Hey, you made it out!<eos> Yeah, barely!<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Uh, steal the horse and get to the Hunt.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> I went through all this to keep you from being taken. You need a hand?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Then go already!<eos> You know how to ride a horse?
- Malia.<eos> - What? The only way we were able to break through the Hunt is with an emotional connection.<eos> Dang.<eos> Wish I could help.<eos> I'm not saying it.<eos> I'm not saying it.<eos> Okay, well, I guess everyone dies.<eos> Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> - Dad. - Say it like you mean it.
I'm not saying it.<eos> Okay, well, I guess everyone dies.<eos> Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> - Dad. - Say it like you mean it.<eos> Dad.<eos> Please wake up.<eos> Dad.<eos> The train will be arriving in 17 minutes.<eos> Are you sure it's him?
The train will be arriving in 17 minutes.<eos> Are you sure it's him?<eos> I know his smile, I know his touch... And I know that that's his voice.<eos> It has to come from somewhere.<eos> Mason.<eos> We have to go.<eos> Just give me a minute, I can find it... We don't have a minute.<eos> They're coming.<eos> Liam?<eos> When did you learn how to ride a horse?
Nope, not easy at all.<eos> Attention, all passengers, the train will be arriving in 12 minutes.<eos> Me?<eos> You want me to stop them?<eos> You know how many there are?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A lot of them. So get going.<eos> There are hundreds of waiting rooms in this train station which apparently now also serves as a high school library.<eos> - It's impossible.<eos> - We can try. Where do you get this implausible optimism?
There are hundreds of waiting rooms in this train station which apparently now also serves as a high school library.<eos> - It's impossible.<eos> - We can try. Where do you get this implausible optimism?<eos> Definitely not from my father.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> We need someone to just hear us.<eos> I think we already did.<eos> Stiles?<eos> Damn! Man!<eos> Are you okay?
- I don't know.<eos> I think the worlds...<eos> I think they're collapsing in on each other.<eos> Attention, all passengers.<eos> The train will be arriving in 11 minutes.<eos> - We gotta get back to the diverter.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Get behind me.<eos> They won't take a Banshee.<eos> You sure about that?
The train will be arriving in nine minutes.<eos> Attention, all passengers.<eos> The train will be arriving in eight minutes.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Scott, I can't fight this guy.<eos> I didn't say it back.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> God!<eos> They're all sealed shut.<eos> Bet you wouldn't mind having a werewolf around right now... to rip them off their hinges.
God!<eos> They're all sealed shut.<eos> Bet you wouldn't mind having a werewolf around right now... to rip them off their hinges.<eos> Like to have one around for another reason right now.<eos> Get back.<eos> I gotta get me one of these.<eos> Argent!<eos> - What was that for?<eos> - That was so hot.<eos> I'd almost say you enjoy this, Scott.
I gotta get me one of these.<eos> Argent!<eos> - What was that for?<eos> - That was so hot.<eos> I'd almost say you enjoy this, Scott.<eos> The pursuit of utterly futile endeavors.<eos> Step back from the diverter.<eos> Or I'll make you step back.<eos> Now that's the German way of doing things.<eos> You would've made an excellent Nazi Youth.

Is that you?<eos> Mom?<eos> Stiles, that's not your mom.<eos> I know who it is.<eos> I know her voice. No, that's the Wild Hunt.<eos> They're tricking you.<eos> Stiles, please believe me.<eos> The Wild Hunt brought her back, but she's not real.<eos> What do you mean "brought her back?" Stiles.<eos> I know what you've been through.
Mom?<eos> Stiles, that's not your mom.<eos> I know who it is.<eos> I know her voice. No, that's the Wild Hunt.<eos> They're tricking you.<eos> Stiles, please believe me.<eos> The Wild Hunt brought her back, but she's not real.<eos> What do you mean "brought her back?" Stiles.<eos> I know what you've been through.<eos> I know how much you love your father.
But I love him more.<eos> Okay, we need to unplug him.<eos> We need to just get him out of this thing.<eos> I'll start with the big one.<eos> I'll pull it quick.<eos> It'll hurt, but Corey can heal.<eos> We can't.<eos> Not until Scott diverts the train.<eos> If we stop the merging, Scott won't be able to find the diverter.<eos> You wanna just leave him like this?
We need to do something.<eos> Not yet...<eos> You have to try to save everyone.<eos> How do we save you?<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Even in the face of insurmountable odds.<eos> I don't know if it's suicide or stupidity.<eos> Maybe both.<eos> Either way, I'm getting to that diverter.<eos> You of all people, Scott, should know what happens to a lone wolf.
You of all people, Scott, should know what happens to a lone wolf.<eos> He's not alone.<eos> He's got a pack.<eos> And Theo's not in it.<eos> But I am.<eos> I'm not in the pack.<eos> But no one likes a Nazi.<eos> Your little friends are no match for the Wild Hunt.<eos> There are too many of us and too few of you.<eos> Even from the Hunt, you somehow wormed your way back into his memory.
But I am.<eos> I'm not in the pack.<eos> But no one likes a Nazi.<eos> Your little friends are no match for the Wild Hunt.<eos> There are too many of us and too few of you.<eos> Even from the Hunt, you somehow wormed your way back into his memory.<eos> Yeah, worming is one of my skills.<eos> That thing is conjured from your dad's pain.<eos> If he remembers you, he can't believe in her.<eos> That's why you have to go.

Kill them.<eos> All of them.<eos> Tote sie.<eos> Tote sie.<eos> Riders don't bow.<eos> They have no leader.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can you fix this?<eos> Oh, she knows what she's doing. Have you ever heard of the Nine Herbs?
Well, there's the whole graduation thing.<eos> I've gotta go to summer school or I can't do the whole graduation thing.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> No. Come on, wait...<eos> Guys?<eos> This can't be it.<eos> I can't believe we're not in high school anymore.<eos> Kind of feels like nothing's really changed.<eos> Everything's changed.<eos> Okay! So, Liam, since you're the new Alpha...
Guys?<eos> This can't be it.<eos> I can't believe we're not in high school anymore.<eos> Kind of feels like nothing's really changed.<eos> Everything's changed.<eos> Okay! So, Liam, since you're the new Alpha...<eos> I'm not an Alpha.<eos> Right, but, you know, Alpha-in-training.<eos> Well, I'd have to kill an Alpha.<eos> Since you're taking over, the most important thing you can remember is that Mason is always gonna be the one who's there to save your ass all the time.
Which is why...<eos> I think you're gonna need this.<eos> Uh, I don't play baseball.<eos> Right, neither do I. It's...<eos> It's not the point.<eos> - Okay. Thanks.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> Love you guys.<eos> Right. I leave you with this.<eos> You know, hurt her and I'll kill you.

She wants to help me move into my dorm, so...<eos> You know she's starting MIT as a Junior?<eos> - How do you even do that?<eos> - I...<eos> She's a genius. Real question is how'd you get into UC Davis?<eos> How did you get into George Washington?
- How do you even do that?<eos> - I...<eos> She's a genius. Real question is how'd you get into UC Davis?<eos> How did you get into George Washington?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, your dad. The, uh, big FBI pops made a call to the little pre-FBI program.<eos> Pre-FBI.<eos> Well, I guess we're not the same kids running around the woods looking for a body.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> You know, you can keep the Jeep.

Well, that's one to your house, another to your room, uh, it's the master key to the school, Animal Clinic, key to the Sheriff's station.<eos> Just figured you should have all the copies I secretly made. So... Yeah.

Ah, fuck, mmm, yoga pants.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Chacho, let's go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Suspect's in black Chevy.<eos> We got him.<eos> Whoa!<eos> - Holy shit!<eos> What the fuck was that?<eos> - What are you stopping for?

It's like Santa shot Rudolph after all the deliveries, you know?<eos> You're a funny motherfucker, Chacho.<eos> That's cold, dude.<eos> That's fucking cold, dude.<eos> Let's go, let's go.<eos> You gotta get in the back.<eos> - It's supposed to look like a fare.<eos> - Just go!<eos> Not like a cabbie with his homie riding' in the front.<eos> You gotta get in the back.
Chacho.<eos> No, it's Castillo.<eos> Agent Castillo.<eos> I know, It's a bummer, right?<eos> Look at those guys.<eos> Whoa!<eos> I took you on vacation to the Bahamas with my family.<eos> It was great.<eos> I loved it.<eos> You fucking piece of shit!

His name was Michael Glade.<eos> Hey, keep still.<eos> Easy.<eos> Nobody shoot.<eos> Don't move, Chacho!<eos> I'm shot!<eos> Oh, that felt so good!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> I was praying to God, I was, like,<eos> "Please give me a reason to shoot you." And you came through, bro!

They're on the ramp, TJ. Two bikes.<eos> Dispatch, this is EAGLE-6.<eos> We have four suspects on two black motorcycles heading eastbound toward Pennsylvania Ave.<eos> Shots fired, shots fired!<eos> Let's see how much your boyfriend loves you.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> He's got David.<eos> - Who's David?<eos> One of you is gonna die.<eos> You choose, thief.

What's your job?<eos> Find the five dirty cops.<eos> That's right.<eos> Blend in.<eos> Hey!<eos> What's up?<eos> I'm Jon.<eos> Jon Baker.<eos> Francis, uh, Poncherello.<eos> - Oh, you're Poncherello?
- Awesome, man.<eos> We're partners.<eos> - Oh, cool.<eos> Let's kick this off with the real thing.<eos> Oh, dude!<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Slow down a little bit.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - That was a bit much.<eos> If you're homophobic or whatever, that's cool.
Oh, dude!<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Slow down a little bit.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - That was a bit much.<eos> If you're homophobic or whatever, that's cool.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> What?<eos> I mean, it's not cool to be homophobic, but I totally respect your right to be.<eos> Wait, you think I'm homophobic because I won't embrace a man in his underpants that I just met?
If you're homophobic or whatever, that's cool.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> What?<eos> I mean, it's not cool to be homophobic, but I totally respect your right to be.<eos> Wait, you think I'm homophobic because I won't embrace a man in his underpants that I just met?<eos> But your reaction was really strong. Borderline violent.<eos> I bet if I were a hot woman in a bikini, you'd probably be fine hugging me, yeah?<eos> Your question is, "Would I prefer to hug a hot woman in a bikini "over a male stranger in his underpants?"<eos> And my answer to that will determine whether or not I'm a homophobe, like, according to you?<eos> I think you've oversimplified it, but yes.

Understood?
I'm trying to salvage my marriage--<eos> Did I ask you about your failing marriage?<eos> No.<eos> Just shut up and suit up, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> No way.<eos> Come on, Jon Baker. "The Baker"?<eos> Hey, what's going on, dude?<eos> Brian Grieves.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?
- Oh, God.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He was amazing.<eos> I wish he would've stuck with it.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, hey, look, man, welcome.<eos> I cannot wait to work with you.<eos> - Oh, man. Do you ride?

Who has a fire extinguisher in their car at this very moment as we speak?<eos> Gotta say this is pretty badass, yeah?<eos> Being all suited up for battle.<eos> What, looking like UPS drivers?<eos> Yeah, that's super cool.<eos> Fuckin' go brown, right?<eos> We don't look like UPS drivers.<eos> Hold up a second.<eos> It's Roth.<eos> - You find out where she works?
- On Riverside.<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, hey!<eos> How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> Is that your Sport 1000 I'm seeing?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know what that is?
- Ah...<eos> Just a little bit.<eos> I got a Paul Smart 1000 myself.<eos> Oh, I love those. Those are beautiful.<eos> So beautiful. I've been looking for one of yours for a while, though.<eos> - Car wash in the Valley?<eos> - Yeah. Happy Hands.<eos> Okay.<eos> Send me the address.<eos> If you're interested, you should ride up Angeles Crest with us to Newcomb's Ranch.

Is your friend ticketing me?<eos> - One down.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Jon. What are you doing?<eos> - What am I doing?<eos> - What is this shit?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This car doesn't have plates.<eos> No, because it's brand new.<eos> Can you not see it's brand new?

Okay.<eos> Listen, I have one shot at saving my marriage, okay?<eos> This job is crucial to that.<eos> I couldn't care less about your wife, but stay with the bikes, okay?<eos> And don't ticket anybody.<eos> Okay, and fuck that.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I'm not letting my partner fly solo into an unknown environment.<eos> You're not going let me or not let me do a damn thing.

I got to go visit LT.<eos> Who's LT?<eos> Just a mutual friend.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Get outta there.<eos> Get outta there, dude!<eos> - Huh?<eos> Get outta there.<eos> Jesus.<eos> - I hope you got closure in there.
- Get outta there.<eos> Get outta there, dude!<eos> - Huh?<eos> Get outta there.<eos> Jesus.<eos> - I hope you got closure in there.<eos> - Closure?<eos> Yeah, because I almost lost it when that cat went face-first into the litter box. Ugh!<eos> What kind of dude uses the word "closure"?<eos> - What, are you a therapist?
- I hope you got closure in there.<eos> - Closure?<eos> Yeah, because I almost lost it when that cat went face-first into the litter box. Ugh!<eos> What kind of dude uses the word "closure"?<eos> - What, are you a therapist?<eos> - No.<eos> But I've been in couples' therapy for a year. And that's what it's called when you try to resolve painful feelings.<eos> - I could tell.<eos> - Isn't that why we're here?<eos> So you could process the passing of your friend?

Your buddy's been dead how long?<eos> You still haven't dealt with it?<eos> He's been dead a month, Freud.<eos> - A month?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That's weird.<eos> - What's weird?<eos> It's weird that his wife moved on in a month.<eos> In your expertise, she's moved on.<eos> How can you tell?
- Yeah.<eos> Huh?<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Hey, Roth?<eos> Yeah, what's up?<eos> Find out if TJ owned another property, like a rented or leased.<eos> No problem.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Huh?<eos> Why are you in front of my partner's house?

Oh, just giving my condolences.<eos> - You knew TJ?<eos> - Yup.<eos> The Academy.<eos> Really?<eos> What year was that exactly?<eos> Why are you shaking me down, man?<eos> First at lunch and now here?<eos> I mean, I was friends with TJ.<eos> All right? We were friends and I thought we'd get along too. But if you're going to be up my ass, then I'll just keep it movin'.

You haven't even seen it.
It's a big V-twin.<eos> Yeah, but a lot of people make twins.<eos> Yeah, but that one's revving at 9000 RPM which only a four-valve motor will do.<eos> The only four-valve twin in a supermoto setup is the Ducati.<eos> They're fast as fuck.<eos> All I wanna do in the middle of the evening is hold you tight<eos> Rosanna, Rosanna<eos> Hey, Jon.<eos> Can I tell you something?<eos> It was pretty impressive the way you were able to peg those bikes back there.

Pull over!<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Rock beats scissors.<eos> Jon, stop!<eos> - One second.<eos> - Stop!<eos> That's an order!<eos> - License and registration.<eos> - What are you doing, boy?<eos> Could you not see what I was holding up?
Could you not see what I was holding up?<eos> Okay.<eos> Lower the music, please.<eos> "CHP Widows' Fund Gold Donor." What is this?<eos> Are you a widow?<eos> - Hey!<eos> - One second!<eos> - Turn down the music!<eos> - Please turn it down.<eos> If you keep ignoring me, I'm going to write you up for insubordination.

He's old, and he's fragile.<eos> Stop fucking jerking on him.<eos> - No, you are!

Hey.<eos> Get outta here.<eos> We question the guard from the armored truck.<eos> After you interview Barton, find out if someone named "LT" works here.<eos> Barton's been MIA since--<eos> Don't tell him shit.<eos> Who's "LT"?<eos> He's the shot caller.<eos> I heard it from one of the witnesses.<eos> You're talking to witnesses now?

There's no way Baker could be IA.<eos> He was a fucking X-Games guy a few years back.<eos> - You don't like it.<eos> - No, I don't like it.<eos> My son's addicted to heroin.<eos> I got to get him out of this fucking town.<eos> It's the only way he's ever going to get clean.<eos> Let's just figure out another way to move the money.<eos> And try to fly with cash?<eos> You kidding me?
- All right, well, then fuck it.<eos> Even if they do show up, they'll be riding lawnmowers.<eos> Search Bob Lin. L-I-N.<eos> All right.<eos> Oof! Asian as hell.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi, what's up?<eos> I'm right in the middle of giving a swim lesson.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> What are you wearing?
Hi, what's up?<eos> I'm right in the middle of giving a swim lesson.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> What are you wearing?<eos> Oh, it's my uniform.<eos> From the CHP.<eos> Aren't you supposed to change out of it after you get off work?<eos> Yeah, you can.<eos> Most guys probably...<eos> It was my first day, so I thought you'd probably want to see what I look like.

Can you do that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Hey, Jon!<eos> Hey, Rick.<eos> You working down at UPS now?<eos> No, man, I'm a police officer.<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> Hey, uh, can we get a to-go box?<eos> It's for your shirt, bro, so you can eat it later.
You working down at UPS now?<eos> No, man, I'm a police officer.<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> Hey, uh, can we get a to-go box?<eos> It's for your shirt, bro, so you can eat it later.<eos> - Classic Ponch-y.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Always deflecting!<eos> Oh, deflecting.<eos> Why don't you stop using that word?

Always deflecting!<eos> Oh, deflecting.<eos> Why don't you stop using that word?<eos> Do you even know what the word means?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Because I got a great example for you.<eos> Okay, give me an example.<eos> It's when a guy is super embarrassed about taking his third dump before 11:00 a.m. So he makes fun of his partner's shirt.<eos> Deflecting.<eos> Okay, why are you counting how many times I go to the bathroom?

I'm worried about you.<eos> Is there any blood?<eos> Fucking blood.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> We're going to talk about this.<eos> Dude, I will run in and get you some Imodium if you're ashamed, okay?<eos> Take the olive branch and accept some help, okay?<eos> Come on, Ponch!<eos> Ponch, slow down.<eos> You're not good enough to ride this fast.

Ponch, slow down.<eos> You're not good enough to ride this fast.<eos> I'd rather crash and die than talk to you.<eos> You clearly have a health issue, like Crohn's or colitis.<eos> I won't bring it up again. Just, please, slow down.<eos> I don't have colitis, and there's other goddamn reasons for going to the bathroom!<eos> Yeah, but for 20 minutes?<eos> Even a prostate thing would be like, uh...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Are you stroking yourself three times a day in communal bathrooms?

- I'll stay out of it.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> But, if something did happen...<eos> I just want you to hear me. It's not your fault.<eos> - Nothing happened, bro.<eos> - It's not your fault.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> - Are you positive?<eos> - I'm positive.<eos> If anything, you should worry about your shit.

Armed suspects fleeing on motorcycles.<eos> Oh, oh, oh, come on, come on.<eos> It's three exits over.<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> I'm sorry, come on!<eos> Help me with the bike!<eos> God damn it.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> All right, go around me.<eos> You won't make it.
Come on, let's go!<eos> I'm sorry, come on!<eos> Help me with the bike!<eos> God damn it.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> All right, go around me.<eos> You won't make it.<eos> Bullshit!<eos> I can ride.<eos> You crashed eight minutes ago on flat pavement.
Different cops?<eos> They're heading south on Stadium Way.<eos> I'm on Stadium Way.<eos> Where are you guys?<eos> Stop!<eos> I said "Stop"!<eos> Stop, motherfuckers!<eos> Great job!<eos> I'm not gonna empty my weapon without cause.<eos> If this was a public bathroom, you'd be shootin' your weapon all over the place.

Wake up! What is your status?<eos> 7-MARY-3, shut the fuck up.<eos> I don't see 'em.<eos> - You got 'em?

My guy at the Bureau says there's a panel on him and his name is Castillo, not Poncherello.<eos> - Oh, shit, Baker's calling me.<eos> - Ignore it.<eos> Yeah, dispatch.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Uh, it's Officer Jon Baker, and I was wondering if you could patch me through to Ava Perez.<eos> It's an emergency.<eos> So, let me get this straight.<eos> You thought it was inappropriate to go on a motorcycle ride together and now, I'm supposed to come over to your bedroom, help you from your bed into your bathtub so you can pop some pills and loosen up?

Ava?<eos> There was no record of an "LT" working at All Steel, but I did get a hit on that property search for TJ.<eos> Turns out they filed an eviction notice yesterday for an apartment he cosigned on.<eos> Oh, nice.<eos> Text me the address.<eos> Buddy.<eos> Oh, my God, dude. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this.<eos> I thought I was gonna have to call 911 or something.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Do you need water?

Oh, body's a little sore, but I'm okay.<eos> They just discharged me.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Yeah, I was kind of scared when I saw your car Frisbee like that.<eos> But, I'm glad you're all right.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Jon's in...<eos> Oh, yeah, that's right.<eos> Okay, cool.<eos> Text me when you get home?
Photographic evidence?<eos> Fuck, yeah.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Ooh, Nice toes.<eos> Wait, slow down.<eos> Slower, slower.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Just a little bit.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> I didn't know you had those.
Oh!<eos> - Oh! Oh!<eos> - What was that sexy scream?<eos> Oh! Oh! Oh!<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Someone prematurely ejaculated.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Can you manage?
Oh!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Someone prematurely ejaculated.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Can you manage?<eos> - Got it.<eos> Last one.<eos> So, what's the plan now, babe?<eos> The second Brian gets out of the hospital, you, Cooper, and Hansen, you head up to Big Bear.
Oh, no.<eos> Someone prematurely ejaculated.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> - Can you manage?<eos> - Got it.<eos> Last one.<eos> So, what's the plan now, babe?<eos> The second Brian gets out of the hospital, you, Cooper, and Hansen, you head up to Big Bear.<eos> You wait for the Brunei flight. You get the painting and get out of there.

You get the painting and get out of there.<eos> And until then?<eos> Business as usual.<eos> They only know me.<eos> Ray, I'm really sorry about, um...<eos> Do you want to talk about him?
No, I do not.<eos> Maybe after I take care of your little boyfriend.<eos> So, he brings in a goat and a donkey...<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> When I am healed, I am gonna physically destroy you.<eos> Get the fuck out of my room. Call Peterson.<eos> He's looking for you.<eos> My phone's broken.<eos> I can't.<eos> You torpedo the entire case, and you broke your phone.
You ever been in a scissor hold, motherfucker?<eos> Huh?<eos> There he is.<eos> - Hey. - Hey.<eos> Where's your breathing tube?<eos> That was a really sexy look for you.<eos> I also have a catheter in and I didn't wanna be too sexy for the staff.<eos> Mmm-hmm, yeah.<eos> Tone it down a little bit.<eos> Are you posted here?

So flattering.<eos> I was wondering, when you get discharged, if you wanted to, um,<eos> take a ride back home with me?<eos> I'm available.<eos> I already left my wife a message, and I'm pretty sure she's gonna pick me up.<eos> Is this the same wife that hasn't been here once?<eos> You haven't met her.

Oh!<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Oh, Ponch!<eos> Man, am I happy to see you!<eos> I'm sorry about this.<eos> I just got my phone working.<eos> I got all your messages.<eos> Dude, I'm so happy you're here.<eos> - Good to see you, buddy.<eos> - Thank you for coming.
I just got my phone working.<eos> I got all your messages.<eos> Dude, I'm so happy you're here.<eos> - Good to see you, buddy.<eos> - Thank you for coming.<eos> I'm really sorry, man.<eos> I would've been here when you woke up, but I was buying a new phone.<eos> No, man, it's good.<eos> I'm all good.<eos> What do you mean, you're good?

Yeah, but my titanium humerus took most of the hit.<eos> It was only a five.<eos> Five out of what?<eos> Out of ten.<eos> - Then what's a 10?<eos> - Scrotal tear, which I've had.<eos> Nuts unravel down your leg. It's gruesome.<eos> - What?<eos> - I know.<eos> - You sexted with Captain Lindel?
We're moving in.<eos> Are you my neighbor?<eos> I'm Amy.<eos> You're moving into my house, though.<eos> So, no, I'm not your neighbor.<eos> This is my house.<eos> No, this was Karen and Rick's house, and now it's my house because I bought it.<eos> What's wrong, not enough chili?<eos> No, I'm just not very hungry.<eos> Dude, I know you love Karen, but can I just say one thing about her?

Okay.<eos> She's a dick.<eos> Like, end of story.<eos> I actually figured out why you're so hell-bent on keeping her.<eos> Yeah?<eos> She's the only thing left of your glory days.<eos> You know?<eos> Like, the money's gone. Fans are gone.<eos> Now, the house.<eos> She's like that last bit of proof that it even happened and I think you're afraid that if you lose her, you've officially lost it all.

Fans are gone.<eos> Now, the house.<eos> She's like that last bit of proof that it even happened and I think you're afraid that if you lose her, you've officially lost it all.<eos> Wow.<eos> For a guy who won't say the word "closure," that was a pretty profound observation.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Goddamn you, Ponch-y.<eos> I'm tired now.<eos> I wish you would've told me this five years ago.
- That's Ray's son!<eos> No, we go!<eos> We leave.<eos> We go?<eos> Okay.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Slow down.<eos> Captain Lindel.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What took you so long?
Captain Lindel.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> No!<eos> - No, this is not what it's about.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I was gonna say the head in the helmet, that's Ray's son and Brian Grieves is his nephew, who's in the hospital.<eos> And we need to send people over to get him in custody ASAP.<eos> Also, I need a gun, and I need to be sworn in as an officer of the California Highway Patrol.<eos> But you're an FBI agent?

I get it.<eos> But can you swear me in?<eos> I'll swear you in if you sexy scream.<eos> No, just swear me in, please.<eos> - Please?<eos> - You know the oath?<eos> When we get to the hospital, we do all the questioning, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> "Come now, just you and your partner."
- Please?<eos> - You know the oath?<eos> When we get to the hospital, we do all the questioning, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> "Come now, just you and your partner."<eos> What's that?<eos> Look at this.<eos> Are you sexting with Karen?<eos> No, you idiot!
She's being held hostage.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Okay. He dropped a pin.<eos> That's where she's at.<eos> That's across the street from the Devil's Punchbowl.<eos> We gotta take the bikes.<eos> Wait! Let's just think about this.<eos> Why are we gonna risk our life to save your dirtbag ex-wife's?<eos> She stole your house.<eos> You kicked my weak knee, said my wife was fucking someone else, and I still saved your life.

There'll be a week's worth of provisions in the cabin.<eos> When should we expect you?<eos> You should not.<eos> All right, spoke with the nurse, says that he left with a super pretty CHP officer.<eos> So, it has to be Lindsey.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She's radio silent right now, but GPS has her car 12 miles east of Palmdale.<eos> Let's do it, folks.<eos> That is some cold shit, man, riding the dead son's bike.<eos> You kidnap my wife, I ride your dead son's bike.

How the fuck is that thing gaining on us?<eos> He's a fucking warlock, man!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I can't leave my uncle by himself.<eos> He told us to hide out in the cabin.<eos> He was very clear.<eos> You're free to do that, all right, but you're dropping me off first.
You're free to do that, all right, but you're dropping me off first.<eos> There's the Devil's Punchbowl.<eos> It's gotta be on the right.<eos> Here!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Looking for a chink in the armor.<eos> Oh, bingo!<eos> No, don't hit that!<eos> I can't jump!<eos> You can do it.

- Damn it!<eos> Fuck!<eos> - You okay?<eos> This way.<eos> Come on, she's over here.<eos> Okay, we're here.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Jon!<eos> Oh, thank God!<eos> I knew you'd come.
No, they're gone, dude!<eos> Hold on.<eos> Let me see if I can see them.<eos> Okay.<eos> I see them.<eos> Go get them.<eos> Okay, I'm going in.<eos> Oh, shit! Damn it!<eos> Here, put them in your pocket.<eos> There you go.
There's only two of them!<eos> - Huh?<eos> - There's only two!<eos> You're gonna have to make do! Two is enough!<eos> No! I want my fucking pinky!<eos> They're coming at us!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Ah! Jon!<eos> Get up, you fucking rat!
A fucking head for a head!<eos> Cover me!<eos> That was my son!<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Get up!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Take my gun.<eos> No.<eos> You're a better shot than me.
Like Jimi Hendrix-style, with my fucking teeth?<eos> Take it!<eos> Man up, Jon!<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What?<eos> Jesus, Jon!<eos> Just hit him, Jon!<eos> Okay, you're hitting 10º to the right.
Yeah, okay.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What?<eos> Jesus, Jon!<eos> Just hit him, Jon!<eos> Okay, you're hitting 10º to the right.<eos> You gotta aim 10º to the left, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Are you aimed 10º to the left?
You gotta aim 10º to the left, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Are you aimed 10º to the left?<eos> - Yeah, but...<eos> Fire!<eos> Ah!<eos> Dude, that was 10º.<eos> No, it wasn't!<eos> That was more like 20º.<eos> Dude, you think he's in one piece?
That was more like 20º.<eos> Dude, you think he's in one piece?<eos> Come on!<eos> Stay down!<eos> Give me your fucking arm!<eos> Stay down!<eos> What's your plan?<eos> The doors are all shut.<eos> Where we're going, we don't need doors.<eos> Is this the same hole you crashed into earlier?
Oh!<eos> Now!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> You didn't see that coming.<eos> Hot and helpful!<eos> See, it's not either or.<eos> Hey, Ray. How do those cuffs feel?<eos> Repeat the question.<eos> Go ahead!<eos> You're with this piece of shit?
Go ahead!<eos> You're with this piece of shit?<eos> Shut up!<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> You knew that I killed three of my co-workers, but you thought it was okay to kill my son?<eos> Uh-uh, uh-uh.<eos> No.<eos> Your beef's with the steel cable, not us.<eos> We were just chasing him.<eos> You weren't as good as Reed.

Oh, my God, dude!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Dude, that's a ricochet.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Stay down, gorgeous asshole!<eos> Dude, your arm is straight up titanium, like a Terminator's arm!<eos> Yeah.<eos> I told you.<eos> Oh, whoa.<eos> Do you feel this?
Dude, your arm is straight up titanium, like a Terminator's arm!<eos> Yeah.<eos> I told you.<eos> Oh, whoa.<eos> Do you feel this?<eos> Uh, yeah, a little bit.<eos> Like a two out of ten.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> - Get off of me!<eos> You feel this?
- Yeah, it's over here.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Back up, you're on Ponch's pinky!<eos> I saw a look on your face tonight I haven't seen in years, not since you competed.<eos> I can tell you really like this thing, being a cop.<eos> Yeah, I really do, maybe even more than riding.<eos> Do you want me to ride in the ambulance with you?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> You're kind of a dick.
I can tell you really like this thing, being a cop.<eos> Yeah, I really do, maybe even more than riding.<eos> Do you want me to ride in the ambulance with you?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> You're kind of a dick.<eos> I'm gonna ride with Ponch.<eos> Take care, Karen.<eos> Hey, you all right?<eos> Yeah, are you okay?<eos> You tackled her like crazy.
No, I'm good.<eos> You're kind of a dick.<eos> I'm gonna ride with Ponch.<eos> Take care, Karen.<eos> Hey, you all right?<eos> Yeah, are you okay?<eos> You tackled her like crazy.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I'm a fucking beast.<eos> Hey, do you wanna ride with us?

Um, excuse me, Ava?<eos> Uh, yes, Jon?<eos> I'm really sorry I didn't take that ride home with you from the hospital.<eos> That was just a very stupid decision.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I'm sorry I said mean things about your wife.<eos> Even if she is a piece of shit, it's just not nice.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You look a little short of breath.

Some video.<eos> A chick calls you on the phone after you watch it and says, "Seven days," which was, like, right now.<eos> Open up!<eos> Did you make a copy of it?<eos> Did you make a copy of the tape?<eos> No!<eos> I...<eos> - Miss, the seat belt light is on.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> What is going on with you?
No!<eos> I...<eos> - Miss, the seat belt light is on.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> It's just a story.<eos> I've seen it!<eos> Traffic control, this is Flight 77.<eos> We have some signal interference.<eos> If you're not interested in buying, I'd love to take a look.
Sure.<eos> I mean, who would want an old VCR?<eos> Well, once upon a time, this was a technological revolution.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just talking to the guy.<eos> It turns out that he got all this stuff from a family whose son died in a plane crash a couple of years back.<eos> And now it's just a bunch of outdated junk.<eos> I prefer "vintage."<eos> Come on, old man.<eos> You still got some life in you.
I prefer "vintage."<eos> Come on, old man.<eos> You still got some life in you.<eos> Hey, Skye?<eos> Guess what.<eos> What?<eos> Had a tape in it.<eos> Care to see what's down the rabbit hole?<eos> I'm gonna be late for class.<eos> But then, maybe you can tell me about it later.
Just...<eos> He tracks her down.<eos> All right? He finds her.<eos> And the Devil's gonna let her go on one condition.<eos> He has to start first, without her.<eos> He has to walk away without looking back at her.<eos> - He looks back to glimpse her and loses her forever.<eos> Ninth grade.<eos> - English Lit. - Okay.<eos> You know it.
- He looks back to glimpse her and loses her forever.<eos> Ninth grade.<eos> - English Lit. - Okay.<eos> You know it.<eos> So, what's your point?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just...<eos> I relate to the guy.<eos> I mean, I can't imagine not looking back at you.<eos> Actually, you got to go.
I relate to the guy.<eos> I mean, I can't imagine not looking back at you.<eos> Actually, you got to go.<eos> Because my boyfriend's leaving for college, and I promised I'd help him pack.<eos> - No!<eos> - Come on, get up.<eos> Baby, baby, baby, he's a loser.<eos> Come back to bed.<eos> Come back to bed, now.<eos> - You really need all this?
Come back to bed.<eos> Come back to bed, now.<eos> - You really need all this?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Come on, Holt!<eos> Supposed to be on the road an hour ago.<eos> Just give us a second, Dad.<eos> You're doing the right thing.
Just give us a second, Dad.<eos> You're doing the right thing.<eos> Your mom, she really needs you right now.<eos> I'm gonna miss your smell.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you Columbus Day weekend.<eos> And tell Tommy Lombardi that I'm on to him.<eos> What do you mean?
Your mom, she really needs you right now.<eos> I'm gonna miss your smell.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you Columbus Day weekend.<eos> And tell Tommy Lombardi that I'm on to him.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He gets a job where you work the day I leave?<eos> You're crazy!
9:30, Skype, tonight!<eos> - Where the hell is your shirt?<eos> - Tonight!<eos> - And every night!<eos> - And every single night!<eos> Unless I'm with Tommy Lombardi!<eos> You did not just say that!<eos> Baby, it's been six weeks.<eos> I can't take it.<eos> Why are you so much nicer now that we don't live in the same town?
- That's a weird name.<eos> How are your classes?<eos> Kind of uninspiring.<eos> There's this one Experimental Biology class, though.<eos> The teacher's kind of a badass.<eos> That sounds cool.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Not everything's cool, though.<eos> It's still, like, a whole week until I get to see you.<eos> Well, you're seeing me now.
What about I start by taking off my hairclip?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's next?<eos> "Take me, take me.<eos> I can't stand it!"<eos> How did you even get in here?<eos> These idiots just broke into my room.<eos> Come on, Vision Quest.<eos> Gabriel says you're up.
- You know, but we could talk.<eos> - I think I'm good.<eos> I'll make it up to you.<eos> I promise.<eos> - I'll talk to you tomorrow.<eos> - He'll talk to you...<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I told you I'd make it up to you.<eos> Julia...<eos> You owe me a good dream.
I'll make it up to you.<eos> I promise.<eos> - I'll talk to you tomorrow.<eos> - He'll talk to you...<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I told you I'd make it up to you.<eos> Julia...<eos> You owe me a good dream.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - Who are you?
Julia...<eos> You owe me a good dream.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> Where's Holt?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I haven't spoken to him in days.<eos> Don't lie to me!<eos> I'm not lying to you!<eos> What are you doing on his computer?
I don't know.<eos> I haven't spoken to him in days.<eos> Don't lie to me!<eos> I'm not lying to you!<eos> What are you doing on his computer?<eos> Tell him there's no hiding.<eos> Tell the dead man he can't hide.<eos> What...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What's wrong with you?
Let's remember the infamous double-slit experiment.<eos> When no one is watching, the particles just pass through both slits at the same time.<eos> But with an observer, they behave like bullets, passing through one slit or the other.<eos> This is big, guys.<eos> The immaterial human consciousness has reached out and touched the material.<eos> There is a calculable transformation in the real world, and solely because someone was there to watch it.<eos> Which may account for the fact that I have become significantly sweatier once I've noticed the mysterious stranger watching me from the back of the room.<eos> All right, that's it. Go get drunk.<eos> Hey, I remember you guys from...<eos> - Why'd you come here?
- I'm telling you, it's different.<eos> Everyone says that.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Where's your tail?<eos> I don't have one anymore.<eos> I told you not to call him.<eos> That asshole hung up on me!<eos> I wonder why.<eos> Okay. We'll switch tails.<eos> You talk to Holt?
That asshole hung up on me!<eos> I wonder why.<eos> Okay. We'll switch tails.<eos> You talk to Holt?<eos> No!<eos> I tried.<eos> He isn't answering his phone.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Holt has his own problems.<eos> You have to help me, Gabriel.
Okay. We'll switch tails.<eos> You talk to Holt?<eos> No!<eos> I tried.<eos> He isn't answering his phone.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Holt has his own problems.<eos> You have to help me, Gabriel.<eos> - It's your fault!<eos> You started this!
- It's your fault!<eos> You started this!<eos> - Calm down.<eos> Listen to me, Gabe!<eos> The videos, the tails, all these people.<eos> - It's wrong and she's pissed!<eos> - You're being ridiculous.<eos> I can feel her.<eos> It's all changing.<eos> You don't have much time.

Get to your studio.<eos> Don't talk to anyone along the way.<eos> Make a copy of the video and wait.<eos> I'm gonna send someone right now.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Everything's gonna be fine, darling.<eos> You understand?<eos> Yes!<eos> I understand!<eos> But you don't.
Make a copy of the video and wait.<eos> I'm gonna send someone right now.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> Everything's gonna be fine, darling.<eos> You understand?<eos> Yes!<eos> I understand!<eos> But you don't.<eos> I honestly didn't find the tape to be that scary, but...<eos> Hey, you're not supposed to be here!

I can help you.<eos> But I need to show you something first.<eos> You live here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fine Arts.<eos> Grad program.<eos> I need a clear head to do my work, and I like my privacy.<eos> Is Holt even here?<eos> Did I say he would be?<eos> Be careful where you step.
Grad program.<eos> I need a clear head to do my work, and I like my privacy.<eos> Is Holt even here?<eos> Did I say he would be?<eos> Be careful where you step.<eos> I just painted the ceiling.<eos> Nothing's wrong.<eos> He's not avoiding you.<eos> He's just on a journey.<eos> I want you to watch something and then you'll understand.

I need you to do this for me.<eos> It's just a two-minute video.<eos> It won't hurt you.<eos> Open the door!<eos> Julia!<eos> I need you to help me.<eos> Holt watched it.<eos> We've all watched it.<eos> Open the door!<eos> You're not real.

What happened? What happened?<eos> Tell me you didn't watch it.<eos> Tell me!<eos> She's dead. She's dead. She's dead.<eos> Hello?<eos> Gabriel sent me.<eos> I'm supposed to watch a video.<eos> Hello.<eos> Gabriel. Gabriel.<eos> Do you know about Skye?
I know.<eos> Someone put a picture of her online.<eos> Everyone's dropping out.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Do I still have a tail?<eos> Gabriel?<eos> Is someone still watching for me?<eos> I'm gonna find you someone, I promise you that.<eos> Just stay where you are.
Gabriel?<eos> Is someone still watching for me?<eos> I'm gonna find you someone, I promise you that.<eos> Just stay where you are.<eos> Who was that?<eos> It was Gabriel.<eos> Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> That's what he told Skye.<eos> Listen, Julia.<eos> I'm really sorry that you had to see that.

Listen, Julia.<eos> I'm really sorry that you had to see that.<eos> But I can't let you get caught up in this.<eos> I think it's a little too late for that.<eos> I watched it.<eos> Twelve hours after Skye.<eos> We were supposed to help each other through it.<eos> "Help each other"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - So were you and her...
I think it's a little too late for that.<eos> I watched it.<eos> Twelve hours after Skye.<eos> We were supposed to help each other through it.<eos> "Help each other"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - So were you and her...<eos> - No.<eos> Gabriel said a few of us were gonna be chosen for this experiment.<eos> If you just heard the way he described it.
It sounds crazy, but I'm just...<eos> The tape is the doorway to the other side.<eos> Then why did she die?<eos> You have seven days before you die.<eos> You just have to watch the tape and make a copy, and show it to someone else.<eos> And then you're fine.<eos> Gabriel calls it a "tail."<eos> Her tail just didn't show.<eos> So were you supposed to pass on a death sentence to someone else?<eos> How could you get involved in this?

Jules!<eos> What happened?<eos> A bird.<eos> There was a bird.<eos> Julia!<eos> See?<eos> I told you there was a bird.<eos> Julia!<eos> But I saw it.<eos> So, you watched the tape.
See?<eos> I told you there was a bird.<eos> Julia!<eos> But I saw it.<eos> So, you watched the tape.<eos> And I had dismissed self-sacrifice as popular myth.<eos> Holt was running out of time.<eos> It was the only way to save him.<eos> Anyone would have done it.<eos> You know, I could show you some research that would suggest the opposite.
It's different.<eos> I wasn't marked until day five.<eos> Gabriel, this has to mean something.<eos> It's happening faster.<eos> Maybe it is all changing.<eos> I wanted to believe that tape meant a lot of things.<eos> That our souls are eternal, and when we die, the spirit strives to find a new home.<eos> Then I saw the picture.<eos> I saw Skye's face.<eos> You saw it, too.

It shouldn't be there.<eos> I need my equipment.<eos> Okay.<eos> See, there's these weird gaps in the digital code.<eos> Glitches where we get these ghost images, like your bird.<eos> I mean, we're talking one or two frame still images, but there's more.<eos> There's video data condensed in the still frames.<eos> A video within the video?<eos> Well, there is now.<eos> I don't want you to watch it.

That is, if you can find it.<eos> Wait.<eos> I saw this.<eos> That's where they buried her.<eos> I traced it to a town called Sacrament Valley, about four hours from here.<eos> That's where we need to go.<eos> Hello?<eos> Thank you, Jamal.<eos> The police are on their way here.<eos> And you're not even coming with us!

Thank you.<eos> - He said the church was...<eos> - That's where they brought her.<eos> The cemetery.<eos> Look for her name.<eos> Come on, pick up.<eos> This is Holt.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> Holt, it's Gabriel.<eos> I don't know if you're getting these messages, but I figured out the mark on Julia's hand.
It's braille.<eos> I'm gonna come find you guys.<eos> "The waters rose to carry them and brought them back safely to God."<eos> Holt!<eos> Holt!<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> She's in there.<eos> Someone moved her.<eos> Jules?<eos> What are you doing?
Holt.<eos> Holt!<eos> Julia!<eos> Hey, what happened? What happened? What happened?<eos> I saw something.<eos> The well.<eos> - We were just looking...<eos> - I know who you're looking for.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - What did you find?
So, you want to know about Samara Morgan.<eos> Our priest was very active with the community back then.<eos> He heard that after all the little girl had been through that she was being denied a resting place.<eos> Well, who's to say that charity isn't meant for the dead?<eos> So why isn't she there now?<eos> Well, because we paid mightily for this act of charity.<eos> It was as if God and nature itself wanted us to be rid of her.<eos> - The flood.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But I had let myself believe, like you, that she was trying to tell me something.
It brought me peace.<eos> The priest requested that her body be moved.<eos> He left Sacrament Valley.<eos> She was buried in a potter's field just north of town, to be forgotten by all.<eos> I think we should get out of here.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> There is nothing about that girl that's worth being curious about.<eos> I need to see this through.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you think you were chosen for something?

I was right there.<eos> There you go, Karen.<eos> Chicken fried steak and coffee.<eos> Hey.<eos> Menu?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> So, what is that?<eos> Chicken or steak?<eos> You're funny.
So, what is that?<eos> Chicken or steak?<eos> You're funny.<eos> Look, I...<eos> I don't mean to be rude, but...<eos> The girl who's friends with your niece, the one who disappeared...<eos> Can you tell me a little bit more about what happened?<eos> My niece and she knew each other through the church music program.<eos> But she was the most gifted.<eos> People used to kid her, "You're too good for this place.

I guess there's certain jokes you shouldn't make because it happened.<eos> She disappeared.<eos> No clothes gone. No note.<eos> Just vanished.<eos> The priest.<eos> He kept you down here.<eos> The child!<eos> Thirty-four weeks.<eos> Eight and a half months.<eos> You were pregnant.

Jules!<eos> Julia...<eos> I know what it's like to be guided by visions.<eos> To be certain.<eos> I was certain that I would father a child that was gonna change the world.<eos> And I was right.<eos> You see, Julia, she didn't take my sight.<eos> I did.<eos> Good girl.<eos> - You're very brave.
You see, Julia, she didn't take my sight.<eos> I did.<eos> Good girl.<eos> - You're very brave.<eos> - You're Samara's father.<eos> You kidnapped Evelyn.<eos> The night that I laid with her, I heard them.<eos> The cicadas.<eos> You moved her bones and she's still your prisoner.<eos> As are you.

Samara.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's over.<eos> It's over.<eos> Not yet.<eos> What could that have felt like?<eos> To be feared by everyone who's supposed to love you.<eos> Not everyone.<eos> You were never afraid of her.

After all, their god was a war god.<eos> They left in a hurry, not bothering to sew their wounds or burn the dead.<eos> And when they reached their home shores, not one of them ever set foot in a boat or spoke of that new world ever again.<eos> Over 100 years later, when Leif the Fortunate, son of Erik the Red, would rediscover that land, he found his god waiting... along with his war.<eos> Best thing, only good thing about being in prison, is the relief.<eos> You don't worry if they're going to get you when they already got you.<eos> Tomorrow can't do anything today hasn't already managed.<eos> Even better with a death sentence. Bang.<eos> Worst has already happened.<eos> You get a few days to let it sink in, and then you're riding the cart on the way to do your dance on nothing.
No gallows humor. Yeah.<eos> Funniest fucking shit in the world.<eos> You know, I'm not superstitious.<eos> I believe in plenty when there's reason and evidence to believe.<eos> I don't believe in anything I can't see.<eos> I feel like there's a fucking axe hanging over my head.<eos> You know, I can't see it, but I believe it.<eos> I can see it fine.<eos> Prison has a way of trying to keep you in prison.<eos> They'll do anything they can to keep you inside with them.
Hello?<eos> I love you.<eos> Something feels weird. I love you, too.<eos> What feels weird?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Um... the weather.<eos> The air feels constipated, like if it'd just push out a storm, it'd be okay.<eos> It's nice here.<eos> The trees are budding.<eos> There'll be leaves on them when you get back.

Johnnie Larch got out after five years. He gets to the airport, hands his ticket to the woman at the counter, who asks for his driver's license.<eos> He gives it to her.<eos> She says, "It's expired." He says, "It might not be a valid drivers license", "but it is a damn fine identification.<eos> "There's my picture, my weight, and my height.<eos> Who the fuck do you think it is?"<eos> She says, "I'll thank you for not using" that sort of language with me, sir."<eos> He says, "Give me my fucking boarding pass right fucking now."<eos> Now, he has the right to take that tone.<eos> She was disrespecting him.<eos> You don't let people disrespect you in prison.

I slept through first class.<eos> Sorry we had to make an emergency landing.<eos> Can't blame us for the weather.<eos> I can get you on a flight tomorrow that'll get you into Eagle Point by 6.<eos> How many miles is it from here?<eos> I've only been on three other dates from the computer.<eos> I-I don't think I have the talent for it.<eos> But meeting you... I'm glad my kids forced me into getting on that stupid thing.<eos> You... like me?<eos> Are you sure?

What man does?<eos> Let me...<eos> Don't let go. Not yet.<eos> Do something for me.<eos> Worship me.<eos> Stay here... with your words... with your body.<eos> Worship me.<eos> Pray to me like I'm your god. Your goddess.<eos> Don't know how.<eos> You feel so good.

Not that rushing into things can't be a good thing.<eos> Sex rushed into tends to work out best for all involved.<eos> Marriages...<eos> I grant, they merit an extra moment's consideration.<eos> Apologies, amigo. Insensitive of me to talk about marriage.<eos> I am truly, deeply sorry about your wife.<eos> Nice obituary, though, I thought.<eos> Okay, I said fuck off politely as many ways as I'm gonna.<eos> Now I'm fixing to be direct.<eos> Don't you want to ask me about the job?

Okay, you're a little tall for a leprechaun.<eos> That's a stereotype and represents a very narrow view of the world.<eos> So what, you're from Ireland?<eos> I told you I'm a leprechaun.<eos> We don't come from Moscow, Russia.<eos> Or Moscow, Idaho, for that matter.<eos> How much has our man told you?<eos> No details.<eos> Devil's in the details.<eos> Do you know who he is?
But sweeter, smoother, stranger.<eos> It's mead... honey wine.<eos> Drink of heroes, drink of the gods.<eos> Tastes like a drunken diabetic's piss.<eos> It's a tradition.<eos> It seals our bargain.<eos> We don't have a bargain.<eos> Of course we do.<eos> I won the toss. You work for me now.<eos> You're my aide-de-camp.

You've told me what you want, but you want to know what I want?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Name your price.<eos> I just want to go to my wife's funeral.<eos> I just want to say goodbye.<eos> Now after that, yeah, fine, I'll work for you for $2,000 a week.<eos> You want me to hurt people?<eos> Well, I'll hurt people if they try and hurt you.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt anyone for fun or profit.<eos> I'll work for you up to which point you start to piss me off, and then I'm gone.

Whiff of death on the page.<eos> Laura Moon.<eos> Is...<eos> Is this your old lady's obituary?<eos> She was a fine piece of...<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> There's gonna be a lesson learned!<eos> Watch this.<eos> Atta boy.<eos> Now you're fighting for the joy of it, for the sheer unholy fucking delight of it!

And I know I recently said yes to something stupid.<eos> That may be true.<eos> Did he teach me that trick?<eos> You know, I believe he did.<eos> Don't suppose you heard him.<eos> No such luck.<eos> Where's my car?<eos> I dumped it.<eos> Red's not your color, and don't get used to this.<eos> You're going to be driving Betty here from now on.

Take all the time you need.<eos> Hello, Shadow.<eos> It's nice to see you.<eos> Did you escape, or did they, they let you out?<eos> Audrey.<eos> Well, not the reunion you were hoping for.<eos> Well, she looks pretty.<eos> They did a hell of a job reconstructing her face and neck.<eos> I think that and the coffin just killed your savings.<eos> All so you could have that nice open casket, get one last look at her pretty face.
Well, she looks pretty.<eos> They did a hell of a job reconstructing her face and neck.<eos> I think that and the coffin just killed your savings.<eos> All so you could have that nice open casket, get one last look at her pretty face.<eos> I'm sorry about Robbie, okay?<eos> He was a really good friend, and I know he loved you like crazy.<eos> So did Laura.<eos> Shit, Shadow.<eos> She died with my husband's cock in her mouth.<eos> What did you do, Laura?

Was it a one-time thing the night before I got back?<eos> That's... that's a "We're in this together" thing. W-Was it love?<eos> Because if you were going to leave, you could have just told me, okay? I could've taken it.
8 and 13... Fibonacci numbers.<eos> And I know that why?<eos> Because four of them were about math.<eos> I like math.<eos> Who knew?<eos> I just wanted to come back better than when I went in... for you.<eos> I wanted to be a part of your history.<eos> God damn it, Laura.<eos> Two funerals in a day... husband and best friend.<eos> You skipped Robbie's.

That's not an epithet. That is a literal description.<eos> Severed at the root in the crash.<eos> Coroner had the nerve to ask me what I wanted him to do with it.<eos> I told him leave it where he found it.<eos> Relax.<eos> They didn't bury Laura with it still in her mouth.<eos> I had them put it somewhere special.<eos> Don't listen to me, Shadow.<eos> I lost count on the Ativan. I'm interrupting.<eos> You were saying your piece.
Don't listen to me, Shadow.<eos> I lost count on the Ativan. I'm interrupting.<eos> You were saying your piece.<eos> No, I'm not. People did enough talking today.<eos> I think someone might've actually said she's in a better place.<eos> She's in Parkview Cemetery.<eos> Target would be more interesting than here.<eos> If there isn't some kind of life after death, I'm going to be so pissed.<eos> Kicked fucking puppy.<eos> I hated you guys as a couple because of this, the way that you looked at her.

Well, you just got out of prison.

You worked out in prison.
- No, no. Hear me out.<eos> This is a good one.<eos> Lex talionis.<eos> An eye for an eye, blow job for a blow job, right here where they can see us.<eos> I appreciate the offer, but...<eos> My husband and your wife... my best friend...<eos> I want them to see it.<eos> I want Robbie to watch while I take this gorgeous man's cock in my mouth.<eos> Pissing on him wasn't enough.<eos> I want you to come in my mouth,
My husband and your wife... my best friend...<eos> I want them to see it.<eos> I want Robbie to watch while I take this gorgeous man's cock in my mouth.<eos> Pissing on him wasn't enough.<eos> I want you to come in my mouth,<eos> I'm going to spit it on his grave.<eos> Jesus, who knew I could be so angry?<eos> No, no, no, no. Stop.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> You're right. Fuck me already. Don't, Audrey.
Audrey, don't.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I am trying to get my dignity back here!<eos> Look, hold on.<eos> Wait. Audrey!<eos> Hello, Shadow.<eos> Don't fuck with me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I won't.<eos> But if you could just drop me off - at the Motel America...
I won't.<eos> But if you could just drop me off - at the Motel America...<eos> - Hit him.<eos> See, I said don't fuck with me.<eos> Now that, that was fucking with me.<eos> Keep your answers short and to the point, or I will fucking kill you, or maybe I won't.<eos> Maybe I'll just have The Children here break every bone in your fucking body.<eos> So don't fuck with me.<eos> Got it.<eos> You're working for Wednesday.
Is that all?<eos> Wednesday is history.<eos> Forgotten and... old.<eos> He should just let it happen.<eos> We are the future, and we don't give a fuck about him or anyone else like him anymore.<eos> They are consigned to the dumpster.<eos> Now we have reprogrammed reality.<eos> Language is a virus.<eos> Religion, an operating system, and prayers are just so much fucking spam.<eos> Okay, w-well, y-you're saying all this like I'm supposed to know what the fuck you're talking about.
Okay, w-well, y-you're saying all this like I'm supposed to know what the fuck you're talking about.<eos> The dominant fucking paradigm, Shadow.<eos> That is the only important thing.<eos> By the way, I was sorry to hear about your wife.<eos> Tough break.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So I will ask again.<eos> What is it Wednesday is up to?<eos> We barely exchanged a dozen words.<eos> But you can let me out here and then I'll walk the rest of the way.

Do you know who he is?
Do you know who he is?<eos> Who he really is?<eos> Shadow Moon.<eos> You're my man now.
Do you know who he is?<eos> Who he really is?<eos> Shadow Moon.<eos> You're my man now.<eos> You've gotten yourself mixed up in some really weird shit, Shadow.

- Aw, Jesus, Nancy.<eos> - I'm gonna tell you a story.<eos> Haven't got time for a story.<eos> Just do the fucking work?<eos> Let me tell a goddamned story!<eos> I got a good one.<eos> Real good...<eos> Once upon a time...<eos> It sounds good already.<eos> You're hooked.
Because she had the gift of the gift.<eos> The blessing of blessings, hers to bestow.<eos> And her place of worship?<eos> That was the place to be.<eos> That was the goddamn shit.<eos> It was good fucking times.<eos> Kings didn't like that.<eos> Kings came one after the other to knock her off her throne.<eos> They didn't last long.<eos> When the queen was done with you... you were gone.
And our girl, after a while, even she forgot there's a queen inside.<eos> ISIS fighters destroyed the ancient temple, a once popular tourist attraction recently denounced by ISIS militants as quote, the necessary destruction of idolatrous structures in accordance with Islamic law.<eos> And there is no end to the cruelty of men threatened by strong women.<eos> So what's a queen to do?<eos> She gets on her knees.<eos> She takes what she don't want to, and we watch in easy fucking judgment and pretend we'd do a single thing different in her shoes.<eos> I hear they blew up your altar.<eos> Darn.<eos> I have a new one to offer you.<eos> Aren't you the lucky duck?
Life is long when you got regret.<eos> A moment can last forever when you can see how it should have gone.<eos> You get the moral to this story?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Don't compromise?<eos> Or... don't cut deals with treacherous motherfuckers.<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> Fuck no!<eos> Did you get this one off the discount rack?
Don't compromise?<eos> Or... don't cut deals with treacherous motherfuckers.<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> Fuck no!<eos> Did you get this one off the discount rack?<eos> Where are you getting in life without some fucking compromise?<eos> The moral is...<eos> - Get myself a queen.<eos> - You goddamn right.

Not in a long while has he been one of yours.<eos> You separate a head from a body, that is strike fucking one across the bow.<eos> They all ain't going to take that lightly. Good.<eos> Wait 'til he sees strike two, when I get myself that queen.<eos> What about you?<eos> Spill blood together, that binds you to him for life.<eos> Yeah, the fuck it does.<eos> Fuck it doesn't.<eos> Now, we have a compact.<eos> Yeah, up to which point you piss me off.

Because people believe in Easter.<eos> Believing is seeing.<eos> Gods are real if you believe in them.<eos> Gods.<eos> Fuck me.<eos> All right, so...<eos> That's Jesus Christ. A Jesus Christ.<eos> Some Jesus Christ.<eos> For every belief, every branch, every denomination they see a different face when they close their eyes to pray.<eos> So who are you?

A Jesus Christ.<eos> Some Jesus Christ.<eos> For every belief, every branch, every denomination they see a different face when they close their eyes to pray.<eos> So who are you?<eos> Like I said, you wouldn't believe in me if I told you.<eos> Happy Easter, you old fraud.<eos> And a fair Ostara to you.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?

Stop wasting time.<eos> I can't be bothered, so don't you go bothering me about it.<eos> Shadow?<eos> That's a sweet name.<eos> Now, now, now, now.<eos> Leave him be.<eos> Why do they call you Shadow, sweetness?<eos> The way I follow my mama around.<eos> She didn't know what else to call me.<eos> Well, I deal in sugar, Sugar, and you're the sweetest damn thing I've ever seen.

Aye, you heard?<eos> Well, I keep my ears pricked up.<eos> Come here, sweet Shadow.<eos> Allow me to impart some wisdom:<eos> There's far too many secret societies out there.<eos> They have no loyalty and no love.<eos> They range from barely competent to deeply dangerous.<eos> You don't sound like one of us.<eos> I'm not one of you.<eos> Yes you are.

For her to exchange as gifts at the first sign of spring in her name. Ostara. They still do.<eos> They still do.<eos> On my festival days, they still feast on eggs and rabbit and candy and they do it in my name.<eos> Serious question, my dear.<eos> I have no doubt that millions upon millions exchange tokens and observe the rituals of your festival, all down to the hunting of the hidden eggs, but does anybody pray in your name?<eos> Do they say it in worship?<eos> They mouth your name, but they have no idea what it means.<eos> None whatsoever.<eos> Same every spring.<eos> You do all the work, he gets all the prayers.
They mouth your name, but they have no idea what it means.<eos> None whatsoever.<eos> Same every spring.<eos> You do all the work, he gets all the prayers.<eos> What has gotten into you?<eos> I feel terrible about this.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> It's her day.<eos> You took it.

No!<eos> It's her day.<eos> You took it.<eos> You crucified her day.<eos> When they started following you, everybody else got burned.<eos> In your name.<eos> Happy fucking Easter.<eos> No...<eos> A word.<eos> You shut your mouth before I slap it off your goddamn face.
It's her day.<eos> You took it.<eos> You crucified her day.<eos> When they started following you, everybody else got burned.<eos> In your name.<eos> Happy fucking Easter.<eos> No...<eos> A word.<eos> You shut your mouth before I slap it off your goddamn face.<eos> How dare you.

They're sons of.<eos> They're men who walk the streets.<eos> They shake hands, they take shits.<eos> What I'm doing here is of no concern to them.<eos> This is your day, love.<eos> Always has been, always will be.<eos> Just don't try to tell me that they all worship you.<eos> I know they don't.<eos> I'm not a fool.<eos> No, you're not.
An old one.<eos> They killed Vulcan.<eos> They killed my friend.<eos> He pledged his allegiance to me, and forged a blade in my honor.<eos> And they killed him for it.<eos> The new gods.<eos> That's why we need you.<eos> That's why we need spring to fight them, to show them who we are.<eos> They will worship you.<eos> They will... worship you if you make them pray.
That's why we need you.<eos> That's why we need spring to fight them, to show them who we are.<eos> They will worship you.<eos> They will... worship you if you make them pray.<eos> They'll pray to Him.<eos> But he's not the goddess of spring.<eos> Shadow, my boy, I need a word with the fair lady here alone.<eos> Help yourself to a drink, two, tops.<eos> Still need you sharp.<eos> You've been avoiding me.
You've been avoiding me.<eos> My mistake.<eos> I used the phone.<eos> Worst thing you can do to someone is call them.<eos> I've been occupied.<eos> Yes, you have.<eos> Impressive reach metrics.<eos> Deep penetration.<eos> Total unique impressions is what sells and no one leaves an impression more unique than you.<eos> You've done well with me.
Deep penetration.<eos> Total unique impressions is what sells and no one leaves an impression more unique than you.<eos> You've done well with me.<eos> Very well.<eos> Now...<eos> It's my turn to do well by you.<eos> I can take care of you.<eos> Hands free, honeypot.<eos> I have no intention of spending the rest of my days feeding your soul from the vagina nebula.<eos> But... if you point that gun in the right direction...

Is this it?<eos> How'd you find it?<eos> Shadow's here.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Are they all...<eos> Jesuses?<eos> Right, of course, 'cause...<eos> Jesus is real.<eos> God damn it.<eos> Did you always believe?
I am belief, Shadow.<eos> I don't know how not to believe.<eos> I don't think I know how to.<eos> And I think maybe I...<eos> I don't really believe.<eos> You know, I don't really believe any of this.<eos> And maybe everything that's happened so far is just some kind of vivid dream.<eos> And...<eos> I don't even know if I can believe that.<eos> Even if you don't believe, you cannot travel in any other way than the road your senses show you.

Let them remind themselves it was a queen that gave them the harvest.<eos> They'll be hungry but then they'll turn to you, and they will pray to Ostara once again.<eos> She withholds, she returns.<eos> Prayer, reward.<eos> The ancient contract.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Hold that thought.<eos> Come on.<eos> A dead girl?<eos> I have a house full of guests and a garage full of caterers and you brought me a dead girl?
Selfish reasons.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Professional courtesy.<eos> Colleague to colleague?<eos> You all think I'm like you. I am not like you.<eos> You, I'm particularly not like.<eos> And that doesn't translate into courtesies owed, professional or otherwise.<eos> A favor, then.<eos> You do owe me that.<eos> Who were you, exactly?
Who were you, exactly?<eos> I was, Laura Moon.<eos> Um, I'm still Laura Moon.<eos> Laura Moon.<eos> Shadow Moon?<eos> We know he's here.<eos> We know who he's here with.<eos> Best he doesn't know I'm here.<eos> Best he don't know who I'm here with.<eos> How do you feel?
Laura Moon.<eos> Shadow Moon?<eos> We know he's here.<eos> We know who he's here with.<eos> Best he doesn't know I'm here.<eos> Best he don't know who I'm here with.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> I don't mean existentially, I mean physically.<eos> Sensationally.<eos> Are you in your body, but not of it?
And... cold.<eos> Cold in my bones.<eos> Livin' in her own apocalypse.<eos> Did, um... did Jesus go through his own apocalypse before you brought him back to life?<eos> I didn't bring Jesus back to life, no.<eos> He was dreamed back to life on my day.<eos> A very narrow sliver in that Venn diagram.<eos> This is your day.<eos> The vernal equinox, the light of the world.<eos> Rebirth, renewal, resurrection, can you do it?
I don't resurrect, I relife.<eos> Life has always been my gift.<eos> To regift.<eos> Well, good.<eos> Good, because... as it turns out, I actually have a lot to live for, and it's so close I can feel it.<eos> It's the only thing I can feel, so...<eos> I would really like to not be dead anymore so that I can feel it fully.<eos> So...<eos> How does this work?<eos> How it works is I find out exactly why you are dead and we go from there.
I'm starting to get an idea.<eos> Folks have always been curious about that exact moment of death.<eos> As if the difference between one side of that divide and the other could be quantified.<eos> Some believe that you can develop a last image seen off their retinas.<eos> Like a photograph.<eos> Death is usually the last enemy.<eos> Right but not for...<eos> not for Jesus Christ.<eos> Not for you.<eos> And you're no Jesus Christ.

I was.<eos> About that, we have a problem here.<eos> A...<eos> A problem with me? No.<eos> Not with you, you.<eos> You are perfectly lovely, but you dead, yes, is a problem for me.<eos> Well, no, but you said that you could regift the gift, I need the gift.<eos> I need to be alive.<eos> I can't help you with your dead.<eos> You are dead of a different kind.

Laura Moon, you were killed by a god.<eos> I can't interfere with that.<eos> That is a dead without undoing.<eos> Not by my hand, anyway.<eos> Shit.<eos> I have other guests.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I was killed... by a god?<eos> Which... fucking... god?<eos> Never saw you look quite so pretty before.

And to you.<eos> I could hardly wait to keep our date this lovely Easter morning.<eos> And your heart beat fast as you came through that door.
Happy Easter, Easter. And to you.<eos> I could hardly wait to keep our date this lovely Easter morning.<eos> And your heart beat fast as you came through that door.<eos> We had a date?<eos> Standing.<eos> Our Marshmallow Peep show.<eos> Candy cream eggs, cellophane grass, bunnies and duckies, we popularized the pagan.<eos> We practically invented brunch.<eos> We built this holiday.<eos> You and me.

Your sheep?<eos> Which fucking god?<eos> Me fucking god.<eos> I ran you off the road.<eos> See, here I thought I knocked the gear shift with my shoulder.<eos> All this time, I've been blaming myself.<eos> I guess now I have somebody else to blame, right?<eos> That's right, I killed you!<eos> I killed you fucking dead! No!<eos> You are not a god!

No!<eos> You are not a god!<eos> She said that I was killed by a god.<eos> You are a lot of things, but you are not a god.<eos> Which fucking god?<eos> I will squeeze them straight out of the sac.<eos> It'll be kind of like shucking peas.<eos> I swear to Jesus.<eos> He's right outside.<eos> You know which god.
He's right outside.<eos> You know which god.<eos> Of course I know which god.<eos> I want to hear you fucking say it, so say it.<eos> Wednesday.<eos> Fuck that guy.<eos> Why?<eos> Why me?<eos> Why murder me?<eos> You weren't murdered, you were sacrificed.
He doesn't!<eos> He's nothing.<eos> He's no one who just...<eos> Just happens to be the guy.<eos> When we robbed the casino, did Wednesday fuck up my perfect plan?<eos> It wasn't a perfect plan.<eos> Didn't account for divine intervention, did you?<eos> The whole fucking time, the robbery, Shadow going to jail, me dying, act of god?<eos> Just fucking with us to fuck with us?<eos> What do you think gods do?
The "he" I was referring to was Wednesday.<eos> He was here, trying to enlist me in some sort of something he was brewing.<eos> What are the ingredients of that brew?<eos> I dismissed him before hearing him out.<eos> I'm doing peachy.<eos> So why would I help him?<eos> That's right, a god has to be exotic.<eos> She has to be... a peach.<eos> And Wednesday, well, I suppose he's a lemon.<eos> You're an old god new again.

The platform and the delivery mechanism.<eos> We control the story.<eos> We control the flow.<eos> We are the flow.<eos> What you offer is existential crisis aversion.<eos> Don't look over there, look over here.<eos> Don't listen to that, listen to this.<eos> You provide a product, an innovative distraction and you keep innovating it and you keep providing it.<eos> The beauty of what we do is we only need to inspire.<eos> You don't have the juice.

"The thing I've been asking myself is"<eos> "what kind of sick individual names a street Edgewood Way" "and he put it half a mile away from Edgewood Lane?"<eos> It's crazy.<eos> You got me out here in this creepy, confusing ass suburb.
Fuck this.<eos> I'mma fucking go the other way I came.<eos> Not today.<eos> Not me.<eos> You know how they like to do motherfuckers out here, man. I'm gone.<eos> Come on, brother, this is...<eos> Sid, Sid, Sid.<eos> How's it goin' over there?<eos> Good.<eos> You got your toothbrush? Check.

They are not racist.<eos> All right.<eos> I would've told you.<eos> I wouldn't be bringing you home to them. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Think about that for, like, two seconds.<eos> I'm thinkin'.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Come on, I'm a grown man. No way.<eos> You broke my cigarette.

It's not too late for us.<eos> Okay, get your own girl.<eos> Goddamn. "She's all mad at you 'cause you never take my advice."<eos> Like what?<eos> "Like don't go to a white girl's parents' house."<eos> What's she doin'? Lickin' your balls or somethin'?<eos> - Yeah, bye. "<eos> Chris.<eos> This motherfucker hung up on me.<eos> You're jealous.
Fuck.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, that scared the shit outta me. You?<eos> Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Stay here.<eos> What?<eos> What are you doing?
And that mirror.<eos> Thank you, Officer.<eos> What?<eos> That was hot.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna let anyone fuck with my man.<eos> I see that.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're here.<eos> It's the groundskeeper.<eos> Are you ready?
I think my parents were in Greece or something.<eos> We raided their liquor cabinet and we're all shit-faced.<eos> Oh, my God. Tell me this isn't true, Rose.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I filled the liquor bottles with water...<eos> And let me finish?<eos> Uh-huh. Go ahead.<eos> I'm curious.<eos> So I'm upstairs hooking up with the hottest girl in class, Jean Deely. Oh, God.<eos> You realize you're coming off as, like, the world's biggest douchebag, right?
I'm sorry.<eos> A reflex that I have since gotten rid of. - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, you better be careful.<eos> Yeah, I'm very careful now.<eos> I'm gonna go get dessert.<eos> And, Dean, maybe clean it up just a little bit?<eos> So, Chris, what's your sport?<eos> Football? Baseball?<eos> Basketball, mostly, I guess.<eos> You an MMA fan?
Football? Baseball?<eos> Basketball, mostly, I guess.<eos> You an MMA fan?<eos> Dude.<eos> "Dude" what?<eos> What?<eos> Hey, Jeremy, why don't we let someone else have the floor for a second?<eos> You're dating my sister, right?<eos> He's dating my sister.<eos> You had your chance.
You're dating my sister, right?<eos> He's dating my sister.<eos> You had your chance.<eos> I can't get to know the guy?<eos> You mean like UFC?<eos> Yes.<eos> Nah, too brutal for me.<eos> You ever get into street fights as a kid?<eos> I did judo after school, first grade.<eos> Aw... You should've seen me.

You should've seen me.<eos> Judo?<eos> 'Cause with your frame and your genetic makeup, if you really pushed your body,<eos> and I mean really train, you know? No pussyfooting around. You'd be a fucking beast.
"My man, my man."<eos> I don't think he's ever heard that or said it.<eos> And now he just... It's all he says.<eos> Yup.<eos> Oh, and my mom being rude to Georgina?<eos> What the fuck was that about?<eos> That was so crazy.<eos> I mean... How are they different than that cop?<eos> That's the fucking bummer of it all.<eos> Anything more you'd like to add?
Wait.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come here. I'm sorry.<eos> This sucks. What?<eos> Why you saying "sorry"?<eos> 'Cause I brought you here and I'm related to all of them.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah?<eos> How are you so calm?
Why you saying "sorry"?<eos> 'Cause I brought you here and I'm related to all of them.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah?<eos> How are you so calm?<eos> Honestly, it's nothing.<eos> I like you on your racial flow, though.<eos> Is this a racial flow? Racial flow.<eos> Am I feeling a racial flow? Yeah, you're feeling racially flowy.
You think it was your fault.<eos> How do you feel now?<eos> I can't move.<eos> You can't move.<eos> Why can't I move?<eos> You're paralyzed.<eos> Just like that day when you did nothing. You did nothing.<eos> Now, sink into the floor.<eos> Wait, wait, wait. Sink.<eos> Now you're in the Sunken Place.
And I can barely remember anything, but now the thought of a cigarette makes me wanna throw up.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm sorry. I can't believe she did that to you.<eos> And I had some fucked-up dreams.<eos> What'd you dream?<eos> I was in a hole or something. And I couldn't move. It was like...<eos> Oh, God. That sounds terrible.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, uh, what's Walter's deal?<eos> What do you mean "his deal"?
Oh, God. That sounds terrible.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, uh, what's Walter's deal?<eos> What do you mean "his deal"?<eos> I just talked to him. Dude's whole vibe is hostile.<eos> Did he say something?<eos> It's not what he says. It's how he says it, you know?<eos> Maybe he likes you.<eos> Maybe he's jealous or something. I don't...<eos> Are you fucking with me?

It's how he says it, you know?<eos> Maybe he likes you.<eos> Maybe he's jealous or something. I don't...<eos> Are you fucking with me?<eos> No.<eos> So you think I've got a chance with him?<eos> All right, you got jokes.
No, funny. I'm gonna talk to my dad about that.<eos> That's not... No, don't talk to your dad. It's not cool.<eos> It's fine, it's not a big deal.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> Forget about it. It's done.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> It begins.<eos> Are you ready for this?
It begins.<eos> Are you ready for this?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> I'm not.<eos> There they are.<eos> So nice.<eos> How are you?<eos> Just smile.<eos> Smile?<eos> All right. How do you do that again?
Oh, that's great.<eos> Super. Gordon loves Tiger.<eos> Oh, the best I've ever seen.<eos> Ever.<eos> Hands down.<eos> So, Chris, uh, let's see your form.<eos> This is Nelson and Lisa.<eos> Hey, how you doin'?<eos> So, how handsome is he?<eos> I don't know, are you handsome?
I know.<eos> Life can be a sick joke.<eos> One day, you're developing prints in the darkroom. The next day, you wake up in the dark.<eos> Genetic disease.<eos> Shit ain't fair, man.<eos> Oh, you got that right.<eos> Shit ain't fair.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come here, come here.<eos> What the fuck? You left me out there.
Come here, come here.<eos> What the fuck? You left me out there.<eos> Look at this.<eos> She unplugged my phone.<eos> Who?<eos> Georgina. I came here to talk to Rod, and I got no juice.<eos> So you think she did that because...<eos> Really?<eos> It's a thing.<eos> So you are so sexy that people are just unplugging' your phone?
Forget it. Never mind.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Stop, don't...<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Don't...<eos> Okay, okay, I'm sorry. It's all good, all right?<eos> They got you on display now, huh?<eos> "It's weird, man. And it's the people here, too."<eos> It's like they haven't met a black person that doesn't work for 'em.<eos> Yep, you're in it.
"What?"<eos> I got hypnotized last night.<eos> Nigga, get the fuck outta here.<eos> No. Yo, yo. Yeah, to quit smoking.<eos> But it's Rose's mom's a psychiatrist, so...<eos> Bruh, I don't care if the bitch is lyanla Vanzant, okay? "Iyanla Vanzant: American inspirational speaker," "life coach and television personality." ________________________________________<eos> You ain't gettin' in my head. I know. She caught me off guard, right?<eos> But it's cool because I'm cured. It worked.<eos> Bruh, how are you not scared of this, man?<eos> Look, they could've made you do all types of stupid shit.
They was comin' over there like," "I'mma just suck a little dick, maybe jiggle some balls and shit." No.<eos> They didn't get a chance to jiggle shit because their head was off their fuckin' body.<eos> Yeah, they still sucked a dick, but without their heads. It was fuckin' weird, detached head shit.<eos> ________________________________________ "Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer, also known as the Milwaukee Cannibal," "was an American serial killer who committed the rape and murder" "of 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991."<eos> And thanks for that image right there, man.<eos> Hey, man, I ain't makin' this shit up.<eos> I saw on AE, man.<eos> "It's real life." Yo, and it's the black people out here, too.<eos> It's like all of them missed the movement. "'Cause they probably hypnotized."<eos> Look, bruh, all I'm doin' is connecting the dots. I'm taking what you presented to me, okay?
It's a tough one.<eos> Yeah, um, I don't know, man.<eos> Hey.<eos> Yo, my man.<eos> They were askin' me about the African-American experience. Maybe you could take this one.<eos> Well, well, I find that the African-American experience for me has been, for the most part, very good.<eos> Although I find it difficult to go into detail as I haven't had much of a desire to leave the house in a while.<eos> We've become such homebodies.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> But even when you go into the city, I've just had no interest.
I imagine that I owe you all an apology. No, no, no. We're just very happy that you're yourself again.<eos> Yes. Yes, I am.<eos> Hmm. And I thank God for you for calming me down.<eos> I know that I must've frightened you all quite a bit.<eos> Especially you, Chris.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The flash. I didn't know.<eos> Of course not.<eos> How could you have?<eos> And you shouldn't have been drinking, either.
Well, I'll have to let you all get on the rest of the night without the aid of my marvelous wit.<eos> The whole ordeal has made me quite a bit exhausted.<eos> Logan, you just get some rest.<eos> It was nice meeting you, Chris.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Something to lighten the mood?<eos> Yes! Yeah, let's get this party back on track.<eos> How about sparklers and Bingo?<eos> We're gonna go on a walk.<eos> You sure?
How about sparklers and Bingo?<eos> We're gonna go on a walk.<eos> You sure?<eos> Shall we?<eos> My cousin's epileptic.<eos> That wasn't a seizure, right?<eos> My dad's a neurosurgeon. And that's what he said it was. I'm inclined to trust...<eos> That wasn't a seizure.<eos> What was it then?<eos> How long have you known that guy?

I'm inclined to trust...<eos> That wasn't a seizure.<eos> What was it then?<eos> How long have you known that guy?<eos> I met him today.<eos> Man, this is gonna sound weird, but when he came at me,<eos> it felt like I knew him.<eos> Like you've met Logan before?
No, I don't know Logan.<eos> I think your mom got in my head, all right?<eos> I think she got in my head.<eos> Yeah, and it worked, I thought...<eos> No, it did not.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> She got in my head, and now I'm thinking all this fucked-up shit that I don't want to think about.<eos> Like what?<eos> I just need to go.<eos> - You wanna go? - Mmm-hmm.
I think she got in my head.<eos> Yeah, and it worked, I thought...<eos> No, it did not.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> She got in my head, and now I'm thinking all this fucked-up shit that I don't want to think about.<eos> Like what?<eos> I just need to go.<eos> - You wanna go? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Without me?<eos> Whatever you want.
I just need to go.<eos> - You wanna go? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Without me?<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> I told you about that night my mom died.<eos> When I didn't call 911, didn't go out looking for her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> One hour went by, then two, then three, and I just sat there.<eos> I was just watching TV.<eos> There's nothing you could've done.
Yeah.<eos> One hour went by, then two, then three, and I just sat there.<eos> I was just watching TV.<eos> There's nothing you could've done.<eos> I found out later that, uh, she had survived the initial hit.<eos> She laid there bleeding by the side of the road, cold and alone.<eos> That's how she died in the early morning, cold and alone.<eos> And I was watching TV.<eos> There was time. There was time.<eos> You were just a little kid.
No shit.<eos> Why's he dressed like that?<eos> It's not that, it's everything.<eos> He came to the party with a white woman 30 years older than him.<eos> Sex slave!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> "Chris, you gotta get the fuck up outta there, man!"<eos> "You in some "Eyes Wide Shut" situation.<eos> - Stanley Kubrick (1999)" "Erotic and mysterious drama film" ________________________________________<eos> Hello?

Are you packing?<eos> Rose, we gotta go. We gotta go now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. Is everything okay?<eos> I'll tell you in the car. But we gotta go right now.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Okay, yeah. Uh, let me go get my bag.<eos> Okay.<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, you ready?
Okay. Is everything okay?<eos> I'll tell you in the car. But we gotta go right now.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> Okay, yeah. Uh, let me go get my bag.<eos> Okay.<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, you ready?<eos> Yeah, I'm just looking for my camera.<eos> It's right here.<eos> Have you got the keys?
Rose! Rose, give me those keys!<eos> Rose, give me...<eos> Give me those keys.<eos> Rose, now! Now, the keys!<eos> Be careful, bro.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> Where are those keys, Rose?<eos> You know I can't give you the keys, right, babe?

Where are those keys, Rose?<eos> You know I can't give you the keys, right, babe?<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Is he hurt? Did you see him drop?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Jeremy, grab his legs, please.<eos> Take him downstairs.<eos> Dean, help him. I can get him alone.<eos> No, you can't. You've already damaged him enough.
Jeremy, grab his legs, please.<eos> Take him downstairs.<eos> Dean, help him. I can get him alone.<eos> No, you can't. You've already damaged him enough.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ready?<eos> Mind his head. Please.<eos> Easy.<eos> You're gonna drop him.
Okay, fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ready?<eos> Mind his head. Please.<eos> Easy.<eos> You're gonna drop him.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> You're not gonna give me a little credit?<eos> Okay, that was my fault.<eos> You were one of my favorites.

He left?<eos> Yeah. He got all paranoid, and then he freaked out on me.<eos> And then he just got in a cab and left his phone.<eos> Wait.<eos> You haven't seen him?<eos> No, he never came back here.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Look, look, I've been calling his phone a bunch of times.<eos> Matter of fact, I went to the police.<eos> What did you say?
Oh, good.<eos> Uh...<eos> Let me ask you somethin'.<eos> What cab company did he, uh, use to leave?<eos> Oh, gosh.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess maybe a local one.<eos> Or I guess he could've called an Uber?<eos> Um, wait. I'm so confused.<eos> Oh, you confused?

So last time I talked to Chris, he told me your mama hypnotized him.<eos> Rod, just stop.<eos> I know why you're calling.<eos> Why is that?<eos> It's kind of obvious, don't you think?<eos> "What?"<eos> That there's something between us.<eos> No. What you talkin' about, girl?<eos> I called you about Chris.<eos> No, Rod, whenever we'd go out, I remember you looking at me.
That there's something between us.<eos> No. What you talkin' about, girl?<eos> I called you about Chris.<eos> No, Rod, whenever we'd go out, I remember you looking at me.<eos> What the fuck you...<eos> No!<eos> Chris is my best friend. "Look, if you did somethin' to him..."<eos> I know you think about fucking me, Rod.<eos> "Ain't nobody thought about fucking you.<eos> Why would you say some stupid shit?"
"What the... You ass! Fuck you!<eos> Shit!<eos> God! She's so... She's a fuckin'...<eos> She's a... She's a genius.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> "Hey, Chris."<eos> "How's it going, buddy?"<eos> "You can answer. There's an intercom in the room."<eos> Where's Rose?<eos> "Oh, you dirty dog."

"Phase one was the hypnotism." "That's how they sedate you."<eos> "Phase two is this."<eos> "Mental preparation. It's basically psychological pre-op."<eos> Pre-op?<eos> "For phase three."<eos> "The transplantation."<eos> "Well, partial, actually."<eos> "The piece of your brain connected to your nervous system"<eos> "needs to stay put, keeping those intricate connections intact."<eos> "So you won't be gone, not completely."

One Mississippi. Two Mississippi. Three Mississippi.<eos> "911.<eos> What's your emergency?" I'm at the Armitage house.<eos> My name is Chris.<eos> "I'm sorry, sir, can you repeat that?"<eos> I'm at the Armitage...<eos> No, no, no. Don't do it, don't do it.<eos> Don't do it. Just fuckin' go.<eos> Grandma.<eos> You ruined my house!
And I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Help.<eos> Help. Help me.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Chris!<eos> I mean, I told you not to go in that house.<eos> I mean...<eos> How'd you find me?
Shadow, we're going to be releasing you later this afternoon.<eos> Your wife... she died in the early hours of this morning.<eos> An automobile accident...<eos> Also, you lost something vital in there, not just time.<eos> If I was inclined, what might I call you?<eos> I could be Mr. Wednesday with a shake of the handed.<eos> How much has our man told you?<eos> You're my man now.

Do you know who he is?<eos> Who he really is?<eos> She long dead.<eos> She wouldn't give it up for Johannes up there so he threw her off the boat.<eos> Did you know your momma couldn't swim?<eos> You all need to work on that.<eos> Take swimming lessons.<eos> This is how we get stereotypes.<eos> Anansi...<eos> You want help?
A hundred years after you get free, you still getting fucked out a job and shot at by police.<eos> You see what I'm saying?<eos> This guy gets it.<eos> I like him.<eos> He's getting angry.<eos> Angry is good.<eos> Angry gets shit done.<eos> You shed tears for Comp Anansi, and here he is, telling you you are staring down the barrel of 300 years of subjugation, racist bullshit and heart disease.<eos> He is telling you there isn't one goddamn reason you shouldn't go up there right now and slit the throats of every last one of these Dutch motherfuckers and set fire to this ship!<eos> You already dead, asshole.
No.<eos> No. No cops.<eos> The fuck you do?<eos> Why, it depends on who you ask.<eos> You ask the girl's mother, she'll say I did a series of unspeakable things.<eos> You ask that mouth-breather she calls a boyfriend, he'll be at a loss for words.<eos> But you ask the girl herself, I'm guessing she'll say I opened a few doors.<eos> Come on, ask her yourself.<eos> I'm asking you what do know about a slaughtered lynch mob?<eos> I don't know what the fuck you speak of.

They don't have a clue.<eos> They don't have a fucking clue.<eos> I don't have a fucking clue.<eos> Okay? I don't give a fuck if they don't have a fucking clue.<eos> I want one. Give me a fucking clue.<eos> Clues were not in the agreement.<eos> Neither was my ass hanging from a fucking tree. I was lynched.<eos> Strange fuckin' fruit.<eos> Plucked plucky fruit.<eos> Here you stand.
Here you stand.<eos> Unusual outcome for a lynching.<eos> Chalk it all up to occupational hazard.<eos> And occupational hazard gets hazard pay.<eos> Double your salary.<eos> That do it?<eos> - It'll do something.<eos> - Good.<eos> Compact amended.<eos> How much longer you gonna be in this town?

I don't know. Maybe another day.<eos> You're done here, we're done here.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Your first bed as a free man. Enjoy it.<eos> Shadow?<eos> About that little shit in the big limo.<eos> An assault on you is an insult to me.<eos> Don't think because I didn't lose my temper I'm not angry or I'm lacking a plan.<eos> I didn't mean to wake you.<eos> Laura... they told me you died.

Everyone.<eos> You were just having a bad dream.<eos> You going to miss it?<eos> Eagle Point?<eos> No.<eos> Never really had a life here.<eos> It's Laura's town.<eos> Too many people tell each other not to repress their emotions, to release their feelings, to let the pain go.<eos> There's a lot to be said for bottling up emotions.<eos> I'm gonna tell you something and you're gonna want to hurt me, but what I say has gotta be said.

- So what's the plan?<eos> Plan is we will be meeting with a number of people preeminent in their respective fields.<eos> And then we will rendezvous at one of the most important places in the entire country.<eos> Where is the most important place in the country?<eos> One of the most important places.<eos> Opinion is justifiably varied.<eos> But we will be stopping in Chicago first.<eos> What's in Chicago?<eos> My hammer.<eos> I've got a meeting in here, and I want you to do some shopping for me.

Look at it like this, Shadow:<eos> We're the coming thing.<eos> We are already here.<eos> We are self-driving cars and 3D printers and subdermal time-release insulin.<eos> And your old boss is still selling oranges on the side of the road.<eos> Not even organic.<eos> We are now and tomorrow... and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow.<eos> And he ain't even yesterday anymore.<eos> I heard about the trouble you had with the Technical Boy.<eos> I was impressed with how you dealt with him.
I was impressed with how you dealt with him.<eos> Efficient, no-nonsense, effective.<eos> Who'd have thought you had it in you?<eos> He was underestimating you, sweetheart.<eos> They all are.<eos> Not a mistake I'll make.<eos> Yeah, well I don't want to work for you, I-Love-Lucy.<eos> We're done.<eos> Whatever the old guys are giving you, I can give you so much more.<eos> You name it, honey.

Are you trying to wiggle your way out of this job?<eos> Lucy... - I-Love-Lucy talked to me.<eos> - The television program?<eos> No, Lucy herself came...<eos> This is so fucking crazy.<eos> - And like the rest of your life is sane?<eos> - Lucy talking to me from the TV is weirder by several orders of magnitude than anything that's ever happened to me.<eos> So far.<eos> At times the universe does seem to have singled you out for unique abuse.<eos> In these moments, you gotta ask yourself:
Yes.<eos> Okay, yes, ignore me.<eos> Always better dead than forgotten.<eos> And no one is ever gonna forget you.<eos> Now, flattering as that may be, this, on top of your other adventures...<eos> Sudden onset of strange.<eos> Fair cause for consternation, unless strange is a new language and what we're doing here is vocabulary building.<eos> Fuck your vocabulary.<eos> Okay? This is gibberish.<eos> You may have to consider that you didn't see what you saw.

So you'd open it very slowly.<eos> Every phrase chosen carefully 'cause they charge you by the word.<eos> First wire ever sent by Samuel F.B. Morse himself in 1844, "What hath God wrought?"<eos> Goddamn information age is what.<eos> Best thing about these states we're headed towards...<eos> Minnesota, Wisconsin... Is that they have the kind of women that I loved when I was younger.<eos> Pale-skinned, blue-eyed. Hair so fair it's almost white.<eos> Wine-colored lips, full round breasts with veins running through them like a good cheese.<eos> Only when you were younger?<eos> You did alright last night. You wanna know the secret of my success?

You wanna know the secret of my success?<eos> The secret is charm.<eos> Yeah, well, you either got it or you don't.<eos> Charms can be learned like anything else.<eos> Zorya Vechernyaya.<eos> He don't going to be happy to see you.<eos> Organic bullshit.<eos> Of course you come after I do shopping.

- I can help.<eos> You sit.<eos> You are guest.<eos> Coffee first.<eos> The Zorya sisters always make a marvelous home.<eos> We do okay. We pay rent on time even.<eos> We make some money from the slaughterhouse.<eos> My sister and I make a dollar here, a dollar there reading fortune.<eos> I make the most of course.<eos> It's because you tell the prettiest lies.
You know?<eos> So... Saying that before it happens is just playing the odds.<eos> You go sit, be comfortable.<eos> Washroom is second door, not third.<eos> The third you do not touch. My other sister is sleeping inside.<eos> She needs her rest.<eos> Is she sick?<eos> He does not know our world.<eos> I'm easing him in.<eos> You are worst man I have ever seen.
I'm easing him in.<eos> You are worst man I have ever seen.<eos> - That smell.<eos> - We have guest.<eos> We have two guests.<eos> Votan!<eos> Nice to see you, Czernobog, old friend.<eos> I brought a gift.<eos> Yeah?<eos> And some of that herb Havarti you like so much.
Votan!<eos> Nice to see you, Czernobog, old friend.<eos> I brought a gift.<eos> Yeah?<eos> And some of that herb Havarti you like so much.<eos> Why is he in my home?<eos> Make him not be here, or I'll make him not be here.<eos> I already invite him for dinner.<eos> I cannot uninvite. I come here only to share bread and information.<eos> What you choose to do with the latter is entirely up to you.
Thought you were supposed to read tea leaves.<eos> Tea is disgusting.<eos> So what does it say?<eos> You will have a long life, and a happy one, with many children.<eos> That bad?<eos> Any good news?<eos> Your mother die of cancer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You no die of cancer.<eos> Can you get out?

You no die of cancer.<eos> Can you get out?<eos> I want you to get out!<eos> And take your man with you.<eos> Or I will break him open... Shh! Shh!<eos> I'm not going with you anywhere!<eos> - Shh! - What's the matter?<eos> Let her wake up.<eos> Let your sister hear this con man, this son of a bitch, come into my home and try to make me die.<eos> You brought that madness into my life once.

You know what these hands have done.<eos> You want my brother, and he's not here.<eos> Then we'll die.<eos> It will be glorious, win or lose.<eos> I'm tired of glorious.<eos> - Is something wrong?<eos> - Nothing at all, my sister. Go back to sleep.<eos> I'm not successful.<eos> We should go.<eos> Said you needed him.
- Nothing at all, my sister. Go back to sleep.<eos> I'm not successful.<eos> We should go.<eos> Said you needed him.<eos> There's always another way.<eos> No, no, no. No. Food is cooked.<eos> Zorya Vechernyaya invited you for dinner, right?<eos> So you stay and you eat.<eos> Otherwise, she will be insulted.<eos> You understand? But if you want to leave after, I will hold open the door.

My old friend?<eos> You're black, right?
You understand? But if you want to leave after, I will hold open the door.<eos> Delicious.<eos> To think I nearly missed this fabulous meal?<eos> Thank you, ladies.<eos> Shadow. My old friend?<eos> You're black, right?<eos> That a problem?<eos> We never much care about skin, like the Americans.<eos> Where we're from, everyone has the same color, so we must fight over shades.<eos> You see, my brother had light hair and beard. Me dark, like you.
As against my brother, the white.<eos> Everybody thought he must be the good one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But time passes.<eos> Now I'm gray.<eos> Yeah, he too, I...<eos> I believe, now is gray.<eos> So you wouldn't be able to tell who is light, who is dark.<eos> So much for fighting over color.<eos> Yeah, you see, when we came to America, we first came to New York.
Aye? And then we came here, Chicago, everything became bad.<eos> I think in the old country, you know, I am forgotten.<eos> Here, I'm like a bad memory.<eos> So, I had to find work, and I found meat business. You know it?<eos> I know the eating part.<eos> I know the killing.<eos> So I got job on killing floor as a knocker.<eos> It was a good job.<eos> Yeah, skilled labor.<eos> A cow comes up the ramp. Boom, boom, boom. And you take a sledge hammer, and...

Boom, boom, boom. And you take a sledge hammer, and...<eos> You knock the cow dead.<eos> It takes strength. No cow-killing stories during dinner.<eos> How do you think meat get on your plate?
To give a good death is art.<eos> But nowadays, they have this bolt gun.<eos> You know? Put it on the forehead.<eos> Yeah. Now every monkey with a thumb can kill.<eos> They sit there all day, all night.<eos> Yeah, so much for killing.<eos> Hey, do you know checkers?<eos> I was in prison for three years.<eos> Yeah, people go crazy for chess.<eos> But you know what?
Exactly.<eos> After you finish eating, maybe you and I play checkers.<eos> I shall play black.<eos> Is good?<eos> - Is good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I like it.<eos> Confident.<eos> Maybe we even bet a little?<eos> You don't have to play him.

The sisters don't play.<eos> But I keep sharp, not like my arms.<eos> They don't get the workout they used to?<eos> No more killing floor to swing my hammer.<eos> First blood is mine.<eos> So you've lost.<eos> Game is done.<eos> I just started.<eos> Confident.<eos> You wanna see it?
The hammer.<eos> The one I used to kill.<eos> It's dull now, but...<eos> The secret to keeping it clean is use.<eos> Yeah, blood feeds it, gives it shine.<eos> You know, the best blood flows at sunrise, when the cattle is rested, fed, and calm.<eos> Now my hammer is red with rust.<eos> No more sunrise blood.<eos> Ten thousand deaths made right here.<eos> Are you going to play or what?
Are you going to play or what?<eos> It's your move.<eos> Your move.<eos> Hey, we make a wager on our little game?<eos> You relax.<eos> This is not your game, okay?<eos> You see, your master wants me to come with him to deal with his nonsense.<eos> Well...<eos> Listen. If I lose, I will go with Votan and do what he asks, and I will nod in front of the others.<eos> And if you win?

Is good?<eos> He'll take that shot... no joke, no boast, no half-measures.<eos> How good are you?

How bad do you need him?<eos> It's your decision.<eos> All right, if-if all this is real, and... and... and TVs talk, and she can read fortunes and hammers bleed, and if there is a world... under a world...<eos> Yo, fuck it.<eos> Is good.<eos> Is good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your move.<eos> So at sunrise, I get to knock your brains out.<eos> And you will go down on your knees... willingly.
Yo, fuck it.<eos> Is good.<eos> Is good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your move.<eos> So at sunrise, I get to knock your brains out.<eos> And you will go down on your knees... willingly.<eos> Is good?<eos> A shame.<eos> You're my only black friend.
But he's an old-time Central Asian specialist, one of the best we have.<eos> About your vintage.<eos> It'd take me only a conversation or two to find your men down there.<eos> That's great.<eos> - But it can't be done from here.<eos> You'd have to send me there.<eos> - Send you?<eos> - Not what I meant, your team.<eos> I meant mine.<eos> You're really certain?
- We meet at the nearest fountain.<eos> Bugs don't work there.<eos> And we of all people are to save the Kachek reunification?<eos> Yes, which is why I need a technician-operative I can rely on.<eos> Radio-based info-exchange, eavesdropping, light explosives, the works.<eos> And we had to wait 25 years for them to come crawling and suss that we were the better secret service.<eos> And now the idiots want...<eos> Is that Group Council Chairwoman coming?<eos> Well, we always had a Party Member with us back then.<eos> Who else do you need?
Müller?<eos> - Müller!<eos> Müller the Saxonian!<eos> An MP for the Christian Socialist Union campaigning against solidarity tax... in a perfect Bavarian accent.<eos> Then it's Locke.<eos> - Not Locke!<eos> He only thinks of money.<eos> He earned a buck on the fall of the Wall.<eos> Locke is the best.<eos> Say... Do you need to inform anyone?
He only thinks of money.<eos> He earned a buck on the fall of the Wall.<eos> Locke is the best.<eos> Say... Do you need to inform anyone?<eos> Well, the dacha will suffer a bit...<eos> Boys, am I glad to see you.<eos> Hey, girly...<eos> Over here. Take a seat.<eos> When someone comes in, offer them a drink and say:<eos> "Mr von Falkenberg will be right with you." You can manage that, huh?
It's not about earning money in this case.<eos> We can make actual demands.<eos> To put BFC Dynamo back in the 1st division?<eos> Very funny.<eos> I mean serious things.<eos> Basic income for all. Nationalisation of banks.<eos> The right to work.<eos> - Collectivisation of farming.<eos> That's it, asshole!<eos> You're a colossal asshole.
All the world's secret services romped around here.<eos> You don't really believe anything remains from back then?<eos> This hideout could survive even a nuclear attack.<eos> My God. This was a top-notch tech room.<eos> Satellite broadcasting, the lot.<eos> Where's the stuff?<eos> - I've no idea.<eos> Maybe some kids...<eos> - Kids! The door had a perfect access mechanism.<eos> Did you clear it all out and flog it?
You treasonous asshole!<eos> - The Reconnaissance Directorate is done. The country we worked for is done, too.<eos> The country is done because of the likes of you.<eos> Thank God the fucking country's done.<eos> Stop with this shit.<eos> He was spying on us.<eos> You knew his grandfather?<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> I'm going to come on tough.<eos> When I go for a smoke, you show understanding and he'll spill the beans.

Talk!<eos> Why?<eos> Who do you work for?<eos> Have it your way.<eos> You don't scare me, old man.<eos> You remind me of my grandpa.<eos> Sit down and tell me a fairytale.<eos> Ah, I get it.<eos> You like the girl.<eos> Can you still get it up?
Now we have the coordinates, and know where Harry's new bar is.<eos> Hosty and Modrany have not yet made contact.<eos> Harry's the only one who did things right.<eos> He stayed on.<eos> He was a specialist on female sources.<eos> A Romeo agent?<eos> - Yes. He was the best.<eos> The Dean Martin of the East.<eos> I see.<eos> - You're pretty so watch it.
- Maybe General Karpov is meeting Dumov.<eos> Yes.<eos> - But Dumov won't bring the hostages.<eos> So we'll be on his heels.<eos> - Marking procedure.<eos> Shoe transmitter.<eos> I still have a good one.<eos> First we inspect the hotel. Right.<eos> Locke?<eos> You're buying the joint.
With this I lodge a tiny tracker under his skin.<eos> It's like a mosquito bite.<eos> Here.<eos> It'll lead us to the hostages.<eos> Well, then... cheers.<eos> But you are taking me along, right boys?<eos> You'll need me in any case.<eos> As a joker card.<eos> You know, chambermaids, switchboard operators...<eos> I see... You think I've lost my touch.

Good day.<eos> The suite is reserved for General Karpov.<eos> You'll all have to leave at once.<eos> Please.<eos> If you please.<eos> Not up there again!<eos> Paula?<eos> CONFERENCE CENTRE IN THE FORMER BUNDESTAG, BONN<eos> Things are coming to a head here.<eos> Kasan has to sign the accord in two days and you haven't called.
A lead.<eos> Anschütz is teetering.<eos> He's under fire, it's a matter of time.<eos> Will Kasan be here in two days or not?<eos> Give me 24 hours, okay?<eos> - Fine.<eos> Good luck.<eos> But that looks terrific.<eos> Tomorrow will be challenging.<eos> - You're ready.
- Fine.<eos> Good luck.<eos> But that looks terrific.<eos> Tomorrow will be challenging.<eos> - You're ready.<eos> I think so.<eos> Good night.<eos> What's between you and this agent?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> You nearly wept when you thought he was dead.
- It has no bearing.<eos> Why was I not told?<eos> It alters the whole mission!<eos> No, our relationship's shit. We're strangers.<eos> I didn't choose my father.<eos> He is an egoistic asshole.<eos> I was supposed to be on the Kasan-job.<eos> Again he blocked my way.<eos> What about you?<eos> Don't you have any family? Children?
No, no... Everything is fine.<eos> I'd like one, too.<eos> - I'm sorry...<eos> I have to go down.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> When you smile your eyes light up like... a moonlit Lake Baikal.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm in the process of rescuing your country!<eos> What was that?<eos> How did you know Kasan is in the country?
Are you really a Kachek?<eos> Your face looks very European.<eos> You have such pretty, pale skin.<eos> We go back six generations...<eos> Do you have Kachek blood in your veins?<eos> Excuse me. An old friend is here to see you.<eos> Dimitri!<eos> Falk!<eos> Unbelievable!<eos> So it was you all along.

Falk!<eos> Unbelievable!<eos> So it was you all along.<eos> What brings you back here?<eos> - Can we speak in private? No.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I want...<eos> I want Frank Kern.<eos> I don't have Kern.<eos> - I know that you do.
So it was you all along.<eos> What brings you back here?<eos> - Can we speak in private? No.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I want...<eos> I want Frank Kern.<eos> I don't have Kern.<eos> - I know that you do.<eos> I see...<eos> You still haven't got over it. That he unmasked you.
I want Frank Kern.<eos> I don't have Kern.<eos> - I know that you do.<eos> I see...<eos> You still haven't got over it. That he unmasked you.<eos> Well, all right. Let's assume... I do have Kern.<eos> Why would it be in my interests to entrust him to you?<eos> Send them out.<eos> Her, too.<eos> What do you have to offer me?

Nice one.<eos> - My father unmasked you?<eos> I'll explain later.<eos> You still there?<eos> Put him in that.<eos> - How do we find the hostages now?<eos> We take him with us.<eos> It's our only chance.<eos> Jaecki!<eos> Seduce Dumov? Are you insane?
Put him in that.<eos> - How do we find the hostages now?<eos> We take him with us.<eos> It's our only chance.<eos> Jaecki!<eos> Seduce Dumov? Are you insane?<eos> I had everything under control.<eos> - And how far would you have gone?<eos> As far as necessary.<eos> You've no idea what the guy is capable of.
Glienicke Bridge.<eos> - Meaning what? We swap Dumov for Kasan and your dad.<eos> No way.<eos> You do nothing more. The BND is taking over.<eos> For years the BND didn't have a single picture of me.<eos> Till your fucking father unmasked me.<eos> - Stop the car.<eos> No, I'm personally freeing your father.<eos> Stop right now!<eos> You're staying here.

Don't shoot!<eos> Lower your guns!<eos> What are you all doing here?<eos> - We're freeing you, asshole.<eos> Many thanks.<eos> Are you coming along?<eos> The legendary Falk Team.<eos> Incredible they dug you up, of all people.<eos> Careful.<eos> Congratulations. You did it.

Dumov told Karpov we have a leak. We do?<eos> There are no leaks at the BND.<eos> Lonski wants a ton of money for the flight.<eos> Up front.<eos> - "See you later."<eos> You have to help me.<eos> Paula is in danger.<eos> - She said she needs nothing... from an old loser.<eos> - Wait!<eos> You'll manage.

- She said she needs nothing... from an old loser.<eos> - Wait!<eos> You'll manage.<eos> I have to tell you something about Paula.<eos> She was born nine months after I unmasked you.<eos> Nice try.<eos> - It's true.<eos> I don't know to this day whose daughter she is.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - First you have Martha betray me, then you steal my child?
It just happened.<eos> Sorry, can you take a rain check?<eos> It's time to move if we're to end the mission.<eos> And how are we to pay Lonski?<eos> We'll take care of it.<eos> Locke...<eos> Er, well...<eos> The watch, Locke, the watch.<eos> It was my father's.<eos> Why didn't you tell her?
Excuse me?<eos> - Seen her eyes?<eos> Check out her hands.<eos> And she's pretty, smart and strong willed.<eos> Plus she's successful.<eos> It seems to really matter to you.<eos> Grown sentimental in your old age, huh?<eos> Sentimental by coming along to save your ass?<eos> I only wanted cash for the flight.<eos> - As a threat to Schell, they won't admit you to the old Bonn Bundestag.
To the bedroom and... Loki Schmidt?<eos> Hannelore Kohl?<eos> It didn't help in the end, anyway.<eos> This historic site, where German reunification was ratified, is where your accord will be signed in an hour.<eos> You can rest till then.<eos> Hansen, please bring Mr Kasan to the secure zone.<eos> Hansen, wait.<eos> I'm coming along.<eos> I'm staying with Kasan.<eos> - If you wish.
The Moscow Armament Fair.<eos> No, like your lot at the 82 Bayreuth Peace Accord.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You knew about that?<eos> I just have to go to the toilet first.<eos> - Now? You're kidding.<eos> - My prostate.<eos> Hey, Müller.<eos> - My Lord!<eos> What are you doing here?
- In safety.<eos> Alright. On we go, then.<eos> So it's Bayreuth 82.<eos> No, Bonn 2016.<eos> Thanks.<eos> One moment.<eos> Your ID, please?<eos> - I have to save my daughter.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - You betrayed my father and Kasan.

Shit.<eos> We need a paramedic in room 115.<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> What does he mean?<eos> He had to play the hero again.<eos> - Papa!<eos> He thinks he's your father.<eos> What?<eos> He was with your mother when I unmasked him.<eos> You were born nine months later.
It just grazed me.<eos> It might be better if you all stepped back.<eos> I'm staying, Jaecki.<eos> - Thank you for your faith in me, Locke.<eos> So... here we go, then.<eos> What's in the case?<eos> - What?<eos> Is there a bomb in it?<eos> - A bomb? No, just the accords.<eos> How did you plan to kill Kasan?

You work with Dumov. - No. You confessed.<eos> - Rubbish.<eos> You must have revealed my route.<eos> The route.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> Anschütz was doomed if the Kasan-job failed.<eos> And balls to Kachekistan!<eos> - It was a career move?<eos> The Service has to change if we're to protect people in the future.<eos> You said it, too: The oldies have to go.
Oh, God!<eos> - Why would you do that?<eos> - Somebody call 911.<eos> Help!<eos> Some....<eos> Call help, please.<eos> Right now.<eos> Get someone here.<eos> My God!<eos> Why would you do that?
Well, I don't want to die before we get there, Toby.<eos> - What's going on over here?<eos> - Eddie.<eos> - Wait, Eddie Iodice? Eddie died?<eos> - Mm-hmm. Yeah, just to get there.<eos> Just to fucking get there.<eos> Guy pulled a Marilyn Monroe, downed a whole bottle of pills right there in his bedroom.<eos> Good dude, too.<eos> - Real pity.<eos> - You didn't wanna go to the service?

Dad said he needed to change things up.<eos> People knowing our address was too dangerous.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't tell you on the phone, but we don't trust phones now.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Off to see the wizard.<eos> What the fuck is this place?<eos> Uh, it used to be a summer camp for "troubled youths."<eos> Which I never really understood, because if they're bad kids, why would they deserve a fun summer?<eos> But then it shut down and Dad bought it.<eos> What do you think?
Some of them arrived here after two or three failed suicide attempts.<eos> We gave them a home, something to live for in this life, a reason to contribute.<eos> Oh, uh, real quick.<eos> Just FYI, FBI-type thing, protocol is no cell phones.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> Let's go.<eos> This is truly thrilling.<eos> I can only compare it to the model train set you let me assemble by myself on my birthday.<eos> Cutting it a little close.<eos> Oh, well, you know me.
They're just running some tests.<eos> - It's all routine.<eos> - Ten seconds.<eos> Paddles charged... and ready.<eos> See, they're recharging the body to reboot the brain.<eos> The longest he's ever officially under is, like, 60 seconds.<eos> So, Dad is now killing himself and electroshocking back to life.<eos> No.<eos> Kind of.<eos> But you're...

- Can you not see that?<eos> This is a cult.<eos> All the way down to these followers in different-colored jumpsuits.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> There's no hierarchy here, Will.<eos> Dad calls it... distinctions in clearance.<eos> - That's all.<eos> It's not a cult.<eos> - It should be different. Straitjackets.<eos> You're the one that wanted to come back here for whatever reason. Right?
No, no, no.<eos> There's no hierarchy here, Will.<eos> Dad calls it... distinctions in clearance.<eos> - That's all.<eos> It's not a cult.<eos> - It should be different.

"Therefore, it is my belief consciousness should be considered as another state of matter."<eos> - Please don't.<eos> - Hang on.<eos> I'd like to get to this other part. It gets good.<eos> "Properties of consciousness arise from the physical laws that govern our universe."<eos> - I was wrong.<eos> - You don't believe that.<eos> We were wrong, Dad.<eos> We were wrong because a lot of people died.<eos> And a whole lot more people are gonna kill themselves... while you experiment here in this ridiculous fortress.

They know it's there.<eos> Now we have to show them what's behind it.<eos> Isla!<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What's your problem?<eos> Come on.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Get up.<eos> - Why are you doing this?
Isla!<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What's your problem?<eos> Come on.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Get up.<eos> - Why are you doing this?<eos> - None of your fucking business.<eos> You sat there on that fucking ferry and had a conversation with me, knowing you were gonna do this.

- None of your fucking business.<eos> You sat there on that fucking ferry and had a conversation with me, knowing you were gonna do this.<eos> You were supposed to be the last person I ever spoke to.<eos> You don't get to just change that!<eos> You're not even emotional about dying.<eos> I'm not emotional about anything.<eos> I'm just concerned... that this will all be perceived unfavorably by some.<eos> She was going to catch pneumonia, Toby.<eos> I still don't know what you want me to do with her.<eos> You told me that you take in people who need help.
You told me that you take in people who need help.<eos> She needs help.<eos> She still can't just stay here.<eos> We have rules.<eos> Then can we make an exception... in her case, please?<eos> We're talking about somebody's life.<eos> We have no idea if she will attempt or try to...<eos> Kill myself again?<eos> You can say it.<eos> I know what happened. I was there when you ruined it.
We have no idea if she will attempt or try to...<eos> Kill myself again?<eos> You can say it.<eos> I know what happened. I was there when you ruined it.<eos> She and I have been getting along great.<eos> We still have rules.<eos> She has to talk to Dad, and she has to take the questionnaire.<eos> What's the questionnaire?<eos> - Um... - Can we be...?<eos> Will, you have a visitor.
And what aspect of regaining normalcy after losing someone... was the most difficult?<eos> Inanimate objects, maybe?<eos> Like... my coffee table. I've had it for years and I've probably looked at it a million times, but after he... Familiar objects just became distorted and unfamiliar.<eos> I started to hate my ceiling fan, my cereal bowl, my tea kettle.<eos> Okay, last question.<eos> Are you legitimately suicidal?<eos> If you knew what came after... this life... do you think it would affect your decision-making or maybe even make you change your mind?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Knowing could change things.<eos> How'd you know this is where you'd be staying?

Yeah, good.<eos> She needs to be looked after.<eos> She could try again.<eos> I don't think that's going to happen, Will.<eos> Because tonight... everything changes.<eos> We finally unveil it.<eos> What is "it," Toby?<eos> Dad wanted me to invite you to a little gathering tonight, just a select group.<eos> Boy, this is nothing like our old house, huh?<eos> It sounds to me a lot like you're advocating murder.
We finally unveil it.<eos> What is "it," Toby?<eos> Dad wanted me to invite you to a little gathering tonight, just a select group.<eos> Boy, this is nothing like our old house, huh?<eos> It sounds to me a lot like you're advocating murder.<eos> I'm not advocating murder.<eos> I'm just pointing out that most people don't look at ending somebody else's life the way they do their own.<eos> Where is he?<eos> It's about to happen.<eos> I can't tell when you're talking to me or that. It's really annoying.
Anyways, what I'm saying is, people are killing themselves to get there.<eos> At a certain point, they'll use the same logic to kill somebody else, 'cause they're just sending them somewhere else, right?<eos> Finally, he's here.<eos> And he is not wearing the temp jumpsuit I had left for him.<eos> We're programmed to process our experiences as having a beginning and an end, when, in reality... doesn't exist.<eos> It's just one long, drawn-out middle.<eos> Some of you are newer than others, but I wanted to create a select group that could see what it is that I built.<eos> But before we do that, I'd like to take a moment and have you join me in... bowing our heads...<eos> And let your subconscious... take you somewhere else.<eos> I'm sort of amazed that you get swept up in this, this easily.

- Can we talk about it for a second? - I'm not allowed to talk about it, 'cause I just signed a nondisclosure agreement.<eos> So, your dad's a little weird. Who cares?<eos> It doesn't make him wrong.<eos> I mean, Poe fucked his cousin. It didn't make him any less a writer.<eos> I wanna see if that machine does what he thinks it does.<eos> Well, what if it did?<eos> How would that change things?<eos> You don't go on vacation without looking at the brochure first.<eos> Hey. Uh... I'm sorry.<eos> Were you sleeping?

Uh... I'm sorry.<eos> Were you sleeping?<eos> I'm standing.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> That's just something you're supposed to say, I guess.<eos> Since you're up, mind coming downstairs and taking a look at something for me?
Well, yeah.<eos> That's just something you're supposed to say, I guess.<eos> Since you're up, mind coming downstairs and taking a look at something for me?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> - Where are you guys going?<eos> - It's nothing. Don't worry about it.<eos> When he flatlines, think of it as a light bulb turned off by a switch.<eos> Flip it on, flip it off.<eos> But going under, hooked up to the new device, you're not just flipping a light switch. You're essentially detaching the entire bulb.<eos> So, I'd say that if you go under again... you're coming back with next to no brain functionality.

I'm doing the job of five people.<eos> Off-season cutbacks and whatnot?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can I give you a description... of Billy?<eos> That way if he does... come in, you can keep an eye out for him.<eos> Of course.<eos> Let's go to my office.<eos> I'd like to point out you're reading off a laundry list of corpse requirements.<eos> Aneurysm, that won't work.<eos> It'd be nice if you could help me, seeing as we're breaking and entering.
What?<eos> "Fifty-two, massive coronary."<eos> Will... meet Pat Phillips.<eos> Pat Phillips, this is Will.<eos> I don't like that creepy room Cooper put me in.<eos> I'm gonna sleep in your room tonight.<eos> Top or bottom?<eos> We could talk, you know.<eos> When I'm nervous, I talk too much or not at all.<eos> Well, you're safe here.
We could talk, you know.<eos> When I'm nervous, I talk too much or not at all.<eos> Well, you're safe here.<eos> I mean... nothing leaves the bunk beds.<eos> When I first got here and they gave me that jumpsuit, it had a V etched on it. I wonder what that stood for.<eos> "Visitor," maybe?<eos> Is that a guess?<eos> That was a pretty good guess.<eos> It's like one of those really obvious answers that only seems obvious after you find out about it.<eos> Were you really smart growing up? I bet you were.
Maybe... tell me about your mom now.<eos> There's not much to tell.<eos> She killed herself.<eos> On their anniversary.<eos> How did she do it?<eos> She made them dinner, and... my dad didn't even come out of his office.<eos> If he'd even just hinted that he gave a shit, I mean, who knows?<eos> So, she went upstairs... took a bath instead and, uh...<eos> Yeah, the next morning I found her in the tub.<eos> And so, you left?

I knew.<eos> It's like everything that was recognizable sort of instantly became unrecognizable.<eos> Sometimes I feel like I'm taking someone else's spot and then I feel sad.<eos> How do you mean?
Hit it again.<eos> - You're gonna fry the body.<eos> - Toby, hit it again.<eos> Again.<eos> Hit it again.<eos> Again.<eos> Hit it again.<eos> Is this just a setback or...?<eos> I'm really not sure.<eos> Are you gonna see him?
- You're gonna fry the body.<eos> - Toby, hit it again.<eos> Again.<eos> Hit it again.<eos> Again.<eos> Hit it again.<eos> Is this just a setback or...?<eos> I'm really not sure.<eos> Are you gonna see him?<eos> Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it?
Is this just a setback or...?<eos> I'm really not sure.<eos> Are you gonna see him?<eos> Or are you just gonna continue to ignore it?<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> I can't.<eos> Of course you can't.<eos> Story of your fucking life.<eos> Just run away and leave me to deal with the mess.<eos> What are you doing with my body?
What are you doing with my body?<eos> Your body, uh, is to be cremated at noon, so, I'm getting it ready.<eos> We do still have a little time to prep a redo.<eos> Redo? Guys, come on. You almost fried the body.<eos> You do this redo, you're gonna cremate him early. All right?<eos> Toby, rustle up a van.<eos> Will's right.<eos> It's good.<eos> Seeing you back in the labs again, it's good.<eos> It's where you belong.

Can I ask you something?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - How'd you end up here?
Why?<eos> I came home and found my dad and my sister hanging in my living room.<eos> To get there.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> They didn't want me to come.<eos> Can you imagine feeling abandoned 'cause your dad left you out of the family suicide?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Nothing, I'm just... I'm processing.<eos> I mean, do you ever get out of your head even for one minute?

I'm processing.<eos> I mean, do you ever get out of your head even for one minute?<eos> Let's do an experiment.<eos> Look at me and tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.<eos> I'm driving.<eos> I don't know you very well.<eos> I think you're beautiful, and alive, and if you killed yourself, it wouldn't just be sad, it would be a tragedy.

Bad reception on the island. Um...<eos> Yeah, the body seems to be abandoned, and...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Unless, of course, you guys are playing some sort of fucked-up scavenger hunt.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> - How'd that go?<eos> - It went really well.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're, like, weirdly good at that.
- Oh. - Here they are.<eos> They're pretty confused.<eos> What do you think they're thinking?<eos> I don't know, but I think Pat Phillips has had a really tough few days.<eos> We're both going to hell.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whatever the afterlife is, I guess.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just stupid.<eos> Are you gonna see him?

Are you looking for something?<eos> Maybe you can help me. Um...<eos> - Did there used to be a hallway here?<eos> - Used to.<eos> They did a little remodeling.<eos> Took their sweet-ass time with it, too.<eos> I'm sorry, how long ago was that remodel?<eos> About a decade ago.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Where have you been?
Thank you, my boy.<eos> Well, hello to you all.<eos> As always, it's a pleasure.<eos> When you all first got here, you... You used this, uh, piece of equipment.<eos> The questionnaire.<eos> And your answers are what allowed you to stay here, so, basically... a trust was built.<eos> But lately, I'm beginning to wonder if perhaps we're getting just a little too comfortable here.<eos> There's a lot of loose talk going on.<eos> And it makes me think that we just might be losing a little focus.<eos> Lacey, would you join me, please?

Pack up your belongings. Say your goodbyes.<eos> That was a hell of a show out there.<eos> Come on, Will.<eos> You think I don't know a lot of this is bullshit?<eos> You give meaning to people who think they have no more reason to live.<eos> The jumpsuit, the chain of command, the theatrics.<eos> It gives them purpose.<eos> And I care about them.<eos> Yeah. Someone should tell that to Lacey.<eos> You...

It gives them purpose.<eos> And I care about them.<eos> Yeah. Someone should tell that to Lacey.<eos> You...<eos> You can pretend all you want that the reason you left was because you stopped approving of my work.<eos> Work, by the way, that we did together.<eos> But I think we both know this was never about the Discovery for you.<eos> - It was always about your mother.<eos> - Yes, of course it was about Mom for me.<eos> Just because you wanna pretend like Mom did not happen... doesn't mean that I'm going to.
- You were gonna keep this from me?<eos> - No, I'm... I'm showing you now.<eos> And I was afraid of what you might do.<eos> All right, so, the afterlife...<eos> This is the afterlife?<eos> How can it be the afterlife if we're in the same parking lot in that recording?<eos> Then what is it?<eos> My theory is that my father invented something that records memory.<eos> You've heard him go on and on about the subconscious.<eos> I understand that you wanted this to be something different.
"Why is he doing it?"<eos> Let's see.<eos> Well... he'll tell you about the millions of people who died, and he'll tell you about finishing his work to honor them.<eos> I heard that yesterday.<eos> I've been hearing that for the past two years now.<eos> And I just... smile and nod and agree... like the idiot son, but I do understand things.<eos> I know Mom died...<eos> Not died. She killed herself.<eos> She killed herself.<eos> And when you look... at what Dad spent his life working on, and when you look at the way Mom killed herself, how she did it... how would Dad not feel a little anger on top of his guilt?
He overreacted, that's all.<eos> He'll come to his senses, and, uh, Lacey will be back by tomorrow.<eos> Dad always comes to his senses.<eos> It's not a memory, Will.<eos> What?<eos> On his left arm in that exact spot, there was a different tattoo.<eos> - How is that possible?<eos> - I don't know, but in the lab, I saw it.<eos> It wasn't a lighthouse. It was waves on his arm.<eos> - Are you sure?
We need to find something in this video that still exists.<eos> The...<eos> The woman.<eos> There's a...<eos> Her.<eos> We have Connor Phillips' address on his death certificate.<eos> So, I say that we go down there tomorrow... and we see if somebody can help us track her down.<eos> Will, why are we back here?<eos> I don't know what's waiting for us at that house, and I...<eos> Do you remember I told you about my accident when I was a kid?
The...<eos> The woman.<eos> There's a...<eos> Her.<eos> We have Connor Phillips' address on his death certificate.<eos> So, I say that we go down there tomorrow... and we see if somebody can help us track her down.<eos> Will, why are we back here?<eos> I don't know what's waiting for us at that house, and I...<eos> Do you remember I told you about my accident when I was a kid?<eos> Yeah, when you lied to your mom about what you saw.
If he told you that, it's a lie.<eos> He called and said he was gonna visit him, but he never showed up.<eos> This is gonna sound really strange, but did Pat have a tattoo?<eos> He told you about that?<eos> Well...<eos> When he turned 18, we got matching waves.<eos> We were really close then.<eos> So, the machine doesn't record a memory. It wasn't a bad theory.<eos> People are just gonna keep killing themselves.<eos> You know, sooner or later, you're gonna have to forgive your dad.
And I don't know why we think it'll be different somewhere else... unless we learn what we're supposed to while we're here.<eos> What was your son's name?<eos> I was dreaming.<eos> When he was in the water, I was dreaming.<eos> What about?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't remember.<eos> It was one of those times where you know for sure you're dreaming, but you don't... don't know what about.<eos> I wish I knew.<eos> You don't have to do this alone anymore if you don't want to.
Slow down and tell me exactly what happened.<eos> He hooked himself up to the device. He wanted to prove that it works.<eos> - Dad's hooked up right now?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We need to tell him that it works.<eos> What?<eos> What works?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - He demanded.<eos> - Why aren't you bringing him back?
We already know that it records something.<eos> Cooper... it works, okay?<eos> Dad? Time to pull yourself away.<eos> Come back to reality.<eos> Come home.<eos> - Is that Mom?<eos> - It's Mom.<eos> What I'm doing is reality.<eos> I need to finish.<eos> It's important. Do you understand?
Alternate realities?<eos> No, our reality... with differences and variations.<eos> Stepping out of a truck... to visit a dying parent.<eos> Random, like different tattoos.<eos> Stopping someone from going upstairs to end their life.<eos> When we die, what if we travel to an alternate version of our own life?<eos> A second chance?<eos> Then we wouldn't... just have to accept our biggest regret.<eos> In the afterlife, we could change it.<eos> At the risk of stating the super fucking obvious... if you are right and word of this got out...
In the afterlife, we could change it.<eos> At the risk of stating the super fucking obvious... if you are right and word of this got out...<eos> We have to destroy the machine.<eos> Everyone wants to know what's going on.<eos> Welcome, everybody.<eos> Nice to have you all here.<eos> I asked you to gather here today because I thought that we should be honest.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Honest with ourselves, honest with each other.<eos> - You got to see your mom again.
I asked you to gather here today because I thought that we should be honest.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Honest with ourselves, honest with each other.<eos> - You got to see your mom again.<eos> - I see you as family... and I think you see me in the same way.<eos> And as family... I think sometimes we get so absorbed with... what we're doing individually, we go off on our own track and so forth, we lose the fact that how important family is.<eos> Lacey, it's okay.<eos> Put the... Put the gun down.<eos> Lacey, I was wrong.<eos> You do not need to do this.
I need your help!<eos> I just wanted my spot back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Isla.<eos> Dad, please help her.<eos> Don't talk.<eos> Just breathe.<eos> I don't wanna die anymore.<eos> You're okay.
- It's off-season. - Why are you going to this dreary island?<eos> - I have to stop your shooting, Isla.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> I need you to come with me right now.<eos> Sit down, Will.<eos> This is just your memory.<eos> I'm a part of you. Sit down.<eos> What are we doing back on this ferry?<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> You were never able to stop me from killing myself until this life.

I changed my mind.<eos> I don't know what I was thinking.<eos> The first time, you never got off the ferry.

Your death brings you back here.<eos> You keep coming back over and over again and again.<eos> I don't remember any of it. I don't remember these other lives.<eos> Nobody can remember them directly.<eos> But sometimes certain memories do have a way of sticking out.<eos> You look so familiar to me. You look so familiar to me.<eos> It's your lucky day. I don't normally carry these around.<eos> - This is where I saw whatever...<eos> - This is the beach.<eos> How'd you know this is where you were gonna be staying?

Isla, please. I'm not ready to leave you.<eos> - What's happening to me?<eos> - You're about to die.<eos> His heart's stopped, Thomas.<eos> Organs are shutting down.<eos> They're trying to bring you back.<eos> That's okay.<eos> If I die, I'll just come back here to you.<eos> No, not this time.<eos> You don't have to come back anymore.

- Hey, come here.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Come here, come here.<eos> I got you.<eos> You okay?<eos> - Holy cow. - Give me that pail.<eos> - You went down pretty good, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yep.<eos> You okay?
- You went down pretty good, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yep.<eos> You okay?<eos> I got you.<eos> Where's your mom and dad?<eos> It's okay. He's all right.<eos> He just...<eos> - I told you, you can't...<eos> You can't just run off on me like that, okay?
- Yeah.<eos> Yep.<eos> You okay?<eos> I got you.<eos> Where's your mom and dad?<eos> It's okay. He's all right.<eos> He just...<eos> - I told you, you can't...<eos> You can't just run off on me like that, okay?<eos> I've told you.
He was just... He's all right.<eos> He was struggling a little bit in the water.<eos> I wanted to make sure he got back to you.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He's a good kid.<eos> - You're okay.<eos> You can't do that. You scared me.
I wanted to make sure he got back to you.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He's a good kid.<eos> - You're okay.<eos> You can't do that. You scared me.<eos> Okay?<eos> Can you walk a little bit?
- You told him what?<eos> - I think he could help.<eos> Just listen for a second. I'm sorry.<eos> I... I don't really understand.<eos> What?<eos> You need some money?<eos> I'm here, Marius, because I heard that you were taking down a cheater.<eos> And I don't like cheaters.<eos> And he's good, Marius.<eos> - You've seen him play? - No.
3 of diamonds.<eos> Oh.<eos> You're good.<eos> You got that it's a number card in red, but you're not great.<eos> It's the 6 of hearts.<eos> Sorry you came all this way, Vince, for nothing.<eos> Try the cherry pie. - Marius, wait.<eos> Wait. - Eddie...<eos> Eddie...<eos> Just give him a second. Won't you just listen?
Eddie...<eos> Just give him a second. Won't you just listen?<eos> - Let me go talk to him.<eos> - Go.<eos> Marius.<eos> Come on, Marius.<eos> Jim Brown was number 32 in Cleveland and 44 at Syracuse.<eos> Syracuse and Cleveland it was.<eos> You know he was also a great lacrosse player?<eos> Maybe you pushed Vince too hard back there?
False alarm, buddy.<eos> _<eos> Hey.<eos> Psst.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Motherfucker!<eos> God damn it.<eos> You okay? Yeah.<eos> Just a leg cramp.<eos> You like what you see?
Yeah.<eos> Vince makes a call, they open up.<eos> His games go all night. Sometimes I need a break from all those assholes leering at me, like you're doing right now.<eos> Where's Eddie?<eos> Running the big table.<eos> Oh, he doesn't know he's a prisoner? No.<eos> Really?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Vince has a big player. He's ahead, and Eddie's his favorite dealer.<eos> Why do you want to know where Eddie is?

Now you know.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I need to relax.<eos> I also wanted to see you.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you ever stop to think about what happened to Charlie could have happened to me?<eos> Every second, everyday.<eos> Did you talk to Marjorie?<eos> Three fucking years I survived.<eos> I'm not going to risk that.<eos> You have ten seconds before I start yelling again.

Uh...<eos> Ah. Don't worry about it.<eos> That's all right. Next time.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> There's always a place at my tables for you, Mr. Mukherjee.<eos> Hmm? Yeah.<eos> He's not coming.<eos> God damn it.<eos> I almost had him when I told him Affleck was playing, but... he's such a starfucker.<eos> So you're rested and rejuvenated?
He's not coming.<eos> God damn it.<eos> I almost had him when I told him Affleck was playing, but... he's such a starfucker.<eos> So you're rested and rejuvenated?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Well...<eos> All right.<eos> I love hockey.<eos> I love Amanda. I love supporting her dreams.<eos> Yeah. And you love coffee.
Go get 'em. [engine starts]<eos> It's just me.<eos> I said it's just me.<eos> Why do I have the gun?<eos> So Amanda's playing hockey now, huh?<eos> You got to get up at the crack to get that...<eos> She mentioned you the other day. Said "Whatever happened to that guy" "who was around before Brendon?"<eos> Couldn't remember your name.<eos> Maybe because she hasn't seen you in five years.<eos> Well, you... you told me to leave.

So five years gone.<eos> Wow.<eos> In the joint?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I heard about Charlie.<eos> Not the particulars.<eos> [sigh] Anyway, I'm sorry.<eos> I don't have any money, Marius.<eos> I'm not asking for money.<eos> Then what are you asking for?
Not the particulars.<eos> [sigh] Anyway, I'm sorry.<eos> I don't have any money, Marius.<eos> I'm not asking for money.<eos> Then what are you asking for?<eos> Uh, uh, I need you to backstop me with my parole officer.<eos> I was supposed to check in a couple of days ago, and by tomorrow he's going to be on fire.<eos> No. I don't want to have anything to do with your narrative.<eos> No.<eos> You know, I don't want to have to tell Brendon - you're running a con. - I'm not running a con.
No.<eos> You know, I don't want to have to tell Brendon - you're running a con. - I'm not running a con.<eos> Sure you are.<eos> Look at you, you know.<eos> You're pretending to be some suburban housewife, - cooking casseroles... - Thank you.<eos> ... and pot roasts and shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, according to that definition, everyone would be running a con.<eos> Fine. Fuck.<eos> I'm running a con. But you know what?

Keep it simple.<eos> You know anyone driving a black Grand Am?<eos> Force of habit. I always clock the cars on the block.<eos> I haven't seen that car before.<eos> The place I'm staying, there's some suspicion. What? I...<eos> I don't want your shit coming here.<eos> You know, it's really not a big deal.<eos> Hey, I'm going to need a favor. - Oh, for fuck's sake.<eos> - That thing you did in Wichita.<eos> Do you remember that?

Look.<eos> I know he snuck out last night.<eos> He hit a squeaky floorboard and went out the window. I never heard him come back.<eos> Hey.<eos> The house is still very quiet.<eos> We'll see what the doctor has to say about that.<eos> I'm not dead yet, for Christ's sakes.<eos> This is going to be a really sad last run if Dr. Geffen says that's off the table.<eos> It's not all about you, Otto.<eos> How do you think I'd feel if you kick it when you're on top of me some night?

I didn't want to wake you, so I... I went out the window.<eos> And I...<eos> I borrowed your truck. I went to the city with it.<eos> I drove to White Plains to... to visit a friend.<eos> Uh, and I am so sorry.<eos> I'll pay you back for the gas.<eos> All you have to do is ask, Pete.<eos> There's no need to sneak around.<eos> I know.<eos> I know. We have an old beater you can use to get around whenever you need.

I, uh...<eos> I just... I know that there was a, uh, an access to an attic in one of the rooms, and Taylor and I used to go up there.<eos> We would, uh, set up our mad scientist lab and, you know, mix together potions and all that.<eos> Do you remember that?

You made an unholy mess up there.<eos> Well, we were mad scientists.<eos> Uh, the attic access was in your aunt Lila's room.<eos> This was Maggie's.<eos> You changed it.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Julia: You look tired.

It's going.<eos> Did you know in the state of Connecticut, for a pickle to be considered a pickle, it must bounce?<eos> You studying to become a food inspector?
How's that going? It's going.<eos> Did you know in the state of Connecticut, for a pickle to be considered a pickle, it must bounce?<eos> You studying to become a food inspector?<eos> Taylor's going to take his detective exam... again.<eos> Well, at least he's trying to accomplish something.<eos> She was just joking, Audrey.<eos> I was?<eos> So when are we going to head to Pine Top? - Hmm?<eos> - Uh, yeah.<eos> Whenever you... Whenever you want to do that.

- Uh, yeah.<eos> Whenever you... Whenever you want to do that.<eos> You remember when we... we blew up that old truck? Right?<eos> With all that... that stolen dynamite? Hmm?<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> My sainted brother broke the law?<eos> No, I...<eos> It was... We blew up a paint can with a firecracker.<eos> Oh, Grandpa, I was hoping to leave Jacob with you while I went to the shop today.<eos> I knew you'd forget.

The woman in White Plains is Katie Boyd.<eos> Husband is Brendon Boyd.<eos> Pretty sure your Pete is bumping uglies with Mrs. Katie Boyd.<eos> You want me to stay on him?<eos> Uh, maybe I just picked up on the cheating. - Set off my alarms.<eos> - Yeah, you do have a pretty good instinct in that regard.<eos> How much longer do I have to keep doing shit for you?<eos> I mean, I'm not asking for the exact date, - more general.<eos> - Oh, I don't know, Sam.<eos> I'd say you have to keep doing what I ask you until you pay what you owe.

Whoo-hoo.<eos> Another $200.<eos> We're saved.<eos> I got a question I've wanted answered for 20 years.<eos> What's in the safe?<eos> No, I just... I just have a memory of all of us wondering what was in there.<eos> Oh, just say it.<eos> What?<eos> "Rublies."<eos> What? You don't remember rublies?
Oh, just say it.<eos> What?<eos> "Rublies."<eos> What? You don't remember rublies?<eos> When we were kids, I said there might be gold and diamonds and rublies.<eos> - Oh, right.<eos> - I thought there was an L in it.<eos> That was hilarious.<eos> Yeah, for you.<eos> Called me rublies for a week. I was just happy you were calling me anything. So...
Thought I'd take Pete with me out on rounds.<eos> Jacob's down for his nap.<eos> Snacks and juice are in the bag. And, uh, thanks.<eos> Our pleasure, sweetheart.<eos> How was the, uh, the doctor, Grandpa?<eos> Oh, he said I was fine.<eos> He said you shouldn't exert yourself.<eos> He said I shouldn't exert myself any more than any man my age. And how old are you?<eos> 25 when I look in the mirror.<eos> ♪ Let go ♪ You didn't tell Grandma about Persikof, did you?
You didn't tell Taylor about the New York warrant, and I'm pretty sure Persikof didn't say anything.<eos> What are you thinking? You're thinking something.<eos> Does Persikof get another bail hearing?<eos> This morning, but it'll be short. Bail will be revoked because he skipped.<eos> Okay, so this is... this is where it gets a little complicated because I...<eos> I quit my insurance job so abruptly, my former boss is being slow on my last paycheck, and, because I was living hand to mouth...<eos> You want money? We're broke.<eos> No, no, no. I'm just saying. If new... new bail is granted, then, you know, maybe...<eos> I get half. New bail? This guy's beyond a flight risk.<eos> But this time is collateral, you get, you know, uh, his mother's house.

This guy's beyond a flight risk.<eos> But this time is collateral, you get, you know, uh, his mother's house.<eos> I could give you 10%, tops.<eos> But it better be a brilliant plan.<eos> - It's a real...<eos> - Let's hear it. Okay. So we go to Persikof's lawyer...<eos> Mm-mm.<eos> What, you know him?
I didn't skip. I got the dates wrong.<eos> What did the police report say?<eos> Whatever that awful bail woman said is a lie.<eos> Uh, well, you know, the police report didn't say much.<eos> Why? - Nothing about New York? - Ma.<eos> [beeping]<eos> Is there something I should know about?<eos> No.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm guessing you're mad at me.
[beeping]<eos> Is there something I should know about?<eos> No.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm guessing you're mad at me.<eos> Why would I be mad at you, Lance?<eos> I was just trying to help you out.<eos> A client with bogus collateral. Okay, now, I didn't know that.<eos> Wanted for murder in New York.<eos> - What? - You gonna pretend you didn't know about that?

You honestly think I would send you a murderer?<eos> Nothing you could do would surprise me.<eos> Is that why we're here?<eos> That's not why we're here, right?<eos> - Who's he?<eos> - Hi. I'm Pete.<eos> Pete Murphy.<eos> Who is Pete Murphy?<eos> My long-lost cousin.<eos> Yeah, okay. If you have anything more to accuse me of, can you make it quick?
I can't remember if we were running your client to ground because he was trying to skip or if it was all just an innocent mistake.<eos> I can't remember if your client took my cousin's gun and his mother suggest that he shoot her or if it was all very amicable, ending in me unfortunately but innocently suffering a blow to my face.<eos> So if you could just ask your client which version is correct.<eos> Honestly, I just want my memory back because, in the end, is there anything more important than memories?<eos> Yes, there are more important things, like not getting disbarred.<eos> Oh, Lance, you know, if you don't feel like you can sell it...<eos> Oh, Cousin Pete, you really think goading me is going to work?<eos> I'm not...<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> You owe me.
I'm too much?<eos> But do tell me, what is this Bullwinkle?<eos> Bullwinkle was a moose.<eos> Hey, pal, you got the time?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Hello, Eddie.<eos> My name is Detective Frank Winslow.<eos> I know the con you and your brother are running.<eos> I also know you don't tell the truth.
