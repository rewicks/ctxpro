If you can make this happen pretending to be a lawyer... imagine what you could do if you became a real one.<eos> We need to make sure you do.<eos> Right, Felix?<eos> Felix!<eos> Sometimes it's... Not so bad having you around.<eos> Just so you know, what I heard was, "I love you."<eos> Well, if he's choking, you're doing that wrong.<eos> No, Ama, that was a hug.<eos> "Another thing we didn't have in our village."<eos> We didn't.
- Of course, they've got a horn.<eos> No way...<eos> Order must be restored! Felix!<eos> So you haven't lost the plot.<eos> This magic stuff is real.<eos> Who'd have thought, right?<eos> You could've told me I was a semi-pro netballer with a crush on Andy!<eos> - Don't know why I didn't.<eos> - Come on, Felix, we all know why.<eos> - We do...?
Nothing, she was perfect.<eos> She was top of her class in law school, and she's an academic fellow for the united nations.<eos> Wow, so she's good enough for the entire world, but not Yolanda.<eos> But Derrick, Cheryl sounds like the one.<eos> I mean, you don't just meet somebody like that.<eos> I mean... I had that with my last boyfriend, Cooper.<eos> We had this amazing connection until, you know...<eos> He dumped me and moved to China.<eos> But, you know, the point is if you love somebody...<eos> I do!
My issue isn't the Secret Service guy.<eos> M-My issue is that I, uh... I knew our victim.<eos> You knew him? - Yeah.<eos> - How?<eos> Well, I met him about four months ago, he said his name was Marty.<eos> I didn't sleep with him.<eos> Um, we were engaged in... a game of chance.<eos> You're gambling.<eos> I thought you stopped.<eos> I did.
Yes.<eos> Will Olden, 32, lawyer, lives in Park Slope.<eos> Made about $150 K last year.<eos> His only client is the estate of a dead guy.<eos> Here's what I got on the estate.<eos> Okay, so,<eos> Olden loses almost an entire year's salary at the poker table last night.<eos> Why extend a marker to a guy who can't pay it back?<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> It does to someone.
Hey, mush, you got a problem?<eos> No.<eos> You want one?<eos> What?<eos> Hold on a sec.<eos> I think I'm gonna kick your ass.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Is that a good idea?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Oh, you don't?
That explains why you're always scratching yourself in the vacation photos.<eos> Anyway, consider yourself the lucky one.<eos> You were just a baby.<eos> You were still home, suckling on mom's breast. Oh!<eos> Please don't go there.<eos> I don't know if it was just the lighting, but last night, I swear, I saw mom in Kim's face.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, did she tell you she loved me?<eos> It didn't come up.<eos> In fact... nothing did.
You're just kind of an idiot.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That is a fucking very valid point.<eos> So stop doing idiot things.<eos> Alvey's not wrong, Lisa.<eos> Nobody wants to put me on a fucking card.<eos> I've pissed off a ton of promoters.<eos> Do you want to fight?<eos> Fuck. Yes.<eos> I do.
- I've got a headache.<eos> - OK. Well, you should go home.<eos> OK!<eos> Time to go!<eos> - I know you still want one, don't you?<eos> Time to go. Bye, now.<eos> Time to go!<eos> - Goodness!<eos> - Olivia, Susan Peterson. - Hello.<eos> - Oh, how do you do?
Mr. Chambers is just enquiring after Mr. Staunton's will.<eos> On behalf of his wife.<eos> He didn't have a will.<eos> That's odd, isn't it?<eos> We lawyers are a bit like doctors.<eos> Neglect our own lives because we think we're immortal.<eos> Sherry?<eos> Whiskey, perhaps?<eos> I had you down as a sherry man.<eos> Most people do.
We lawyers are a bit like doctors.<eos> Neglect our own lives because we think we're immortal.<eos> Sherry?<eos> Whiskey, perhaps?<eos> I had you down as a sherry man.<eos> Most people do.<eos> That's Mr. Staunton's.<eos> Hardly be needing it now, will he?<eos> Stephen drank far too much.<eos> Most of us did, of course.
That's badass.<eos> That is badass.<eos> Yeah, it is badass.<eos> See, look at that- - What do you think of that, Louie?<eos> She likes badasses.<eos> Huh- - What do you think of that?<eos> So-so-So what'd I say?<eos> An ounce per scale, is that what it was?<eos> Actually, you said two ounces.<eos> Oh, I did, did I?
He couldn't have killed Lilian.<eos> I know, because he was with me.<eos> He was in bed with me.<eos> She told you, did she?<eos> Bless her.<eos> She thinks that'll give me an alibi.<eos> But we weren't together all night.<eos> Old Bill will still think I had opportunity.<eos> - Everyone believes you killed her.<eos> - Of course they do.
Where's the ring?<eos> Sorry, can I interrupt?<eos> Marriage is an outdated institution.<eos> I earn a decent wage.<eos> Why would I take an engagement ring?<eos> - To distract us.<eos> - From what?<eos> From what Lilian was about to reveal.<eos> My sister has a pet name for Johnny.<eos> Of course she does.
You've killed.<eos> You were both soldiers.<eos> You both fought.<eos> It was your duty to take lives.<eos> And it is your duty to save them.<eos> My conscience is clear, Mr Chambers.<eos> I doubt even you could say that.<eos> He's a crackpot.<eos> Seems sane enough to me.<eos> The most insane often do.
when the construction was finished, a career shift was, uh.-- the best option-<eos> And that's when the Romans--<eos> - That's all I need to hear!<eos> Hercules!<eos> - Whatever you have in store for me, I hope as a Gaul you'll have the dignity--<eos> - Some nerve to talk of dignity, Julius! - Some nerve?<eos> - This Mansions of the Gods business is not like you!<eos> It's deceitful, underhanded and plain old sneaky!<eos> - What can I say? You get an idea, you try it- Sometimes it works--<eos> - Sometimes it doesn't!
But I guess since it didn't directly affect you, it's a low priority.<eos> It affected me plenty!<eos> Now, we only got so many people here.<eos> We need to put our resources where they can do the most good.<eos> Which you decide.<eos> That's right, branch -- which I decide.<eos> Ridges killed Hector.<eos> That has a direct impact on Henry's trial.<eos> I would've thought that would've mattered to you.<eos> It does.
You get to the point where you have to live with the choices you've made.<eos> The good ones and the bad.<eos> And I accept that.<eos> I'm right there.<eos> This fucking close.<eos> This liquor deal comes through and I'm golden.<eos> Then the trick's to stay alive long enough to cash out.<eos> You haven't the slightest idea what I'm talking about, do you?<eos> Si.<eos> Si, you do, or si, you don't?
- Hello, Junior.<eos> Say, I was hoping to borrow the keys to the Ford.<eos> Why, certainly.<eos> You mean, I can really take the car?<eos> What car?<eos> I said you could borrow the keys.<eos> Gee, you're not still sore at me, are you, pop?<eos> Now why on earth would I be sore?<eos> On account I dented the Fender?<eos> - You did?
People trampled each other to grab it.<eos> Just the sort of thing that amused him.<eos> New Year's Eve, 1923.<eos> The home of Mr. and Mrs. Nucky Thompson.<eos> Tell me again there's no money.<eos> Carolyn, please.<eos> You're hurt and angry.<eos> I understand more than you realize.<eos> But you and I have a great deal in common.<eos> No, we don't, sweetie.
-What?<eos> What'd you call him?<eos> A jerk.<eos> That's a friend you're talking about.<eos> Luciano?<eos> Since we were babies, I know him.<eos> It was a joke.<eos> You like to make jokes.<eos> I like to laugh.<eos> Oh, you do, do you?
I'll see you on there.<eos> To meet you.<eos> Haven't written your sermon.<eos> Please.<eos> Come home.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> I took the liberty of ordering you a sherry.<eos> That's what vicars drink, isn't it?<eos> You must think me a fool.<eos> Of course I don't.
Band of brothers.<eos> People bandy that phrase around, but we really were.<eos> Closer than brothers.<eos> So you served together?<eos> I was his commanding officer.<eos> We were in Italy, Germany near the end.<eos> We were some of the first to liberate Belsen.<eos> Thomas Langshaw...<eos> Did he serve under you, too?<eos> Yes, he did.
I didn't mean to hurt you.<eos> I know you didn't.<eos> I can make them understand.<eos> Your friend, he wasn't supposed to be there. I was just...<eos> I-I know.<eos> You must hate me.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> I don't hate you!<eos> You have a choice, Robert.<eos> We all do.
One more reason to quit.<eos> Uh, no, it's not actual smoke. It's a bunch of small blood vessels that form to compensate for a blockage in the carotid artery.<eos> How did you figure it was moyamoya?<eos> Well, during your solo, I saw you not getting enough oxygen, and hypoxia is not a symptom of Huntington's, so...<eos> So what caused the blockage?<eos> Hard to say for sure, but it might have formed when your dad dropped you from the jungle gym.<eos> So I did get a condition from my father.<eos> Your blood work came back.<eos> Now, I just need to confirm that you want the result of your Huntington's test.<eos> - I do.
When was the last time you saw him, Ruby? This morning.<eos> He left before dawn, like always, to go drop his line and try for a catch of the day.<eos> I got to open that gate, or else I'm gonna totally lose my mind.<eos> Jerry loved the way the light poured in, didn't he?<eos> Remember what he called it?<eos> - The last...<eos> - Slice of sunshine in New York City.<eos> All those Sunday biker brunches.<eos> Who'd think that fried spam on wonder bread could taste so good!<eos> It didn't.
I just... I don't know what I wish.<eos> Wall Street is infested with rich guys in limousines, but I have no idea how we find the right one.<eos> Oh, I know exactly how.<eos> "Limo on a fire hydrant," complete with license plate.<eos> XPD 465.<eos> Oh, thank you, Cyrus Speeler, you weird and wonderful aviculturist.<eos> Limousine owned by Lloyd Kramer. Oh wait.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Do you know who he is?<eos> Because I do!
If they wish to categorize it as such, They should either get a medical degree or another m.E.<eos> Okay.<eos> Also, the parents of the jumper, Vicky hulquist, are here to I.D. The body.<eos> Show them pictures.<eos> [ clears throat ] they want to talk to you.<eos> Lucas, we've been over this.<eos> I never speak with the families.<eos> It's much too emotional.<eos> But they refuse to leave.<eos> I don't -- [ chuckles ]
Is it phenytoin?<eos> - Or some other anticonvulsant?<eos> - I don't have to answer that.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - Dr. Morgan, this is not the time.<eos> Okay, H-Henry, let's go.<eos> This is important.<eos> The case depends on it.<eos> Do you take phenytoin?<eos> Yes, millions of people do.
This room is filled with Degas, Monet, all masterpieces.<eos> And one painting by an unknown Argentinean.<eos> Ah, the Vermeers.<eos> Abigail, this is Gloria.<eos> It's her party.<eos> I think you have someone special here, Abigail.<eos> I think you're right.<eos> Do you have someone special?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
What doesn't belong here?<eos> This.<eos> A painting by an unknown artist.<eos> In the 1950s, Fernando Costa was a young painter on the rise...<eos> Promising, but hardly worthy of this museum.<eos> Only one person could make this happen.<eos> Gloria Carlyle.<eos> And she was in love with him.<eos> Do you have someone special?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm Caitlyn Cook.<eos> - Arthur Campbell.<eos> - Oh, I know who you are.<eos> Everybody knows who you are.<eos> I hear you've been trying to get ahold of Ryan.<eos> Is there something I can help you with while he's out of pocket?<eos> No, thank you Caitlyn.<eos> I can wait till he's back from Brussels.<eos> Ryan's not in Brussels.<eos> - Yes, I did.
But me too.<eos> If I can't help my own friends with their issues, how am I supposed to help total strangers?<eos> Maybe the reason I can't write a personal statement is because I don't belong in grad school, and I shouldn't be a social worker.<eos> Hey.<eos> You'll make a great social worker. No.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Luke.<eos> You did!
- But it doesn't change the fact that my sister's drawings have always been right.<eos> We won't have to go far.<eos> An image search found possibilities in town.<eos> I've got all the red doors here in Zenith.<eos> Personally, I'm thinking the storage space, but if we're really digging into the space-time of it all, the colonial's got that whole Narnia spin.<eos> You said that you saw this in a vision?<eos> They always mean something.<eos> I think that door is the way back into the dome.<eos> Hunter, we need addresses.<eos> No, you don't.
First, we have a problem to solve.<eos> Didn't I already solve it?<eos> We already know how long it's going to take Braxnet Security to respond to the alarm.<eos> I've calculated how many men we need to load the money into the tubes in that amount of time.<eos> 'Cause now we're a man short.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, on the other hand, it's one less share to load.<eos> I don't leave money on the table.<eos> I assume you have a solution.<eos> I do.
This is all going down now!<eos> You said you had a bigger plan.<eos> Where the hell do I fit in?<eos> Let me make this clear.<eos> I am not going to raise our child as a married single mother.<eos> And he's gonna be the first priority in this family.<eos> We have a problem to solve.<eos> Because now, we're a man short.<eos> I assume you have a solution.<eos> I do.
[Laughs maniacally]<eos> Finn, look.<eos> I made this guy dance.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> Whoo! Hold it!<eos> No dancing in the streets without a permit!<eos> Go away, dude.<eos> [Coins clink] All right, I'm going!<eos> [Laughs maniacally] This is crazy.<eos> People do anything for money.
Unfortunately, I have to reschedule. - Why?<eos> - I have court.<eos> Mike's alleging I broke privilege. - Did you?<eos> - Yes, technically, when I told you to move up our timeline.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me.<eos> If you--if you broke privilege, what are you gonna tell the judge?<eos> I don't know, but until I think of something,<eos> I'm going to confuse the shit out of everyone I can.<eos> That doesn't make any sense. - It makes total sense.<eos> - No, it doesn't, Your Honor.
Shut up.<eos> Hey, ref.<eos> Hey, beer guy.<eos> That's six.<eos> Need anything else?<eos> Um, I will let you know.<eos> Wow, beer guy is super hot.<eos> I guess.<eos> If you like that type.<eos> I do.
Which very much sounds as though... it's up to us.<eos> Neither of you are going anywhere.<eos> I've lost my crew.<eos> We were the last astronauts, this is the last shuttle, these are the last nuclear bombs.<eos> We're the last chance for Earth, and you're staying to help me.<eos> Decision made.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is killing the moon?<eos> How can the moon die, though?<eos> Everything does.
I couldn't save Quell, I couldn't save Moorhouse.<eos> There was a good chance that she'd die too.<eos> At which point, I would have just... ..moved onto the next... ..and the next... until I beat it.<eos> Sometimes, the only choices you have are bad ones.<eos> But you still have to choose.<eos> It's quite a vehicle you have here, Doctor.<eos> I won't pretend to understand half of it.<eos> Having said that,<eos> I did notice you've got a couple of drive stacks need replacing.<eos> Oh, you did, did you? Yeah.
And yet you defend him.<eos> I have desperately tried to convince him not to kill you, that the bloodshed in your family does not have to be an endless cycle.<eos> And after centuries on this earth, do you really not see that all of your violence is pointless?<eos> Let me hazard a guess.<eos> You are one of these alienists, right?<eos> We're called therapists these days.<eos> And to be honest, you could do with some couch time.<eos> Actually, my dear, since my wound does not appear to be healing, what I could do with right now is some food.<eos> You... you said you wouldn't.<eos> Yes, I did, didn't I?
You know, I was up all night looking through this, trying to find something, anything that will help me figure out how to get the people back together.<eos> Let me guess... no such luck.<eos> Nothing viable.<eos> And now Ansel's dead along with Ollie, so forgive me if I need a beer because right now, I can use all the help I can get.<eos> I screwed up, you guys.<eos> I was with Kaleb last night, and he took the white oak stake when I was asleep.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I never should have trusted him.<eos> Kol doesn't have the stake.<eos> Klaus does.
I love seeing the expense account put to good use.<eos> Kathryn, nice dress.<eos> Oh, I was just trying not to feel like the out-of-town aunt.<eos> Oh, please. No one here bites...<eos> Except possibly Andrea Askowitz.<eos> Oh, I love her.<eos> She wrote this hilarious memoir about her mother<eos> - called "Battle Axe."<eos> - Ooh, no wonder she bites.<eos> Well, she did a new bio on Edith Wharton.
Dude, moms love me.<eos> Carrie... I'm not introducing you to my moms... until I know this is definitely something real.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't realize that you were fucking... a pretend vagina every night.<eos> They're my moms.<eos> - lt's a big step.<eos> - I'm ready for that.<eos> Wow, okay.<eos> Uh, do they even know I exist?<eos> Yeah, of course they do.
I didn't make up "dick on the table." You said it!<eos> And we...<eos> I told you...<eos> Why are you being like this?<eos> Why are you...<eos> Jesus, Keith.<eos> This is fucking B.S.<eos> I am so sorry. Keith.<eos> - Why can't I do it? ! - Come on, let's go.<eos> You did this!
And we...<eos> I told you...<eos> Why are you being like this?<eos> Why are you...<eos> Jesus, Keith.<eos> This is fucking B.S.<eos> I am so sorry. Keith.<eos> - Why can't I do it? ! - Come on, let's go.<eos> You did this!<eos> You did this!
There's no story.<eos> They change therapists.<eos> What?<eos> You got weird when the doctor brought up her name.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> You did.<eos> I saw you.<eos> What happened?<eos> You two have a thing?<eos> Yeah, we did.
I locked myself out.<eos> - You locked yourself out?<eos> I don't have my shoes on.<eos> - Ah, don't beat yourself up.<eos> It's been a long five days.<eos> Voilà.<eos> Gotta find that key.<eos> This it?<eos> - Oh. I don't remember putting it there.<eos> You don't?
And then all of this happened, and I... I just... ignored all of that.<eos> And now after seeing you again, I...<eos> I just don't know why.<eos> I forgot who you are.<eos> I just, um...<eos> I just want you to know that I would never have hurt Nicholas. I...<eos> I... I loved him.<eos> And, um...<eos> I... I just want you to know that, okay?<eos> I do.
Like Oceans Eleven with women wouldn't work because two would keep breaking off to talk trash about the other nine.<eos> Or not even talk trash...<eos> Just say weird passive-aggressive things while they break into the casino Vault.<eos> Just being like, "oh, I love how you just wear anything."<eos> Mulaney - 01x05 Sweet Jane<eos> Mulaney is filmed in front of a live studio audience, okay?<eos> Well, um, you know what happened to the boy who met the best girl in the world, right?<eos> He lived happily ever after.<eos> You must think I'm such a dork now.<eos> You... you don't?
That is something everyone can not like together.<eos> Hey, is it okay if I bring Jane and my new girlfriend?<eos> Oh, ladies get in free.<eos> Everyone gets in free.<eos> I don't care who you are...<eos> You're gonna fall right off this frickin' moon.<eos> - Good catch.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> I didn't know you liked blues... music.<eos> Oh, I don't.
Yusuf hides behind his words.<eos> Is that what you'll report?<eos> Untrue by an inch... untrue by a mile.<eos> I have no story to tell, Sire.<eos> I believe my friend, Sanga, traveled to Kochkor... but I do not know on whose command... if anyone's.<eos> What are your suspicions?<eos> I must say nothing... for fear that I may condemn an innocent.<eos> All I know...<eos> is someone seeks your head.<eos> Many do, Latin.
No, it isn't about trust.<eos> Well, then why won't you tell me what's going on?<eos> Please, Mom, I don't want to be alone in this.<eos> I don't want to be either.<eos> I've had this sick feeling in my stomach and it won't go away.<eos> A couple of days after Ali went missing,<eos> Jessica came to the house and she was convinced that you had done something to Ali.<eos> She said that?<eos> But she never went to the cops.<eos> Oh, she did.
It wasn't that big of a deal.<eos> I know that it sounds bad when I say that I almost slept over at Ezra's, but nothing was going to happen.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What I just said makes me sound like one of those women who gets pregnant and claims that they have no idea how and that it must have come from a swimming pool.<eos> When Ali disappeared, Mrs. D. told my parents that she thought that I had something to do with it.<eos> Yeah, but she knows who hit Ali over the head.<eos> She knows that it wasn't you.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> You think that your dad...<eos> Yeah, and so does my mom.
- What do you want me to do?<eos> - Uh, this is, uh, just fine.<eos> Tell me how she did it. - Who?<eos> - The most beautiful girl in the world...<eos> Juliette Barnes.<eos> Did she do it like this, hmm?<eos> Don't... don't do that.<eos> You don't like it?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Uh, I-I-I do.

I'm so sorry you had to go there, but for my son's sake, I am so grateful.<eos> I'm sorry about this weekend.<eos> [Sighing] Me too.<eos> You know, today was the original date of our wedding.<eos> Which I guess theoretically means we would be at our reception right now.<eos> Want to dance?<eos> Do you take this woman to be your wife?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You take this man to be your husband?<eos> I do.
Spending time with your new sisters is not boring.<eos> Okay, sage is his sister.<eos> And it's not like I wanted to be here, either.<eos> Where is she, anyway?<eos> My daughter... dance camp.<eos> Can't believe I'm jealous of that.<eos> Okay, listen up.<eos> Rayna thought this would be a good opportunity for some family time, and I happen to agree.<eos> I would think those $1,500 headphones might take the sting out of it for you.<eos> How you two doing?
Okay, good.<eos> What's the bad news?<eos> Made a bigger deal out of your relationship with Deacon than you probably would have hoped.<eos> "Of course I want Deacon to move on.<eos> I want him to be happy. Why hasn't he?<eos> You'll have to ask him."<eos> That's not how... that's not what...<eos> When does this come out?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> - How we doing?
Thank you!<eos> You've reached Layla. Leave a message.<eos> Hey, uh, I can't find you, so, um... I'm just gonna head on home.<eos> You know, if I were you, I wouldn't give up on being a serious musician just yet.<eos> Ah, I'm pretty sure that ship has sailed.<eos> But not for you.<eos> You were incredible today.<eos> Come on, I'll give you a ride.<eos> Yeah, well... if only everybody didn't see me as the girl curious about robot voices.<eos> I don't.
I do. But what I said still stands, too.<eos> Might be the right time for the band to go big, but I'm afraid it's not the right time for me.<eos> I got a family to take care of.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come in, please.<eos> I just wanted to come by and say "thank you."<eos> Sadie called.<eos> I got the gig.<eos> - You did? - Yeah.<eos> You did?
Oh, uh, "ball and chain. "<eos> Luke Wheeler had a big hit with it.<eos> "Ball and chain"?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Oh, it's when you're stuck with somebody.<eos> Like my mom's stuck with me?<eos> Hey, she's not stuck with you, buddy.<eos> She just...<eos> Needed a little breather.<eos> We all do once in a while.
You know what's complicated?<eos> A child.<eos> And neither one of you's got any business raising one.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Come on. Do you even have a plan?<eos> Really?<eos> Or are you just gonna make it up as you go along, like everything else in your life?<eos> Honey, please!<eos> Do you even have a job right now?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What... what was that?<eos> Well, that was a private investigator at work.<eos> - What? - I told you.<eos> I met Annie when I hired her to do a background check on my nanny.<eos> - Uh, no, actually, you didn't. - Oh, sorry.<eos> I guess mommy brain?<eos> Are you saying you knew we'd be trespassing?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I-I assumed that she had permission.<eos> - Well, she didn't.
Please sit down.<eos> It'll be very important that you're here for Amy's progress.<eos> Amy?<eos> Mom...<eos> What's the issue you've been having with your computer?<eos> Oh, I just wanted to e-mail that cute picture of you and your sister to your uncle...<eos> - It's this way.<eos> - ... Pat, but the photos just disappeared.<eos> I just think that machines don't work around me.<eos> They don't.
Exactly, you know, but instead of playing with a rook, - I swallowed one.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> "What is your favorite sexual position?"<eos> Okay, actually like eight people wrote the same one.<eos> But before she lets me answer, she wants me to know,<eos> "Mine is doggy style, hits the G spot."<eos> I know!<eos> This is what happens when you're a pretty girl.<eos> Everyone, like, tells you what you say is interesting and important and you get really confused.<eos> No one ever did that to me.
Don't you recognize anything here?<eos> When you were very little, I brought you here often, that you might not begin your life as a damned puritan, without the sounds, the music in your ears, or all the colors of art in your eyes.<eos> Here.<eos> You drew that when you were 3.<eos> This.<eos> Well, that was your favorite.<eos> I carved it for you.<eos> But why... Why can't I remember?<eos> Because I had to take away your memories until you were ready for them, but now you are.<eos> I do.
- He's not your friend, Rabbit.<eos> - He was using us.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> He made a video saying that you wanted to hurt - a lot of people. - We could show it to you.<eos> - Why would we lie to you?<eos> - Because you want to shut me down for good and never wake me up, exactly like he told me.<eos> - I don't want to shut you down for good. - Yes, you do.<eos> You're afraid of what's happening to me.<eos> And Mom doesn't love me. Your mom loves you.<eos> We-we both do.
I don't believe you. Ethan, come on.<eos> Just stop this...<eos> Ethan, where... where'd you get that?<eos> Odin gave it to me.<eos> He told me to call him if you were gonna shut me down.<eos> That he'd come get me. Ethan, give me that phone.<eos> No!<eos> Hey, I just want to see it.<eos> You don't want me to call him. You're right.<eos> I-I don't.
But it could be something else.<eos> Something else, like what?<eos> Well, let's find out.<eos> Well, the node is easily enough removed.<eos> That looks like ink. It is.<eos> Tattoo ink.<eos> During the tattoo process, it's deposited in the dermis.<eos> Microphages digest it, and then migrate into the closest lymph nodes.<eos> But she doesn't have any tattoos.<eos> She doesn't now, but she did at some point.
Did you read it?<eos> What the hell is she doing?<eos> She's defending you.<eos> None of this is true.<eos> But it's good for you.<eos> You never had the phone, and now Griffin has a motive.<eos> If he knew Lila was cheating on him... - He didn't.<eos> - [ Sighs ] You don't know that.<eos> I-I do.<eos> We both do.
Or is it the proof prosecutors needed to show Mr. O'Reilly had motive for killing his girlfriend?<eos> Damn.<eos> I was hoping I'd get to be the first one to tell you.<eos> You like the new wallpaper?<eos> It's the only thing left that tied you to the photo.<eos> Unless of course there's someone else out there knows what your penis looks like.<eos> Why you doing all this for me?<eos> I'm not angry.<eos> I just...<eos> - Don't...
And I think Rose and her young man will take up every scrap of attention we have for weddings.<eos> Please don't say that.<eos> Papa!<eos> Larry's been sitting in the car since he left the dining room.<eos> I'm just coming.<eos> I'll say goodnight to Mrs Crawley.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Don't blame Larry.<eos> He was close to his mother and hates the thought of a replacement.<eos> - They both do.
- How? I'm still working on that part.<eos> This is stupid.<eos> What are we looking for if we don't know what we're looking for?<eos> We're looking for a bus, Jakes.<eos> Stop drinking if you're gonna be here.<eos> Is not being here an option? Yeah, Dale, it is.<eos> You didn't have to come back.<eos> And pass up on an oceanside mansion with free rent?<eos> You don't even like the ocean.<eos> No, I really don't.
I-I didn't see him that much. I, um... I canceled lunch last month for no good reason.<eos> I did talk to him, uh, before the speeches. He had a few, but, uh... that was standard operating for Dave.<eos> He did, though, seem... kind of preoccupied.<eos> (sighs) I don't know, 25 years, you know... it's, uh, he was best man at my wedding.<eos> He and Brighty flipped for it.<eos> Eliot, if you need to take some time...<eos> Yeah, I don't... (sighing) I don't know how much good I can do here.<eos> I just, uh... We're gonna find who did this.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> I do.
Listen!<eos> You have to let me out.<eos> This rain...<eos> I know how to stop it, and nobody else will get hurt.<eos> If you untie me, it'll be like you're helping me to stop it.<eos> So help me.<eos> Help me stop it, Lyle.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> I don't want to stop the rain.<eos> And neither does the dome.
But you can't greet Nicki like this.<eos> You look like a dude just waiting for sex.<eos> Are you really trying to help me right now, or are you just messing with my head?<eos> Why can't it be both?<eos> Justin?<eos> Justin!<eos> I don't want...<eos> I don't want to have sex.<eos> That... that... that came out wrong.<eos> I do.
[Italian accent] Excuse-a me, move?<eos> Yes, yes, just like that... like you're holding a tiny mouse and talking to the mouse.<eos> - Excuse-a me, move.<eos> - Hey, hey.<eos> Right now, maybe the move is-a busy with someone else.<eos> - You have another customer, so you...<eos> - What can I do, move?<eos> What can I do?<eos> Maybe sing to the move.<eos> Maybe do a singing to the move.
What do I care about those people?<eos> They don't even know what a McLaren is.<eos> A man who hasn't worked in almost a year lights himself on fire, and you're laughing about it?<eos> Lighten up, little cousin.<eos> You're not being very fun right now.<eos> I want to dance.<eos> What do you think, baby?<eos> You want to dance?<eos> Uh, no, I don't think so.<eos> Yeah, you do.
They need you, ezra.<eos> They need you right now.<eos> Listen.<eos> Our crew boarded that transport to selflessly rescue imperial prisoners.<eos> They have no idea they walked into a trap, no idea what's coming.<eos> You need to go warn them, ezra.<eos> No, it's too late for them, hera.<eos> - We should run now, while...<eos> - you don't mean that.<eos> I do.
I-I don't know.<eos> You better pull it back, Joe. Pull it back.<eos> I'm-I'm trying, but it won't come back up.<eos> I thought you said you knew how to fly it. I do!<eos> Damn it.<eos> We've lost the signal.<eos> I'm sorry, Julia.<eos> It's my own fault.<eos> When you guys started talking about tunnels, I just really wanted... I really wanted to believe there was a chance.<eos> We all did.
Here we go.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> Hey!<eos> Need a little help here!<eos> - Oh, my God. Is that Lyle? - Yeah.<eos> - Fished him out of the lake.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Waves of flames... a thousand feet up...<eos> Did you find any fuel?<eos> Yes, I did.
There's no need to be afraid.<eos> Careful.<eos> All right, Carolyn.<eos> Stop.<eos> - The cracks are getting wider.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> You're fine, you're fine.<eos> All right, everybody, watch your step, all right?<eos> We'll help you across.<eos> Okay, how we doing?
You were his colleague.<eos> Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, you could be very frugal.<eos> I'm getting a little tired of everybody's sarcasm.<eos> I'm not a bully.<eos> I mean, maybe I come off a little strong, but that's only because my dad raised me to be tough and not to take crap from anybody. No.<eos> That's fine, but there's a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper.<eos> I did say that, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, you did.
_<eos> _<eos> Thank you for saving my life.<eos> Not yet, I haven't.<eos> Your roommates miss you.<eos> Do you have a plan?<eos> Absolutely I have a plan.<eos> You don't...<eos> - do you?<eos> - Of course I do.
Here we are again.<eos> Listen... - I'd like to ask you something.<eos> - Yes. - But you might be busy.<eos> - No, I'm free.<eos> - I haven't told you what day yet.<eos> - What day ?<eos> - Saturday.<eos> - I'm free.<eos> - Would you like to come to a party ?<eos> I do.
- We'll put the "screensy" here.<eos> - The "screensy" ?<eos> - Here.<eos> - Thanks for your help.<eos> - We'll put the bonsai here.<eos> - Can you manage ?<eos> Get these panels up. - This goes here.<eos> - Here we are. - Pull your pants up !<eos> - Don't like it ?<eos> - No, I don't.
What've you got for me?<eos> Two fat pigs and a fine goat.<eos> Hello.<eos> That's two fat pigs and a fine goat.<eos> We'll see you tonight.<eos> You'll join me for a dram?<eos> - Aye!<eos> - Good.<eos> I thought you said no pigs.<eos> Aye, I did, didn't I?
I'm not who I think I am. Mccombs:<eos> There is no martin odum. He doesn't exist. Martin:<eos> I want the truth, damn it! You said<eos> It was all in my head, but it's not, is it? You've been lying to me.<eos> Rice:<eos> Not until we find this guy.<eos> I reached out to a friend of mine at the treasury.<eos> I gave him the serial numbers of some of the cash we found.<eos> Yeah?<eos> He did a trace.
Yes, I did. But I...<eos> But what?<eos> Sounds like someone's been drinking her boyfriend's Kool-Aid.<eos> Well, maybe if more people did, there just might be...<eos> Oh, goddamn it, Rachel.<eos> I'm not in business to save the world.<eos> I asked for a professional opinion.<eos> And I gave you a professional opinion.<eos> You just don't like it.<eos> No, I don't.
No, no, no. No, no, no.<eos> You once told me that my actions have consequences. Remember?<eos> Your actions yesterday have consequences, too.<eos> What did you say to Gianopolous?<eos> Not much.<eos> Just that you were the person responsible for his number two leaving him.<eos> I was responsible?<eos> He agreed to it.<eos> Well, what he didn't know was that it was his own lawyer who came up with the idea.<eos> Now, he does.
I just lifted some prints from the door.<eos> Someone stole a corpse?<eos> I know.<eos> Pretty sick, right?<eos> So, what do you have here?<eos> Less than we thought if we don't get Ridges' body back.<eos> Taillight's out.<eos> It wasn't 10 seconds ago.<eos> You mind popping that trunk?<eos> Yes, I do.
Why, Doctor Oswald, you are hilarious!<eos> Could we get back to work, do you think?<eos> What are you exactly?<eos> You don't smell like police but that's some pretty cool gear you got there.<eos> You like a spy, or something?<eos> Oh, he's a bright one, hang on to him!<eos> He was the last one to go missing.<eos> And when he disappeared all the doors and windows were locked from the inside.<eos> 'Ooh, now you're talking. I love a good locked room mystery.'<eos> Yeah, doesn't everyone?
A tree is a time machine.<eos> Plant a little acorn in 1795, and in 2016, there's an oak tree, there, in the same spot with a tiny little bit of 1795 still alive inside of it.<eos> You can't create an overnight forest with extra special fertiliser.<eos> You have to mess with the fabric of time.<eos> And communicate... with trees.<eos> So, you're saying it's an act of aggression?<eos> By trees?<eos> Er, trees clean the air.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Well done, Ruby.
Meanwhile, you upgrade the bodies.<eos> Upload the mind, upgrade the body.<eos> Cybermen from cyberspace.<eos> Now, why has no-one ever thought of that before?<eos> How did you get hold of Time Lord technology?<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know who I am.<eos> I told you.<eos> You felt it.<eos> Surely you did.
This is who the Doctor is.<eos> Watch the blood-soaked old general in action.<eos> I can't see properly, sir, because this needs activating.<eos> If you want to know what's coming, you have to switch... it... on.<eos> And didn't all of those beautiful speeches just disappear in the face of a tactical advantage?<eos> Sir?<eos> I need to know.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
I want to see if your eyebrows drop off.<eos> All of this...<eos> All of it, just to give me an army?<eos> Well, I don't need one, do I?<eos> Armies are for people who think they're right.<eos> And nobody thinks they're righter than you!<eos> Give a good man firepower, and he'll never run out of people to kill.<eos> I don't want an army.<eos> Well, that's the trouble!<eos> Yes, you do!
This is a list of all of Melikov's known associates.<eos> You're gonna talk to anybody that knows these guys and find out where they were today, okay? Go on.<eos> Go do it.<eos> Hey, I think I remember where I saw that car from this morning.<eos> Do you remember that, uh, housing complex we had to help clear out?<eos> - Martin Grove.<eos> - Yeah, it's gone.<eos> It's already been demo'd. Whoa.<eos> But we were wearing body cams that day.<eos> Yes, we did.
So c... come on, let's just hit the road.<eos> Please?<eos> You're my friend, right, Rush?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm-I'm your friend.<eos> None of them are.<eos> Max, Max!<eos> Forget about them.<eos> They don't understand people like us.<eos> - They really don't, do they?
- OK.<eos> - I got him. Mm-hmm.<eos> Um, thanks for...<eos> - thanks for not saying anything.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I love him.<eos> You don't even know him.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I... you must've loved Jax when you were together.<eos> I still do.
Wait. What are you talking about?<eos> The SEC called Sidwell, and I guarantee you they also called Logan Sanders, which means Harvey can't use those shares, and I'm in the driver's seat.<eos> - Well, that explains it.<eos> - Explains what?<eos> Harvey just called.<eos> He wants to have a meeting.<eos> - Jeff.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Did you hear what Sean Cahill did this morning?<eos> I did.
Who do you think bought that Wexler block three days ago?<eos> I don't give a shit who bought it three days ago.<eos> 'Cause it just went back on the market 30 minutes ago, and you're looking at the man who owns it now.<eos> Jonathan, what are you doing here?<eos> Forstman bought the Wexler shares.<eos> What?<eos> They went back on the market, and he snatched them right up.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> We win.<eos> - We do.
He'll understand that you're no longer a credible witness, that you probably can't take the stand if we indict, and that there's a good chance you screwed up his whole case, not just the girl.<eos> I can't just leave her down there.<eos> You can.<eos> That's the only thing you can do.<eos> I told her I'd come back for her.<eos> You lied.<eos> You lie for a living.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The ballerina didn't used to spin.<eos> Now it does.
Paige, I got a letter verifiably handled by your girl sent from out of state that her own sister swore she wrote.<eos> No.<eos> People believe what they want to believe.<eos> - Yeah, no shit. - Don't you see?<eos> This is what he wants.<eos> You know, there's a version of this where you're happy.<eos> Because it means somewhere in Scottsdale, Arizona your girl's alive.<eos> [Spanish radio announcer]<eos> Do you like [Speaking Spanish], Johnny?<eos> Nah, no, I don't, man.
Well, maybe you should tell us where this is.<eos> You know, just in case anything were to happen to you.<eos> Good-bye, hanna.<eos> Be careful please.<eos> I will.<eos> Aria's right.<eos> If you identify this guy, it will be way too easy For "a" to prove that you're lying.<eos> We don't even know who this cyrus person is Or where he came from.<eos> I get it, em.<eos> Okay? I do.
I hate to break it to you, but... she's your girlfriend.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You're up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like we're both working late.<eos> Yeah, I caught a call on my way out the--you don't care.<eos> No, I do.
Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You're up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like we're both working late.<eos> Yeah, I caught a call on my way out the--you don't care.<eos> No, I do.<eos> You do, since when?
Oh, what happened in there, guys?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know what that was.<eos> I taught her everything she knows.<eos> I owe you.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's the one, that's the one.<eos> What-- okay, that spin doesn't count.<eos> This game is rigged.<eos> Yes, it does.
So, I hear there's a good chance you could become team captain.<eos> That's very impressive for a junior.<eos> Hey, what're you doing tonight?<eos> I have a science poster to do, and then they just slammed us with a bunch of English reading.<eos> Well, I know that I'm not as exciting as either of those, but I was hoping that we could do something.<eos> You and me?<eos> Like a date?<eos> As in a date, yes.<eos> But you want me to bring Carter?<eos> No, I don't.
Since today, actually.<eos> Okay, well, at least it's not serious. It is serious.<eos> You don't know what kind of life he's led.<eos> I'm sure it's been tough, - and maybe it's to blame for what he's become.<eos> - Maybe?<eos> But it doesn't matter anymore, because now it's who he is.<eos> How can you even say that?<eos> That boy has had no one to believe in him...<eos> Ever.<eos> Now he does.
You said I couldn't say anything to you if I'm your friend, so I didn't.<eos> But I also can't be your friend if you're with Lori, so where does that leave me?<eos> In my room.<eos> Yes.<eos> Your room.<eos> Hello.<eos> May I take your coat?<eos> Hey, whoa.<eos> That shirt looks great on you. Yeah.<eos> Better than it does on me.
- You're back.<eos> According to the FBI, this is where I live now.<eos> Was it fun to see your friends?<eos> Yeah, loads of fun.<eos> Even made a new one.<eos> Guy in a silver Subaru who sat in his car all day watching me.<eos> My God.<eos> I hope you got his license.<eos> As a matter of fact,<eos> I did.
Okay, well...<eos> Let me know if you find anything.<eos> Absolutely, I'll look into this.<eos> Carter wants yogurt.<eos> Great.<eos> Go, have fun.<eos> I know.<eos> Hey, yo, try some Fro-Yo.<eos> Do you know what you want?<eos> Um, yeah, yeah, I do.
He put it online.<eos> He took the money from the Hale Vault, then turned the bearer bonds into cash.<eos> He made the payments.<eos> Was it Brunski's idea to fake your death?<eos> Did he get nervous because you helped us with one of the cipher keys?<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> All you ever wanted to do was help.<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> I know you wouldn't want to be here if you didn't want to talk.<eos> I do.
~ I don't know anything because you haven't told me anything, which means I wouldn't approve, which means you are endangering this school.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's a scanner.<eos> I'm scanning.<eos> Why do I keep you around?<eos> Because the alternative would be developing a conscience of your own.<eos> Scanning for what?<eos> Any alien technology in this vicinity should show up.<eos> I used to have a teacher exactly like you once.<eos> You still do.
Technically, that is true.<eos> That is true technically.<eos> Is there not to be an intercession?<eos> No, I don't believe there should be.<eos> You do not speak for the library.<eos> Is there not to be an intercession?<eos> Intercess all you want, mate, as long as I'm intercessing with my double cheese, extra pep.<eos> I'm assuming he doesn't have my pizza on him.<eos> No.<eos> No, he does not.
No good came of it.<eos> And over the years, I chose again and again.<eos> Each time, a little hope, lots of blood.<eos> But nothing really changed.<eos> I finally learned my lesson.<eos> And I came here just to do my work alone...<eos> Because why choose?<eos> Nothing... oh, God.<eos> Nothing... ever changes.<eos> You did.
You still under or what?<eos> It would appear that Carlito has feelings for Johnny.<eos> - Feelings, feelings?<eos> - Feelings, feelings.<eos> Man, we don't know that for sure.<eos> So you're still under?<eos> Maybe we can use this.<eos> Do you think you can get Carlito to pick up tomorrow's shipment?<eos> He's too smart for that.<eos> He never does his own pickups.
Where is he?<eos> Fun fact, we have no idea.<eos> Fun fact, I got a warrant for his arrest.<eos> - On what charge?<eos> - At the moment, kidnapping.<eos> I anticipate an upgrade to murder, but that's just me.<eos> We've become aware of certain emails and texts he sent to Rose Marquez.<eos> Threatening ones.<eos> If you know where he is, you should tell us.<eos> We don't.
She had too much to drink at Launch Day. She came out here for a midnight swim like we all did when we were kids... - Hmm!<eos> - Only she slipped. Like Dr. Bryce said, an accident.<eos> Take her to the medical centre.<eos> She's been out here way too long.<eos> You really believe this wasn't an accident?<eos> Look, I know it may sound crazy...<eos> I want you to look into it.<eos> If there is the slightest chance, we need to be sure.<eos> Captain, I don't have any experience with anything like this.<eos> Nobody does.
So I didn't eat.<eos> I just let him order whatever he wanted.<eos> He was in the middle of telling me a really good story about his school, how he... came in second place in the triple jump at Sports Day.<eos> He even had a little medal.<eos> So, what happened to him then?<eos> A bomb went off... he was wiped off the face of the earth!<eos> And you let the people who did it get away.<eos> Well... if we did, I'm sorry.<eos> I know that you have the computers and my hard drives.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Pick up a bottle of wine. (giggles)<eos> Get that bread you like, with the cheese.<eos> We could head down to the water and...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe.<eos> That'd be nice.<eos> Let someone else be cops for a while. Oh...<eos> You've done enough.<eos> Give Jo time to find the antidote, let us all take over.<eos> What if she doesn't?
At least until we know the antidote is working.<eos> I have to know I did my best for you.<eos> You've always done your best for me.<eos> And taking me to the hospital won't prove that.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> You want a room, or, uh... you want to catch a killer? Hmm...<eos> Since your memory's gotten a little shaky, I've been trying to come up with my own version of what you do.<eos> So I went back to the Goodacre interview, and I looked at what motivated you to turn and head for the door.<eos> You guys were talking about private military contractors.<eos> So I did a search of PMC's in that region of Nigeria during the time of the oil spill.
I'd like to introduce you to my friend Becca.<eos> - Charlie, Becca.<eos> Becca, Charlie.<eos> - Hey, Charlie. - Hi. - This is Lilly.<eos> Lilly, nice to meet you.<eos> She's a really big Blood Sisters fan.<eos> Huge.<eos> Seriously, last week when you stabbed Sebastian after he kissed you and stole your life force?<eos> I did not see that coming.<eos> Oh, my God, nobody did.
You're right.<eos> Probably one of his minions.<eos> A lowly demon that Will summoned from Beelzebub to help him get whatever it was he wanted from Talmadge.<eos> Demons don't need help getting past security systems, and the devil doesn't need to use the door.<eos> I'm gonna take another look at that security-cam footage from Will's apartment.<eos> - Where's the DVD?<eos> - What DVD?<eos> I put a DVD of security footage in this evidence box. Where is it?<eos> Ain't in there, you didn't put it in there.<eos> The hell I didn't.
I killed him because he killed my mom.<eos> Your mother committed suicide.<eos> No, he made her do that, all right? !<eos> She... she was fine before, okay?<eos> And my mother...<eos> I never got the chance to tell her...<eos> I said some really terrible things to her.<eos> Listen to me, Connor.<eos> I'm a mother, and I promise you, your mother knew you were sorry.<eos> No, she didn't.
Cold spots it is.<eos> You stay here... keep an eye on Miss Peacock and Colonel Mustard.<eos> I'll sniff around.<eos> For your information, I already own a big, beautiful yacht.<eos> -Is that what you call that thing?<eos> -Fine. It's a mahogany sunfish.<eos> Hey. Gotta say, for a family that just lost two members, you a seem fine.<eos> Well, Sam. I'll let you in on a little family secret.<eos> We don't really like each other.<eos> Then again, what family does?
You're looking for an isotope with a large neutron capture cross section.<eos> At least 2.2 times 10 to the 6th barns.<eos> There's iodine-135.<eos> - 6% of fission by-product.<eos> - And highly unstable.<eos> It could be breaking down into something else.<eos> Xenon?<eos> 135 would have an enormous neutron absorption cross section.<eos> I've studied the xenon isotopes. 135 doesn't exist.<eos> Neither did a continuous nuclear reactor until today.
It's been a long time.<eos> And as you can see, I've missed you.<eos> You need to come see me more often.<eos> That was like an explosion.<eos> A presidential explosion?<eos> A presidential eruption.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Do you think the people love me?<eos> Well, the people don't know you.<eos> But if they did,
No.<eos> We-well... at one time, maybe.<eos> But after our boy died, we...<eos> Well, we were business partners at best.<eos> When I was in jail, penniless... she left me.<eos> Her loss.<eos> Don't make the love stop.<eos> Does it get any easier?<eos> No.<eos> Indeed, no, it does not.
For He commands us to love our God, as well as our neighbor.<eos> Do you love your God?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you love your neighbor?<eos> Yes.<eos> I did not love my neighbor this week.<eos> I sat in judgment on my fellow man.<eos> I reveled in the pit of my own self-righteousness.<eos> So I deserve to be cast out into darkness, and I do not deserve salvation.<eos> None of us does.
Obviously they weren't murdered on the premises, and you're still looking for them, so it must mean they were kidnapped, which is why my client provides valet service, to encourage safety.<eos> You still have I.C.E. on your speed dial?<eos> Of course.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's go show Commander McGinnis that you're not just a paper pusher.<eos> Mr. Tariiji's heart breaks for their families, but he's not responsible for their absence.<eos> Mr. Tariiji, I'm captain Raydor.<eos> This is Deputy Chief Howard, and we're here to discuss your visa issues.<eos> My client has no visa issues.<eos> He does now.
- What?<eos> Terrorism Prevention...<eos> - And if I call the police...?<eos> Of course. Here use my phone.<eos> The number's 999.<eos> No.<eos> Actually... I'll use our phones.<eos> If you think that's best.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do!
No, no.<eos> That can't be...<eos> Philip's alive?<eos> Ian, let me protect you.<eos> You're in great danger where you are.<eos> You, Becky, Grant.<eos> You're all in danger.<eos> - Let me help you. - What do you mean, "Becky"?<eos> I didn't say Becky was with us.<eos> Yes, you did.
Does my father know about this?<eos> Alex, how much does my father know?<eos> Everything.<eos> He's been keeping her for years. Outside the walls, in the Luxor.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> Because he's been having a relationship with her.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> She did.
What the hell is this?<eos> Your stop.<eos> This ain't no stop!<eos> Hey, what are you doing?<eos> Get your...<eos> Get your hands off me!<eos> You're a dead man!<eos> Do you... you know who I am?<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I do.
I ordered you pie.<eos> - Pecan.<eos> - I have a nut allergy.<eos> Too bad.<eos> Have mine.<eos> - It's rhubarb.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Tart. I like it.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> Detective Cross does.
It hurts a lot.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Fix me again.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> No, I can't give you any more.<eos> You'll die from an o.D.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Of course you do.
Hello?<eos> ♪ I'm warning you.<eos> I'm armed.<eos> And I'm... I'm very toned.<eos> Just in case you were wondering where this is... It's uh... I'll put it right there.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tell me again why I took the boards off the windows?<eos> Something about maturity, growing up and taking control.<eos> I am so wrecked.<eos> Hey, did we...?
You send more pictures, and I'll send you more clothes.<eos> Oh, you drive a hard bargain, Lorena, but you know what?<eos> You got a deal.<eos> - Adios.<eos> - Adios. Seems like you and Lorena are getting close.<eos> She's been wonderful to Sashi.<eos> And it's been nice for me too as a mother.<eos> Everything I want now I want as a mother.<eos> And what I want for Sashi is for her to feel the presence and the tradition of her family, her whole family.<eos> Yeah, of course you do.
It'll be a lot less rough if you loop me in.<eos> Or Ethan.<eos> Or anyone.<eos> There's nothing to be looped in about.<eos> Look, if you don't cheer up, you're gonna leave me no choice.<eos> - Nomes...<eos> - Hmm?<eos> I'm not playing this game.<eos> Ah!<eos> - No, don't, okay?
Let's ask him.<eos> Hey, don't hold back.<eos> Nobody's going inside.<eos> What are you... I got a fight.<eos> Anyone who doesn't belong here should go.<eos> This is harassment.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> You killed Bobby and Abe.<eos> You must have some pretty good evidence to make a charge like that.<eos> We do.
- What's going on?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> Somebody slashed this inflatable snowman.<eos> - Well, it wasn't me.<eos> - Now listen here, sonny.<eos> I've won this contest three years in a row and I never had any problem with vandals until you decided to enter.<eos> So be warned,<eos> I will sit up all night to protect my decorations and my property.<eos> And anyone who trespasses will have me and the end of a baseball bat to contend with.<eos> - You didn't... ?
Don't you mean an abundant debt, Mom?<eos> I mean, after all, isn't that how you were able to afford electric skateboards and extravagant beds that we don't even want?<eos> We're getting electric skateboards?<eos> It wasn't extravagant. It was a wedding gift. - OK.<eos> Just inappropriate.<eos> - Stef, come on.<eos> I mean, a bed is a very personal thing.<eos> And not only did you buy us a bed without asking us, but you got rid of the one that we love.<eos> Look, if you don't like the bed, please...<eos> We don't.
For what, for a lousy payday!<eos> Not a payday.<eos> It's my ticket out.<eos> Of what?<eos> A.R.G.U.S.!<eos> You don't know the things waller's made me do.<eos> The person she turns you into.<eos> That still gives you no right To put a bulls-eye on my family's back!<eos> I had no choice.<eos> But you do, john.
I'm attempting to bake, and I ran out.<eos> This your son?<eos> James.<eos> He's such a cutie.<eos> Looks just like you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's Judith, right?<eos> Is it?<eos> Yes. Yes. It is, but you can call me Judy.<eos> All my friends do.
Summer of '94, I smoked my first joint to "Porcelain Gods." (laughs):<eos> In Jonas Morris's brother's room, up above his parents' garage.<eos> AndI hadmy firstthreesome with Jenny Rubin and Kimby Carter, listening to "White Rabbit Radio."<eos> "No Looking Back"?<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> Can't this thing go any faster?<eos> RUSH:<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> How you doing?
We're waiting for the autopsy, but until we figure out cause of death, we're investigating it as a possible homicide.<eos> Tell us what happened last night.<eos> How'd you hurt your wrist?<eos> I fell.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> Whoa, looks like the bad guy's winning.<eos> He always does.<eos> That doesn't seem right.<eos> Why don't you let the good guy win?<eos> Because he doesn't.
I'm sorry.<eos> Sara Fisher, wife of your Vic... - Yeah.<eos> - Just reported somebody attacking at her house.<eos> Units en route. Thank you.<eos> Come in.<eos> Good to have you back, Captain.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Got a minute? Sure.<eos> Have you, um... have you had the chance to read the report of when you got shot?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I know you said to stay put. Aliens were on us.<eos> We had to get out of there.<eos> No, you did the right thing.<eos> Agreed. Very impressive, soldier.<eos> Hal?<eos> Dad? !<eos> Ben?<eos> Dad!<eos> Where have you been?<eos> How did you...
Did Frank say anything to you about Reed?<eos> He said that Reed was the most brilliant man he'd ever met.<eos> Ma'am, the car's out front.<eos> Take care of Frank.<eos> He's on the throne now.<eos> That's what really killed Reed, you know?<eos> The Gadget.<eos> I don't know how many different ways I can say this.<eos> Even if I had known about an inside man in Werner Heisenberg's staff...<eos> - Which you didn't.

Oh. Do you want me to try?<eos> Jimmy: What?<eos> Gretchen: Shh. Let me think.<eos> Jimmy: Come on, this is stupid.<eos> Gretchen:<eos> Shut up. I have been walking around all day in these new shoes, and they are just so... hot and tight.<eos> Jimmy:<eos> That happens.<eos> Gretchen: I think I might just have to take them off.<eos> Jimmy: You do that.
She said that the money would come.<eos> The master bedroom!<eos> We were gonna grow old together in that house, you know, raise a family, be happy.<eos> - Break it in?<eos> - Break it in!<eos> And that's what I wanted.<eos> Really good.<eos> It was the American dream, if that even exists anymore.<eos> But that day, I totally believed in it.<eos> We both did.
You had a lousy father.<eos> I mean he was weak.<eos> I-I mean you are not.<eos> I-I mean you're strong.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I hope it.<eos> [ sighs ] Look...<eos> I just need a night here before I continue my journey, But I'll stay tomorrow and help, if that's what you want.<eos> Just meet me in the morning at the barn, And we can continue training.<eos> But if you don't...
Right.<eos> I just have one.<eos> Say hello. Don't do it.<eos> Now, my daughter's in trouble,<eos> And I need to find the person that can help her...<eos> Someone you branded.<eos> I branded a lot of people.<eos> Her name was Anna. She went by "Joan" back then.<eos> Do I look like I keep a record book?<eos> 'Cause I don't.
Neil Truman.<eos> Gentlemen...<eos> I can't stand here and say that a dating application was the result I had in mind when our two companies began our dialogue.<eos> But then, Victor came to my house yesterday, because that's the kind of diligent managing partner we have here at bastion.<eos> And he asked me if I could overcome my disappointment, if I could let go of that perfect application that I had bouncing around inside my head for so many weeks, and to move on.<eos> And so I considered letting it go.<eos> But then I changed my mind.<eos> I don't exactly work that way.<eos> There is no result that we can offer our customers that will meet their expectations, and they know that.<eos> At least the rational ones do.
- Well, she's not going in the pipeline.<eos> - I'm not suggesting she go in the pipeline, But were she to remain at S.T.A.R. Labs, It would put all of us at risk.<eos> - From who?<eos> Eiling?<eos> - Eiling is a dangerous man, barry.<eos> We do not want him as an enemy.<eos> - After the lighting bolt, what if you hadn't found me? It could've been me.<eos> Hunted, on the run, cut off from everyone I know and care about.<eos> You guys saved me. - And I want to save her just as bad as you do, barry.<eos> We all do.
Watching each breath they take, praying it won't be their last.<eos> To hold your daughter's hand, trying to memorize what it feels like so you won't forget.<eos> Your daughter too scared to close her eyes, even when she's so tired, because she's worried she won't be able to open them again.<eos> Some things you just can't fix.<eos> You got to live with them.<eos> You don't take innocent lives.<eos> We shouldn't be listening to this.<eos> That man deserved to die.<eos> They all deserved to feel my pain!<eos> No, they didn't.
Thank you.<eos> Simon.<eos> I think I'm ready for round two.<eos> Couldn't get in touch with my accountant.<eos> He's got all my files.<eos> Brought you everything I had at home.<eos> Hey.<eos> Did Grace ever get that job?<eos> She mentioned something about a presentation or something a while back.<eos> She did, didn't she?
- MACIE-LYNN?<eos> - I MAY HAVE HAD SEX WITH THEM ALSO.<eos> - AND IF YOU DID, IT WAS CONSENSUAL, ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SHAKIR?<eos> - YES, ABSOLUTELY.<eos> I MEAN, SO I WASN'T ALL WARM AND CUDDLY AFTERWARDS.<eos> I LIKE SLEEPING ALONE.<eos> YOU KNOW, SPENDING THE NIGHT, SPOONING, IT'S NOT PART OF THE SHAKIR WILKINS EXPERIENCE.<eos> - CAN'T BLAME YOU THERE.<eos> NOW BY THE WAY, DO YOU HAVE A PRESCRIPTION FOR AMBIEN OR XANAX?<eos> - YES, OF COURSE I DO.
- I'M TESTIFYING HERE TODAY BECAUSE I MADE A WRONG DECISION, AND FOR THAT, I APOLOGIZE.<eos> - BUT NO CHARGES HAVE BEEN FILED.<eos> - CORRECT.<eos> - AT THE TIME THESE COMPLAINANTS CAME FORWARD, DID YOU BELIEVE THEIR STORIES?<eos> - NO, I DID NOT.<eos> I SIMPLY COULDN'T THINK THAT THE MAN I KNEW WAS CAPABLE OF DOING THE THINGS THEY SAID HE WAS DOING.<eos> - BUT NOW YOU DO BELIEVE THAT SHAKIR WILKINS ASSAULTED THESE THREE WOMEN?<eos> - YES, I DO.<eos> AS I SAID, AFTER THAT SCENE IN THE ELEVATOR WITH CARLA, REPLAYING ALL THEIR WORDS WITHOUT BLINDERS ON, SO GOD HELP ME, YES, I DO.<eos> - DOES THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN YOUR BELIEFS
Yeah, sure.<eos> You still look good in my jackets, too.<eos> What do you mean, still?<eos> Who're you texting, Sadie?<eos> It's Sergio.<eos> He is such an idiot!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You like him.<eos> Disgusting!<eos> I do not.
- I think you should stop whining.<eos> I'm just saying, what if Lin ain't moving his shit today?<eos> What if you stopped asking questions?<eos> What if you weren't such a dick?<eos> What if, when we're done here, we go to your house and I rape your mama?<eos> What if you find her on top of your dad slamming a big black dildo in his ass while he's calling out my name?<eos> - Nice touch.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> How'd you know I was here?<eos> I didn't.
That what I do here, no matter what anybody says, it's not a leisure activity.<eos> I got no interest in kids.<eos> I like women.<eos> It's a business.<eos> You know that.<eos> I remember.<eos> 50 pence subs.<eos> This is just a place for Roma kids to get away from things - hang out.<eos> Did Cal hang out here?<eos> He did, didn't he?
I mean, who has to hire three C.O.O.s in six months?<eos> I'm starting to look like an idiot.<eos> Ouch. No, no, no, no, that came out wrong.<eos> No, I wasn't referring to you.<eos> I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.<eos> Don't worry. You didn't.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You actually inspired me.<eos> Tomorrow morning, the Gucci comes out of the cold storage, and my assault on Wall Street begins.<eos> Damn right it does.
That pathological creature is going to get what she deserves.<eos> And what about me? Will I?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What did you do? I tried to kill her.<eos> Last night, I went out of my mind, and I started a fire.<eos> But she survived.<eos> And she knows it was me.<eos> And I have never been more afraid.<eos> - You don't know what she's capable of.<eos> - Oh, I do.
Nice doing business with you, homes.<eos> You should come consult for me.<eos> Triple T could always use a little more... authenticity.<eos> You know, I-I might actually just take you up on that.<eos> You know, at least visit the set, check out the minas<eos> - in the bikinis.<eos> - Yeah, right? Can I<eos> - Yeah, yeah, go ahead, go ahead, man.<eos> Wipe your feet before you mess up my carpet, all right?<eos> - Hey, how you doing?
Mr. Queen, I met your father once.<eos> Charity event.<eos> One of the things we spoke of was you.<eos> I think he would be very proud of the man you've become.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And please, call me Oliver.<eos> There is something off about that guy.<eos> Captain Singh approved the task force.<eos> You wanted me to believe The Flash was real.<eos> Now I do.
Overruled.<eos> Yes, Mr. Roja, at one time, worked for Mr. Bishop.<eos> In his... drug empire. Objection... not in evidence.<eos> Sustained.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, when Mr. Roja gave you this money, was Mr. Bishop present?<eos> Yes. He was there?<eos> Mr. Bishop was there?<eos> Yes, but on another matter.<eos> Uh, does the ASA have any more questions?<eos> Yes, I do.
All right.<eos> Well, well.<eos> You bring another police escort?<eos> Just us bad guys.<eos> We had nothing to do with the sheriffs.<eos> Of course, you gunned them down, so now they're everyone's problem.<eos> We hear the bitch lived.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately.<eos> But she is critical and not talking.<eos> And if she does?
Death papers.<eos> Okay.<eos> I loved Tara very much.<eos> Don't.<eos> This is not an excuse.<eos> I'm not defending myself.<eos> I barely remember what happened that night.<eos> But it happened.<eos> Yes.<eos> It did.

Relax.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> Can I have one?<eos> Not even funny.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Your dad just texted.<eos> He said he's okay. He's safe.<eos> Obviously, this is a really fucked-up thing to do, but it's not entirely his fault.<eos> I don't know if Jay told you, but he stopped taking his medication.<eos> No, he didn't.
It's nice.<eos> It hasn't changed.<eos> You still have live music?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> When can I see you again?<eos> - I guess that's up to Adriana.<eos> - Actually, it's up to my husband.<eos> He pays for these visits, and I pay for his out of my account.<eos> Did you guys...
Look, I know Adam's your little superstar, but there's a reason he's always in the chorus.<eos> Well, I can't tell him that.<eos> - It would shatter his precious heart.<eos> - Aw. Lucky for you, I can.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Mom needs to tell you something about the show.<eos> - She thinks it sucks.<eos> - What?<eos> Don't get her wrong, she thinks you're the most talented, delicious boy in the whole world, who deserves to be the star.<eos> But no one else does.
But I have a forgiving heart, Claire, especially for the ones I love.<eos> And I will proudly raise this child as if it was my own.<eos> I'll protect it with my life.<eos> William...<eos> Probably silly to think flowers would cheer you up in a moment like this, but I thought I'd give it a go.<eos> My favorite flowers.<eos> Well, at least they used to be.<eos> Desert sage.<eos> Why did you want to delay Gabriel's execution?<eos> I didn't.

Like butter.<eos> - Your skin's like butter.<eos> - Shea butter.<eos> - Oh, nice.<eos> - Shea butter.<eos> The only thing I hated about taking the hormones was the weight gain, the weight gain, and the weight gain.<eos> Oh, my God, like a tick I blew up.<eos> Girl, that guy is still staring at you. Shea, the guy at the bar.<eos> He's still staring at you.<eos> Oh, God, don't.
What do you want me to do, daddy?<eos> Hike up that skirt.<eos> Let me see those panties.<eos> Pull 'em down to your knees.<eos> Daddy, normally I would object to the use of the word panties.<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> You talk too much.<eos> What the fuck is all that?<eos> Big girls have bush, daddy.<eos> Not all of 'em do.
- Shh! Be quiet!<eos> - Wait... - ♪ You said that you could... ♪<eos> Oh, man, I can't get...<eos> - Who makes these freakin' things? - I don't know.<eos> Are you wet?<eos> - Yeah. - You seem so wet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Totally wet.<eos> You want this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
How you doing? Doctors Rush and Burke, MDs.<eos> Hospital affiliation?<eos> Mount Cypress.<eos> Mount Freelance.<eos> Sarah.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How'd you know I'd be here?<eos> Easy, conceited.<eos> I had no idea you'd be here.<eos> - Alex... - He didn't.
Good to get back the old name now.<eos> - See you at the seminar this weekend, then. - Seminar?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Did not you mail it?<eos> I'm not totally up and running yet, like pure ICT-wise, so...<eos> Welcome you should be.<eos> Did you know that in Iraq, they have 33 words for corruption and not one only for seminar? - No?<eos> You kidding?<eos> - Ok, but then we'll see?<eos> - We do that, Bo.
You did good earlier.<eos> If I failed to mention it.<eos> Well, now I know what line of work you do.<eos> It's not for everyone, luv.<eos> So, after this, you find a nice, quiet new town?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Because I'm that kind of, uh... chica bonita.<eos> We really don't want to be standing here.<eos> Sometimes appeals of faith just need a little time to be answered.<eos> Care to do the honors?
Excuse me.<eos> How many days ago was this poured?<eos> I don't know... a day or two ago?<eos> I lost the signal.<eos> Call that number again, detective.<eos> What is he doing?<eos> Is he kidding me?<eos> - Henry.<eos> - I better get Mr. Delgros.<eos> Yes. You do that.
They meet, fall in love.<eos> - But...?<eos> - But he's already married.<eos> - And...? - And so she...<eos> - Well, I've read it before.<eos> - Right. So how is it different?<eos> He kills her.<eos> In the end.<eos> Okay. Now I'm interested.<eos> How does he do it?
I was lighting candles day and night.<eos> - Like that?<eos> - No, not like that.<eos> That's check, or I could take your queen like that.<eos> Alex Jamison was gay.<eos> Everybody knew it except you.<eos> No, I knew it, I just didn't think it was a deal breaker.<eos> Anyway, the day of the wedding, I broke out in hives.<eos> - That's so not true.<eos> - I did.
- It was okay.<eos> - You get good stuff?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Mom, you're missing the best part.<eos> I can't wait to see the look on the bastard's face.<eos> What'd I do?<eos> If I were you, I'd be talking to Oscar Hodges.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Tell me why. Did you know during prohibition, Montauk was a major center for moonshine production?<eos> No, I didn't.
That's good.<eos> That's good.<eos> Alison, I am gonna keep saying this... Until you hear it.<eos> It wasn't your fault.<eos> This is why secondary drowning is so dangerous, especially in young children, because it just looks like they're tired, just like any kid who spent the day at the beach.<eos> There's no way you could've known.<eos> But if I had taken him to the hospital right away... If I hadn't let him sleep... Would he be alive now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you believe in heaven, dr. Henry?<eos> No, I don't.
Wait...<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, you can't do this.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa.<eos> Stop!<eos> I can't swim!<eos> No! No!<eos> Please.<eos> Please don't do this.
Aand she seemed pretty upset about it, so...<eos> You know she adores you, right?<eos> Isn't she, like, your closest friend?<eos> I don't want to talk about Divya.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, that's personal.<eos> I get it.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, if you want to talk...<eos> I do.
And where is he now?<eos> We're working on that.<eos> He got away from us earlier tonight.<eos> But not before I hit him with an arrow Laced with particulate nanotechnology.<eos> Felicity wrote a program that tracks the nanites using gps.<eos> The tracer arrow. Yeah.<eos> You had a shot at merlyn and you didn't kill him?<eos> I tagged him. With a flesh wound!<eos> There's nowhere in the world he can go where I can't find him.<eos> And when you do?
I apologize for barging in like this, but we have news from one of our scouts.<eos> Have you found Anna?<eos> No, but they discovered something else in their search.<eos> What does it say?<eos> There's an army massing in the southern mountains, heading for Arendelle.<eos> Led by Prince Hans.<eos> (SIGHS) Well, I know every inch of those mountains.<eos> Let me sneak up there and see what he's up to.<eos> I didn't realize the official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer got a say in matters.<eos> He doesn't.
Evolutionary leaps follow the creation of new technologies.<eos> It's that simple.<eos> Like the Roomba.<eos> Yes, like the Roomba.<eos> So humor me here.<eos> Hmm? If we know that meta-humans were created by the particle accelerator and testimony shows that a meta-human may have been involved in the murder of Barry Allen's mother 14 years ago, it seems to me that... Way back then there must have been another particle accelerator.<eos> - Another particle accelerator?<eos> I can assure you that's extremely unlikely, detective, and if they were I don't recall any dark matter lightning storms before I moved to town.<eos> Do you?<eos> No, no, I don't.
Terry, you are the best!<eos> World, your angel has returned.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Thanks for the ride.<eos> Tag me in those pics.<eos> Ah, hi there.<eos> I'm Jake Peralta, NYPD.<eos> You guys towed my car, and I really need it back. Mm-hmm.<eos> Got a badge?<eos> Yeah, I sure do.
Delivery came for you from your protégé.<eos> Fara?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like garbage bags filled with trash.<eos> Leave it in my office.<eos> I'll deal with it later.<eos> So what do you think?<eos> About what exactly?<eos> You heard me talking to him.<eos> Everyone did.
I took six months of karate lessons.<eos> Well, now you can take six months of acting lessons.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why would you buy a lie detector?<eos> I didn't, they gave it to me at the Spy Shop because I am a valued customer.<eos> I mean, this will either work or give her a massive shock. What?<eos> ! Okay, nothing.<eos> Let's just start out with an easy question, shall we?<eos> All right. Do you believe that bigfoot exists?<eos> Duh, yes I do.
'When you're young and time takes an age, 'it feels like nothing will ever change.<eos> 'But it does.
Unless we figure out a way around 10b-6, like I told Jessica I would.<eos> You told her that?<eos> Harvey, no one has ever been able to do that.<eos> Listen to me. You want to make a splash?<eos> Part the Red Sea.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> "Oh, no" what?<eos> You have that look on your face like you want me to have some emotional conversation I don't feel like having.<eos> You know what, Harvey? I just came in here to see if you needed anything.<eos> I don't.
- Two.<eos> - Four.<eos> - Three.<eos> That was my plan all along.<eos> That's Suzanne.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> - That's foul. - Yeah.<eos> - That's not our problem anymore.<eos> - I don't know what is... - What did you feed him? - So it's...<eos> I don't...
She's poised, smart, she pulls off those chic hats.<eos> She could be exactly what you need to appeal to that stupid transplant board.<eos> You have got to be kidding me.<eos> 48 hours into labor, I knew that kid was gonna be a problem.<eos> The only thing harder than breaking out of a hospital... breaking back in.<eos> - Hello, Dash.<eos> - Hey, Brittany.<eos> Mm, don't even try to sweet-talk me.<eos> Nurse Jackson is looking for Leo, and I know you know where he is.<eos> I do.
Oh, sorry.<eos> Sorry, sorry, sorry.<eos> And... - there we go. - Oh.<eos> Worm-free.<eos> It's terrible to have those little monsters inside you.<eos> You don't want them to come out because they hurt so much, but... they have to come out.<eos> If they stay inside, they kill you.<eos> You don't know what I mean, do you?<eos> What?<eos> I-I do, actually.
Have you ever heard of acoustic cryptoanalysis?<eos> The analysis of the sound produced during encryption processing...<eos> We know what it is.<eos> Yeah, well, I run that puppy, chances are it can reverse-code even the most secure site.<eos> Not even the FBI has that capability.<eos> Yeah, well, I do.<eos> You're bluffing.<eos> Let him try it.<eos> He has no clearance.<eos> He does now.
No?<eos> How long has this been going on?<eos> Here we are, Station House.<eos> It seems the man isn't here yet.<eos> I must have some shade.<eos> Yes, of course, of course.<eos> Certainly.<eos> This one's a handsome fella.<eos> He's got a bowed tendon.<eos> Ah... well, so he does.
Well, he and Franny seem to have hit it off.<eos> Can I borrow him for a minute?<eos> Course.<eos> What'd you find out?<eos> Crocker swears up and down there was no engagement with Islamabad of any kind.<eos> What about an overture to Haqqani?<eos> He calls that "unthinkable."<eos> "Political suicide."<eos> How does he explain Dar Adal on the ground, then?<eos> - He doesn't.
This is a labor of love for everyone involved.<eos> Okay, does that about do it?<eos> You know, I'd like to try one more, if that's okay.<eos> Um, this time really hit the words "special" and "dear."<eos> You know, special project for my dear friend.<eos> Ok, maybe this time you can just riff a little bit about how I inspire you as a performer and a human being.<eos> Okay, you have got all of my scripted dialogue plus about ten takes of that making-of bullshit, you fuzzy little prick, and that is all you get.<eos> Ooh, I can feel the vibrations from your throaty timbre deep within my loins.<eos> [DEEP VOICE] I bet the ladies love it.<eos> Your mother did.
And if you don't do what I'm asking, I'll just have to find the one in 100 that's in a position to turn on you.<eos> I'll take my chances, Harvey.<eos> Now, get out of my face. Let me finish my cigar in peace.<eos> See the money, wanna stay for your meal Get another piece of pie for your wife<eos> Everybody wanna know how it feel Everybody wanna see what it's like<eos> I'll even eat a bean pie I don't mind Me and missy is so early<eos> All step back I'm 'bout to dance<eos> The greenback boogie<eos> You know?<eos> Of course I do.
And you're the closest person she has.<eos> Sure, Louis.<eos> I'll talk to Jessica for you.<eos> Hey. You're off the hook with Cahill.<eos> He's gonna start with me and Harvey in the morning.<eos> Am I?<eos> Are you what?<eos> Off the hook.<eos> Rachel... I didn't mean for what happened to happen.<eos> But it did.
Love you.<eos> So do you think you can help me out before I get a reputation as a diva?<eos> Dude, relax. I know I already have one.<eos> Otherwise, I'd still be doing chanel, not chewy's.<eos> But I'm never gonna get back there unless you help me out. So just tell me what you need from me.<eos> - Blood and urine.<eos> This one's for you.<eos> - Evan, have a seat.<eos> - Listen, we need to talk.<eos> - No, we don't.
Come on.<eos> Haskell, this is serious.<eos> No one leaves until we get the all clear.<eos> In the meantime, I'll be coming through shortly with a selection of beverages.<eos> Here's your coffee, Holly, with two sugars because you are so sweet.<eos> Why are you so happy today?<eos> My English Lit professor just posted the grade for my paper.<eos> And what did we get?<eos> Although I have a feeling it begins with an A.<eos> It does, a...
[Moaning]<eos> No, stop, stop.<eos> Oh, stop.<eos> Who owns this place?<eos> Grateful dead?<eos> We grew up together.<eos> She's a folk musician and she tours with different bands all over the world.<eos> Did you ever think about leaving?<eos> When I was younger I wanted to be a doctor.<eos> You did?
You're giving that to Ali?<eos> I'm giving it to both of you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I should give you all my old wedding rings, too.<eos> - One couldn't possibly be enough. - Athena.<eos> Let us remind you how shackled to this family you really are,<eos> - Athena, don't.<eos> How many wedding rings do you have?<eos> I didn't get the monogamy gene, darling.<eos> Not everyone does.
I'm taking Whitney over to Jody's.<eos> This it?<eos> - Whit? - Yes.<eos> You're not even sorry about this.<eos> I am.<eos> It's horrible what she did.<eos> What you did.<eos> Okay, I know it seems like whatever, but A, I didn't set up that account.<eos> You tell the people at Twitter that.<eos> Okay, Ruby did it.
Uh, sort of.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I've been thinking. I can understand why you don't want to be like me anymore, but I'm not sure I should stay here if I'm the only Grimm.<eos> - Listen, Trubel... - if I stick around,<eos> I'll only be putting you in danger.<eos> You and Juliette are safer without me.<eos> You can't have a normal life if I'm here.<eos> You don't have to leave until...<eos> Oh, hey, Nick.<eos> How you doing?
Before I could stop her, she ran outside, got in her car.<eos> Where were you before that?<eos> Asleep in bed.<eos> I ran downstairs as soon as I heard her, but I couldn't get to her in time. This is... My fault.<eos> Was your wife drinking last night?<eos> She's not supposed to.<eos> She's on heavy medication.<eos> We're gonna need to take a look around your house.<eos> I don't want to leave Ava alone unless you need me to come with you.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I can come back.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No. It's fine.<eos> Of course.<eos> Please.<eos> All right, everything looks great.<eos> So, unless you start having other health concerns, I'd say you're in good shape.<eos> Did you see your father this morning?<eos> I did.
I'm sure they do.<eos> I'm not saying they don't do as good a job.<eos> What I'm saying is they don't deserve to earn as much money as men.<eos> Right?<eos> Men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and Jim Jefferies tickets and all that shit!<eos> Now...<eos> I'm sure there's women in this room that are saying,<eos> "Oh, I pay for my drinks. I bought my own ticket."<eos> And don't think we don't appreciate the uglies, 'cause we do.<eos> Right? We do.
Your world has to be bigger than just you and me, Booth.<eos> It is, all right?<eos> I'm back to work, aren't I?<eos> Well, objectively that's true.<eos> But you still don't seem to trust anyone.<eos> And you have to, to do this job.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Then listen to me.<eos> Sweets said that you have to believe in something again, something bigger than yourself.<eos> I do.
That's how I saw it for most of my life, but I think that's because I was around bad ones.<eos> I'm less cynical nowadays.<eos> Any particular reason?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Another thing I know about you is that you hate being put on the spot.<eos> So, I'm sorry.<eos> How about we go to -- there's a cof--<eos> Oh, I hope it's okay.<eos> I, uh, texted Stephie that we'd be here.<eos> I did the same thing with Stu. What?
Come on.<eos> Sorry about the rope.<eos> _<eos> At least we know he can talk.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> I knew it. He doesn't understand a word we're saying.<eos> It's a tactic.<eos> If we think he doesn't speak English, we won't expect him to tell us anything.<eos> Due respect sir, then why do we expect him to lead us to his commander and not into a trap?<eos> We don't.
You're working from home again, seriously?<eos> People work from home.<eos> Robert, we're politicians.<eos> We don't work from home.<eos> Every day we suck it up, we go into the office, and we meet with lobbyists.<eos> It's what we do.<eos> And we don't lie around for weeks moaning about how screwed up our personal life is.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we don't have one.<eos> - I did.
Wow.<eos> Senator Laffer, you have 30 seconds to respond.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Okay, our next question comes from Shelby Mellman of KPVK, Reno news live.<eos> Senator Laffer, you have said that as a rich, successful entertainer, that Mr. Jillette would be out of touch with the concerns of everyday Americans. Do you think that's fair?<eos> Fair?<eos> Well, Shelby, let's put it to the test, shall we?<eos> I would ask my opponent if he knows how much this half-gallon of milk costs.<eos> Have any idea, Jillette?<eos> Because I do.
- Lovely.<eos> - Are you a friend of Will's, are you?<eos> Oh, no, I'm meeting a friend there, yeah.<eos> I mean, I know Halloween's a silly, made up American holiday.<eos> - I know!<eos> - Well, I have to say I have rather fallen hook, line, and sinker for it.<eos> Me too.<eos> - Great. - Yeah.<eos> Arabian princess, I presume?<eos> Well done, detective.
Come in!<eos> Please sit down.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> You've got the job!<eos> Heard you ballsed up your workshop, Churchy.<eos> No. I should have got that job.<eos> Poor Sarah. Pours her heart and soul into this careers... thingy, then you come along and take a giant dump on it.<eos> If anyone's going to take a giant... deposit on today, it's you and your CV workshop.<eos> I bet you don't even know what CV stands for.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You're improving. Okay, Labeaux made half a dozen calls to one number in the 48 hours before the original painting disappeared.<eos> The name is encrypted, but I think I can break it.<eos> In how long?<eos> That long.<eos> And I thought I didn't like him 'cause he was a know-it-all art jerk.<eos> Here's an e-mail from Labeaux to Paulson with his bank's routing and account numbers.<eos> Labeaux provides access to the fake,<eos> Paulson provides access to the original.<eos> We didn't find the painting at Labeaux's because he never had it.<eos> Paulson does.
Don't worry. Coulson has a plan.<eos> You would sacrifice one of your own agents.<eos> We all take risks in this business.<eos> In your case, it just didn't pay off.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> Tiny violin's playing, But no one's listening, sweetheart.<eos> Who's making you do this?<eos> Hydra.<eos> They want the obelisk, but you don't have it.<eos> Skye's father does.
And they died like this?<eos> What is it?<eos> I know how to stop the attack.<eos> He's stable for now.<eos> We should go.<eos> You ready?<eos> Even if you can save lincoln... He won't be the same.<eos> The things he's done... They'll stay with him.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
Abby. You can't serious--<eos> They're here.<eos> Initiated evacuation plan 2a.<eos> Report to your station supervisor for further instructions.<eos> They're not attacking yet, Which means we still have time.<eos> We have two hours till dawn.<eos> Let me talk to the commander. She was anya's second.<eos> Maybe she'll listen.<eos> We don't even know if the commander's here.<eos> Yes, we do.
Come look.<eos> This town needs their preacher.<eos> I'm nobody's preacher anymore.<eos> The hammering stopped.<eos> They finished.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's almost dawn.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Of course I do.
No-one understands what that's like.<eos> There are a hundred who see through me, standing at their government depots, shouting what to think.<eos> Not any more.<eos> - You too.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> - It's a state change.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> It's just a transition and soon, they won't be there and well be free.<eos> Please... I don't want it.<eos> You do.

Well, good luck on your rocket ship to the top without me.<eos> No, BoJack, the show's about a horse, and I told those suits if they want my show, then that horse is gonna be BJ Goddamn Horseman. - Oh, my God.<eos> - And they said, "No."<eos> - Oh.<eos> - And I said, "Please?"<eos> And they said, "Okay."<eos> So, what do you say?<eos> - Want to be my star?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> Of course I do.
Yes, today, it's short and knobby, but tomorrow?<eos> Well, sure, Diane is short, but I don't know about knobby.<eos> The last thing I want to do is hurt Diane, but I keep having this dream where she's gone.<eos> There's no break-up, no tragedy.<eos> She's just gone, and my life continues without her.<eos> And it terrifies me to say this, but in the dream I feel... relief.<eos> Hey, thanks for listening to all this.<eos> You're a really good friend, Todd.<eos> Since you weren't able to give me any useful intel, I had to offer up my restaurant, but now, we're on my turf.<eos> Time for operation "I don't."
Thank you for coming, dear.<eos> I love that you can do that.<eos> Just, eyes in the back of your head.<eos> Or your reflection in the back of my camera.<eos> Thunderstorm?<eos> Probably what?<eos> Mature stage multicell cluster.<eos> It's just rain.<eos> I like rain.<eos> Who doesn't?
We know Harold was in on it, 'cause he's the one who bought the ink.<eos> And we know he didn't kill himself.<eos> Stuffed in a closet pretty much confirms that.<eos> What's he got going on in his mouth?<eos> Full set. 32 and counting.<eos> So, Harold gets done in his own trailer.<eos> Not likely he was snuck up on in there.<eos> The toothless accomplice.<eos> Where we gonna find him?<eos> Same place Calvin did.
Honey, tell her the truth.<eos> I'm your father.<eos> And you're coming home with me. Your mother's worried sick.<eos> EMMA:<eos> You have a family?<eos> I thought you were like me.<eos> - You lied to me. - (WIND HOWLING)<eos> You said you didn't have a clue where Sidney was.<eos> He was in your mirror the whole time?<eos> Maybe I did. So what?
Irritating me?<eos> Yes, you have.<eos> No, when I was a kid.<eos> Someone came into my life for a while, and I thought we were going to be best friends.<eos> But this girl lied to me, and I pushed her away because of that lie, and she asked me to forgive her, but I never did.<eos> It took some time, but I realized that was a mistake. And I regretted the decision, but by then, it was too late. The damage was already done.<eos> I don't wanna make the same mistake again, Regina.<eos> Living in Storybrooke, I've got my son and my parents, and I love them. But they can't always understand me.<eos> They don't know what it feels like to be rejected and misunderstood.<eos> Not the way I do. Not the way you do.
More like "schlock flop-era." Ugh!<eos> ♪ In space ♪ Rock opera?<eos> ♪ Loam ♪<eos> - Enough!<eos> - Clearly, Van Cleef has shown a rare lapse in taste and judgment.<eos> I apologize for wasting your time with this talentless imp.<eos> Hey, Van Cleef, Todd may not be ready for the high-flying world of rock opera or the larger world outside of my living room couch, but you know what?<eos> He's a good friend.<eos> I don't see how that's relevant.<eos> No, of course you don't.
Doesn't he realize the doors that would open? It's like resume gold.<eos> I would finally have a track record outside of hankmed.<eos> - You should explain that to Hank.<eos> You should explain all of that to Hank and tell him how you feel. - I feel fine.<eos> It's--he's just not interested, you know?<eos> I'm at peace with it.<eos> - Seems like an angry peace.<eos> Look, with everything that's going on,<eos> Hank, Emma, the board, if you want to keep talking to Bob- what?<eos> No, I don't.

- Well, Evan found him... Online.<eos> - Did he ever say he was a doctor?<eos> - No.<eos> In fact, he insisted we call him Bob, but I just figured he was trying to make us comfortable.<eos> - If it makes you feel any better, he does have an undergraduate degree from concordia university. - Yeah?<eos> A degree in what?<eos> - Theater.<eos> - I'm sorry if you feel deceived.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I don't.
Oh, right, yeah, the pic...<eos> No, I forgot about that.<eos> That is why you are both here.<eos> Well, Churcherella, get yourself down to Wickes.<eos> No rush. Have a little browse, grab a coffee, come back in a couple of hours.<eos> No, you should go.<eos> I need to stay here and guard Sarah.<eos> No, you go. Right, you can both go.<eos> Cock blocker.<eos> What you doing under there, babes?
No, you are. Well, tell your tongue that.<eos> Look, I wanna say... it to you.<eos> - Then why can't you?<eos> - Because I'm not a good person.<eos> I've done things, things that... made me think that I can't be your Prince Charming.<eos> - If you only knew, you'd...<eos> - I'd what?<eos> Punish you? Look, I've done tons of stupid I'm not proud of either.<eos> But if you really want to make this work...<eos> Oh, of course I do.
Out of here.<eos> I've come to return your watch, sir.<eos> My Uncle's marrying and cannot accommodate your leaving camp as you wish.<eos> He is gone out.<eos> To bury his man.<eos> He will be back tomorrow.<eos> It is Jared's spirit brought this on.<eos> I am of the belief that it was you caused his death.<eos> He saw your congress with your father-in-law.<eos> As did I.
Ma!<eos> What is it?<eos> Bad.<eos> You have to come.<eos> Buck up, boy.<eos> Quit your mewling.<eos> He's going to fall.<eos> My baby!<eos> Shh, shh, shh, shh. Don't much like drinking alone.<eos> Nobody does, Captain.
Instead, he sends me gareth Henderson gear.<eos> Well, great.<eos> I'm glad you got that off your chest.<eos> Look!<eos> Lena Dunham's dog got a haircut.<eos> I mean, does he think that after, what, 30-odd years on this planet, I'm magically going to start sharing his<eos> - interests in... - Uh, still waiting for our friends.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - No one ever asks me that!<eos> But since you did,
- You can write on the... - I'm sorry, I got to stay.<eos> Ma'am, the White House called.<eos> You've been summoned to Camp David.<eos> Motorcade's waiting outside.<eos> Oh, fine.<eos> The leader of the free world trumps lunch?<eos> Sorry. (laughs)<eos> It's okay.<eos> I see what you did there.<eos> I did.
What exactly am I apologizing for?<eos> "For visiting the plant without investigating the scope and disparity of U.S. and Indian industrial standards."<eos> "Had I done so, I would have urged<eos> "both countries to raise their standards for the sake of all their citizens."<eos> - Bingo.<eos> - Sure.<eos> But Hepanza still gets to hide behind MIP standards.<eos> Aren't I just pulling India's pants down?<eos> They might not care if they can play your mea culpa - ad nauseam.<eos> - And if they do?
Oh, yeah.<eos> The Creel business.<eos> In fact, perhaps they need our assistance.<eos> If they're looking for a way to neutralize Creel's ability...<eos> No one has our experience with gifteds.<eos> Of course, we can't just hijack the project from them.<eos> - That would shatter their confidence.<eos> - Yeah, no. - Do not want to do that.<eos> - No.<eos> - Or do we?
Only because I happened to be at the academy giving a le... a lecture.<eos> - You seem nervous.<eos> - Because I am.<eos> I was escorted here by armed guards.<eos> I'm well aware of who I work for.<eos> Let's discuss your previous employer.<eos> Why did you join S.H.I.E.L.D. in the first place?<eos> I was a 17-year-old girl with two Phds and a million questions.<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D. had the resources to help me answer them.<eos> - Now they don't, and Hydra does.
We just need a plan. You don't understand!<eos> These people are worse than Zs!<eos> They'll kill all of you!<eos> Yeah, she's right. We need to look at the big picture.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Do you know where they've taken her?<eos> I know you think we're monsters.<eos> In human.<eos> We all did too at first.
John?<eos> Say something, please.<eos> Wasn't your fault, mate.<eos> Should've never gotten you all involved.<eos> You, especially.<eos> Because I'm a coward.<eos> Because it's not your world.<eos> Never was and I knew it.<eos> And I knew you were high.<eos> We all did.
So, we are just about cleared out, and I'm officially releasing the rooms.<eos> Good.<eos> We got two new patients coming in. Wow.<eos> You don't waste any time, do you?<eos> We can't afford to.<eos> A lot of people need help.<eos> You know, I-I was really harsh the other day when I talked to you about Daycia, and I shouldn't have been.<eos> She didn't understand her addiction.<eos> Didn't realize that she was battling a disease.<eos> Most people don't.
Can I help you, babes?<eos> I'm Ryan's mum, got his kit.<eos> Ryan, what you doing with that cone on your head?<eos> Go on, get changed.<eos> Thanks, Mum.<eos> It's been a while, Trevor.<eos> Since what?<eos> Since we, um... you know.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Did we?
- Who's coming over?<eos> (exhales) Sarah.<eos> - Sarah? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - "Love of your life" Sarah?<eos> - Yeah. Now it's all making sense. Well, no, it's not, actually, because she is dating someone else.<eos> So what's the occasion?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Which is why I'm meeting my chief romantic advisor right now in the bar.<eos> Oh, I wish I had a romantic advisor.<eos> You do.
Hello? I'm a brother.<eos> I know who Boss Nova is.<eos> Great.<eos> Uh, can you tell him I'm busy.<eos> - He's a client of yours?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How come you never told me that?<eos> Patient confidentiality.<eos> Did he say what the problem was?<eos> No, but he never does.
What's the problem today?<eos> No problem.<eos> Just trying to get some work done.<eos> You don't know this, but a big part of my job is listening.<eos> You know, people like to tell you all kinds of crazy shit when they buy drugs; it makes them feel like it isn't just a purchase.<eos> Thank you, but... no thank you.<eos> You sure?<eos> I've got prime listening skills.<eos> You don't want to hear this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Robbins is Karev's mentor.<eos> Torres is married to Robbins. So whoo!<eos> Team Karev. Jackson Avery... friend of Alex Karev.<eos> We used to double-date.<eos> Speaking of which, Avery has a history of making wrong choices.<eos> Hey, Dr. Herman. Sorry I don't have that case report in to you yet.<eos> I've got this neuroblastoma on this baby, and the mom got really overreactive, and so I-I had to reassure her.<eos> Dr. Robbins, in fetal surgery, every patient you treat will come encased in a mother... a mother whose heightened state of concern is a biological and evolutionary necessity.<eos> If you lack the basic skills to...<eos> No, I don't. I don't.
Kindest person I've ever known.<eos> My sister wasn't born a killer.<eos> Malcolm Merlyn made her one, and I let it happen.<eos> No, you didn't. When it comes to your family, you always place the blame on yourself, but this is not your fault.<eos> She's right, Oliver.<eos> Throw Malcolm in front of Ra's, let the League sort this out.<eos> He made contingencies.<eos> Oliver, if you fight Ra's al Ghul, he'll kill you.<eos> No, he won't. During the Undertaking, Merlyn told me that I couldn't win, because I didn't know what I was fighting for.<eos> Now I do.
Look, we're both trying to find out who the hell's doing this.<eos> We could help each other.<eos> His name is Albert Mancini.<eos> No criminal record, aside from a few unpaid parking tickets.<eos> Grant says he doesn't know who this guy is.<eos> Oh, and now you believe him?<eos> I haven't decided yet!<eos> Do you know that you're training with a vigilante?<eos> Former, apparently.<eos> And no, I didn't.
Free to go.<eos> Emma.<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> Next year I promise it's just you and me, kiddo, okay?<eos> I can't believe I traded my shoes for soap.<eos> I can't believe I sent you those pictures.<eos> Yeah, neither can I.<eos> You know, Riley, I didn't think you had it in you.<eos> But you didn't win.<eos> Sure I did!
Sure.<eos> About what?<eos> Muggings on the National Mall.<eos> Doubt I can help you.<eos> I got to get back to practice.<eos> Yeah, well... practice is gonna have to wait.<eos> Why do you want to talk to me?<eos> We've got a photograph of you fleeing a mugging near the Vietnam Memorial last Friday, wearing this backpack.<eos> You mind if we search it?<eos> Yeah... yeah, I do.
It didn't sound that serious.<eos> When she didn't come in this morning or call, I phoned, but got no answer.<eos> It's strange because Courtney 's a very conscientious employee.<eos> It's not like her to be irresponsible.<eos> How long has she worked for you, Mr. Tolson?<eos> About six years.<eos> She joined us just after she got out of the Navy.<eos> Courtney's a systems analyst.<eos> With her military background, our clients love her.<eos> You do a lot of government work.
I couldn't agree more.<eos> Now, wait a minute.<eos> You sure these were taken of him?<eos> Yes.<eos> I took 'em myself.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Oh...<eos> This gentleman has both his original central incisors.<eos> Is that a problem?<eos> Angus didn't.
I didn't say that it did.<eos> But we have to look at you just like we would any other person of interest.<eos> This is unbelievable.<eos> This is the third time I've been a murder suspect.<eos> That makes me want to kill someone so you don't waste your time.<eos> It was a joke.<eos> I was joking.<eos> Do you want to see the evidence I found or what?<eos> Sure do.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Right now, he's looking pretty credible.<eos> You know...<eos> I hired another consultant.<eos> An attorney.<eos> And I'd like to call her right now, if you don't mind.<eos> Any word from Wendell?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Do you think we can call the doctors who are administering the trial?<eos> Maybe something happened to him.<eos> I did.
No, dad, I'm searing them.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay, Max.<eos> Easy. Hi, grandpa.<eos> I got 'em.<eos> I got 'em.<eos> Let go.<eos> - How are you? - I'm good. I like a girl.<eos> Really?<eos> - Yeah. - You do like a girl?
- No, no.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Oh. Just a little out of practice, I think.<eos> I hope my voice can fill the lounge.<eos> Well, you have your band.<eos> That's what they're for.<eos> I... don't actually have a band.<eos> I've mostly sung with backing tracks.<eos> Do you think I need one?<eos> Yes, yes, you do.
You have to understand, when Jane looks at you, she just keeps remembering this sequence of events in her head... the pregnancy, the lying.<eos> How do I get that out of her head?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe with time?<eos> Is she still wearing her ring?<eos> Seriously, did you punch yourself?<eos> Rafael, stop.<eos> You and I both know what happened.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
Well, there's nothing we can do about the past, so let's just move forward.<eos> Report back to work Monday.<eos> And so Jane the virgin left with her job intact and her heart full of forgiveness.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I didn't think you'd let her stay.<eos> But I'm glad you did.<eos> She really seems like a good girl.<eos> She does, doesn't she?
This...<eos> Venomous serpent,<eos> I hold, glory to god, Death in my hands!<eos> This serpent...<eos> It cannot conquer me. Sir.<eos> No way. And his plan is perfect.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Somebody call for help!<eos> Zach, you stay with me, okay?<eos> Don't you...
Find out what time it was recorded.<eos> We got Barry Keane's shoes.<eos> - You were right - size-9 Reeboks.<eos> - Watch and learn, folks.<eos> Which puts Barry in pole position.<eos> Arrest him.<eos> I don't want him going anywhere tonight.<eos> Adam Hutchings is a bit of a mess, but he's agreed to answer some questions in the interview room.<eos> Me and Tim had wanted to get straight out.<eos> Rich didn't.
I found a vent.<eos> I saw light... daylight.<eos> And I just kept crawling forward, toward the light.<eos> I didn't care where it led-- Heaven, hell...<eos> I didn't care, I just kept going.<eos> I just kept going...<eos> I...<eos> I can't remember much more than that.<eos> No, that's good.<eos> You're-you're doing really good.
- Previously on ascension...<eos> - Your father was convinced that the us could launch an interstellar spacecraft<eos> Right then in the '60s, with the technology we had.<eos> - Quite a dream dad had.<eos> - Lorelei!<eos> - We lost one of our own in a tragic accident, lorelei wright.<eos> - I don't have experience with anything like this.<eos> - Nobody does.
I got money.<eos> I reckon this'll buy me 15%.<eos> But you say what's right.<eos> Assuming it's money I need to partner with ya.<eos> Peek-a-boo, hot dang... There you go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you want, carrot snapper?<eos> That's it.<eos> You find the good stuff, Harry?<eos> He did.
- You were the only on at the residence at the time the documents were downloaded.<eos> We synced up the compute with your keycard logs.<eos> You want to register your protest now, Dennis?<eos> Demand a lawyer, wave the Constitution in my face, threaten me with the wrath of your almighty wife?<eos> Or do we just assume all that crap, and get on with it?<eos> I'm an American citizen, technically on American soil.<eos> You are a traitor, and I am the fucking CIA.<eos> You're not going anywhere until you tell me who Sandy's contact was at the ISI.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.
Oh, good. We have a new number.<eos> I'm sending you the details now.<eos> I hope it's better than this one.<eos> My hero.<eos> And are personal calls allowed?<eos> No, they are not.<eos> Are there lots of temps who want this job if you don't?<eos> Why, yes, there are.<eos> Do I understand?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Are they in trouble?<eos> - No.<eos> - I'm not, am I?<eos> - Not at all, no.<eos> - I don't like being in trouble.<eos> - No.<eos> Well... well... well,<eos> Mike and Dez live in the caravan.<eos> We live in the shed.<eos> Mike did.
H-has he been charged with anything?<eos> Because you turned our home upside down.<eos> I'd like to know exactly what you found.<eos> Mr. Bentley, this case is ongoing.<eos> But we can tell this... we found a pair of shoes in your garage that match the footprints from one of our crime scenes.<eos> Okay, well, this is ridiculous.<eos> We're gonna leave.<eos> We'll be back with a lawyer to get our son released.<eos> You all have no real evidence to charge him.<eos> Actually, we do.
Do you want to go through life that way?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't.<eos> Oh, hey, yeah.<eos> I'll take the, um... the rock shrimp meatballs.<eos> What is this place?<eos> I think my life is going nowhere.<eos> Oh. Mmm. No, Cece.<eos> Do you like to learn?<eos> I do.
This guy's story is probably just something to distract us from what he's really here to do.<eos> Yeah, or it's real and he's telling the truth.<eos> We gotta dig into this.<eos> We gotta dig into this. Let's see if Detroit can corroborate.<eos> Lieutenant Kelly.<eos> I've been thinking about your friend's situation.<eos> And?<eos> Maybe we can do a little quid pro quo.<eos> That is, if my welfare means anything to you.<eos> It doesn't.
Three days behind bars... that doesn't give you much material.<eos> No gang rape?<eos> No.<eos> Strangely enough, not.<eos> Well, that's too bad.<eos> 'Cause that would've been a turn-on.<eos> Is that baby lotion?<eos> It's not enough to show that the codes are similar.<eos> To prove economic espionage, they need to show that you knew the Chinese company was going to give it to the government.<eos> - Good. Because I didn't.
Everybody there talks about God.<eos> Like he's some Uncle hiding in the attic.<eos> Drives you crazy.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> Yeah, but even I don't like talking about it.<eos> I don't like pretending to be someone I'm not when I'm being interviewed. Really?<eos> You're good at it.<eos> Your Honor, it was one quarter of a mile outside of Illinois.<eos> It doesn't matter if it was one mile or a hundred miles.<eos> Yes, it does.
So, have you worked for Mr. Agos on any of the Lemond Bishop cases?<eos> Yes, for Alicia Florrick and Diane Lockhart.<eos> So, I'm assuming that, uh... You have regular interaction with, uh, Mr. Bishop?<eos> Had.<eos> He's no longer a client.<eos> Uh... Well, what about Mr. Bishop's employees?<eos> Might you interact with them?<eos> Of his legitimate businesses, yes.<eos> You have an opinion... On whether Mr. Agos is fit for further bail release?<eos> I do.
I'll see what I can do.<eos> You're doing that thing again.<eos> What thing?<eos> Oh, the thing where you're a bitch because you like somebody.<eos> It's pretty transparent.<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> Hey, cutebrag.<eos> Did you just call me cutebrag?<eos> Hey. I didn't come up with it.<eos> Another one of the volunteers did.
Mm-hmm. Rule two--don't really reference Damon at all, or you'll kill me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Rule 3-- wear sunscreen-- don't make fun of me.<eos> It's important that we let Elena live her new happy, problem-ignoring zombie life the way she wants.<eos> A sentence which sounded oddly supportive and judgmental.<eos> I support her.<eos> She did what she needed to do to stop chomping on innocent people on the road, but it doesn't mean that I'm enjoying marinating all alone in my misery.<eos> Well, I'll marinate with you.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> Really, I do.
There were guards then. A midwife.<eos> Lots of people.<eos> But they fled when Hades began to lose his power.<eos> I won't stop 'til he's as powerless as she was.<eos> Oh, Mom.<eos> She meant to have you two leave this place together.<eos> But when the time came, she realized only one could escape.<eos> So she let you go.<eos> She loved me.<eos> My mother did, too.
That's the thing with the Fae.<eos> It's never over.<eos> OK!<eos> We've got chardonnay, licorice, Tremors... your second fave Bacon flick, and Footloose, your number one favorite... well, everyone's number one favourite...<eos> Bo, I can't.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I can't keep being the lost human in the Fae world trying to be Fae.<eos> I'm not Fae.<eos> That has never mattered to me.<eos> But it does to me.
Olivia pope had Harrison plant this.<eos> He paid a girl to say I beat her.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I never...<eos> - David.<eos> I thought you said Harrison Wright buried this.<eos> I thought he did.<eos> I don't know how anyone found it.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Someone did.
You want it?<eos> Oh, I'm sure it's great.<eos> Just distribute it.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> [Scoffs] I ca...<eos> I can't believe it... my 50-year plan shattered by sports.<eos> What's the obsession?<eos> I mean, it... it... it isn't like theater... it doesn't have any real meaning.<eos> Of course it does.
~ Go back to the car!<eos> Go.<eos> Go!<eos> ~ Please, no!<eos> ~ Shut up.<eos> ~ Please, please!<eos> ~ Wait, wait, wait there.<eos> Please!<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> Please, yeah, don't!
Are you still the driver for a criminal?<eos> ~ Yes, I am. ~ Get out of my house.<eos> ~ Let me explain. ~ Get out of my house!<eos> It's my house, too!<eos> How is he?<eos> ~ He's in bed. He won't get out.<eos> ~ Can I go and see him?<eos> Col?<eos> Hi.<eos> How you doing?
Under the floodlights, That blue's gonna make you look like an albino child hooker.<eos> - Bruce!<eos> - What?<eos> You guys are taking this dress More seriously than nana's breast cancer scare.<eos> We all know that you hate pageants.<eos> But remember, they're the reason I'm a meteorologist today.<eos> Oh, they taught you how to smile vacuously for the camera?<eos> They paid for my education.<eos> I've always dreamed of having a daughter I could share the pageant experience with.<eos> And now I do.
Some of our best times together have always involved a big meal.<eos> Why don't I cook us a family dinner tonight?<eos> And we'll turn what was a day of sadness into a day of celebration.<eos> I'll cook pork chops and apple soup.<eos> Still Jacob's favorite?<eos> It's settled, then.<eos> I can already tell this day is taking a turn for the better.<eos> You're up early.<eos> How'd you sleep?<eos> I didn't.
- Just hold on a second, Lucy.<eos> - Shut your mouth, Fred.<eos> - It was an accident.<eos> - An accident?<eos> It was no accident that you went down to the river - to screw Sam Catlin.<eos> - Aunt Lucille, stop it.<eos> Adults are talking here, Maggie.<eos> If you had ended that affair when Henry told you to, my son would never have died.<eos> - I..i said that I am sorry.<eos> - Not to me, you didn't.
Certainly not.<eos> Then what is she?<eos> What have you gotten Captain Gregson into?<eos> This chance encounter between Miss White and Openshaw. It casts her withholding of Fordham's surveillance in a new light, does it not?<eos> Yes, I guess it does.<eos> It's likely her concern had more to do with protecting herself than Fordham's other clients.<eos> I think I know who we should ask why.<eos> Agent Boden, you were in charge of the surveillance unit tailing Fordham.<eos> If you knew he was in contact with Openshaw, if you knew Openshaw had crossed paths with Ms. White...<eos> I didn't.
I would say "two-wheeled..." donorcycles. - Oh.<eos> - You get it?<eos> - I do get it.<eos> - Do you get it, Jake?<eos> Because they all died. Okay, Kevin, I'm so sorry.<eos> I see your point, and I will talk to Kevin. I promise.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That would be great.<eos> For a minute there, I felt like I didn't know who you were.<eos> And now I do.
I shared it with the office.<eos> Ah, the Russian torrent sites have it now.<eos> I don't think you understand how sharing works.<eos> I agree.<eos> Why did you tell Zelda about Geronimo?<eos> What?<eos> You told Zelda. Zelda told Stephie.<eos> Now Stephie's using it to pretend to be some kind of psychic at me.<eos> I don't know what a Geronimo is.<eos> He didn't.
You take your low score, a-and you live with it.<eos> That's what we did, and we turned out okay.<eos> You know, this is really our fault.<eos> Always encouraging her, telling her she can do anything.<eos> We just got to be honest with her, Frankie.<eos> She's talking about all these private and out-of-state schools.<eos> She's go to know that's probably not going to happen.<eos> Well, we don't know.<eos> Pretty sure we do.<eos> Well, we don't.
Now, I don't know exactly when you intend to use this mirror, But you should know this.<eos> I won't allow you to hurt those I care about.<eos> And I won't allow you to derail my plans Because you've suddenly gotten sentimental.<eos> You only get one warning.<eos> Which is more than you get.<eos> I can't make any promises Over who may or who may not survive.<eos> You know, you were wrong before.<eos> That you needed leverage to get what you want?<eos> No, that I didn't have it.<eos> I do.
She came to this world looking for blondes?<eos> There's a lot more than just me.<eos> Don't I know it.<eos> She wasn't looking for a blonde.<eos> She was looking for the savior.<eos> What?<eos> This scroll... the writing is runic.<eos> It's a prophecy.<eos> It says, "the name of the savior is emma."<eos> Before you even did.
Ever more curious.<eos> He what? !<eos> Nygma, how many times have I told you to stay the hell out of here?<eos> But I discovered something.<eos> Out.<eos> Your loss.<eos> You sloppy ignoramus.<eos> Hi Bruce.<eos> Hi.<eos> Brucey! How you doing?
You didn't have a choice. You just love her so damn much. You're nothing without your love for audrey.<eos> You're just lifeless and numb.<eos> It really is sad how much you need her.<eos> Do you know in russia they call this... [russian accent] "game of string"?<eos> [normal voice] I tell you, they've got no imagination.<eos> - A lot of people need audrey.<eos> No one needs you.<eos> - Oh, they need me.<eos> They just don't know it yet.<eos> - Maybe william did.
What do you think, Bobby?<eos> Nothing to do with me, Brian, she makes her own decisions.<eos> I like it.<eos> Come on, then, tell us how me record did, I'm bursting.<eos> I can't find it.<eos> Number seven?<eos> Is that all?<eos> Seven is not to be sniffed at.<eos> And perhaps three number ones on the trot would have been a little greedy, don't you think?<eos> No, I don't.
Bad dates and heartaches.<eos> Why would you assume I had bad dates?<eos> I am a catch!<eos> There she is!<eos> The girl with the... attributes that Angus loves. Forget about Evie.<eos> Angus stood up and promised to love you for ever.<eos> Why didn't he tell me about her?<eos> Because he knew you'd worry about it.<eos> Because he knows what you're like and he loves you for it.<eos> He does, doesn't he?
Well, he takes his job seriously. He's a man after my own heart.<eos> Yes, but at the end of the day, you go home to your beautiful wife, whereas Henry goes home to a salad, usually.<eos> You can't make love to a salad.<eos> What can I do to help?<eos> Oh, find out who his favorite "FRIEND" is.<eos> And if he ever had the clap.<eos> Oh, sorry, sir.<eos> Uh, no, Henry, please, join me.<eos> Thought you had a private bathroom - in your office.<eos> - Oh, I do.
Every year.<eos> Got to get one of those hot mammas into the sack.<eos> Come, I have a surprise for you.<eos> Right, Preet, when I said obstacles I meant, like, a few hurdles.<eos> The most brutal obstacle course known to man.<eos> And I've got a truckload of attack dogs coming, too.<eos> Attack dogs?<eos> And how do you plan to control a pack of attack dogs with children?<eos> You've got a tranquiliser gun.<eos> Of course you do.
You got to do the work of two men and pay yourself for one.<eos> Just roll up those sleeves and address the task at hand, whatever it may be, not shying away from the dirty work, but just rolling up our sleeves and having at it.<eos> Success is not given. It is taken.<eos> It's time to get in the game and get dirty.<eos> All right, I'm going to lunch.<eos> Uh, yes, I'd like a chocolate chip cookie.<eos> Elmer!<eos> What, Mom?<eos> You promised I could get a cookie if I finished all my surgery.<eos> Did you?
I have to push it.<eos> It's all I can think of.<eos> Just let him push it.<eos> Who cares? No one is touching this button!<eos> Don't you see?<eos> This is a test of character...<eos> To see if we're the kind of people with self-control Or the kind who just grab at any piece of cheese That's put in front of them.<eos> Don't you want to know what it does?<eos> "want to know what it does"?<eos> Of course I do.
What'd he do?<eos> Tried to kill me.<eos> You serious? Yes, but he didn't, thanks to one badass cop.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> She sent him away.<eos> We've been best friends ever since.<eos> I like her already.<eos> She'd been through something similar, actually a lot worse than me.<eos> She's helped a lot.<eos> She still does, her friendship.
You sleeping with her?<eos> Is that any of your business?<eos> Well, she's a wealthy older woman.<eos> She funds your work.<eos> She put on your first show.<eos> Maybe when the money and the favors dried up, you decided to make her pay.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I have a video of you assaulting her in a parking garage.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm bowing out.<eos> - I want you to have this.<eos> - Come on.<eos> What? !<eos> Why are you doing that, coach?<eos> Because you obviously need this more than I do.<eos> When you look in the mirror, you see a fat kid.<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't know how that feels.<eos> I do.
Yet.<eos> Look... you gonna throw me off this case again?<eos> No.<eos> You do what you have to.<eos> You don't even need to send me reports.<eos> And I'm sorry about Sweets.<eos> I wish to hell I could turn back the clock.<eos> Wow, no reports.<eos> Never heard of that happening.<eos> It doesn't.
Relics and scriptures are placed there.<eos> So, to Durant, the files are his scriptures.<eos> Yes. You're saying that the-the files are still in the FBI?<eos> There's no way they'd be secure here for 20 years.<eos> It's not the institution that is holy.<eos> It is the man.<eos> It's J. Edgar Hoover.<eos> Hoover's office.<eos> Wait, Hoover's office doesn't even exist anymore.<eos> Yes, it does.
He told the whole country we were getting married.<eos> He didn't mean to. He panicked.<eos> What?<eos> Why aren't you more upset about this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> People kept coming up to congratulate me all week.<eos> It was funny and kind of touching.<eos> But I thought that you were against the whole...<eos> I know.<eos> So did I.
Good morning, Robert.<eos> Well, I'll be damned.<eos> It's our wacky neighbor.<eos> Ixnay on the snarks, my bro.<eos> Rose is looking after the garden while we're away.<eos> Hey, Gil, did you know Sarah Palin attacked you?<eos> - Really? - It's on politico.<eos> She kneecapped you on her channel last night.<eos> Sarah Palin has a channel?<eos> She does.
And I just spoke to Noah's doctor.<eos> So did I.<eos> She called me after finding the child's fractured ribs. Yes.<eos> Then you know that those injuries happened before I took custody of Noah, and that they've healed now.<eos> I'm not suggesting that you caused the injuries.<eos> I am troubled that you chose to go to work while your foster child remained in the hospital.<eos> I was called away for an emergency, and I'm doing everything that I can to get back there as soon as possible, believe me.<eos> I hope so.<eos> You do understand that your absence will be included in my report.<eos> Yeah, I do.
His state of mind is irrelevant.<eos> He's a murderer on a spree who gets set off by young women.<eos> He's got four of them as hostages.<eos> All your team should be working toward right now is move him into a position from which we can take him out.<eos> Look at him.<eos> Helpless, useless.<eos> You think he's better than me.<eos> I don't.<eos> He's not.<eos> Yes, you do.
My father ran away for all of us.<eos> Don't add up.<eos> Brujeria wielded a magic the world hasn't seen since God turned on the lights.<eos> He struck them down.<eos> Not even hell would give them asylum.<eos> They were annihilated.<eos> You don't believe her?<eos> I can't believe them.<eos> I don't have a spell to shut down the Brujeria, Anne Marie.<eos> Nobody does.
Hell and earth will become one.<eos> No more hiding like cowards in the shadows.<eos> We'll live in the open, and you'll be the ones hiding.<eos> But there'll be no hiding from us.<eos> You'll be ours.<eos> So that's what's on the way.<eos> Ambitious.<eos> Too bad you won't see it.<eos> You don't have the power to stop me.<eos> No man does.
Yeah, which is odd.<eos> Hargrove never used accomplices.<eos> All right, so who did Hargrove spend time with at Blackgate?<eos> Who did he communicate with on the outside?<eos> His entire stretch, he was isolated from gen pop.<eos> Never made or received phone calls.<eos> Only one visitor in those two years:<eos> His brother John.<eos> - Got an address?<eos> - We do.
Meredith, get up.<eos> We jumble things up.<eos> We lose track of time.<eos> We are in one place... And another.<eos> And it all feels like one long, inescapable moment.<eos> It's just like my mother used to say... The carousel never stops turning.<eos> I spent the day with Alex.<eos> I needed a day, Derek, so I took it.<eos> That's fine. I just need to know why.<eos> No, you don't.
I am sorry about the thing I said about your mother.<eos> Why?<eos> You meant it.<eos> It was in the heat of the moment.<eos> I just... You know, you wanted to hurt me, and you did that, so at least have the guts to stand by it.<eos> Will you just hear me out?<eos> You could do worse than compare me to a brilliant surgeon, but you meant it in the sense that I am cold and ambitious and selfish, a horrible wife and mother.<eos> I got that. Well, I love how you just switch it around so you can make it fit...<eos> You think I sound like my mother?<eos> You do.
Oh, god.<eos> Kind of funny.<eos> My dad died 25 years ago today.<eos> [ sneezes ]<eos> Ew!<eos> Right on the cake.<eos> I know.<eos> Keep watching. ...Nice to replace that sad memory with this happy one.<eos> [ sneezes ] Don't tell me uncle Mitch drinks it.<eos> Of course he does...
- Right.<eos> We've got to get cracking.<eos> 729 days to go.<eos> I hate that I know that.<eos> As to the flower arrangements, Senator, it's been a little challenging staying within the palette you gave me.<eos> Now, now, Miss Townsend, how tricky could it be?<eos> I said from coral to salmon. Quite a range.<eos> And Andy Guzman told me that "no" isn't in your vocabulary.<eos> - Did he?<eos> - He did.
Super funny, so, you have to... you have to do it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You have to do it.<eos> What do you mean, I have...?<eos> I don't have to do anything. Yes, you do.<eos> You have to do the prank. We thought of a great prank, and now it has to be done.<eos> Look at this. Text from Penny.<eos> "OMG. So excited for tonight, mon cher." She's so excited!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, but she does that annoying French thing.
It'll probably take you ages to find it.<eos> What?<eos> You're letting the heat out.<eos> Is your power off too?<eos> That's none of your bloody business.<eos> Um, we have a raw chicken here.<eos> Our electricity's off.<eos> Could I please roast this in your oven?<eos> I don't know you.<eos> No, no, you do.
Yeah. You have.<eos> But if you're interested, there might be something you could do to make it up to them.<eos> Well, Rick, sorry to see you guys go.<eos> Oh, yeah, me, too, but, uh, it couldn't be helped.<eos> Hey, there, cowboy.<eos> Where you off to in such a hurry?<eos> Beckett, what are you doing?<eos> We're gonna miss our flight. You got to be in the office by morning.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Well, Rick, sorry to see you guys go.<eos> Oh, yeah, me, too, but, uh, it couldn't be helped.<eos> Hey, there, cowboy.<eos> Where you off to in such a hurry?<eos> Beckett, what are you doing?<eos> We're gonna miss our flight. You got to be in the office by morning.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - Yeah, you do.<eos> - You don't have any personal days left.<eos> - Actually, I kind of do.
I still want to be with you.<eos> I want us to tell everyone what happened and just... Run away together.<eos> We can't do that.<eos> It's over.<eos> For real, this time.<eos> I had a feeling you might say that.<eos> Regardless, we still have to tell my father what happened between us. - What?<eos> - My shaman thinks it's really important for me to just come clean about all my lies.<eos> Your shaman doesn't understand the situation.<eos> - No, he really does.
Luckily, there are so many to choose from.<eos> Without betraying his old ones, I trust.<eos> I don't think my husband needs a lecture from you on betrayal.<eos> Do you accuse me of something?<eos> Oh, many things, I'm sure.<eos> But let's start with the betrayal of promises.<eos> Unless somehow your grain has arrived beneath our notice.<eos> She speaks for you in this?<eos> "She" is my queen.<eos> And, yes, she does.
I'm up for parole in three years, miss Pope.<eos> Which is why I'd understand if you want to drop this.<eos> Because if we lose this, we're not just talking about more time in prison.<eos> The Attorney General will go for the death penalty.<eos> You know...<eos> I read this thing in the paper a couple of years ago.<eos> Some lawyer type said - that the truth is like the sun.<eos> You can shut it out for a while, but it's not gonna go away.<eos> You believe in that, don't you, miss Pope?<eos> I do.
You can shut it out for a while, but it's not gonna go away.<eos> You believe in that, don't you, miss Pope?<eos> I do.<eos> I want the truth to come out.<eos> Then I better get to work.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you, both.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'm just trying to remember who said it... That thing about the truth and the sun.<eos> I did.
The issue is, Marcus, I despise that song with the white hot anger of a thousand suns.<eos> And, for some reason, I just don't feel like celebrating an imaginary fat man in a red suit.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Imaginary?<eos> Santa's imaginary?<eos> - No!<eos> - Marcus still believes<eos> - in Santa clause?<eos> - He-yes, he do!
It's okay.<eos> Ms. Boykin, do you still work for...<eos> Azo Charter?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> So, you were...<eos> I was...?<eos> You...<eos> Do you have a question, Ms. Tascioni?<eos> Do I?<eos> Yes, I do.
Oh, shut up, man!<eos> Come on, show us a bit of ballet then.<eos> No, I've told you, I've packed it in.<eos> Howay, just a little bit.<eos> Just a little bit.<eos> Just a little bit.<eos> Just a little...<eos> I can see why they call it The Nutcracker!<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Well, you do some dancing then.
~ Your ex-wife taking the piss?<eos> ~ No. Something about "same again".<eos> ~ Same again?<eos> ~ Yeah, thanks very much.<eos> ~ You do. ~ I don't. ~ You do.<eos> You always mention what she's wearing.<eos> That's because I don't like what she's wearing.<eos> You say it every time she comes on the telly.<eos> I never like what she's wearing. ~ I don't fancy Fiona Bruce.<eos> ~ Yes, you do!
Let me flip this one, put him to good use.<eos> We have plenty of KGB agents working for us already.<eos> But, sir...<eos> You've done well, Greer, but trust me, we need to erase the problem of Oleg Luski before anyone in his firm discovers he's a mole.<eos> Understood.<eos> Take a colleague.<eos> Luski's a dangerous man.<eos> And, Greer...<eos> This operation doesn't exist.<eos> They never do, sir.
There's drones out here.<eos> I don't want any more discussions, Eric.<eos> I don't want any more excuses.<eos> - Butters...<eos> - I just want to end this...<eos> - Okay. - So we can take our<eos> - punishment and be done with it.<eos> - Okay, Butters. Butters...<eos> I don't want all these drones everywhere.<eos> Nobody does!
Connor wasn't the only one developing the Mirror Man legend.<eos> You can't just leave me in here.<eos> I get a phone call and a lawyer or something.<eos> Anybody here?<eos> Hey!<eos> Stop yelling.<eos> Connor, you don't need a lawyer.<eos> You believe me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Hey!<eos> Stop yelling.<eos> Connor, you don't need a lawyer.<eos> You believe me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> But we need your help to find the real killer, and you know him.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I don't know anything, man.<eos> You do.
Although you are together every night, maybe you should see a bit less of her?<eos> Why would I want to do that for?<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> ~ You're beautiful, Trish!<eos> ~ Ooh, all right.<eos> I love you, Trisha!<eos> OK, Tom, dial it down.<eos> You don't really love her, do you?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You actually do.
I'm not playing that game.<eos> You're brave coming here.<eos> We hear some interesting artefacts were found on Bishop's farm.<eos> ~ Don't know what you're talking about. ~ Oh, I think you do.<eos> We haven't found anything, unless you consider drinks cans and barbed wire interesting.<eos> I wouldn't expect you two personally to have found anything.<eos> I'm referring to various items of a possible historical interest that were shown to you by farmer Bishop.<eos> Nope, sorry, you've lost us.<eos> Whether or not you found the items, you have a responsibility to report anything that could be considered treasure trove to the district coroner.<eos> No, we don't.

Can I have a lift?<eos> My hero.<eos> Cheers.<eos> ~ Have you seen Maggie?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> ~ Did you give her the money?<eos> ~ No.<eos> She didn't even remember if I take sugar in my tea.<eos> Do you?<eos> Course I do.
What about when you worked at the gap?<eos> Who told you about the gap?<eos> You, that time you were drunk, folding a sweater, and you tried to help me "spring into Summer" with cargo shorts.<eos> Fine!<eos> I fell into the gap.<eos> I needed the money.<eos> Maybe Sebastian needs the money, too.<eos> Who?<eos> [Knock at door] And if you ever tell anyone about the gap, you will have a gap between your neck and where your head used to be.<eos> "Oh, no you didn't."
Hilary's still here.<eos> And she called me a waitress.<eos> How dare her.<eos> She humiliated me, and I didn't even get a party this time.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> (Store manager) Hilary waldare, report to register three.<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Did he just say--<eos> (store manager) Hilary waldare. Register three.<eos> He did!
I was completing an assignment, sir.<eos> - An assignment?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Under whose orders?<eos> [Door opens] Agent Bixby, I'll take it from here.<eos> I'm not saying anything without an attorney present.<eos> You seem nervous, - Agent, uh, Larsen, is it?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - And who the hell brought Rowan into this? - Tom: As I said, I wish to exercise<eos> - my constitutional right to representation. - I did, Cy.
You heard anything from Jo?<eos> No, I don't think I will.<eos> Sam-Dog!<eos> - Yo. I got them, I got your skates, size 14.<eos> - No.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Don't mind him.<eos> He's just mad 'cause he can't do it.<eos> What? I could if I wanted to.<eos> I don't.
Thanks, I'm...<eos> Actually, we can't let you go yet.<eos> Not until Homicide gets your statement.<eos> Three months suspension from driving is like a death sentence.<eos> Who doesn't roll through a light?<eos> Hey, you were cleared of the wreck.<eos> Could have been worse. Huh?<eos> Yeah, says the guy who gets to drive while I'm in purgatory.<eos> I feel for you, man.<eos> Really, I do.
I didn't get to go to his funeral. Or Mom's. Or Hannah's.<eos> You were still in the hospital.<eos> Did you?<eos> Go to your father's funeral?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> I wasn't allowed.<eos> Do you miss him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I could do that, and it would make my life a lot easier.<eos> Yep.<eos> You could.<eos> You could absolutely do all of that, but you won't.<eos> Honey, that's not who you are.<eos> You don't just get into something and just walk away from it.<eos> I've known you for so long...<eos> Kristina and I know that deep down, you actually--I don't know.<eos> You like it. You like helping people.<eos> No, I don't.
Plus, how did they get on to a commercial flight without proper documentation?<eos> - Unless you don't fly commercial.<eos> Homeland Security is loath to inconvenience the rich and powerful.<eos> Pull information on private jets departing the same days our victims were abducted.<eos> Crosscheck tail numbers, see if you can find a pattern.<eos> Hello?<eos> Private property.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know anyone was here.<eos> Well, now you do.
So that later they can see the whole pattern.<eos> Understand it and retain it.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay, so did you always want to be a teacher?<eos> No, I didn't know what I wanted to do.<eos> Except go to college.<eos> Which for me wasn't really an option, unless I figured out a way to pay for it myself.<eos> That's how I wound up in the ROTC, and that's why I joined the Marine Corps Air Wing.<eos> Wait. Wait... s-so you, like, didn't even care about flying planes?<eos> No, of course I did.
Do you even know if this would work...<eos> At this stage?<eos> Do you?<eos> For all we know, this could hurt her more.<eos> Yes, he does know.<eos> He knows it works.<eos> Tell her.<eos> Tell me what?<eos> Tell me what?<eos> It does work, Maggie.
Bucky!<eos> You knew there wasn't enough time to stop the missile and save Skull.<eos> Come on!<eos> Hey, Cap, is now a good time to partner up?<eos> Hang tight.<eos> Thanks... partner.<eos> Hope Skull enjoyed his big day out on the town.<eos> You think Winter Soldier's gonna make another play for him? No.<eos> I'd like to believe he let go of that part of his past.<eos> Interested in doing some recon at a belarusian HYDRA base?
Who's that?<eos> Hey, turkey water!<eos> Pfft! Weak!<eos> I... I'm it!<eos> And just like that, the Thanksgiving we never wanted to remember turned into one we'd never forget.<eos> Thanks for the ride.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> And, uh, just so you know, I don't have a girlfriend.<eos> You don't?<eos> Well, I did. But, uh...
It's not that simple.<eos> Stop pressuring me.<eos> Okay, Julia, all right.<eos> Pressure's off.<eos> Chris. Chris!<eos> - Hey, Max.<eos> - Hi, buddy. We want to talk to you about what happened with Dylan, because I feel like we owe you an apology.<eos> I don't feel like we really gave you the full picture about what can happen in relationships.<eos> Remember when we talked about the numbers scale and how things can change?<eos> Well, sometimes they don't.
This is very serious. Got it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Now close your eyes.<eos> - I'm back.<eos> - Wait.<eos> I heard you went out early today.<eos> As I know, even academic schools don't start that early.<eos> Then call the school and ask.<eos> Do you go out early to sneak stuff out of the storage?<eos> No, I don't.
We have to assume that this weapon has the potential to do that.<eos> Because bad guys love their WMDs.<eos> Trick is, to activate the Obelisk,<eos> HYDRA has to take it to specific place.<eos> It's like they have the keys to launch a nuclear warhead ...<eos> Now they need the lock ... a temple inside the city.<eos> - Any idea where this temple is?<eos> - Glad you asked ... No.<eos> But it's in the city, and we now know where that is.<eos> Even better, HYDRA doesn't.
Like he said, we got nothing for you.<eos> Hey, Espo.<eos> Ryan and I did some real police work and found a Carlucci connection to the murder.<eos> Yeah, wait. What kind of a connection?<eos> Well, turns out the family's number two, Christopher Carlucci, owns a black Mustang.<eos> Guess what was stashed inside?<eos> A Santa suit. With blood on it.<eos> Christopher Carlucci, we need to talk.<eos> Why did you kill Eric Mercer?<eos> I didn't.
Jane, the roll of cash she spends on clothes could choke a horse.<eos> I even bought an imitation couture company, but the fake stuff isn't good enough for my girl.<eos> Right?<eos> Especially now. She's upset.<eos> She and Eric, they were very close, very close since they were kids.<eos> So you're admitting he was your doctor?<eos> I don't like that word, "admit."<eos> Acknowledging?<eos> Wow, Rick, me and you, we had a good relationship once, huh?<eos> We still do, don't we?
Dino.<eos> What news do you have for me, Rick?<eos> You come in here, to my house of business, and accuse my daughter of not one but two murders?<eos> Not accuse, as much as... Perhaps she's a person of interest.<eos> You think I don't know what that means?<eos> You disappoint me, Rick.<eos> I came to you.<eos> I put my faith in you.<eos> I thought we had an understanding.<eos> We did. We do.
Yo.<eos> Jane's alibi checks out. Doorman places her at home during Eric's murder.<eos> What about the street cams in the area around Luca Tessaro's shooting?<eos> We looked.<eos> There's no cameras out that way.<eos> Ugh. Which means we're dead in the water.<eos> Which means I could be dead in the water.<eos> If one of the Tessaros killed Luca and Eric, we need to figure out who it was.<eos> Well, unless you got a bud in that family, too, they're not gonna talk.<eos> Luckily, a credit card just did the talking.
But, you know, it made me think seriously about us. And where we are.<eos> Javi, I don't think we should do this here.<eos> No, I have to say this.<eos> Lanie, being fake engaged to you made me realize how great we are together.<eos> But not the way that your parents are.<eos> Or Castle and Beckett, or Ryan and Jenny.<eos> I know. I feel it, too.<eos> I mean, I'm crazy about you.<eos> And you deserve what they have.<eos> We both do.
- Okay, guys, I think we finally ditched him.<eos> - Ha ha. Very funny.<eos> I'm still on the line.<eos> So about that evil plan to destroy nuktuk...<eos> Hello?<eos> Anyone there?<eos> Guys! [dial tone beeping]<eos> - And with danger closing in, opal realizes<eos> How much she loves bolin and forgives him For whatever stuff he was talking about earlier Which will probably not be in the final cut<eos> Of the mover anyway. - She does?
He ran an illegal arms operation out of a compound in Canada.<eos> So... That's where you were the past 10 years?<eos> Malcolm smuggled me up there after I was stabbed.<eos> He forced me to launder money or he would kill Amanda.<eos> When I fled, I took evidence to protect myself.<eos> And now I have to find him to let him know that.<eos> Okay, scale of 1 to 10...<eos> How dangerous is this guy?<eos> - I don't really have a choice.<eos> - But maybe you do.
Following a G.P.S. signal on a bracelet.<eos> Which led them directly to someone they'd looked up online a hundred times.<eos> Sir. Maybe we should brief Mr. and Mrs. O'Hara on our progress.<eos> Ah. And let's get Hobbs in here.<eos> I think we're ready.<eos> You said that you have new information.<eos> Um, yes, we now believe that Annie was killed in her bedroom.<eos> What? I'm sorry, what...<eos> - What... are you saying this man...<eos> - No. No, no, that doesn't...
GLASGOWMAN WILL MEET US THERE AND TAKE US TO HIS MANSION.<eos> - I DON'T WANT TO.<eos> - CLOCK'S TICKING.<eos> IT'S THE NIGHT AFTER HALLOWEEN, AND MIDNIGHT APPROACHES.<eos> OUR MISSION IS ABOUT TO COMMENCE.<eos> - WHERE'S THE MAP?<eos> WHERE'S THE MAP?<eos> - YOUR SISTER PROBABLY LOST IT.<eos> - DID NOT. MIA TOOK IT.<eos> - I DID NOT.
He's a Greek national that arrived here five months ago on a legit passport.<eos> He's also one of the people that Minas turned on, ID'd as a PK member.<eos> Why wasn't he picked up after Minas outed him?<eos> FBI was searching for him, but he was in the wind.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks, Eric.<eos> Kouris was in L.A. before Minas was.<eos> If Kouris wasn't sent here to kill Minas... what did PK send him here to do?<eos> I mean... you believe they put a known terrorist in witness protection and just lost him?<eos> Yeah, I do.
There you are.<eos> Look, I need to talk to you about something.<eos> Hello, Natalie, what did you want to talk about?<eos> I'm thinking of leaving Brownall.<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> Well...<eos> I... actually quite like you a bit and I think that you like me?<eos> Yeah, I do, I really do.<eos> I do.
It's okay.<eos> It's exciting how much we have to discover about each other, isn't it?<eos> Wow!<eos> What?<eos> Nothing, I just... No, I just meant, like, you and I feels right, doesn't it?<eos> I mean, it feels like we've known each other forever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It doesn't feel right to you?<eos> It sure seemed like it did.<eos> No. Sure it does.
PUT THIS BACK ON THE TREE AND MAKE YOUR WISH.<eos> WAIT, WAIT.<eos> ALL RIGHT.<eos> MAKE YOUR WISH.<eos> WHAT'S THE POINT?<eos> IT ALREADY CAME TRUE.<eos> JUST DO IT. [ TWINKLE! ]<eos> OOH.<eos> IT DIDN'T WORK.<eos> YEAH, IT DID!
It just sets children up to fail, and it destroys their self-esteem.<eos> - Right there.<eos> - Is he there?<eos> Is -- where --<eos> Where did she point?<eos> Where did she p--<eos> Now I look like Rod Stewart.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> I have a head for business and a bod for sin.<eos> Yes, you do.
Oh, no. Tell me you guys didn't break!<eos> You talked, didn't you?<eos> I did, Stan!<eos> I talked, I sang, I acted some of it out!<eos> The missile...the inhaler...<eos> and the C.I.A. That one was hard to act out, but the little guy, he got it!<eos> Man, he got it.<eos> He's -- he's amazing at charades.<eos> I talked, too!<eos> We all did!
Cleaving yourself from the dagger so you can leave with your power.<eos> Emma told me Belle confessed about knowing Anna.<eos> Still. Quite the supposition.<eos> Why else would you care?<eos> Anna's a danger to you.<eos> You can't have your blissfully ignorant wife...<eos> Lose either her bliss or ignorance.<eos> Watch Anna. Make sure she comes nowhere near this shop.<eos> Well, if I had the choice...<eos> Well, you don't.
That was a rather risky endeavor for an old glove, dearies.<eos> URSULA: Well, the risk was worth it.<eos> For too long, we've lived in a world where the heroes always win.<eos> And the Gauntlet will reveal our enemies' weaknesses. And we will be the victors.<eos> MALEFICENT: Let her go.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I mean, with that object, you...<eos> They still won't be able to harm you.<eos> Why do you care about me?<eos> I don't.
Ok.<eos> Please don't ask my mother for her opinions.<eos> You heard that? Yeah.<eos> I've got superhearing.<eos> I hear everything.<eos> Only when you listen.<eos> Why?<eos> Why was I listening?<eos> Why do you have a thing for me?<eos> I don't.
Good-bye.<eos> Adios.<eos> Hasta luego.<eos> Gracias.<eos> Hasta luego.<eos> Muchas gracias.<eos> Bye. Por nada.<eos> Yes, Agent Hanna, this is the gym bag with the money.<eos> How much did you say was in here?<eos> I didn't.
Then I look forward to meeting her.<eos> Trust is a rare thing in this world.<eos> Stop, Henry! don't do this!<eos> I can prove that what I told you is real.<eos> Please, Henry!<eos> I won't lose you all over again!<eos> I'll come back to you, and then you'll see that my story is true...<eos> I'm immortal.<eos> Put it down if you love me.<eos> I do.
Multiple lacerations on the face Indicates a possible struggle prior to death.<eos> C.O.D. -<eos> - Incised wound to the carotid artery. But this wasn't done by a knife.<eos> It's too irregular.<eos> Do we have a murder weapon? No.<eos> And something is off here.<eos> An english noble takes a stroll through central park In the middle of the night.<eos> Somebody stabs him to death, But doesn't take his wallet?<eos> The story doesn't make sense.<eos> Well, neither does the history.
- What about the adoption?<eos> - Isn't that what married people do?<eos> You know, all this time, you never asked me if I ever really loved you.<eos> Because I know the answer.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> You told me if I gave you Berlin that you would let me go.<eos> I knew the second you brought me down you had no intention of letting me leave.<eos> So here's the deal, Liz.<eos> You're gonna do whatever you're gonna do. You always have.<eos> Just do me one favor.
I guess once a thief, always a thief.<eos> I'll take that as a compliment.<eos> So, have you thought of a plan when they discover her remains are missing? They won't.<eos> The coroner needs a fresh corpse.<eos> That's why Eva Braga's bones were in storage.<eos> Do you seriously think a couple of dusty eggheads can help us find the killer?<eos> I guess you could say that science is a hobby of mine.<eos> I like to think that it could be the key to solving crimes.<eos> Don't you have faith in science?<eos> Course I do, darling.
He was your captor.<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> I'm trying to understand... to understand your experience as a captive.<eos> Whether it somehow tainted me.<eos> I love you, Ichabod, but I cannot fight two wars at once.<eos> Despite your words to the contrary, clearly you've lost faith in my judgment.<eos> As you have in mine.<eos> You left to the enemy den without so much as a note.<eos> To kill the demon Moloch...<eos> Which you did not do.
- So, what do you want to do?<eos> - I want to do this.<eos> Jordi: All right? I'm sick of them.<eos> I'm sick of this place. I'm sick of being sick.<eos> Everyone needs a friend, right?<eos> Does that answer your question?<eos> I'm gonna need a rush on Charlie Hutchison.<eos> He's being transferred to convalescent care,<eos> I had to report you for falsifying Charlie's lab work.<eos> How did...
It's just like when I eat in front of you.<eos> You get so proud, like you're some type of hero, like you fixed me or something!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Emma, I never wanted to fix you.<eos> - I just wanted... - You wanted me to be normal.<eos> I know.<eos> But I'm not, and I'm never gonna be.<eos> Don't say that, Emma.<eos> I know you, and this...<eos> No, you don't!
You were wrong.<eos> I'm not getting out.<eos> Apparently, I need more time.<eos> But it's good.<eos> It means we can work this out, you know, and still be in here together.<eos> Actually, no.<eos> I had my meeting with Dr. Samuels, and she said that I could go.<eos> My dad's here now.<eos> He's filling out paperwork. They released you?<eos> They did.
You can wait here if you'd like.<eos> I'll get you some wine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Joseph...<eos> Dinah?<eos> Joseph.<eos> I didn't... I didn't know.<eos> For years, I cursed our brothers for what they did to me, until I realized God's purpose behind it... To bring me to Egypt, so that I could foresee the famine that awaited its people.<eos> Did you dream of it?<eos> No. No, the pharaoh did.
- Hey, chief.<eos> - Nathan. - [sighs] they're out of lobster, So, you might want to try the gull, yeah.<eos> - Yeah, all right.<eos> - You sent a man ahead to check for you?<eos> - I got to keep my officers busy.<eos> Haven's a quiet town.<eos> - [screaming]<eos> - What was that?<eos> - Uh, locals. They get upset When places run out of lobster.<eos> - You done?
- You selfish prick.<eos> I'd sooner turn you in to cdc headquarters Then let you kidnap an innocent woman.<eos> - We need to work together. What are you doing?<eos> - I'm the chief of police, and the leader of the guard.<eos> You want to know what haven's going to do?<eos> Whatever I decide.<eos> Not you who only even thinks about audrey. And not you who only looks out for himself.<eos> - But we can't just leave her in there While an epidemic of troubles blast this town.<eos> You want to lead, you better have a plan.<eos> - I do.
Oh!<eos> - You're wearing costumes.<eos> - Well, sure.<eos> Pumpkins can't move on their own... can they?<eos> - Ha.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> - Good thing I didn't take this off.<eos> You guys find this place as<eos> - creepy as I do, right?
- I'm killing myself working two jobs To pay for a house that i pray you and the kids come back to.<eos> There's no way i'm gonna agree to that.<eos> It ain't gonna happen.<eos> Look, it's over.<eos> I got to accept that,<eos> But, laura, please.<eos> You're treating me like i'm some part-time dad, And you know i'm not.<eos> - Asher, just come back inside.<eos> - You don't make a fool of me. - Ha!<eos> You did that all on your own, sweetheart.
They make safes here?<eos> Complex security systems.<eos> High-end, top of the line, very expensive.<eos> The Ghosts stole a safe?<eos> No, they just broke into one.<eos> The system they breached, TD-9000-- brand-new technology, can be used on any size vault.<eos> More than a dozen interlocking composite-steel bolts, reinforced receiving cups, ten-gear release mechanism.<eos> This could withstand a 9.0 quake or an industrial thermal lance.<eos> Yes, but our witnesses said they got in with a glass of water.<eos> Th-They did what?
Case like this, if you don't close it, it becomes a sore-- won't heal.<eos> I didn't want him to have that.<eos> What happened on the roof...<eos> I don't feel bad about what happened.<eos> You know me, I don't... I don't have those kind of feelings.<eos> I got to go see Sylvester.<eos> Oh, there he is.<eos> Man, you'd just do anything to get out of work, huh?<eos> Hey, pal.<eos> How you doing, kid?
- Why?<eos> - It'S...<eos> It'S Not So Easy To Explain.<eos> - You Can'T Do This.<eos> - He'S Got Me In A Really Bad Spot, Vanessa.<eos> - What Is It--Blackmail? Don'T Even--<eos> Don'T Even Say Anything.<eos> You Don'T Have To Say Anything.<eos> - I-I Really Don'T Have A Choice Here.<eos> - Mr. Truman, Yes, You Do.
No, come on. Hetty didn't tell me anything.<eos> Actually, she specifically said that she didn't tell me anything.<eos> You can fool everyone else, Deeks.<eos> Can't fool me.<eos> So, you want to talk about it?<eos> Not really.<eos> Like it was even me anymore.<eos> Just a... just a different person.<eos> Well, I wish I would've known her.<eos> No, you don't.
Listen, kid, nobody in the Pines family is welcome here.<eos> In case you forgot, your stupid brother is the one who ruined my life!<eos> And Mabel's the one who's gonna fix it.<eos> Listen, Robbie, I always used to see you as a creepy jerk.<eos> Like the human version of rat poison.<eos> Uh, go on.<eos> But when I saw you in the cemetery today, I realized, Robbie's not a bad guy.<eos> He's just a heartbroken soul who needs love-- and gloves with fingers.<eos> Hey, fingerless gloves look awesome.<eos> No, they don't.
If you believe her, I've slept with every married man in Beverly Hills.<eos> Well, why would she say that?<eos> Do I need a lawyer?<eos> Would you like a lawyer?<eos> No.<eos> I'd like to leave.<eos> I've done nothing wrong.<eos> How could you not tell us about the book?<eos> You didn't think it was important to our investigation?<eos> No, I didn't.
Hey, how about this little guy?<eos> That one's kind of young.<eos> I don't even know what kind of cards he prefers.<eos> Then he's perfect for us.<eos> What should we name him, Kenny?<eos> I know.<eos> How about McNuggets?<eos> Hey, McNuggets.<eos> You want to come play for us?<eos> "Yes, I do, you guys."
Not one spell cast before he was obliterated by health drains.<eos> That thing isn't human!<eos> Your rooster's up next, boys.<eos> I don't think he wants to play, dude. He doesn't have a choice.<eos> But this isn't even a fight.<eos> This is just a slaughter.<eos> What do you think all these people are here to see? Holy shit, dude!<eos> Dude, we forfeit!<eos> We forfeit!<eos> The hell you do!
She is so excited.<eos> The McCarthys Original air date 20/11<eos> What's with all the pills, Marjorie?<eos> You look like Betty Crockpot.<eos> Does he mean Betty Crocker?<eos> Yeah. But he really means Betty Ford, who was an alcoholic and not a pill-popper, so none of it makes any sense.<eos> These are vitamins and supplements.<eos> You could get one of those "days of the week" pill containers.<eos> Those are for old people.<eos> I do my drugs like the young- randomly and by the handful.
I'm on board, Duke.<eos> Find the aether, and we could do that a thousand times over.<eos> You have an angry energy, and I like that in bed.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> Do you believe me that I want to help you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, I have to, right?<eos> You don't have to.<eos> You do.
Right?<eos> Because removing trees is strictly prohibited.<eos> Because violators will be punished to the full ex--<eos> I'm just reading from the big sign that we saw when we got here.<eos> That sign that says, "Things you should not do."<eos> That one.<eos> It's Christmas, Danny.<eos> All right, you and Gracie need a tree.<eos> - You want a tree?<eos> - I do. I did. But not like this.
She grabbed a pair of scissors.<eos> I was terrified she was gonna stab me, but... she was crazy.<eos> I couldn't see it burned so badly.<eos> How long has she been a client?<eos> 6 weeks. I mean, she was always so nice. I don't know why she would do this to me.<eos> You're her second victim.<eos> She was talking you both in plain sight, getting to know you, sitting in your chair, figuring out your schedule.<eos> First victim was a bus driver Henry White.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> No, I don't.
She said, "no,"<eos> but he forced her down.<eos> And the Cori tried to run.<eos> And I grabbed her, and I held her down until he could finish.<eos> She wanted you to feel her pain.<eos> You stood there, watched, did nothing.<eos> That's why Cori burned your eyes.<eos> I didn't know what else to do.<eos> I loved him so much.<eos> I still do.
Well, we all make mistakes. One morning, I woke up married to this one.<eos> See, bottom line, this wasn't part of my five-year plan.<eos> You know, law school, clerk for a judge, start my own practice.<eos> Wow, that's-that's impressive.<eos> Uh, Alan's son, Jake, had a five-year plan for the tenth grade.<eos> See, that's why I liked your profile.<eos> You have parenting experience.<eos> Your sense of humor came through.<eos> And I kind of love that you're gay.<eos> Not as much as we do.
I don't know what it is yet, but I'm gonna find my passion, create a business plan, and get a loan.<eos> Lacey, I'm so proud of you.<eos> I will give you that loan.<eos> But, Daddy, you're poor.<eos> Yeah, Daddy, you're poor.<eos> Yes, Charlie, I'm poor.<eos> So how will I do this?<eos> Do you by chance have a small account in another country, the funds of which were not touched by your tragic financial collapse?<eos> No, I don't believe so.<eos> Well, of course you do.
Let's keep it light.<eos> Light, light, light!<eos> Why J.D., I'm so glad you could make it.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Holly, it was just so nice of you to invite me to your home.<eos> You know, all of a sudden now this city seems a lot friendlier and prettier, too.<eos> J.D., you know, I want you to feel totally comfortable.<eos> And since you don't know anyone, I think you should stick close to me, real close.<eos> You sure know how to make a guy feel welcome.<eos> Yes, I do.

Richard would be using the brand new 5.2-litre V1 0 Lamborghini Hurácan, the long-awaited replacement for the Gallardo.<eos> And I'd be using this.<eos> The equally new McLaren 650S, which comes with a twin turbo 3.8-litre V8.<eos> Now, you're probably sitting there wondering why neither of us has chosen to use a Ferrari 458.<eos> And that's a good question because it is a magnificent car.<eos> -It is.<eos> But it has one massive flaw.<eos> -Mmm.<eos> -James May owns one.<eos> -He does.
It is.<eos> That'll do 202 miles an hour.<eos> The McLaren will do 207.<eos> It's more powerful, it's got more torque, it's lighter...<eos> There's no point even discussing speed, and I wasn't going to.<eos> I was going to say...<eos> I don't think your car looks very nice.<eos> -No.<eos> What?<eos> -It doesn't.
It's taking it all seriously. That might be a Jag, but it's mental. It's lunatic.<eos> Even I can slither about in that and sort it out.<eos> It's...<eos> -It's...<eos> -It's got a sticky front and a loose back end.<eos> -And who doesn't like that?<eos> -Yeah, exactly.<eos> Not a phrase for a first date, obviously.<eos> No, exactly.<eos> But I do like...
Yes, I know, but the three-litre's got carburettors, yours, you...<eos> I want the three-litre 'cause...<eos> You've got a fuel injection?<eos> I don't want fuel injection.<eos> I want cars, it's a classic car.<eos> No, no.<eos> The 2.8 is classic.<eos> You know, you want a Capri 2.8.<eos> -No.<eos> -You do.

Bow, smile, walk away.<eos> Walk away.<eos> HERCULES: It could make sense.<eos> But why hide it?<eos> Prison brand is not the kind of thing you'd want everyone to see.<eos> It doesn't add up.<eos> It's not a triangle, Pythagoras, it doesn't have to add up.<eos> Do you trust him?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nothing, she's great.<eos> Everything's great.<eos> And that's a good thing, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just don't have any excuses now.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I gave her up so that she could have this great life.<eos> And she does.
Rob, I don't know what to do.<eos> Find somewhere safe.<eos> Safe and warm. A cafe on the seafront.<eos> I'll find you.<eos> I know how hard this must be to hear.<eos> I should have listened to her.<eos> There were bottles of pills, yes.<eos> Bottles of drink, so... yes, it looks like an overdose, but there's no way to be certain of anything, at this stage, except that it wasn't your fault.<eos> Shirley didn't want me to go looking for Tom.<eos> No, she didn't.
We'll be waiting in the car.<eos> A.J.?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Hi, Daphne.<eos> Bay is not here.<eos> She just left.<eos> - You might be able to catch...<eos> - It's okay. I came to see you.<eos> I'm really sorry that we ruined - your Christmas Eve last night.<eos> No, honey. You didn't.
He didn't say.<eos> But he asked me to pick him up at this theater playing Hard Kill, that it would be easy to find. He sounded so desperate.<eos> But when I got there<eos> (LOWERED VOICE) he was dead.<eos> Why didn't you tell us this before?<eos> (SOBBING) I panicked.<eos> (SIGHS) I'm trying to restart my career.<eos> I just knew how it might look.<eos> Well, that's because it's exactly how it does look.<eos> CASTLE: Well, not to me it doesn't.
No, I've flushed them all down the toilet.<eos> I hate tropical fish!<eos> Yes, even Elton, hah!<eos> Greg?<eos> Greg?<eos> Holli Vavasour?<eos> Go away.<eos> Can we have a chat?<eos> How did you know I was in here?<eos> I didn't.
She gave us the high voice. "They're cute!"<eos> I know the voice. I invented the voice. I use the voice.<eos> Wait. So, I can't pull off mid-thigh shorts?<eos> No, you can.<eos> Pull them off and give them to somebody 20 years younger.<eos> You're so silly!<eos> What are you two giggling about?<eos> Haley just asked me --<eos> Oh, you don't want to know, trust me.<eos> No, I do. I do. I do.
What are you guys doing?<eos> - Uh, nothing. - Just talking.<eos> - Not really anything.<eos> Can we finish our conversation?<eos> No.<eos> Lily, I'm sorry, but if you have questions, you're gonna have to ask your dads.<eos> You don't know, do you?<eos> - I do so.<eos> - Uh-huh, I know.<eos> No, we don't.
It's so stupid.<eos> I've known the guy, what, a few days?<eos> No, no, it's not stupid.<eos> It's not.<eos> I think it's a sign.<eos> You've changed. Whether you like it or not.<eos> Falling in...<eos> Love can do that to a person.<eos> You don't see it, but we do, you know?<eos> I do.
Of course.<eos> What about Narcisse?<eos> Did you get to him?<eos> No. No, he disappeared.<eos> But I will find him.<eos> - I was going to visit my brother in Navarre, but I turned back as soon as I heard the news.<eos> She's fine... getting some much-needed rest.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Francis, you must know my loyalty lies with you.<eos> I do.
Look, Flynn worked here.<eos> You're the second victim's uncle. Sons of bitches.<eos> My nephew is dead.<eos> My sister's world has just ended.<eos> And you come in here and you throw accusations?<eos> Maybe I'm dirty, too.<eos> I helped Flynn rip this place off, and then, for no good reason, pulled Casey in.<eos> No one is accusing you of anything, but you're the only connection we could find between the two victims.<eos> We just wanted to know if they knew each other.<eos> They didn't.
You don't want rocks.<eos> Well, it was definitely time to stop.<eos> - Yeah. - Draw? - Shall we call it a draw?<eos> - Yes. - We can call it a draw.<eos> Do you remember where the road was?<eos> Which side did we come onto the lake?<eos> - That side, I think.<eos> - No, we didn't.<eos> - We came from that side.<eos> - No, we didn't.
I brought this for us.<eos> You know, third rule of parenting: Kids aren't the only ones that can drink from a bottle.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, there.<eos> I pour strong when the alcohol's free.<eos> I have to cram a lot of fun into a short amount of time. ALAN: Mmm.<eos> Kind of like sex with Roger.<eos> What is it with guys and their constant need for sex?<eos> Look at Alan here.<eos> He's out with two women, but I bet even he wants sex right now.<eos> I do.

So, Connor got 402.<eos> Tonka got 402. And Curtis got 402.<eos> What?<eos> There's no winner. They all scored the same.<eos> No!<eos> What do I do now?<eos> It's kind of spooky.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Like God wants you to have three boyfriends.<eos> No, he doesn't.
I'm guessing this one is Larry.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Aha! I knew it.<eos> I knew.<eos> It's not my peers who brought down my average.<eos> It's my peer.<eos> One anonymous peer, one bitter, "hell hath no fury like a woman scorned" peer who gave me an "F" and called me a bit of a poop.<eos> Who, I ask, do you suppose would resort to something so infantine?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Well, I do.
(phone rings) MOLLY: Don't answer it!<eos> Don't answer it! Don't answer it!<eos> Don't answer it!<eos> No!<eos> Whoa!<eos> God, why not?<eos> 'Cause it's my publisher.<eos> And he wants the book.<eos> Do you have a book to give him?<eos> 'Cause I sure as hell don't.
You were setting up some reindeer games.<eos> I like your gift, sad woman.<eos> The peppermint oil is great for the massage... yes?<eos> I'm number nine, and I'll take the massage from Maurice.<eos> Or whatever it is.<eos> Okay, well, it's a new turn, so I guess I can steal anything.<eos> Uh-oh. I think I see where this is going.<eos> I think we all do.<eos> Say good-bye to that bobblehead, Maurice.<eos> Maybe we all don't.
One minute.<eos> Slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly.<eos> OK, you got it?<eos> OK.<eos> I'm in.<eos> The lifts are secure!<eos> Oh, you caught it.<eos> ~ I did!<eos> ~ You bloody caught it!<eos> Yeah, I did.
It feels strange to go back in, right?<eos> No.<eos> That's a relief.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey Kang Soo.<eos> Come here.<eos> Now, it was when I was a little older than the age you are now.<eos> I was against the Taesupa gang. Just me against all of them.<eos> Did you hear about it? The legend of legends. - No.<eos> - You didn't?
But I'm okay now.<eos> Oh, I got a long vacation this time.<eos> Four days and five nights!<eos> You got a vacation of four days and five nights?<eos> While I stay here, you will ditch work. And hang out with me the whole day.<eos> Where should we go?<eos> - What is this, I just said that as a joke.<eos> We should go somewhere.<eos> - You became nicer!<eos> I did?
Isn't that very painful? !<eos> It will be fine if we immediately perform surgery to remove it. She will be fine.<eos> Nothing is wrong, right?<eos> Don't worry so much.<eos> Even if something were to happen, I have this dependable son-in-law, so what's there to worry?<eos> Mom. Mom, are you alright?<eos> This girl, what's all this fuss about?<eos> Did you tell her that I was here?<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> I did, Mom.
I made the weight.<eos> Tomorrow I'm gonna ace that test.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> What happened?<eos> Hit it on something stupid.<eos> In what investigators are calling a gangland-style execution, five men were killed at some point last night in an office above this restaurant.<eos> Police sources have said the killings have all the earmarks of a turf war between rival factions.<eos> Names are not yet being released...<eos> How's it going?<eos> How you doing, sir?
Pushkin.<eos> Pushkin.<eos> I...<eos> Pushkin's money.<eos> What the fuck you give a fuck, Andri?<eos> Is that a Heckler Koch?<eos> - This?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What is he saying?<eos> I don't fucking...
Think of it this way, all these different parts of the knot are like subatomic particles - electrons, protons - that hold the different parts of the molecule together.<eos> Now, to untie the knot, enzymes have to move protons about. But as you can see, this takes quite a bit of effort and a lot of time if there are many knots to unpick.<eos> Physicists have a fancy way of saying "put in effort to get something done".<eos> They say you have to overcome an energy barrier.<eos> OK, here's my energy barrier. And here's my proton.<eos> To break a bond apart, it needs enough energy to get over the barrier.<eos> The trouble is, when we work out how long this would take, it's much too slow to break down a tadpole's tale.<eos> But this is where protons turn into ghosts.<eos> I wouldn't blame you for thinking that this is an idea that a clever theoretician has come up with, that it's just mere speculation - something that we have no proof of.<eos> But we do.
- He is marooning us.<eos> I'll meet you guys downstairs.<eos> Go wait by the car.<eos> Come on! Give me your bag.<eos> Get in the backseat.<eos> Get in the backseat now!<eos> Dr. Mann, please respond.<eos> Dr. Mann, please respond!<eos> He doesn't know the Endurance docking procedure.<eos> - The autopilot does.
How the planet grew hotter as our fuel was burned.<eos> How we made towers to work the weather.<eos> But the truth is... one day... it started to snow.<eos> And it never stopped.<eos> Hey!<eos> Is that what I think it is?<eos> Weather modification.<eos> Never seen one this close before.<eos> You think it still works?<eos> It did its damage a long time ago.
Uh, I asked him.<eos> I don't care what he calls himself.<eos> I don't like him.<eos> BALIN:<eos> We do not have to like him.<eos> We simply have to pay him.<eos> Come on now, lads.<eos> Turn out your pockets.<eos> How do we know he won't betray us?<eos> We don't.
But far more precious.<eos> VOICE OF THE RING:<eos> Precious!<eos> Precious!<eos> There you are Thief in the Shadows.<eos> I did not come to steal from you O Smaug the Unassessably Wealthy.<eos> I merely wanted to gaze upon your magnificence.<eos> To see if you really were as great as the old tales say.<eos> I did not believe them.<eos> And do you now? !
- I have to go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, man!<eos> What about it?<eos> Goddamn, Uncle Red.<eos> - Look like they fed you pretty good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're fit as a racehorse.<eos> How you doing?
Paid me with this.<eos> Do not touch rock!<eos> Rock cursed.<eos> lnjun's right.<eos> Worthless around here.<eos> But get it to San Francisco, they'd pay a thousand dollars cash.<eos> Maybe I'll be on the first train west.<eos> Retire.<eos> Do you have cat?<eos> I did.
Sure.<eos> Hey, how's your sister?<eos> She's fine.<eos> She talk about me?<eos> No.<eos> So, Friday, we'll all go down together.<eos> Make a road trip of it, I'll drive.<eos> Don't think I can.<eos> I think I've got a doctor's appointment.<eos> Yeah, you do.
What are you, five pubs in?<eos> Foun<eos> Oh, not even halfway.<eos> Plenty more fun to be had.<eos> Enjoy your night, Peter.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> The way I see it, we've told everybody we were doing The Golden Mile.<eos> You did.
You don't know him like I know him.<eos> Is this the kind of life you want for yourself?<eos> It's a job, Rose.<eos> And it pays better than getting two.<eos> Yeah, and you know what they call that kind of job.<eos> That's not what this is.<eos> Look, he's old.<eos> He doesn't like me just for that.<eos> Do you even like this man?<eos> Yeah. I really do.
So I think it'd be a good thing for us... if we were able to see other people, too.<eos> I don't mean like you and me.<eos> I mean, nothing will ever be like us.<eos> I just know there are things that I like to do that you don't... and things that you like to do that I don't.<eos> And I just think that we're in such a good place that we can allow each other... you know, to do that and still love each other and stay together.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, if that's what you want.<eos> I think it'd be good for us.<eos> I really do.
My will.<eos> - Did you ever execute this will?<eos> Did anyone witness your executed will?<eos> When you mean "executed", uh...<eos> I didn't sign it yet.<eos> - I mean--<eos> - He doesn't understand "executed" to mean signing.<eos> What did you mean when you said "executed"?<eos> Well, you mean, did I ever sign it?<eos> No, I never did.
- of a living organism. - Exactly.<eos> Yes.<eos> - What? - Can you not touch my plant?<eos> It's not... She doesn't like it.<eos> She prefers...<eos> She's not like the others.<eos> Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.<eos> - Happy...<eos> Leave her ficus alone.<eos> Because... And, no, seriously, don't.
What the... What is that?<eos> You're wearing this in the house now?<eos> What is that, like, Mark 15?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Something like that. You know, everybody needs a hobby.<eos> And you have to wear your hobby in the living room?<eos> Just breaking it in.<eos> You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so...<eos> Well, hey, did you see your Christmas present?<eos> Yes, I did. I...
I didn't even mention New York.<eos> Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.<eos> Okay...<eos> God, what am I gonna do?<eos> Just breathe.<eos> Really, just breathe.<eos> You're a mechanic, right?<eos> Right.<eos> You said so.<eos> Yes, I did.
Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing.<eos> Hi, Trevor.<eos> Trevor Slattery.<eos> I know I'm shorter in person.<eos> A bit smaller.<eos> Everyone says that.<eos> But, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on.<eos> Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.<eos> You tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.<eos> Doing what?
Please don't go.<eos> Billy. No, please.<eos> Billy, please don't...
Guy's exhausted.<eos> He's also malnourished and dehydrated.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> He showed up last night completely out of the blue.<eos> I haven't seen the guy in 20 years.<eos> I didn't even recognize him at first.<eos> Comes inside, we sit down, he starts telling me this crazy story.<eos> What's the story?<eos> How do you know him?<eos> I don't.

She's been through a lot.<eos> And if there's one thing that she doesn't need any more of from anyone, it's pain.<eos> Please don't hurt her.<eos> He likes you.<eos> Do you like him?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> Well, he still likes you.<eos> I got your suit cleaned for you.<eos> They didn't, um..
Are you aware of Miss Stubbs' claim that she threw a pink garbage bag... Containing a butcher knife with Rusty Berkhart's fingerprints on it... Into Dehunger River?<eos> I can't say that I actually heard her saying that now.<eos> I'm reading from Lacey's January 26th statement.<eos> I put the knife into a pink trash bag.<eos> I drove over to Stoneyville bridge and threw it in.<eos> Is that a question?<eos> Did police search the Dehunger River?<eos> I believe so, no bag was found.<eos> And did you participate in that search?<eos> No, I did not.
- You're so excited.<eos> - I know.<eos> I can't stand it.<eos> Gosh.<eos> Remember the day that we met?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you ever think that someday you'd be able to...<eos> - you know?<eos> - Honestly, no.<eos> No, I didn't.
Do I have to do it myself?<eos> Do you think I come here to admire the view?<eos> Sorry uh, I'm sick.<eos> Why?<eos> Why, what's the matter?<eos> I don't know, I'm... I all run down.<eos> I need money real bad.<eos> — What?<eos> — My wife and I, we wanna go west.<eos> Oh, your wife does?
(GRUNTING)<eos> Erik severed the link between giants and men."<eos> ISABELLE'S MOTHER: "And peace returned to his kingdom again.<eos> The mystical relics were all that remained safe with Erik through the years that he reigned.<eos> And when time came at last for King Erik to sleep he took crown and seed with him for permanent keep."<eos> JACK'S FATHER: "And as the king's bones slowly crumbled away truth became legend."<eos> Or so people say.<eos> What will happen when the giants come back?<eos> They won't, son.<eos> - But what if they do?
I came to say goodbye.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> It was Gormenberg behind all this you know.<eos> I suspect he knows where your parents are.<eos> Can I come?<eos> Not today.<eos> But I'll be back.<eos> Captain.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You did well, Mariah!
That's the choice you have to make.<eos> I've made my choice.<eos> I know what I heard.<eos> He's not a person anymore.<eos> No, he stopped being a person when he took our daughters.<eos> I need your help.<eos> This is your last chance.<eos> I know you're scared. I know you wanna go home.<eos> All right? I know. I don't want to hurt you.<eos> I don't.
I, uh...<eos> I keep dreaming about being lost in a maze.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Heh.<eos> Alex never talks very much so when people come over here, I hardly know what to say.<eos> He doesn't talk much?<eos> Well, he talks. Good morning, good night, that sort of thing. Hard to get too much more than that out of him.<eos> Had an accident when he was little.<eos> After that he started choosing his words a little too carefully.<eos> - What...? What kind of accident did he...?
What the hell did you take?<eos> I have no idea, but they were bowing to it.<eos> Kirk to Shuttle One.<eos> Locals are out of the kill zone.<eos> You are clear.<eos> Repeat. Spock, get in there, neutralize the volcano and let's get out of here.<eos> We have to do this now!<eos> I told the Captain the shuttle wasn't built for this kind of heat.<eos> Captain, did the indigenous life forms see you?<eos> No, Mr. Spock, they did not.
Uh, yeah.<eos> Margarita?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> - You like porno?<eos> - I like some.<eos> You like 'em.<eos> - No. - I can tell.<eos> - Yeah, you do.<eos> - I don't.
No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, baby.<eos> Wives can't testify against husbands.<eos> Look, all I need is money.<eos> Look, after paying your bail, I have, um, 32, 33 dollars.<eos> Linda, real money.<eos> It's the IRS and the Miami PD, and it's all just that shakedown.<eos> - Do you have enough?<eos> Baby, do we have enough, right?<eos> - No, we don't.
- Yeah.<eos> No, look, the point is, we traffic in fantasy here.<eos> Yeah, she's very real, the kind of girl you sit next to her in class.<eos> You see her out on the street, you want to ball her.<eos> But, you know, you've seen the girls that come in and do this now.<eos> I mean, they've all been to the surgeon.<eos> I mean, you can't light your cigarette around 'em.<eos> You're afraid their tits are gonna go up like the Hindenburg or something.<eos> - Linda has tits.<eos> - She does. Nice ones, too.
Finish her already.<eos> Revenge doesn't change the past.<eos> It won't bring our parents back.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> But it sure as hell feels good.<eos> My sister and I know the truth.<eos> We know who we are now.<eos> And so do they.
There's a link.<eos> You were right.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hello. Hi.<eos> Hey, I heard the good news.<eos> - Allen, she's in Cincinnati.<eos> - Cincinnati?<eos> They could hardly believe it.<eos> Yeah, well, they believe her now, huh?<eos> They do.
- Hi.<eos> Come in or whatever.<eos> I just jogged over here to feed the cat.<eos> If I don't shower right away my pores get all clogged and I get this, like, zit nest on my forehead.<eos> So why are you feeding the cat?<eos> So it doesn't starve to death.<eos> - But why can't Chantry feed it?<eos> - Because she flew to Dublin.<eos> She flew to Dublin?<eos> Yes, of course she did.
No, just smarter.<eos> Yeah, beaten by a girl.<eos> Woo!<eos> Okay, water break.<eos> Oh, yeah. Stop, Tombi. Don't.<eos> Oh, yeah. Stop. Enough already.<eos> What's the matter, hotshot?<eos> Sore loser?<eos> Why do you care what they think?<eos> I don't.
What is a dream?<eos> What's real?<eos> Is life just a big stage, and are we all just...<eos> Bradley, snap out of it!<eos> Boys, enough!<eos> Don't look back, only forward, all right?<eos> We don't even know which way is forward.<eos> What is forward?<eos> Who even knows where we're going?<eos> I don't!
But I had to take it for my mom's sake.<eos> Mamochka?<eos> When she died, I had no one left but ballet... and my promise.<eos> Mamochka?<eos> Mama!<eos> So I jumped like a grasshopper and walked on my tippy toes and watched everyone else eat their cookies.<eos> You remember what this oil refinery was like when I bought it? Like a tomb.<eos> And now look.<eos> So tell me, why don't you want to modernize the plant now?<eos> Of course I do.
Does that mean you're not going to hand me over?<eos> That must be the Russian-embassy guy now.<eos> This doesn't mean that I'm going to let you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It just means that I trust you're not gonna run out on me.<eos> Mama, Mama.<eos> The man from the theater is lost again.<eos> - Sheriff? - Yeah.<eos> - How did you know I was a fugitive?<eos> - I didn't.
Man, you gotta earn a living.<eos> I'll sort things out.<eos> Except I need you to stay, Terry.<eos> The whole family's gotta put up a united front for Ig.<eos> - Hey, buddy.<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - Lee.<eos> Lee, if you want some food, we have a lot of leftovers from lunch.<eos> Oh, I grabbed something on the way over, Mrs. P. Thank you.<eos> How you guys doing?
Hey, hey, hey. Why don't you take one of these. Just take one.<eos> They're fun.<eos> Take the edge off.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> I need to release what I'm feeling tonight.<eos> God, you're beautiful.<eos> You know that?<eos> Can you pull over?<eos> I need to get out of the car.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, I didn't...
Research, when I was trying to find you.<eos> No one comes up here anymore.<eos> We have the place to ourselves.<eos> This is breathtaking.<eos> Sorry, there's no cake.<eos> Well, everyone should get something for their birthday.<eos> - What did you get?<eos> - Weapons, mostly.<eos> - I'm sure that doesn't surprise you.<eos> - At this point nothing really does.
Ain't we good over here?<eos> You get your pants cleaned...<eos> We got it straightened out.<eos> Right, we got it straightened out.<eos> Drop the goddamned bag.<eos> Is this 1201 Belmont?<eos> I ain't shitting you, man.<eos> Okay. I think I got the wrong house.<eos> Yeah, most-fucking-likely.<eos> No. He don't.
There's over $4,000 there.<eos> I didn't trouble counting it.<eos> What's going on, John?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Hey, you remember that farm?<eos> We used to talk about buying that farm.<eos> - You remember that?<eos> - You used to talk about it.<eos> I don't want to live on no farm.<eos> Sure, you do.
Thanks, coz.<eos> You know, you're a lot more like me than you care to admit.<eos> Well, nobody's perfect.<eos> Lena, you have great powers. I can teach you how to use them. I can teach you how to become the most powerful Dark Caster who ever lived.<eos> Oh, that's so sweet of you, Mama. Oh, baby.<eos> This mortal you think you love? You can never be together.<eos> I know.<eos> Did you ever love me, Mama?<eos> You know, I don't remember.<eos> No mother does, really.
It's pretty messed up. You know, there's a million people to talk to out there.<eos> I know. It's what I get for hiring Eric, I guess.<eos> That is what you get.<eos> Dad?<eos> Were you seeing Juliana... before or after Mom?<eos> Definitely after.<eos> Good.<eos> Your mother was the love of my life.<eos> You know that.<eos> No, I didn't.
Farewell, be trusty and commend me to your mistress.<eos> I... There's one thing more.<eos> What is it?<eos> There is a nobleman in town, one Paris, who plans to marry and lie with her.<eos> - And does she like him?<eos> - Never!<eos> She would as soon have lain with a stinking toad.<eos> Her thoughts are all with you, as I have taunted her.<eos> - But you should know of him.<eos> - And so I do.
Not Romeo, Prince.<eos> He was Mercutio's friend, and killed his murderer.<eos> The very end the law would have exacted.<eos> This offense means we do now, at once, exile him hence.<eos> I will be deaf to pleading and excuse.<eos> Therefore, use none.<eos> Let Romeo leave in haste.<eos> For if he's found, that hour will be his last.<eos> Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?<eos> It did.
Your life has no meaning, Dad.<eos> When you're gone, who's gonna notice?<eos> Where the hell are you going?<eos> Oh, uh, I'm leaving.<eos> That's what you do when you grow up.<eos> Did he say why he wanted to see me?<eos> When your Uncle Ralph calls, I don't ask questions.<eos> Just the kid.<eos> Chris, just be cool and you'll be fine.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
How many times?<eos> You don't say "he."<eos> - You know who I mean.<eos> - That's not the point, all right?<eos> He, your father, will be in Freeport, and he thought it would be nice for you guys to fly down together and spend some quality time.<eos> He'll probably check out the camp.<eos> You know, he loves watching you.<eos> So...<eos> He loves to tell me what to do. He doesn't know shit.<eos> Well, does he?
Marshal!<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> PENTECOST:<eos> Not now, Mr. Gottlieb.<eos> I'm sure you can appreciate how important this moment is to me.<eos> Newton created a neural bridge from garbage and Drifted with a Kaiju.<eos> I found him prone and he's sort of dazed.<eos> I don't exactly know what to do.<eos> I told you it would work.<eos> Yes, you did.
I figured out how to Drift with a Kaiju.<eos> Are you funning me, son?<eos> It's fascinating how their minds work.<eos> Every single Kaiju his mind's connected.<eos> The species has, like...<eos> Like a hive mind.<eos> (THUNDER RUMBLING)<eos> Holy jeez.<eos> You've gone and done it, haven't you?<eos> I did it a little bit, yeah.
Of course.<eos> Excuse me...<eos> - I use it for work, building work.<eos> What kind of work do you do?<eos> Telecommunications. I am a technician.<eos> And who do you work?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Who do you work for?<eos> Siemens!<eos> Well, I did.
Something good will come your way.<eos> I hope so.<eos> I heard you did quite well in silicon valley. Yeah, I made a lot of money Off these two high-tech start companies...<eos> Nct software and mad solar.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Let's toast to that.<eos> Yes. To success.<eos> To success.<eos> Did you get a chance to read my script?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Now hold it.<eos> D-D-Don't...<eos> Hold it tight.<eos> -Don't let it slip! -Oh, shit!<eos> Get that soap, Cécile, and get it now!<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Stupid soap is in here somewhere.<eos> No, no!<eos> No, don't.
How about a Sky Slycer Mark Five?<eos> Wait, that's your propeller.<eos> You could still win the race.<eos> Oh, I intend to, but with my old propeller.<eos> This one didn't really suit me.<eos> But I think you will have a lot better luck with it.<eos> Thanks, Ishani.<eos> Dottie, can you fix me?<eos> Does a PT6A have a multi-stage compressor?<eos> Yes! Yes it does.
This is charming.<eos> And Wine.<eos> Then I shall never leave.<eos> - Oh, watch the...<eos> - Sorry.<eos> And I didn't know how I could get rid of him.<eos> And then what did you say?<eos> Well, what I should have said was,<eos> "Mr. Andersen, though your Ugly Duckling has delighted, "you've slept in this room for five weeks now and you must go home. "<eos> - But you did not.
And Wine.<eos> Then I shall never leave.<eos> - Oh, watch the...<eos> - Sorry.<eos> And I didn't know how I could get rid of him.<eos> And then what did you say?<eos> Well, what I should have said was,<eos> "Mr. Andersen, though your Ugly Duckling has delighted, "you've slept in this room for five weeks now and you must go home. "<eos> - But you did not.<eos> - I did not.
Wash yourselves.<eos> The water supply section... Wash away the blood.<eos> Have you seen these kids?<eos> I don't know anything about...<eos> Where are they, you bitch?<eos> I don't know, it's not me.<eos> Tell us or we'll cut your arm you bastard.<eos> Wilford knows.<eos> Wilford likes kids.<eos> He does.
- Me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah, I'll come by and pick you up.<eos> How's that sound?<eos> Okay?<eos> - Is that an answer or a question?<eos> - No. it's an answer.<eos> - If you don't want to go-<eos> - No, I do.
People loved us.<eos> They loved you because you were little and cute.<eos> The guys liked you.<eos> They loved you.<eos> Thought you were a hot little muchacha.<eos> - You liked it.<eos> - Well-<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Uh-huh. - He knew how to make friends at least.<eos> Damn right, he did.
There were a lot of other girls there with problems. Could have been anyone.<eos> I got on with everyone.<eos> Did you have a girl named Mousey at your school?<eos> No... I don't think so.<eos> Now, I'm sorry, but I have to go.<eos> Miss Merrick, I know what you've been through.<eos> I know it must have been extremely painful.<eos> I really need your help.<eos> Do you have any specific memory of Anna you think I should know?<eos> Yeah... sure I do.
Pablo Chacon.<eos> Turns out there's a real Pablo Chacon and we stole from him.<eos> So this is probably gonna end well, I would imagine.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> No rush.<eos> I thought you said we were picking up drugs for Pablo Chacon.<eos> I thought we were.<eos> Brad told me he was Pablo Chacon.<eos> - Why do you trust that guy?<eos> - I don't, okay?
- Appreciate that.<eos> - She learned a new word, Rose.<eos> - Thank God. "I'm sorry."<eos> Un-fucking-believable.<eos> It's gonna be great.<eos> Oh! There he is.<eos> Kenny!<eos> - Okay, let's go.<eos> - Oh, my God, you look so much better.<eos> - Doesn't he?
They don't exist, but wish jars do.<eos> You want something in this life worth something, then write it down, put it in a jar, and bury it.<eos> So I did.<eos> And guess what?<eos> It worked.<eos> I've been burying things ever since.<eos> Is that why you buried them?<eos> You don't believe, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I do. I do.
Do you have any water?<eos> Can-can you get me out of here?<eos> Are you still there?<eos> I think I already told you.<eos> I don't want any.<eos> Hello?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Does it fuckin' matter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it does.
I'm gonna die in here, aren't I?<eos> - No.<eos> - I don't wanna die alone.<eos> He left the shovel.<eos> I can get you out of there.<eos> The ground is still soft.<eos> - I can dig you out.<eos> - You'll never get me out of here before he gets back.<eos> Do you want to live or not?<eos> Of course I do!
Buddy, any chance you were on top of my car?<eos> No.<eos> Okay. 'Cause there was a dent in the roof.<eos> Big dent.<eos> It popped out.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I was just wondering if you knew anything about that?<eos> We did have bags up there, honey.<eos> That's true.<eos> We did.
So you thought you'd just open up?<eos> What're you?<eos> Some kind of wise guy?<eos> I'm still your superior.<eos> A cup of coffee in my hand.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> Okay.<eos> We don't sell coffee.<eos> Burn!<eos> Yeah, we do.
It's more than a pinpoint, bruce.<eos> I read the report.<eos> It's more than one, and...<eos> And it is inconsistent with anything but a defensive...<eos> Bruce...<eos> A defensive movement.<eos> And the angle of the shot is inconsistent.<eos> The only way he walks...<eos> I think he's not guilty.<eos> Of course you do.
All right, now.<eos> You're really out.<eos> That's Frank.<eos> How's Pop?<eos> Uh, it depends on the day.<eos> They took him off the ventilator though this morning.<eos> You wanna go see your kids? No. I wanna see Pop.<eos> Pop, what are you doing up?<eos> That's you, boy, that's you!<eos> How you doing, Pop?
Well, the mayor's been getting these anonymous letters.<eos> You know, and some of his people have too, and, you know, they're not too happy about it. Wait, wait.<eos> You knew about our records, so did the commissioner, right?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> But, this guy, you know, he's gonna make a stink with the whole city.<eos> So, I mean, what do you want with me?<eos> You said it was as good as done!<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what you said!<eos> Right? Right! I did.
Get the fuck out, get out!<eos> Right, come on guys!<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> You can't go with them?<eos> Nothin' I can do.<eos> Nothing you can do.<eos> Okay.<eos> I think that's bullshit.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
A woman who will live with her husband's mother and family.<eos> Someone from within the clan.<eos> And what about you?<eos> What are your feelings?<eos> I want to save people's lives.<eos> Hasnat, I asked about your feelings.<eos> I love you.<eos> But do you want us to be together in spite all of our problems?<eos> Do you want to make this work?<eos> Yes. I do.
- I had no idea that you could be so...<eos> - Sophisticated?<eos> Slutty.<eos> There are things on this list that I haven't even done, Brandy.<eos> This is awesome.<eos> So you're gonna scam on other guys and then hook up with Rusty?<eos> No offense, but how?<eos> You said yourself he's out of your league.<eos> - I never said that.<eos> - I did.
If it wasn't for the police academy and the good Lord<eos> Let's just say this tattoo is a crude obscenity... that I'd rather not say the meaning of.<eos> Well, what a gentleman you are.<eos> Nighty-night, Simon.<eos> Night.<eos> You manipulate me like that?<eos> Good heavens odd one, I manipulate you every day.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yes. Gently, of course, and with great affection and you always like it.<eos> Oh, I do?
Did I say I wanted to commit to you? I'm confused. Oh.<eos> No, I was just worried.<eos> Okay, well, don't worry, I'm not gonna stalk you.<eos> It's funny, because I thought I was talking about what I wanted and, uh...<eos> - Yeah, you were.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I wanna hear what you were saying.<eos> - You sure?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You're their last resort?<eos> 'Cause interest rates are north of 12% and heading to 18%.<eos> That's right, smarty pants.<eos> Fucking Jimmy Carter.<eos> Fucking Jimmy Carter.<eos> Well, fucking Nixon, really, and the war and the deficit and all of that shit, but...<eos> I fucking love you, you're so smart.<eos> You are.<eos> Thanks, kid, but how do you get them the money? Well...<eos> You don't, do you?

Suspensions, detentions, a Special Ed class?<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> Did you read the rest of it?<eos> Why, am I missing a police record?<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Quit half-assing it, huh?<eos> You play like that, those Ecuadorian kids are gonna eat you up!<eos> Jeremiah got the top score on eight Advanced Placement tests without ever taking the Advanced Placement courses.<eos> And his SATs are almost perfect.<eos> God, did he...
Okay, now.<eos> Leann, leann.<eos> Oh, my God, oh, my God!<eos> (Both sobbing)<eos> I heard Tyler screaming, and when I turned around, he was gone.<eos> He was gone.<eos> It's pretty beat up.<eos> I don't know how much longer it's gonna record for.<eos> Do you really think filming this matters anymore?<eos> Of course it does.
I'm sorry. I just... I just realized how tired I am.<eos> You know, I think I am going to take a little nap in the study.<eos> Would you take this box to my bedroom?<eos> Yes.<eos> I heard her on the monitor too.<eos> Yes, it's okay.<eos> Oh.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't like it when you do a pee-pee in your diaper.<eos> No, you don't.

Come a little closer and you can see how it's done.<eos> Now, you always have to remember to support her head a little bit.<eos> You start with the cute little feet first.<eos> I want to eat those feet they're so cute.<eos> And then your cute little butt.<eos> Look at that little butt.<eos> Oh, you wiggle worm.<eos> And then we snap you up.<eos> Ooh, and we eat you up.<eos> Yes, we do.
- I'm afraid it's ruined.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> So you think I'm chaotic?<eos> Unpredictable.<eos> Well, I hope it didn't ruin your appetite.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> You shaved your beard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> I do.
Well, I hope it didn't ruin your appetite.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> You shaved your beard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> I do.<eos> But I liked your beard.<eos> It reminded me of my father.<eos> Well, I hope you like your father.<eos> I did.
Hi.<eos> I'm having lunch.<eos> Listen, Dad...<eos> You're a married man, for Christ's sakes!<eos> How dare you do this to Susan and Kyle?<eos> How dare you do this to Pauline?<eos> Did you...?<eos> Does she know you have a wife and kid?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yeah, she does.
Hello?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> No problem.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have to leave for a few days.<eos> Zada, you can take the reins from here?<eos> All right, give me a kiss.<eos> Can we go to the beach when you get back?<eos> MJ really wants to. No, I don't.<eos> Yes, she does.
He's not answering.<eos> We should've taken him to the doctor's yesterday.<eos> We should've...<eos> I'll go up.<eos> What?<eos> You thought I died?<eos> We came to pick you up.<eos> We're not working today.<eos> I told you.<eos> - You didn't.
Boom!<eos> Check out my well-designed endorsement poster.<eos> What's your point, Tito?<eos> My point is, we got a chance to change our lives for the better.<eos> To make Starlight Plaza the great place we all know it could be.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> Who's ready to sponsor the next Indy 500 champion?<eos> Sorry, Tito, but I've got work to do.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> None of you do.
He'll call. And they'll work. Why do you say that?<eos> Because it all makes sense.<eos> I mean, think about it. They want the most ruthless one of us to join them.<eos> I mean, it's like how they used to pick the next Catholic Pope, back in the Holy Roman Empire.<eos> They'd take all the nominated Bishops and they'd lock them in the Sistine Chapel together... to fight it out until there was only one left.<eos> And it was believed that the one who survived was ordained and chosen by God.<eos> You know? It makes sense, right?<eos> That's exactly the kind of fucked up shit you'd expect from the Catholic Church.<eos> You got something against Catholics?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you think? Don't fight the impulse now, Lindsey. Uh...<eos> No, I don't...<eos> That's okay.<eos> No, thank you. I really don't want to do that.<eos> What? I don't want to do that.<eos> Why not?<eos> I think you do.<eos> No, I don't.
That's okay.<eos> No, thank you. I really don't want to do that.<eos> What? I don't want to do that.<eos> Why not?<eos> I think you do.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Come on.<eos> Why not? So many reasons.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I just don't do that.
No, thank you. I really don't want to do that.<eos> What? I don't want to do that.<eos> Why not?<eos> I think you do.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Come on.<eos> Why not? So many reasons.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I just don't do that.<eos> You don't what?
I don't know what you guys do around here all the time.<eos> When's this asshole gonna get here?<eos> Well.<eos> All right, here he comes.<eos> Nicolas.<eos> German.<eos> You wouldn't know anything about a missing silver shipment, now would you?<eos> Because, you see, I intended to take that shipment myself.<eos> Sure.<eos> Sure I do.
Not this time, Tommy.<eos> The stakes are too high.<eos> Ain't no rules in this game, Tommy.<eos> You got that right, jackass.<eos> Still here.<eos> No need for that.<eos> Let's go.<eos> It's good to see you, Tommy.<eos> You mean that?<eos> Yes, yes I do.
If the Hive goes down, this whole city goes dark.<eos> Question here.<eos> Why do they call it the Hive?<eos> Listen.<eos> Hear all those little worker bees?<eos> Hey, what about Max?<eos> You know he wants to bone you, right?<eos> Oh, my God, Autumn.<eos> Stop it, that's disgusting.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
This is an extra key to my apartment. Why?<eos> What for?<eos> If you ever need your own space, or you just want to get away from Larry or Steve, it's there for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, funny enough, Larry's the reason I go home.<eos> I don't want to leave him alone with my mother.<eos> Steve just doesn't understand that.<eos> I understand.<eos> You want to protect your mother.<eos> Every daughter does.
I couldn't free myself of the image of Jerome and his careless elegance.<eos> And during this time, when I was with other men, I forbade them to touch my body with their hands.<eos> And soon, I stopped having sex altogether.<eos> I tried to meet him all the time.<eos> I found out where he lived, but of course, never dared ring his doorbell.<eos> I even started humiliating myself on purpose in order for him to notice me.<eos> You broke a taillight.<eos> I did.<eos> I thought you were such a wizard at parking.<eos> So did I.
You understand?<eos> You don't come?<eos> No, I don't come.<eos> If I go, they'll be looking for us the rest of our lives, you and your sister will never get settled.<eos> You'll wind up dead or in jail.<eos> But what do you do here?<eos> They blame you.<eos> They say you kill him by yourself.<eos> Well, I did. Didn't I?<eos> Yes, I did.
Stop the car.<eos> I don't want to do this anymore.<eos> - What?<eos> - I changed my mind.<eos> Alan, you can't change your mind.<eos> Everybody's counting on you.<eos> I'm fine just the way I am.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> Turn the car around.<eos> Now, please! I don't...
I would have gotten further except for the damn leg.<eos> I'd be grateful if you let me stay till nightfall.<eos> I'd try and help out.<eos> I wouldn't ask anything of you.<eos> You just did.<eos> Nothing more than a place to lay low and rest my leg for a few hours.<eos> How do I... How do I know you won't hurt us?<eos> I've never intentionally hurt anyone in my life.<eos> You understand how that could be hard to believe.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I learned a lot.<eos> It's all businessmen.<eos> Hey, how many grams of protein do you eat?<eos> How you fixed for a job now?<eos> Well, it's not good.<eos> It's kind of hard when you got a record.<eos> It doesn't feel real good when Mickey D's tells you you're not even good enough to make the French fries.<eos> Doesn't mean we have less right to a piece of the pie.<eos> Amino acids after you work out or before?<eos> So you do it with smoothies, like, fruit smoothies,
I'm gonna take you home.<eos> Clean you up.<eos> Would you pass me a roll, please? Sure.<eos> You have some tiny trees. That's sort of my hobby. Shit!<eos> No, I can do it. I can do it.<eos> Come on, let me help. I... Ed!<eos> There you go.<eos> Every man needs to fight for his dignity.<eos> I have a boat.<eos> Sure you do.
Jerry McGuire.<eos> Dad, let's go.<eos> I'm taking my art then. That's it.<eos> I'm taking the art.<eos> It's my art.<eos> I paid for it.<eos> I bought it.<eos> I picked it out.<eos> I got it.<eos> No you don't.
Yes, but how?<eos> Well, for starters, stop dressing like you're totally easy!<eos> I thought this was sort of sexy.<eos> It's American Apparel.<eos> It is sort of sexy.<eos> It's very, very sexy.<eos> But it doesn't leave much to the imagination.<eos> I guess.<eos> You want to go shopping.<eos> I do.
Malekith sought to use the Aether's power to return the universe to one of darkness.<eos> But, after eternities of bloodshed my father Bor finally triumphed ushering in a peace that lasted thousands of years.<eos> What happened?<eos> He killed them all.<eos> Are you certain?<eos> The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them, and yet here it is.<eos> The Dark Elves are dead.<eos> Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?<eos> No.<eos> It does not.
You do that. Good luck. Bye bye, Benny.<eos> I'm gonna have Cooney signed by the time I get back.<eos> [Spitting] Who doesn't have a door knob'?<eos> How are you supposed to get out of the closet when. You're trapped in the closet?<eos> Your chariot awaits. Oh my God.<eos> This is gonna be so great. [Barking]<eos> Aww, how sweet.<eos> He likes you.<eos> Ooh, somebody needs a doggie mint.<eos> Yes, you do.
Or should I say all four?<eos> No one can hear us in here.<eos> Now we can talk.<eos> I'm here to tell you that Henriette, my husband and me, we're all in favour of you.<eos> So we thought you might first have a word with your parents, then could come out to Kirchwiller and ask for Henriette's hand.<eos> But you mustn't wait too long, otherwise it'll show at the wedding.<eos> You understand, don't you?<eos> She deserves to be married in a nice dress, such a nice-looking girl as she is.<eos> You understand what I'm saying, don't you?<eos> I do, but...
Watch out!<eos> I always dreamed that one day I would either be a fireman or work with animals.<eos> It'd be so cool.<eos> Where's your family?<eos> Why you want to know that shit?<eos> 'Cause you're just like all the other squares.<eos> I got guys asking me all the time what happened, where my folks think I'm at.<eos> You wanna fuck me?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> No, Cindy, I don't.
Jiro<eos> Let him go<eos> You're back<eos> I'm back<eos> There are guests in the room waiting for you girls to come<eos> Be<eos> Brother you this villain<eos> Kayo ah ah sorry I totally forgot<eos> Really<eos> Dad does
- Holy smurf, I'm a downer.<eos> - You most certainly are.<eos> Grouchy, the only way we'll be extinct is if Smurfette gives Gargamel the secret formula.<eos> - But Smurfette would never tell. - Of course not.<eos> - Never.<eos> - Absolutely not.<eos> Smurfette could never be tricked into being one of them.<eos> Hey, Smurfette. Did you do this with your sisters back in Smurf Village?<eos> Lots of flying, but I never had a sister.<eos> Well, you do now.
Anger's his constant condition.<eos> Sit.<eos> Sit and drink the tea that I offered.<eos> What'n be Epps's concern?<eos> I'd rather not say.<eos> Oh, little gossip on the Sabbath be fine.<eos> All things in moderation.<eos> As you are aware... Master Epps is a man of hard countenance.<eos> You know he has ill feeling towards your husband.<eos> He do.
I seen one of them critters in Orleans.<eos> Know just as much as any nigger I got.<eos> Listen, Epps. These niggers are human beings.<eos> If they are allowed to climb no higher than brute animals. You and men like you will have to answer for it.<eos> There is an ill, Mr. Epps. A fearful ill resting upon this nation.<eos> And there will be a day of reckoning yet.<eos> You like to hear yourself talk, Bass... better than any man I know of.<eos> You'd argue that black was white, or white, black... if anybody would contradict you.<eos> A fine supposition if you lived among Yankees in New England.<eos> But you don't.
Maryland residents can rest easy tonight, knowing that the killers who terrorized the suburbs of Washington, D.C. are now behind bars.<eos> You stop that now.<eos> That's enough!<eos> You know that's the way it go.<eos> You want to eat, I'm gonna have to work.<eos> I'm gonna come for you as soon as I can.<eos> You want to be a spoiled child, then?<eos> Please, papa, can I have one? One what?<eos> I didn't get anything.<eos> Yes, you did!
Hey.<eos> Your watch.<eos> Oh, my goodness. Morning.<eos> Oh, morning.<eos> Anyone else in the vehicle with you?<eos> Oh, it's my son.<eos> Uh, I just picked him up from camp late last night.<eos> There's no overnight parking in the rest area.<eos> Did you see the signs?<eos> No, I didn't, sir.
- You didn't believe her?<eos> - I did at first.<eos> - You be careful!<eos> - I wasn't. - No?<eos> - No.<eos> - I thought you were.<eos> I thought that...<eos> I wasn't worried, it was him!<eos> I thought you believed it at first.<eos> No, I didn't.
Oh, absolutely. Sean Fanning's one of the smartest people I've ever met.<eos> He was teaching himself how to program and he saw this really simple way to find music that he could listen to on the internet.<eos> Here was a guy with no clout, no connections, 19 years old and he really changed the way we think about the internet.<eos> It's hard to explain where things were at back then.<eos> I mean I was 18, I didn't really, I hadn't really seen much of the world.<eos> You know, I didn't really...<eos> Um, I think it was, I mean the best way to say it is it kind of came from a very pure place.<eos> I was excited 'cause he was my first.<eos> So I thought, you know, I really did think he was gonna conquer the world.<eos> Everybody does with their first kid, right?
All of these things really conspired to you know uh, produce an amazing consumer experience.<eos> Welcome to Valley of the Dollars.<eos> The valley and the entire Bay Area, in fact, are at the center of a revolution...<eos> This was the you know, uh, height of the bubble.<eos> Uh, in the valley, you know, uh, in, in the Bay Area and in San Francisco, um, there was a euphoric amount of optimism.<eos> Anywhere that you went, um, people were happy.<eos> Because everybody thought that they were gonna be filthy rich.<eos> Whether they were involved in a startup or not, um, it, there was, it was a magical time.<eos> You thought you would be filthy rich.<eos> I actually never did.

That was his natural course and this is ours?<eos> Don't you see, Erol, despite everything I like this life.<eos> I like who I am. And I fell in love with you as you were here.<eos> Grace, as I am, I'll make a terrible father.<eos> I don't want to pass this down to our child.<eos> - I want a clean slate. - Nobody has a clean slate!<eos> Because nobody gets the chance to have one.<eos> I can't live like this, knowing our lives could end<eos> - at any second and we have no say.<eos> - Most people don't.
- Oh, my goodness.<eos> You must be freezing!<eos> - Oh, I'm fine.<eos> Let's get you some coffee to warm up. Okay?<eos> No. I don't want coffee.<eos> I have an ulcer.<eos> - Some herbal tea, then.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> That's fine.<eos> I don't...
You can tell me.<eos> She left a suicide note and it blamed me for basically everything.<eos> The thing was printed off the computer.<eos> I was married to that woman for 16 years and I never once saw her use that computer.<eos> Sometimes I think about stalling over again.<eos> Finding a new woman to share my life with have another kid.<eos> Try and do it right this time.<eos> We never do get a second chance... to fix the big fuck-ups in our lives, do we?<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't
For fuck sake, and should have stopped, they were just stringing you along, they were just pretending..<eos> And having sex whenever they felt like it, and laughing at us behind our backs.<eos> And you're saying you had no idea what was going on?<eos> -That's enough.<eos> - Ian, we are not alone. - What difference does it make?<eos> Ian, what are you taking about?<eos> I just walked across the street and found your - husband rolling around on the floor with my mother.<eos> - What?<eos> - You heard me. - Ian..<eos> Don't fucking Ian me..
Detective Robin Griffin.<eos> Southern Lakes police.<eos> So?<eos> I'm wanting to chat with Tui, if I may?<eos> You could if she was here.<eos> Is she at school?<eos> I doubt she's at school.<eos> No.<eos> Do you mind if I come in and look around?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm alone.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're fine.<eos> Wolfie, Wolfie, it's fine.<eos> I didn't do nothing.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I didn't do nothing.
Al, I'm going to pull a car over.<eos> Speak to you tomorrow.<eos> Licence, please.<eos> Hi, simone.<eos> -Where are you all off to?<eos> -Book club.<eos> - What you reading?<eos> - Blue velvet.<eos> -Thought it was a film.<eos> -We're doing the book version.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> Ah, Bettina.<eos> I said, what are you doing? .<eos> My man here lost his scan key..<eos> If you touch Clive again, somebody finishes you!<eos> Why are you telling me my business?<eos> Do I tell you yours?<eos> Do I say...<eos> A Chinese likes it this way, a Norwegian like that?<eos> No, I don't.
- So what?<eos> - Older people smell different.<eos> A sweet smell. It's a little like... Yes, kind like corpses.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Check once more these Per Gunnar "Gäddan" Gärdin and Hans "Hinken" Claesson.<eos> - But I'm busy with the 100-year-old.<eos> - It's the same biker gang: 'Never Again'.<eos> - Didn't you read the investigation?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Six months ago.<eos> On the SS "France".<eos> So you were still living in Boston in March of this year.<eos> Yes.<eos> Can you remember what you were doing on the 17th?<eos> The 17th of March?<eos> Oui.<eos> - How am I expected to remember that?<eos> - You do not recall this day?<eos> No. I don't.
I hope you've saved some money, 'cause you're gonna need every dime now.<eos> What's this?<eos> And with his newfound wealth,<eos> Michael was not only able to send his son off<eos> - Get out of here!<eos> - to a bright future in college, with the family car he was also able to finish the long-delayed housing development Sudden Valley, but this time, under his own company name.<eos> Maybe I can give you a tip. Might want to put a road up to this place.<eos> Well, we paved the neighborhood. Just waiting for the city to build a road to it.<eos> And although his mother's day in court was something both he and his college-bound son would miss, Michael truly felt that nothing could go wrong.<eos> And then something did.
My wife died years before any... any of this.<eos> Oh, gee.<eos> I think it's a lot more fun if we see her die.<eos> - That is fun.<eos> - And by the way, then it's a fantastic part for a leading lady.<eos> In fact, my girl Rebel would be great in that part.<eos> Your girl?<eos> Rebel Alley.<eos> She's an actress. You know her.<eos> NARRATOR: He didn't.

Might I suggest bringing in someone younger to play the father-- a Philip Seymour Hoffman type?<eos> A Philip Seymour Hoffman type.<eos> And so, naturally, I-I thought of you.<eos> Well, you know, I'm a married man, so I don't really keep a directory of attractive young actresses around.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I mean, are you really planning on using her, or is it like Conan with the girl writers?<eos> It doesn't matter, it...<eos> I-I'm here to talk to you about a movie that we're gonna make about the family, and I thought that it might be really fun for us to work together again.<eos> Help me remember.<eos> What did we do together?
- Love you, too.<eos> Bye. Cash, no receipt.<eos> - Hot day, Father. - Hot day, Father B.<eos> - Hot day.<eos> - Hot day, Father.<eos> Hello, Father.<eos> Don't call me that!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - You and Mom talked about it.<eos> - We did...?
Fine, I'll get her up against the top of the staircar.<eos> I don't care, it's gonna happen, though.<eos> I am talking about Herbert Love.<eos> - Is he going to oppose the building of the wall? - Oh, yes.<eos> I took care of that.<eos> He is going to announce that in his speech tonight.<eos> That is great news.<eos> Listen, I-I-I have to go.<eos> I have to see if I can pass this testosterone test.<eos> I do, too.
Let me run the clock down on this thing.<eos> Why don't you just go change into something a little less... unflattering, and...<eos> I'll, uh... And he was getting everyone in the mood for romance.<eos> Guess I'll take my clothes off.<eos> While Ann less-unflattered herself up, Gob had an unexpected visitor--<eos> Ann's ex-boyfriend George Michael, who, as it turned out, hadn't completely let go of the relationship.<eos> You're lucky that I'm chasing after our girlfriend, or I'd have to flatten you!<eos> Whew! Way to plant, Ann.<eos> You told me George Michael knew about us.<eos> Well, he does now, my darling plant.
That's better than what I had, actually. I was gonna say they'd be covered in ink and glitter.<eos> Or we can support Lucille 2, who he's running against.<eos> She's right across the hall.<eos> No, no!<eos> She's part of the problem.<eos> Wait, you haven't been going over there, by the way?<eos> - No one can know we're here.<eos> - Of course not.<eos> Does it look like I'm lying?<eos> It did.
- Yeah, she goes on trips a lot for work.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> For what?<eos> She has a chain of student tutoring centers.<eos> And you're at Indian Hills?<eos> I know.<eos> Exemplary student, right?<eos> So, what do your parents do?<eos> Well, my mom doesn't work, and my dad works for a film distribution company. Hmm.<eos> Yeah, they do a lot of work overseas and stuff, so-
Sorry.<eos> I don't do well with small spaces.<eos> You been here long?<eos> When I was a kid and I was acting up, my mother used to tease me and she used to threaten me saying she'd send me to Hecuba Prison.<eos> Now I'm here, and she won't even open my letters.<eos> Well, I barely know my mom.<eos> Though this one time she did sleep with my boyfriend, then try to kill me.<eos> Don't you have any kin waiting for you on the outside?<eos> I've got friends that are more than family.<eos> At least I did ... before this.
She is.<eos> She's a doll.<eos> Anyways, I asked them, I said, "Girls, what's so funny?"<eos> And Diane said to me,<eos> "Why, Daddy, Mary Poppins."<eos> I didn't even know what a Mary Poppins was.<eos> But then she gave me one of your books, and, oh, by gosh, my imagination caught on fire.<eos> Absolutely on fire.<eos> And those embers have burned ever since, as you know.<eos> I do.
Raise them high.<eos> Do you want to die a terrible death?<eos> Only by your hands.<eos> You smell good.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's my lip gloss. Do you want some?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> I want to be in love.<eos> No, you don't.

Ah, m'grandson. Isn't it?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Nothing half so much worth doing as simply messing about with guns.<eos> Strewth!<eos> You certainly know my size, dear, don't you?<eos> I generally park here.<eos> Julia has written to me.<eos> Our sister.<eos> She asks if I approve of the decision she outlined in the previous letter.<eos> Ah, do you?
Who is that extraordinary person and why is she inciting my butler to wiggle like a jelly?<eos> Not bad.<eos> Of course, Aunt Connie's chin is even pointier.<eos> My room?<eos> Show me anything you like, dear.<eos> Oh... it's perfectly simple.<eos> She's a hoofer at The Pussy.<eos> But Georgia is not the issue.<eos> How does my grandson fit into this?<eos> He doesn't.
- That's not very encouraging for you now, is it?<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> Come with me, please.<eos> Love you-- bye.<eos> - Hi-- it's your dad. - Hi.<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> - She-she's still there.<eos> - What-- you didn't go in with her?<eos> - To a psychiatrist appointment?<eos> No-- no, i didn't.
People keep asking me that, you know?<eos> My aunty just died.<eos> I really liked her. I grew up with her.<eos> I think it's...<eos> I think it's pretty obvious how I'm feeling.<eos> OK.<eos> I haven't cried yet.<eos> I just...<eos> I just don't know how to get the momentum up.<eos> I did at my granddad's funeral.
There's nothing to see.<eos> But where is she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Come on.<eos> Story time.<eos> I really want to see.<eos> Let's have a story, naughty, naughty.<eos> What if they don't find her?<eos> They'll find her.<eos> Yeah, but what if they don't?
Just nothing.<eos> A blip.<eos> People will have seen it.<eos> You just need one person to call and it could make a difference.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mummy?<eos> Yeah?<eos> We saw Hattie on May Day.<eos> No, we didn't.<eos> I did.
No, we didn't.<eos> I did.<eos> She went past on the road when we were going to cross.<eos> No, no...<eos> I'd have... I'd have remembered if we saw her.<eos> But we did see her!<eos> Look, I know you want to find Hattie, but saying you saw something when you didn't see it, it... it just doesn't help anyone.<eos> I DID see her.<eos> Look, you didn't see her.<eos> I did!
Nah, something's happened.<eos> What's happened?<eos> Nothing fucking happened.<eos> What about the pub?<eos> - What happened in the pub? Did...<eos> - Nothing happened in the pub.<eos> Did you say something to them?<eos> Nothing happened in the pub, all right?<eos> Leave it.<eos> - Well, clearly something did.
Don't think. You shoot. You understand?<eos> Ah, I forgot... these packages came for you.<eos> Oh, there's a letter too.<eos> I got it!<eos> I got the money!<eos> I think they'd think it was fas...<eos> I think it's fascinating. So I know they would.<eos> - Aunty Robbie!<eos> - Aunty Rob! We came to say goodbye!<eos> How you doing?
You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.<eos> What are you trying to say about Morty?<eos> That he's stupid or something?<eos> Oh, don't high-road us, dad.<eos> You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.<eos> I-I-I don't know what you mean by that.<eos> Can can can you be a little bit more specific?<eos> Oh, for crying out he's got some kind of disability or something.<eos> Is that what you want us to say?<eos> I do?
$25 million.<eos> - That's $25 million? - Give or take a couple of 'em.<eos> Of a million?<eos> Watch out. There's a camera right there.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, so after they're done upstairs we drop it in here, it piles up until it's full.<eos> Half the time the drivers don't even bring it upstairs first.<eos> So how do they know how much is in there?<eos> They don't.

Lady Sansa.<eos> Ser Loras.<eos> My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the Lady Olenna in the gardens.<eos> May I escort you to them?<eos> I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa.<eos> You are too kind, Ser Loras.<eos> You probably don't remember the first time we met.<eos> At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor.<eos> A rose, a red rose.<eos> Of course I did.
What's he telling him?<eos> Why don't you ask?<eos> Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?<eos> Where's the shame in that?<eos> Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.<eos> Some people will always need help.<eos> That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.<eos> When my father died, I dreamt it.<eos> You didn't dream it. You saw it.<eos> So did I.
About a week, I think.<eos> You think?<eos> You don't know?<eos> When we went to Castle Black, we took the King's Road.<eos> You and your roads.<eos> Is that how you lot do your fighting?<eos> You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?<eos> Most of the time, yes.<eos> How do the men holding the banners fight?<eos> They don't, really.
Where the battles were fought, the heroes, who died where.<eos> Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed.<eos> The seventh will be the same.<eos> Mance is different.<eos> You don't have the discipline.<eos> You don't have the training.<eos> Your army is no army.<eos> You don't know how to fight together.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
Tools.<eos> Now.<eos> And if they're ruined, you're going to work the whole set off this summer.<eos> I mean it. A paper route.<eos> Big Chief Indian Corn.<eos> Goddamn Ohio Soccer Jazz.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You have your pick.<eos> This bullshit ends today.<eos> Yes, it does.
The blacks of Europe.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Period. - That's powerful stuff. - That's not...<eos> Okay, wow.<eos> Sweetheart, I'm Irish, okay?<eos> We're under a lot of stress, Captain.<eos> I'm sorry about...<eos> You know Patrick was our only boy.<eos> - "Is." - Did you know that?<eos> - Yes, I do.
You won't miss the wedding, though, will you?<eos> When is it, exactly?<eos> Two weeks from Saturday.<eos> - Two weeks Saturday?<eos> - You'll be there, won't you?<eos> Please.<eos> Fancy a drink?<eos> Now?<eos> - Can I come in or was I...<eos> - No, please do.
Yeah, that works better, thanks.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - That's ok.<eos> That was hard, huh?<eos> You wanna stay later and work on it together?<eos> You wanna try that again?<eos> From here?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Come on, you like it.<eos> No, I don't.
The car he was overtaking was doing 110.<eos> Comeon, 110...<eos> Yes ma'am, do you want to compare the statements?<eos> The witness wrote 110, so if he was doing 110 - -then how fast was Mr. Barbu going?<eos> He can write whatever he wants. It's his signature.<eos> No ma'am, this is a farce.<eos> He can't write 110 when he was doing 160.<eos> You write what I tell you.<eos> If you're honest, you stand a chance in court. If you lie like this and write 110 like she says, you're not doing yourself any favors.<eos> Just do it.
Contact the expert, Guta will do it.<eos> 3. Perhaps the most important.<eos> The parents must withdraw their formal complaint.<eos> Perhaps we can pay for the funeral. As a first step.<eos> The mother should be contacted first.<eos> Not just now.<eos> Give them a bit of space, you know.<eos> Right.<eos> Talk to Erdogan, make sure the blood test is ready by 11.<eos> I did.
I love you.<eos> - Have the best last day, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> 'Bye,guys.<eos> -Bye, Daddy.<eos> - Love you. - And you read the street signs, okay? Don't let Bean.<eos> My God, riding their bikes to school.<eos> Couldn't do that in L.A. with the nuts out there.<eos> Yeah, 'cause thank God there's no crazy people out here.<eos> How you doing, Nick?
- lt is me, yes.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - l'm in Marseilles.<eos> I'm getting a ship to America. Oh.<eos> What are you going to do there? - Start a new band?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> There's a lot of competition.<eos> - l just didn't think that...<eos> - You'd ever hear from me?<eos> No, I didn't.
It'll be good.<eos> Mmm. I've never been to a ranch before.<eos> Really?<eos> We don't have them on the East Coast.<eos> Right.<eos> How long have you been in Texas? Four years.<eos> You've never been to a ranch?<eos> No one I know has one.<eos> Wow.<eos> Lucky for you, I do.
Do you know the old Romany superstition, Clara?<eos> That the eye of a dead person retains an image of the last thing it sees?<eos> Nonsense, of course.<eos> Unless the chemical composition of the body has been massively corrupted.<eos> Wow.<eos> This is nasty.<eos> An organic poison.<eos> A sort of venom.<eos> And you think it's connected to Sweetville?<eos> I do.
What's there to celebrate?<eos> Joan, come on. I said I was sorry.<eos> What else can I do?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Mom wouldn't have missed it.<eos> You know, when she died,<eos> I didn't think I was gonna lose both of you.<eos> Did you do this?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Oh, hey. Uh, how you doing?
I'm a proud Calpine employee.<eos> I think they treat me more fair than I should be treated.<eos> If you have a company that is dependent on shareholders, there is growing and growing pressure on that company to show better and better profits and have higher and higher share prices.<eos> That's just the way capitalism is.<eos> That's not bad.<eos> But what that means inevitably is that there's greater and greater pressure to push wages and benefits down to the minimum.<eos> So you're a capitalist. I'm a capitalist.<eos> I say for these people making their millions, that's fantastic.<eos> I could have done the same thing if I went to school and had the brains for it.<eos> I do not.
What?<eos> Just for a while, just until Daniel gets used to all the changes and everything.<eos> She wants us to call her Janet for a while.<eos> I can't imagine what she's going through, right now.<eos> Don't assume it's all good.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Sheriff still believes he was in on it.<eos> A lot of people do.<eos> Well, you don't think that, do you, that he could've done somethin' that horrible to her?<eos> Well, I sure did.
Karen, it's not that simple.<eos> Well, then you should've told me, instead of making me sneak around and lie to him and to everybody.<eos> I... I thought you were more of a man.<eos> I thought you both were.<eos> Hey.<eos> This is not what it looks like.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You all just happened to be in the same bar at the same time?<eos> I thought about inviting you.<eos> I really did.
No, there's no need.<eos> No, I do.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> I thought you and my daughter were together. But it wasn't you I saw.<eos> Good luck with the show.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> I took the liberty of ordering your usual.<eos> You remember from 15 years ago?<eos> You do.
Oh, no problem, Mr. Wills.<eos> Okay, Richard Francis is gonna be at our stumble-through at 6:00.<eos> So I want as much of this new material in the run as possible.<eos> Ana, do you want to get over there so we can hear the new songs, please?<eos> Have fun.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Wow. Really?<eos> You liked it that much?<eos> Oh, not just us. Everybody did.
Some union rule he broke, someone he forgot to pay.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Press clippings from carousel.<eos> [Laughs] That was the first show I did with your dad.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> He saved a picture of the two of you in front of the marquee.<eos> Oh. You really loved him, didn't you?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> - He loved you too.<eos> - Yeah, he still does.
Great news, he really loves the LED screens.<eos> When you're ready, we'll be doing Voice in a Dream, all right?<eos> There's no new story here, Eileen.<eos> Producer and director at odds, last-minute changes, it's all been said.<eos> Then say it a new way!<eos> I mean, I need the press, Richard.<eos> You could talk about how you got your show back.<eos> Well, that might be a very interesting story, but it involves my daughter, and I'm not about to drag her through this.<eos> That's too bad. Mother and daughter banding together to save a show, people eat that stuff up.<eos> They do, don't they?
You know, it gets pretty dark after that.<eos> There's all these other characters too.<eos> So it'sa star is born plus Hamlet with a bit of Romeo and Juliet.<eos> Moulin Rouge, Gaga, J.T. Leroy...<eos> Or none of those things. It...<eos> You like it.<eos> It feels quite current.<eos> I think Hit list might be quite a good title, don't you?<eos> Well, I'm warning you... Just... everybody dies in the end.<eos> No, they don't.
Is that her?<eos> The woman twice dead, and her final message.<eos> He has withdrawn to this place of peace and solitude that he might divine her meaning.<eos> If he truly is mad, then this is his madness.<eos> Angie, is the internet working?<eos> Trying to phone the helpline, they won't answer.<eos> It's working for me.<eos> Can I use it when you're finished?<eos> More than one person can use the internet at a time, Clara.<eos> You done your homework?
They're notoriously difficult to navigate. Okay.<eos> Yes, generations of naive tourists, crypt raiders and drunken university students got lost down there, permanently.<eos> We don't have time to get lost. Time is running out.<eos> For the research that we're doing.<eos> Pete, we have Baudin's map.<eos> You do?<eos> We do? Well, the place that we work for, does.<eos> Nicolas Baudin, he was a French explorer.<eos> Most people don't know that he charted the French catacombs before he left on his famous Australian expedition.<eos> No, most people don't.
Yo, not gonna lie.<eos> - This sound... gets me hard as a fucking rock.<eos> But I don't like to go too fast right off the bat.<eos> I'd rather work my way into it, nice and easy.<eos> So I'll start off with some stills.<eos> Then, once I'm getting into it, I start looking for a video.<eos> I never actually touch my cock till I find the right clip.<eos> Then, once I do goodbye
Then, once I do goodbye<eos> For the next few minutes, all the bullshit fades away, and the only thing in the world is those tits that ass the blowjob, the cowboy, the doggy, the moneyshot, and that's it.<eos> I don't gotta do anything. I just fucking lose myself.<eos> There's only a few things I really care about in life.<eos> My body my pad my ride my family...<eos> Amen.<eos> ...my church...<eos> - ...my boys my girls and my porn.<eos> I know that last one sounds weird, but I'm just being honest.<eos> Nothing else does it for me the same way. Not even real pussy.
If you don't like that, there's something wrong with you.<eos> I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it's not a dime.<eos> - That's incorrect.<eos> - She's taller than you anyway.<eos> - Fuck you, Jonny.<eos> - I'm playing, come on.<eos> You gonna get that?<eos> Let me get a vodka-cranberry.<eos> Jonny!<eos> - Sammy-boy, how you doing?
- Jon!<eos> - Fuck You!<eos> - Fuck me?<eos> Did you just say fuck me to me?<eos> - Jon!<eos> He said they're in love, they're in love. It doesn't matter how old they are.<eos> He's older than you were when we got married.<eos> You know that? For God's sake, he's your son!<eos> You love this girl?<eos> Yes, I do.
You're probably right.<eos> It is pretty boring, don't you think?<eos> What?<eos> I said this class is pretty fucking boring. Oh.<eos> Yep.<eos> Like they're teaching you to be a robot.<eos> - Why are you here?<eos> -Hm?<eos> - Why did you pick this class?<eos> - I didn't.
- I didn't.<eos> What?<eos> No, it seemed like a good idea.<eos> I'm in the service industry now.<eos> - You mean you're a waiter?<eos> - No.<eos> - Bartender?<eos> - you gotta go to school. - Right.<eos> But what do you mean you didn't pick this class?<eos> - No, I did.
And especially Aunty Nica.<eos> What about Chucky?<eos> He says there is no God.<eos> Who said that?<eos> Chucky did.<eos> He said that life's a bitch and then you die, bleeding like a stuck pig.<eos> Alice.<eos> You know it's not nice to curse.<eos> I don't curse, Mommy.<eos> Chucky did.
Lunch?<eos> Really?<eos> - With Wonderboy?<eos> - Sometimes.<eos> Sometimes other things.<eos> Other things, huh?<eos> I didn't...<eos> He's married now, you know?<eos> Just in case he didn't mention it.<eos> He did.
And that there was nobody more important, more beautiful... or worth spending my time with.<eos> I knew that I loved you.<eos> And it's taken me a long time to get there.<eos> And that's why I've come here. To get down on one knee and to tell you how much I love you.<eos> It's been four years, though.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> Do you?<eos> Okay, just so you do.<eos> I do.
No.<eos> But Luke can.<eos> I called him today.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What did he say?<eos> Oh, you know, that he'd do anything for me, and that he loves me, and that he wants me back, you know.<eos> All the usual stuff.<eos> I can't remember the last time Hardy said those things to me.<eos> Come on, Hardy loves you.<eos> Of course he does.
I mean, I heard rumors on the street that their earnings were bogus, but I didn't know.<eos> After I started working there for a while, making some serious money, I found out.<eos> But they didn't know that I knew.<eos> Most of us junior guys, we got fleeced for a major buy-in.<eos> And they kept us legit.<eos> I never had a client who's money went into that fund.<eos> Everything was always legal.<eos> I went out of my way to make sure it stayed that way.<eos> But you knew, didn't you?<eos> - I did.
♪ Darling why do you look so sad, ♪<eos> ♪ Come home to me, ♪ ♪ when the world has been unkind ♪ You're a good dancer.<eos> For a Chinese guy?<eos> No for an American.<eos> My mom taught me.<eos> She worked in a cabaret in Shanghai's international settlement.<eos> And the Japanese...<eos> what do they do?<eos> You don't want to know...<eos> Yes I do. please.
- Jesus, are you- are you okay?<eos> - Ey... yeah.<eos> This... yeah, yeah. W - I was just, um...<eos> I should probably go... tell em.<eos> - Yeah, it's probably a- probably a good idea.<eos> - Uh, the pizza place has a bathroom next door.<eos> - No, it's fine, I just wanted to wash my hands.<eos> - Oh, cool. The sink still works.<eos> - Actually I do have to go... I just said I didn't cuz I don't like guys to know that pee comes out of me.<eos> But it does... all the time...
I was gonna tell you.<eos> I mean, obviously, I was gonna tell you.<eos> I just didn't... I didn't know what... I didn't know what to say.<eos> How about, "hey, Dermot, I'm pregnant. "<eos> Well, y-y-yeah, but...<eos> But what?<eos> But... you... oh, you want to keep it?<eos> No, actually.<eos> I...<eos> I don't.
You know how badly I want to believe that?<eos> Because I've been with you a long time and nothing ever gets better.<eos> Honey, you're...<eos> You're such a great guy but you always screw things up and let people down.<eos> Billy, I love you, but I'm tired of being let down.<eos> That's terrible, Nicky.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I should have gone on my own when I had the chance.<eos> Stupid!<eos> You did the right thing.
No one believed in the welder girl, but she believed in herself.<eos> Are you talking about "Flashdance"?<eos> You're damn right I am!<eos> The deck was stacked against Alex.<eos> You know how she overcame it?<eos> By believing in herself and trying.<eos> She literally had to become a maniac!<eos> Have any of you been called a maniac because you were different?<eos> My morn calls me a maniac when I tell her I love her.<eos> Of course she does!
- Hey, not be cool?<eos> - What's that?<eos> Kimberly's parents have this really cool lake house and... she thought it we would be totally cool if we gotta this weekend.<eos> Trish will be there too... so... won't it just be the coolest?<eos> Yeah... just... just keep the baby's bottom up while you wipe...<eos> - Russell, please.<eos> - ... near 3... 4... wipes...<eos> - You!<eos> - What's? ... - Why don't you wanna go?<eos> - I just don't.
Yeah, I guess they are.<eos> So the other ones there belong to the truck driver.<eos> Why isn't this crime scene locked off?<eos> I didn't think we'd worry about it out here, Jay.<eos> It's the middle of nowhere.<eos> So, you know her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She's a local girl.<eos> I'll send a car out, then, eh? Nah.<eos> I better do it myself.
One misstep leads to another.<eos> They poisoned the pious.<eos> Oh, God have mercy on the believers.<eos> We just bought Florence more time. Mm.<eos> What is it?<eos> The rider brought word.<eos> Your brother let slip how many guns we have.<eos> Production continues, but...<eos> Giuliano could've hidden his error, but he admitted it.<eos> For all the good that does us.
- Moses the physic.<eos> Understandable.<eos> Illness respects no curfew.<eos> That leaves Gemini.<eos> Who is he?<eos> I don't think our conspirator is Gemini.<eos> That's the symbol for, well...<eos> Lucrezia Donati?<eos> Forgive any indelicacy, but you surely know why she's out late at night.<eos> I do.
I don't want to be with you. You do.<eos> We laid right there on that bed a month ago and you told me if you ever broke up with me that I shouldn't let you.<eos> Because you were just being crazy.<eos> And how every guy you ever loved was gay.<eos> And how I was the only one that made you feel anything.<eos> Don't get up, Adam.<eos> Don't get up.<eos> And you said that I made you feel like your whole body was a clit.<eos> - I never said that.<eos> - Yes, you did.

Who did this to you?<eos> Rosita.<eos> They took her.<eos> Promise me you're going to find her, please. Find her for me!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> This isn't a secure line.<eos> I need to know his location.<eos> - We don't have it.<eos> - That's bullshit.<eos> We don't.
Warn them it has mescaline.<eos> Tell Alex that I did not take anything and I feel sick.<eos> How late we arrive in Mexico?<eos> We don't land in Mexico.<eos> Do not tell me that with the hangover we are in the wrong plane.<eos> Listen...<eos> We just got married, and we celebrated 3 days and we have come directly here.<eos> The hangover has nothing to do.<eos> This was suppose to go to Mexico.<eos> And now it does not?
Oh, and here we are, lost, certain to die.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Sit down and shut up.<eos> You sound like The Sly One.<eos> Perhaps you are the god of mischief who sends men mad and sends them to their deaths.<eos> Sit down!<eos> I curse the day I ever agreed to come with you, Ragnar Lothbrok. For this ship is cursed, and we are...<eos> Release the ravens.<eos> If the birds do not return, there is land.<eos> But if they do...
Midgardsormen, the world's serpent, will come lunging from the ocean, dragging the tides in and flooding the world.<eos> The wolf, giant Fenrir, will break his invisible chains.<eos> The skies will open, and Surt, the fire-giant, will come flaming across the bridge to destroy the gods.<eos> Odin will ride out of the gates of Valhalla to do battle for a last time against the wolf.<eos> Thor will kill the serpent but die from its venom.<eos> Surt will spread fire across the earth.<eos> At last, Fenrir will swallow the sun.<eos> No!<eos> So where did these Northmen come ashore?<eos> They didn't.
Hey, kiddo.<eos> Would you take your brother downstairs? I'll be there in a second.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye, Dad.<eos> Bye.<eos> Where they going?<eos> I'm taking them to their grandmother's.<eos> I was able to get ahold of Madeleine, and I told her... Fuck.<eos> You didn't tell her?<eos> No, I didn't.
And what's stopping you?<eos> Might be fun.<eos> You don't have to play now, you know.<eos> - You want me to stop?<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> You were invited as a guest, weren't you?<eos> You don't need to play for your supper.<eos> You're saying they didn't expect any music?<eos> Well, maybe a little, yes!<eos> Of course they did.
It's good, yes.<eos> I know you think there's something wrong with all of this, with Mr Masterson's hospitality.<eos> - Did I say anything?<eos> - You didn't have to.<eos> But maybe he really means it - it's not just a rich man's whim.<eos> And he won't move on to something else next week?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> - He really loves your music.<eos> - Really?<eos> He does?
No disturbances?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - All right, thank you, ma'am.<eos> So, you're a psychiatrist.<eos> You state the obvious.<eos> Does that mean you're naturally curious<eos> - about everyone? - No.<eos> Not that I want you to analyze me.<eos> I don't, but, uh...
- Tell 'em put a rush on the medics.<eos> 10-4, standing by.<eos> All right, which one, which one would he choose?<eos> This one says the breed is a Doberman.<eos> I'm him, I'm not light bulbing the owner of a loyal attack dog.<eos> This is a Poodle, needs to be walked during the night, but the owner works nights.<eos> - No one home to kill.<eos> - This one.<eos> How do we know for sure?<eos> We don't.
Your partner, does she trust you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I... I get the feeling from her that, yeah, I... I think she does.<eos> One more time, Aiden:<eos> Do you reciprocate that trust, even though you feel like you don't know her very well?<eos> Do you trust her?<eos> Do you trust her?<eos> Daniella, this is for his own good.<eos> Come on, you get that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
My wolf did terrible things because I had terrible things done to me.<eos> Everything I stood there and took couldn't wait to come out.<eos> You don't wanna think that I'm like her, but I am.<eos> There's no good answer.<eos> No... but she's turning tomorrow, no matter what.<eos> And we're running out of time.<eos> If we don't help her, then what else is there?<eos> What, you wanna put her down?<eos> - You actually thought about it!<eos> - I didn't.
I came here to help Sally, you guys.<eos> Go find Donna.<eos> Go!<eos> I figured you'd bring the other one, hence the dog at the door.<eos> But a vampire too?<eos> You might wanna take a closer look at that unsavoury circle.<eos> Well, clearly, she'd be better off palling around with a necromancer.<eos> I wasn't talking to you.<eos> I think I have the right to know now, what you have planned for me, for my soul.<eos> No, actually, you don't!
Whoever this is has nothing to do with any of this, okay?<eos> Let's hope you're right.<eos> There's no one here.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Sorry about this!<eos> That smile on your face is slightly disconcerting.<eos> Come on. We gotta find John before it's too late.<eos> - You got my list?<eos> - What list? Where's John?<eos> What did you do to him?
Oh my god.<eos> You look terrible. What happened to your shirt?<eos> Well, I got good news and bad news.<eos> The bad news is I got lit on fire and that nice shirt you bought me is ruined. Okay.<eos> What's the good news?<eos> I also got bear sprayed, nailed in the head twice and knocked unconscious.<eos> And I also hit Jake in the head with a frying pan.<eos> You didn't tell him about Crocker though, did you?<eos> No Tinny, no!<eos> I didn't!

So... don't lose hope.<eos> I'm trying not to.<eos> It's just ah... not having the power to fix this -- it's really doing my head in.<eos> I can't believe Carlotta let this happen.<eos> Why are you so focused on blaming your wife?<eos> She uh...<eos> Carlotta's not the woman that I married.<eos> Or maybe she always was that woman and I was just too blind to see it.<eos> Care to elaborate?<eos> No I don't.
- You're an idiot.<eos> I know.<eos> - You're new in town. - How can you tell?<eos> I'm proud to be your sister.<eos> You two are sisters?<eos> Now you cut that man down!<eos> I've decided to pardon Elah Bandik of all violations of Castithan law.<eos> Shtako!<eos> - You know who we work for?<eos> - I do.
- They need physical-- - Prayer. Prayer.<eos> Sure. Prayer, prayer, prayer.<eos> Passion. Passion. We need passione.<eos> You know, if the blinds are drawn, you know, you got to pull the shade up.<eos> Are you talking about a psychiatrist?<eos> Psychiatrist, psychologist. Uh, podiatrist.<eos> You know.<eos> A massage therapist.<eos> Some people do yoga. Do you know such a person?<eos> I do, as a matter of fact.
No. No.<eos> How long do you have?<eos> An hour.<eos> An hour and a half.<eos> You know, I didn't expect to see you again so soon.<eos> I had a doctor's appointment.<eos> You like to read? Mm-hmm.<eos> Have you read that one?<eos> I'm not supposed to.<eos> But you did, right?
But yöu have to promise not to get mad.<eos> Jill, are yöu kidding me?<eos> No, it's not... it's not bad.<eos> Okay, what?<eos> It's not... no.<eos> I just feel like...<eos> Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> If we want to get married...<eos> Which we do.
At least we're the assholes that you know.<eos> You need a drink?<eos> Let's get you a drink.<eos> I'll come.<eos> Do you have a lighter?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> No. I hate it here.<eos> I hate my life.<eos> I did too.

Power line for the park.<eos> What'd happen if we dropped the end into the moat and turned it on?<eos> Fry anything that entered the water.<eos> Can Cybermen fly?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> First good news of the day.<eos> Do it.<eos> Stop that!<eos> I felt that.<eos> Of course you did.
I'll talk to him.<eos> I know I promised to respect whatever decision you made, but I must ask you to reconsider.<eos> Show these men and my brother mercy.<eos> Very well.<eos> I'll change their punishment.<eos> Your lives will be spared.<eos> But you will live them out in prison.<eos> Thank you, Uncle.<eos> You like that, don't you, blueberry spicehead?<eos> Yes, you do.
Oh, yeah, man.<eos> He is a charmer, I got to tell you that.<eos> Been putting the wood to your girlfriend Andrea.<eos> - Big time, baby.<eos> Andrea's in Woodbury?<eos> Right next to the Governor.<eos> I told you to drop that!<eos> You know Andrea?<eos> Hey, do you know Andrea?<eos> Yep, she does.
I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to choose somebody.<eos> - Listen...<eos> I'm done putting all my energies into this project.<eos> - Guys...<eos> I'm done just putting all my energies into you, so choose one, choose now,<eos> I cannot compete, I am not built for this shit, so please, just choose somebody!<eos> Serge, I...<eos> I'm sorry, you don't have a choice.<eos> I have a boyfriend.<eos> Of course, you fucking do.
A lot of men have it.<eos> Not me, of course.<eos> I'm a very virile man.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> Super virile.<eos> - Very virile.<eos> I don't know you well enough for this to feel comfortable with me.<eos> Bobby, thank you so much for this delicious food.<eos> If you want, I can set up an examination.<eos> - I don't.
Please, just do what I said.<eos> Just go down to the basement and lock the door.<eos> - Just lock the door.<eos> - It's cluttered down there.<eos> I wouldn't go there.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Shit!<eos> - Oh, my God! What is that?<eos> - Go now!<eos> Do it!
I have never cut my hair.<eos> I am forbidden.<eos> It's a sign of my devotion.<eos> - If I cut my hair, I...<eos> - What, my love?<eos> What if you cut your hair?<eos> My God will take away all my strength.<eos> I'll be as weak as everyone else.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> No, Samson, I do.
- Majesty.<eos> David.<eos> Is there news of my husband?<eos> No.<eos> No, nothing like that.<eos> He's safe enough, I believe.<eos> Although he is far away.<eos> Fighting the enemy.<eos> But you didn't go?<eos> No need, not with men like Uriah to do it for me.
Take one step in the wrong place, dead in two seconds.<eos> Getting back to the structure, um, we thought...<eos> I like it.<eos> I'm looking for something bold, exciting, capture the imagination.<eos> Yeah, Melbourne, it's boring.<eos> It's like having sex with your wife.<eos> Well, not yours.<eos> "The wife," "our wives."<eos> We, um, appreciate that you like the concept, and...<eos> Yeah, the inverted pyramid, I do.
Perhaps one day, you'll learn to talk to me.<eos> I'll see you upstairs.<eos> Sit with me?<eos> Before we got married... I was in love with someone.<eos> Someone totally wrong.<eos> It was over by the time we got together.<eos> I didn't want it to be.<eos> Do you still love her?<eos> No.<eos> Do you?
It's not all like that part.<eos> It's wonderful writing.<eos> Do women really have such thoughts?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> With me?<eos> Is that wrong?<eos> No.<eos> You do too?
Sun...<eos> What's your name?<eos> My name's Emma.<eos> What do you do?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Hairdresser?<eos> Fourth year of Fine Arts.<eos> Fine Arts?<eos> You like it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- You got me. I'm really sorry.<eos> Honestly, I just got frightened, I guess.<eos> I saw a face and I lashed out.<eos> You're frightened of a black man. Just say...<eos> I don't think so. I don't think I was frightened of the black man.<eos> No.<eos> It could've been any black person standing there.<eos> It could've been a black old lady saying, "Hey, surprise."<eos> Are you gonna punch her in the fucking nose?<eos> - I don't... - A little kid? A dwarf, a black dwarf?
Doubt you made a friend there.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's William.<eos> He's engaged.<eos> * When the moon hits your eye<eos> You're in love.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll be careful.<eos> You said you didn't mind getting your insulin now I'm doing it.<eos> I don't.
Sister.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> Running behind is all I am.<eos> Colin, you haven't taken your sample yet.<eos> Go on. In you get. Eve, his hand print is still on your face.<eos> Was a misunderstanding is all.<eos> It's a pretty big one.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Honest. I don't know what got into him.<eos> I do.
And what's that got to do with me?<eos> It's just before Poppy Day.<eos> And the timing stinks.<eos> Everyone knows that you have more reason to hold a grudge than any local, so your involvement would go a long way to silencing the 'anti' sentiment.<eos> I know I'm asking a lot.<eos> You have no bloody idea, George!<eos> Jack...<eos> Forget me.<eos> They killed your wife.<eos> Yes, they did.
Who told her about the date?<eos> - She did.<eos> - I had no idea. - Well...<eos> - No, you did.<eos> The wheels just came off the evening.<eos> Who's to say who said what?<eos> I can't believe you told her I was getting a boyfriend.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I didn't.
'Every single time.'<eos> And you were never scared again?<eos> Oh, I was scared lots of times.<eos> But never of being lost.<eos> So, this special song.<eos> What are you scared of, exactly?<eos> Getting it wrong.<eos> Making Grandfather angry.<eos> And do you think you'll get it wrong?<eos> Because I don't.
- He's not?<eos> We're going out tonight.<eos> Want to come?<eos> Oh come on!<eos> You going to drag me around like a seeing-eye dog?<eos> I'm stuck here!<eos> My parents got me an assistant to help me with my "daily life."<eos> - What daily life?<eos> I have no life.<eos> - Of course you do!
Are you worried that the horizontal structure is gonna give power to people who shouldn't have it?<eos> You mean Joel and John?<eos> Shelly, you started off with one clear and not unreasonable demand, and now you've got, like, 14 of them, including arresting Bear Stearns and the Lehman Brothers.<eos> You doing a story or giving advice?<eos> I haven't been assigned the story, so I'm giving advice.<eos> And you can't have a protest unless the media's covering it.<eos> The media is gonna cover it.<eos> But they're gonna cover the drum circles and crunchy, uninformed college kids yelling at the earners, who, coincidently, are the same guys running Time Warner News Corp.<eos> You don't have the patience for complicated things.<eos> I do.
- Oh, my gosh.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Stay! Apparently our siblings don't get along.<eos> The only reason yours is still alive is out of courtesy to you.<eos> Put the gun down right now.<eos> Listen to your sister.<eos> This ain't none of your business, fanger.<eos> What'd you just call me, Jason Stackhouse?<eos> He's been out of his mind all night. He doesn't know what he's saying.<eos> Like hell I don't!
No, I did not.<eos> When you summoned me, Bill, you almost tore me apart.<eos> - I promise you, I won't--<eos> I want you to hear me.<eos> Because when we left you at the Authority, that was not Bill Compton that we were leaving.<eos> You were a fuckin' monster.<eos> And when your pull led me here, I had no idea what I was gonna find. I had no idea what I was walking into and I still don't.<eos> Now may I talk?<eos> - If you have answers.<eos> - I don't, Jess.
You know, you cheating on me with Jennifer.<eos> She was cute and sexy.<eos> And once you laid your eyes on her, it was impossible for you to resist.<eos> But I have a way to make that never happen for us again.<eos> You have wandering eyes, Kevin, and that's not good for our relationship, baby.<eos> Haven't you done enough?<eos> All right?<eos> Come on.<eos> I learned my lesson.<eos> Just please don't.
Just please don't.<eos> I gave you the image of the sexy underwear.<eos> Don't take my eyes.<eos> Now I'm just going to take your wandering eyes away.<eos> - No, please.<eos> - Just be quiet now.<eos> - Shh. - Not my eyes.<eos> Just please don't take... please.<eos> Don't, don't.<eos> Don't, please.
Can I touch you?<eos> How long have you been doing this?<eos> A while.<eos> I like working for The Girl.<eos> She's super great.<eos> I'm paying my way through school.<eos> Who's The Girl?<eos> Oh, um, she's dating Justin.<eos> And, uh, why does she not have a name?<eos> She does.
- The Pussy Den...<eos> - Huh? - Clit Cat, Clit Club...<eos> - What?<eos> - What was it called? It was ridiculous.<eos> As if anybody wants to admit that they actually went to Limelight every single Saturday night.<eos> - Sure, sure. - Limelight was so...<eos> I remember Kenny K at the door. - Yes. - Right?<eos> If you didn't have the right shoes on, he wouldn't let you in.<eos> I learned to give the best blow jobs in the bathroom at that place.<eos> She did.
Am I not doing it right?<eos> Well, it's just not you.<eos> I am 42.<eos> So?<eos> Something has to be me by now.<eos> I think you should tell Kate.<eos> She was just here.<eos> So...<eos> If she wanted to know, it's all right here.<eos> She doesn't.
What do you think about the metamorphosis?<eos> Pretty chic, huh?<eos> Love is a game changer.<eos> Is she still hung up on Ricky?<eos> Good one.<eos> Although I wonder if Ricky has anything to do with why Tamara and Jake aren't online official.<eos> But any day now. Right?<eos> Right.<eos> I knew that.<eos> But I didn't.
But not you, Shawn.<eos> There is nothing more dangerous than having an investigator who is emotionally involved.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> How about a raccoon with a discarded malaria sample?<eos> And I'd be crazy to tell you to go after Jerry Carp.<eos> - Yeah, I know that, chief.<eos> See, I would be absolutely crazy to tell you, the closest thing that we have to a sure thing, to go out there and find this dirty son of a bitch.<eos> What are you saying, chief?<eos> You are not to go after Carp... and we never had this conversation.<eos> We did.
He doesn't know that you're my dad.<eos> Must be your mother's handiwork then.<eos> Yeah. Could be.<eos> Well, I can't say I blame her.<eos> She's a smart cookie, your mother.<eos> She always was. Just like you.<eos> I would say that, um. I've started to enjoy us getting to know each other. Getting to know you.<eos> When I see you are a nice, beautiful, good person. I'm very proud of you.<eos> Not that that should mean anything to you.<eos> It does.
Talk about your personal life.<eos> Listeners love that stuff. Yeah. Yeah, what Syd said.<eos> Expose myself. Open up.<eos> Welcome back, Santa Barbara, you guessed it.<eos> Hey, Gus, how do you feel about your girlfriend heading back to the UK for six months?<eos> What? Rachael's heading overseas?<eos> Juliet told me.<eos> I assumed you already knew.<eos> Juliet knows?<eos> And now so does all of Santa Barbara!
- Dad! - Spencer, calm down.<eos> - Yeah, seriously, dad.<eos> Why do you wanna sound off alarm bells before Gus and I have had a chance to investigate this murder?<eos> That's what we do.<eos> That's what you used to do.<eos> Have a little Spencer faith.<eos> You're floundering, Shawn.<eos> You don't even have a suspect.<eos> I fantasize about killing that man every day.<eos> Oh, yes, we do.
Satan wants to talk to you.<eos> Where is she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll be in the car.<eos> You hear stories trickling down the mountain... of people up here following their own sort of laws.<eos> Old laws.<eos> You know?<eos> The kind where blood gets shed when they're broke.<eos> Cops don't even come up here, let alone a city girl poking around, asking questions.<eos> How you doing?
You're a Southern boy, aren't ya?<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Louisiana.<eos> - New Orleans.<eos> - New Orleans. Whoo!<eos> Devil sure runs wild down there, don't he?<eos> Think I even ran with him a time or two.<eos> You don't seem surprised.<eos> I think I got you pretty well figured out.<eos> You do, huh?
Wayne, what did Billy say?<eos> Wayne, what did Billy say?<eos> Look, I know that I lied, but... I was desperate, okay?<eos> I fucked up.<eos> What'd he say about Liz?<eos> You know you can't trust them.<eos> Wayne!<eos> The Lord knows what we're doing up on this mountain.<eos> - He knows!<eos> - Yeah, he does.
We live and die by one accord.<eos> By accepting Billy as her husband,<eos> Rachel joins this accord.<eos> She is now one of us.<eos> Till death do her part.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Please take Rachel's right hand.<eos> Brother Billy, do you desire to be united in marriage to Rachel, to love her as Christ commands... so long as you both shall live?<eos> I do.

No, no, no, you don't.<eos> Yeah, I think maybe I do.<eos> Skyler, understand, I am here to help you.<eos> But to do that, I need your help.<eos> We start bringing in lawyers and they start putting up roadblocks where they don't need to be and my ability to control this situation diminishes.<eos> Just for my own protection, and just... You know, it seems to make sense that I should have someone to talk to.<eos> Skyler, I'm your biggest advocate here, and I'm telling you, for your own good, you need to get out ahead of this thing.<eos> I mean, you start, you know, getting defensive-- I'm not saying it's right, but I'll tell you it's a fact, the DA will look at you differently.<eos> But you don't know that.<eos> Skyler, yes, I do.
This is not my country.<eos> I failed.<eos> You cannot fail.<eos> You are as strong as Stalin.<eos> No!<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Even stronger.<eos> You are as strong as God.<eos> God does not exist!<eos> Yes He does.
Enough now!<eos> We won't wait any longer!<eos> Come out right away, or we'll burn your shop!<eos> They're surrendering.<eos> We are alive, comrades.<eos> - Death to Ibáñez!<eos> - Death!<eos> Here it is, comrades!<eos> Hallelujah, I found it!<eos> - No, I did!
Maybe you should.<eos> You handle big stuff, citywide stuff, extra jurisdictional.<eos> Exactly.<eos> How about something I don't know?<eos> Have either of you ever heard of Ari Sonnenland?<eos> I have.<eos> He's a developer, a big one.<eos> Sunny Meadows Complex in Elizabeth, New Jersey, the Sterling Tower in the Navy Yards, and his brother is a beekeeper.<eos> I have no idea how I know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Did I?<eos> So just take the damn job.<eos> Besides, those two like working with you.<eos> And that is a first.<eos> What about Webster?<eos> Really?<eos> Fine, but if she calls me Ellie again, I'm-I'm gonna ship her off to Ronkonkoma... wherever the hell that is.<eos> Look, I know I've been acting like this is some kind of dream job, but if it's not your dream...<eos> I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but... I want to stay.<eos> You do?
- l forgot to give him the message!<eos> - What about Julian?<eos> I have to do this. I said I would.<eos> I won't be a moment.<eos> Julian, I have a message for you from Mr Masterson.<eos> - When did he give it to you?<eos> - Tonight.<eos> He says everything is taken care of.<eos> I think that's what he said.<eos> He did, did he?
You're here, splendid!<eos> Stanley?<eos> Word in private.<eos> Will here do?<eos> This is perfect.<eos> Nathan told me that when you played here on Christmas Day, some Germans from the embassy walked out as soon as you came on.<eos> Yes, but that was to be expected, wasn't it?<eos> What do you mean, that was to be expected?<eos> Does nothing make you angry, Louis?<eos> ! Well, of course it does.
One of these?<eos> Stanley thinks this too - they wanted Jessie all to themselves.<eos> People become so obsessed with their favourite performers, they want power over them, to own them.<eos> Yes, but I never saw any of them inside the hotel, ever.<eos> They could have got in.<eos> I haven't told anybody what you've told me, I promise, but it can't have been Julian, I really believe it can't have been.<eos> I did see him that night inside the hotel.<eos> There'll be an explanation for that, there really will!<eos> Anyway, we don't need to think about that now.<eos> No, we don't.
- Impressive.<eos> - Thanks, I guess.<eos> We have a situation, a bad situation.<eos> - You mean with the spy?<eos> - You know about it?<eos> There isn't a soul in Charleston that doesn't.<eos> And, frankly, people are pretty upset about it.<eos> Well, I've been tasked with the job of investigating the mole, and, frankly, I could use someone with experience.<eos> I'm not sure if busting a couple of small-time drug dealers qualifies me for espionage work, Dr. Manchester. Besides, how do you know I'm not the spy?<eos> Well, I don't, actually.
I lay down on the bed. I just laid there.<eos> I think I went to sleep.<eos> What the...?<eos> I had bruises all over my neck and marks from my fingernails where I'd tried to get his hands away from my throat.<eos> I was hoarse for days.<eos> I couldn't swallow.<eos> Did you meet with him again?<eos> Just once.<eos> Did he apologise?<eos> Yes, he did.
You're insane!<eos> You have to stop this insanity!<eos> I'll stop once you tell me where they are.<eos> No!<eos> Are you going to help me with him?<eos> Are you from his department?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I'm from Internal Affairs.<eos> I hope you put an end to this saga.<eos> So do I.
Are you going to tell me where you buried my granddaughter's head?<eos> I really don't know.<eos> No!<eos> - You smell that, Gidin'ka?<eos> - It smells like a barbecue.<eos> You have no idea how much I've missed that smell.<eos> His mom turned me into a vegetarian because of my high cholesterol.<eos> Oh, I could go on all night! Gidin'ka... I remember you loved hot dogs as a kid.<eos> - Do you still like hot dogs?<eos> - Who doesn't?
Well, just tell that to my parole officer.<eos> Isn't that... ?<eos> His name is Jordan.<eos> He's Rebecca's stepson.<eos> And your new BFF?<eos> Guys don't have BFFs.<eos> I'm just fixing his bike.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I thought you said you and Ethan broke up.<eos> I did, didn't I?
Do you think it's okay if I get a couple more things?<eos> Uh, sure.<eos> You know, it's like we always say around here...<eos> If you have an employee discount, make "dis" count.<eos> Great.<eos> I wrote it all down.<eos> Whoa. This is some list... that continues on the back.<eos> How are you gonna carry all this?<eos> Didn't you say employees get free delivery?<eos> Yes, I did.
[ Sighs ] Hey, Molly. It's Milo.<eos> Uh, Milo!<eos> No, no, everything's fine.<eos> Huh? Yeah, yeah, I can hear.<eos> It's loud. Okay, uh, just...<eos> Just give me... Yeah, call... call me whenever.<eos> So, she's out at a club.<eos> Sounded crowded.<eos> A lot of people go to clubs. We almost went to a club.<eos> But we didn't.
My sister's kid, Donald, is coming to town, and Uncle Gibbs wants to go big.<eos> Didn't we agree no more referring to yourself as "Uncle Gibbs"?<eos> That doesn't like something Uncle Gibbs would agree to.<eos> What brings Donald to New York?<eos> He's in town for his med-school interview at Columbia.<eos> [ Voice breaking ] He's such a smart little dude.<eos> So he wants to go to Columbia?<eos> It's between there and Harvard, so he's gonna visit both to see which city he likes more.<eos> Doesn't your brother live in Boston?<eos> He does.
Tyler, I don't have time for this, okay?<eos> So on the count of three, we both take off our shirts.<eos> Deal.<eos> Fine.<eos> 1, 2, 3.<eos> - I'm not gonna do it.<eos> Look, I'm not wearing the vest.<eos> I'm not wearing the vest.<eos> Okay, well, if neither of us has it...<eos> Then who does?
Come on in. Adam...<eos> - You know Lydia Hye?<eos> - Hi.<eos> Hi, Lydia Hye.<eos> Lydia is the smartest kid at west hill.<eos> She's graduating high school with... wh...uh, what is it?<eos> An associate's degree from Normandale Community College. I take online courses from there.<eos> That's how good she is.<eos> I mean, who thinks of that?<eos> She did. Lydia did.
What was he thinking?<eos> Just give me one second.<eos> There's a deli. Down the street.<eos> Patti, thanks for coming.<eos> Sit down.<eos> You want some coffee?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Hey, did you see bill Maher last night?<eos> No, I didn't.
We're aiming for the $200-million mark.<eos> We got a lot of work to do.<eos> We do, but you can start with the congressman whose districts fall within the watershed.<eos> Do you have a draft of the bill you can show me?<eos> We haven't sponsored any environmental legislation.<eos> We'll draft it in consultation with your staff.<eos> Gillian will be the point person on our end.<eos> I don't have any legislation experience. - I'll help you.<eos> - When do we start?<eos> We just did.
Randy?<eos> It's a risk, but it'll make waves.<eos> Free coverage across the board.<eos> The narrative has to be redemption, a phoenix from the ashes.<eos> Well, let's not focus on the ashes. We don't want people to think Peter was a disaster.<eos> No, no. We focus on the positive.<eos> A "fresh start" and a "clean start" both did well in focus groups.<eos> "Clean start" sounds too much like "clean slate." I like "fresh start."<eos> Yeah, I do too.<eos> How we doing on the fundraising?
OK.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I think you got it.<eos> Do you know "grace"?<eos> She a new friend at school?<eos> The new vocab word from class.<eos> "Grace." Yeah, that's a good one.<eos> I think Mom had that<eos> Yeah, you got a good memory, Maddy.<eos> She did.
You've got to put that behind you.<eos> You've got to move forward. You've got to think about Amanda.<eos> You've got a baby coming.<eos> You've got to suck it up.<eos> You've got to man up.<eos> You've got to pull your shit together.<eos> Here's how this is going to play out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Suspect is leaving the port of entry.<eos> How you doing?
For God's sake, bring them to the Embassy!<eos> Risk a diplomatic confrontation with the Soviets?<eos> Paris will want to handle this.<eos> Paris will get them soon enough.<eos> Find a private plane to get them there.<eos> We have to keep this to ourselves. We can't risk embarrassing the Poles.<eos> You shouldn't be running this alone.<eos> They came to me.<eos> They trust me.<eos> So did your Countess.
- Show me your hands, man.<eos> Come on, show me your hands.<eos> Maybe we're brothers.<eos> We're not...<eos> We're not brothers.<eos> We're not brothers.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Do you have a... Do you have a scar on your chest?<eos> This one?<eos> You do, don't you?
Ah, good work.<eos> Get your act together, lady.<eos> I got day-old chuck, two-day-old sirloin, couple of partially soft bagels, and, like, two gallons of nearly expired mayo.<eos> Oh, and a sheet cake.<eos> Joanie was late picking up her kid again.<eos> And guess what the excuse was.<eos> - Flat tire?<eos> - Flat tire.<eos> It's not the homo thing that gets me, 'cause gays hit on me all the time and it doesn't bother me.<eos> Of course they do.
What's wrong with Abaddonn?<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> No. I know. I just mean...<eos> really?<eos> It's a lot.<eos> There's just a lot, and I just didn't want you to think that I'd ever hide anything from you.<eos> You're my friend, and I need you to just please promise me you would never tell anyone this.<eos> Honestly, Amy, I have so much on my mind right now, I--<eos> I just hope you know what you're doing. I do.<eos> Like, I finally do.
Yeah.<eos> Cheers. There you go.<eos> See you later. Take care.<eos> That's how it is.<eos> Thought I told you to keep an eye on this veg!<eos> Nah, nah, today.<eos> Fucking useless.<eos> It's obviously a text from someone you don't know! Doesn't matter!<eos> It is someone that I know, he's a friend of mine.<eos> Well, it does because...!
Ow!<eos> Trace, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm going to go now, Carol. Go?<eos> Dinner's almost ready, babe.<eos> I thought you were here for the night, I've got drink and stuff.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I've got to do something for my mum.<eos> All right, love.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I really, really don't.
Come here.<eos> Tel, put the shopping away.<eos> Remember when you had 'em?<eos> Remember what you told me?<eos> The police ain't going to leave this.<eos> There was nothing on the geezer.<eos> They ain't got a clue who he is.<eos> No name, no nothing.<eos> They ain't come yet, they'll get bored sitting.<eos> What if they don't?
It is that.<eos> I see that girl and I can't help but think it could've been one of mine.<eos> Well, it could've been any of ours.<eos> I'll put you two together.<eos> That's all.<eos> Look, I don't know what it is with you and Dr. Pryce, but he is the closest available scientific authority.<eos> You really gonna make me ask Olivia...<eos> - You know what he did.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> None of us do.
You know others similar?<eos> What, in London this year?<eos> As many as there are pigeons shitting in Grosvenor Square.<eos> There's a, er, there's a man goes about with her.<eos> First I've seen of him.<eos> And she, Miss, er, Hart.<eos> You call her a businesswoman?<eos> Turn of phrase.<eos> Meaning?<eos> What it commonly does.
Which is why you find me here.<eos> I came to see exactly what it is brings you by.<eos> If there's a version of the future that includes you and yours heading home happy, well, that is me resting easy right here.<eos> We were friends once.<eos> Wouldn't mean anything we were still.<eos> Was she worth it?<eos> I told you. She moved on.<eos> You forget I was by your side the day you first saw her.<eos> You expect me to believe you'd lose such a prize?<eos> I do. Well, I don't.
I'm fine.<eos> It's just I'm really pissed at the crazy bitch.<eos> That tasing shit really fuckin' hurts.<eos> I know, right?<eos> This is my third time.<eos> Thanks for coming to get me, Runks.<eos> Of course.<eos> I got your text. I really freaked out.<eos> Well, I guess with all this time and all the punani in between, you still love me, huh?<eos> Yes, I do.
The nightmare.<eos> My brother and my friends are...<eos> Sir, I tried to save them and I couldn't.<eos> Oh, is that what happened?<eos> Sir, there is a monster.<eos> There is a giant fish.<eos> I heard about it when I was a kid, but nobody believed it.<eos> You kids, you don't believe anything anymore.<eos> Sir, I don't think you understand what I've been through.<eos> Oh, yeah, I do.
And...<eos> And?<eos> Watching my parents live out that gospel.<eos> You were on everyone's radar, and then you just disappeared.<eos> That all depends on whose radar.<eos> See, I played all through the mission fields.<eos> The thing is, Mr. Decker, you could throw a ball 100 miles an hour; you're going to get people's attention when you bring them something more powerful than that.<eos> Did you ever think of the platform you could have standing on the mound in Yankee stadium?<eos> Of course, all the time.<eos> I still do.
I'll try not to let it affect my work.<eos> But, what will you do?<eos> Swap them?<eos> No; anyway, we haven't got to that point yet.<eos> Raising them both could be a solution.<eos> Both of them?<eos> Yes, don't you like it?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Don't you want to meet our son?<eos> Of course I do.
I think we dodged that one.<eos> And Emma?<eos> Back at the cabin, I assume.<eos> But still in town.<eos> Thayer, too.<eos> What, are you thinking that Laurel's not the only reason they came back?<eos> Laurel followed you to my house.<eos> And I explained to everyone at the hospital her mad crush on Jordan.<eos> Yeah, but we'll never really know if they bought it.<eos> They did.
- Yes.<eos> We were both adopted.<eos> Born to different moms and dads, but raised by the same mom and dad.<eos> Could you stop doing that gun thing?<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Got migraine from the pressurized cabin.<eos> - Matthew.<eos> Did you like the new mom and dad?<eos> - Yes, of course--<eos> - Aunt Jasmine did.
Why don't you just go to decorator school?<eos> Well, I have to use my days to work and pay my way.<eos> As Hal said, "it's not the money, it's the money."<eos> Yeah, okay, but, you know, life ain't all work and no play, right?<eos> Ginger says between work and school, you're cracking up.<eos> - Hey, why don't you shut up?<eos> - No, no.<eos> I'll admit, it's been very trying but I'm determined to make something of myself.<eos> - You don't like working with the dentist?<eos> - No, I do not.
If you're prepared to work hard and not settle--<eos> - What, you mean Augie?<eos> - She means me.<eos> Who do I have to sleep with around here to get a Stoli martini with twist of lemon?<eos> That's what I...<eos> What--?<eos> What--?<eos> Oh, Christ, I can't remember.<eos> So, Chili was telling me that you used to have a really nice collection of cars.<eos> Oh, yes, my husband did.
They're in the building.<eos> We need to exfilt..<eos> I got this!<eos> Mr. President, Mr. President, I get you to the vault.. their game is over.<eos> You sure you can get me there?<eos> Yes, sir. I am.<eos> Then get me to the vault.<eos> Diamond formation. Stay low, stay close, shoot first. Got it?<eos> Do you have the vice president?<eos> Irepeat,do youhavethevicepresident?
We've a long trip ahead and need food that keeps.<eos> Where do you live when you're not travelling?<eos> Where work can be found.<eos> And you?<eos> For the last five years, in Chicago.<eos> I worked there as a maidservant.<eos> A maidservant?<eos> That seems unlike you.<eos> How's that?<eos> - It just does.
Just one time, tell me.<eos> Just come home.<eos> - I saw that!<eos> - Ho!<eos> Jesus.<eos> Oh, I think it's the pills.<eos> What pills?<eos> I probably shouldn't be drinking. I started taking these antidepressants.<eos> How many of these did you take?<eos> No more than you did.
Merry Christmas.<eos> Wow!<eos> Uh, yeah!<eos> What should we ask for next?<eos> A pony? Okay, so is he... richer than your parents? Or is it all sort of at the same level?<eos> Yeah, it's definitely not the same.<eos> And there are levels of richness.<eos> And rich people love to compare themselves to extra-rich people and claim poverty.<eos> He just looks so natural being rich.<eos> Doesn't he?
Your inability to see the obvious.<eos> - Your assistant has good taste.<eos> - I fired her months ago.<eos> She suggested blue, she had to go.<eos> It's nice.<eos> I can exchange it.<eos> No, I'll find someone to give it to.<eos> She may have something for him, too.<eos> She's just waiting to see if he deserves it.<eos> He doesn't.
I'll tell him you brought it.<eos> You know that I would never hurt him.<eos> Right?<eos> It's just us here.<eos> Come on, you know.<eos> - What do you want, Julia?<eos> - Just tell me that you know.<eos> You hate me, I cheated on you, but...<eos> - I don't care!<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Me?<eos> - Yes, you.<eos> No-ho-ho-ho.<eos> I'm ready to have sex now.<eos> - Yeah, I mean, I've just been thinking about it, and you've been really nice all week, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> I mean, we can do it, you know, if you want.<eos> No, I want to. I-<eos> - I didn't- but only if you--<eos> - No, I do.
- Yes, you.<eos> No-ho-ho-ho.<eos> I'm ready to have sex now.<eos> - Yeah, I mean, I've just been thinking about it, and you've been really nice all week, so...<eos> Okay.<eos> I mean, we can do it, you know, if you want.<eos> No, I want to. I-<eos> - I didn't- but only if you--<eos> - No, I do.<eos> Yeah, I do.
How is this of any importance to the US Fish and Wildlife Service?<eos> Johann, is there any chance any of your test animals could have gotten out, any of your human subjects?<eos> None whatsoever.<eos> And there I thought I'd cracked the case.<eos> You wouldn't happen to have any thoughts on our demon dog, would you?<eos> There is one thing, Doctor.<eos> Considering the parallels between the two killings,<eos> I'm convinced this was the premeditated act of a pathological sexual predator.<eos> Didn't you say you believed an animal was responsible?<eos> Yes, I did.
She stunk up the car.<eos> Kill me and... your dead wife won't forgive you.<eos> "Protecting people... "is your job."<eos> She... never said that.<eos> She was in a coma at the hospital.<eos> She never said a word.<eos> I made it all up in my head.<eos> I had to believe in that fairy-tale... or I wouldn't have survived.<eos> Did you hear we had a baby?<eos> We did... a girl inside her womb.
Hello?<eos> I want to go to the Moon.<eos> Me too. That'd be awesome.<eos> We got a 7:30 ice time.<eos> What are you doing up so early on a Sunday?<eos> Oh, it's these crazy shifts I'm working.<eos> - I've been up since 5:00.<eos> Yeah, I might as well just skip sleeping altogether.<eos> - Right?<eos> - How you doing, Henry?
I was just going to...<eos> You don't recognize me.<eos> Should I?<eos> The Anomaly Research Centre.<eos> I used to work with you.<eos> [Stammering] If you did, I...<eos> No, I don't remember.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Looks like you don't remember either.<eos> No, I don't.
Okay.<eos> We did it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And just in time.<eos> You got through this once already.<eos> And everything's going to happen the same way again.<eos> Right now.<eos> I guess this is what always happened, I just never knew about it.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Yeah, but it does.
I was 14, couldn't have weighed more than this jerk detective's beer gut.<eos> I just started wailing on him.<eos> That must have been quite the sight.<eos> The point is, I choose to believe that my father wouldn't do that.<eos> That he couldn't.<eos> Even though he wasn't there to tell me I was right.<eos> Skye, I wish I had your faith, really.<eos> But Nate...<eos> You say you don't know your brother, but you do.<eos> Deep down, you do.
Yeah, the teacher's this monk, or something.<eos> A monk? Yeah.<eos> Robert Palladino.<eos> He's totally inspiring.<eos> My name's Julie.<eos> Are you leaving?<eos> Yeah. I have to go.<eos> You want a hit?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm leaving, Steve.<eos> 0K3? '-<eos> No. No, Steve.<eos> I'm leaving Apple.<eos> For good.<eos> Actually, I already did.<eos> I thought I should come back and tell you first.<eos> Why?<eos> We both knew this was coming for some time.<eos> I don't even...
Mind your head.<eos> Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> I'm looking for Dina de Waal.<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> Don't know her.<eos> Are you Dina?<eos> - What do you want from her?<eos> It's about my brother, Ray Boelens.<eos> Dina said he was innocent.<eos> Did I'?
Of course I want to throw one.<eos> I love those little slimy bastards.<eos> They remind me of everybody who wants to take a piece out of me.<eos> Looks like somebody made a new friend.<eos> - Yeah, I did. - Well...<eos> Good.<eos> You want me to stay away.<eos> No. I want you to do whatever you want.<eos> God knows I do.<eos> You certainly do.
Come take a ride with me.<eos> Wilson.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Enjoy the ride, man.<eos> So neither of you guys are gonna tell me what the fuck we're doing?<eos> Get off the boat.<eos> Come on.<eos> Richie!<eos> How you doing, bud?
- Klara, go!<eos> - Bobo, let's go to my room.<eos> - It's your fault, Klara.<eos> - No.<eos> - Bobo?<eos> - I'm never going to get a guy.<eos> - Of course you will.<eos> - Everyone thinks I'm ugly and gross.<eos> - They don't think that.<eos> - Yes, Linus does.
And "technically" I'm not single...<eos> Don't worry, love, she's already dished about your little break-up.<eos> It's more of a break.<eos> I say, if it's getting hard, something's wrong. Hmm...<eos> I always say the opposite.<eos> If it's getting soft... am I right?<eos> I'm good at book club.<eos> Oh, we should totally set Bo up with Pete, the tennis pro?<eos> Yeah, if she likes 'em hairy and sweaty.<eos> Do you?
No, I grabbed these because I figured the could help.<eos> I just felt like I had to...<eos> Had to do something.<eos> Well, it looks like you guys were doing a whole lot of "something."<eos> Oh, this is where you tell us to back off, let you do your job?<eos> No, no, no. This is where I say, "I get it."<eos> When you lose someone that you love, the hardest thing is to do nothing.<eos> May I?<eos> Police have any new leads?<eos> Not as many as we do.
You look pretty.<eos> Must be all the oxygen.<eos> They say what's wrong with you?<eos> No. Just the fever.<eos> They're trying to find out what else.<eos> They won't find anything.<eos> They'll keep looking, keep taking tests, keep giving false diagnoses, bad meds, but they won't find out what's wrong.<eos> They'll just know that you're wrong.<eos> - I hope you have good insurance.<eos> - I do, too.
- Escorted by a detective.<eos> - Under false pretence!<eos> It is as good as permission.<eos> You lied to a police officer.<eos> You can't arrest me for lying.<eos> You got all that information from a local detective?<eos> Lots of talk about your man Graham.<eos> Not to mention the rivalry of who gets the collar.<eos> A local police detective looking for a pissing contest with the FBI might have some insight.<eos> - And evidently did.
He's accepting it or he's bargaining. Heh!<eos> Bargaining chips!<eos> Is he done making angels, or is he just getting started?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's not just killing them when he's sleepy. How's he choosing them?<eos> - I don't know, ask him.<eos> - I'm asking you.<eos> You're the head of the behavioural science unit. Why don't you come up with your own answers if you don't like mine?<eos> I did not hear that! Did I?<eos> No, you didn't.
No, it's on Jack Crawford's account.<eos> I don't want any information about Will that I shouldn't have as his friend.<eos> Did Jack ask you to profile the Ripper?<eos> Not since I consulted on the case with Miriam before she disappeared.<eos> - Crawford's trainee? - Yeah.<eos> Very sad.<eos> You had me examining PhD candidates that week.<eos> And I'm grateful you were examining PhD students and not the Ripper.<eos> You realise those candidates thought we were having an affair.<eos> - Why didn't we?
Stacey was there to pick up the pieces.<eos> I thought she was my... my second chance.<eos> But it was all lies... wasn't it?<eos> I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. Harrington.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Murphy.<eos> I have a feeling that our paths will cross again.<eos> Great work, Kate.<eos> You helped exonerate an innocent man and uncovered the true culprit.<eos> I really think that should become part of your campaign narrative.<eos> Oh, of course you do.
It's from Timmins P.D.<eos> Yeah?<eos> So?<eos> - So what are you gonna do?<eos> - Well, I... guess I'm gonna open it.<eos> When?<eos> I... I'm just trying to figure out next month.<eos> I mean, should I be looking for a roommate?<eos> Chris, I love you, man.<eos> I do.
What?<eos> Damn! Get out!<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Get out, you idiots!<eos> Go away!<eos> You are free!<eos> - I don't understand you anymore.<eos> - What's wrong with your mind?<eos> - You don't have to talk to me like this.<eos> - Yes we do!
That's fine by me.<eos> Good. 'Cause, you know,<eos> Emma's in a real fragile place right now. She doesn't really... she doesn't really want a lot of people in her hair.<eos> - Trust me, I'm not in her hair.<eos> - Okay. I just hope it doesn't bother you knowing that she trusts me instead of you.<eos> So that's what this is about?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you're not bothered, right?<eos> Just forget I mentioned it.<eos> Oh, but you did.
No one has given me any money.<eos> Really?<eos> You know, 'cause I can't help notice you got a really nice outfit there.<eos> Manny the man here might be your friend, but I'm not.<eos> I'll be watching you.<eos> Well, I'll try to give y'all something good to look at.<eos> Hey.<eos> Travis, what's wrong?<eos> Samantha's mom told me I couldn't go to the pizza party.<eos> Oh, she did, did she?
Philadelphia outbound train 437 to Harrisburg and Points West will be departing in five minutes.<eos> Olivia.<eos> How do I know it's you?<eos> We used to dream of traveling together to the opposite end of the earth so that Ian could have the day and... I could spend the whole night with you.<eos> We never did, did we?<eos> No, we--we never did.<eos> I told you I didn't want to see you again.<eos> You're not safe.<eos> Is that supposed to scare me?<eos> Because it doesn't.
Hi. It's Spencer.<eos> Um, how much more "encouragement" do you need?<eos> Five hundred...<eos> Cash.<eos> Fine.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> You're looking at about a hundred years' worth of stuff.<eos> Did you grow up here, Mr. Doyle?<eos> Jamie.<eos> Yeah, I did.
For God's sake, Emily, to hell with them.<eos> I can't say that!<eos> You can!<eos> - I'm not like you.<eos> - No, say it right now.<eos> To hell with them. Go ahead.<eos> Hear yourself say it.<eos> To hell with them.<eos> Say it because they don't matter!<eos> They don't.
To hell with them. Go ahead.<eos> Hear yourself say it.<eos> To hell with them.<eos> Say it because they don't matter!<eos> They don't.<eos> None of them!<eos> The work matters!<eos> It matters to get the work right and to get it right now, and that's all that matters, because that's what lasts, and you think you have all the time you need to learn and grow and create?<eos> You think you have all that time? You don't!<eos> Nobody does!
I didn't want you to know that.<eos> Why?<eos> You're not that kind of girl.<eos> One who likes to have a good time?<eos> No wonder you'd rather hang out with Donna.<eos> I'd rather hang with you.<eos> But I'm grounded.<eos> I'm not fun.<eos> I'm not gonna lie and say I don't like to party.<eos> I do.
I don't know. Maybe you're not the jealous type.<eos> I wanted to believe that I was in love with you in the way that it matters.<eos> But the longer I stood here, I realized I wasn't.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I think we should break up.<eos> Um, d-did I do something? Because I can change.<eos> We can make it work.<eos> It's not you.<eos> You're perfect. Then why don't you love me?<eos> Mags, I do.
Come on.<eos> You loved it.<eos> I so did not even.<eos> What do you mean? I saw you laughing in the dark.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I was laughing at you laughing.<eos> Oh, sure, OK.<eos> Well, why on earth<eos> - did you pick it? - I did not pick it!<eos> You did.
They said you got put up at the big jail one time.<eos> - Coleman told you that?<eos> Yeah, I have.<eos> I did 29 months in the penitentiary for assault on a police officer.<eos> They pulled me over behind a shopping center uptown.<eos> This one officer... some pretty-boy type guy...<eos> had some issue with me. He thought I had something to do with one of the girls he knew.<eos> I didn't know what the hell he was talking about.<eos> Then they tried to shoot me after I beat the shit out of all three of them.<eos> Or one did.
Should have been me.<eos> Do you know where they took her?<eos> Gary... tell me.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I just need the truck... to get me someplace.<eos> I'm gonna make trouble.<eos> Meet me outside.<eos> $30.<eos> $30 each.<eos> How you doing?
Are you still feeling pain here?<eos> Just as long as we're on the subject, we need to discuss the matter of my niece's pregnancy.<eos> Certainly.<eos> She will require the best treatment.<eos> Only the best for family.<eos> That's it.<eos> Follow the light.<eos> Did you have a place in mind?<eos> You do realize we do not have an obstetrics wing here.<eos> You do now.
These... What...<eos> And I'm totally confused.<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Maybe you could help me out. - Oh, sure.<eos> You a big runner?<eos> I just like to run after work.<eos> - Yeah. I run.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> Yeah. You ever run a marathon? No.<eos> I did a 10K once.
You brought this on yourself, you know.<eos> Is this how you roll now?<eos> Tough love?<eos> You handcuffed the Morrigan to her bed for a Kodak moment.<eos> You sure this has nothing to do with your Fae United Nations experiment?<eos> A Light cop partnered with a Dark cop?<eos> Really?<eos> It's cynicism like that has kept our sides from building a genuine peace.<eos> Also, why do you care who Dyson is paired with?<eos> - I don't.
Let me introduce you.<eos> My sister's husband.<eos> The cuckolded?<eos> He's also staying a few days.<eos> Great, a pianist?<eos> You could play, I sing!<eos> I don't accompany.<eos> Put the piano over there.<eos> - Who told her?<eos> - I didn't.
My sister's husband.<eos> The cuckolded?<eos> He's also staying a few days.<eos> Great, a pianist?<eos> You could play, I sing!<eos> I don't accompany.<eos> Put the piano over there.<eos> - Who told her?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - I certainly didn't!
You shot me.<eos> Why'd you shoot me?<eos> I've never even seen you.<eos> No, sir.<eos> What is this about, the money?<eos> It's about you, you and the girl.<eos> Everything you tried to do.<eos> You gonna shoot me?<eos> I don't want you to think I owe you anything.<eos> No, you don't.
Oh, well.<eos> Hey there. What a surprise.<eos> Yeah!<eos> How are you? So good. I'm so good.<eos> Yeah, how you doing?<eos> I'm never been better.<eos> Yeah.<eos> 'Cause you look so good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So do you.
Do a lot of people do this?<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> Alex, right?<eos> It's Cassandra.<eos> I've seen you somewhere before, haven't I?<eos> At another one of Liza's parties.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't-- I don't remember. Sorry.<eos> I do.
Why are you in a tuxedo?<eos> Because tonight is formal.<eos> I thought it was cocktail.<eos> It was cocktail last year.<eos> Yeah, but you know my mother.<eos> She likes to up the ante.<eos> This year--Formal.<eos> Did I not say that? No.<eos> No.<eos> You didn't.
Uh, nothing.<eos> I saved you a seat.<eos> Hope you're happy.<eos> About what?<eos> Like you don't know.<eos> This is our place.<eos> We've been coming here since we were kids.<eos> This is Carrie's safe place.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> She sure did.
No. What's tragic is someone who can't be alone.<eos> I don't have that problem.<eos> Me, either, but I'm me.<eos> I'm always the best thing in the room.<eos> Without a hot guy like Walt, you're just positively average.<eos> When you see me on the dance floor, you will take that back. Oh.<eos> That's so pathetic.<eos> I can already see you dancing with your sad little girlfriends.<eos> I know they won't have dates either.<eos> Actually, they do.
OR MOVE OR GET KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL OR--<eos> WOW.<eos> YOU THINK A LOT. COMING FROM THE GIRL WHO NEVER STOPS THINKING.<eos> YEAH. ABOUT MY GRADES AND HOW I HAVE TO DESTROY THAT IDIOT JOCK WEST.<eos> MOUSE, HE SOLVED A RUBIK'S CUBE ONCE.<eos> THAT'S NO BIG DEAL.<eos> IT IA BIG DEAL.<eos> BEING ABLE TO SOLVE A RUBIK'S CUBE DIRECTLY CORRELATES TO SPATIAL INTELLIGENCE, WHICH MEANS THAT IDIOT JOCK MIGHT ACTUALLY BE SMART.<eos> SO WHO CARES?<eos> I DO.
We met at your Halloween party. I had a Halloween party?<eos> Anyway, about your journal...<eos> You could have a best-seller on your hands.<eos> And here is the man that you need to meet... Tripp Ramsey.<eos> He's Bret's publisher.<eos> He's always on the lookout for a fresh, new voice.<eos> Well, I'll be very friendly when I take his name at the door and hope he remembers me five years from now.<eos> Why would you be working the door?<eos> Because you told me I had to?<eos> I did no such thing.
The question is, what are you going to do now?<eos> Eat a grilled cheese.<eos> Don't be obtuse.<eos> I mean with Carrie.<eos> You do like her, right?<eos> I know you like her.<eos> Say it.<eos> Say it.<eos> Say it.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Get over there.<eos> What... what... what do I say?<eos> First, hello.<eos> Then, everything else.<eos> (Whispers) Okay.<eos> Go, go, go, go, go!<eos> Go, go! Go, go!<eos> I could've sworn he played for my team.<eos> Don't fret, darling.<eos> At some point, they all do.
Well, good for you.<eos> So what have you been up to besides missing me like crazy? Ah, not much.<eos> My mom split again.<eos> She's back with Lucas.<eos> I think my parents are done for good this time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Although that's what you wanted, right?<eos> (Mouth full) Yeah.<eos> It's better this way, believe me.<eos> I do.
Well, now i can't say it because you're just gonna think I'm saying it because i have to.<eos> Why do you have to think so much about everything?<eos> Because that's who i am, and obviously you don't like that or the choices i make or what's important to me,<eos> So if that's the way you feel, then maybe we should just break up.<eos> Once again, i had lost control of my mouth.<eos> I could only hope Sebastian was in control of his.<eos> Well, if that's what you want, fine.<eos> It's always about what you want, anyway.<eos> I never even told him i love him, Mouse.<eos> And i do... so much.
Forget good.<eos> You... look positively radiant.<eos> I mean, for someone with colon cancer, you look practically well.<eos> I want what you're having.<eos> I do feel pretty chipper.<eos> I'm really glad, Dr. Sherman.<eos> I want at least one of us to make it, and since you are the cancer doctor,<eos> I think it's only fair that you be the one to stick around.<eos> Just try and... just cure this shit, once and for all.<eos> How you doing?
But if I have to stay here and wait for God to decide when he's ready to let me go, why does it have to be so painful?<eos> Your illness is not just to test you, but to test the charity of others.<eos> Have you seen generosity and kindness in the people around you?<eos> Well, we believe that beauty and the knowledge of that goodness is Allah.<eos> We believe it's God.<eos> We're not sure.<eos> Oh, lord Jesus Christ, most merciful lord of earth, we ask that you receive this child into your arms, that she may pass in safety from this crisis.<eos> As thou hast told us with infinite compassion, let not your heart be troubled.<eos> Ye believe in God, believe also in me.<eos> How you doing, Adam?
Really appreciate it.<eos> Yeah. A little serendipity.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> We were open and you were passing by.<eos> That was like...beautiful, affirming, warming.<eos> Like heaven.<eos> Totally, like, almost tearful.<eos> I want to do more.<eos> I don't know what that means, but you know what I mean, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Thank you<eos> Sit down, sit down You'll give us a toe neck<eos> Big Billy... he was the worst beggar Hold on a minute<eos> Have a red one, they're good<eos> Thank you, I haven't eaten<eos> He weren't one you see The punters felt it, they never stopped<eos> It was Lesley who got him the drink He would have been sober without her<eos> Lesley? We were all mad for her, I was<eos> But out the crew she picked Billy The only one who didn't pester her<eos> I didn't You did!
And he knew...<eos> If he confessed to me all about little Christina in a confession, same as I confided in him, he knew I would never break the Seal of Confession.<eos> But you have just told me everything.<eos> - I did. In a confession.<eos> It still remains secrecy.<eos> What are you going to do with it?<eos> Thanks to our Holy Sacrament, it will all remain between us.<eos> And... the police?<eos> They found nothing?<eos> They did.
Now, how many of those pills did you take?<eos> How many?<eos> - No more than you did.
And the town.<eos> Do you see them now?<eos> You're looking for them.<eos> I'm waiting.<eos> For what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something.<eos> There's an answer.<eos> I know it doesn't make sense.<eos> Well, it does.
Did you ever imagine we'd both end up as neurosurgeons back then?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I always wanted this... as long as I can remember.<eos> Ah, usual departmental B.S.<eos> But overall, no complaints.<eos> You know, I worked with a guy who did a spinal fellowship there a few years ago.<eos> Jason Cole.<eos> You know him?<eos> Of course I know him.<eos> Everybody did.
- Not since The Wire.<eos> Okay, gimme a level.<eos> It's a pleasure doing business with you.<eos> We're not trying to play to the balcony. Just talk normal.<eos> Pleasure doing business with you.<eos> - I assume that's our bust line.<eos> - Yeah. Start hiring writers.<eos> So I'm in the middle of breakfast this morning, and I get a call from FBI ops asking why they haven't been informed that we're running a reverse on a Vzakonye dealer.<eos> Imagine my surprise since I didn't know we had a Vzakonye dealer.<eos> We don't.
We wanted to catch you before work, save you the embarrassment there.<eos> - Thought we were done with all that.<eos> - All what, Sarah?<eos> The abduction and rape of a little girl?<eos> Is that the "all that" you're talking about?<eos> This is Detective Melic, new bloke.<eos> - So, Victor been round? - No.<eos> I'm over with him.<eos> Well, we know he comes around. - He doesn't.<eos> Bullshit, he does.
Jake, what are you doing?<eos> !<eos> Are you really standing up in front of everyone and singing to prove your love for Marley?<eos> Yes, Ryder.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Wow.<eos> That's so crazy and emotionally vulnerable.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
She constantly mumbled to herself and she stuffed used Kleenex up her sleeves.<eos> We all were convinced that she was crazy.<eos> But you know what?<eos> That's why we loved her... because we were crazy, too.<eos> This is the room that always felt like home.<eos> Maybe because we knew Lillian Adler loved music almost as much as she loved us.<eos> And that's how I feel about you.<eos> Every one of you.<eos> And-and I'm sorry if I made any of you feel like you don't have a voice in this room.<eos> You do.
- Yes.<eos> My foster mother.<eos> - Good.<eos> Hi, Jack's mother.<eos> You can never remember my name.<eos> No, no.<eos> I can.<eos> It's Mrs. Stone.<eos> I just wanted to drop off Jack's laundry.<eos> My mom usually does his laundry.
Can I come with you?<eos> Yeah, if you want.<eos> She might not want to come back with him.<eos> Why did she cry at the restaurant?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> I called Shahryar.<eos> He said she burst into tears. She's never this late.<eos> What did you tell her?<eos> You hadn't told her you were pregnant?<eos> You did?
- Where are you going?<eos> I do not know, run from the police.<eos> - What?<eos> Give me the phone.<eos> - We made robbery.<eos> Give me the phone.<eos> - We have a mountain of gold.<eos> Give me the phone.<eos> - Give your father.<eos> Hi, Sylvia, how you doing?
And the eyesight issue. He wouldn't be up to the task<eos> I haven't told them about that yet<eos> Why?<eos> Naoko's request<eos> She said she wants to gauge their reaction when we meet<eos> We're not going to cancel<eos> It's clear to me I'm sure that really you want to meet this person<eos> Kentaro! If you let this chance slip away... you won't find another beauty like her<eos> Please cut it out!<eos> I don't do marriage interviews
He's a junior research fellow at the Department of Psychology.<eos> He's a scientist. He investigates systems of belief, why people believe.<eos> Could it have been part of his research?<eos> Well, he never mentioned it.<eos> Then again, he was hardly home.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> One of his clients found him.<eos> She knew him as Randolph James.<eos> It just gets worse.<eos> What does?
A-Any time if... you think there's anything I can do to help in any way.<eos> You must miss the boys a lot and... ..well...<eos> There you go, wild youth.<eos> And wild lass. Great, Dad.<eos> More jobs like this, I can stop doing Mr Miller's funerals.<eos> Don't turn your nose up at funerals.<eos> We all die.<eos> Good steady income.<eos> Morbid.<eos> And you... do some studying.
Best before the 15th?<eos> That was when?<eos> Last week.<eos> You're a single bloke. Zap it in the microwave.<eos> You know Jack Cornish well?<eos> I worked with him for three years.<eos> Well, the big gossip - that even I can't avoid - is he's having an affair with Tara Faulkner.<eos> Peter Faulkner's wife?<eos> Pretty solid. Everyone knows.<eos> Jack's wife doesn't.
Aliens, no need to gas us, we're on your side.<eos> One time we're gonna get gassed and not wake up.<eos> If we die, I just don't wanna die alone.<eos> That's why you got me.<eos> Let's get married... right now.<eos> It's too sad.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I'll record it... and we can still have a wedding video.<eos> So... in case we miss our future wedding, do you, Jessica Marino, take me, Dave Roberts, to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.

You and Roslyn.<eos> I can't imagine what that must have been like.<eos> I never told anyone what we went through.<eos> We woke up one morning... and all of the grown-ups were gone.<eos> How many kids were there?<eos> 20 to start.<eos> It was such fun at first.<eos> We played all day.<eos> We thought for sure the grown-ups would come back.<eos> But they didn't.
Not entirely original, but sophisticated enough that we weren't able to identify it out of any standing database.<eos> Well, so can you help her?<eos> We're starting a counteragent protocol that should abrogate the drug's effects.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> The rest, of course, is up to her.<eos> Why are you fighting?<eos> You already know.<eos> This... all of this is a part of me that wants to stop looking for my dad.<eos> So you do want to move on.<eos> No, I don't.
Sure. Of course.<eos> You look like him.<eos> The eyes.<eos> It's funny.<eos> Well, not funny, but...<eos> I didn't know he had a brother.<eos> Of course. Francis.<eos> He runs the farm, since my husband passed.<eos> So...<eos> What do you do?
Strange thing to say with him gone!<eos> It's Sarah, our lovely Sarah.<eos> - What the fuck is this?<eos> - Oh, come on!<eos> Your brother's girlfriend!<eos> Silly me.<eos> Francis smokes these on special occasions.<eos> But he'll share, won't he?<eos> And you can smoke inside.<eos> My husband did from '71 to 2001, so the smell...
There's a body involved.<eos> Gotta liaise with Homicide.<eos> - You read my file.<eos> - I also visited your family.<eos> - You spoke to Arun?<eos> - He wouldn't speak with me.<eos> - He's young.<eos> - He's angry.<eos> What does Arun say about you coming home?<eos> He doesn't... I don't...
- He's young.<eos> - He's angry.<eos> What does Arun say about you coming home?<eos> He doesn't... I don't...<eos> - I can't hear you, Mandar.<eos> - He doesn't want me to come home.<eos> But he will change his mind.<eos> Does Ria want you to come home?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, she does.
She's just being supportive.<eos> Maybe everyone secretly wants a G.B.F.,<eos> Even moms.<eos> Right now I would just settle for, like, a B.F.<eos> You mean like a best friend or, like, boyfriend?<eos> Either/or... or both.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my god, no, no. Did we...?<eos> We didn't, right?
Why did you do such a thing?<eos> Because they left me out!<eos> Because they made fun of me!<eos> Because no matter how hard you try and how much we want it, there's the people who serve the bread, and the people who eat the bread!<eos> And for once, it would be nice if you would be on my side.<eos> How bad?<eos> They want $60,000.<eos> No boob job costs $60,000.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> This one does.
Maybe you were feeling pretty sad.<eos> Saddest you'd ever felt in your entire life.<eos> You parked your car.<eos> What colour car?<eos> Blue?<eos> Two door or four door?<eos> Four door.<eos> Why?<eos> What does that matter?<eos> It doesn't.
They try to -- they try to play into your guilt.<eos> Yeah, and my aunt bought into it, which means I'm stuck with the bill.<eos> But she did at least offer to help with the baby while she's in town.<eos> She good with kids?<eos> We'll see.<eos> He was asleep when I left.<eos> Mm. So, this poor lady has no idea what she's getting into?<eos> Hey, I sent, uh, flowers over to --<eos> Oh, yeah, I got 'em.<eos> Thanks. Hey, Lydia, how you doing?
He was my little boy.<eos> He was my little boy!<eos> That's what you call a final you to the L.A.P.D.<eos> Felix the Cat was an asshole but he purchased all the right permits, so he gets to enjoy a first-class escort to hell.<eos> You know, there's a rumor that he's laying on stacks of $1,000 bills.<eos> Perfect.<eos> So, most of the people that came here to mourn him are probably here to rob him.<eos> Johnny Crenshaw!<eos> Earl Dayton!<eos> How you doing, man?
A57 handle unknown trouble at 221 Selma Avenue.<eos> P/R reports suspicious activity at the vacant building.<eos> A57. Show us handling.<eos> A57. Show us code 6.<eos> Look at this idiot.<eos> We don't catch the smart ones.<eos> You want to go ruin his day? Absolutely.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Excuse me, sir!<eos> How you doing?
Hang on.<eos> Enough of this memory-lane bullshit.<eos> It's an old C.I. of mine.<eos> Used to buy from NBKs.<eos> I'll take two seconds.<eos> Sam, we have a job to do. We can't be chasing this one --<eos> It'll take two seconds.<eos> Victoria.<eos> Officer Bryant. Hey.<eos> How you doing?
Cos how many boys is it you've kissed again?<eos> I'd rather have only kissed one boy than give mouth-to-south resuscitation to someone twice my age in a Vauxhall Nova on a bit of scrubland behind a SPAR.<eos> Do you know, you're always making me feel guilty for having things.<eos> You think I've got it so easy, Rae, and you've got no idea what it's like to have to walk into a room and have everyone look at you.<eos> All of the time.<eos> I do know what it feels like... to walk into a room and have everybody stare at me.<eos> Do you know that every time we talk to boys... they're not talking to us, they're talking to you?<eos> Whatever, Rae!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Of course you don't, Princess Chloe.
Thank you for that tip.<eos> Oh, wait. Do you know where this Andy fella is?<eos> He's up there.<eos> - Heaven?<eos> On the roof?<eos> Well, that was on the tip of my tongue.<eos> I want you on the tip of my tongue.<eos> Oh, come, baby. Wait a second.<eos> If Ellie didn't like you, why did she agree to sell?<eos> She didn't.
No. Being afraid doesn't accomplish anything.<eos> It's not true.<eos> When I'm overseas, rational fear of disease or violence, that sort of fear keeps you alive.<eos> Back here, God, I find myself afraid of things that I can't name or point to.<eos> It's like, how little am I seeing?<eos> Or have I wasted this day or this moment?<eos> Yeah, I think that sometimes, whether my life will add up.<eos> Francis would roll his eyes if he heard me talking like this.<eos> Does he know where you are?<eos> No, he doesn't.
Are you... are you avoiding me?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> We'll talk.<eos> You'll keep me in the loop about Aidan's behaviour.<eos> - Do I have to worry about you?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - Do you trust her?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I do.
I'm gonna go check on my kid.<eos> Fair enough, but I can't promise these'll wait for you! (Chuckles) (Door closes)<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Certainly didn't mean to startle you.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause... kind of seems like you did.<eos> It's just, the door was unlocked, and as neighbors, we're welcome to traipse in and out of each other's homes, aren't we, George?<eos> I thought so.<eos> I trust you, George.<eos> I really do.
She barely looked at me.<eos> That's the criteria?<eos> I'm just saying. You should have seen those chicks fighting over me at the bar.<eos> Anyway, it's like me and Caleb's dad.<eos> Just because we've all gotten in the habit of thinking the worst of people doesn't mean it true.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Ezra's back.<eos> And so is miss Fitz-scary.<eos> Oh, I didn't order that.<eos> I did.
Here.<eos> Did you have a fight with someone?<eos> Mrs. Hastings, if you tell my parents, it's only going to make it worse.<eos> Promise me you won't say anything.<eos> Come here.<eos> I'm just being weird.<eos> Overly sensitive.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You never told this to the police?<eos> Of course I did.
There was nothing I could've done for any of them!<eos> Tell me she's lying.<eos> Tell me this isn't you.<eos> He was going to expose me.<eos> You stood to lose everything.<eos> So you stole drugs from the hospital, you incapacitated him, and you killed him, because he knew.<eos> What did he know?<eos> He walked into a movie halfway through, watched two minutes, and he had an opinion?<eos> About ethnic cleansing?<eos> The whole world does.
They said they saw me on TV.<eos> You shouldn't have run off like that.<eos> I was worried sick.<eos> You said I could call my mom. - Did you mean it? - Sure.<eos> You can call her whenever you want.<eos> You found him.<eos> Where were you, squirt?<eos> You had us worried.<eos> I didn't find him.<eos> Some friendly neighbors back there did.
And it's, like, a hundo-times stronger on people that I've strudeled.<eos> You think you have a superpower? Now I'm getting a skeptical vibe.<eos> - Very good. - Yeah.<eos> Everyone in our gang has a special power.<eos> We're like The Avengers.<eos> Nice nerd reference.<eos> Together we could take down the Chitauri Army.<eos> Took it too far?<eos> Anyway, no one has superpowers.<eos> Sure we do.
- I thought you were done with Sam.<eos> It's a schoolboy crush he's taking a step too far.<eos> Maybe you seduced her.<eos> Sally, Alex and I are just friends.<eos> If you believe that, then you are dumber than you look.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Savi told me... the baby.<eos> For the first time since you told me, I feel better. I saw Paul.<eos> I just saw my dead husband.<eos> No, you didn't.
I don't know.<eos> So you just drew up the contracts just in case?<eos> You know what? What... what if it is yours?<eos> What would you want?<eos> Partial custody, I mean, visitation rights?<eos> Is that what you signed up for when we slept together?<eos> Of course not.<eos> But it happened.<eos> Do you even want a kid right now?<eos> Because Harry and I do.
Try the guac. It's to die. Wait.<eos> Um, how can you do that?<eos> What do you mean you can...<eos> I don't know.<eos> But why don't we just take the emergency brake off and see where this thing goes.<eos> Okay?<eos> What exactly are you saying?<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Let's go for it.<eos> Do the whole relationship thing.
Have you seen Adam?<eos> Adam, uh, six feet tall, brown hair, lives with a chick who's w-w-way too hot for him?<eos> All right, even your compliments are creepy.<eos> All right, he's with Timmy, and they're with a client for the rest of the afternoon.<eos> Ugh. So coming down here was a complete waste of time.<eos> Well, now, not necessarily.<eos> What are you talking about? Well, you seem tense, and, uh...<eos> I think I have just the thing to relax you.<eos> Yeah, you wish.<eos> No, you do.
- Come by later if you feel better.<eos> - Probably not gonna happen.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> I can set a place for you if you want to stay for dinner.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - That's the furniture.<eos> Does Bill know you're here?<eos> I didn't tell them.<eos> And Bill doesn't know you took the furniture, does he?<eos> No, he doesn't.
Honestly, it got away from me.<eos> Things got crazy.<eos> She had a stomach flu.<eos> It was a long week, Richard.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just forgot.<eos> Something happen?<eos> Yes, but it's over now.<eos> Miranda left.<eos> Yes, she did.
I know, I know, but now Gray Leverson's falling like shit and I'm supposed to be up there selling.<eos> Right now I'm supposed to be making a move.<eos> So, why aren't you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just a hunch.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> - Or I'm just shit.<eos> - No, you're not shit.<eos> - You know something, don't you?<eos> - No, I don't. Yes.
My beta levels are sky-high.<eos> Rm Pregnant!<eos> That's great news, isn't it?<eos> - Some enthusiasm!<eos> - It's the last thing I expected to hear.<eos> You're telling me!<eos> Isn't it crazy?<eos> - We have space, right?<eos> - We more or less have money...<eos> We do.
You've been impetuous before. You've even been risky. But this is the first time you've ever been stupid.<eos> You changed Abby's record.<eos> Is that a question?<eos> No, but I do have one...<eos> Why?<eos> I-I was trying to be nice.<eos> Try again.<eos> I, uh... I've got this friend who is always getting into trouble, you know, dragging everybody down, and he's got this horrible habit of just disappearing, leaving everyone else to clean up all his messes. So I-I-I guess I just learned how to do that.<eos> How'd you know it was me?<eos> I didn't.
I mean, you don't write it down, but you know it.<eos> Did the hairs on the back of your neck stand up?<eos> She could be mean.<eos> We don't diagnose 'mean.'<eos> Did they stand up?<eos> We don't diagnose 'cold' or 'bitch' either.<eos> And she's all that.<eos> You're not answering the question.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They did.
He's a scourge of God, his first date, he burned down the kingdom's most antique chalet.<eos> I don't even want him as a fake boyfriend!<eos> But it works, tickets for the concert for Sudan are going like wildfire.<eos> Just think of all the charity I can do after four months like this.<eos> No, after four months with that beast, we'll need charity ourselves.<eos> Kick him out of the kingdom!<eos> You don't care about my dreams, you're only interested in...<eos> your "parties".<eos> How dare you!<eos> But I do.
You don't have to answer that.<eos> That's true, but I want to understand.<eos> Why take a man's life?<eos> When Mr. Martin woke up, the worst you were guilty of was break and enter.<eos> They would have given you probation.<eos> But I wouldn't be invisible anymore.<eos> I like to be invisible.<eos> Where that kid's going, he's going to wish he was invisible.<eos> That kid needs help.<eos> Most of them do.

Sometimes, we do, but we try to be really discreet about it, and...<eos> Discreet's good.<eos> I'm sorry. Liane.<eos> I'm, uh, Ben.<eos> I have a thought, Ben.<eos> I could go get you a plate of Kenny's hockey puck meatloaf and let you go back to your book, or...<eos> I can get out that cherry pie that I've been saving, and you could tell me all about the things people are hiding underneath their clothes.<eos> Uh, I-I love a good cherry pie.<eos> Right?<eos> Who doesn't?
Okay, I found the web site Carey gave us.<eos> All right, now what?<eos> I give them a name.<eos> "Alice... has just made contact "<eos> I mean, how can we believe what Carey told us? Believe any of this?<eos> It's a chance to get to the man.<eos> I can't pass that up.<eos> Okay. Then sign me up, too.<eos> You don't know the show like a True Believer does.<eos> Like I do.
Olivia Leland.<eos> The murder?<eos> That case was solved years ago.<eos> By Detective Sakelik.<eos> You might want to look into the case again.<eos> Look into the Leland case.<eos> You didn't have to kill Annabelle.<eos> She was going to ruin everything.<eos> Annabelle didn't want what we want.<eos> She never did.
Maybe you should ask your partner.<eos> He's the one who brought Louis in.<eos> It has something to do with the Olivia Leland case.<eos> No.<eos> I'm sure you can imagine my, uh...<eos> Discomfort when Louis called me from the station.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> There's something else that worries me.<eos> Louis tells me you and he had a fight.<eos> - We did... - Don't.
Hey.<eos> That was some fancy shooting earlier.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Deep down, you're probably wondering what would've happened if I'd missed, right?<eos> No, you don't strike me as a guy who misses.<eos> You got a first name, officer Dunn?<eos> Riley.<eos> You like hockey?<eos> Sure.<eos> Who doesn't?
Agent Parker how many people are a part of Joe Carroll's cult?<eos> Early evidence suggested somewhere under 12, but... in light of Carroll's recent escape, tactical resources, manpower, it could be upwards of a hundred.<eos> Carroll's visitors log in prison contained 47 false identities, and his internet usage, although heavily encrypted, suggested twice that many.<eos> That's a guess at best, Agent.<eos> Are we looking for a cult compound like Waco or Jonestown?<eos> Yes.<eos> We believe there to be some sort of safe haven.<eos> But you don't know where that is.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
Wait, you sell the car to somebody else?<eos> Something like that.<eos> And then... where do they take 'em?<eos> Far away, across the deep blue sea.<eos> Forget about it.<eos> You just made 1,500 bucks.<eos> That's cool.<eos> And it can go up from there.<eos> You like tequila?<eos> Who doesn't?
Good.<eos> Right.<eos> Car's just outside.<eos> Dad wants a cup of tea.<eos> I'll make it.<eos> You all right?<eos> Do you wanna make it work?<eos> - You and Yvonne.<eos> Do you really wanna make it work?<eos> - Aye, I do, but...
But they all said she'd been acting odd during the past few weeks.<eos> They assumed it had to do with a case.<eos> Which case?<eos> Pick one.<eos> Introducing the wealthy men of Manhattan.<eos> Michelle represented all their wives in ongoing divorces, And some of these angry husbands had threatened her.<eos> The only problem is, none of 'em matched our sketch.<eos> Maybe that's because one of them hired our mystery man to kill Michelle.<eos> But we won't know which one until we find this guy.<eos> And I just did.
She never was my favorite trophy.<eos> Now why don't you two get the hell out of my home?<eos> Well, Billy did it.<eos> He killed his wife to keep his money, Then had Michelle murdered when she found evidence of it.<eos> Only how do we prove it?<eos> Well, all roads lead to Noah.<eos> So if we can catch him, we'll get him to turn on Billy.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Only we don't have any way of finding him.<eos> Actually, we do.
Because everybody loved Billy.<eos> You try being married to him.<eos> He was a hero in public and a monster at home.<eos> When I finally got the courage to divorce him, you know how the media portrayed me?<eos> As just another gold digging trophy wife, looking for her half.<eos> He destroyed my reputation.<eos> He was gonna destroy me. The only way I could get my life back was to die.<eos> But you needed help.<eos> And Walter needed the money.<eos> At least he did at the time.
I mean, I know your apartment is habitable again, I just... do you have to leave?<eos> Do you want me here because you actually want me here or do you need protection from the redheads?<eos> A little of both.<eos> Okay, I'll tell you what.<eos> If it gets to be too much, You can come and stay... at my place.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you sure it's okay that I'm going to Paris without you?<eos> Just because I'm sick, you shouldn't miss it.<eos> I want you to go.<eos> We all do.
Martha.<eos> Well, this has been... oh, shoot.<eos> I left my purse upstairs.<eos> Be a dear.<eos> I'll grab it.<eos> Detective Beckett, it was a real pleasure.<eos> Yes, it really was.<eos> You know, Meredith, it's so funny.<eos> When you first came and insisted on staying here, I was afraid that you might have had a secret agenda.<eos> Actually, I did.
Is that what you want to hear? - He would have dumped me in a month and gone back to Truly.<eos> - Is that what you want to hear?<eos> He would have realized he was out of his mind.<eos> That Vegas made him crazy.<eos> He would have dropped to his knees and asked your forgiveness for bringing the devil to Paradise?<eos> I can't take you like this without a drink.<eos> ( Sighs ) I'm going back on stage.<eos> Michelle, just come home.<eos> You don't want me there.<eos> - Of course I do.

You hear everything just like he was right in front of you.<eos> He is right in front of me.<eos> But this is a movie.<eos> Somehow that makes it seem more real.<eos> If that makes any sense.<eos> It does when you say it.<eos> - We've got a rehearsal, pumpkin.<eos> - Not till 4:00.<eos> You know what the Scouts say, "Be prepared."<eos> So does my gynecologist.
- Are you really trying for morning sex?<eos> - I am.<eos> Can I get on top so I don't have to look up your nose?<eos> Yep, yep.<eos> I'm sorry. My heart's not in it.<eos> Oh, no one cares.<eos> Except for me.<eos> I-I do.
- That has nothing to do with it.<eos> So how does Peter fight him?<eos> The way wolves usually do.<eos> Then he can do the same thing?<eos> He can turn when the moon is wrong?<eos> Not for free.<eos> Nothing is for free.<eos> Then what's the price?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who does?
We're falling apart, David.<eos> You knew what you were buying into.<eos> You said they deserved it.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Those people didn't deserve what happened to them.<eos> Nobody does.
Give it to me.<eos> Give it to me, give it to me!<eos> - Mom, your hand.<eos> Get the emergency kit. It's in the bathroom cabinet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You liked it.<eos> Mother!<eos> We have to call 911. No! No.<eos> We're not calling 911.<eos> Not doing it.
I can handle it on my own. Just go away.<eos> I found the gun.<eos> Watch your backs.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Frank Ashkani, you're under arrest for the murder of Tommy Sutter.<eos> You have the right to remind silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.<eos> You have the right to an attorney.<eos> If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you by the courts.<eos> - You did this to me.
- Keep looking.<eos> Hank, I know where he is.<eos> He abandoned his car at Quimby and Aspen terrace.<eos> - You heard that?<eos> - Yeah. That's Kelly's neighborhood.<eos> She lives two blocks away.<eos> And remember, in the books it said the jinnamuru xunte would often revisit the victim's families, going after them.<eos> He never went back to the first victim's family.<eos> She didn't have any family.<eos> Kelly does.
Don't you want to stay for my call to the judge? Or do you want to be held in contempt in absentia?<eos> Given this evidence, Mr. Canning, I rule for the plaintiff.<eos> Present the witness or be held in contempt.<eos> When is the earliest he can be deposed?<eos> Tomorrow morning at 10:00.<eos> Your Honor, Mr. Canning has been saying that for two days now.<eos> Mr. Ingersol is dealing with an ongoing emergency.<eos> Mr. Canning, have your client there at 10:00 a.m. or be held in contempt.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I do.
You acted like we were a couple.<eos> That's why I didn't wanna stay in the same hotel room, that's why I didn't wanna play The Newlywed Game, and that's why I didn't wanna go to this damn baby shower!<eos> Yes, dear.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Yes, dear.<eos> I am not messing around.<eos> We are not now, nor will we ever be, a couple.<eos> So you're not gonna pass that truck? You're just gonna stay behind it for the next 75 miles?<eos> You really didn't like me defending you?<eos> No, I did.
Caterer?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We're getting married.<eos> It's kind of freaky, right?<eos> I can't believe it's in less than a week.<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> I guess I'm just having one of those moments where I'm seeing my life from the outside in.<eos> Maybe Dixon will understand what I'm talking about.<eos> Why don't I have a number for Dixon?<eos> None of us do.
No, we don't think of you...<eos> That is why I've made up my mind.<eos> You guys kindly took me in during a very difficult time.<eos> I'm making a little money, and it is time for me to stand on my own two feet.<eos> I... am gonna start contributing to the rent.<eos> It's a bit. She's doing a bit. (Laughs)<eos> That's hysterical.<eos> What?<eos> Honey, you don't... You don't have any money.<eos> Yeah, I kinda do.
And I'm a hell of a ventriloquist.<eos> But I can't give you your ring back early.<eos> Oh, come on. You know I'm good for it.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm a businesswoman, Virginia.<eos> When you bring me my money, I'll give you your ring.<eos> The fertility clinic is paying 50 bucks for every donation.<eos> Nothing says romance like buying your fiancée a ring with money you earned by knocking up dozens of lesbians.<eos> Did you find the ring?<eos> I did one better.
Gonna feel like you took the brown acid, and it's trying to kill you.<eos> The handcuffs are so you won't hurt yourselves.<eos> And when one of you starts bugging out we'll know who's on tap to be puppy chow.<eos> So, what's our play?<eos> While you camp here, figure out who whored their soul I'm gonna scout the grounds see if I can't gank Huckleberry Hound before he makes his next move.<eos> - You're not going alone.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> - Wrong.<eos> - Uh, they're on lockdown, you need back-up.<eos> - No, I don't.
Lost your passport?<eos> I've just found out I have to pass a physical examination.<eos> I've never been a stranger to a treacle sponge.<eos> Married life's only made me more accustomed.<eos> I get out of puff when I do the stairs.<eos> I might not pass.<eos> Good.<eos> You'll both stay here then.<eos> Camilla thinks I'm in already.<eos> We both did.
Of course.<eos> The nurse is here, Dad.<eos> Mr Masterson, I'm Nurse Lee.<eos> I'm here to give you an injection, and to keep an eye on your legs, and check the sore on your shoulder.<eos> Oh, goody gumdrops.<eos> I'll be coming in every morning, early, to get you clean, tidy and comfortable.<eos> I'll leave you to it.<eos> Oh, you don't have to.<eos> Do stay if you want to.<eos> She doesn't.
Yeah!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Come on, let's go find him, eh?<eos> I'd do anything for her.<eos> I know.<eos> She'd do anything for him.<eos> I can't even tell you the things that people say.<eos> Ignore them, Mrs Gray.<eos> You know your own daughter.<eos> Yeah. I do.
And you make sure you hold her hand!<eos> 'Nonnatus House...'<eos> I've watched people do this time after time.<eos> Sitting waiting for news, not knowing, hoping.<eos> Never really known what they felt... until now.<eos> She's still in theatre.<eos> There was another haemorrhage.<eos> We haven't got a telephone number for Madeira.<eos> Her family don't even know what's happened.<eos> Yes, they do.
I think dad wants us to pick up where he left off -- saving people, hunting things... the family business.<eos> We have to carry out his legacy.<eos> It's a bloodline.<eos> It's in your blood, your father's blood, your family's blood.<eos> I like that John kid.<eos> You do?
I mean, not on purpose.<eos> Maybe he time-traveled here and, I don't know, got stuck.<eos> Yeah, well, either way, dad hated the son of a bitch.<eos> And dad made up for that how?<eos> By being father of the year?<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Look, dad had his issues, okay, but he was always there for us.<eos> I freaking hate time-travel, man.<eos> How you doing?
- Great.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Oh, Gregg, uh, glad you're not dead.<eos> Me, too.<eos> - Bye.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Now you can hit that. No.<eos> In order for me to "hit that," he has to want to "hit" this, which he doesn't.<eos> He totally does.
Bobby, get the bag! Bobby, get the bag!<eos> - Bobby, get the bag!<eos> - Wh-- wh--<eos> Whoo-ooh-ooh!<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> - Oh! Hey, man. It's pretty badass that you stopped crying.<eos> I think I may just be out of tears.<eos> Hey, why did you pick me instead of Riggs?<eos> I know people say that redheads are shady and shiftless--<eos> They do?
Well, come on, then!<eos> When you were 11, you walked on your tiptoes for nine months.<eos> No-one knew why, but you, you had done since you started secondary school.<eos> Mum and Dad tried you on all sorts of pills and therapy, but still you tiptoed.<eos> Everyone knew I did that.<eos> Those special clogs.<eos> Do you remember those clogs?<eos> You wore them in the morning but after Mum dropped you off at the bus stop, you'd take them off, put them in your backpack, put on some pumps and be back on your toes by the time the coach pulled up.<eos> Everyone thought you'd be like that for ever and they didn't know why.<eos> But I did.
That's because we had no idea what was coming.<eos> But now, we have intelligence on one of them.<eos> Councillor Macy, we have a wolf in our midst.<eos> "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.<eos> "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: "He leadeth me beside the still waters.<eos> "He restoreth my soul: "He leadeth me to walk in righteousness "for His name's sake...<eos> "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, "yet will I fear no evil: for Thou art with me...<eos> "Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me..."<eos> Bill?<eos> What you doing?
Oh God.<eos> So are you going?<eos> Just go.<eos> Nazif, papa give me a marker.<eos> Bye, baby girl.<eos> Mama, give me a marker.<eos> I don't have one.<eos> But you do, you have many.<eos> I do not.<eos> You do, you do.
Aw, some English fellow.<eos> Supposed to be here with the oil company cleanup.<eos> I think I met him somewhere before.<eos> Well, first time in bluebell, but I hear he's lived all over-<eos> - Rome, Paris.<eos> Maybe he played football.<eos> Oh, don't you start that, too.<eos> Now, it's called soccer, and I still say it's not gonna catch on here.<eos> Did I tell you already how beautiful you're looking?<eos> You did. Oh.
You're feeling threatened.<eos> Oh, Jesus. Fuck off.<eos> I'm just looking out for you.<eos> Well, don't.<eos> I'm happy.<eos> Well, then don't expect me to be there when you're not happy anymore.<eos> Okay, I won't expect that.<eos> But you will be.<eos> Because you love me.<eos> Of course I do, you stupid lesbian.
(Whispers) He is so cool!<eos> I knew you wouldn't change.<eos> You know what?<eos> Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with your brother. Oh.<eos> Ya see... there's a roommate protocol, and I believe that that leads to a sacred bond...<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - ...between two people under one-- Yep.<eos> Uh, you see, uh, one time, Max was caught in a well.<eos> I could've gotten out of that well.<eos> - Yeah, but you didn't.
Hey, Lisa.<eos> Mother, would you please show This gentleman to the door and tell him that I do not wish to be disturbed again?<eos> Young lady, I think you have shown quite enough attitude today.<eos> Now if you can't be polite to Malik, then I am gonna take away your library privileges.<eos> You know what, mrs. Shay?<eos> Maybe you should back off.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I'm sick of hearing the way you talk to Lisa.<eos> She doesn't deserve that tone.<eos> Nobody does.
I want it, Jake.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> I mean, I went looking for it, and I can't find it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> I'm helping my brother... my brother is asking me to help her pay her bills.<eos> I don't know what broke inside you, but something's broken, man.<eos> I get it.<eos> Man, I don't owe you a damn thing.<eos> Yeah, you do.
She barely seems to have noticed.<eos> I imagine that was Father Brown's point.<eos> This is a very fine oolong.<eos> Such a shame the pot wasn't warmed before pouring in water.<eos> Next time you can make it yourself.<eos> Though, of course, that would involve setting foot in a kitchen.<eos> I wonder what made such a distinguished man of science throw off medicine.<eos> Maybe something happened on his trip to India.<eos> How long did you say you'd known him?<eos> I didn't.
Sorry?<eos> Tamsin Henshall is the sister of a Tanya Henshall.<eos> She lives with Andy Ibbotson at the address Lee and Kev picked him up from.<eos> Was she not there this morning when we turned the place over?<eos> Not that I know of, no.<eos> And this isn't the first time it's happened.<eos> Tanya's always getting stuff sent to her sister's address using stolen bank cards.<eos> No kidding!<eos> Did you get a phone number for her off this sister?<eos> Yes, I did.
I really don't think that I can face going to meet my mother on Friday.<eos> Rachel.<eos> Is it all right if we come in?<eos> - Why?<eos> - You don't want to do this on the doorstep.<eos> We're here to arrest you on suspicion of murder.<eos> How would you respond if I told you your brother Dominic had told us you incited him to attack Nicholas Savage?<eos> I didn't.<eos> And you said you'd like to see him dead.<eos> I didn't.
Assuming I don't get sent down for the next 300 years for something I haven't done, but yeah!<eos> Rachel.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hey!<eos> It's good that you're making plans.<eos> That's exactly what you should be doing, bugger them!<eos> That's what... Yeah.<eos> This is such good news, Rachel.<eos> He thinks the world of you.<eos> He always did.
-Was it them?<eos> -We don't know.<eos> We've yet to link Joe, forensically, either with Sheila's death or with the bodies that were buried in the cellar, but -<eos> We have no reason to think it was anyone else, at the moment.<eos> Those two girls got convicted.<eos> Who had pushed that old woman into the canal in the wheelie bin.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -13 and 14 years old.<eos> People think I know things.<eos> I didn't.
And I said it must've been a wrong number.<eos> But you were suspicious and you wanted to ring him back.<eos> And I called your bluff and said, "Go ahead," but you didn't.<eos> I'd been with him in a hotel.<eos> Last night I slept with Kevin at Janet's.<eos> Janet walked in on us, kicked us out.<eos> She's washed her hands of me.<eos> I stayed at Kevin's.<eos> I don't know why I did it.<eos> Well, I do but... not fully.
We need you.<eos> I have to find Audrey.<eos> You did say that access to police resources was the only reason you came back.<eos> If you were just a detective, you'd be under less scrutiny.<eos> Maybe bending the rules here and there might be easier.<eos> I'll do what I can, but it's all just a band-aid until we find Audrey.<eos> Hey!<eos> There you are.<eos> Yep. Did you find the tornado lady?<eos> Yeah, as a matter of fact, we did.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> Uh, hey, um, you got a second?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you hold that for a second?<eos> Uh, okay, so, um, look, I know you think<eos> I was using Megan to get back at you, and... and although torturing you does feel good, um... it's not right.<eos> So I'm gonna stop.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You, know, I just realized that torturing you is just another way of hating you, and I don't want to hate you, Ade.<eos> I don't.
I loved you.<eos> Alex, when I saw you today in the hospital--<eos> You mean, when you ran away.<eos> I have... played this moment over and over in my head for years. Okay?<eos> I'm-I'm-I'm so sorry.<eos> I can't do this.<eos> Alex, I wanted to contact you every day. Okay?<eos> Believe me. Every day, but... it was easier to imagine that you had some perfect husband, and three perfect kids somewhere.<eos> I wanted that in my life, once.<eos> We both did.
He'd come round to play with Tom.<eos> He'd always come and find me.<eos> We'd have a chat.<eos> He told me he couldn't talk to his dad like that.<eos> That's... when we started... meeting, just the two of us.<eos> Did you tell Ellie or Tom?<eos> Why not?<eos> I wanted something that was mine.<eos> Ellie has her job.<eos> Tom... does his own thing.
- I can do it myself. - No.<eos> I have to.<eos> While I still can.<eos> Please?<eos> I know how the safety works.<eos> Well, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I tried.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You did.<eos> You did.
That is not true.<eos> On a gay site, you actually have to be good-looking.<eos> On a straight site, you just need to have a job.<eos> And maybe not even have a job.<eos> All right. You know what?<eos> You think it's so easy to pick up girls on a straight site. Then why don't you try?<eos> Okay. Fine. And you try to pick up guys on a gay site.<eos> Whoever has the most hits at the end of 24 hours wins, and the loser has to admit that the other is better looking and pay for cab for the next month.<eos> You don't think that sounds like a ridiculous way to determine which one of us is better looking?<eos> - No, I do not.
Yeah.<eos> Maybe I should take a trip to Boca.<eos> Now that sounds like a plan.<eos> And then when you're strong enough, I'll talk about a treatment path.<eos> Chemo?<eos> You know, when Hannah lost all her hair, I went to this, uh, hasidic wig shop.<eos> bought her one of each kind.<eos> So you could be with a different woman every night?<eos> You got my number.<eos> I do.
I'd like you to meet Charlie Harris.<eos> Charlie Harris?<eos> In the flesh.<eos> Um, Dr. Reid, would you give us a couple of minutes alone?<eos> Have a good look, sport.<eos> This is how it ends... dying alone.<eos> She doesn't know, does she?<eos> About the, uh, ghosts?<eos> No.<eos> No, she doesn't.
You know what they say about lawyers, right?<eos> It's like a pie-eating contest with a prize of more pie.<eos> That man carried a stranger 12 blocks.<eos> He can have as much pie as he wants.<eos> I don't think you're getting it.<eos> The pie is a bad thing in the scenario.<eos> You understand?<eos> I understand what you mean, but I like pie.<eos> I thought we had backup power.<eos> We did.
I'll write you a note.<eos> "Graham couldn't come to work today."<eos> "He was too busy saving a man's life."<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Your father?<eos> How'd you find out?<eos> He woke up and told us his name.<eos> You must think I'm a bad person.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
But we're very close.<eos> And my manager Glenn is gonna walk me down the aisle.<eos> Not your mother?<eos> She unfortunately can't make it, it being last minute and all.<eos> I'm sure those rehab facilities are quite strict with patients leaving.<eos> Was she excited when you told her?<eos> I haven't gotten the chance to tell her yet.<eos> Really?<eos> Don't you want her to meet the man that you're gonna spend the rest of your life with?<eos> Of course I do.
No, I-I'm in Los Angeles, becoming a surgeon, too.<eos> I-I have things I want to do... and be.<eos> And-and-and w... we may only be together five minutes every two months, but hey, when we do, we will savor every second.<eos> Because we both know how valuable those five minutes are.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> More than I can hold in my heart.<eos> You're sure about that?<eos> I am completely sure of that.<eos> Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me, even if it is only in... 5-minute increments every two months?<eos> I do.
I have little use for their kind in years.<eos> In face of difficulty, large grievances become... so minor.<eos> Oh, wait!<eos> I wanna try something.<eos> Doctors say the longer you stay in a coma, the less likely you are to wake up.<eos> Doctors.<eos> You really have a way with words.<eos> Can you tell me a story about being a gypsy?<eos> You guys realize I'm half Italian, right?<eos> We do.
- So you believe me now?<eos> Yeah, I believe you.<eos> But that doesn't mean you get to treat this place like the bloody roadside motel.<eos> Are you gonna talk to somebody about this, Aidan?<eos> I got it under control.<eos> I'm gonna hit the showers.<eos> - Hey, how'd it go with Veterans Affairs?<eos> - It didn't.<eos> What, they don't have a database for disability claims?<eos> Oh, they do.
I mean, to say hello to, yeah.<eos> - Did Pete know him?<eos> - He and Jesse were close, looked out for each other.<eos> I think Jesse was there when Pete got injured.<eos> If you wanna find Pete, you should talk to Jesse.<eos> We gotta go, that was the deal!<eos> We do the job, then we hit the road.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - You trying to get caught?<eos> How you doing, buddy?
Won't come out. Won't talk, won't eat.<eos> What have you done? What have I done?<eos> Debbie failed her exams.<eos> Shit.<eos> What did you expect?<eos> She's been copping it from the kids at school.<eos> She can't hack it.<eos> Did you speak to the principal?<eos> They're supposed to be looking out for her.<eos> Of course I bloody did!
- Yeah, the men told me.<eos> What I want to know is what the Feds want at a local crime scene.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Lieutenant Jason Decker, Pennsylvania state police.<eos> That's the boyfriend, the one who got shot.<eos> Lieutenant, we believe that your suspect is someone we've been hunting.<eos> He's wanted in the abduction of several women, all in different states.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I know who did this.<eos> - You do?
I think I've heard just about enough.<eos> Chester... we're leaving.<eos> Mrs. Fitzpatrick, please, I...<eos> You ready to stop playing games?<eos> I don't know who this Ian person is, and I certainly don't have $45,000 for you.<eos> He told us all about your little scam there at the morgue.<eos> From what we hear, you're rolling in it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> We know all about Lieutenant Prietto.<eos> Well, who doesn't?
Listen, I've decided.<eos> I'm going to take all of Raymond Chandler on the trains with me.<eos> I'll tear out the pages as I read them and throw them out the window.<eos> I don't expect they'll notice, with all that litter out there.<eos> Did you speak to Dad? Yeah.<eos> He thinks you should finish your studies first.<eos> The truth is, he can't wait to get rid of you. You and your hormones.<eos> Mm, they aren't mine.<eos> I quite like the idea of having a little sister.<eos> Oh, you do, do you? Yeah.
I didn't want to run off without saying good night.<eos> I suppose you think I behaved very badly down there.<eos> My dear, I'm not really very interested in whether you behaved badly or well.<eos> No?<eos> No.<eos> I am not your governess.<eos> I'm your grandmother.<eos> And the difference is?<eos> The difference is... I love you.<eos> Of course you do.
Have a good day, Tom.<eos> You, too.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Anne Glass.<eos> Second time she's called.<eos> Did she say what it was about?<eos> Yeah, she said it was personal.<eos> I assumed you knew her.<eos> I don't.
Do you want to know why?<eos> Because it doesn't make any sense.<eos> Amy was crazy about you.<eos> She would have gone home with you willingly.<eos> I bet any of those girls would.<eos> There's no tape.<eos> It's just you and me.<eos> You honestly want to know why?<eos> Because I don't want their fucking permission.<eos> I never did.
- Lauren told them that?<eos> - Yeah, she was pretty torn up about it.<eos> But you know how she is ... duty before booty.<eos> - Is that my phone?<eos> - Oh yeah...<eos> Oh... speak of the devil.<eos> Hey, Lauren... we were just talking about you.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Did you talk to Dyson?<eos> Yeah, well, he did most of the talking.
Someone else I need to talk to.<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> It's all over...<eos> Mom?<eos> Beth!<eos> How was Cherry Fest?<eos> Did you make a lot of new friends?<eos> People are always just falling in love with you, aren't they?<eos> You don't remember the last time you saw me, do you?<eos> Well, of course I do.
Can we turn it on with some sort of remote?<eos> Let me guess:<eos> someone's standing right beside you?<eos> Crap.<eos> So?<eos> Well, if you can find the actual traveller, and get them to turn on their CMR, then we could link it to the suit and send a steady signal.<eos> Any idea how to find them? I'll call you back.<eos> Gotta go visit a sick friend.<eos> Your garage sale guy did not know what he was selling.<eos> Maybe he did.
The tent's big enough for all of us.<eos> You want us to make peace with the Kings?<eos> They declared war on us!<eos> Who the hell are you to speak for all the leaders?<eos> Someone's got to.<eos> 'Cause they can't speak for themselves.<eos> What the hell did you do?<eos> If I'm not mistaken, that's your boss, Mr. Wolford.<eos> Kings didn't do any of this.<eos> No gang did this.
That monster's beyond saving.<eos> I'm sparing you a lifetime of pain and misery.<eos> You... you can't keep us apart forever.<eos> I'll fight for him.<eos> I'll never stop fighting for him!<eos> Okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Belle...<eos> It... it worked.<eos> Yes, it did.
I'm sparing you a lifetime of pain and misery.<eos> You... you can't keep us apart forever.<eos> I'll fight for him.<eos> I'll never stop fighting for him!<eos> Okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Belle...<eos> It... it worked.<eos> Yes, it did.<eos> It did.
Patron saint of travellers, sailors, pilots, and bachelors.<eos> Is that why you have it?<eos> The bachelor part.<eos> Well, actually, it belonged to Abby, my wife.<eos> Same as those clothes.<eos> She ain't dead, is she?<eos> Not that I know of.<eos> Good.<eos> Wouldn't feel right wearing a dead woman's clothes.<eos> So, which one of you did the leaving?
Well, must have been a year after I first joined the sheriff's department before I could put on my uniform without feeling like I was wearing a costume.<eos> Bet you looked awful handsome.<eos> Do you think that... That I could ever be the kind of woman who belongs in these clothes? And walk into church and not have people say,<eos> "Now, ain't that sweet? The whore's come to get saved?"<eos> I think... If you pretend to be something long enough, it's not pretending.<eos> I guess my first step would be to get right with the Lord.<eos> 'Cause of how you made your living?<eos> Oh, not just that.<eos> What else?<eos> Something to do with Ava Crowder?
- Can we see the outside?<eos> - Of course.<eos> It sits on over an acre of grass.<eos> Again, a lot of upkeep.<eos> Are you sure I can't show you something a little further down the Hill?<eos> There are some lovely starter homes down there, beautiful views, quaint.<eos> - You and your husband might...<eos> You and your fiancé might want to think about the commute.<eos> What kind of work did you say you do?<eos> We didn't.
No.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Well, I was wondering if you could do me a really big favor and get me inside.<eos> I just want to get some of his stuff.<eos> I know I barely know you and it's a lot to ask, but somehow it seemed like it would be okay to ask you anyway.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'll check it out.<eos> I really appreciate it.<eos> Well, I got to go play high school now.<eos> Yeah, you do that.
So what are you gonna do now about Abernathy? Nothing.<eos> Nothing?<eos> You're a sheriff.<eos> Law enforcement.<eos> You have ways of finding things out, like, things you do.<eos> Not unless we have a lead.<eos> Do you have anything else?<eos> I mean, besides the florist card that says, "See you soon".<eos> Do you have a license plate or any names that he might have mentioned or a location he might be going?<eos> Do you?
- That's not what she's doing.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> No, no, she's trying to help me.<eos> She's trying to seduce you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Then why doesn't she close the door?<eos> Because--<eos> Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> - She does not!<eos> - Of course she does.
You have to be.<eos> Fate, in this moment, has chosen you.<eos> Now you've got to learn One of the most noble and difficult of virtues--<eos> Patience.<eos> But when will I know?<eos> You counseled patience.<eos> For years, I didn't know what that meant.<eos> I waited here.<eos> I kept this slip, I kept this boat afloat, Not knowing for what.<eos> Now I do.
We have to get the cross to people who can protect us,<eos> People who can submit it to rigorous scientific analysis<eos> So we can find out once and for all<eos> Whether or not there's magic in it<eos> Or if it's just two really old planks of wood.<eos> You don't like that plan, you can walk.<eos> Where?<eos> I've got nowhere else to go.<eos> Then let's start figuring it out.<eos> How you doing, hank?
Okay, he's gonna sit this one out.<eos> He's not hungry? I don't know, Syd.<eos> I guess not.<eos> Then I'm not eating my brussels sprouts.<eos> If Victor doesn't have to eat anything,<eos> I'm not eating these brussels sprouts.<eos> - Yes, you--<eos> Syd, three sprouts.<eos> We'll be right back.<eos> Not doing it!
No, I actually do my own laundry, but thank you.<eos> The machine in my building has been out.<eos> [Laughs] Yeah, for five years.<eos> Boy, get out of here.<eos> You knew that?<eos> I gotta say, that's quite a sight.<eos> A grown-ass man having his laundry folded by his mother.<eos> I remember my sister telling me that your mother did your laundry until you bought this house.<eos> - Oh, did she say that?<eos> - She sure did.
I called his name.<eos> He turned, he saw me, I know he did.<eos> What happened?<eos> This guy came and grabbed me, another guy joined him.<eos> Punched me, kicked me, told me never to return.<eos> I passed out.<eos> This is terrible, my friend.<eos> I'm not gonna give up.<eos> Tell me, how do you know Dr. Mac again?<eos> In truth... we do not.
How do you know that, sweetheart?<eos> I see things.<eos> What do you mean you see things-<eos> - What things?<eos> I see visions.<eos> People.<eos> Sometimes I see them before they happen.<eos> How often?<eos> I see things when I see them.<eos> I don't when I don't.
Cross-reference Amelia's DNA with her mother's so you can prove who she is.<eos> You'll know that Aster Corps faked her death and that I'm telling the truth.<eos> Detective, I need to find my son.<eos> I need to find my son now!<eos> We have been here long enough, my friend.<eos> We should go home.<eos> Doctor.<eos> Dr. McCormick.<eos> - Do I know you?<eos> - No, you do not.
- Okay, look, Michael.<eos> Look, you're right, okay?<eos> I'll stop, I'll stop.<eos> Just please don't tell Nikita.<eos> Please.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> We're needed back at the office.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Don't.
Go through the camera footage. Let us know what you find.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right?<eos> Yeah, I'm on it.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> Exactly what it looks like.<eos> You actually think that I had something to do with Parish getting killed?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Didn't anyone ever tell you that a warrior wouldn't be caught dead in a tailored suit?<eos> Yeah, you did, long time ago.
Hey.<eos> You sure?<eos> All right.<eos> Who was that?<eos> That was Ava.<eos> What'd she say?<eos> She said, that if you're ready to come back to work, I mean really work, then there's a place for you at Audrey's.<eos> I can work! I can work! I will!<eos> She say why?<eos> No, she did not.
Did you know that he was engaged?<eos> You know, I heard it from Rick, in QD, who heard it from Arlene in Reception.<eos> Word travels fast around here.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Ever since Hodges accused me of trying to steal Wendy...<eos> Wait, who's Wendy?<eos> Our old DNA analyst.<eos> Uh, anyway, since then, he doesn't really confide in me anymore.<eos> Okay, you have some results for me.<eos> I do.
We'll work alongside your team if that's all right.<eos> Whatever you need.<eos> Everybody take a room.<eos> Mr. Morrison, I'm Aaron Hotchner from the FBI.<eos> My team's here to help gather information to find your children.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> But shouldn't you be out there looking for my girls?<eos> We have to start where they were last seen.<eos> I know you think I did this.<eos> They all do.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> What can I do?<eos> They say that if you just tell them where mom is that this will all just be--<eos> But I don't know.<eos> You know I don't know.<eos> She didn't just disappear, Dad.<eos> Oh, God, you killed her, didn't you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
Mr. Earnhart, glad you could make it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know I never pass up an opportunity to get paid to drink good whiskey.<eos> Well, I think you're in luck.<eos> We have a lot of amazing micro-distillers here today. - Enjoy.<eos> - Thank you. Mm-hmm.<eos> You ready for a tasting?<eos> Nice.<eos> It looks like the pickle juice worked.<eos> Always does.
Yes.<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> I wrote her a letter.<eos> When?<eos> Last year.<eos> I told her how I felt, and... she wrote back, and we kept writing.<eos> She was going to leave him this time.<eos> Did Chad Dunn know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But if he did,
He strikes and kills Lyla Cutwright, and then, he moves to the other side as Dunn exits.<eos> With his hand, the killer bashes Dunn's head up against the car.<eos> I found blood and hair transfer from Dunn here.<eos> The hit rendered him unconscious.<eos> The killer then moves Dunn into the car, and drives it off the ridge while he's running alongside.<eos> Well, how does he push down on the gas?<eos> Reenter the weapon used to kill Cutwright.<eos> I found the same aluminum fragments on the gas pedal as I did in her head wound.<eos> I thought you said the weapon was made out of chestnut?<eos> I did.
- Good, that means you're free.<eos> I accidentally ran into Lana again.<eos> And judging by your looks, I'm just gonna get right to it.<eos> She's coming to dinner tomorrow night.<eos> Well, thanks for letting me know so I have time to make other plans.<eos> And I will be using an excuse to be named later.<eos> Oh, come on, she really wants to meet her baby's big sister.<eos> Lana wants to meet me?<eos> - Bay wants to meet me?<eos> - Of course she does.
Maybe. Maybe not.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's okay.<eos> If you need to leave, you need to use the back door.<eos> I can't have Victoria seeing you here again.<eos> Okay.<eos> So glad you could make it, Emily.<eos> What a lovely view of my beach house.<eos> I hardly noticed.<eos> You certainly did the other night.
- Adam, um, I--<eos> - And Nora and Otis.<eos> It's all set.<eos> All you have to do-- pack a bathing suit and a good book, honey.<eos> I really wish that you would've talked to me before booking this trip.<eos> Don't worry about the money.<eos> We had a good month at The Luncheonette, okay?<eos> We're fine. I'm not worried about that at all, honey.<eos> We don't know that I'm healthy. We do, honey.<eos> - We don't, no.
And then, out of nowhere, it just, like-- it came back,<eos> - and it's in her lungs. - I know that.<eos> I know that.<eos> It's everywhere, and she's scared.<eos> I feel terrible, and I'm sorry that she's scared, but that's not you.<eos> - That's not you.<eos> - How do we know that?<eos> - We don't know that, Adam.<eos> - Yes, we do, honey. Listen to me.<eos> We don't, okay?
After that, it'll be too late for him to fire us.<eos> Lemon?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What... what do you think she's doing here?<eos> Offering me unwelcome tips on how to plate my vegetables.<eos> I am sorry for intruding, but I thought that it was my duty as a citizen to offer my skills.<eos> You know what?<eos> That's very kind of you, lemon.<eos> And if you're serious about offering your skills, I think I have the perfect assignment for you.<eos> You do?
Ah, Quentin, love.<eos> Hello.<eos> Are you supposed to be smoking those?<eos> Oh, cancer is so slow.<eos> Something far more interesting is bound to kill me first.<eos> I hear plague is a popular way to go.<eos> What is it?<eos> You wouldn't be here unless there was something on your mind.<eos> At my house, you said you knew what really happened to my mom.<eos> Oh, so I did.
Because I'm topless right now.<eos> Oh, yes it is.<eos> Ms. Everson, Tom is still holding.<eos> Tell him I just need a couple of minutes.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry, is that your assistant on the phone?<eos> Yeah, he's on all my calls.<eos> Hey, Ben. Did you get my e-mail with the parking info for tomorrow?<eos> Yeah, uh...<eos> yeah, I did, um, Bruce.
What kind of stuff does she like?<eos> I'm really sorry; I shouldn't have... I don't, I shouldn't talk about that stuff in front of you.<eos> That's... horrible.<eos> You are totally... a friend of a friend of Will's, and he's my, like, ex-neighbor, except he's not, 'cause he still lives in the house that he lives in, which is next to mine, which makes him my neighbor. I'm sorry;<eos> I've been known to get a little crazy sometimes, and I real... mm.<eos> Trust me... I'm okay with crazy.<eos> I really want to wash my hands.<eos> You can wash your hands after.<eos> You kissed him.<eos> And then I did it again.
There is a legal analysis.<eos> There's a memorandum that allows the president to do this.<eos> Great.<eos> Can we see it?<eos> Does it have a name or is that secret, too?<eos> What's our role here, guys?<eos> Demand the memorandum be made public.<eos> You think it's gonna make our lives easier if I appear to be defending a leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula?<eos> Who cares about our lives being easier?<eos> I do!
It reeks of excess.<eos> Oh, you're a communist, I forgot.<eos> How many Germans starve while others live like this?<eos> You don't seem to be minding the excess now, you big Polack.<eos> This is special occasion for me.<eos> How would you like to join me in cigar?<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> I trust we have plans for getting inside this train factory.<eos> We do.
Douglas is a very good man. -But a terrible plumber.<eos> -Oh, dear.<eos> So...here to round up some lost sheep?<eos> Atomic physics and telepathy.<eos> What talents!<eos> I would love to have you all back at St Mary's. But that's not why I'm here.<eos> I have heard that Dr. Evans is no longer working with you.<eos> That is correct.<eos> His departure has fanned the flames of village gossip, which I do not believe for a minute.<eos> -However, many do.
I spotted the crush months ago.<eos> "Just a stage".<eos> That's what I said to Geoffrey.<eos> Neither of us wanted to scare off such a marvellous doctor.<eos> We trusted him.<eos> You don't yet know what's happened.<eos> You've not seen Ruth's diary.<eos> My daughter... ..is not the child I thought she was.<eos> Did you know Ruth Bennett had a crush on you?<eos> No, I did not.
What do you mean, there'll be no school?<eos> Ask the mayor.<eos> I don't know why you bother with make-up.<eos> You can't improve on perfection.<eos> Don't even think about coming to me for a reference.<eos> What?<eos> Lord knows, you'll never be pretty, Kathleen, but if you smile from time to time, you might look less like the spawn of Satan.<eos> Your father's very stressed at the moment.<eos> He doesn't know what he's saying.<eos> He doesn't...
Aren't you here to do just that?<eos> Speak on his behalf?<eos> If I were to speculate, I think the President would...<eos> Speculation is a poor form of investment, and an equally poor form of politics.<eos> Tell me what you know.<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> Well, what do you think I should do?<eos> You personally, Frank Underwood?<eos> My opinion isn't what matters here.<eos> It does to me.
No. I'm not waiting around if he's knee deep in whackjob.<eos> As soon as I'm in the barn, I'm gonna call it in.<eos> Okay, do not rush this.<eos> Oh, I'ma rush this.<eos> All right, dude, in retrospect, it probably wasn't a good idea to stay the night.<eos> - Johnny, I swear to God.<eos> - I'm sorry, man.<eos> Don't move, asshole.<eos> Dale, I mean, I thought that we had something really special together.<eos> No, we really didn't.
That's too soon.<eos> What are you afraid of?<eos> My father's a stubborn, hot-tempered old man with no lawyer!<eos> Posticipare... postpone it? Why?<eos> You've been waiting nearly two years.<eos> Try, Marco!<eos> The train alone takes a full day to get there!<eos> So don't take the train.<eos> Well I don't have a car.<eos> But you do, though, don't you?
It's a baby, Silver.<eos> People have them all the time.<eos> Yeah, but this is my baby, okay?<eos> And since I can't carry it myself, I'm paying you to be responsible and take it seriously.<eos> All right, look.<eos> I know this is weird for you, because it's really weird for me, too.<eos> I had a vision for how my pregnancy would go, and it most definitely did not involve a surrogate.<eos> So, everything that I was planning on doing for my baby, I... I have to do through you.<eos> Does that make sense?<eos> Yeah, it does.
Okay, that is a, a beautiful speech.<eos> Okay, where is he?<eos> Mr. Lowry, if the congressman is as big on law enforcement as you say, then you understand, we have to do our job.<eos> Now, where is he?<eos> We're not going to ask you again.<eos> Geez.<eos> Ah, boy.<eos> We've been spinning all morning to cover for him.<eos> Oh, you don't even know where he is?<eos> No, we don't.
Well, tonight we're just a couple of young secretaries.<eos> Answer it.<eos> Hello?<eos> How did you do that?<eos> I didn't do anything. He likes you.<eos> What?<eos> Just a minute. Let me ask my girlfriend.<eos> He wants us to meet him after his shift.<eos> Well, tell him you know a place.<eos> But I don't.
Yes, for a crazy person, you seem great.<eos> I love you, Henry.<eos> And I won't let anything come between us, Ever.<eos> You ready?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Does she know I'm coming?<eos> Your mother's emotions on this will be complex.<eos> I'm not sure even she knows what to expect. And my first priority is protecting her.<eos> I thought you said that she wanted to see me.<eos> Well, she does.
All right?<eos> All right.<eos> Sasha?<eos> I'm sure you both have a lot to talk about.<eos> Episode 1x10:<eos> The Comfort Of Death<eos> What do you think of this one?<eos> I still like the first one better.<eos> It's got more depth, better color saturation.<eos> Yeah, so do I. Here.
In fact, I know almost everything about you.<eos> Where you're from, who you work for.<eos> How you ended up in that bed. Information is my business.<eos> This is what your government sent you to find.<eos> Something they were so eager to destroy that they were willing to kill you too.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> An answer to a very interesting question.<eos> Would you like to know what that question is?<eos> I don't care.<eos> No, you don't, do you?
'Cause it's a Wednesday night, baby, and I'm alive.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I don't want anything.<eos> Really, I'm only here to actually let you know that I know about you and Elijah.<eos> - Hannah...<eos> - I told her.<eos> Yeah. My dear roommate and very serious ex-boyfriend told me he had sex with my best friend.<eos> Hannah, I'm very sorry.<eos> I really didn't want you to hear about it like this.<eos> I really, really didn't.
- Because I fucked Marnie?<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> - You don't wanna give this one more try? - I do not, no.<eos> - Okay, look, I made a mistake.<eos> - I know.<eos> Listen. It just says so much about who you are right now.<eos> I've spent so much time confused and I'm not anymore, so I don't want to be with someone who's confused or-- or bi.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - I thought you knew what you wanted. I did.<eos> I do.
So where are we at?<eos> The insurance company found a loophole.<eos> Apparently there's a rule that no more than two attendings are allowed on a medi plane.<eos> So when Dr. Robbins took Dr. Karev's place on the flight...<eos> Anyway, they say they aren't gonna pay.<eos> Okay, so who pays?<eos> We do.<eos> The hospital.<eos> We don't have that kind of reserve.<eos> No, we don't.
I only survived because of one man, Frank Delano.<eos> The man you killed.<eos> Delano murdered my wife.<eos> He would've killed my cousin and me, too, if he had the chance.<eos> His brother don't see it that way.<eos> He put me in here.<eos> And now you die here.<eos> Kaleo, you're making a mistake.<eos> You care what happens to him?<eos> I don't.
There!<eos> And they're kissing!<eos> Fujii, gimme the camera!<eos> What're you doing?<eos> Fuck, I missed the kiss.<eos> Please, kiss again!<eos> Hey, where are you going, Fujii?<eos> Goddammit, I missed it.<eos> Mother, you already ate.<eos> No, I didn't.
We will start with the questioning of the witness by the prosecutor.<eos> Witness Junji Sudo, please approach the bench.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> What made you submit your confession?<eos> What is your motive?<eos> I want revenge on Takao Kimura.<eos> After you were sentenced to death, you wrote it in a letter while under appeal.<eos> Yes.<eos> Despite you knew, it would affect your appeal unfavorably?<eos> Yes, I did.
Well it's a pleasure to be here, ladies.<eos> I didn't think anybody really cared about my time on the city council.<eos> Oh, we do.
- Let's cut off our toes!<eos> - No, let's not.<eos> I'm gonna take this bag, too.<eos> You need to fix this.<eos> It's not that bad. Nobody got hurt.<eos> It's extremely bad!<eos> I love this woman, and I just wanna show her that I'm capable of watching her children without something horrible happening.<eos> What?<eos> Did you just say you love Diane?<eos> No. I did not.
- You do that?<eos> Hang on.<eos> Are you feeling insecure? Because that's my thing, and if you take it away, I don't know what I'm bringing to this relationship.<eos> Yes, Leonard, I am insecure.<eos> Happy?<eos> No, not happy.<eos> Why are you smiling?<eos> I'm just sorry.<eos> I'm ye- - Just... never think of you having feelings like that.<eos> - Well, I do.
Yes.<eos> We're working on that.<eos> So...<eos> Those were your fingerprints in the house.<eos> Well, I've spent a lot of time in her house.<eos> But your fingerprints were everywhere.<eos> Under the bed, inside the bathroom cabinets, all over the closet shelves.<eos> You were looking for something.<eos> And I know you didn't find it...<eos> Because we did.
Anthony's statement plus Blaylock's corroborating statement gives us a rock-solid felony murder case against both guys.<eos> Yeah, thank God for civilized lies.<eos> It's moments like these remind me how much I love this job. Aw.<eos> I'm only gonna say this once.<eos> Did an amazing job in that room. Thank you.<eos> Yeah, our work is done here.<eos> Let's wrap it up and go home.<eos> Detective Messer, thank you for coming.<eos> Oh, not at all. - This is my husband, Danny. - Hey.<eos> How you doing, man?
Look, man. We're not trying to jam you up...<eos> I know where I've seen you.<eos> You work with Detective Beckett.<eos> We just have a few more questions.<eos> Then call my lawyer.<eos> The guy's guilty as hell, but he has an alibi.<eos> He was at some conference all day.<eos> Ryan's checking it out now.<eos> It's gonna check out.<eos> He never does this on his own.
Because we can get to you anytime... anytime.<eos> Your whole family.<eos> You see that's true, don't you?<eos> Get me the clock now.<eos> Honey.<eos> I was thinking this weekend maybe we'd go to the mall together.<eos> You want to take me bra shopping?<eos> Yeah, I thought that would be nice.<eos> Mom, it's like... kids don't really buy bras with their moms.<eos> Sure, they do.
Look, I know you're tired, but just think how good you're gonna feel tomorrow when you wake up and we have new shelf paper!<eos> I wish I didn't get what you are talking about, but I do. I just do.<eos> Hey, who could be calling at this hour?<eos> - Oh. It's Sal. - Mnh-mnh.<eos> No.<eos> Not answering that.<eos> Whatever earth-shattering drama she's going through can wait.<eos> Until she gets here.<eos> Oh, God. I hope we have vodka.<eos> We don't, Mitchell.
You're a good man.<eos> But that outburst --<eos> It was stress.<eos> And I haven't been sleeping that well.<eos> No, it was more than that.<eos> You were out of control, and you know it.<eos> I just... I thought getting shot was gonna be the worst thing that could happen.<eos> Six weeks from shipping out, and my unit gets ambushed.<eos> I should have died.<eos> A lot of good men did.
She does assistant work for Professor Cornwallis.<eos> I'll bet she does.<eos> We failed?<eos> This is terrible.<eos> I need that paper to graduate.<eos> Who screwed up their section?<eos> - Jeff, it doesn't matter.<eos> - No, it matters to me.<eos> I want to know who cost me my early graduation.<eos> - I didn't do anything wrong.
I mean, you know damn well we could use a break.<eos> What if we finally got one?<eos> Are you gonna take off the dead-guy robe?<eos> Well, well...<eos> It's so late.<eos> I didn't expect you in at all.<eos> Three times I had to transfer the bus lines to lose him today.<eos> Right -- your sinister friend.<eos> You don't believe me I'm being followed.<eos> Nobody ever does.
How may I help you?<eos> Hi, Stacy.<eos> This is Detective Cooper over at Miami Metro.<eos> My badge number is 143634.<eos> We're investigating a hit-and-run.<eos> We think somebody who rented one of your vans might have been a witness. I was hoping to get some information over the phone.<eos> I can fax you over a copy of the warrant if you'd like.<eos> Oh, I'll just get it for you.<eos> Do you have the license plate?<eos> Yes, I do.
My dad says you're a total rock star.<eos> Why'd you leave?<eos> She's a curious one.<eos> Let's go see some files over here.<eos> Nice to meet you!<eos> What the fuck are you doing with Zach Hamilton?<eos> Quinn called.<eos> He thinks Zach killed Cassie.<eos> I thought so too, but I checked it out.<eos> Zach didn't.
What did you take, Stuart?<eos> I took a couple of Tylenols.<eos> Well, next time, ask!<eos> Come on in.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> [Laughs nervously] Can I get you anything to drink?<eos> Some orange juice, water, cash to make this all go away?<eos> Miss Franklin, about the fire...<eos> Oh, who cares about a little ol'fire?<eos> The little ol'board does.
I'm going to go get some air.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Nominated for an award.<eos> What have you two done today?<eos> I found a lump under one of my balls.<eos> Okay, that's something.<eos> I ate three quarters of an Entenmann's strudel.<eos> Youse are good kids.<eos> Hey, so did you get a chance to read my play?<eos> Uh... I did. I did.
Is it weird to thank you for liking me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well.<eos> Coming through!<eos> Whoa! Ridiculous.<eos> Every time we try to kiss, something happens.<eos> I know! This should be easier, right?<eos> Do you ever think that... maybe if fate can bring two people together-- fate... could also tell two people they're better as friends?<eos> I mean, it's-- it's crossed my mind, yeah, but... do you think that's us?<eos> No. I don't.
This time. Nobody follow me. Especially you.<eos> Charles ex-wife.<eos> Julie Cameron.<eos> I got her picture off his email.<eos> When you called her office, they said she was off sick today.<eos> She didn't show up. She didn't even call.<eos> No way that's a coincidence.<eos> I think we need to pay the former Mrs. Alomar a visit.<eos> Already got her home address.<eos> Of course you do.
Why not?<eos> Maybe because you flipped out and you're in a hospital and you've been doing drugs? - I don't do drugs.<eos> - Cocaine...<eos> I don't do drugs.<eos> I don't do drugs.<eos> I don't.<eos> Who believes you?<eos> Who's gonna believe you?<eos> ...inner cities, infrastructure, environmental issues - that's what's before us.<eos> He will.
- Yes, but not what you think.<eos> Again about free travel.<eos> Would you like them to give a huge fine?<eos> I gave them the name of someone but I forgot the date of birth.<eos> Assholes!<eos> - Why did not you buy yourself a monthly ticket?<eos> - I do not buy personal travel.<eos> These assholes do not get penny from me.<eos> - Take it!<eos> - I will not!

When they work, Hal takes the credit for them.<eos> When they don't, the president takes the hits.<eos> Have you reminded Charles of that?<eos> I can't.<eos> Hal's the vice president.<eos> I'm just the chief of staff.<eos> You have influence that supercedes any constitutional rank.<eos> And now's the time to use it.<eos> I want to see the statement as soon as it's issued.<eos> You will.
You can go on through now, sir.<eos> Let him through.<eos> Thank you, Captain.<eos> All teams are in position, Jack.<eos> No one moves in until I confirm that it's her.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Collette won't show herself if she senses anything's wrong.<eos> Make sure he stays hidden.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He will.
Cos we had a big argument. I didn't want you to think I had a motive.<eos> OK.<eos> What did you argue about?<eos> abigail Zealy?<eos> - No, man.<eos> Just merchandising.<eos> - You argued about merchandising?<eos> Yeah. Warren thought he deserved 70% for the concept, but I think since I did the drawings, I...<eos> - Do you have a publisher?<eos> - No. And now we never will.
Yeah, you too.<eos> Would you like a drink?<eos> Yeah, that would be great.<eos> I can get it.<eos> Just wanted to finish the sentence.<eos> Excellent book-- shame to put it down.<eos> I hope martinis will be fine.<eos> Ooh, better than fine.<eos> Will Rory be having a martini?<eos> Yes, she will.
I'll bet if we check the copy machine log, it will tell us that copies were made with mrs. Hauser's code, say, 4:03, 4:04 P.M.<eos> Should I call them over?<eos> You're bluffing.<eos> The copy machine can't do that.<eos> Well, here's your choice.<eos> You can call my bluff, and we'll all find out exactly what the copy machine can do.<eos> Of course, if you choose that option, I'm posting this Tritons photo on your home page.<eos> I've heard what happens to Tritons who reveal their secrets.<eos> I don't have a home page.<eos> You will.
Suddenly a bee flew over to you, and I chased it away.<eos> It was such a beautiful day.<eos> Since then, there hasn't been a day that I did not think of you.<eos> But, an indecent imagination had taken me over.<eos> But I could not differentiate whether it was love or an indecent desire.<eos> That is why I had such a hard time professing my true feelings.<eos> If my life hangs on the word love, how can I say it?<eos> Simply, I will keep it in my heart<eos> until I see you in the afterworld.<eos> I will.
Sorry, sorry.<eos> Where is Roberto?<eos> He's not coming.<eos> He says he doesn't want your money.<eos> Papa, it is his job to provide for our baby.<eos> And how does he expect to provide for my grandchild?<eos> He's a clown!<eos> He is an artist.<eos> Brigitte, we agreed that the trust fund would be a safety net in case things don't work out.<eos> But they will.
Think about it.<eos> The lake doesn't freeze like that, does it?<eos> It freezes level.<eos> It's nothing to do with hills.<eos> You need four-wheel drive...<eos> Four-wheel drive will give you control in slippery corners.<eos> That's what it's for.<eos> That's why rally cars are four-wheel drive.<eos> You need four-wheel drive.<eos> - No, you won't.
- That's all.<eos> - What's that?<eos> Yeah, if you haven't figured it out by now, you probably won't.<eos> Doesn't matter, just as long as everything's back to what it should be.<eos> It will be if you get us back.<eos> I mean, otherwise...<eos> How are we gonna get them back?<eos> Oh, I can take care of that.<eos> Yeah, but how will you know when to take them back to?<eos> Well, the ring will.
- Ma.<eos> Aquamom!<eos> I love it.<eos> Boom!<eos> There's no way Ma's coming to L.A., bro.<eos> - No way.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> You've never gotten her to come before.<eos> What makes you think she'll come now?<eos> - She won't.
Despite your nice white shirts with their impeccably ironed collars, you're about as elegant as a pile of shit, sweetheart.<eos> It's cruel to act like you made a mistake.<eos> Like you can't stay in bed.<eos> Like you must shower.<eos> Like "What have I done?"<eos> Like "Sorry I ever fucked you."<eos> What are you saying?<eos> You're forcing yourself, Paul.<eos> I won't hear this right now.<eos> But you will.
Yeah?<eos> The situation with Martha is taken care of.<eos> I spoke to her.<eos> And? And I made it very clear that if she continues with this behavior, I will send her back to the hospital in Vermont.<eos> Well, you were going to have her committed earlier today.<eos> But you changed your mind?<eos> It's because she found out the truth.<eos> And I decided I should keep her close.<eos> What if she finds out the truth again?<eos> She won't.
I want you to be happy, sweetheart. I've always just...<eos> Just wanted you to be happy... but not with him.<eos> Jonathan. You know you're the only man I've ever loved.<eos> It's been... so hard without you.<eos> Your voice, your touch.<eos> I miss you so much.<eos> I miss you too, sweetheart.<eos> Why did you have to leave me? I'm sorry, Martha.<eos> I didn't have any choice.<eos> And soon, neither will a lot of other innocent people.
For me too.<eos> - Three months did you say?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Unless she doesn't manage to cross the border.<eos> I've gotta find a job.<eos> We'll manage.<eos> We have each other.<eos> Gabi!<eos> What if she wakes up?<eos> She won't.
I prefer not to be hanged before my wife is queen.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> "Who but Reynald?" they'll say.<eos> It's always me.<eos> They'll believe it in Jerusalem, I assure you.<eos> You were at Nazareth, praying.<eos> You're a dangerous man.<eos> If the war's to be now or later, I would have it now.<eos> How long can the leper last?<eos> God wills it.

That I would rather live with men than kill them... is certainly why you are alive.<eos> That sort of Christianity has its uses, I suppose.<eos> We must not go to war with Saladin!<eos> We do not want it, and we may not win it.<eos> Blasphemy!<eos> Blasphemy!<eos> An army of Jesus Christ, which bears his holy cross, cannot be beaten.<eos> Does the count of Tiberias suggest that it could be?<eos> There must be war.<eos> God wills it!

- Precisely, sir.<eos> - Nice.<eos> - I couldn't find any mob bosses.<eos> - Well, sergeant?<eos> - lt's "lieutenant" now.<eos> You really started something. Bent cops running scared. Hope on the streets.<eos> - But?<eos> - The Narrows is lost.<eos> And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.<eos> We will.
I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Who did you think it was?<eos> Fuck you, Donohue.<eos> This is bandit country.<eos> Did you tell Curtiss where I'd be?<eos> Ghita's car?<eos> Well, Ghita's my only friend here, Tim.<eos> I wouldn't want her to get into trouble.<eos> She won't.
- Will you wait here for me?<eos> - Sure.<eos> You'll sit right here and wait?<eos> I'll just be five minutes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Why don't you say something?<eos> I will not talk about this.<eos> - We'll talk about this right now!<eos> - I won't!
That is a huge distraction. It's unacceptable.<eos> I don't believe this!<eos> You will be busy training.<eos> And four college courses.<eos> Four?<eos> Are you out of your mind, with everything she's doing?<eos> All right, two.<eos> But then four in the fall.<eos> Only if she wins sectionals.<eos> Oh, she will.
I say, "Satish... put me on a plane tomorrow to India. Tomorrow!" Dad?<eos> - Dad, say something.<eos> - I trusted you.<eos> I don't want to see your face.<eos> How can you say that to me?<eos> Fine.<eos> Then I'm gonna move in with Tony!<eos> Because he's been asking me.<eos> All this time I've been saying no because I've been thinking of you.<eos> But now I will.
I heard how your voice changed when the camera came between us.<eos> My voice changed because I felt sick because you drugged me.<eos> Yeah, you were drugged, all right.<eos> And the drug was sweet little 1 4-year-old flesh.<eos> Look...<eos> I'm a decent guy, ask anyone.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Call these models.<eos> They'll tell you.<eos> Of course they will.
May I finish?<eos> It's national security!<eos> - A real ladies' man!<eos> - Well, they're in love.<eos> We have no show for Tuesday, fellows. So get out there and make some news.<eos> Rob a bank.<eos> Mug an old lady.<eos> Do something.<eos> - You look at the Secretary Stevens footage?<eos> - We will.
With that? You don't need tools to get into the center, the door's open.<eos> Come when you want to.<eos> I got it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Excuse me, I'm the new Religion teacher.<eos> - What just happened?<eos> - You busted the box!<eos> Have you ever read "Il Manifesto"?<eos> - No!<eos> - Today we will.
Yes.<eos> Jumping into the river after you.<eos> What'll we tell Wrigley's mom if we come home without him?<eos> She thinks we're his friends.<eos> What next?<eos> Fritzli took the chock from under the chestnut-vendor's stall, it crashed into a railing and sent the chestnuts flying.<eos> Did Fritzli never tell you this?<eos> No.<eos> And here's a really good one.<eos> He never will.
Yes, please<eos> What is Santa bringing you?<eos> A baseball board game<eos> That's great<eos> I wonder if Santa's really coming<eos> Sure he will<eos> What do you think, Honey?<eos> I bet he won't this year He only visits good kids<eos> He won't come. Then<eos> Yes he will! He will!
We tried everything.<eos> Radiotherapy, bone marrow transplantation.<eos> Is he really cured?<eos> Take him to the doctor and let him investigate.<eos> Peters leukemia is gone.<eos> -It is a miracle.<eos> It still has to remain secret.<eos> You know that the confidentiality contract that you signed, is binding.<eos> People should know that young man.<eos> That they will.
I didn't know you did yoga.<eos> Oh yeah, just get back into it.<eos> - I have a private class at home on saturday.<eos> - Oh, that's great.<eos> Can you believe I've never done yoga before ?<eos> You should come on saturday. - Oh.<eos> - Yeah, join in.<eos> Mickey's joining.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Well, we will.
Well, we got the jeep right.<eos> And everything else wrong.<eos> The bodies had defensive wounds. Richard doesn't have a mark on him.<eos> We're missin' something.<eos> Something's not right about this.<eos> This is a boy's room... not a man's.<eos> Log in password.<eos> No, no-- wait, wait!<eos> - It's not turning back on.<eos> - Yeah. And it won't.
YOU GOT THAT?<eos> - I-<eos> - I HAVE.<eos> FORTHWITH,IN EVERY PROVINCE OF ITALY, ONE THIRD OF ALL THOSE EMPLOYED AT LABORING WITH CATTLE OR IN AGRICULTURE<eos> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.<eos> TOO MANY SLAVES,YOU SEE?<eos> THEY'VE TAKEN ALL THE WORK, WHICH CAUSES UNEMPLOYMENT AMONGST THE FREE POPULACE.<eos> NOW,WE NEED TO CREATE MORE JOBS FOR OUR CITIZENS.<eos> BUT IT WILL BE HUGELY EXPENVE! SI<eos> IT WILL.
Didn't take long to make him speak, eh ?<eos> Eh ?<eos> Creature !<eos> Who hired him ?<eos> Timon, the horse Jew.<eos> Atia's man.<eos> Dress me<eos> - It's done.<eos> - They'll have you back ?<eos> They will.
I think Maya should stay with us.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - Yes, I do because<eos> - Maybe this isn't the time.<eos> - Well, she's not going to.<eos> You're gonna be very busy once the baby comes.<eos> You don't know what it's like with a new-born.<eos> No, but I think I'll figure it out.<eos> She'll probably end up staying with us when the baby comes anyway.<eos> No, she won't.
I'll be in and out.<eos> Look, the quickest way to figure out what is going on is to to tap into the system and communicate directly with the Captain.<eos> Need I remind you of the obvious value in this.<eos> But is it safe?<eos> Would I be volunteering to go if it wasn't?<eos> No.<eos> Which is exactly what makes it safe enough for me to go.<eos> What?<eos> Better to have you on the outside, in case something goes wrong.<eos> It won't!
First things first. We gotta find it.<eos> -Oh, man, don't do that.<eos> -Anything?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> How much time we got?<eos> Fifteen minutes.<eos> Maybe we missed somebody.<eos> Maybe the thing's just not on the plane.<eos> You believe that?<eos> Well, I will if you will.
What did I do?<eos> You brought out the stupid in him.<eos> No, I'm sure you didn't tell him to go down that little school and beat the tar out of little Mr. Security Guard but... you blinked them big brown eyes and there he go.<eos> And I can't have that.<eos> You did that?<eos> Who you think done it?<eos> The Fuck-You-Up fairy?<eos> I didn't... I had no idea.<eos> - I never would have.<eos> - And you never will.
I hoped you would like to have you just take care of myself.<eos> I did not ever think I have a wife.<eos> I was too busy as a professor at Oxford.<eos> Anyway, I hoped.<eos> Oh, but it does not matter.<eos> I promised your father I'll take care of you.<eos> I always thought ... I like to leave your wealth to people Your waiting around to die.<eos> So I thought I'd pass my money and properties in your name now.<eos> - No, I can not.<eos> I will not!
Connie.<eos> - Baby, I can't do this tonight.<eos> - Do what, Emery?<eos> What?<eos> Some man attacks you out of the clear blue and I'm the only concerned one.<eos> - He didn't attack me.<eos> He just punched me.<eos> I walked up from behind him so he would've hit anybody.<eos> - What if he comes back?<eos> - He won't.
And it's always my fault.<eos> Because I'm stupid.<eos> I always get my hopes up.<eos> Then it all fizzles out.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're just in the dumps.<eos> But we'll get through it.<eos> -No, we won't.<eos> -Why not?<eos> Of course we will.
-Sign here.<eos> RRemember my uncle who can recall his past lives?<eos> You believe him?<eos> Sure.<eos> It's a true story.<eos> He was 90 years old when he came to our house.<eos> He could recall 200 years.<eos> I don't want to remember that long.<eos> 'Cos you don't have good memories.<eos> From now on I will.
Do you think whoever's driving the train killed Mandy?<eos> I don't know, but I really don't want to stay and find out.<eos> - I think I do. - No, come on.<eos> Seriously. Come on!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I wanna meet him.<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Look, if it's the driver, I'll call for you, all right? If it's not...<eos> I won't.
They're going to kill us.<eos> If they wanted to kill us, they would have done it by now.<eos> Why are they keeping us here?<eos> I keep thinking about Ditte.<eos> And little Gustav.<eos> I just want to ... I just want to hold him again soon.<eos> - I don't want to die.<eos> - You won't.<eos> - Why don't they find us, then?<eos> - They will.
We gotta check the records... from all fire emergencies that occurred there in the last two weeks. Go.<eos> On the night of Tuesday, the 17th... we got a fire alarm going off in the rear wing of 213, Stygian Street.<eos> It's an old listing. Used to be a mannequin factory.<eos> You think we have enough for a warrant, though?<eos> Who said anything about a warrant?<eos> - Right now?<eos> - Why not?<eos> Yeah, why not?<eos> At least we'll have the cover of darkness.<eos> Yeah, well, so will anybody else.
It is easy to have a blank memory with the emotion... of standing in front of an audience.<eos> I'm about to become a big brother.<eos> My parents have worked some sex magic!<eos> Breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Stay calm.<eos> Breathe.<eos> I'll take the other lane.<eos> ~ You want to cross the bridge?<eos> ~ Yes, we will.
Marwan, what do you do abroad?<eos> Business.<eos> Yes, but what kind of business?<eos> What do you sell?<eos> Whatever comes to your mind.<eos> Games for kids, games for adults. Watches...<eos> Marwan, when is your turn going to come?<eos> We want to see your children before we die.<eos> That we see your children, or that we die?<eos> When God wills what?
And if you're worried about criticism... sometimes a diet is the best defense.<eos> - Oh, hey, Gangy.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - D-plus. Sign this.<eos> - This is a D-minus.<eos> - Either way, it's above a "D," right?<eos> - Another world-beater.<eos> And Lindsay realized she needed to take a firmer hand with her daughter.<eos> - I'm not signing this.<eos> - Fine. I will.
- It's that so?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> . You're sure about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Because I really think I would like--<eos> I don't want to buy you a beer, but you're clearly a nutter and I think it might calm you down.<eos> Well, I don't want to drink with you either.<eos> - You will.
. You're sure about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Because I really think I would like--<eos> I don't want to buy you a beer, but you're clearly a nutter and I think it might calm you down.<eos> Well, I don't want to drink with you either.<eos> - You will.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I will.
- Our days are numbered.<eos> It's only a matter of time.<eos> But I truly believe if we prepare...<eos> Don't be naive, George.<eos> You weren't brought up that way.<eos> - There's no hope.<eos> - Stop saying that!<eos> Even if it's true, I can't give up.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
And her Uncle, the Abbot, has him castrated.<eos> It's timeless, really.<eos> Even though he becomes a monk and she a nun, their passion burns on through these incredible letters through the rest of their lives.<eos> You, with these books.<eos> Mm, education should never stop.<eos> It enriches all aspects of life.<eos> Hmm, I know.<eos> I wish someone could convince AJ of that.<eos> I keep thinking he could start over in college but who knows if he's even gonna get the chance.<eos> He will.
It's only actually four words and a digit.<eos> My siblings got 5 1, collectively.<eos> - Digits?<eos> - Words.<eos> I didn't know your brother was on a scholarship.<eos> Uh, you weren't though, were you?<eos> What if I only ever rate four words and a digit?<eos> What if by the time my mother's next book comes out, the sentence hasn't changed?<eos> It will.<eos> Well, the digit will.
They knows.<eos> They suspects us.<eos> What's it saying, my precious, my love?<eos> Is Smeagol losing his nerve?<eos> No.<eos> Not.<eos> Never.<eos> Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.<eos> Smeagol wants to see them dead.<eos> And we will.
Free will.<eos> My opponent says that Mr Stone came to her because what he had was not enough, that he wanted more.<eos> More what?<eos> More sex? More power? More control?<eos> That's what she'd have you believe.<eos> But when Mr Stone came to her, or rather when she came to Mr Stone, what my client really wanted was readers.<eos> He wanted people to read what he wrote.<eos> He's a writer.<eos> That's what writers want.<eos> An audience for his words, for his vision. For his truth, if you will.
You two were Dominic's chosen.<eos> What do you know about his excommunication?<eos> Nothing.<eos> He wouldn't speak of it.<eos> -Well, Dominic believed this other... this man was based right here in Rome.<eos> Now, that's all I know because that's all he told me... and I assume that the two of you plan to seek him out.<eos> Otherwise, I am just spinning my wheels here.<eos> Sadly, the church no longer has the will to dispatch.<eos> Thank God we still have the tools.<eos> The instrument of delivery, if you will.
"father in Christ and most illustrious prince. "forgive me that I should dare to write to you.<eos> "I make bold because it is my duty to serve you "and to warn you of the crooked practices of those wlo claim to represent Your Grace."<eos> "Christ did not commmmand the preaching of indulgences. but of tle Gospel."<eos> Forward this to Rome.<eos> "Christians are to be taught "that he who gives to the poor "or lends to the needy does a better deed than he who buys indulgences."<eos> "If the Pope can empty Purgatory, why would he not do so out of love rather than for money?"<eos> My God, who is this Martin Luther?<eos> Fritz!<eos> What? Dr. Luther wanted everyone to see that!<eos> And everyone will.
Did you get it?<eos> Did you get it?<eos> Don't say I never did anything for you.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Cops!<eos> Don't worry. He's busy.<eos> Sorry it took me so long, man. I was lookin' for something bigger.<eos> Oh, hey... I'm sorry.<eos> Even if they put it back on... it's not gonna work the same.<eos> Sure, it will.
I am sick ... are sick ... are sick, are sick ...<eos> I have AIDS ...<eos> No. .. no ...<eos> No, no no ... You do not need to be afraid<eos> They say that we must not be afraid because I could say that well be able to survive, you understand?<eos> but not here ... I have to go home .. you're already home!<eos> No, at home by my father, and Lisa take you with me<eos> No, no, you have to stay here<eos> I have to stop drugs, with your father and I can not close<eos> But he will only
and the water was so strange too, and the baby looked so strange, and everything was very strange. But grandma said everything was all right.<eos> We have to give him another bath.<eos> I took him out of the water then.<eos> I wrapped him in a sheet, and I thought that I would bring him in here and put him on this bed.<eos> And then I wanted to play with him, and he wasn't alive anymore.<eos> And grandma said that nothing is wrong, but he wasn't alive anymore.<eos> And in my dream I felt that if we would have a baby one day then I would kill it. I knew in my dream that is what I would do.<eos> It was only a dream.<eos> - Won't I do this?<eos> - No, you won't.
The police told me you took the train to school today.<eos> I did?<eos> Maybe I did.<eos> I can't remember.<eos> You can't?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I'm going to bed.<eos> You should do the same.<eos> You're right.<eos> I will.
Fear changes everything.<eos> - Atlas Shrugged?<eos> - Yeah, you read it?<eos> - No.<eos> - It's good.<eos> Anyway, you're gonna be fine.<eos> Just remember... don't let him take it.<eos> - I don't know what that means.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> But you will.
You want to put food on the table?<eos> Call Señora Rodriguez.<eos> You're right, Ma.<eos> I'm a good cleaning lady.<eos> I'll start over.<eos> But not with Mrs. Rodriguez.<eos> I'm gonna find a job as a maid in some hotel.<eos> After some time passes, I'm gonna apply for the management program.<eos> And when I get the chance to be a manager....<eos> And I will, Ma.
- Wiell... Yourfriends out there will.<eos> You know it.<eos> Hold back!<eos> Hold yourfire!<eos> Get the building secure.<eos> Give me the gun.<eos> - I don't want to shoot you.<eos> - You do. You think I deserve it.<eos> - Get back!<eos> - But you won't.
I want to take a nap before the benefit.<eos> It's all very simple.<eos> Why can't we build over the center?<eos> Because it will eat away our profits.<eos> There's to be a groundbreaking ceremony at Coney Island... with our friend Assemblyman Perez.<eos> All I need is one of your charming speeches.<eos> You're not gonna get one.<eos> I need you there.<eos> - I have to consult my schedule.<eos> - No, you won't.
It will be my honor... to see you dead!<eos> Not likely.<eos> Yeah! That's gonna work.<eos> All right.<eos> I got the plan.<eos> Death... by laser guillotine.<eos> - Four DRDs... clothesline the suckers.<eos> - And not harm their captives?<eos> Might work.<eos> Probably won't.
ARE OUR KIDS FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE OR WHAT?<eos> THEY ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY ARE.<eos> BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED.<eos> IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU LEARNED TO RIDE YOUR TWO-WHEELER.<eos> IF YOU WANT SOMETHING, NOTHING CAN STOP YOU.<eos> YOU!<eos> WELCOME TO GAYOPOLIS.<eos> HOME OF THAT FABULOUS SUPERHERO, RAGE.<eos> WHAT, YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF RAGE?<eos> WELL, YOU WILL AFTER TONIGHT.
And where I was shamed and ridiculed for being artistic.<eos> In your relationship with these men you have replaced your father with your brother as a figure of authority that you need to prove something to.<eos> You set up these scenarios with these men similar to your father and your brother seeking your brother, i.e. your father's, acceptance.<eos> - The hell with them.<eos> - I know.<eos> The work is to make new choices that have nothing to do with old patterns.<eos> I want to, Sandy.<eos> I do.<eos> God, give me the strength.<eos> She will.
Stupid woman!<eos> Cannot you get one simple thing right?<eos> And as for you, you'll do as I say, do you hear?<eos> And you'll like who I tell you to like, do you hear?<eos> Not listening. - Do you hear?<eos> - Not listening.<eos> Not listening.<eos> It will be magnificent.<eos> They will come.<eos> They will.
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE YOUNG AND YOU WILL ALWAYS BE BEAUTIFUL.<eos> YOU'RE BRIAN KINNEY, FOR FUCK'S SAKE!<eos> WELL, THE STAFF SEEMS VERY NICE. THEY'RE REALLY HELPFUL.<eos> THEY DO.<eos> YEAH. THEY SAID YOU CAN GET ANYTHING YOU WANT, ANYTIME.<eos> YOU KNOW, THEY GOT SNACKS ALL DAY...<eos> THAT'S GOOD.<eos> YEAH. AND IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, YOU JUST, UM...<eos> I...<eos> I WILL.
I'm just gonna stop by my bunk for a real quick sec.<eos> Maybe you should talk to him.<eos> So, then, Rabbi Rothstein says, "Sim, sim, sim, sim, ata..."<eos> Hey, McKinley.<eos> Did you take that shower yet?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Did you?<eos> No.<eos> Take a shower.<eos> Sorry, folks for the "coitus interruptus," if you will.
Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore.<eos> There's only the market now, and it doesn't care who you are.<eos> People still need values and beliefs.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> Not the smart ones.<eos> Look...<eos> I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax exempt status.<eos> But when you fall off this horse, come see me.<eos> I can show you how to make a lot of money. I don't care about money.<eos> You will.
When you're back call me to tell me how it went.<eos> It can be a while..<eos> Whenever.<eos> Call me if you like.<eos> Why, are there problems with the other guy?<eos> More or less..<eos> Hey if you want we can meet right now!<eos> You can tell me how things are going, if you like, as in fact I'm at your door.<eos> Paolo, don't start again.<eos> Ok, I won't.
Signifies... But how do I multiply it?<eos> How do I multiply...? Soon... they will kill him.<eos> An X, an X...<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Is it Russian or German?<eos> Since he's dying... they will execute the sentence.<eos> - Enough, enough already.<eos> - Shut the door!<eos> - Well, perhaps they won't kill him.<eos> - Yes they will.
That's good.<eos> -Can i feel?<eos> -No.<eos> -Why not?<eos> -l don't want you to.<eos> It's perfectly normal.<eos> They kick.<eos> They grow.<eos> -This will never end.<eos> -Of course it will.
I think the worst is over now.<eos> We took care of everything, so you can relax now.<eos> What's that friend of yours like?<eos> Shouldn't we buy him a drink?<eos> He probably won't drink.<eos> Why?<eos> He doesn't like to drink?<eos> Then how about giving him money?<eos> Or tell him to work under us.<eos> He probably won't.
Yeah, they are.<eos> [Frohike] And what glasses. [Whimpering] - It's your turn.<eos> - Oh, no, it's your turn.<eos> From now on.<eos> Stupid dog.<eos> He makes with the brown Play-Doh every 10 feet.<eos> I know the feeling, cleaning up someone else's mess.<eos> Again, I apologize.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Damn right it won't.
It's hypotension and electrical alternance on the monitor.<eos> This is tamponade.<eos> Viral infections can cause pericarditis and a rapid accumulation of fluid.<eos> It looks like a heart attack but don't let it fool you.<eos> BP's stabilizing.<eos> - What have we got?<eos> - Don't worry. We're fine here.<eos> It's a universal feeling to want to be there for a good friend.<eos> So from now on, I'm going to stop seeing Turk as my crazy frat brother.<eos> Dr Turk, if you will?
Time to go!<eos> Finish it tomorrow!<eos> No, I'm nearly there...<eos> Oh, Ming...<eos> - I need a few days off next month.<eos> - Why?<eos> I promised my wife a trip. Put in a word for me, will you?<eos> I'll speak to personnel.<eos> But the next lunch is on you.<eos> I will.
I wanna do it now!<eos> I can't fire them.<eos> Number three in the top five all-time breakup list?<eos> Charlie Nicholson. Sophomore year at college.<eos> Am I glad that's over. As soon as I saw her, I realized she was the kind of girl... I'd wanted to meet ever since I was old enough to meet girls.<eos> I mean, she was different. She was dramatic, and she was exotic.<eos> And she talked a lot, and when she talked... she said remarkably interesting things about music, books, film and politics.<eos> - And she talked a lot.<eos> - Have you ever seen him less than 300 feet tall? - No. - Huh?<eos> No. And you won't, will you, sweetheart?
- You don't know what happened tonight.<eos> - Oh, but I do.<eos> I passed my finals.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, Jo.<eos> I'm going to be starting my internship at Bellevue.<eos> It'll be crazy.<eos> I won't have time to see you.<eos> - It won't happen again.<eos> - Yes, it will.
I don't think you give a damn about the truth.<eos> I think you're looking for a scapegoat. We want justice.<eos> All right, then, listen up.<eos> Yes... we are lying.<eos> You say we're going to be executed at dawn. Is it some big surprise that we cover for one another?<eos> No, but it must stop. Okay.<eos> It stops here.<eos> I'll give it to you straight.<eos> I don't know what happened.<eos> Probably never will.
If your hand gets caught in the beam, it's gonna go numb for hours.<eos> Okay.<eos> My tongue is fat.<eos> My tongue... Wrench.<eos> Where is de wrench?<eos> Oh, dare it is.<eos> I'm stuck.<eos> You know, I find that Jar Jar creature to be a little odd.<eos> You don't even know if this thing's gonna run.<eos> - It will.
I just saw a man fall seven stories into a platter of poached salmon!<eos> - Did he break anything?<eos> - Everything!<eos> hey're still pulling capers out of him.<eos> People get depressed, they jump.<eos> It's a tragedy, but it ain't my fault.<eos> You're telling me it was a suicide?<eos> I think he left a note.<eos> Jelly, did they find it?<eos> No, but they will in a minute.
We have clothes, running water from a well.<eos> I am convinced these mutants will kill each other off--<eos> No, Calvin, we won't make do!<eos> Not me, not Adam !<eos> We're going up!<eos> I don't care how horrible it is!<eos> We deserve it!<eos> I am the head of this household!<eos> I want him to see the sky!<eos> We will!
Oh, mightiest of Khans...<eos> - Did the fortress fall?<eos> - Allah didn't want it.<eos> - The Poles?<eos> - Victorious.<eos> - Chmielnicki?<eos> - Defeated.<eos> - Tuhay-bey?<eos> - Wounded.<eos> Allah's will.
911 emergency.<eos> What's up?<eos> Holy shit!<eos> They couldn't have been listening.<eos> Hello? They could've been recording it.<eos> Everything we've said would be on tape and they'd know we did it.<eos> What if we were, like, running lines or something?<eos> We could've been rehearsing. They know we're actors.<eos> Okay, there's a good chance no one's found the girl yet.<eos> They will.
I told you, I don't know.<eos> But I'm gonna find him.<eos> Not good enough.<eos> After the kidnapping I was afraid.<eos> I was afraid to go outside, afraid to be alone, afraid to be in a crowd.<eos> I was afraid to do anything at all.<eos> until I realised...<eos> I can't hide in the shadows.<eos> I can't let fear run my Iife.<eos> I won't.
Terry, we're trying to hunt them down. My soldiers are out there.<eos> What more can I do? And if he comes here?<eos> And, what if he does?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, you don't want to tell me about this?<eos> About being here with the bodyguards and everything.<eos> I don't suppose you've ever had anything like enemies.<eos> Well, I never went out for the cheerleading squad, and I never stole anyone's boyfriend that I know of.<eos> So no. I'd like to think not.<eos> You never will.
And Janie.<eos> And Carolyn.<eos> I guess I could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me, but it's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world.<eos> Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much.<eos> My heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst.<eos> And then I remember to relax and stop trying to hold on to it.<eos> And then it flows through me like rain and I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life.<eos> You have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm sure.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> You will someday.
You let me worry about that.<eos> What were you talking about?<eos> Oh, it's nothing that can't wait.<eos> - Any better?<eos> - Buffers are stable.<eos> I wish she were here too, Constable.<eos> If we only knew where Kira was. If we could be sure she was all right.<eos> The Colonel is a survivor.<eos> This war, Captain. It has to end.<eos> And it will. Soon.
He didn't even want you to know.<eos> Why not?<eos> He doesn't wanna be weak in front of you.<eos> He's not weak, he's just scared.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> Doing something when you're scared is what courage is all about.<eos> Sharky... He's one of the bravest guys I know.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> He'll get through this, so will you.<eos> We all will.
All the help I gave you with Natalie.<eos> Is ther e nothing I wouldn't do f or you?<eos> And this is how I'm to be r epaid?<eos> I see you'r e about to cave.<eos> No, I just can't believe how much you sounded like my mother just then.<eos> - - You'll do it?<eos> - - What possible ex cuse can I give f or stopping by her office?<eos> - - You'll think of something.<eos> - - I won't think of something.<eos> - - You will.
- What meeting could I possibly go to?<eos> Tell me you are not showing your face...<eos> I have got my own meeting.<eos> Every week. The downstairs office here at 11:00 p.m.<eos> There are nine of us.<eos> Three senators, two secretaries, one federal judge and two agency directors.<eos> There's an agent outside. It looks like a card game.<eos> - Do I have enemies in that room?<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Neither will anyone else.
Because I have yet to hear any explanation.<eos> Agent Mulder can explain it.<eos> Agent Scully, to an extent.<eos> They might have even prevented what you see in those photos.<eos> Scully and Mulder have been suspended by the FBI.<eos> - also my doing... and my mistake.<eos> - I would ask...<eos> I'd ask, before you say it's not my business, that you do everything you can to get them back on the X-Files.<eos> Far worse can happen.<eos> And it will.
- Listen.<eos> I was nearly dead.<eos> Listen. Her brother Dadan is a war criminal. He'll exterminate our family.<eos> - But she's a midget.<eos> O mirror, the dead with the dead the living with the living, the children with their father.<eos> For two months.<eos> Then you get a divorce.<eos> ...the dead with the dead...<eos> I don't want to marry.<eos> I won't.
Of course it isn't, because it isn't everything.<eos> And we want everything, don't we?<eos> But we still have one thing.<eos> One of our greatest things we'll always have.<eos> You know what that is?<eos> Our dreams.<eos> We can still meet in our dreams.<eos> We can talk to each other there and go for walks together in the summer and in the winter, and in the rain and in the sun and I can come and pick you up and we can go flying.<eos> Nobody's loved you like I do.<eos> Nobody ever will.
What the fuck?<eos> Stay down!<eos> Stay down!<eos> Tie them up, tape them up, hands and face.<eos> On the floor!<eos> Bend over the fucking desk.<eos> Keys.<eos> I want keys. Now!<eos> I'll find you.<eos> Course you will, sweetheart.
A tragic confrontation will ensue.<eos> It should appear to be stupid and spur-of-the-moment.<eos> I've always thought "bludgeon" has a spur-of-the-moment sound.<eos> Maybe you could use one of these.<eos> Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom.<eos> Disable the service entrance lock.<eos> Make it look like it was jimmied.<eos> Put the key back under the pipe, then leave the way you came in.<eos> And what happens if the plan goes to hell?<eos> It won't.
I'll tell you when it's over.<eos> The only way you leave me is dead.<eos> I always thought that "bludgeon" had a spur-of-the-moment sound.<eos> Maybe you could use one of these.<eos> Rifle the jewelry in the bedroom.<eos> Disable the service entrance lock.<eos> Make it look like it was jimmied.<eos> Put the key back under the pipe then leave the same way you came in.<eos> And what happens if the plan goes to hell?<eos> It won't.

I... didn't want to wake him up. It's still a little early.<eos> Can I count on you to do that?<eos> You could always count on me, Mike.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Take care, Jo.<eos> Hey.<eos> Call me.<eos> If you need a lawyer.<eos> I will.<eos> And I will.
Take a good care, inspector Helmer!<eos> No problemo!<eos> Happy birthday!<eos> I'm leaving!<eos> Do you think you can play games with me? !<eos> You don't own me, you Shiptar!<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Who are you?<eos> No!<eos> I won't!
What was I thinking?<eos> In your dreams, pal.<eos> Get the fuck on home.<eos> Oh, uh, I forgot to mention I saw Menzies just around the corner.<eos> I'm sure he'd be game.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Okay, I will.<eos> See ya.<eos> No, you won't.
Uh, okay.<eos> Uh...<eos> Tell me your big tragedy.<eos> What tragedy?<eos> About the girl you loved who ran away or died.<eos> She died.<eos> It's pretty obvious.<eos> Well, people die all over.<eos> You have to put it into perspective.<eos> Soon we all will.
You said if I brought them back their cat...<eos> Was it the oldest?<eos> Was it Prue who sent you away?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Avoid her.<eos> She's the strongest.<eos> You must separate them.<eos> Together they're charmed, impenetrable.<eos> - But what if they don't want me?<eos> - Phoebe will.
Look out!<eos> Gabrielle!<eos> I thought you were different from her.<eos> I thought you had a regard for life, no matter whose.<eos> You're not going to die, Crassus.<eos> I said I'd switch you.<eos> Now if the guards recognize who you are, I have no control over that.<eos> Don't rely on that.<eos> Most of Rome doesn't know what I look like, let alone the prison guards.<eos> You will with this.
-I saw you kiss her.<eos> -Exactly.<eos> I kissed her.<eos> The bet was that she would kiss me, which she didn't.<eos> So I lost.<eos> -In fact, these are yours.<eos> -Oh, no, you don't.<eos> You're setting me up, aren't you?<eos> Playing some sort of angle I don't see.<eos> But I will.
Dorian's right to be concerned, Xena.<eos> Why don't you leave me and go on ahead?<eos> The advance scouts travel a day ahead of the main force..., ...so we still have time.<eos> Be honest with me Xena.<eos> How bad is this poison?<eos> It didn't hit a main artery.<eos> This poultice will delay the effects until we can get to Tripolis and treat it with a serum.<eos> By tomorrow you'll be trying those flips again... with a staff.<eos> -If she dies...<eos> -She won't.
Probably out sewing your wild oats.<eos> Ya make me sick.<eos> Go on, get outta here!<eos> You don't wanna be doing that, Meg.<eos> So, the little virgin wants to play rough, huh?<eos> How'd you like a trip to Mount Olympus, courtesy of my fist?<eos> -Hello, Xena.<eos> -Hello, Meg.<eos> Oh, very well, I will play the part of the wetched lush Meg..., ...but I hardly think anyone will be fooled.<eos> Yes, they will.
I promised Xena I'd switch you for Vercinix!<eos> Then you really are in the middle of it.<eos> I thought you were different from her.<eos> I thought you had a regard for life, no matter whose.<eos> You're not going to die, Crassus.<eos> I said I'd switch you.<eos> Now if the guards recognize who you are, I have no control over that.<eos> Don't rely on that.<eos> Most of Rome doesn't know what I look like, let alone the prison guards.<eos> You will with this.
My first?<eos> Your first kill.<eos> That's what mistakes are for. To learn.<eos> You might even get a little scar if you're lucky.<eos> - How did you know the whale was there?<eos> - You get a sense.<eos> You'll get it too, after a while.<eos> Never take your eye off the ball, Max.<eos> If you do, the sea will get you, or the whale will.<eos> The whale will?
You work for me, Randolph.<eos> You understand that?<eos> I guess you'll have to fire me.<eos> What if I were to order you to ready this boat for immediate departure?<eos> It means you lose your job.<eos> They told me to keep an eye on you.<eos> That is exactly what I'm going to do.<eos> Stevens, where did you put the boat?<eos> - I don't hear anything.<eos> - The whales will.
No, but maybe you could take me with you instead.<eos> Damn, you do start fast, don't you?<eos> I'd really like to go with you now.<eos> And exactly why is that?<eos> I need to show you something.<eos> Slow down.<eos> - Girl, don't hit the gas like that!<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> You really need to see this.<eos> I will. One thing.
Value.<eos> The value of what we had between us is short by 10,000 guineas.<eos> Is money everything?<eos> It is to you, Jane.<eos> The minute you found a lord, you lifted your skirt and fell on your back.<eos> What's your favor?<eos> Do not ask him to sell the estate.<eos> I've already asked him and he's already promised me.<eos> - He will not do it.<eos> - He will.
- You the Press Office? - Yes. Earn your money.<eos> Play he's sick.<eos> When do we bring him back?<eos> I'm gonna need a day. At least a day. He's sick.<eos> Get that out right now. Get them on the phone and tell the jackals how sick he is.<eos> We gotta get that out before the story breaks. We have to correspond to it. Issue a bulletin.<eos> He's got some rare strain... - Won't hold.<eos> - I need a day.<eos> I need some running time. It won't hold a day, Connie.<eos> Yes, it will.
Yes.<eos> How about some breakfast?<eos> I was just gonna make some.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Well?<eos> Leon....<eos> What's going on?<eos> There's only two of us now.<eos> Then we're stupid and we'll die.<eos> No, we won't.
- At nine?<eos> At nine.<eos> It's gonna be fun.<eos> Buffy!<eos> Did, uh, Angel...<eos> He told me everything.<eos> When Angel came to my room, he was just really concerned for you.<eos> We didn't wanna say anything in case we were wrong.<eos> Did you find out what Ford is up to?<eos> I will.
Did she ask for me?<eos> She was in shock.<eos> She couldn't talk.<eos> Was she in pain?<eos> She's gone, Phil.<eos> Let it go.<eos> She was my wife.<eos> And I got a right to know how she died.<eos> She died alone.<eos> Just like you and I will.
Give us murder two?<eos> He's gonna give us murder two.<eos> Your client's fingerprints were found on two different weapons, one jammed.<eos> He formed intent going for the second while the kid was running away.<eos> That's your theory.<eos> He fled the scene.<eos> It's an admission of guilt.<eos> It's also your theory.<eos> I'd love to hear yours.<eos> - You will.
Look, the king and his daughter are only here for 72 hours.<eos> Now, during that time, she'll be attending numerous official functions.<eos> In a significant political gesture, an American Naval officer has been chosen to be her escort.<eos> An American Naval officer.<eos> You, to be precise.<eos> Admiral, respectfully, I'm a lawyer.<eos> And a Naval officer who has been chosen for escort duty by the secretary of the Navy.<eos> Sir, she should have Secret Service protection.<eos> Those guys are trained for this sort of thing.<eos> She will, commander.
He's probably having a cigar out on the balcony.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Our people have been fed so much propaganda over the years that providing an American Naval base will not be easy.<eos> No, princess, I imagine not.<eos> There are many details that'll have to be worked out before one of your ships can even visit us.<eos> Well, I'm sure Mr. Webb will be most accommodating.<eos> He already has been.<eos> I've requested that you be on the American delegation as legal representative, and Mr. Webb agreed.<eos> It would be an honour, princess.<eos> Yes, it will, commander.
You know, Dukat, I thought you'd changed in the last five years.<eos> I see I was wrong.<eos> One man's villain is another man's hero, Captain.<eos> You should see the monument they're erecting in my honor at the gateway to the Imperial Plaza.<eos> Is that why you sold out your people to the Dominion? For a monument?<eos> ! What I did... I did to make Cardassia strong again.<eos> And mark my words, Captain, I succeeded.<eos> You may have escaped defeat this day but tomorrow...<eos> We will see about tomorrow.<eos> Yes, we will.
Take care.<eos> You're an actor now.<eos> Can 2 people who want to save mankind marry?<eos> Of course.<eos> Can they still save mankind, when they have children?<eos> Of course they can!<eos> Two heads are better than one!<eos> Kids need looking after.<eos> They'll have no time for others.<eos> Yes, they will.
Would you excuse me for a moment? Of course.<eos> Did you see any Pah-wraiths?<eos> Pah-wraiths?<eos> In the Fire Caves. Odo was telling me the Caves were haunted by some sort of weird supernatural beings.<eos> Don't tell me you believe in wraiths.<eos> Well, I may have mentioned the Bajoran legends about creatures living in the caves but I never said I believe in them.<eos> Well, the only thing I saw in the caves were some beautiful and botanically fascinating fungi.<eos> Well, maybe the next time you go to the Fire Caves, I could come along.<eos> I've always wanted to meet a Pah-wraith.<eos> Maybe you will.
Gabrielle, get your staff ready.<eos> Centaurs?<eos> No.<eos> You want it?<eos> You've got it.<eos> Centaurs!<eos> Retreat!<eos> Xena... Destroyer of nations.<eos> You promised you'd never return.<eos> That Xena never will.
Child?<eos> I didn't see no child.<eos> The one you're carrying.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I might be crazy, but you know it is possible.<eos> But that can't be.<eos> I mean, I can't.<eos> I can't have a child.<eos> You will, in the spring.
- That is not true.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Honey, honey...<eos> You must lighten up on her.<eos> She is almost an adult.<eos> We do not Want to lose another kid.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I know.<eos> We are going to beat this.<eos> Maybe not in this lifetime. But We will.
All we have to do is persuade grandpa.<eos> You know it has to be torn down in a few years.<eos> I'll decide on that,<eos> I'm against it.<eos> Would you please sit down?<eos> Sit down and listen.<eos> I got your point.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Will my opposing it change anything?<eos> No, it won't,
Take him to ore processing.<eos> Remind him where he belongs.<eos> - What about Sisko?<eos> - Take me to the lntendant's quarters.<eos> She'll decide what to do with me.<eos> - Of all the impudent...<eos> - Do as he says.<eos> Intendant, I demand that this man be... You... demand?<eos> You promised me he'd die.<eos> And he will...
I performed the autopsy on him this morning.<eos> So I guess it's true you can never go home again!<eos> His body wounds were nonfatal.<eos> He died as a result of advanced cirrhosis of the liver.<eos> Oh, there's a moral to this story!<eos> "Lay off the booze."<eos> Well, his body possesses some anatomical discrepancies.<eos> Offshoots of the oesophagus and trachea that almost seem umbilical in nature. I...<eos> - I've never seen anything like it.<eos> - And you never will again.
Is it me you're after?<eos> Do you want me?<eos> -Stop it.<eos> Is it me you want?<eos> -Please, stop it.<eos> Stop it, I'm exhausted.<eos> Let me through.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Come on.<eos> -No, I won't. Not now.
Cheung.<eos> - He doesn't want us to find him.<eos> - That's for sure.<eos> So what's going on?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Where's the money?<eos> - Shh.<eos> Try to show some patience, all right?<eos> - If I wait much longer, they'll discover me.<eos> - No, they won't.
- Would you like mine?<eos> - I said I don't!<eos> Then wait...<eos> Mr. Di Cosimo, shall I empty all the water? - All of it, all of it.<eos> - All right.<eos> 'Morning. Good morning.<eos> Mr. Di Cosimo... what can I do to thank you?<eos> Your wreath was the nicest. Nothing, Donna Rosa. Just vote and get others to vote.<eos> Remember to use that little pencil of yours<eos> And hopefully some of your customers will, too.
I just don't know if that sounds very realistic.<eos> What sounds realistic?<eos> A month stone-cold sober, that doesn't sound realistic?<eos> I can't just tell Jordan Catalano something like that.<eos> God. Angela, think of it.<eos> We'd have such a time.<eos> You, hanging out with the band.<eos> Me, being the band.<eos> - Come on, he'll do it if you ask him.<eos> - No, he won't.
Don't you know?<eos> You're why I came back.<eos> This is Westin.<eos> They battened down the hatches.<eos> There's no clear shot from this side.<eos> What about you guys?<eos> Ditto. Hold your positions.<eos> How do we look?<eos> Backup's in but we still don't know what's going on in there.<eos> We will soon enough.
You're gonna miss graduation.<eos> Aaron, you know...<eos> Of course I wanna be there.<eos> Seeing you getting your diploma.<eos> But I have no choice.<eos> I have to be in Davenport first thing Monday morning.<eos> You can see Sullivan!<eos> Hey, I wanna give him some marbles.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
Prakash! What are you doing?<eos> Put me down!<eos> What if dad comes in?<eos> - He won't
- Saving your life.<eos> So you chose your uniform over me after all.<eos> No. My time here with you has meant so much, but it's over.<eos> It's time we went on with our lives.<eos> You say you're my friend.<eos> Prove it.<eos> Use that weapon on me.<eos> I can't.<eos> If I leave here, I'll die.<eos> No, you won't.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!<eos> YOU GOTTA FIX IT!<eos> OR WHAT?<eos> YOU GOTTA HELP ME.<eos> IT'S ALEX THAT DID THIS.<eos> GOD DAMN.<eos> I CAN'T STOP WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE ME.<eos> I'LL PAY, MAN.<eos> I WILL PAY.<eos> YES, OF COURSE, YOU WILL.
Please come in.<eos> This is my wife Loretta, and these are the Odones.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm so happy you were able to come.<eos> Because I think a lot of it is denial.<eos> We don't want to say anything's going on.<eos> We're strong and we can handle it.<eos> But this is the place and this is the time to let it all out,... let the barriers come down... and to share your feelings and get it off your chest.<eos> It's hard to believe that things can get worse.<eos> But they will.
Please.<eos> If he's gonna be in this family, you ought to see these guys.<eos> You really should.<eos> This monster I got when I was an undergraduate at Virginia.<eos> See his little tail?<eos> I stood in front of the mirror in their upstairs guest room... looking out over the yard and the little tent and the food which had been catered.<eos> I felt a certain kinship with these people- the caterers.<eos> Don't look.<eos> It's badluck.<eos> All right, I won't.
I'm too worried about you.<eos> With Arthur letting you down the way he has. How will you cope?<eos> Like you said, you can't rule Camelot alone.<eos> I have you by my side.<eos> Oh! I may be your Queen, but I have no power.<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, the people wouldn't respect me as they do Arthur.<eos> I'm not heir to the throne.<eos> Would it put your mind at rest if you were?<eos> It most definitely would.
And he said he was gonna break my glasses.<eos> He scared me, and I threw my book at him.<eos> And the state's recommendation?<eos> One year probation and 200 hours of community service. Mm-hm.<eos> You caused some serious injuries, Mr. Ramsey.<eos> Broken eye socket, stitches.<eos> The other child is recovering quite well, Your Honor.<eos> Break a nose and your punishment is picking up trash?<eos> - What's the lesson there?<eos> - Your Honor, I would just...
-I stake my reputation on it.<eos> -Well, that's not much.<eos> -The media are outside.<eos> -Then I will announce<eos> -that we have solved the case.<eos> -I wouldn't.<eos> -I will.<eos> -I wouldn't do it.<eos> -I am going to.<eos> -I wouldn't.
He wants editorial control.<eos> Brent Barrow shouldn't be in control of the air-conditioning.<eos> Do you want to go to the Hollywood Gold Awards with me?<eos> Sure.<eos> What is this thing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just want to be with you.<eos> Me too.<eos> Lucy Spiller, would you like to go on a date with me?<eos> Yes, I would.
We've been trying to get her for years.<eos> She's senior intelligence.<eos> Uses her body like Mata Hari.<eos> I mean, I would have to be forced.<eos> I would consider...<eos> I would definitely give her one.<eos> - You and a few others.<eos> - You would as well, would you?<eos> - Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> - I would, yeah.
- Ma'am.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Can't complain.<eos> I wanna thank you again for helping us out.<eos> It's just for a day or two.<eos> Well, it means a lot to us.<eos> After what happened yesterday, I feel a lot safer with you here.<eos> You do.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Who wouldn't?
They're willing to move, but they have a list of demands a mile and a half long.<eos> And negotiating with alien settlements is not exactly why I joined the Air Force.<eos> We were hoping if you had some time, maybe...<eos> You'd save us a lot of time in the back and forth.<eos> I'll free up my afternoon.<eos> Appreciate that, Colonel.<eos> Jennifer, Rodney.<eos> I'll meet you at the Gate in one hour.<eos> I was rather hoping you'd go by yourself,<eos> - and I wouldn't...
Yeah, it's the new wave in fashion-forwardlaw enforcement.<eos> mary, they're keeping me here against my will.<eos> Will you tell this moron I have diplomaticimmunity?<eos> kay, sweetie, I'm sure detective dershowitzhas a very good reason for keeping you here.<eos> Detective,is my friend kay under arrest?<eos> No, not so far.<eos> Though shooting herhas crossed my mind.<eos> Either of youwant coffee?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - I'd absolutelylove a cup.
Anything that guy would do to keep a long-term op intact?<eos> Nope.<eos> Anything he wouldn't say tohut this down before it got too loud?<eos> That night... at her house, Jenny gave her gun to the Frog.<eos> You have the bullets.<eos> Take the damn gun!<eos> Protect yourself.<eos> She did.<eos> And that would explain how it got to the yacht.<eos> It would.
In a sleazy, scammy sort of way.<eos> I guess i have amanda to thank for that.<eos> So i guess you wouldn't mind working with her again?<eos> Oh. Um... i don't know about that.<eos> Because i gotta tell you, this story is gonna make<eos> An excellent regular feature on our web site.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Having some new kind of crazy adventure. You have a great dynamic.<eos> But i could probably float you an advance If it sweetens the deal and helps pay your rent.<eos> Oh, it would. It would.
Oh? Could it wait till this evening, Fanny?<eos> I was just going out.<eos> - Where, may I ask?<eos> - To meet Mrs. Gowan.<eos> That is just what I wanted to mention to you.<eos> Now, you may not realise it, dear, but you're letting us all down again.<eos> You've turned yourself into a nursemaid for that Gowan family and it's reflecting upon us.<eos> You'll have everybody thinking you're a common servant!<eos> - Would it be so bad if they did?<eos> - Yes, it would.
- OK.<eos> - And I think it would be best if you didn't see my daughter again.<eos> - Um, you speaking as my doctor or as her father?<eos> - Jordan tells me that you're the young man that brought her home the other night.<eos> - I am.<eos> - It seems to me that whenever you two get together, someone becomes separated from his senses.<eos> You're obviously a bad influence on her.<eos> - I'm a bad influence on her?<eos> - Would you disagree?<eos> - No, sir, I would not.
It is obvious that you are using.<eos> One can experiment from time to time. I mean, God knows I have done my share. You should know that I planned on... giving you my highest recommendation.<eos> I appreciate it, sir.<eos> No doubt.<eos> What're gonna be doing for the holidays?<eos> Actually I plan on spending it with Gwen's family.<eos> That's good. Opportunity to re-think your priorities.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And a little time away from Dr. Gallo wouldn't hurt either.<eos> No, it wouldn't.
There's a pie in my oven.<eos> Oh, uh, that's mine.<eos> I was practicing. It smells like cheese.<eos> Is it quiche?<eos> I baked monastery gouda into the cru... tart apple filling.<eos> I thought i'd try it.<eos> You know what would be delicious?<eos> Pear with gruy?<eos> e crust. Bet that'd be real good.<eos> Yeah, it would.
- Where we going?<eos> - Just go.<eos> At least you know it works.<eos> Your doctoral thesis was on the origins of the universe, right?<eos> - The first one.<eos> - Hey, is this the new kid?<eos> Who you calling kid, Spartacus?<eos> - Cocky.<eos> I like him.<eos> - You would.
- No?<eos> No?<eos> Well, what did you mean?<eos> Sorry I'm not the man with the megaphone, this is what I do.<eos> You could at least hear what he has to say.<eos> I suppose you don't, because you're never gonna be drafted.<eos> Nor will you, Lucy.<eos> I would lie down in front of a tank, if it would stop this war and bring Max home.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, it wouldn't.
Just let yourself in.<eos> I'll be right out.<eos> Good evening, Willy.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's... really... really, really nice of you.<eos> A simple "no, thank you"... is the preferred etiquette when declining a gift.<eos> It takes a very special sort of person... to look into someone's eyes and shoot them, Willy.<eos> A certain kind of strength... if you know what I mean.<eos> Well, I guess you'd know that, wouldn't you?<eos> Oh, yes, I would.
How would you react?<eos> I know Smokey a little bit.<eos> He's too nice a gentleman ever to say such a thing.<eos> Dylan might.<eos> Dylan would, actually.<eos> In fact, Dylan did.<eos> Okay, Dylan walks up to you and he says, "You are a horrible songwriter."<eos> - How do you react?<eos> - I would be horribly depressed. Yes.<eos> I would.
- Oh, whatever.<eos> This is my future brother-in-law, Patrick.<eos> Patrick, this is my sister, Elise.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> You are beautiful.<eos> - Whoa, there.<eos> - Well, you're not bad yourself.<eos> Well, perhaps you'd like me to show you around?<eos> Perhaps I would.
No one can make any trouble if the noble Cicero is backing me.<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> No?<eos> Not that I do not wish to help you... as a friend.<eos> But the Senate would know I was backing you Only through fear of death.<eos> Oh, I understand.<eos> You do not want to seem cowardly.<eos> Tell them I bribed you.<eos> Would you accept a bribe?<eos> I would not.
Motel 6 lobby and my color printer.<eos> No one can know we're goingto see my real mom.<eos> We have to be perfect.<eos> Your father looks angry.<eos> My father always looks angry.<eos> But your sister looks hot.<eos> For this you leave your job,take an unauthorized vacation.<eos> Gorge yourself on hamvurgers and waffles.<eos> Waffles are very good,You would like them.<eos> No,Hiro.I would not.
It's just sometimes it feels really overwhelming.<eos> I know, but you got to let me back in.<eos> - I want to.<eos> I do.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> You were thinking about making a dollhouse for Martha?<eos> She'd really like that, wouldn't she?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She would.
It's an anniversary present for nina.<eos> See, it's -- it's a diamond key to my heart.<eos> It's -- it's a key, but, you s, it's shaped like a heart.<eos> You can't tell me that it looks like anything else,'cause that's what it is.<eos> That's it.That's what I like.<eos> And I'm not gonna take it back.<eos> It's perfect, angel.<eos> She'll love it.<eos> Really?<eos> I would.
Ew.<eos> Oh, God, Jenna.<eos> I told you, don't listen to rumors.<eos> But Frank and Toofer said to me--<eos> Frank and Toofer?<eos> That's where you're getting your information?<eos> They're messing with you!<eos> No.<eos> They wouldn't do that to me.<eos> Yeah, they would.
I'm not particularly fond of that side of myself.<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> When you see an opportunity, you take it.<eos> With the kind of things that you and me were asked to do, that you're doing now,<eos> I mean, you've got to be a little angry, you've got to be out of control.<eos> I mean, if you think too much, you're just gonna freeze up.<eos> My God, you... are going to other planets through a freaking wormhole!<eos> You have be a little nuts.<eos> I just don't want to screw up again.<eos> Well, you'd better not.
There's a difference.<eos> I wish you'd get a life.<eos> I wish you would.<eos> Yes, I know you do.<eos> Toby, I'm telling you, that's the number.<eos> You've gotta believe me.<eos> Oh, come on, Toby, don't be like that. We're friends. Aren't we friends?<eos> Well, I like you.<eos> Look, would you believe it if Heck told you?<eos> You would?
Whatever. I'll think of something and then walk out.<eos> I'll be waiting with champagne.<eos> How much do I wish it was just us tonight.<eos> He'll definitely be into her, right?<eos> - Coop?<eos> He'll fancy Luce?<eos> - She's got a pulse, hasn't she?<eos> No, but, I mean...<eos> You do.<eos> You would?
- No, that's not it.<eos> Well, what else do you have?<eos> I have confidential sources, Ms. Reed.<eos> First day on the job, you've got confidential sources?<eos> And what do those sources tell you, hmm?<eos> That even though no body's been found, they think this is a murder, with husband Henry prime suspect.<eos> They even have a nice, juicy motive.<eos> Which is?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Two cops shot, four dead perps, and perhaps the biggest gun battle in the history of the NYPD.<eos> You took their statements?<eos> Uh, yes, sir.<eos> It's right there.<eos> And you're satisfied that all's in order?<eos> I, um... I'm still investigating...<eos> You said that looked justified.<eos> So far.<eos> Lieutenant Swersky, you mind if I talk to Sergeant here alone?<eos> Actually, Captain, I would.
So if from now on you could just stick to the curriculum, that would be great.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Ros?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - Do you know, I would really love to talk some more about your philosophy on teaching.<eos> Do you think maybe we could grab some coffee?<eos> You want to go get some coffee with me?<eos> Yeah. I really would.
Family, friends...<eos> But he was absolutely thrilled to be in Madrid.<eos> Back then, Alicia and I were living in the building and I invited him to move in.<eos> Alfredo!<eos> Alfredo!<eos> Alfredo!<eos> Yes, you can. Please, tell me.<eos> -What for?<eos> It'd make no difference.<eos> -Yes, it would.
When she was alive, I had to scour for anything I could find... with a dragonfly on it to buy her a present.<eos> Now?<eos> Now I see 'em everywhere. There was one - There was one bouncing against my office window yesterday.<eos> A real one. She had bought over the Internet... a mobile to put on the baby's crib... of dragonflies.<eos> And then this thing last night with the paperweight.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you are literally going buggy living in that house.<eos> Yeah, you should move.<eos> You're rummaging around in an empty nursery. You're living with a talking parrot who won't even speak to you.<eos> Never would.
How long were you there?<eos> A colleague suspected... and... cruise Next to me was... and here I am.<eos> My God!<eos> I wanted to kill you for real?<eos> I wanted out of life because he has another lover.<eos> Is with him now?<eos> I do not know.<eos> What is happening here?<eos> Just know that when tried to kill me... had intentions of continue the romance.<eos> With whom would the novel?
OPEN HEARTS<eos> Would you like a sweet?<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> Not at all?<eos> - What's up?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I just thought maybe you'd like a sweet.<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
All right, Oz.<eos> Now that Kevin told us, what about you?<eos> You haven't had the slightest bit of attraction to any girl at school?<eos> Don't you fuckin' say no. I know you did.<eos> Even if I did... it wouldn't be anything more than just a momentary thing.<eos> Very uninteresting.<eos> How about you,Jessica?<eos> How many chicks did you sleep with this year?<eos> Gee, wouldn't you like to know.<eos> Fuckyeah, I would.
Why were you kicked out of the police force?<eos> I slept with the boss' wife.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm not married and I'm determined to motivate you, Brenner.<eos> Between you and me, I want to be frank with you.<eos> Watzek Concrete paid... for the Rettungsbund's entire fleet.<eos> So to prove they need all these new vehicles, the Bund has waged war on us.<eos> They intercept radio communications, steal patients.<eos> How would you react to this sort of provocation?<eos> I wouldn't.
It was about you.<eos> Maybe I tried too hard.<eos> I didn't want to miss my chance to dance with you to make you remember what it was like between us.<eos> I thought maybe, you know if I could make it perfect, then....<eos> That I would pick you?<eos> Say it, Dawson. You thought if you orchestrated this whole evening that I'd be convinced into picking you over Pacey, right?<eos> You have to pick somebody, Joey.<eos> I just wanted to remind you what you'd be missing if you didn't pick me.<eos> You'd be missing a lot.<eos> And so would I.
