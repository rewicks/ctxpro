It was like... He waited to see me.<eos> We synaptic scanned you.<eos> Everything you witnessed went to Section 9 to evaluate.<eos> You know, the scan... Also turned up the number of glitches.<eos> They've been getting worse.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since the deep dive.<eos> Do any of the glitches mean something to you?<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
No voices.<eos> No data streaming.<eos> Just... nothing.<eos> - It scares me.<eos> - Then Why do you do it?<eos> It feels real.<eos> Why didn't you stop him?<eos> I don't know who to trust anymore.<eos> You trust me, right?<eos> Yes I do.
You're late!<eos> Just in time, boss.<eos> They bust in here, step on our throats, and take the one device that can cause a global power shift.<eos> So, how do we get it back?<eos> These assholes just took out the best of the best like it was Sunday brunch.<eos> We need someone who can move like them, fight like them.<eos> We need someone who can walk into a tornado, and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze.<eos> You know someone like that?<eos> No.<eos> But Gibbons did.
Well, welcome back, Triple-X.<eos> Uh, where are you going?<eos> - London. - Why?<eos> What's in London?<eos> A ghost hunter.<eos> And possibly my fur coat.<eos> I'd forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.<eos> Oh, I, uh, see you found your coat.<eos> Well, you promised to take care of it for me.<eos> And I did.
Megan-Ann.<eos> Okay. I will not forget.<eos> I should have married Leroy while I had the chance.<eos> Leroy knew where to put his hands.<eos> Ah, you're the killer, Nyung.<eos> Don't deny it, you shit.<eos> It's hard to put down a good book.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who doesn't love to read books?<eos> I do, as a normal person.
I never did like you, not even as a child.<eos> Teddy Millner, did you dump this girl immediately after she told you she was pregnant?<eos> Okay-<eos> You didn't tell them what you said.<eos> Wait, what did you say?<eos> What did I say?<eos> She said that we'd be ridiculous parents.<eos> No, I...<eos> Not like that.<eos> Yes, you did.
It's not fair.<eos> The Jerry I married loved me.<eos> Yeah, that's what I thought.<eos> We're ridiculous.<eos> We're ridiculous?<eos> Yeah, everyone is ridiculous, Jerry!<eos> Okay?<eos> You deal with it 'cause you have to!<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah, you do!
- All right.<eos> Okay. Ready?<eos> Wait, Summer, do you have time to study later?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you just look at my boobs?<eos> I...<eos> Was not my intention.<eos> I didn't stare directly at them.<eos> You're looking at them right now.<eos> Now I did.
We watch when other people don't want to watch.<eos> We protect when other people don't want to protect.<eos> If we do the bare minimum, sometimes people die.<eos> Guys, we have flakka that just washed ashore.<eos> That shit is hardcore and it fucking kills people.<eos> And now we got a dead body in our bay.<eos> And the girls on that boat had the same drugs on them that I found in front of Leeds's club.<eos> So my gut says that it's all connected.<eos> Wait, Leeds did say there'd be an open house tonight, right?<eos> Yes, she did.
- For Mitch.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Lifeguards, this is a surprise.<eos> - Oh, hi!<eos> Victoria, we wanted to come here in person and tell you how excited we are to be working with you instead of against you, now that...<eos> - Now that...<eos> - Mitch is gone.<eos> He's gone, so all we care about now is protecting the bay.<eos> And we know you feel the same.<eos> I do.
Until then...<eos> Go, baby.<eos> I'm oceanic, motherfucker.<eos> How tacky.<eos> - Mitch, you just blew her up!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Plus I'm high as a motherfucker right now on Devil's Urchin.<eos> You stabbed yourself with one of those?<eos> I thought that was supposed to kill you.<eos> It does.
Also in the garden.<eos> In the quarry.<eos> I assume it's his mother he hears or thinks he hears.<eos> - It seems to give him comfort.<eos> - I should have been told.<eos> It changes the situation.<eos> It may indicate a far more serious condition.<eos> You don't believe in such voices?<eos> No.<eos> - No, signore, I do not. - Nor do I.
Do the kids at school ever make fun of you for the way that you talk?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> You can do something about that.<eos> You know, you can learn to talk differently.<eos> But this is my voice.<eos> How will kids even know it's me talking?<eos> When I was in the fifth grade, this girl used to sing this song.<eos> She smells like manure and she lived in the sewer<eos> Samantha Kingston<eos> Who did that?
Man, he loves you.<eos> But no matter how much he looked for food in there, he never found anything.<eos> And he looked.<eos> A lot.<eos> Summer's ending.<eos> Best summer ever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't want to go back to school.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I do?
But now...<eos> Now there's someone to remember me when I'm gone.<eos> It's Grandpa Wilson, right there!<eos> At least until some horrific apocalypse wipes out the human race. Hi.<eos> Can you hold him up a little closer?<eos> We like our stories to end with the promise of hope.<eos> Happily ever after and all that.<eos> Is that as clear as it gets?<eos> Too bad real lives don't have that structure.<eos> Or, hell, maybe they do.
Well, I borrowed it from his big, silly mate after Back Lack put an arrow through his lard-loving thigh.<eos> Get back!<eos> That's your story, Jack.<eos> I am leaving.<eos> But I'm leaving with a year's wages.<eos> Old Greybeard surrendered his dignity.<eos> Lucy got a year's worth of wages.<eos> And the rebel graffiti exists no more because of the law-abiding, proactive Blue Boy and his fun-loving dad.<eos> And then, they all lived happily ever after.<eos> No, they didn't, Arthur.

Hard to work when you got to worry about money.<eos> You know you have to do yourself a favor.<eos> What is that?<eos> You know you have to stop drinking.<eos> I mean, you gotta stop it cold.<eos> You could be a great writer.<eos> But your stories are not good enough, and it's because of your drinking.<eos> You know, I think you just need a good idea to jumpstart your career.<eos> You know, I was thinking this morning, I got an idea.<eos> - Of course you do.
You have been here three days.<eos> First you put a knife to my throat, then a gun to my head.<eos> And maybe I am crazy, too, because why I didn't toss you out day one, is baffling to me.<eos> You still don't get it, do you, Paul?<eos> I'm the one writing the story.<eos> I mean, I gave you your chance until you had that brilliant idea to open the door.<eos> It's your fault the sheriff's dead.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I didn't kill anybody.<eos> You did! You did!
Oh, Jeffrey's home?<eos> What a shock.<eos> Okay, don't start!<eos> What?<eos> Agoraphobia is not a joke.<eos> Mama, mama, mama... oh.<eos> Hey, em.<eos> I thought you were mom, 'cause you guys have, like, the exact same voice.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, we don't.
I hope your insurance was paid up.<eos> What, is there even a policy for something like that?<eos> Hey, I told you not to do that, Orchid.<eos> Use a bloody door.<eos> I am glad to see you are well.<eos> - How new is this one?<eos> - Not what you think.<eos> It's the magic of the House.<eos> Decided it wanted to experience humanity and gave itself a body.<eos> It sure did.
All right.<eos> You too, young man.<eos> Don't let the omelet touch the fruit.<eos> She likes a separation.<eos> You do this every day?<eos> - Every day.<eos> - No shit.<eos> Yes shit.<eos> I wish my dad did this for me.<eos> So does your daughter.
- What kinda safe am I hitting?<eos> Keller 9000.<eos> If he has the account data, it will be in there.<eos> You are a very clever girl, Ms. holm.<eos> I know.<eos> FBI.<eos> Mr. valecross, how do you do?<eos> I'm special agent John Henry fernack.<eos> I understand you have information from you regarding the assets of...<eos> - no, I don't.
I thought that blew up rather nicely.<eos> Shall we set the exchange?<eos> The girl for the money?<eos> I need a bit more time.<eos> So why don't you send the girl home to mum as a sign of goodwill, and Patricia and I will keep looking for the money.<eos> You know I can't release her without cash in hand.<eos> Let's say 24 hours, and she dies.<eos> Tell Patricia I say "hello."<eos> Rayt marius says "hello."<eos> Does he?
- Dad, leave it. - "Leave it"?<eos> I don't want to fucking leave it!<eos> What if I don't want to fucking leave it?<eos> What you gonna do about that, eh?<eos> Tell you what... Free pop.<eos> - No, Frank!<eos> - Shut it.<eos> Come on. Stick one on then, you Cunt.<eos> Take a fucking swipe at me. Do it.<eos> Do it!
I want much more than this provincial life<eos> I want adventure in the great wide somewhere<eos> I want it more than I can tell<eos> And for once it might be grand<eos> To have someone understand<eos> I want so much more Than they've got planned<eos> The woods are lovely.<eos> I only wish I recognized them.<eos> Do you know where we are, Philippe?<eos> Because I don't.
Monsieur LeFou.<eos> He was there.<eos> He saw it all.<eos> Me?<eos> You're right.<eos> Don't take my word for it.<eos> LeFou... my dearest companion... did I... your oldest friend and most loyal compatriot... try to kill the father of the only woman I've ever loved?<eos> Well, it's a complicated question on a number of accounts...<eos> But no.<eos> No, he did not.
- Get back. Get back.<eos> Get back.<eos> Uncuff me.<eos> - Uncuff him. - Get back!<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I did not kill that girl!<eos> It was an accident!<eos> And my wife and my son are out there!<eos> - Hey, Kevin, I believe you.<eos> - No, you don't.
- All right.<eos> - Should not have problems.<eos> - Great.<eos> Kit's in the fifth, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> All right. In the seventh...<eos> Hi.<eos> How are you?<eos> Come on!<eos> Do it!
I'll tell you right now. The worst thing a godfather can tell you.<eos> There's a game I can get you into.<eos> It's my old game.<eos> The stakes are very strong.<eos> You can make lots of money very fast.<eos> But you can also lose much as fast.<eos> Yes?<eos> I must tell you.<eos> Believe me that, from what you told me, if you lose, you will have to leave the city.<eos> Do not... yes.
Is it true they had to pull bits of phone outta your brain?<eos> - Left most of it in there, I think.<eos> - Mate, I am... I am glad you ain't a vegetable.<eos> - Thanks, Danny.<eos> - Wait, I know you're not going to school.<eos> - I thought I might.<eos> - Head trauma is wasted on you, mate.<eos> Danny, can I ask you something?<eos> I don't know anything about it.<eos> No one on the estate does.
Now, I want you to ask yourself one very important question.<eos> "Where, oh, where is Lucy?"<eos> You see her, don't you?<eos> She's got nothing to do with any of this.<eos> That's entirely up to you.<eos> I don't like this.<eos> Next time, get a note from your fucking mom or something.<eos> - I can't kill no girl.<eos> - It ain't gonna come to that!<eos> - Yeah, what if it does?
I know you teachers all like to stick together.<eos> I get it.<eos> But I'm having to fire whole departments.<eos> That's hard on me, too.<eos> Wait, whole departments?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Entire departments.<eos> Well, uh, I mean...<eos> Maybe the best thing to do is talk to Neil?<eos> Oh, I did.
Why?<eos> What?<eos> Dogs can't smell molly.<eos> What did you do?<eos> What do you mean, what did I do?<eos> I didn't know they can't smell molly.<eos> Campbell, you have to train a dog to smell specific drugs, okay?<eos> How do you think this thing works?<eos> I don't know how it works. I thought you guys knew how it worked.<eos> We do.
I was consoling her.<eos> Yes, as her mother!<eos> Which you are not.<eos> She said that I was going to abandon her, Cora.<eos> She said this straight to my face.<eos> I'm sorry, we don't know anything about this woman.<eos> We don't know what she's capable of.<eos> I'm sorry, we don't know enough about her past.<eos> - We know she's fled an abusive marriage.<eos> - Yes, yes, we do.
Help is on its way, come on, come on!<eos> Let's play ball, compadres!<eos> On the ground!<eos> Hands up, now!<eos> - Hey, hey!<eos> I am security.<eos> - On your knees!<eos> - All right!<eos> - He has a weapon.<eos> - No, no, I don't.
- Aggy, stop.<eos> Please.<eos> You know he tricked me.<eos> He blackmailed me.<eos> Not even Orlov of the FSB knew what he was unleashing with Barofski.<eos> This wasn't how it was supposed to finish.<eos> I never agreed to any of this.<eos> Then don't do it.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I mean, he obviously wants both of us out of the way.<eos> We only have two things in common.<eos> I mean, we both protect the city and...<eos> It's been a long time since we had that in common.<eos> It's a great conversation starter, though.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen, Muerte... he's on a roll.<eos> Who's he working with?<eos> I thought you and Erlik had an "agreement"?<eos> We do.
Great, now the whole world's gonna know.<eos> Who's our lucky winners tonight?<eos> This is not good, Lisa.<eos> Do tell.<eos> Someone took out the whole crew. Even Erlik.<eos> - Erlik?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> - Dead sure.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Neither did I.
Hello, Red.<eos> You're not entirely disappointing.<eos> Look at you, trying to figure out my plan.<eos> I will just tell you.<eos> Yellow has led you to your death. Because I'm going to kill you... one by one, until you tell me... Where's my crystal.<eos> We don't know.<eos> No, Red.<eos> You don't know!<eos> But guess what.<eos> One of you does.
He's king around here.<eos> He's God to these people.<eos> Kong's a pretty good king.<eos> Keeps to himself mostly.<eos> This is his home.<eos> We're just guests here.<eos> But you don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs unless you're picking a fight.<eos> Wasn't Kong the one who killed your friend?<eos> No.<eos> One of them did.
Tell me about your morning.<eos> Start from the beginning.<eos> I woke up.<eos> How did you sleep?<eos> I didn't.
- Ask him.<eos> Why fixate on Culverton Smith?<eos> He's had his obsessions before, of course. But this goes a bit further than setting a man trap for Father Christmas.<eos> Do it. Ask him.<eos> Spending all night talking to a woman who wasn't even there. Shut up, you.<eos> -Mycroft, last time when we were on the phone...<eos> No, no, no, stop.<eos> I detest conversation in the past tense.<eos> You said the fact that you're his brother made no difference.<eos> It doesn't.
That's all it was, it was a smile.<eos> We texted constantly.<eos> You want to know when?<eos> Every time you left the room, that's when.<eos> When you're feeding our daughter. When you were stopping her from crying, that's when.<eos> That's all it was.<eos> Just texting.<eos> But I wanted more.<eos> And you know something?<eos> I still do.
I mean obviously, normal and fine are both relative terms when it comes to Sherlock and Mycroft.<eos> Obviously.<eos> She was real.<eos> But, I didn't mean Mycroft. I mean the other one.<eos> Which other one?<eos> You know, the secret one.<eos> That was just something... I said. I'm sure there's...<eos> How did you know about that, I didn't tell you that.<eos> - You must have done.<eos> - I really didn't.
No, I know you're not an experiment. You're my friend.<eos> We're friends. But... Please, just say those words for me.<eos> Please don't do this. Just...<eos> Just don't do it.<eos> It's very important. I can't say why. But I promise you, it is.<eos> I can't say that. I can't... I can't say that to you.<eos> Of course you can. Why can't you?<eos> You know why.<eos> - No, I don't know why.<eos> Of course you do.
Upper management.<eos> This, Templeton, is where all the action is.<eos> Nap time in Sector G.<eos> So this whole place is run by babies?<eos> Yep.<eos> My Dad says, "Those who can, do."<eos> "And those who can't, supervise."<eos> Your father is a hippy.<eos> What happens when you grow up?<eos> We don't.
We got a code red.<eos> Repeat...<eos> We got a code red!<eos> What are you doing, Templeton?<eos> Go, go!<eos> But that's jaywalking!<eos> Here, I'll pay your ticket.<eos> Go!<eos> I think we lost him!<eos> Oh, no, we didn't!
Rocket grabbed the pieces, and reassembled them. I think Yondu would want you to have it.<eos> Thanks...<eos> Captain.<eos> They came.<eos> What is it?<eos> I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies, and told them what he did.<eos> It's a Ravager funeral.<eos> Yeah!<eos> He didn't let us down after all, Captain.<eos> No, he did not, son.
We could go and find him.<eos> We don't have to tell him who I am.<eos> I could just see him, you know?<eos> Maybe I could ask for the time.<eos> No one has to know.<eos> Do you know where he lives?<eos> No.<eos> His name?<eos> Gardner, I promise, I don't know anything about him.<eos> Nobody does.
This is my life!<eos> Gardner.<eos> Gardner, please.<eos> Come on, just come with us...<eos> I'm going to find my father.<eos> He's all I have.<eos> Is there another way around?<eos> That's not true.<eos> You have me.<eos> No, I don't.
There's a difference.<eos> Secondly, people don't go around saying what they feel whenever they feel it.<eos> They have guards and shields and other metaphors.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we're all messed up and scared and trying to be something that we're not.<eos> And if we all went around just declaring our innermost desires to the exact people we felt them for, well, then we'd all end up happy, or something.<eos> Look, Gardner...<eos> I'm happy that you think I'm beautiful and I've kind of had an amazing time with you.<eos> But the last thing I'm gonna do is actually tell you that.<eos> You just did.
The police.<eos> You'll understand that I will be instructing our corporate attorneys not to assist you in any way.<eos> Frank.<eos> - Zero delay on the distribution plan.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Scrap Lucy's precious promotional marketing crap.<eos> - Tell everyone ASAP.<eos> - Definitely.<eos> We already have FDA approval, correct?<eos> Yes, we do.
Okay, let's do this thing.<eos> Come on.<eos> Now, I have no ego about it, but...<eos> I do know this stuff.<eos> Okay, cool.<eos> Well, what do you know?<eos> Okay.<eos> I know your parents died in a crash.<eos> -Dude. -He didn't tell me.<eos> They did.
Elliot?<eos> Go away!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We're not going anywhere, Elliot.<eos> Uncle, open up!<eos> Get her out of here.<eos> Both of you!<eos> You need to go!<eos> Open the goddamn door, or I'm callin' the police.<eos> Good, do it!
Are they?<eos> They're bound to be looking for us soon.<eos> You have something I want, Ray.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I got it memorized.<eos> All the numbers, memorized perfectly.<eos> But honestly, Mr. Cooper, I think it might be worth some money.<eos> Maybe... quite a lot of money.<eos> You think so, do you?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
Have you been drinking, sir?<eos> Any drugs or medications?<eos> Have you taken anything?<eos> Case file.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Just a second.<eos> Dougie?<eos> Ma'am, do you know this man?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
After what happened in Arizona? You are lucky I let you carry a flashlight.<eos> Yes, I know. I got the memo.<eos> Goldie...<eos> You look ten years younger and 20 years finer.<eos> If the table wasn't here, I'd put another baby in you.<eos> What are you doing living with my kids?<eos> Our kids.<eos> 'Cause I'm the best dad in the world.<eos> I'm there when you need me, I'm gone when you don't.<eos> - We don't.
Yes, I know. I got the memo.<eos> Goldie...<eos> You look ten years younger and 20 years finer.<eos> If the table wasn't here, I'd put another baby in you.<eos> What are you doing living with my kids?<eos> Our kids.<eos> 'Cause I'm the best dad in the world.<eos> I'm there when you need me, I'm gone when you don't.<eos> - We don't.<eos> They don't.
You left your brother with an unfit guardian.<eos> He's not...<eos> A man has a right to protect his family regardless of the law.<eos> - What is he talking about?<eos> - Oh, that's, uh, Manifest Destiny.<eos> Well, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to take the kids.<eos> - Sorry. It's my job.<eos> - No.<eos> You don't...
So we're saints.<eos> if that's what you think.<eos> Oh! - We're gonna be okay!<eos> - Dad!<eos> Did I wake you?<eos> I was meditating.<eos> Is that something you do?<eos> Hmm? I was trying to focus my chi so I could get myself out of here.<eos> How'd it work?<eos> It didn't.
But Harold, now, is a different story.<eos> He was more than willing to partner up.<eos> What?<eos> And when your father found out...<eos> Well...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Hey!<eos> - That's it.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> Maybe it did.
I didn't do anything.<eos> I know this has been hard on you.<eos> We can tell him now though, right?<eos> Soon.<eos> I still need to test a couple of things.<eos> But we need to be honest.<eos> I need to be.<eos> I don't like keeping things from him.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> What if he doesn't?
I accepted that.<eos> You were still my brother.<eos> like a thief in the night.<eos> - That's not what happened.<eos> - Then explain it to me.<eos> I want to know why you abandoned us.<eos> Why you abandoned me.<eos> Ever since I got to K'un-Lun... I... I've always felt empty.<eos> I thought maybe the... the Iron Fist would fix me.<eos> But it didn't.
Good.<eos> "Hit the throat above and the groin below."<eos> You did that in opposite order!<eos> Sorry, I got them mixed up.<eos> "Ten feet ahead is not too far to strike."<eos> "A close hit..." Loosen up.<eos> "...is within an inch."<eos> You say one thing and do another.<eos> I'd rather you just fight and say nothing.<eos> Hey, kid, you did okay.
To have unlimited wishes for all time in perpetuity."<eos> -That's p-e-r-p--<eos> -I got it.<eos> -Satisfied?<eos> -Yes, very.<eos> All right, come on. Let's get on with this shindig.<eos> Give me the keys to the cuffs first.<eos> No, make the wish first.<eos> You think I'm stupid?<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah.<eos> Misty says you'll be arraigned within 24 hours... but we can figure this out.<eos> Has anyone approached you about making a deal?<eos> I know a lawyer.<eos> There ain't no deal.<eos> There were dead bodies in there.<eos> Looks like you were doing grunt work.<eos> Like you were helping to clean up.<eos> - Look, it doesn't matter.<eos> - Of course it does.
You wanna help me?<eos> My mom, she lives at 555 Edgecombe.<eos> Take her some lotto tickets.<eos> Tell her they're from me.<eos> Cole, just tell me what you know.<eos> Scratch-off. Those are her favorite, all right?<eos> Just do it.<eos> Tell her that they're from me. Tell her that I'm thinking about her.<eos> - You can trust me.<eos> - I do.
- Does it look like we're hiding?<eos> - Behind Midland Circle Financial.<eos> Behind corporate shells, or street-level criminals who don't know who they're working for.<eos> But I'm here to expose you.<eos> I am the Immortal Iron Fist, weapon of K'un-Lun.<eos> - And I'm fulfilling my destiny.<eos> - K'un-Lun.<eos> How is it these days?<eos> You're gonna lose everything.<eos> Just like I did.
- And, uh... you are?<eos> - No, I can't. I'm not doing this.<eos> - Doing what?<eos> - Whatever happened back there, we did what we had to.<eos> We got out alive.<eos> The less we know about each other, the better.<eos> - This is...<eos> It's too much already.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Don't... - Jesus.
I know what I said.<eos> We don't have to have this conversation. Just talk to me.<eos> Just... just tell me.<eos> I'm doing it again.<eos> Because if I don't, people will die.<eos> Whatever the Hand is up to...<eos> New York is in its crosshairs.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> I know.<eos> But I don't.
You are afraid of dying.<eos> We want to live long enough to go home.<eos> Perhaps... it's time to make a plan without the Black Sky.<eos> Or our fearless leader.<eos> I was willing to work with you.<eos> But how can I trust you?<eos> Her name is Elektra.<eos> She was raised by him.<eos> Trained to fight the Hand.<eos> Which she did, with me.
Plus, I occasionally help the landlord out.<eos> Not proud of it, but I put on the suit and rough up people late on rent.<eos> I hope that's a joke.<eos> Sorry about the mess.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You should see my place.<eos> What, do you work from home?<eos> I used to have a partner. We had an office.<eos> And?<eos> Now we don't.
But you don't break this case, they'll remember that, too.<eos> Shit!<eos> Do you recognize that language?<eos> That's why you dragged me down here?<eos> To be a translator?<eos> What does it say?<eos> I've seen this language before, but there's a lot I didn't learn.<eos> A lot they didn't tell me.<eos> Besides, even if I could read it... I have no idea what this is.<eos> Well, lucky for us, I do.
I'm sorry.<eos> You know, if you don't like this house just tell me.<eos> I'll understand.<eos> What I'm not gonna understand is this: You playing games.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm not sorry.<eos> You never believe me so why should I expect you to change?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I believed you when you told me that someone stole your lenses.<eos> They did.
Fuck.<eos> Oh, God damn.<eos> Here's your ice.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't get to the cops faster.<eos> Oh, it's totally cool.<eos> - Sorry we didn't get you out of here.<eos> - Well, sure tried.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we did.
You leaving?<eos> Um, I was actually just about to come talk to you.<eos> Uh, about New York.<eos> There a problem?<eos> Um... I'm so grateful for the opportunity, Jack, but with such short notice, i made plans that I can't change.<eos> But I will have my phone on me all weekend. So if you need anything, I'm available.<eos> Ana, have a seat.<eos> I'm really... I'm sorry.<eos> I think you have tremendous potential here. But I don't wanna waste my time training someone who doesn't take this position seriously.<eos> I do.
Come on.<eos> It's nice out.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Hey, no more math today.<eos> Is there a God?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I would if I could.<eos> But I don't know.<eos> And neither does anybody else.
Why are you bringing me this deal?<eos> Other than I'm required to by law?<eos> You like this deal?<eos> I love this deal.<eos> They think they're gonna lose.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They do.<eos> You think we're gonna lose.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do, Frank.
What are you doing?<eos> Oh, I thought maybe you wanna... get some sleep.<eos> What about you?<eos> Are you not sleeping?<eos> Does the average men not sleep?<eos> Yes, we sleep.<eos> We just don't sleep with a...<eos> You don't sleep with women?<eos> No, I mean, I do, I sleep with... I sleep with...<eos> Yes, I do..
That's why we're here.<eos> The gas will kill everything.<eos> What kind weapons kills innocents?<eos> In this war... Every kind.<eos> You were absent at the counsel meeting, General.<eos> I see you are negotiating the terms of the armistice without me.<eos> - On the Kaiser's behalf.<eos> - I'm on your insistence.<eos> We could easily win this war if only you had a little faith.<eos> We don't.
- It can not be them!<eos> - Diana, people...<eos> I...<eos> She was right.<eos> My mother was right.<eos> She said the world of men do not deserve you.<eos> They don't deserve our help, Steve.<eos> - It's not about deserve!<eos> - They do not deserve our help.<eos> Maybe, Maybe we don't!
They are ugly... filled with hatred... weak... Just like your captain Trevor.<eos> Gone and left you nothing.<eos> And for what?<eos> Pathetic!<eos> They deserved to burn!<eos> Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.<eos> She is the perfect example of these humans... and unworthy of your sympathy in every way.<eos> Destroy her, Diana.<eos> You know that she deserves.<eos> That they all do.
That's the discipline.<eos> I'm sorry, sorry, it's part of being a detective to wear multiple pairs of underwear?<eos> Do you have multiple pairs of underwear on right now?<eos> That's my secret.<eos> Cool.<eos> - Get yourself ready.<eos> - Classic father figure.<eos> Jesus Christ, Nola.<eos> No, this has gotta stop, okay?<eos> It really does.
I got it, I got it.<eos> Dude... okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hang on to that.<eos> There he is, come here.<eos> Buddy!<eos> I missed you so much!<eos> You been feeding my dog?<eos> Pedigree, lamb and rice blend, he loves that shit.<eos> Yeah, he does.
You present yourself as an agent of the free states of America, like a good little sheep.<eos> But long since you've been dangled in front of the king of england by the east India company.<eos> Now you're scrabbling, desperate...<eos> Pulling your wool... Over everybody's eyes.<eos> Possibly even your own.<eos> Does it even matter?<eos> No.<eos> No one in this city has only one master.<eos> Pen.<eos> I do.
I would kill for a mulatto - the Danish pay double.<eos> Hmm...<eos> I met her.<eos> People are saying you're mad.<eos> I am.<eos> I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> Hmm?<eos> You have goodness in you.<eos> What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.
For the safe.<eos> Go.<eos> Murderer!<eos> Murderer!<eos> Do you know who blew up your ship?<eos> I've been thinking a lot about what happened, and... and I think we were right.<eos> There wasn't the time for such...<eos> And we have plenty of time.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
I will, Dougie.<eos> I will.<eos> Bushnell...<eos> I've been selling you down the river for months and months for Duncan Todd.<eos> I've been working for Todd.<eos> I...<eos> I've lied and cheated for money.<eos> Anthony... Dougie already showed me.<eos> He explained all this already.<eos> He did?
How are you?<eos> Hanging in.<eos> I will have the usual.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Get that right up for you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Yeah, no problem.<eos> Hey, Norma.<eos> Shelly go home already?<eos> Yeah, she did.
I know it is but as I'm sure you know, an election here is a fragile thing.<eos> It's a very delicate thing, and nobody wants its smooth running to be muddied by a big new American offensive.<eos> No, I told you no more troops, Glen.<eos> Now we're gonna have to rethink the game plan.<eos> Well, Dick, with all due respect, you told me you didn't care if I got more troops or I didn't, so I'm trying to work out how to get the job done.<eos> No, I did not say I didn't care.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - I did not say that.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - No. No, I didn't. I...
I sort of made a move.<eos> Can you talk?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Millicent's just taking a post coital cool off.<eos> Tell me you closed her.<eos> Tell me you closed her during silent auction.<eos> She didn't even see me.<eos> I'm not sure about this one.<eos> She's impossible to get to.<eos> I have no in.<eos> Or maybe I do.
I'm gonna pay you, I promise.<eos> Hey, you got a real nice place here.<eos> By nice place, I mean a total dump.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> People just say what they mean, it's confusing.<eos> Guys, this is my sister's place, please.<eos> You know what your problem is?<eos> You don't have any respect for money man!<eos> - Money doesn't grow on trees.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Isn't that right, David?<eos> Isn't that right? You sucked cock...<eos> Don't fuck with me, Madalyn. Don't fuck with me.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Hello, football fans...<eos> We got beer, vodka, cigs.<eos> Finally.<eos> Hope you didn't forget about me, Danny.<eos> No, I did not.
Stiles.<eos> Your son.<eos> Uh-huh. And maybe it's just a random signal cross?<eos> Peter gave us the keys to the Jeep and it started right up.<eos> Claudia's Jeep.<eos> Oh, wait, wait, so, now I'm supposed to trust Peter Hale?<eos> I want you to trust me.<eos> I heard Stiles on that radio, I'm sure of it.<eos> - If you had heard it too...<eos> - Well, I didn't.
Or what we did for our anniversary or Christmas for...<eos> I don't know how many years.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> We went to Big Sur.<eos> No.<eos> We always wanted to go to Big Sur.<eos> We did.<eos> I remember.<eos> No, baby.<eos> We didn't.
Do you copy?<eos> I repeat, any and all units, this is Sheriff Stilinski.<eos> Respond immediately with your 20.<eos> - All units...<eos> - They're gone.<eos> That, that...<eos> That's not possible.<eos> That's...<eos> They couldn't have taken everyone.<eos> They didn't.
I don't know.<eos> She never told me anything.<eos> But if I took it, it would have been a part of her that followed me around.<eos> You all right?<eos> I need that medicine.<eos> What if it's the only thing keeping me alive?<eos> - She ever tell you about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I got "bad blood."<eos> Heck, who doesn't?
Why'd she have it?<eos> I don't know. She never told me anything.<eos> But if I took it, it would have been a part of her that followed me around.<eos> You all right?<eos> I need that medicine.<eos> What if it's the only thing keeping me alive?<eos> - She ever tell you about that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I got "bad blood."<eos> Oh, heck, who doesn't?
What am I even doing here?<eos> You obviously hate me and now you want me to, what?<eos> Eat candy apples with you?<eos> Or am I supposed to trail behind you like some kind of pet?<eos> Or maybe I'm here to entertain you, so you can laugh at my clumsiness, my freakishness, is that it?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> You're my friend.<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> Do you even know what a friend is?<eos> Of course I do.
Witches!<eos> Still here, are you?<eos> There doesn't have to be a war.<eos> Is that why The Wizard animated the Stone Giant?<eos> Because he wants peace?<eos> He didn't.<eos> I did.<eos> How wrong Roan was about you.<eos> He didn't know me.<eos> Now he does.
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> You are not a compromise to me.<eos> I do not regret what I did, no matter the consequences.<eos> And I didn't want you to have any reason to think that I did.<eos> Her family has the ability to do that, to manipulate your creditors so easily?<eos> Creditors respond to money.<eos> And they respond to influence.<eos> Her family has both.<eos> I understand.<eos> But... so does mine.
I wanna...<eos> Good job.<eos> You stayin' out here, bro?<eos> Yeah, for sure.<eos> - That's gotta be them.<eos> - What? That's gotta be them right there.<eos> What is that, some kind of special FBI app?<eos> It's "Find My iPhone." I have Clay's password.<eos> You don't have my password, do you?<eos> Yeah, I do. "The Baker, 1980."
Did you think of leaving him then?<eos> I've thought of leaving him many times.<eos> But then I think about what we have, and we have a lot.<eos> Are there any weapons in your house? No.<eos> No, it's not like that.<eos> I mean, the boys have some lightsabers.<eos> Listen, you see a lot of couples - that have bad problems.<eos> - Mm-hmm. And after a while, maybe that's all you can see.<eos> Do you ever pause to consider what is great in a marriage, what is profoundly right?<eos> I do.
That's where they buried her.<eos> I traced it to a town called Sacrament Valley, about four hours from here.<eos> That's where we need to go.<eos> Hello?<eos> Thank you, Jamal.<eos> The police are on their way here.<eos> And you're not even coming with us!<eos> The police want to ask me questions, Holt.<eos> - They think you killed Skye.<eos> - But you didn't.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> I'm arresting you under suspicion for disturbing the peace.<eos> Please lie face down on the ground.<eos> Why?<eos> I didn't do anything. Eh?<eos> I mean, what did I do?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Lie face down on the ground, arms stretched out, please.<eos> Hey, leave me alone, OK?<eos> I didn't do anything.
Well, when I got there, Germaine had already left.<eos> She was, um... She was writing, but her influence was definitely there.<eos> I was very, very lucky.<eos> I'd love it if you wanted to see some of it, Mary.<eos> - I mean, I'd be wi...<eos> - No. I hate feminism, Mum.<eos> It's boring.<eos> - See what we've raised?<eos> - I like wearing make-up.<eos> - Everyone at school does.
How long have you known that guy?<eos> I met him today.<eos> Why?<eos> Man, this is gonna sound weird, but when he came at me, it felt like I knew him.<eos> Like you've met Logan before?<eos> No, I don't know Logan.<eos> I knew the guy that come at me.<eos> I think your mom got in my head, all right? I think she got in my head.<eos> Yeah, and it worked, I thought...<eos> No, it did not.
Always better dead than forgotten.<eos> And no one is ever gonna forget you.<eos> Now, flattering as that may be, this, on top of your other adventures...<eos> Sudden onset of strange.<eos> Fair cause for consternation, unless strange is a new language and what we're doing here is vocabulary building.<eos> Fuck your vocabulary.<eos> Okay? This is gibberish.<eos> You may have to consider that you didn't see what you saw.<eos> - Or...<eos> - Or you did.
Oh, and the box of tapes should have included a map.<eos> I'll be mentioning several spots around our beloved city.<eos> I can't force you to visit them, but if you'd like a little more insight, head for the stars.<eos> Or, you know, just throw the map away and I'll never know... or will I?<eos> You see, in case you're tempted to break the rules, understand I did make a copy of these tapes, and I left them with a trusted individual who, if this package doesn't make it through all of you,<eos> will release those copies in a very public manner.<eos> This was not a spur of the moment decision.<eos> Do not take me for granted.<eos> Not again.<eos> I never did!
My hair does the same thing no matter what, just sits there.<eos> You just need some product.<eos> A little effort to style it, blow-dry it in the morning.<eos> And sacrifice my masculinity?<eos> That ship has sailed, don't you think?<eos> Forgive me for wanting to keep my brains in my head.<eos> Instead of, say, some other regions, like most boys?<eos> Come on, Helmet, you've got bathrooms to clean.<eos> - You mean "we've got."<eos> - Mm. I don't, actually.
No, I did not.<eos> - Did you know she was going to? - No.<eos> - Then how the hell...<eos> - Listen to the tapes, Clay.<eos> Is that all I'm gonna get?<eos> Hannah wanted it done like this.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> You have to listen.<eos> What if I don't?
We're only here for four years.<eos> If you live that long.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Zach and Marcus really wanted to give me a ride just now at school.<eos> So?<eos> So... that's never happened before.<eos> They even invited me to hang at Bryce's.<eos> At Bryce's?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Of course they did.
We've got a project.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> The old project trope.<eos> The only class you two have together is gym.<eos> It's creepy that you even know that.<eos> Just go away.<eos> What I think... is that you wouldn't do something like that.<eos> I thought you loved Jessica.<eos> I did. I mean...<eos> Maybe I even still do, but...
It's kind of soul-crushing, you know?<eos> Seriously?<eos> He's Zach Dempsey.<eos> Does he really need compliments?<eos> We all need it.<eos> Human contact.<eos> And communications class, crazy as it was, was human contact for me.<eos> Until someone in that class cut my lifeline... someone who is known for being sweet.<eos> I'll tell you who it is... but you're going to have to wait.<eos> Just like I did.
Do you want to talk in there?<eos> Stop.<eos> - I've got to stop.<eos> - You want me to stop the car? No.<eos> Yes!<eos> No, no.<eos> What does she say next?<eos> I mean, does she say what she did?<eos> Does she say why?<eos> She does.
- I'll rephrase.<eos> Um, did Hannah ever say anything to you that might lead you to believe that she did take it seriously?<eos> Not really.<eos> I-I think...<eos> I think...<eos> I might have been... I might have hurt Hannah's feelings... a little bit.<eos> But I didn't mean to.<eos> Hurt her feelings how?<eos> I thought she wanted to date me.<eos> She didn't.
And who has them now?<eos> At this point, I don't know.<eos> Jesus.<eos> But who's gonna believe a dead girl, right?<eos> I guess we'll find out.<eos> Justin.<eos> Justin.<eos> You know the real story, right?<eos> You know what's true.<eos> I do now.
I want to believe he held on to it.<eos> Why wouldn't he have taken this with him?<eos> Why would he leave it on the floor?<eos> There weren't tracks out there before.<eos> We didn't find anything now.<eos> Maybe Daryl could've picked something up.<eos> He left.<eos> He didn't leave a note.<eos> He obviously doesn't want to be found.<eos> Yes, he does.
As a token of my gratitude, I'm gonna send you over a few of my wives to your apartment tonight, show you a good time.<eos> Now, I don't think I have to worry about this.<eos> But who knows how truly smart you are?<eos> No sex.<eos> That is a grave no-no.<eos> However, you can have a little dinner, some drinks, share a few laughs.<eos> There is nothing like beautiful women that smell good to make you feel human again.<eos> I wouldn't know anything about that.<eos> D-D-Did you say "wives," meaning plural?<eos> Hell yes, I did.
It's not gonna hold.<eos> There it goes!<eos> Split them off into smaller groups.<eos> The barriers might hold.<eos> You take slide, I take Ferris wheel?<eos> Or we could just go.<eos> - You want to go? - Nah.<eos> We can do this.<eos> Yeah, I know we can.<eos> How you doing? !
And something else happened because we have done nothing to stop them.<eos> We've done nothing!<eos> Nothing.<eos> I was in a camp when it started.<eos> It was huge...endless... a city of -- of tarps and latrines and wood smoke and babies crying.<eos> There were always babies crying.<eos> I knew they had problems, but I didn't think they were mine to solve.<eos> I thought there were stronger or smarter people there than me.<eos> W-Who the hell am I, right?<eos> So I did nothing.
But I know now that I was full-tilt delusional.<eos> I have never in my life been as scared as I was that night in the woods, kit to the grit, fully believing my number's about to be called, then seeing it happen to someone brave to a survivor.<eos> And then the pants-pissing terror of the rinse and repeat of that very same event ... I just...<eos> I couldn't.<eos> Being here means I'll never have to again.<eos> And neither will you if you just say "yes."<eos> Please say "yes."<eos> He would want you to.<eos> He wouldn't.<eos> I do.
I want you to sit.<eos> Hey, Cyndie.<eos> You promised.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.<eos> Put your hands on your head.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I said I didn't have a choice.<eos> But you do, both of you do.
But it sounds to me like you happen to be already gone.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> Where's Sasha?<eos> There's someone here.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down.<eos> Come on. Whoa!<eos> He says he wants to help us.<eos> That true?<eos> You want to help?<eos> I do.
I love you, buckaroo. I'll always love you.<eos> And I will see you on the other side.<eos> I don't want my mom or anybody to see this.<eos> I gave my word to Markus that I would show you... And only you, one day.<eos> I had to trust you first.<eos> Does that make us square?<eos> Hello, neighbor.<eos> Hello.<eos> You know, if I cooked, I would have brought you a casserole...<eos> But I don't, so I didn't.
But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it.<eos> All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl. - I hate you!<eos> - Not an issue, sweetie.<eos> That's enough!<eos> Drop the gun, Rick!<eos> Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fucking this up right now.<eos> I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!<eos> I wasn't gonna let her die, you fucking moron!<eos> The point is he thought I was going to.<eos> I totally did, by the way.
It's an old grave of a child.<eos> I totally know what all this is.<eos> You shouldn't call me here.<eos> It's still early, but the results of last night's hepatectomy are incredibly encouraging. There's clear evidence of complex tissue regeneration.<eos> Maybe what doesn't kill you really can make you stronger.<eos> I strongly recommend a contingency plan to be put in place.<eos> A little girls remains have been stolen.<eos> Her name is Suluk Tavra.<eos> And I know what he is going to do to her soul.<eos> So do you...
Did you know that Matt won't let me cross the city limits?<eos> He thinks if I go over that bridge, the magical spell that woke me from my slumber will break and I'll go back into a coma.<eos> Listen, I know Matt can get carried away, but his heart's in the right place.<eos> He's writing a book about you.<eos> He what?<eos> A book.<eos> He thinks the New Testament's getting old.<eos> I've only read some of it, but you figure fairly prominently, Kevin.<eos> - Did you know about this?<eos> - No, I did not.
A way to send the protomolecule. To our solar system?<eos> It begs the question, sent by whom?<eos> And why?<eos> Did he just say what I think he said?<eos> He said, "extra-solar object".<eos> First proof of extraterrestrial life.<eos> And it's just more death.<eos> You still got a beat on that signal. That you guys intercepted leaving eros?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course we do.
If we want answers, we have to take that station.<eos> It's floating dark, barely registers on radar. But it's got a habitat ring, which means someone's home.<eos> The first thing we have to get past is this.<eos> That's a stealth ship.<eos> Like the ones they used to kill the donnager.<eos> We have a gunship of our own.<eos> Slugging it out with a stealth is not gonna get it done.<eos> If you want to take that station, You need to land an assault team.<eos> Do you have any idea of the resistance inside?<eos> No, we don't.
How many targets can it track simultaneously?<eos> 300, with the ability to engage 36 of them at any one time.<eos> I'm... I'm free to go?<eos> You can go, but you're not free.<eos> Copies of these photographs can be e-mailed to everyone on your contact list at any time.<eos> Understood?<eos> Something you should know.<eos> What?<eos> Iran doesn't want a nuclear weapon.<eos> It never did.
The guy that I made the videos with.<eos> And he'll confirm what you're saying?<eos> That it was just a loan for travel.<eos> Sekou?<eos> Is what I say here really privileged?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> One-hundred percent?<eos> Because I don't want to mess him up.<eos> He wanted me to meet some guy before I went to Africa...<eos> Saad did.
The number that Sekou gave us has been disconnected, but we have to find him, because the money he gave your son looks very bad.<eos> I don't know him.<eos> Simone?<eos> Uh, no, Mum.<eos> I never even heard of him.<eos> You sure he exists?<eos> He exists.<eos> He gave your son $5,000.<eos> Sekou don't have $5,000.<eos> He does, ma'am.
Let a jury decide how certain they are he's not gonna pick up an AR-15 and shoot them all in their sleep?<eos> Look, if you want to believe the kid's a saint, go ahead.<eos> You go anywhere near Saad Mahsud,<eos> I will have you arrested.<eos> It was nice talking to you.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> Yep. National security right down the line.<eos> The informant is off-limits.<eos> So how do we talk to him?<eos> We don't.
You came... very close to dying.<eos> Very... close.<eos> You must know that.<eos> There's a video of it.<eos> It was...<eos> It was all over the Internet.<eos> You've never seen it?<eos> No, I-I didn't want to.<eos> Of course.<eos> But I do now.
I'm just wondering how the hell you pulled it off.<eos> It's better you don't know.<eos> Trust me.<eos> As long as this doesn't come back and bite us in the ass.<eos> - It won't.<eos> - Well, we're gonna be asked why we're not bringing a civil suit, that's for sure, why we're not sending a clear message to law enforcement. I...<eos> I think they got the message.<eos> What about Sekou?<eos> Doesn't he deserve to be compensated?<eos> Of course he does.
- Whoa. - Sheesh!<eos> - Boy's got his own lawyer now. - Hey, hey, hey. Nah, nah, nah.<eos> - Damn!<eos> - Nah, nah, nah. - He's cool.<eos> He's cool.<eos> - How'd he get you out, anyways?<eos> It was bullshit.<eos> They didn't have a case.<eos> You got lucky then.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Y-you... you...<eos> You're 14 minutes late.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - But I was worried.<eos> - You should call.<eos> - Well, don't worry.<eos> I was with Franny.<eos> We were fine.<eos> A man came to school, and he had painted hair, and he scared Mommy.<eos> No, he didn't, sweetheart.
- Oh, Jesus--<eos> - How did you find this place?<eos> Carrie Mathison defended Sekou Bah.<eos> It's public record.<eos> Someone called the station, said there was gonna be a demonstration here.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Someone, I don't know.<eos> Does he live across the--<eos> Does-<eos> - Does he?
Let me go in and talk to him.<eos> He's already got two hostages.<eos> - I'm not gonna give him a third.<eos> - I'm telling you--<eos> They're not hostages and he's not a shooter!<eos> When I left this morning, I asked him to protect my daughter.<eos> And he is!<eos> From people throwing rocks, from this army you've got out here.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do!
I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> I know.<eos> It's, uh...<eos> It's urgent.<eos> Carrie?<eos> Madame President-elect.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> Children's Services has put Franny into foster care.<eos> I don't...
Well, coming from someone who fucked a guy in a suicide vest, that means a lot.<eos> Just answer the damn thing.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Carrie Mathison?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Hi.<eos> This is Maria at Child Services.<eos> You've been approved for a visit with your daughter tomorrow at our offices.<eos> Do you know where that is?<eos> I do.
Gold Star mom?<eos> You are.<eos> You're a bad dream.<eos> A President of the United States who can't be controlled from within.<eos> What if I told you...<eos> I'm not ready for this, any of it?<eos> I'd say, "Good."<eos> You'd be crazy to feel ready.<eos> What if the American people made a mistake?<eos> They didn't.
I'm here as a liaison to the intelligence community in this very difficult period.<eos> But they've subpoenaed the personnel files<eos> - of everybody in my department.<eos> - Yes.<eos> The investigation has broad powers under the amended provisions of the PATRIOT Act.<eos> That's a far cry from compiling an enemies list, Rachel.<eos> Is it?<eos> Step into the President's shoes for a minute.<eos> Doesn't she have a right to know how deep and wide this conspiracy went?<eos> Don't the American people?
And how was Saul Berenson connected?<eos> He almost died in the bombing.<eos> There's evidence of his complicity.<eos> - Where?<eos> What evidence?<eos> - The NSA's made its meta-databases available to us.<eos> The NSA?<eos> He had multiple contacts with each of the core conspirators<eos> - in the weeks leading...<eos> - Yeah. Of course he did... In the context of his job.
Well, Mossad wasn't acting alone.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> They had support from inside our own intelligence community.<eos> The deal with Iran has been formally adopted.<eos> It's settled policy.<eos> Any attempt to undermine it's--<eos> Treason.<eos> You have proof of all this, I'm assuming.<eos> I do.
"I don't know. I don't know."<eos> - What do you know?<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> I didn't come all this way to get yelled at.<eos> - Tell me, then.<eos> - What?<eos> What did you come here for?<eos> Sorry?<eos> Dar Adal called you.<eos> - Yeah, he did.
You'll want to hear this.<eos> That was Brett O'Keefe on the phone.<eos> He says he made the video.<eos> He admits it now when we already know?<eos> He says he's responding to your call to come out of hiding.<eos> He wants to discuss it with you on his show this afternoon.<eos> No debate, no prep, just two people talking.<eos> His words.<eos> Which, obviously, you don't want to do.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
That seem familiar to any of you?<eos> Because it does to me.<eos> It's what we did in Nicaragua, Chile, Congo, a dozen other places, all the way back to Iran in the '50s.<eos> And it does not end well for the elected regime.<eos> You're fighting for your lives here.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> You can't afford to stay silent-- and I don't mean press conferences.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You said, "Show your face."<eos> He did.
I met power today.<eos> Power came to my place of work, surrounded by goose-stepping men in long coats.<eos> And I'll be honest--<eos> I was afraid.<eos> Afraid.<eos> I felt the weight of the state, that jackboot on my neck when I heard these words from the president-elect--<eos> "You will be prosecuted.<eos> You will be shut down. Because in my government, you will have no place."<eos> For a moment there, I thought I might have changed some minds.<eos> You did.
I don't have to tell you every community has a different part, so I've had to learn it piece by piece...<eos> Every sacred site, every ceremony, every word.<eos> You want my song?<eos> It's the last one.<eos> The last one.<eos> And it is my understanding that you are the only man alive who knows it.<eos> My song is bring the rain, not stopping.<eos> Well, that's all subject to interpretation.<eos> You want to stop the flood?<eos> I do.
Please dispose all rubbish and collect your personal belongings before you disembark.<eos> Thank you for sailing with us.<eos> We do hope you enjoyed the voyage.<eos> There you are.<eos> Fishing boat found a body.<eos> Matches your description.<eos> I've notified the police.<eos> They'll be taking Burton into custody when we dock.<eos> They'd like you to go down to the station and make a statement, assuming you don't have any pressing business in Melbourne.<eos> No, I don't.
Hey, are you...?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Wh... Michael?<eos> He's fine.<eos> He's just sleeping.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's true...<eos> I borrowed your pills.<eos> Looks real.<eos> Indeed, it does.
- No, she'll settle.<eos> Okay, I'll stuff you.<eos> On one condition.<eos> Shoot.<eos> I get to put a beard on you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm the one that has to have sex with that abomination.<eos> I'm gonna dress it up how I want.<eos> You want me to grow a beard.<eos> Do I?
That's him.<eos> - What?<eos> No. N-no, I didn't.<eos> - Yeah, you did.<eos> It's the one that was in the typewriter - in the fucking beach house.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I was there, but it's not fucking mine.<eos> - Boys, boys.<eos> I think we can all agree you both wrote the same book.<eos> No, we didn't!
Over here, we lost some of them.<eos> But over there, they lost all of us.<eos> So, I went and did what I came there to do.<eos> I went to find my kids.<eos> Planes don't really fly over there.<eos> They have enough resources, just not enough pilots.<eos> So, I found a boat that would take me.<eos> No boats go directly from Australia to New York, so it took me a long time to get there.<eos> A long time.<eos> But I finally did.
But I found him and I asked him to make another machine because he already knew how.<eos> And he asked me if I had come all that way, why in God's name did I wanna go back?<eos> And I told him it's because I didn't belong there.<eos> So, he built it.<eos> And I came back through.<eos> I came back here.<eos> Did I... think about you?<eos> Did I wanna call you?<eos> Did I wanna be with you, Kevin?<eos> Of course I did.
But they won't make any moves until they confirm Grimes has the list of sleepers. No.<eos> Ben told me to come alone.<eos> He spots anyone he even thinks might be with the government, he will bolt.<eos> I'll make sure the tac team stays hidden.<eos> You're not hearing me.<eos> Ben is counter-surveillance trained, okay? He's also very paranoid.<eos> Carter, Grimes has already gotten away from you once.<eos> We can't let that happen again.<eos> Eric, you and I were operating alone because we didn't know who we could trust.<eos> Now we do.
For me? You did it for me?<eos> It was the only way I could save your campaign.<eos> Six weeks ago, I was contacted by someone claiming to be Jadalla Bin-Khalid.<eos> He said he had evidence that my company had bought off-market oil from ISIL.<eos> Threatened to go public with it.<eos> Is it true?<eos> One of our major pipelines had been blown up a year before.<eos> We were facing a catastrophic production shortfall, and my regional director cut a deal.<eos> So you bought oil from terrorists, then.<eos> No, I didn't.
We're done working up your credentials.<eos> Well, mostly.<eos> Andy, what the hell does that mean?<eos> Mariana's on it.<eos> She's been looped in.<eos> Uh, Mariana?<eos> Yeah, we based your credentials around an agent who's on leave, but we haven't had time to backstop everything.<eos> Will it get me through security or not?<eos> We think so, but I'd feel better if we had a little more time.<eos> Yeah, well, we don't. Okay?
What did they say?<eos> "The lamb was too salty."<eos> Rich kids.<eos> I see.<eos> If only Justice Strauss had been able to get past Count Olaf, if only she'd seen the children in their horrible circumstances, if only this world weren't such a wicked and topsy-turvy place... this story might have turned out differently.<eos> I never wanna use a toothbrush again.<eos> Why aren't you cleaning?<eos> My list was very specific.<eos> We finished it.<eos> No, you didn't.
Sunny!<eos> We're leaving for rehearsals.<eos> But the baby said there was chocolate pudding! Shh.<eos> You children are to clean the table, and wash the dishes, and polish the silver, and rinse out all the wine bottles for recycling.<eos> And then you are to go straight to your beds.<eos> You mean our bed?<eos> You've only provided us with one bed.<eos> If you want another bed, tomorrow you may go into town and purchase one.<eos> You know perfectly well we haven't any money.<eos> Of course you do.
And still, you will not say yes.<eos> So I come to you one last time, to ensure you cannot say no.<eos> - Accept the treaty...<eos> - I will consider no treaty of yours.<eos> And John Silver lives.<eos> Refuse... and he dies... along with the rest of the men who followed him here.<eos> And from what I understand, he is the one who matters most to you.<eos> The one with whom you might lead a life if you can set aside your pride in this moment.<eos> Do not make the same mistake I did.<eos> Do the deal.
I am trying to engineer a future with a species that is more violent, intolerant and possessive than any species in the history of this planet.<eos> Sapiens live in a world designed by their worst fears.<eos> And nothing terrifies them like difference.<eos> You save your fucking justifications.<eos> You murdered an innocent girl.<eos> I know you killed Sara Patrell.<eos> Who?<eos> There will always be unfortunate necessities during the construction of a monument such as this.<eos> I thought a cop would understand that.<eos> Angelica did.
I wouldn't.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Two of the goons were rentals.<eos> They'll go in, sweep the room, then head back out here.<eos> Ms. Facchini.<eos> Mr. Bohm.<eos> I was hoping it'd be you.<eos> Why?<eos> Fuchs doesn't see what you are. He doesn't know.<eos> But I do.
So you got these different voices in your head, and one of them is Will?<eos> I know it sounds strange.<eos> If he's in your head listening, does that mean he can hear everything I'm saying?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yes.<eos> So when I say, "Go take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut, Gorski," he can hear that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I deserve it.<eos> He says he deserves it.<eos> Damn right he does.
I know that your life will not be like mine... and that makes me very, very happy.<eos> That was the day you took me to the Spring Festival.<eos> There is much of her in you.<eos> I was nourished by her.<eos> But Joong-Ki was too young.<eos> It was my duty to raise him in her place.<eos> But I failed.<eos> What happened was not your fault.<eos> A lot of people never get the kind of love you got from your mother.<eos> I certainly didn't.
I mean, we just decided to part ways, and, you know, wish each other the best, and, uh, explore other opportunities, et cetera. Blah, blah, blah.<eos> You said I was your guy.<eos> Well, you lied to us, too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can I offer an opinion?<eos> I came alone.<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> That's all.<eos> How did you know I would be here today?<eos> Well, I didn't.
He Bolgered Todd and used him to murder a politician named Mitchell Taylor.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> The church?<eos> Why?<eos> This is where the meeting is supposed to be.<eos> Okay, this is getting weirder and weirder.<eos> Riley?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - He said I had to go down the stairs.<eos> - Who did?
A nice fixer-upper Raj has got himself here.<eos> Um, you really didn't have to do this.<eos> If I can be frank, Mrs. Rasal...<eos> I met Raj quite a bit after your wedding, and it never occurred to me, not once.<eos> But the moment I saw your reaction to the fact that I hadn't been to your wedding, I realized the scale of my mistake.<eos> This is what they mean I think by... the "civilizing nature of women."<eos> - I mean, everyone makes mistakes.<eos> But I think it's important to make amends when appropriate.<eos> As I said, you really didn't have to.<eos> No, but I did.
- He's Pablo? - He's Pablo?<eos> I am.<eos> The deal was inked yesterday.<eos> We're...<eos> That's right, kid.<eos> In your Hollywood debut, you will be falling in love with three-time Academy Award-winning actor<eos> Blake Huntington.<eos> Why do you care so much about those things?<eos> I'm guessing he already told you what he did with his.<eos> Of course I did.
Well, I'm not talking about a rising market.<eos> I mean, we all know how to trade once we get a little mo-mo going.<eos> But when things get a little choppy, does he steer into the skid or does he retreat to look at alternatives?<eos> I thought you'd overpaid me.<eos> But if that's what you're really looking for, you weren't even close to the number.<eos> The number doesn't exist.<eos> I'd never sell him out.<eos> You passed the test.<eos> Do I get the whole chocolate factory now?<eos> Yes, you do.
It'll be tantamount to a class-action suit.<eos> Not so easy to ignore.<eos> Not possible to.<eos> The stories won't be about you anymore. They'll be about him.<eos> And the world of shit that he is in.<eos> You know what you have to do?<eos> I know what I have to do.<eos> This guy doesn't really come out here a few times a week.<eos> No.<eos> He doesn't.
I'm sorry, excuse me.<eos> I don't know what came over... oh!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Excuse me. Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Death by passion is the ultimate rush.<eos> Desert, anyone?<eos> Ah! Wait a second, you didn't tell me Monica told you exactly what happened to Margaret black.<eos> She didn't.
We are very excited to talk to you.<eos> Who isn't excited about textbooks?<eos> We aren't here about textbooks.<eos> We're recruiting officers.<eos> We're with an agency called the Institute for Global Advancement.<eos> You're a man of vastly untapped potential, Alan.<eos> Your current employment in no way suits your talents.<eos> You were selected from a pool of tens of thousands of people.<eos> I don't recall applying for anything.<eos> You didn't.
Dead men can't point fingers.<eos> Good.<eos> This feels good.<eos> Right?<eos> If you kill him, you probably gonna have to kill her, too.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Please, I don't know anything.<eos> I didn't see anything.<eos> They don't seem to care about our lives, so why we gotta give a shit if they live or die?<eos> I do. I do.
Thrilling.<eos> So you need to get near him.<eos> - Tricky.<eos> - Yes, but you can help.<eos> His... name is Reynard the Fox.<eos> A trickster of some sorts, yes?<eos> Oh, that will be a challenge.<eos> Well, you don't really have much choice, do you?<eos> Oh, well aware you have that stylish little blade.<eos> I sure do.
Sir.<eos> Anna, get him.<eos> Anna!<eos> You're next.<eos> - What now?<eos> You've made this move already.<eos> - I have a plan B for you.<eos> Your brother asked me the same that day.<eos> I didn't have any, then.<eos> But I do, today.
Careful.<eos> - This place is beautiful. - Yeah?<eos> - Oh, look! There's a mermaid.<eos> They call this place "Mermaid Cove".<eos> I didn't know that. I can't remember how it goes.<eos> ♪ There once was a mermaid, ♪ ♪ who lived by the pond, ♪<eos> ♪ who was very beautiful, ♪ ♪ and very blond. ♪<eos> Teena McGuire.<eos> Hey, it is Marvin Fick, remember me?<eos> Of course you do.
I had a really good time.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did too. That was so much fun.<eos> - Good.<eos> What are you up to this weekend?<eos> Um... nothing.<eos> Okay. Good.<eos> Well, some friends and I got this Airbnb house in Puglia...<eos> - And you want me to come clean it.<eos> - Yes. Yes, I do.
It was a while ago.<eos> I'm really glad you came out tonight.<eos> Thank you. I'll, uh...<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Business meeting, huh?<eos> For the love of God, Mother, what are you doing here?<eos> I could just as easily ask you that question.<eos> Mother, I am not the one who's supposed to be dead.<eos> I mean, what if someone saw you in here?<eos> No one did.
I don't know.<eos> Even just a bit?<eos> That you're bisexual?<eos> What's this about?<eos> Some very cool people are bisexual, like Lady Gaga or Angelina Jolie.<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> There are people who think that what we did on my birthday...<eos> I don't know.<eos> You should know.<eos> And I do.
Well, maybe not you personally, but the organization you work for.<eos> We're just soldiers.<eos> Soldiers?<eos> Then act like one.<eos> Operation Fortunata.<eos> What about it?<eos> Then you've heard of it?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> He did, didn't he?
- All right...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> No, no. But I am going to show you something... that I think might change your mind.<eos> This could be you.<eos> Mommy, please, put those away.<eos> I hate those pictures.<eos> Oh, hey! The quinceañera.<eos> You're doing it!<eos> Elena, I knew you'd come around.<eos> She didn't!
You might not think that looking at him, because he's a little on the heavy side, but underneath the weight, he's in very good shape.<eos> What are you up to tonight?<eos> Supposed to go to Syd's for this dinner party.<eos> - Fun. - Eh, maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's gonna be me and three couples.<eos> I don't like being the seventh wheel.<eos> - Do you want to come with me?<eos> - Oh, I'd love to, but I'm gonna go see a girl from work's band play.<eos> They do ska.
She's coming! She's coming!<eos> I'm back, I'm back, my darlings, that's right!<eos> Tammy, Tammy, I'm wearing the sacred underwear!<eos> Assalam-Tom-Hanks-um!<eos> But I can't do this without you!<eos> No, I can't.<eos> I need your help, my darlings!<eos> I need to feel your holy, holy love.<eos> Who wants virgins?<eos> I do, I do!
It's not.<eos> All right, Bones, look, you got to give it some time, all right?<eos> I know guys from the service who have lost their memory, okay, and it comes back.<eos> No, this is not just a simple case of amnesia-- it...<eos> my brain, it's... it's different.<eos> I mean, I'm... I'm different.<eos> Look, you know what?<eos> You're healing, all right?<eos> You're gonna get better.<eos> What if I don't?
I know.<eos> It's a special place.<eos> Yeah. It is.<eos> What's all this stuff in the bag here?<eos> Christine?<eos> No.<eos> That's... that's Parker's.<eos> He gave it to me 11 years ago.<eos> He told me he liked me.<eos> Of course he did, huh?
Jasper.<eos> You remember Jasper.<eos> Yeah. - He made it through the explosion.<eos> - Look at that.<eos> Okay. What's with the broken clock?<eos> That stopped when the bombs went off.<eos> When the lab reopens, I'm going to hang it in my new office, to remind me. Always.<eos> Hmm. 4:47.<eos> Why would you want to be reminded of the moment when everything almost ended, Bones?<eos> Because it didn't.
Bathing in her own first bowel movement.<eos> - But will she be all right?<eos> - There's no harm done.<eos> And Mickey is watching television with my own lad.<eos> And wearing a slightly-too-small pair of my daughter's pyjamas.<eos> But a boy can't have everything.<eos> We're going to set up a camp bed for him, so he won't be far away.<eos> We can talk about everything else in the morning.<eos> I used to go down the old rectory gardens when I was a kid.<eos> Do my dreaming.
Gyroscopic forces, acceleration due to gravity, friction.<eos> "Friction"?<eos> Don't you think that it's-it's good to not know how something works?<eos> I mean, come on, science takes the magic out of everything.<eos> There's no magic to begin with.<eos> It's just rules that govern the universe.<eos> Next thing you know you're gonna be telling her that rainbows are...<eos> Light refracted through water?<eos> - She already knows that.<eos> - Of course she does.
Exactly, but the injuries are consistent with this area here that's rockier.<eos> So, how did the victim end up that far out?<eos> She wasn't pushed.<eos> She was held by her hands and feet and swung out parallel to the ground.<eos> The victim was thrown.<eos> So, someone else was there.<eos> Two days ago, Adam Hitchcock made an offer on your land for $3 million more than what it's worth.<eos> It was a payoff, wasn't it?<eos> You didn't kill Sarah Abbott.<eos> Adam Hitchcock did, right?
No, this isn't your team, it's mine.<eos> No, you are not in charge.<eos> You were in charge.<eos> I am in charge now.<eos> If you have questions or concerns, I suggest you take those up with your boss, who can take them up with his boss, who can take them up with my boss.<eos> Guess who my boss is.<eos> I will give you a hint.<eos> His office is a big Oval.<eos> You want the hospital secured, ma'am?<eos> Yes, Agent Spaulding, I do.
Anything.<eos> If Cyrus and McClintock shared so much as a look on the street, I want to know about it.<eos> Teddy, what?<eos> Yeah!<eos> What color is it?<eos> Teddy, honey, want to go draw mommy a picture?<eos> Oh, what a good one!<eos> He's dead, isn't he?<eos> And I think Cyrus may have had something to do with it.<eos> Of course he did.
You hid it from the CIA.<eos> Look, you want to screw something up? Put a thousand people on it.<eos> You want to get it done right? Put it in the hands of a few.<eos> What we were doing was advancing this country's cause.<eos> How does freeing a man like Abu Ramal advance this country's cause?<eos> Well, it doesn't.<eos> The missions before, they were for the good of the country, but... No, this one wasn't about country.<eos> It was about you.<eos> Nobody wants to die to their old life, Sara.<eos> And Michael didn't.
Okay, we could just forget it ever happened.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> It was too late the moment I met him.<eos> He had my heart, and I had his.<eos> Then ask him... if that's what love is.<eos> It's not manipulation.<eos> Even if it means you have to let him go.<eos> You need to let him go.<eos> I don't need to ask him who he loves, Ali, because I know he loves me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Yeah, they spray.<eos> And when the people come, everybody be closing their nose up saying how it stink.<eos> They can want a cookout on Sunday, he'll spray.<eos> Do you think he does it on purpose?<eos> I think so. 'Cause he just sprays Sunday.<eos> He always sprays Sunday.<eos> And in most of these area, hog houses and turkey house, it's in a black area or the Hispanic area.<eos> It's either or.<eos> Do you think it's also a civil rights issue?<eos> Yes, yes, I do. Yes, I do.
I'm bulletproof, buddy, remember?<eos> Why don't you guys go to the Dairy Queen and get yourself a treat, okay?<eos> Come on, RJ.<eos> Oh, Papi.<eos> Sí.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> What was he like...<eos> Buckley?<eos> Was an asshole who believed in aliens.<eos> You don't?
Wonder why he kept it.<eos> You want me to take it to Tammi's?<eos> I'm supposed to take care of my men.<eos> I'm supposed to be the ...damn good shepherd.<eos> - It's not your fault.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - It's not your fault, Joe.<eos> - You don't know that!<eos> Buck wore this trident on his uniform.<eos> All seals do.
Everything I've done, I've done for you.<eos> Out of respect and gratitude.<eos> And we are doing everything we dreamed.<eos> I'll try to talk to boko haram...<eos> Come up with some sort of accommodation.<eos> Joseph.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Tell me right now.<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> No, I do.
What would Sam say right now?<eos> You're as good as Annalise.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Did you call your parents?<eos> Do you want me to call them?<eos> They'll just make it worse.<eos> Bonbon said the police will be stopping by.<eos> Yeah, they were here.<eos> They wanted me to tell them it was Annalise.<eos> Did you?
Where is her integrity?<eos> Well, I can't help but blame myself.<eos> - You were just trying to help.<eos> - No.<eos> I stuck my nose in where it didn't belong and I stirred the pot.<eos> So....<eos> Look, if you wanna blame someone... you should blame me.<eos> Jimmy, you're a good friend.<eos> She doesn't deserve you.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Yeah, I know, of course it is, but what I mean is it's not my ship.<eos> Yeah, but what would it cost to hitch a ride?<eos> You can't hitch a ride.<eos> You have to rent the whole ship.<eos> The boss charges 50K a leg, Linc.<eos> You want to get back to the States, it's 50K.<eos> 50K?<eos> We're just trying to get home.<eos> You know we don't have that kind of cash.<eos> You do now.
You got balls, Burrows.<eos> You actually think I want to help you?<eos> What if I can get you the $100K?<eos> $100K?<eos> How are you gonna come up with that crawling around the back alleys of Chicago?<eos> I'm not in Chicago. I'm in Marseilles.<eos> - Marseilles? - Yeah.<eos> I've been working on a couple deals. I got $100K in my hand.<eos> But I want off the hook.<eos> Sure you do.
I want to understand.<eos> You couldn't possibly understand.<eos> You don't allow yourself to feel.<eos> I've been watching you.<eos> The pills.<eos> The isolation.<eos> Keeping everyone at arm's length.<eos> I don't.<eos> I love Miles.<eos> Of course you did.
Meet me halfway here.<eos> I suppose...<eos> I suppose we could limit the investigators to just night-time hours.<eos> - Night-time.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Jimmy will most likely break in while he thinks I'm sleeping.<eos> I mean, I wouldn't put anything past him.<eos> It just makes the most sense... he'll try to steal the tape under cover of darkness.<eos> You really think he's going to do that?<eos> I do, indeed.
That's fine.<eos> You want warm beer?<eos> I want a beer. Thanks.<eos> Hey.<eos> Alexis? Eyes up, honey.<eos> You're here with family.<eos> Seriously, would you put your damn phone down.<eos> Do you have it or not?<eos> Mikey.<eos> Do you or not?
I want you to know I'm a victim here, too.<eos> We all are.<eos> When I was pregnant with your brother, Valentine drugged me.<eos> He did an experiment on the baby.<eos> What?<eos> He injected Jonathan with demon blood.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> He's sick.<eos> He thought demon blood would make our unborn child strong.<eos> And it did.
We need to get you to Alec.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why?<eos> He tried tracking you with his parabatai rune, but now, it's like he's stuck in some kind of nightmare and can't wake up.<eos> He was looking for you, so you're the only one who can help him.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll...<eos> I'll get there.<eos> But you can't. The Clave still wants you dead.<eos> Yeah, well, who doesn't?
My conversation with Jace... Pretty much every word.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He brings out the worst in me, at times.<eos> I knew it from the moment you said something about "best friend."<eos> Look, here's an idea.<eos> Instead of trying to go out with other girls just to prove something to yourself, why not just tell Clary how you feel?<eos> Luke said to do the same thing.<eos> We're highly evolved beings.<eos> What if I tell Clary and... It ruins our friendship?<eos> What if you don't?
No!<eos> You sure we're safe up here?<eos> If I'm gonna die, it's not gonna be in this van.<eos> Not on a night like tonight.<eos> Maybe we should go looking for Jace. No.<eos> If he says he's gonna rescue Madzie, we need to be here when he comes back.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But at what point do we say he's been gone too long?<eos> We don't.
Hey! Hi.<eos> Oh, don't worry, little one.<eos> It's only a game.<eos> It's make believe, okay?<eos> Take her upstairs.<eos> And don't let anyone in unless her name is Clary.<eos> The power core's up here on the roof, behind this access hatch.<eos> Unfortunately, it's impervious to the unlock rune.<eos> You're the head of the institute. You telling me you don't have a key?<eos> I do, in my office.
They asked me to go with them.<eos> Look, if you wanna leave, by all means.<eos> I'm not going anywhere, Luke.<eos> But there's only a few of us left.<eos> How's the pack going to survive?<eos> Look, I don't care if it's just you and me, we'll figure out a way.<eos> But I won't let it come to that.<eos> I've been out recruiting other members from other packs.<eos> Trust me. Plenty of wolves want to eat at the Jade Wolf.<eos> No, they don't.
I'm gonna go tell the others.<eos> I got an idea.<eos> So this would be a new milestone for you then.<eos> What's your idea?<eos> Why don't we use that thing to see what's up with my brain?<eos> I doubt you'd find the results you're hoping for.<eos> These tests are meant to find neurological changes, while my theory is that your visions are the result of emotion.<eos> You saying I'm crazy?<eos> I'm saying you're feeling something, and in the wake of your partner's demise, that's perfectly normal.<eos> I don't do feelings.
I don't know, but I kind of like it.<eos> She had something in her hand.<eos> She had her phone in her hand.<eos> Well, it didn't look like her phone, and I don't trust her, so I told them to move.<eos> I had the situation under control.<eos> She told me that Prometheus forced her to do this.<eos> Now whether or not that is true, she was going to give us valuable Intel on him.<eos> She's playing you, Oliver.<eos> I understand that you're suspicious of her, and I know this Laurel is from another earth, that this is not our Laurel, but we don't know why.<eos> We don't.
He sees a shot at redemption.<eos> Wow. It must be really frustrating that he doesn't listen to you.<eos> I'm used to it.<eos> How'd she escape?<eos> The power went off and the dampener along with it.<eos> And Goldilocks huffed and puffed and blew the door down.<eos> That's not exactly how her power works.<eos> Was there something wrong with Cisco's specs?<eos> Because didn't we just replicate the pipeline security system?<eos> We did.
Any progress on the facial recognition from the body cams?<eos> Sorry, but the Wi-Fi in here is incredibly slow.<eos> Well, you take your time.<eos> Got 3 patties and 3 slices of cheddar to go.<eos> That's disgusting. Ok.<eos> Actually got it.<eos> Our screaming Sonic lady has a name--Tina Boland, formerly of the CCPD.<eos> That tracks. She was in Central City when the particle accelerator exploded.<eos> After that, she went off the grid, which means that we have no way of finding her.<eos> Yes, we do.
I slept with you because I thought it would save my job, and it was a mistake.<eos> Sure.<eos> Repressed emotions are something I'm very familiar with.<eos> I deal with it all the time on my show.<eos> - I'm gonna be honest with you.<eos> - Please.<eos> You disgust me.<eos> It is just very interesting how we choose our words, and how we express those words in order to...<eos> I'm so looking forward to meeting your plus one, if she exists.<eos> Well, she does.
Mr. Edlund is clearly a disturbed individual, but I can't comment on his motivations at this time.<eos> What is your administration's position on the Star City gun registry?<eos> That we will be looking into it further.<eos> What's your administration's position on gun control?<eos> We're gonna examine all sides of that.<eos> What is your personal opinion?<eos> That it's complicated.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Mayor, but 7 of your staffers are dead and others severely injured.<eos> Don't you think you owe them a response beyond "it's complicated"?<eos> I do.
Because you and I are gonna sit in this office until we figure out a reasonable set of limitations that respects everyone's rights.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Should I order something in?<eos> We might be here a while.<eos> I don't know anything, man.<eos> I don't know--<eos> I know you've seen this scumbag.<eos> He lives in this neighborhood!<eos> I don't know everybody, dude.<eos> I don't!
See? If I'd done that, I would have sprained my wrist.<eos> So what is this place?<eos> Los Halcones money laundering facility.<eos> It's likely Warner and her new friends are after $100 million that Tobias Church left behind.<eos> And you think Church's old running buddies might know where it is.<eos> Wild Dog and Mr. Terrific are staking out the Bertinellis, and Dinah and Spartan have eyes on the Bratva.<eos> You know, you got to get that new girl a code name.<eos> Well, when she's ready, I was considering Black Canary.<eos> You all right with that?<eos> Well, so long as she does Laurel proud.
I'm sorry.<eos> They're-- they're dead.<eos> But Mr. Kovar say he's still looking for them.<eos> Kovar is lying.<eos> Before she died, Taiana, well, she told me that he was a monster.<eos> And she made me promise-- she made me swear that I would bring him to justice.<eos> But even what you say is true, what could I do?<eos> Taiana told me that the same hammer that shatters glass forges steel.<eos> I say to her as a child to make her grow up strong.<eos> Well, she did.
Like I said, you have 48 hours.<eos> I finished that worm.<eos> I would've been a lot faster if I knew what kind of system I was embedding a backdoor into, but...<eos> Your timing is perfect.<eos> I just finished the compilation.<eos> This is all that we found on your target from all available video sources... Cell phones, traffic cams, security footage.<eos> Please promise me you're never gonna make a Felicity version of this.<eos> The world doesn't need to know how often I'm at the wine shop.<eos> I guess it's too much to hope that Chase took off his mask on camera.<eos> Actually, he did.
We're not done, Oliver.<eos> You and me, we're never gonna be done.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Listen, man, you can tell me that you're a serial killer, that you're crazy, or you're whatever Chase has shoved into your head, but I'm not believing any of that, even if you do,<eos> and that's because I know the kind of man you are, Oliver.<eos> The good, the bad, and the ugly I know, and you don't need to punish yourself or isolate yourself, but what you need to do is stop pushing me away because I'm not going anywhere, Oliver!<eos> Do you get that?<eos> What do you want me to do, John?<eos> I've told you what I am, who I am, and even if you don't believe it, I do.<eos> I do.
I know you think that I've violated some kind of trust between us, but--<eos> Lyla.<eos> When you said that you wouldn't become like Amanda Waller,<eos> I was worried about you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You're the one who seems to have a problem with the way that I've been running Argus, which is particularly interesting to me since neither one of us has a job that fits the conventional definition of morality.<eos> Well, what's that supposed to mean?<eos> You're upset because Argus is locking people up without due process when you and Oliver and your team of masked recruits has been playing judge and jury for years now.<eos> Lyla, I can't believe you'd actually compare team Arrow to this--this-- this clandestine government superagency!<eos> Well, I just did!
I was really looking forward to killing him.<eos> Wow. We need to check to see if this is cyclotrizane.<eos> On it.<eos> Ten will get you 20, that's exactly what this is.<eos> One thing at a time. - Go!<eos> - Hey, Thea called.<eos> She says she needs to talk to you. She said it was important.<eos> Thea, I thought that we agreed not to look at whatever's on that drive.<eos> Ollie, you have a habit of giving orders and just assuming that they are agreements, but you have got to see this.<eos> No, I don't.
Yet, the same blood runs through both your veins.<eos> The blood of the angel.<eos> Please, show me what it can do.<eos> Don't be shy.<eos> We're still learning how it works.<eos> Are you?<eos> And you, vampire.<eos> Are you still learning to walk in the sun?<eos> Wow, word travels fast down here.<eos> It does.
And so must we.<eos> I can't speak for all Shadowhunters, but I know Clary's nothing like that.<eos> She would never turn on me.<eos> This is about more than Clary.<eos> This is about the fate of the Downworld.<eos> There's a reason why my people have survived longer than any other creature on this Earth.<eos> We know when to choose the winning side.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> You've got the wrong guy.<eos> No I don't.
- I know how hard that can be...<eos> - Dad... - Just tell me.<eos> - But you cannot repeat this secret to anyone, not even Magnus.<eos> Promise me, Alec.<eos> I can't promise that.<eos> Either you trust me to be a leader or you don't.<eos> The Clave lied about the Soul Sword.<eos> They never recovered it from Valentine's attack on the Institute.<eos> They don't have it.<eos> They never did.
- Dad... - Just tell me.<eos> - But you cannot repeat this secret to anyone, not even Magnus.<eos> Promise me, Alec.<eos> I can't promise that.<eos> Either you trust me to be a leader or you don't.<eos> The Clave lied about the Soul Sword.<eos> They never recovered it from Valentine's attack on the Institute.<eos> They don't have it.<eos> They never did.<eos> Then who does?
No. We tracked the box itself, But... it was a dead end.<eos> So Valentine sent Duncan to steal a pair of baby booties?<eos> Someone did.<eos> Someone who wanted to circumvent us from tracking Jonathan.<eos> And now we have no leads on either of them.<eos> We've got nothing.<eos> Actually, we have less than nothing.<eos> There's something you should know.<eos> The Clave doesn't have the Soul Sword.<eos> They never did.
Who would want to hurt him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - But I'm going to find out.<eos> - Hey. Hey. Look, get Robert and Maryse here.<eos> The rest of us... we'll find who did this.<eos> Yeah, I'll stay with Max.<eos> If he regains consciousness, perhaps he can ID his attacker.<eos> Cream or sugar?<eos> Did I fall asleep?<eos> We both did.
I was the one to bring him to the Institute. Don't.<eos> We're all responsible for this.<eos> At least now we know Valentine can never get the mirror and raise the Angel.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> Look, even with our pure angel blood, doesn't it seem strange that Clary's runes would be powerful enough to destroy a Mortal Instrument?<eos> And why didn't it destroy the sword?<eos> What if the mirror I destroyed isn't the Mortal Mirror?<eos> Then why would your mom give it to the warlocks to protect?<eos> Maybe she thought it was.<eos> We all did.
Raphael wants me to, uh... you know, fill the vamps about everything that went down.<eos> OK.<eos> Call me tomorrow?<eos> Yeah, totally!<eos> ♪ You and me, coming down ♪ - I'll see you soon.<eos> - OK.<eos> ♪ You stole me ♪ - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> You guys look good together.<eos> Yeah, we do, don't we?
If we want answers, we have to take that station.<eos> It's floating dark, barely registers on radar but it's got a habitat ring, which means someone's home.<eos> The first thing we have to get past is this.<eos> Mmm-mmm. That's a stealth ship.<eos> Like the ones they used to kill the donnager.<eos> We have a gunship of our own.<eos> Slugging it out with a stealth is not gonna get it done.<eos> If you want to take that station, you need to land an assault team.<eos> Do you have any idea of the resistance inside?<eos> No, we don't.
That's dark.<eos> Did you ever... intentionally want to hurt someone?<eos> I just...<eos> I just remember with my ex-husband that... There was this woman Catherine.<eos> Fucking Catherine.<eos> We'd broken up a bunch, and we got back together and he was still seeing her and... and I went through... every photograph, every e-mail, and I made him get rid of all of them.<eos> I tortured him.<eos> I just was so... hurt that... I wanted to punish him for making me feel that way.<eos> You must have cared a lot.<eos> Yeah. I did.
♪ I'd keep you if I could ♪<eos> Maybe.<eos> ♪ I'd make you mine, yes, I would ♪<eos> Were you into the girl or something?<eos> What?<eos> No. No. No.<eos> - Why the fascination?<eos> - No, I was curious...<eos> Oh, yeah, I like it when you're jealous, though.<eos> No, you don't.
If he learns to swim, good.<eos> If he drowns, good.<eos> Either way, strong Unsullied.<eos> But I had no fears.<eos> I was never the biggest, never the strongest... but I was bravest, always.<eos> - I believe it.<eos> - Until...<eos> I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naath.<eos> Now I have fear.<eos> I do, too.
Knocking down too many Commandments?<eos> No. I mean, like, jail.<eos> Do you believe in the afterlife?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, my mom did.<eos> She seemed pretty sure. She used to say, "All I know is there's more than I know."<eos> Yeah, I think that might sound wiser than it is.<eos> Wow. Okay, wiseass.<eos> So you know what happens after you die?<eos> Yes, I do.
But to be honest, I didn't see you, not clearly, not like this here now in person.<eos> You are huge.<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you.<eos> Have we met?<eos> Do not talk to him.<eos> Do not say a word.<eos> Do not tell him anything.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I already know you.<eos> No, you don't.

- Where are the police?<eos> Isn't this a crime scene? Shouldn't they be all over this?<eos> The police are dead.<eos> First piece of luck I've had in days.<eos> Hi.<eos> The police are dead?<eos> All of them? All of the police are dead?<eos> Worse things out tonight than you.<eos> Do you have a car? Yes.<eos> I do.
Right over there, right at that table over there.<eos> That's where he took his last glass of evil, vile fuckin' mead, and made his bargain with the devil himself.<eos> Your piece of shit husband got a new life.<eos> Why don't you?<eos> This one got a new life.<eos> He ain't lookin' back.<eos> I did. And I'm not.<eos> Shadow made my heart beat again.<eos> Why do men like anal sex?<eos> 'Cause women don't.
You like it?<eos> No.<eos> - Evening. - Evening.<eos> Betty's getting a spit polish.<eos> Stay as long as you like.<eos> You'll be safe here.<eos> No, we really should get goin'.<eos> Nonsense. Nonsense!<eos> You're gonna love it here.<eos> Everyone does.
A poor transportee girl who's got feelings for you.<eos> Feelings that you can't possibly return.<eos> Essie... John Richardson found himself going down on one knee and proposing an end to her indenture.<eos> Until he had taken her hand in marriage,<eos> Essie did not so much as kiss Master Richardson.<eos> But when he did, she did, and from that day on, she called him John.<eos> They called their son the same.<eos> When the children went off to school to learn their letters,<eos> Essie made sure they each of them carried a little salt in one pocket, a little bread in the other, to make sure they came safely home once more.<eos> They always did.
Flashpoint doesn't exist anymore in this universe.<eos> But in quantum mechanics, the daughter universe theory tell us...<eos> - Universe theory. - For every decision you make, a universe exists where you don't.<eos> Yeah, I actually went to that class.<eos> You better be going to all your classes.<eos> So if there is a universe where you stay in Flashpoint,<eos> Francisco here could vibe it.<eos> And you're sure you can do that?<eos> No, no. Not at all. But Gypsy did say I could do some pretty incredible things<eos> - with my powers... - Yeah, she did.
Barry, it's time to pull a reverse Flash.<eos> Do it!<eos> He did it!<eos> He actually did it.<eos> He bloody well did it.<eos> I won't kill him!<eos> I won't!<eos> I know you all fear humans!<eos> You think we want war with Gorilla Kind!<eos> We don't!
No, Cisco's right.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> One of us has to die.<eos> Ho! Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> What you doing up there?<eos> Just, uh, hanging out.<eos> What're you... what're you thinking about?<eos> Wally. He wants me to stay here with him.<eos> Yeah, he does.
You gotta get out of your head, man.<eos> You gotta just run, you gotta push everything else to the side.<eos> Yeah, I'm trying, H.R. I can't do it!<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> - All right?<eos> All right.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> It's Iris. All right.<eos> I'll be right back, but... just let me know if you get anything, all right?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey.<eos> You going somewhere?<eos> Yeah, I just wanna get back to S.T.A.R. Labs and train.<eos> Seeing as how you exploded on Barry in front of everyone, might want to wait on it.<eos> Well, the truth had to come out, so...<eos> Yeah, it did.
I haven't seen her.<eos> - I haven't seen her.<eos> - Yeah, we... She's the only thing that is good and decent... about my life.<eos> If anything happened to her, this town will run red with blood.<eos> Starting with yours.<eos> We wouldn't want that, now, right?<eos> So, um, how can we help you?<eos> You two sing for Cutter.<eos> - We sure do.<eos> - Yes, we do.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Buying us some time.<eos> ♪ Swing low ♪<eos> ♪ Sweet chariot ♪<eos> ♪ Coming for to carry me home ♪<eos> Hey, dummies.<eos> My palm scan still works.<eos> I don't want to have to do this.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> But I do.
- Not yet.<eos> And until we do, you could be in a lot of danger.<eos> You really think Jack Frost's sister wants to kill me?<eos> - I'm no one.<eos> - In my experience, if she's come after you once, she's likely to do it again.<eos> Look, this whole witness over-protection thing is totally unnecessary.<eos> It was just a random attack. Oh!<eos> The bus is coming. I gotta go.<eos> We need to keep an eye on her.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Listen, the, uh, security footage today from CCU, the stuff that we wiped to protect Caitlin's identity?<eos> I-I saw it.<eos> As in, I-I saw the two of you squaring off.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, from the angle that I saw, it looked like you had a pretty clear shot.<eos> Okay.<eos> You had a clear shot, Cisco, and you didn't take it. - Why?<eos> - Julian, I'm trying to focus on what we're here to focus on.<eos> I suggest you do the same.<eos> Gents, how we doing?
I know it. I can...<eos> I can feel it.<eos> It's right there. It's right there, just brimming just below the surface.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Yes, absolutely!<eos> Yes, it is, Tracy.<eos> And you can defeat Savitar.<eos> All you need is to just believe in yourself.<eos> And for what it's worth...<eos> I already do.
It's my home.<eos> It's my...<eos> It's my family.<eos> Although, I... you know what, I will say...<eos> I have to tell you, I haven't always felt<eos> - I belong completely.<eos> - What? Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did? - Oh, yeah, I did.<eos> - Oh, yeah, you did.
Locked and loaded.<eos> Don't stress.<eos> - Tracy's bazooka...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - ... it's gonna work.<eos> - Tracy's bazooka?<eos> - Yeah, you helped.<eos> - I didn't... I didn't...<eos> - I didn't help.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Whoever did this is no better than he was.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> There's something very important we need to discuss.<eos> New visitors policy.<eos> Hot women turning up unannounced are no longer welcome.<eos> Especially those who are secretly my mother.<eos> Well, I think you'll make an exception when you hear what I have to say.<eos> I don't have an eternity here.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Actually, I do.
Clamp your lips, boy.<eos> Turn it up, Porsha.<eos> Let's see what they after.<eos> This isn't about money.<eos> It's about making sure that no other woman has to go through what I went through.<eos> We are suing Empire Enterprises for $50 million.<eos> We are also demanding that Hakeem Lyon cancel all upcoming club appearances and issue a public apology to Kennedy and to all women for the culture of violence and misogyny he and his music encourages.<eos> This is way out of control.<eos> Does Dad know about this?<eos> Well, he does now.
'Cause guess what, old man, last time I checked, you are not the only CEO at this company.<eos> This ain't about me versus your mama, man. It's...<eos> I'm offering you an opportunity.<eos> Look, Inferno's gonna be an album like never before.<eos> And that's why Snoop and October London, and everybody wants to be a part of it, 'cause they know that they're gonna be a part of making history.<eos> Okay, but I'm not challenging that.<eos> Make your history.<eos> I'm-a make my own history.<eos> Or I should say, I'm-a try to rewrite the history of you and your crazy-ass family.<eos> Do Inferno.
But you haven't.<eos> Dad, nobody told you how to deal with your father getting shot, so don't tell me how to deal with taking a bullet for mine.<eos> And I'm sorry, but you play it hard and-and being hard-headed and doing it your way, that's why Bella was taken.<eos> Now, I want to work with you, but I ain't backing down.<eos> You need to listen to my version, you need to listen to my version now.<eos> Tyree, please take this and school this old Lyon.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Lucious, he killed it.<eos> He killed it.<eos> Did he?
I-I get wanting revenge. I-i really do.<eos> But...<eos> Why wait so long?<eos> I had no choice.<eos> Before the angels fell, before they lost their wings, there would've been no way to hunt them down.<eos> But now...<eos> Patience is a talent.<eos> You'd be amazed what a person can do with a little bit of purpose and an abundance of time.<eos> Ishim said you made some kind of pact, um... That you're using dark magic.<eos> Did he?
Hey! Screens down, eyes up, shut up.<eos> - Sorry, mom.<eos> - Sorry. Okay, here's what we know.<eos> Our target keeps a tight schedule.<eos> He leaves every day at 8:00 P.M.<eos> He gets back exactly at 8:45.<eos> What's he doin'?<eos> Night fishing.<eos> Wait a minute, you called us to... To kill a demon that likes to fish?<eos> Yes, I did.
You mind explainin' why you broke into my house?<eos> I know it wasn't just to ruin the evening catch.<eos> Hunters.<eos> Well, that didn't work.<eos> Angel.<eos> Hiya, sweetheart.<eos> Run!<eos> Guys, we got a problem.<eos> Yeah, we know.<eos> No, you don't.
Dean, I don't give a toss if you sign up.<eos> Honestly, I don't care if you live or die.<eos> But since we're such jolly good pals now...<eos> Jolly good?<eos> Let me just say that the Men of Letters is an excellent fit for someone with our... inclinations.<eos> "Our"?<eos> As in you and me?<eos> You're a killer, Dean Winchester, and so am I.<eos> And if we go too long without something to track or trap or punch or gut, well, things get a bit ugly.<eos> Don't they?
And if we go too long without something to track or trap or punch or gut, well, things get a bit ugly.<eos> Don't they?<eos> The Men of Letters keep me busy.<eos> They point me in a direction and bang.<eos> Off to the races.<eos> It's not a bad life.<eos> Speaking of...<eos> Now that you've heard what I have to say, places to be, vampires to behead.<eos> You got a line on vamps?<eos> I do.
I can find her.<eos> I put a tracker in her pocket.<eos> You planted a bug on her?<eos> Look, you can kill me later, after we find Claire.<eos> I know this is sudden, but you and your friends, you should've let me have Hayden.<eos> She was miserable here. She...<eos> We had big plans.<eos> Was that before or after you bit her?<eos> I had to know if she could survive the change.<eos> Not everyone does.
It's all right.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Hey! She killed a man of letters.<eos> S-she has to die.<eos> It was an accident!<eos> It doesn't matter! The code.<eos> No, hey, screw the code.<eos> Don't make this harder than it already is.<eos> Mick, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do!
That shifter was never gonna betray his family, and still you...<eos> Sometimes pain works.<eos> Sometimes it doesn't.<eos> But anyone who tells you that torture is never the answer, they haven't been under the knife.<eos> But you enjoyed it, because that...<eos> I have never seen that side of you.<eos> Yes, well, Mary, I'm sad to say that you won't become the Jiminy cricket of the British men of letters.<eos> We don't need a conscious.<eos> Such a trite idea, but we firmly believe the ends do justify the means.<eos> They didn't this time.
English, Drexel.<eos> The ability to control is transferring from Crowley to you.<eos> So you're saying that Crowley's gonna be my puppet.<eos> Good dog.<eos> You sat for lady Bevell.<eos> How can you even tell?<eos> Am I gonna say "bad dog"?<eos> He can be unpleasant.<eos> Dr. Hess says that you have designs on Mick Davies' job.<eos> Did she?
I'm bloody good at it.<eos> Unlike whoever threw out my front page this week and substituted this.<eos> Kittens in a bin.<eos> It's kittens escaping from a bin.<eos> On the front page?<eos> It's feel-good and it sells.<eos> It's page five filler.<eos> The lead should be the planning permission given for 300 new homes.<eos> Which moron thought that was better?<eos> I did.
Right.<eos> Is that the first time you and Trish have slept together?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was just sex.<eos> 'Cause me and Cath, um... we don't, uh...<eos> Look.<eos> What I'm saying is I didn't attack Trish.<eos> Why would I?<eos> If I wanted to have sex with her, I could.<eos> And I did.
Christ, his standards have slipped.<eos> So, um...<eos> - Was it here, was it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Jesus.<eos> I never knew the smell of mildew turned him on.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why did you do it then if you're so bloody sorry?<eos> He'd come round to look at the boiler.<eos> Well, he certainly did that, didn't he?
Cos he's clearly obsessed with Trish and he can be violent, but what pushed him over the edge that night?<eos> There's no background of sexual violence.<eos> That we know of.<eos> You seen this?<eos> Message from Trish Winterman?<eos> Mr. Winterman.<eos> Oh, hello. I was er...<eos> just about to lock up actually.<eos> - Have you got your wife's laptop?<eos> - Yes. Yes, I do.
- What do you want? !<eos> Daenerys will win this war.<eos> You're a military man.<eos> You must know there's no way around that.<eos> Daenerys is not her father.<eos> She's even willing to suspend the hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.<eos> If you want Cersei to bend the knee, you can ask her yourself.<eos> I...<eos> I don't.<eos> And Daenerys doesn't.
Not right now, anyway.<eos> She has a more important request.<eos> I wasn't sure I'd find you.<eos> Thought you might still be rowing.<eos> I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.<eos> Should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.<eos> Aren't you worried about the gold cloaks?<eos> Haven't been here in years.<eos> Why should they recognize me?<eos> Sometimes I hardly do.
She struck me down on the bed, she stripped me naked...<eos> Hound: Sounds alright so far...<eos> Gendry: And put leeches on me!<eos> Hound: Was she naked too?<eos> Thoros: She needed your blood.<eos> Gendry(to Thoros): Yes, thank you, I know that.<eos> Hound: Could've been worse.<eos> Gendry(to Hound): She wanted to kill me.<eos> - And would have killed me if it weren't for...<eos> Hound: But they didn't, did they?
Which war was won without deceit and mass murder?<eos> Yes, you'll need to be ruthless if you're going to win the throne.<eos> You need to inspire a degree of fear.<eos> But fear is all Cersei has.<eos> It's all my father had...<eos> And Joffrey.<eos> It makes their power brittle.<eos> Because everyone beneath them longs to see them dead.<eos> Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way on fear.<eos> He did.
In my self-criticism, I acknowledged the mistake I made in contacting my previous family in Seattle.<eos> Tuan, that wasn't why we were...<eos> It's alright.<eos> My organization will forgive me.<eos> I said that you both did a lot of great things during our work together.<eos> But I had to point out there were certain lapses regarding your cover arrangements, which I told you about during the operation.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> I also put in my report that I believe the success of the mission was risked at the very end, because your commitment to achieving our goal was overridden by certain petty bourgeois concerns.<eos> We were afraid Pasha would die, Tuan.<eos> But he didn't.
Anything you have to say about this, you can say in front of the FBI Director and the Attorney General.<eos> I had a discussion with the Attorney General and the FBI Director...<eos> I wouldn't call it a discussion.<eos> Where I articulated concerns that we have about criminal proceedings in light of larger national interests.<eos> No.<eos> You invoked my name without ever even talking to me.<eos> You said that all I care about is my interest.<eos> That was inappropriate and wrong, and I am ordering you to stay away from this investigation.<eos> The Chief of Staff doesn't make these decisions.<eos> The President does.
- And which latent maladies did he identify?<eos> - I have often been called wilful, overly curious.<eos> I'm told that my flights of fancy are not becoming of a lady.<eos> These character flaws, he believes have evolved into my current difficulties.<eos> - And what do you think of the doctor's assertion?<eos> - My brother has always said that...<eos> - I don't care what your brother thinks.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - I want to be a good daughter and a good sister.<eos> I do.
Take care of things around here like you're supposed to, huh?<eos> Guess I'll have to get into trouble on my own.<eos> Don't study too hard.<eos> Yeah, you're the poor schmuck taking the high school equivalency.<eos> Drive safely.<eos> - I will.<eos> It was so good having you two under one roof.<eos> Just felt whole.<eos> Dad mentioned the other night the Pastor?<eos> Of course he did.
She's part of a support group that may or may not be a death cult.<eos> Holden drew an arch that looked just like that.<eos> So... what does Holden have to do with these people?<eos> Nothing.<eos> But you should stay away from them.<eos> Stay away?<eos> So are these people dangerous?<eos> Where is Holden?<eos> I told you, I don't know.<eos> - Then who does?
What if there was another way... to bring us closer to those we've lost?<eos> To follow them out of this world into the next?<eos> Since the birth of religion, the afterlife has been a question of faith.<eos> Here, we believe it's a question of science.<eos> We believe God is just a placeholder.<eos> You're talking about the afterlife like it's... a destination.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And the world is... looking for someone to show them the way.<eos> And you think I'm that someone.<eos> I do.
Now you and I can take that next step together.<eos> Why me?<eos> You said you sent others in.<eos> They all came back damaged.<eos> But not you.<eos> Haven't you ever wondered why you were able to survive so long in that coma with no ill effect?<eos> That place you spent those 12 years... it kept you alive.<eos> Kept me alive?<eos> The Realm almost killed me.<eos> But it didn't.
She doesn't have all the answers.<eos> And neither do I.<eos> You know, you...<eos> You have to ask questions, and you have to trust your heart.<eos> No one can tell you what to believe.<eos> You get to decide that all by yourself.<eos> And look, you're...<eos> You're gonna make mistakes.<eos> That's how you learn.<eos> We all do.
It's not his team that we're interested in being a part of.<eos> It's yours.<eos> I was under the impression this was a donor lunch, that the two of you were from the...<eos> Oh, Fund for American Renewal.<eos> To be honest, I had never heard of it.<eos> But my office assured me it was legitimate.<eos> Unfortunately... My business is quite legitimate, Ms. Whelan... as am I.<eos> Yet you're here with $300 million to be a part of a... a team?<eos> My team? My team doesn't exist.<eos> Not yet, at least, but the funding does...
Anyway, she was killed via blunt force to the head.<eos> You see this globe-shaped dent here on her skull?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Well, weapon was about yea big.<eos> -Well, what about the dismemberment?<eos> -Well, that was all postmortem.<eos> But what's most notable about the job is, whoever did it was very, very sloppy.<eos> Just jabbing here and there till the limb come off.<eos> Jabbing.<eos> Lil' jab'll do ya.
You went through something pretty horrible down there, whatever you're feeling is okay.<eos> I'm a marine.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> You know, I served with your father.<eos> He would have been very proud of you.<eos> My father?<eos> Do they teach you that in Chaplain 101?<eos> He was so disappointed when your brothers all went to AMT.<eos> Mars needs its engineers too.<eos> It does.
They would rather die than admit they were wrong.<eos> Wrong about what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> We're all in this together now.<eos> Hey... Isn't that your DILF boss?<eos> Oh, um, excuse me.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I thought you had your dinner tonight.<eos> Uh, I did;
I wish you wouldn't antagonize him.<eos> Well, I wish you could hold a tempo.<eos> Which, clearly, sarcastic.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> No, thank you, Zerk, that will suffice.<eos> - What's- - What--<eos> Ah, there he is.<eos> The infamous Sterling Archer, private eye.<eos> And I trust you know who I am?<eos> I do.
What are you talking about?<eos> What girl?<eos> Some girl named toya was up in what-a-burger talking about how she slept with the whole line of lambda pledges?<eos> - Well?<eos> - Well...<eos> Well, it ain't true.<eos> Okay, okay. Um...<eos> All right.<eos> There was a girl there, but I didn't sleep with her.<eos> Other guys did, but I didn't.
Their weapons are powering down.<eos> What did you just do?<eos> She's gonna end this.<eos> You just invoked a trial by combat created by barbarians!<eos> It's been around since we crawled out of the caves on Daxam with rocks and sticks.<eos> If I win, she goes.<eos> They all go.<eos> They are bound by ancient law to leave this planet in peace.<eos> - She's not gonna win.<eos> - But what if she does?
We can see that.<eos> I don't like you.<eos> It's done.<eos> Turn it on. We can end this.<eos> Hey, no, no, no, wait!<eos> No, you can't do that.<eos> - There's too much at stake to wait. - Mother!<eos> No!<eos> You said it worked.<eos> Oh, it does.
I want to, but I don't.<eos> You're my wife, and I am with you if you're with me...<eos> Only me.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so, so sorry.<eos> But I'm so glad you came back, and that you want us and him to be ours.<eos> - He's ours.<eos> Yours and mine.<eos> - Hey. I saw Lisa leave.<eos> - She did.
You can't do that.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> His face is all over the bloc.<eos> I know.<eos> But it's BB.<eos> Badge, please.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Stop right there!<eos> Did you know that LA's Deputy Proxy was coming for a visit?<eos> No, I did not.
Get on the ground, now!<eos> Get on the ground!<eos> Please, I don't want... I don't...<eos> He didn't reach the target, but it's done.<eos> They're gonna want to know where I was yesterday.<eos> Can't you tell them that you were working on a case?<eos> I can't get a cup of coffee without them asking questions.<eos> But you'll be okay, right?<eos> They need you.<eos> Till they don't.
I've been separated for six months and just signed the divorce papers<eos> I went to the bar just to drown my sorrows.<eos> Then I wanted to see if I still "got it".<eos> You can just let me off up ahead.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I have time to give you a ride.<eos> No, thanks<eos> I don't want to...<eos> But I do.
You know that's not true.<eos> If I hadn't got mixed up with that....<eos> The daughter of a police inspector.<eos> Well, it doesn't matter now cos I'm not coming back.<eos> Why?<eos> - What will you do?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Go abroad?<eos> I don't care.<eos> I do.
Don't forget... you have that meeting you can't be late for.<eos> Be right there.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> What about it?<eos> I proved my loyalty.<eos> I got rid of the body. I wiped down the whole damn house.<eos> - To prove your loyalty.<eos> - Yes, to prove my loyalty.<eos> And you did.
You have a lot of experience with the Verfluchte Zwillingsschwester?<eos> If Bonaparte was still alive, you wouldn't be.<eos> Your mistake has cost us more than you know.<eos> No, my mistake was thinking that you knew what you were doing.<eos> Why did Nick look like Daddy?<eos> Uh, it's complicated.<eos> Daddy was in trouble, and... we were trying to help.<eos> Why didn't you help him?<eos> - I did.<eos> - We all did.
- But listen, Monroe, I am...<eos> I am... I am scared, I am, like, heart-racing, pit in my stomach, I can't breathe type of scared because now that<eos> I have everything that I never even knew I wanted, I feel like it's all going to get taken away from me.<eos> And I can't...<eos> I will not live like this.<eos> I can't be this vulnerable all the time.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> It's exhausting.<eos> You know that saying, "Waiting for the other shoe to drop"?<eos> I do.
I really don't wanna ask.<eos> They really don't wanna tell. This is not exactly the Deluxe.<eos> Well, how long has Wells stayed here?<eos> About two months.<eos> You know, I didn't have a problem with him at first, then he kinda got weirder and weirder.<eos> I think he stopped taking his meds, or he started taking something he shouldn't.<eos> Do you know if he was using drugs?<eos> No, I mean, I didn't see it, but, you know, he acted like he did sometimes.<eos> Do you have that previous address?<eos> Yes, actually I do. Another hotel,
Just one night?<eos> It's all I need.<eos> Just passing through.<eos> Name, previous address if you have one, checkout's 11:00.<eos> 305.<eos> We have an elevator, but it's not working.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, I'm in room 305.<eos> All right, lock the door and windows, set the camera, and go to bed.<eos> Doing it now.
- Is she all right?<eos> - She's still unconscious.<eos> The paramedics are treating her. They say they're gonna take her to overton.<eos> We were thinking we would...<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> Juliette's hurt. I have to go to the hospital.<eos> Okay, let me know how she is.<eos> Don't worry. We got this.<eos> Did he just say Juliette?<eos> Yeah, he did.
You heard Mrs. Cutler died last night.<eos> Guessing that's why you ran.<eos> - It's not what you think.<eos> - Then tell us.<eos> - I want a lawyer.<eos> - If the autopsy proves she died from anything you did to her, you will go to jail, Mason.<eos> Now we talked to Dr. Landeaux.<eos> He told us she was suffering from dementia, and she could become violent.<eos> Now your record doesn't suggest you like assaulting people.<eos> - I don't.
It's going to be okay.<eos> Hello, please come in.<eos> - Rosalee Calvert?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Are you prepared for what I have to do?<eos> Why don't I have a look at your husband?<eos> That would be me.<eos> Actually, the truth is we called you 'cause we need to talk to you about something else.<eos> Well, we don't need to talk to you.<eos> They do.
I don't want to be rescued, Nick.<eos> I came here for a reason.<eos> You can't take on the skull thing alone.<eos> You have a son.<eos> You should be thinking of him.<eos> You're here because of me.<eos> None of this would have ever happened to you if you hadn't met me.<eos> So you think I wanna change that?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Well, I don't.
I think something's going on in the pawn shop. -All right.<eos> -Be careful.<eos> Now, Emmet, we can go ahead and close each other's eyes, or you and me can just talk.<eos> I know that's you under there.<eos> Come on, Emmet.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> Worst part of my line of work.<eos> Masks are so damned hot.<eos> This doesn't have to end badly.<eos> Well, sure it does, Sam.
What kind of business?<eos> I run a dating service.<eos> Like an online thing?<eos> It's more of an escort service.<eos> Escort service.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, is that how you two met?<eos> - No, not really. - Yep.<eos> On second thought, I think we really do have to wake up early tomorrow.<eos> We don't, sweetie.
How do you know you're not making a mistake?<eos> Sometimes, the best option is to leave everything as it is.<eos> [Alba] What?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Indalecio loves money.<eos> With a large amount on the table, I doubt he'd lie.<eos> We need another plan.<eos> Maybe we should let things take their course.<eos> The girls don't deserve to lose their jobs.<eos> -[sighs] -And Carlos does?
Yeah. Eric thought it was funny, and Danny didn't talk to him for, like, a week or two.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> When is the next bus?<eos> Check the board.<eos> There's nothing on the board.<eos> Then I guess you got your answer.<eos> You mean, there's not another bus?<eos> People lie. Board don't.<eos> You don't have anything going to Jacksonville or somewhere up north?<eos> Sure, I do.
I tried to explain the situation to them, but...<eos> I'm sorry, Mike.<eos> They're all leaving, Donna...<eos> First Jessica and now Mike.<eos> They're family.<eos> You always talk like we're your only family.<eos> You need to go make things right with your mother.<eos> Mike, what are you doing here?<eos> I thought school started at 7:00.<eos> It does.
Absolutely.<eos> I find little girl.<eos> Pro bono.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The amnesty has been extended<eos> Take advantage of basic income, group housing, medical services.<eos> Register today for a better tomorrow.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Do you know the fastest way to the ocean?<eos> For 50, I do.
Some swelling to the parietal lobe, which is to be expected, but, uh, This... this is a bit of a surprise.<eos> What's that?<eos> A mass...<eos> Roughly the size of a small grape.<eos> I have a grape in my brain?<eos> But you see these edges?<eos> Clearly defined, which usually means it's benign.<eos> Usually.<eos> Many, many people live their whole lives with grapes in their brains, and never even know it.<eos> But now I do.
Your chances will be one in 20.<eos> Pick a number.<eos> Nine.<eos> So you have a second cycle.<eos> This is the ultimate casino.<eos> The drive to reproduce is manic, it can become a vortex.<eos> I had one patient who was desperate to risk her life just to carry a baby.<eos> Did she succeed?<eos> Three.<eos> Yeah, she did.
I had one patient who was desperate to risk her life just to carry a baby.<eos> Did she succeed?<eos> Three.<eos> Yeah, she did.<eos> And she died six months later, fulfilled.<eos> Actually, this is my last week here.<eos> I'm not a gambler.<eos> Do you know any couple desperate enough to try illegal...?<eos> Surrogacy?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, of course I do.
Eliot?<eos> Hey. You were talking in your sleep.<eos> What--what did you do?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I get a little bit enthusiastic sometimes.<eos> I'll be gentle.<eos> You've been in bed all day. I came to check on you.<eos> I'm fine. I'm f-f-fine.<eos> Uh, are you sure you still want--<eos> Uh, I-I do.
Do you wanna read that out loud?<eos> No?<eos> What would you like to do?<eos> Go swimming?<eos> No, no, no. That could get me kicked out of here.<eos> I thought you were the king of Hollywood?<eos> I never said that.<eos> - You said it to the dogs.<eos> - Like a minute ago.<eos> No, I didn't.
With her talent, she could have a dream-come-true life.<eos> You mean, better than all of this?<eos> What?<eos> Dad.<eos> Who else have you managed?<eos> You ever hear of Indiana Jones?<eos> You work with Harrison Ford?<eos> No, but I do represent the guy who got his heart pulled out of his chest in Temple of Doom.<eos> I love that guy.<eos> Everybody does.
What'd he say?<eos> - What'd who say?<eos> - The guy you called.<eos> Who did I call?<eos> The guy from the Young Comedians Special.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> No, I gotta call him.<eos> - So you didn't call him?<eos> - No, I called him.<eos> No, you didn't.
- Something like dance?<eos> - Sophia, come here.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> - You're so big, harder...<eos> - And it's filled with porn.<eos> No, okay. I've seen worse.<eos> So, does that help?<eos> - ... I feel so nasty. - No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Lydia, this is a professional environment.<eos> I said no hanky-panky.<eos> This is just some after-hours energy-saving thing.<eos> See?<eos> All right...<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Well, this is a problem.<eos> What? What is it?<eos> You have a hammertoe that has to be shaved down.<eos> I do?
Man.<eos> Yeah, right. Yeah.<eos> Like, my night is stacked.<eos> I've got Netflix out the yingyang, so...<eos> Later, bro. See you, T.<eos> You maybe wanna take a shower?<eos> All of, like, North America would appreciate it.<eos> Why is Dany coming to dinner?<eos> Because she's our friend and we miss her.<eos> We do?
It's disgusting.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> Things went sideways on your last job and it threw you.<eos> But this is not the answer.<eos> This is what you do.<eos> Better than almost anyone else I know.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> People change.<eos> What?<eos> No, they don't.
Work the case.<eos> They don't care about us.<eos> It's all for show!<eos> All right?<eos> Look at this one.<eos> Look at her.<eos> She about to come over here and tell me to shut up.<eos> - Ma'am?<eos> - I have the right to be here.<eos> Yes, you do.
Every minute.<eos> Check all sex offenders in the area.<eos> Comb her social media.<eos> Dump her phone.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So you'll cool with questioning kids?<eos> Yeah.<eos> In the gang unit, half the bangers we dealt with were kids.<eos> How you doing, ladies?
Could've fallen through the cracks.<eos> They are overloaded, as we all know.<eos> Chase it down.<eos> Okay.<eos> You want to arrest our son off of some text messages?<eos> He made threats.<eos> And we can't find him.<eos> We just want to get him off the street before anything else happens.<eos> Jeanette, does he have a gun?<eos> Franklin, does he?
I'm not.<eos> Yeah, I told some friends.<eos> Who?<eos> No way.<eos> And have you bring them here and spin them around like me?<eos> No way.<eos> You may need to.<eos> Or what?<eos> Don't you believe me?<eos> I do.
You don't try to hang yourself unless you're guilty.<eos> I think what you meant to say is,<eos> "thank God he's alive," counselor.<eos> Of course, I'm glad.<eos> But after his psych eval, we're charging him with the murder of Sandford Greg.<eos> What about Emily Vega?<eos> Kick her.<eos> Sergeant Lowdell.<eos> - You got a minute?<eos> - I do.
Cover the sides and rear.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> I'm sorry, Officers, but unless you're here to pray, you can't come inside.<eos> Okay, Father...<eos> I have witnesses saw two men go inside your church that are suspects in a rape and murder.<eos> We'll be very respectful, but we need to go in and get 'em.<eos> First of all, they're not men.<eos> They're boys.<eos> And they now have sanctuary inside this church.<eos> - Like hell they do.
Sanitation worker, retired with full disability five years ago.<eos> Now he only has one living relative.<eos> It's a sister in St. Louis.<eos> The last time they spoke, he told her that he took on a boarder.<eos> He rented a room to Russell Tillman, who killed him.<eos> Now it looks like Tillman kept cashing the disability checks.<eos> The last one was cashed at a BofA on 40th Street ten minutes ago.<eos> It's right near Gleason's house.<eos> All right, does Gleason have a car registered in his name?<eos> Yes, he does. 2005 red Silverado.
- Hey, we got a car at every exit.<eos> All right, I want every staff member, every resident separated.<eos> Secure the crime scene.<eos> Not a single person leaves.<eos> You make your decision?<eos> Give me that key.<eos> Back up, everybody back up on the wall.<eos> Back up on the wall.<eos> Okay, someone needs to tell us what's going on.<eos> No, we don't.
Alpha Station survived for 97 years in space through elevated radiation levels and extreme temperature fluctuations.<eos> Sound familiar?<eos> All we have to do is patch up the ship.<eos> We're standing in our viable solution.<eos> Raven says we can get it sealed up in a month.<eos> - The Ark is our ark.<eos> - I get it.<eos> Ok, so freeze-dried meat until we can grow our own food.<eos> We got oxygen scrubbers, but hot do we store enough water for 500 people?<eos> We don't.
Okay.<eos> So, I've been thinking.<eos> Theoretically, if I still wanted to become a doctor...<eos> Yes, yes, yes! Okay!<eos> Now I'm excited!<eos> Break it down.<eos> Tell me, what do I do?<eos> First, you take the MCAT.<eos> Then you take it again when you fail.<eos> Most people do.
We'll see.<eos> Uh... but I may have something to add to the wall soon.<eos> After giving it a lot of thought... I have decided to go back to school to become...<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Don't become a doctor!<eos> Please, I've been regretting it ever since we talked.<eos> I'm so sorry I inspired you.<eos> Relax, Doc.<eos> You didn't inspire me.<eos> They did.
I took the base offline.<eos> You're no longer in the system.<eos> There's nowhere for you to go.<eos> Where's my sister?<eos> Probably best that she's not here for this.<eos> What the f...<eos> Guess now we know what your power is.<eos> - He's here.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> Okay, now we do.
My mistake.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> You've been more than a friend.<eos> You've been like a son to me.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> That's why this sucks.<eos> I get overeager, Fitz.<eos> You know that.<eos> But I meant well.<eos> I still do.
Why would you think I would ever do that?<eos> I am saving these people.<eos> I am giving them a replica of their life - with less pain.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But their physical bodies will eventually give out because of it.<eos> Oh, Aida, that doesn't matter.<eos> Reality is just perception.<eos> They perceive it as real, which makes it real.<eos> They might not believe that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
It seems Radcliffe is keeping our team alive in this Framework thing.<eos> Which means they can be rescued.<eos> So you just plug yourself in to these avatars?<eos> Hook up with our people and find out where on Earth their bodies are being held.<eos> Meet at the rendezvous right away.<eos> That's where I programmed the backdoor to get out.<eos> Reality is just perception.<eos> They perceive it as real, which makes it real.<eos> They might not believe that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
And you're right... it's a bad idea.<eos> I just need some time, some space.<eos> Skye... there are things about me that you wouldn't like if you knew.<eos> Trust me. I know.<eos> Skye.<eos> Ward.<eos> It's that way.<eos> Kill me already.<eos> Hey, you ever finish the Saunders report?<eos> Of course you did.
You need to do something before psycho stalker shoots us!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it! Ward, look at me.<eos> I have never betrayed you, ever.<eos> We're real.<eos> Is she your source for the Resistance?<eos> - No!<eos> - No! Ward, I have nothing to do with the Resistance!<eos> Over here!<eos> Well, I do.
Yes, I'd like to report a subversive.<eos> A woman with a S.H.I.E.L.D. ID.<eos> Really?<eos> I want any and all assets in the area on this.<eos> Hydra is after you.<eos> We have to get somewhere safe.<eos> Ladies.<eos> Is she your source in the Resistance?<eos> Ward, I have nothing to do with the Resistance!<eos> Well, I do.
So, I re-ran your test results.<eos> Guess who turned out to be a potential Inhuman.<eos> Go on.<eos> Guess.<eos> Ah, well.<eos> No matter.<eos> We've got plenty of ways of making you talk.<eos> No, Fitz.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yo-yo.<eos> Mack?<eos> Mack?<eos> Mack.<eos> Mack.<eos> That was horrifying.<eos> I don't know how you live with it all the time.<eos> I'm just grateful ghost rider kept its part of the deal and went back to you.<eos> You know why he made the deal in the first place, right?<eos> I do.
Some of them were pretty far along.<eos> Yeah, well, that's not going to happen to you.<eos> You know Linda from Marketing? yeah.<eos> She actually carried to term but her son only lived a few days.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> But you don't know that, Moira, okay?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> It could happen.<eos> Okay, all right, um...<eos> If it does...
But that doesn't mean it's bad.<eos> If he accuses you of something, don't defend yourself.<eos> Don't explain. Just apologize.<eos> They love to be forgiving.<eos> Thank you for trying.<eos> No worries.<eos> He probably just wants a blowjob.<eos> What did he say?<eos> When he asked to see you alone?<eos> He didn't.
Quick, quick.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> Don't be picky, just take one.<eos> Watch the space between you.<eos> There's enough for everyone.<eos> Hi.<eos> Ofdaniel has been convicted of endangering a child.<eos> The punishment for that crime is death by stoning.<eos> I know how difficult this is, girls.<eos> I do.
Your uniform.<eos> some of the men find it a bit...<eos> it's... Spectacular.<eos> may I ask, what would be my specific role in all this?<eos> The Samson unit of the grail handles the false prophets, contenders to Christ's throne.<eos> Our job is to rid the world of their competing narratives.<eos> Charlemagne. Lincoln. Belushi.<eos> You name it. You... Will be my right-hand man.<eos> The grail killed Abraham Lincoln?<eos> Mm. Yes, we did.
I fucking love kites.<eos> In the fucking sky, amongst the fucking clouds.<eos> Boy, you're unusually passionate about kites.<eos> That's awesome!<eos> How have we never talked about this?<eos> Do you prefer single line or double?<eos> Whatever makes them go! Go! - Go that way!<eos> - So exciting.<eos> We have to fly together.<eos> - Oh, my God, we do.
That must be... nice.<eos> Really nice.<eos> - [knocks on door] - Eric, you have a gentleman caller.<eos> Mom, you don't have to sexualize everything.<eos> - He's not wrong.<eos> - Oh, you two.<eos> Hey, you told me you would clean up your room before you left.<eos> - I'll do it when I get home.<eos> - Promise is a promise, mister.<eos> - Do it now.
- One that can be manipulated into selling their employer's products.<eos> - Who are you? - It doesn't matter who I am.<eos> What matters is I know what you do.<eos> - You don't know anything about me.<eos> - I know that you're officially a headhunter, but unofficially, you meet your exclusively male clients at places like this.<eos> I also know that at the end of each of those meetings, you say to them, "I never do this, but would you like to have dinner?"<eos> And then dinner leads to dessert, dessert leads to sex, and sex leads to them falling for you, and that leads to...<eos> - all right, I've heard enough.<eos> And you don't have proof of anything.<eos> - Actually, I do.
that was a moving statement.<eos> I just have one question. why weren't you willing to serve your full sentence?<eos> I was offered a deal and I took it. and you took it.<eos> - what you did was insinuate yourself and pretend to be his friend.<eos> You're taking it out of context.<eos> - The context is you portrayed yourself which is what you did the entire time you pretended to be an attorney and what I believe you are doing to this body right now.<eos> if she's going to impugn his character then he's entitled to let someone else speak for him.<eos> - This isn't a trial.<eos> We don't allow character witnesses here.<eos> you do. 16a.
- Someone else has nothing to do with this... - I'd like to hear this.<eos> a young woman was arrested for illegally obtaining prescription drugs.<eos> Turns out she had chronic pain possibly never to return.<eos> So she stole a couple of prescription pads from the hospital where she was interning...<eos> A crime with a mandatory sentence of seven years. and sealed the records.<eos> but I don't see what a random attorney has to do with these proceedings.<eos> - She's not talking about a random attorney.<eos> She's talking about me.<eos> But just because I showed compassion once doesn't mean he deserves it now.<eos> - Maybe he doesn't.
- It's not gonna make a difference.<eos> She's never gonna change her mind.<eos> - I think she will.<eos> - What do you mean? and that woman wasn't really a woman.<eos> It was a man named Joseph O'Neal.<eos> And it was Walter Samson's godson.<eos> she did.<eos> - Then we need to get her kicked off that board.<eos> Harvey.<eos> We don't.
Women were abandoning their families and we needed to make a change.<eos> We were running out of time.<eos> You were arrested for inciting to riot, if I recall?<eos> I had a temper in those days.<eos> Back then, did you ever imagine a society like this?<eos> A society that has reduced its carbon emissions by 78% in three years?<eos> A society in which women can no longer read your book.<eos> Or anything else.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Wouldn't hurt.<eos> Remember when you were little?<eos> You were so fascinated by the stars<eos> - you wouldn't let me close your bedroom curtains.<eos> - I remember.<eos> And on cloudy nights I used to tell you there were no stars because the batteries had run out.<eos> Backfired a bit on me there!<eos> You took the battery out of every toy you owned and had them ready for me at bedtime... .. to turn the stars back on.<eos> And you said that they were the wrong size batteries.<eos> So I did.
Sorry, but have we come here for a theology lesson?<eos> No, sorry, Tony, not at all.<eos> We're here because the killer of Julie Matlock also had the gift of bilocation.<eos> They were in two places at once.<eos> See, there are two victims in this case.<eos> There's Julie Matlock, demanding editor, fiercely-protective mother, domineering wife.<eos> And there was also Nadine Hunter, charismatic but haunted woman, born under an unlucky star.<eos> Depression, alcoholism, a college sweetheart buried in the past.<eos> And then, to cap it all off, she's convicted for a murder she did not commit.<eos> - Did not?
Oh, of course not!<eos> Ah, the children.<eos> They're back for their lunch.<eos> - Ready, steady... hop up!<eos> - Lovely kids.<eos> Have they been with you long?<eos> Maisie since she was four.<eos> The boys since they were babies.<eos> Do you mind me asking, do you and Mrs Dawson have children of your own? - Er, no.<eos> We don't.
Peter Baxter was in the opposing booth.<eos> Kemar Pearce was right next door.<eos> Edwina Bousquet was in the storeroom, and Judith Dawson was just outside it, here.<eos> And all of them can prove they were where they say they were when the knife was thrust into Victor Pearce's back.<eos> So just how did the killer manage to do it without anyone else in the room seeing it?<eos> - But it has to have been one of them.<eos> - Yes, it did.<eos> - Sir? - Mm?<eos> The church service, we said we'd go.<eos> Oh, yes, so we did, yeah.
We knew the only place to battle Apep and make sure pure evil was sealed up once and for all would be inside the Library.<eos> But battling would mean that countless artifacts<eos> - could've been destroyed...<eos> - So you needed a safe place to protect the artifacts until it was all over.<eos> A facility whose security features rivaled our own.<eos> Like one that DOSA had been building all along.<eos> Clever.<eos> You intentionally set me up to be possessed by Apep.<eos> - He could've killed me.<eos> - Yeah, but he didn't.
I've never seen that book before.<eos> One of your coppers must have planted it.<eos> You're on thin ice.<eos> Same goes for that bag of weed and the money.<eos> I'd like to speak to my solicitor.<eos> Tell us where to find Eddie Phillips.<eos> Fucking Eddie.<eos> I ain't seen him.<eos> How did you afford a place there, then?<eos> I didn't.
David... I know you weren't at the bank vault.<eos> I followed you to the lock-up...<eos> - I don't care any more.<eos> - Is that where Julie-Ann died?<eos> If you jump, they'll say you did it.<eos> I didn't!<eos> I'd never hurt her.<eos> But you were her boyfriend and you never came forward.<eos> David, I know about you and Julie-Ann.<eos> No, you don't.
You know, making sure there's no unfinished business.<eos> Well, of course there's unfinished business.<eos> She didn't get to live her life.<eos> We... we just wanna offer her some peace.<eos> Well, y'all have fun with y'all pretend time.<eos> Here, Suzanne.<eos> I got you this jacket with a dragon on it.<eos> It's reversible.<eos> Thought you'd like it.<eos> Oh, I do!
Formidable Aunt Josephine.<eos> Crazy Aunt Josephine.<eos> "Delmo"?<eos> What do you mean by "Delmo"?<eos> I consider myself an expert on the English language, and I have no idea what the word "Delmo" means. Sunny doesn't speak fluently yet.<eos> Just baby talk, mostly.<eos> Well, you have arrived just in time.<eos> I know you've seen many unusual things. - Yes, we have.<eos> - And you must have many questions.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Taking the piss, taking the piss.<eos> ♪ Taking the piss. ♪<eos> Have you gotten that out of your system?<eos> I'll get up in the middle of the night and say one more.<eos> Poor old buck.<eos> Probably the last spring he'll make it up the mountain.<eos> Want me to throw a rock at it?<eos> No!<eos> He'll know when his time has come.<eos> We all do.
Patient missing!<eos> Patient missing!<eos> What's with you, Judy?<eos> He knows my name.<eos> Those tracks were made by tennis balls, Lou.<eos> Get me files on Pete Sampras and the Williams sisters.<eos> Irealizedshehad me pick her up four days in a row sothehome'sguardwouldbedown and she could leave on her own.<eos> Butwhy?<eos> He'll know when his time has come.<eos> We all do.
Yeah, but the good news is you're getting a new car, right?<eos> Oh, sure, I'll just have the butler pick it up.<eos> Oh, butlers work at the estate.<eos> Chauffeurs pick up cars.<eos> Lupe, if you need money for a car, I am here to help.<eos> I will teach dance again!<eos> It is a gift that I have withheld from the world far too long.<eos> She taught me how to salsa.<eos> She was amazing.<eos> I do it for the joy.
- Wait.<eos> So, hold on... You went to another planet without me?<eos> - No way.<eos> - Milky Way.<eos> See, here's the thing, my friend.<eos> Guardian, he protects the Earth, but Agent Schott?<eos> He protects the stars.<eos> I'll see you on the street, James.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> I almost didn't.
Very well.<eos> There's no reason both of you have to die tonight.<eos> Okay, okay, okay, okay.<eos> The piece of the spear's inside your telescope.<eos> Now just... just let her go.<eos> Rip.<eos> Rip, it's Sara.<eos> Come on, it's Sara.<eos> You say her name as if she's supposed to matter to me.<eos> She doesn't.
It's a long story, but it ends with her village being destroyed and her granddaughter in foster care.<eos> Ray...<eos> I gotta tell her.<eos> You can't.<eos> This is the only way.<eos> Sit down, Professor.<eos> His heart is beating way too fast.<eos> I said sit.<eos> I know you think I'm overreacting...<eos> No, I don't.
My name is Livewire.<eos> Livewire is the name you called yourself...<eos> After Supergirl ruined my life.<eos> Let's talk about her.<eos> Supergirl.<eos> Yes, Doc, let's.<eos> Let's.<eos> Let's talk about when I get out of this pathetic prison and these silly little cuffs. When I fry Supergirl from the inside out.<eos> You think she'll scream as she cooks?<eos> I do.
Well, how often does someone with superpowers just show up?<eos> Yeah, that's true.<eos> But, um... There's a lot more important things than having powers to being a hero.<eos> - Of course, yeah, but...<eos> - Like wanting to make a difference, or having the willingness to put yourself on the line for others.<eos> And I just think that Mon-El is the kind of the guy who thinks about himself first.<eos> Well, he's come a really long way.<eos> He's doing really well with training.<eos> Do you have something against Mon-El?<eos> No, I don't.
And I wanted you to know so that you could be prepared.<eos> Okay, so...<eos> Tell me. What are people saying?<eos> That you may have also visited Metallo.<eos> And you think that's something I would do.<eos> I...<eos> You know, Kara, you are starting to sound a lot like a reporter and not a friend right now.<eos> I don't mean to.<eos> - Maggie, did you find Lillian?<eos> - No, we didn't.
- You flatter me.<eos> - I only wrote the truth.<eos> I'm learning to keep digging even when all the evidence points one way.<eos> There's always another side.<eos> Even when it's hard to find.<eos> Especially when it's hard to find.<eos> So, my office is overflowing with flowers.<eos> - Really?<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Hey, what?<eos> What is it?<eos> Cadmus has the list of all the aliens in the country.<eos> Well, what do we do?<eos> We get up.<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> Excellent work, Jeremiah.<eos> I know it wasn't easy.<eos> We have a deal, don't we?<eos> Yes, we do.
He took the national alien registry.<eos> What is it?<eos> Cadmus has the list of all the aliens in the country.<eos> How could you?<eos> You betrayed everyone.<eos> Would you believe me if I said I did it for you?<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Even they can't stand your singing.<eos> Sorry to pull you over, but I saw you have a broken taillight.<eos> I do?
How you going to pull that one off?<eos> The guy who plays King George is from Rimbor Five.<eos> He owes me a favor.<eos> Your new world is quite stunning.<eos> Like Daxam used to be.<eos> I didn't thank you earlier for looking after my son.<eos> A Kryptonian taking care of a Daxamite.<eos> And I thought I'd seen it all.<eos> But you didn't come here all this way just to thank me.<eos> No, I didn't.
No.<eos> He did not say that.<eos> He said we can't attack them.<eos> We can still talk to her.<eos> Then you can get her to realize that all she really wants is for you to be happy.<eos> And then she'll realize that Earth is the best place for you.<eos> Your mother can change.<eos> You just have to talk to her.<eos> People don't really change.<eos> Sure they do.
Isn't this what Guardian is all about? Right?<eos> Plus she's cool.<eos> I mean, some would say it's your...<eos> I mean, it is your duty, so, just please?<eos> - I already regret this.<eos> Yeah, get in.<eos> Why me?<eos> You warned the aliens about Cadmus.<eos> - You want to help people.<eos> - I do.
And I-I'll tell you something.<eos> I never considered myself a bad guy, hmm?<eos> Do you think I'm a bad guy? - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> Ohh!<eos> Wives.<eos> They got all the leverage.<eos> So I had to do something to even the score.<eos> See, now you have a compelling reason to pay me when she wants to pay the credit cards. Yes.<eos> I do.
- Why?<eos> Because he's gonna look like a burnt piece... - ... of meat, that's why.<eos> - Christos!<eos> Stop it.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Christos?<eos> When you told her, what did she say?<eos> Nothing, really.<eos> She didn't want to believe it.<eos> None of us do.
After five years of being trapped in a house together, here we are... trapped in a house together.<eos> Well, at least this one doesn't have imaginary blood.<eos> It's not normal.<eos> Living in each other's pockets for a thousand years.<eos> Paranoia, betrayal, violence, repeat.<eos> Well, we're undead, so if it's normal you're after, I don't fancy your chances.<eos> And why the sudden melancholy?<eos> Did you expect to break out of the Chambre de Chasse and into a family cured of dysfunction?<eos> When we were in there, it felt like the world had stopped.<eos> But it didn't.
This place... this city... a lot of tragedy happened here.<eos> A lot I regret.<eos> But Hope was born here.<eos> So there was good with all that bad.<eos> After everything that's happened, the city is yours.<eos> I hope it brings you peace.<eos> Good-bye, Marcel.<eos> Do one thing for me.<eos> Tell your daughter she doesn't need to fear me.<eos> She never did.
If you wouldn't mind.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> Make it quick.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Meeting an expert shortly.<eos> He'll be coming by way of Mystic Falls, carrying one of the bones and the means to find another.<eos> Between the three of us, we should have those remains by sundown.<eos> Why should I trust you?<eos> For that matter, why would you trust me?<eos> I don't.
First... contour.<eos> Where's the cheese?<eos> Fuck.<eos> What cheese?<eos> I had cheese, didn't I?<eos> Check it out.<eos> Your puke is purple.<eos> Yeah, 'cause the cough syrup's red... and something was blue.<eos> Someone stole the fucking gun.<eos> No, they didn't.
Blacks are all over the offices.<eos> - What do the white people have?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Everything.<eos> Territory is off-limits.<eos> Then you ain't gettin' King.<eos> And... we're taking our stock public.<eos> Who wants to buy Judy King?<eos> - Selling to the highest bidder.<eos> - I do.
So... to those intent on leaving a light economic footprint, staying in the cheapest possible places, sucking the tit of this department, while criticizing me in the prosecution of my duties, I say, "Go... to fucking Branson."<eos> That's great.<eos> Now, let's finish booking Charlotte, shall we?<eos> Are you an appointed or an elected official, Sheriff?<eos> Elected.<eos> And do the... the Langmores vote?<eos> Not historically. No, ma'am.<eos> I would think that votes would be valuable around here.<eos> Do they pay taxes?<eos> We do.
She lives with her uncles, Russ and Boyd.<eos> They haven't seen Ruth and the boys since this morning.<eos> Something missing?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Uh-uh.<eos> Everything is fine, Sheriff.<eos> Mom says that girl took something.<eos> That she's cousins with those two assholes.<eos> Do I ask that much of you, Charlotte?<eos> I don't, do I?
Uh, excuse me, sir?<eos> Can I give you $100 for, uh, for those five catfish?<eos> - Yeah. - Not going fishing?<eos> Uh, I am going fishing. Sure.<eos> I'm just, uh... just getting off to a good start, you know?<eos> Here we go.<eos> You wouldn't even have been able to get in if we hadn't got her out, Ruth.<eos> You didn't get the little dipshit brother outta there, did you?<eos> No.<eos> You did not.
Here we go.<eos> You wouldn't even have been able to get in if we hadn't got her out, Ruth.<eos> You didn't get the little dipshit brother outta there, did you?<eos> No.<eos> You did not.<eos> I had to wait for him to leave.<eos> I'd a been a sight more comfortable with a couple grand and a Handycam.<eos> The point is, Uncle Boyd, that much cash money's ill-gotten.<eos> We got as much right to it as he does.<eos> No, you do not.
A maid must hear all kinds of things.<eos> Er, I hear noises at night.<eos> Your tongue is in my mouth.<eos> Don't you feel no desire?<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> My own tongue is in there.<eos> Don't tell your mistress about us - understand?<eos> The doctor he do seem fond of her.<eos> Er, he do.<eos> Everyone, everyone do.
Changes what I can pitch.<eos> By design.<eos> Well, you may have solved one problem, but you made the crucial one much harder to solve.<eos> So you got nothing.<eos> No, I have just what you need.<eos> But apparently, I can't give it to you.<eos> You're allowed, you know.<eos> You are not an algorithm, you are not a machine, you're human.<eos> You are allowed to have a down quarter.<eos> All hedge funds do, eventually.
Simplicity, harmony between the elements, purity, that's what makes it a Zen garden.<eos> I think you're confusing it with the AVN Awards.<eos> Okay.<eos> Couple ways this can go...<eos> We do, like, intense psychotherapy for two years, five days a week, break down your walls, push past your rationalizations and defenses.<eos> Or you can tell me what the fuck is going on.<eos> How?<eos> Isn't the point of analysis that we don't know?<eos> Which is why I'm not in that racket. We don't have that kind of fucking time. Not anymore.<eos> Fucking right we don't.
The reconsideration of Newton.<eos> Are you listening?<eos> What?<eos> Dear God, he's an imposter.<eos> Quick, Grossmann, send for the constable.<eos> Welcome back, gentlemen.<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir, I was wondering, have you heard anything of Miss Maric?<eos> I thought you had no interest in her?<eos> I don't. I don't.
Yes.<eos> But do you want to know what I've really been thinking about?<eos> It's light, because light from this candelabra, say, is a wave, just like sound.<eos> But if waves travel better through denser materials, then why can I put up my hand and block out the brightest of lights?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, scientists think that light travels through its own special, invisible medium.<eos> They call it the ether.<eos> Yeah, but if it's invisible, then how do we know it's there?<eos> We don't.
I'll meet you at the bottom with my answer.<eos> Very well.<eos> It's okay, Teddy.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Mama is here.<eos> Tell-tell me about the fire in Prague.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> What does it matter now?<eos> I've always thought Papa started it.<eos> He did, didn't he?
It's not gonna be the same.<eos> But we're gonna be okay.<eos> It was a terrible accident.<eos> It wasn't an accident.<eos> You should be in bed.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> He doesn't look very appetizing.<eos> L-O-L.<eos> Thought we were gonna fuck this town up.<eos> Like you did this guy.
I will find her.<eos> Could you pass me a nail?<eos> You can't go out there, mistress.<eos> It isn't safe to.<eos> Just tell me the way to go for Berkeley Town, Pepper.<eos> West, along the river path but...<eos> But you can't go.<eos> Nine year ago, Yeardley were part of an expedition beyond the falls.<eos> They tried to bribe the Powhatan, Pamunkey and the Chickahominy into telling them where the gold was to be found.<eos> They didn't.
Do you know what it is?<eos> I've never touched gold before.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> It means, one day, this whole town is going to be mad with riches.<eos> You and me, Verity... we've got to be ready for it.<eos> One day, Samuel, you're going to be governor here, master of all Virginia.<eos> I know it and I love you.<eos> Not many people could see the kindness in my brother.<eos> He wouldn't let them.<eos> I did.
Thank you.<eos> I see now, no woman should ever have to live in fear of any man.<eos> So you will speak to me, then?<eos> I will.<eos> Rutter!<eos> When's the last time you saw the dawn?<eos> Marshall, sir.<eos> Is it dawn, sir?<eos> You spoke with the governor.<eos> Yes, I did, sir.
I didn't know that.<eos> I never got to sleep next to her.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> I'm not sad.<eos> I'm angry.<eos> I hate everyone.<eos> Anyone... laughing or smiling or... being alive is fucking offensive to me and they should all just fucking die.<eos> And eventually, I'm just gonna burn up from rage and then I'll just be dust.<eos> And I don't know how to make it stop.<eos> I do.
- You brought a friend. - I said I would, didn't I?<eos> He wants to talk to her.<eos> Why doesn't he come over himself?<eos> He does what he wants.<eos> We all do what he wants.<eos> He makes the parties.<eos> Go.<eos> Maybe he'll make a party in your panties.<eos> I haven't seen you before.<eos> I do my grocery shopping elsewhere.
I'm gonna go to the pharmacy. I'll see if I can get you something harder.<eos> Wait, you're actually considering going back out there?<eos> - For you.<eos> - For me?<eos> Please, don't do your thing right now.<eos> Are you talking about my trying-to-help-you thing?<eos> Or are you talking about my speaking-in-general thing?<eos> Why can't you just say you want to see what's going on?<eos> Fine.<eos> I do.
- I don't think it's the coffee.<eos> I think it's, like, what happens to your intestines when you fuck up real bad.<eos> Stress does hit me in the gut.<eos> Maybe we should have stayed out of this whole thing.<eos> Sat out in the yard, getting sun or some shit.<eos> No.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> We did what we believed in.<eos> Ain't no one can take that from us.<eos> Except they did.
Onario!<eos> He's not listening.<eos> You did all of this for him, and he still doesn't see you.<eos> No, no!<eos> Shut up! Silenzio!<eos> You don't need him.<eos> You know that.<eos> - Onario!<eos> - You don't need your father anymore.<eos> You never did.
Don't you think she's earned it?<eos> Si.<eos> Vero.<eos> Procuratore Tafani... per favore.<eos> Grazie.<eos> Prego.<eos> Andiamo.<eos> The one that didn't get away.<eos> No.<eos> No, he didn't.
This is all that's left of my people.<eos> Can you save them?<eos> We'll do everything we can.<eos> You have my word.<eos> Tell me something good.<eos> Raven's looking for us.<eos> So Luna's rig is here, and if the fish in these waters are dying, well, basically, we're screwed.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Alie said we had 6 months.<eos> We don't.
You did great.<eos> -You did it.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Everyone is so pleased.<eos> I know it was tough, but you got through it.<eos> -I'm really proud of you.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Just some questions that I needed to answer.<eos> I know.<eos> But you did it.
I will make certain that you and your sister are settled.<eos> But then where will I be?<eos> When you are older, you will realize that there is little for a woman in this world.<eos> One way or another, I must salvage a life for myself.<eos> Eduard, is everything all right?<eos> Uncle Michele!<eos> Dear God, Mileva?<eos> Mileva can you hear me?<eos> She'll wake up.<eos> She always does.
Or asked Betty to do so.<eos> Maybe she was otherwise engaged.<eos> Between your thighs perhaps?<eos> This is nothing, with Betty.<eos> A momentary escape.<eos> Some pleasure to numb the world's constant pull upon me.<eos> It has nothing to do with our life.<eos> You are a selfish man.<eos> You have convinced yourself that your contributions to the world absolve you from the responsibility you bear to those you claim to love.<eos> They do not.
- Angel, that's right.<eos> You're funny.<eos> Fill her up, son.<eos> I was told, over the phone, that you had organic pistachio ice cream.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So now that I'm here, all-all I see is mint.<eos> Please tell me you have some in the back.<eos> - Um, no, ma'am.<eos> We don't.
And the punch you deserved, but a dead animal's just disgusting.<eos> Well, uh, apology accepted.<eos> And, I'm... I'm really sorry - about all that stuff, too.<eos> Should've known I wouldn't come at you with my right.<eos> Not again.<eos> Why? Is it, like, good manners to put the second black eye on the other side?<eos> Uh, I don't know about manners, but symmetry is more attractive.<eos> See ya.<eos> You know that Bobby Dean had enemies?<eos> Most assholes do.
I appreciate that.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> Eugenia, in a perfect world, a woman as smart as you would not need someone like me to help you with your money, but it's not a perfect world.<eos> So here's what I offer my clients.<eos> I offer two things.<eos> Number one:<eos> I offer a safe but aggressive investment scheme that follows the... the way that economics are trending, right?<eos> 'Cause I read the... There's this... uh, report.<eos> I'm sure you don't read it 'cause it would bore you to death.<eos> But I do.
Time for bed.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - No, just one more?<eos> But I'm thirsty.<eos> I need water.<eos> Well, what's that got to do with cartoons, huh?<eos> You want me to get you some water, sweetheart?<eos> We can read a story before bed.<eos> I want Daddy to do it.<eos> Daddy'll do it.
Fuck you talking about?<eos> I don't want you to serve that.<eos> I've got a way you don't have to.<eos> I need Martin Byrde.<eos> What?<eos> You help me get him, and they will cut you a deal.<eos> You understand what's happening right now?<eos> Russ.<eos> - I don't know shit about Byrde.<eos> - Ruth does.
Don't have to worry about it.<eos> No, we're gonna need this place when Del sends more.<eos> We'll find new businesses. Jesus fucking Christ.<eos> It just never ends.<eos> Don't know what you want me to say.<eos> I'm worried about the $8 million today.<eos> I haven't gone on to worry about the fact that the prize for saving our fucking lives is just to do it all over again, only ten times bigger.<eos> Do you wanna talk about our fight?<eos> Nope.<eos> You do, though, huh?
- We're done?<eos> - For now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We did it.<eos> I want one of those.<eos> Wendy.<eos> Cheers.<eos> How'd that Sam thing go?<eos> We own a funeral home now.<eos> Of course we do.
- Yeah, I switched out.<eos> Wren took my shift.<eos> I just wasn't feeling it today.<eos> So what? You just felt like doing yoga instead?<eos> Yeah, well.<eos> It's not actually yoga, but-- I just-<eos> I'm not sure I actually wanna work at the restaurant anymore.<eos> - So, what is this place?<eos> - Hey, did you talk with Topher?<eos> Yes. No, I did.
Nobody told me.<eos> You checked in with the credit card. But why the hell are you staying at a hotel?<eos> What... What is with...<eos> With all the food?<eos> I left you a note. I couldn't understand the note.<eos> Well... it was very clear what I was saying.<eos> Okay, you need to breathe. I mean, what the hell does that mean?<eos> Well, I-I need to figure some things out, separate from you, separate from the family.<eos> I don't understand what I did. No.<eos> You didn't do anything.
- Oh, I've just been driving around.<eos> Thinking about tomorrow.<eos> Didn't have any place else to go.<eos> My mind won't settle down.<eos> Oh, John.<eos> How did this thing...?<eos> How did we get here?<eos> Am I remembering things wrong? Did...?<eos> I mean, we had some good times, didn't we?<eos> Mom, of course we did.

You left earlier with Meg.<eos> They were gunning for her.<eos> I didn't wanna give them more ammunition.<eos> - What if they call me?<eos> - Belle...<eos> - Am I supposed to lie on the stand?<eos> - No.<eos> I could go to jail.<eos> - They're not gonna call you.<eos> - What if they do?

Sit.<eos> Please, Chelsea.<eos> I mean, can't we just talk about this later?<eos> There is no later.<eos> We're letting you go.<eos> For what?<eos> 'Cause I didn't take those sick days?<eos> - It has nothing to do with that.<eos> - This has to do with my brother.<eos> - No, it does not.
I don't know.<eos> It looks pretty run down.<eos> You know what I see?<eos> I see the future, son.<eos> Your future.<eos> Knock that shed down.<eos> Clean it all up.<eos> This is gonna be a prime site for a mixed-use marina.<eos> I heard you had that idea one time for the boatyard.<eos> - Yes, I did.
I'll go talk to them.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's gotta be... It's gotta be in person, okay?<eos> And it's gotta be a public place.<eos> And why would I wanna do that?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Like, to clear the past.<eos> Make way for the future. You know.<eos> Hey, look, I don't have anything against you, sir, okay?<eos> I don't.
Sure.<eos> Follow me.<eos> You know, I saw our friend today.<eos> He's very sick.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But that's not why I'm here.<eos> I wanted to talk to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have a price in mind?<eos> I do.
I never asked.<eos> Do you have any good memories of my dad?<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> - Like what?<eos> I thought so.<eos> I told you a story about us swimming.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> My dad... the way he taught Danny was he took him out in the middle of the ocean and he threw him overboard.<eos> He expected him to swim.<eos> And he did.
I wouldn't call it forced...<eos> The women know what they're getting into.<eos> Now, what's the expectation once a woman's been booked?<eos> Just conversation.<eos> Well, let's see where she ended up.<eos> Well, I'm thinking he wants more than just conversation.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Who's this?<eos> We don't know.<eos> But she does.
Why don't I want to?<eos> 'Cause you're scared.<eos> Of rejection.<eos> You're scared that if you do find her, she may want nothing to do with you, just like your dad's parents didn't want to have anything to do with you because your mother was Korean.<eos> Well, why would my grandmother want anything to do with me?<eos> I mean, she abandoned my mother in a Korean orphanage.<eos> I-I don't even understand why my mom asked me to do this in the first place.<eos> She spent most of my life trying to forget she was even born here.<eos> Well, people change.<eos> Maybe your mother's idea of this place did, too.
I was barely dressed, so... Wow.<eos> That, uh... That sounds very intrusive.<eos> It was... surprising, like him.<eos> He said he had to take me to dinner that night.<eos> It wasn't even a request, you know?<eos> And, um, that's when I knew.<eos> Knew what?<eos> That he was the one.<eos> That he would take care of me forever.<eos> And he did.
Is it true that you encouraged most of the women in your life to undergo cosmetic procedures?<eos> Now that I think about it, I guess so.<eos> I mean, if I'm going to be staring at the same face for a few hours a day, I better like it, right?<eos> I mean, he hasn't asked me to do much, if... if that's what you're asking.<eos> Of course, I can't drink coffee anymore after he paid for these veneers.<eos> But that's okay.<eos> Geon says caffeine makes me jittery.<eos> And he likes me calm.<eos> I mean, sometimes he says that I could have bigger, you know.<eos> But why guy doesn't right?
I will untangle this war shit somehow.<eos> I know the high king has the power, but I will hunt ember to the ends of the world to have that stupid rule rewritten.<eos> Everything El promised,<eos> You hear me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Listen to high king Bambi.<eos> - You're alive.<eos> - Nice of you to join us, asshole.<eos> - Really does sound like you got it all handled.<eos> - I do.
So good at this one thing, I didn't bother with anything else.<eos> It was all I needed.<eos> I mean, you thought you were the one handling the snakes, but they'd all had their fangs pulled out while the real evil was slithering right past you.<eos> Something like that?<eos> Pretty much exactly that.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> No, I don't think we want the same thing at all.<eos> Keep your pants on.<eos> You had one inside of you?<eos> We all did.
- Come on.<eos> This is your wedding, man.<eos> You can't just go half-ass it like you do everything else in life.<eos> Come on, you just can't do it...<eos> Here comes Vicky.<eos> How do I look?<eos> Like the Fat Albert kids went to prep school.<eos> Do I look nervous?<eos> - Yeah, you look nervous.<eos> - I do?
It is!<eos> I can't wait to see you tomorrow in your tux, babe.<eos> And you're gonna look beautiful in your dress.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Bye!<eos> - Bye!<eos> - Be safe.<eos> All right.<eos> See, now that woman deserves a great wedding.<eos> Yes, she does.
Wait, what?<eos> Listen, I just need you to come down here and get me before everybody notices I'm gone.<eos> Hey, Rob, I got something to tell you, and I don't think you're gonna be too jazzed up about it.<eos> Did you pick up the programs?<eos> Okay, two things.<eos> Come on, Benny.<eos> I only gave you one job!<eos> Dude, they weren't open, man.<eos> So I kind of just came on down to the church, and the ceremony kind of just started, man.<eos> - No, no, it didn't.

What is wrong with you?<eos> I am running out of time!<eos> Rob, take it easy, man.<eos> You're ruining the mood.<eos> I'm... ruining the mood?<eos> I'm ruining the mood?<eos> It's because of you, Benny, I was late to my wedding!<eos> You and I both know that that's not accurate.<eos> You know what happened to me last night.<eos> Of course I do!
Well, we are down two cacodemons.<eos> Any ideas how to slow up The Beast now?<eos> Actually, we only have one.<eos> I let mine go.<eos> Oh, Jesus. Come on.<eos> I could feel it. Alive and in my skin.<eos> I couldn't stand the idea of it being trapped in there.<eos> - Shocking no one. - Just leave her alone.<eos> It's not like you have yours.<eos> I do, so...
You don't want to announce to the whole Street that Chuck hurt your feelings?<eos> He got into your head, threw you off your game?<eos> Turn the camera off.<eos> We're taking a break.<eos> What?<eos> Sanford Bensinger is on the phone.<eos> Sandy.<eos> We call it the Giving Oath because you fucking swear it.<eos> Do you understand what an oath is?<eos> I do.
There's been a variety of irregularities.<eos> Same with Illinois.<eos> Looks like Nevada's making noises, too.<eos> I'm having déjà vu.<eos> You ever get that?<eos> Are you seriously asking me about déjà vu?<eos> Never mind.<eos> It's gone.<eos> You never get déjà vu?<eos> Everybody does.
I know, but I think I'll like it this time.<eos> You can do it harder.<eos> Even harder than that.<eos> There's no coming back from this.<eos> Oh, I know exactly what we're about to do.<eos> If we fail, it's on both of us.<eos> I won't be able to protect you.<eos> And what a relief that will be... for both of us.<eos> The American people don't know what's best for them.<eos> I do.
I was eating Eggos?<eos> Yeah, she heated them on the griddle.<eos> I used the toaster.<eos> Put some syrup on it, it's delicious.<eos> So... the poll results.<eos> I think I'm ready to... explore.<eos> - It's just preliminary. I'm not committing to anything.<eos> - I hear you.<eos> - 'Cause the thing is, I'm really not sure that I finished my mission.<eos> Well, who ever does, kid?
- Previously on "The Mist"...<eos> - There's something out there.<eos> The Black Spring.<eos> It's like our version of Santa, but instead of not getting gifts, if you don't behave, you'll be torn apart alive.<eos> My family's at the mall.<eos> I've gotta get to them.<eos> What if it doesn't have any keys?<eos> - I'll bet Mia knows how to hotwire.<eos> - Of course I do.
- Jonah Dixon.<eos> Don't get attached to anyone.<eos> They'll just use you for their own good.<eos> Mia?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm your friend.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> You know who I am?<eos> Of course I do.
Say what?<eos> I love you.<eos> I wish I had been better.<eos> Don't you wish you could have been a better daughter?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let me finally be a mother to you now.<eos> Let me help you die.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> I don't.<eos> Baby doll, yes, you do.
But the kill is mine.<eos> Get up.<eos> There they are.<eos> Hang on.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> What the hell is he doing?<eos> Weaponizing the fuel.<eos> You said we need every drop.<eos> We do!
I know.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> - Here you go, sir.<eos> - You're on a roll, Seth!<eos> Hey, buddy, you're smoking.<eos> I know, right?<eos> I feel great.<eos> No, dude, you're on fire!<eos> - It doesn't exist.<eos> - Yes, it does.

She chose another.<eos> But I had already pledged my heart to her for all of the eternity, and a knight can never break an oath.<eos> Cassandra, you are beautiful, and you will find your love some day, but it just cannot be me.<eos> - Are we close?<eos> - Oh, I hope so.<eos> I don't think I can take another bug bite.<eos> Flynn, if you don't like hiking, why did you bring me out here?<eos> I didn't bring you out here.<eos> The clue in the ledger brought you out here.<eos> No, you did.
And so are you.<eos> You've already made up your mind, haven't you?<eos> Then change it.<eos> His crimes are public knowledge.<eos> He has nothing to gain by killing you.<eos> Everything to gain by converting you to his cause.<eos> That's my argument, you know.<eos> All right, fine, it makes no sense that it's a trap, which is exactly why it has to be one.<eos> You're going to accept.<eos> I already did an hour ago.
That is not your kid!<eos> Not anymore!<eos> All this death?<eos> It's not the protomolecule.<eos> It's Protogen.<eos> And men like you.<eos> Damn it, we lost it.<eos> Alex, give me a full 360!<eos> - We cannot maneuver here.<eos> - Do it!
I came out here to see what you and I could do about that.<eos> Trying to trick me, huh?<eos> Like that sebakawala who flies this ship?<eos> Calm these people down and line them up.<eos> Children first, best you can.<eos> Do it and I'll trade places with you.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I was on the last ship off Eros I didn't do enough.<eos> I had a brother on Eros.<eos> We all did.
Are your feelings about Mafee helpful?<eos> More than any stock you'll ever champion, more than any time you'll impress somebody by being right.<eos> You haven't noticed yet. By the time anyone notices, it's usually too late, but that place has a way of obscuring, corroding, eating you from the fucking inside.<eos> And you have a rare chance to survive.<eos> You're so far ahead of where Axe and I were when we were your age. We hadn't made hard choices.<eos> You know yourself better.<eos> And your feelings are a lifeline connecting you back to that place, screaming at you from your core, "Don't forget me."<eos> Don't forget.<eos> I don't like to lie."<eos> I don't.
Three and two, count is full.<eos> I grew up playing stickball.<eos> You wanna grab that broom handle and stand in?<eos> I'll get too intense.<eos> Okay.<eos> People are telling me I can't miss your party.<eos> No, because those people think the only way to advance is by following the rules and social mores.<eos> They have no fucking idea why we do what we do.<eos> I don't think I'm any better than them.<eos> Of course you do.
- Kids, please, can you just go upstairs to play?<eos> - Upstairs, everyone.<eos> - Russel, make them play upstairs.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> You okay, sweetie? - Hey.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Is Hawk in trouble because we've been seeing a Denier?<eos> - What Denier?<eos> - He sees the kids, Mom.<eos> At least he did.
♪ It's not even my birthday but... ♪<eos> You know what? I don't need to have sex.<eos> I'll just play golf with you.<eos> Uh, I play golf to get away from my wife.<eos> Well, I'm exhausted.<eos> I need a nap.<eos> After I dance is when we usually lose most of the class.<eos> Now, before I teach you the actual moves, I want you to just feel your body and let it go.<eos> Who wants to give it a shot?<eos> Oh, I do!

Can you two talk somewhere else?<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'll turn it up.<eos> Where... where's the remote?<eos> Whoa, Ma, I... I only got engaged to be engaged 'cause Dad was sick, and I wanted you to be happy.<eos> But now I'm with Caroline, and... Caroline makes me happy.<eos> - I do?<eos> - She does?<eos> You do.<eos> She does.
Or it might be 6:00.<eos> But it's definitely 420.<eos> So, she can bring that dog in here, but I can't bring my emotional support hooker.<eos> I can't watch a dog tear Earl to pieces.<eos> Hey there, fella.<eos> Sit.<eos> All right, now give me that paw.<eos> Now here's what I got for you. There you go.<eos> I have a way with dogs.<eos> Well, my marijuana biscuits do.
- I don't know anything about wrestling. - Not you.<eos> The other one.<eos> From the wrestling family. With the cheeks, over there.<eos> Hi, guys.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> All right, great.<eos> Listen to Cherry.<eos> Be nice.<eos> Do something.
I don't know.<eos> A woman.<eos> Older.<eos> I don't know how that'll work, ma'am.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I'll try.<eos> No, I understand your concern, Senator.<eos> Student loan reform is a priority for you, so it will be a priority for the president and me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Make sure that you do.<eos> Elena's worth more than you. Alright.<eos> What the fuck is that?<eos> Insurance.<eos> Just a little tracker, you know... it would be terrible if me and you were to lose each other.<eos> It's like Fort Knox in here.<eos> But it's far more secure.<eos> Mrs. Clios...<eos> I will check you in, if the computer permits it.<eos> And it finally does.
You know what, Earl?<eos> You play your cards right, you might be screwing yourself tonight.<eos> What's up, girl?<eos> Did I tell you that I got super rich?<eos> Yeah, got injured at Six Flags.<eos> Not even in a cool way.<eos> Tripped on a fat kid, landed on a skinny kid.<eos> Maybe you should go for Tess.<eos> I bet she'll be single soon since Bobby's jealous rage sent her boyfriend to the hospital.<eos> I did not.
- My God. You guys are so far out of your league;<eos> You have no idea. - Well, we found you, didn't we?<eos> - You weren't looking for me.<eos> Well, yeah, but... still.<eos> So what are you and SpongeBob Square Jaw gonna do now?<eos> You're sharing a bowl of chicken noodle soup?<eos> I bet you don't even have money for lunch.<eos> Hey, we didn't have money for gas or hotels either, but we figured it out.<eos> - We don't need your help.<eos> - Yes, you do. No, we don't.
Is she getting distracted?<eos> No, I've got it under control.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> Maybe I need to send Lenny Cohen.<eos> No, there's no need for Lenny Cohen.<eos> I... I'll...<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> It's hopeless.<eos> We tried.<eos> We really did.
No, I've got it under control.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> Maybe I need to send Lenny Cohen.<eos> No, there's no need for Lenny Cohen.<eos> I... I'll...<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> It's hopeless.<eos> We tried.<eos> We really did.<eos> No, we didn't.
So that just leaves...<eos> Three schools, one in Texas, one in Florida, and one in Pennsylvania.<eos> That's still too many. Holy shit.<eos> - Guys, Panther.<eos> - What? St. Agnes Academy in Pottsville, Pennsylvania.<eos> Their mascot is a Panther.<eos> So?<eos> That was her name for me.<eos> She used to call me Panther.<eos> - No, she didn't.
Oh, did you keep me from getting shot in the face, puppy-dog eyes?<eos> That dude's an asshole.<eos> He needs to learn a lesson.<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> Just keep your temper.<eos> All right, last chance, man.<eos> Anything you want to save?<eos> Sell it all.<eos> Who wants to buy some goodies?<eos> You do.
Okay.<eos> Uh, well, thanks.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Have a good one.<eos> Dude, if you let emotion get in the way of selling...<eos> I bought Ava that dress, and I needed it gone, so let it go.<eos> - I don't care...<eos> - Let it go.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - How we doing?
Could I get a Miller, please?<eos> You got it.<eos> Ten in a row.<eos> "Chapter one, The Fundamentals...<eos> "No short-con repertoire would be complete "without the classic distraction maneuver<eos> "known as the 'bait and switch.'<eos> "The key is picking the appropriate unsuspecting target."<eos> So we're really gonna do this?<eos> I mean, I want to find her, man.<eos> I really do, but... this guy and his family?
Next, casually spill a condiment of your choosing on your unsuspecting mark.<eos> Here, let me give you a hand.<eos> Now, in one simple, fluid motion, remove your mark's jacket.<eos> This should be done without effort or aggression.<eos> Finally, extract the wallet just as your partner appears to seamlessly abscond with it.<eos> Perfect in elegance and simplicity.<eos> This man stole my wallet!<eos> Well done.<eos> Whoa.<eos> No, he did not.
It's lovely.<eos> All right.<eos> - Well, you have a great day.<eos> - I will. Thank you.<eos> Hi.<eos> This was a birthday gift from my husband.<eos> It's a beautiful machine, but I think it's a little extravagant for our budget.<eos> No problem.<eos> Do you have your receipt?<eos> Yes, I do.
I mean, if you love my art, you must be crazy, but... Don't do that.<eos> You're good.<eos> End of story.<eos> You know I came here to see you, right?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> You think I got out early on a Saturday night without my minions of rich girls to protect me?<eos> I don't know your life.<eos> Well, I don't.
Train 457 departing to San Francisco.<eos> Will be boarding on platform four.<eos> It's now leaving at 1:55.<eos> Train 457 departing to San Francisco.<eos> Is now leaving at 1:55 p.m. on platform four.<eos> You always liked trains best, didn't you?<eos> Max.<eos> That looks like it hurts pretty bad.<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> I did.
Should I know?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - All right.<eos> Greatest show on Earth.<eos> Democracy... the grand experiment.<eos> Let me guess. Russia vetoed the Security Council vote on Naruba.<eos> Yes.<eos> And I'm sure the Joint Chiefs have already emphasized that Naruba is strategically worthless.<eos> People are so damn poor in that country that it doesn't even register on economic reports.<eos> They did.
I gave you the chance to resign.<eos> Well, now you will have that same option.<eos> So, let me guess... you've been to Bowman's office.<eos> He'll never make it to the White House.<eos> We'll see.<eos> I should've gone public with you 12 years ago, Liam, fed you to the wolves.<eos> Too late now.<eos> Not really.<eos> I still have the evidence against you, Liam.<eos> And now... Senator Bowman does, too.
You know we'd get along a whole lot better if you just accept the fact that we're on the same side.<eos> Oh, now we're on the same side?<eos> You... You interrogated me like I was some sort of criminal.<eos> You want me to apologize for that?<eos> You more than anybody should appreciate the magnitude of what we're dealing with here.<eos> So, you want to tell me what you know or not?<eos> Abe Leonard knows that Agent Wells tried to delay Vice President MacLeish's confirmation vote.<eos> Speaker Hookstraten tell him?<eos> Mm, according to Aaron Shore, Leonard tried to get her to confirm.<eos> - And did she?
No, she did offer, but, uh...<eos> I don't see myself working for the Secretary of Education.<eos> It's not exactly the fast lane.<eos> Let's just say, after you work in the West Wing, everything feels like a step down.<eos> Well, just so you know, I was not opposed to Hookstraten for V.P. Mm.<eos> I think it would've been great to be working together again.<eos> Yeah, it would've been.<eos> It's Washington.<eos> Anything can happen, right?<eos> And it usually does.
Hannah Wells, this is Coast Guard Station 142, Indian River.<eos> Coast Guard Station 142 calling the ship Hannah Wells.<eos> This is FBI Agent Hannah Wells.<eos> Mayda...<eos> To begin, I want to thank you all for being here.<eos> As you know, in addition to tomorrow's regular schedule, the United States will be introducing an initiative that would reduce NATO's nuclear arsenal.<eos> Now, I want to be absolutely clear that this is a proposed weapons-reduction change, not a change in doctrine.<eos> And it's entirely predicated upon the Russian Federation scaling back its strategic nuclear weapons in proportional response to NATO's actions, something that the Russian president has assured me he is ready to do.<eos> What, you believe him, Cornelius?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Nope.<eos> Just you and 27 other leaders of the free world.<eos> Relax, Tom.<eos> All we're asking is to start a conversation that's long overdue.<eos> Come in.<eos> Seth. Hey.<eos> Sorry to disturb you, Mr. President.<eos> I just, um, thought you should see this right away.<eos> Why didn't we get a heads-up?<eos> We did.
Come with me.<eos> I would've thought you'd be ready for a change in your team, considering how Goodkin used your mother's memory against you.<eos> Well, it worked, didn't it? It got me to bounce.<eos> Well, but at what cost?<eos> How will you remember your mother now?<eos> How will you react to her when you are reunited?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Reunited.<eos> - You know where she is.<eos> - I do.
I'm looking for someone.<eos> And I know you know where she is.<eos> Who are you looking for?<eos> My mother.<eos> Well, I'm not sure what you did.<eos> Not sure if I want to know either, but well done.<eos> All I can say is that it's good to have friends in high places.<eos> Speaking of which, congratulations on your promotion.<eos> Well, just because I've been offered Blair's job doesn't mean that I want it.<eos> Sure you do.
I didn't want to nest for three. I only wanted to nest for one.<eos> - I know.<eos> - How are three kids supposed to grow up in one bedroom?<eos> I... How are we even going to get strollers up and down the stairs of a sixth-floor walkup?<eos> We have to get our security deposit back.<eos> We can't. I tried.<eos> Well, I could ask.<eos> They were pretty firm about it.<eos> - I could cry.<eos> - I did.
Sugar.<eos> Hi, Shelly.<eos> It's Rebecca.<eos> I am the worst, most terrible wife in the entire world.<eos> I totally forgot that it's Jack's birthday today.<eos> And all he was doing was trying to make me feel better, and I kicked him out of the house.<eos> I kicked him out of the house on his birthday, Shelly.<eos> And I don't have a car, and I really want to make him this... fancy chocolate almond cake for his birthday.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> And I usually do this, like, really... sexy Marilyn Monroe-style birthday dance for him, and... Oh, my God.
Actually, scratch that, that's not true.<eos> It's the second best thing that ever happened to me.<eos> The best thing that ever happened to me... was you telling me that you'd marry me.<eos> I'm still in love with you. And I will be at our restaurant bright and early tomorrow, I'll be sitting in our booth, waiting for you.<eos> Oh, my God, this is endless.<eos> I kind of wish she didn't make the final round so we could get out of here.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> It looks like we have a checkmate, everybody.<eos> Congratulations, Tess.<eos> Yes, we do. Yes, we do.
So, William seems to have really connected with the girls in a short time.<eos> Yeah. That's what he did. With everyone he met, it seems.<eos> You know your father.<eos> Jack, I mean.<eos> He, um... he taught you a lot about honesty and courage.<eos> But the truth is, you came into this world pretty perfect.<eos> You always had this, uh... gentleness, this inner kindness to you, from the start, and I think... you got that from William.<eos> I really thought I was doing the right thing for you and for our family...<eos> - Mom, you don't have to do this.<eos> - I do.
Look, I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine.<eos> Really.<eos> All right.<eos> What's for dinner? I'm buying.<eos> Ohh...<eos> Don't make that face.<eos> I'm starving and I know you haven't eaten.<eos> Ok. I'll get a meatball sandwich from Riggio's.<eos> They don't deliver this late.<eos> Oh, they do for me.
And you took this job because no one else would hire you.<eos> Who are you now, Robert Evans?<eos> You haven't done this before.<eos> - You haven't done anything.<eos> - GLOW is my idea!<eos> So what?<eos> Ideas are cheap.<eos> Everyone's got ideas.<eos> Your idiot butler probably has ten Oscar-winning ideas.<eos> - I do.
Come on.<eos> 'Cause I really don't see you up anybody else's asshole.<eos> Other people don't piss me off as much.<eos> And Sam put me in charge.<eos> I'm official now.<eos> So, deal with it, Rosen.<eos> Fuckin' anti-Semite.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When did we learn that move?<eos> We didn't.
And, yes, I was gonna use them on him before, but I was wrong.<eos> And you think he'll make the right choices now?<eos> No.<eos> But I hope he still may.<eos> I know you don't believe that's what I want, Belle, but it's true.<eos> When Baelfire rejected my magic, I respected it.<eos> I just wasn't brave enough to follow it.<eos> My whole dark life, I've sought out those who are light... like you.<eos> So, what, you don't want him to kill Emma?<eos> No, I don't.
Hey! No excessive force!<eos> I told her I was hungry!<eos> That's a write-up and a white card.<eos> It's totally worth it.<eos> Now you're gonna get me something to eat!<eos> "Just another patient"?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Kristen doesn't scare you.<eos> She sure does.<eos> No, she doesn't.
I'm here for the baby.<eos> I-I don't understand.<eos> The mother is never gonna bring the baby to visit?<eos> Can she even do that?<eos> If she's legally adopting her after the baby's born and she signs the papers, she can do whatever she wants.<eos> I hate people.<eos> Okay, so, do we tell Kristen?<eos> 'Cause it'll kill her.<eos> - We have to.<eos> - No. We do not.
Did you tell her that I'm here? No.<eos> But she's been asking for you.<eos> And if you could just come with me to see her...<eos> I'm fine where I am.<eos> She needs her mom.<eos> She's having a baby.<eos> I said that I'm fine where I am.<eos> She's your daughter.<eos> Do you have a daughter?<eos> I do.
Now... think about what happened next.<eos> And this sense you have, of seeing another world out of the corner of your eye, when did that start?<eos> Maybe... 10 or 11.<eos> One last job, and we're out.<eos> It's kind of hard to, um... you know.<eos> It's like trying to make a list...<eos> - people yelling in your ear.<eos> - Big score potential.<eos> The... the pills I prescribed should help with that.<eos> They... do.
- Check it out. - Look!<eos> My God!<eos> - Look at this. - Come on.<eos> Do you see this? - Come on!<eos> - Come over here.<eos> David Haller.<eos> As I said...<eos> They have her.<eos> Division Three.<eos> They probably do.
We're partners.<eos> If we work in the mill, do we get to stay here?<eos> "Get to"?<eos> This one gets it.<eos> In this economy, children are lucky to have a job at all.<eos> - What's your name, young lady?<eos> - Violet... Baudelaire.<eos> - A Baudelaire.<eos> - Wait, do you... do you know that name?<eos> Of course I do.
There's something bigger going on here. - Shh.<eos> - (JIMMY GRUNTS) Quiet.<eos> (SOFTLY) Did you hear what I said?<eos> I guess it's been a long day.<eos> Would you like to go to sleep?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Your shoes are still on.<eos> Klaus?<eos> I promised our parents I'd always look out for Klaus.<eos> But I didn't.
You ready to roll?<eos> Oops, sorry, Clara, I didn't know you were...<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> Um, I was just... remembering my friend, Lisa.<eos> [Scoffs] It's hard to believe how much time has passed.<eos> Life has a way of doing that.<eos> Yeah, but at least we have a life.<eos> You know, Lisa's was... was cut short before it even had a chance to start.<eos> Seems like you have some good memories of her.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Pretend the fact that I didn't like you, then grew to respect you but still... didn't like you, never happened.<eos> You told me this crazy story once before that turned out to be true. You better be able to do it again.<eos> 10 months ago, I went undercover at the CIA recruitment facility known as The Farm.<eos> - Undercover?<eos> - For the FBI.<eos> With your ex-husband.<eos> Your ex-fiancé.<eos> I never thought I'd miss this place.<eos> You know, some good stuff happened here.<eos> Yeah, it did.
Turns out the colors have a power structure to them.<eos> Red is the lowest, then black is a little bit more powerful. Gold is king.<eos> Lee Kern was the first, and he was red.<eos> Yeah, and the red spell asks for the bloodletting of someone young.<eos> So the sacrifice of Lee Kern should have satisfied the saint and returned the unsub's loved ones.<eos> But, clearly, it didn't.<eos> So then the unsub tried to cast a stronger spell.<eos> Exactamundo.<eos> The color black asks for the bloodletting of a sinner, so the display of Robert Miller should have worked, too.<eos> But it didn't, either.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I've pinched myself so many times today.<eos> Every little while, this horrible, sickening feeling would come over me, and I'd be so afraid that this was all a dream.<eos> But I just had to one more time.<eos> This is real. Green Gables is real and we're home.<eos> Matthew Cuthbert, who's that?<eos> There wasn't any boy.<eos> There was only her.<eos> No boy?<eos> But there must've been a boy. We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring us a boy.<eos> Well, she didn't.
Life would be an agony.<eos> An utter... agony.<eos> Agony.<eos> I make up stories all the time.<eos> I could never do that.<eos> I like to imagine that I am a princess in a tower. Or Joan of Arc riding into battle! Or a forlorn bride who lives by the sea but never speaks to anyone, because her one true love was lost when his ship went down and disappeared beneath the waves!<eos> Could you tell me a story now?<eos> I could tell you 12!<eos> Diana... do you think you could like me just... a little?<eos> I already do.
Everything okay?<eos> Bram's been leaving the bunker.<eos> What?<eos> He met a girl in the camps.<eos> Fell in love.<eos> She was killed.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> He felt obliged to tell the girl's mother.<eos> Does he know how dangerous...<eos> He does.
She was killed.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> He felt obliged to tell the girl's mother.<eos> Does he know how dangerous...<eos> He does.<eos> But he's angry.<eos> You think he heard you?<eos> I hope so.<eos> What he really needs is a hard reset.<eos> We all do.
I'm staying in the back.<eos> How'd you get through the gate? Huh?<eos> The Green Zone gate.<eos> To get up here.<eos> You have to show ID.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> If they knew who you were, they would have stopped you.<eos> Because of your mom, your whole family's on the list now.<eos> I didn't go through the gate.<eos> You didn't?
There are Redhats and drones everywhere.<eos> What happened?<eos> Attack on the Green Zone.<eos> The Red Hand, apparently.<eos> They went house to house like the Mansons.<eos> It was a massacre.<eos> Where the hell are you going?<eos> - Bram?<eos> - They killed everyone!<eos> - Who did?
That was really weird and horrifying, but then...<eos> Looking in the mirror, seeing you...<eos> Being able to hold your hand...<eos> I don't know.<eos> He has to take his pills, though.<eos> If he doesn't, he gets in trouble, and they don't... the hospital... they don't know where he is.<eos> You don't really believe he needs those pills, do you?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> He has schizophrenia.<eos> He doesn't?
Malfunction detected.<eos> Malfunction detected.<eos> Malfunction detected.<eos> Malfunction detected.<eos> Malfunction detected.<eos> Malfunction detected.<eos> Malfunction detected.<eos> Malfunction detected.<eos> He has schizophrenia.<eos> He doesn't?
I know, and it is, but, I don't know, maybe now that I'm a dad,<eos> I'd be lying if I said I didn't wonder who my father is.<eos> That's totally understandable.<eos> And another day, I might feel differently, but this is our present. And our future.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And getting her into a good college.<eos> Let's start by finding her a place to live.<eos> She needs to be able to open up her living room windows and see the sun.<eos> We all do.
Hey.<eos> Copper told me.<eos> You have nothing to worry about.<eos> You didn't know.<eos> So I'm either a traitor or a moron.<eos> A moron, definitely.<eos> You always know just what to say.<eos> Aram, you're a trusting person who assumes the best in people.<eos> Be yourself and they will see that.<eos> Everyone does.
If you do, I'll see you in the morning.<eos> If not, I won't.<eos> He's right. You should get some rest.<eos> Dinner can wait.<eos> You sure?<eos> Totally.<eos> Thank you for the rain check.<eos> Actually... I don't want a rain check.<eos> I mean, I do.<eos> Obviously, I do. But I don't.
It was embarrassing.<eos> There I was, on the record, testifying to what horrible taste I have in women. My habit of falling for people who aren't what they appear to be.<eos> What I make them out to be.<eos> What happened with Elise was kind of soul crushing.<eos> To find out that the person that you love... The person that you can see yourself marrying, having a family with and growing old with...<eos> To find out that person... Is a spy.<eos> Someone whose allegiances you can't trust.<eos> I can't be with a person like that.<eos> I thought panabaker told Cooper you'd never be reinstated.<eos> She did.
We'll do the best we can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Terrific.<eos> So you'll talk to the office manager.<eos> There is no office manager.<eos> But there is still pizza on my wall.<eos> Alright.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Well, we got our HCG.<eos> - Yes, we did.
And it's a horrible loss.<eos> Uh, that was...<eos> I-I'm just thrilled that you're both here to make this possible.<eos> The donor patient's room is at the end of this ICU.<eos> And you have the donor consent forms?<eos> Yeah, before we get to that, uh, Mr. Young is going to need you to explain to him why there's nothing more you can do for his son.<eos> What?<eos> No one's told him that yet?<eos> I thought he knew we were coming.<eos> Well, he does.
You'd rather sacrifice your students than swallow your pride and admit that someone found a better way to teach them.<eos> - All right, scissors.<eos> - Instead of... you want to devote your time to bringing this hospital down and me along with it.<eos> Hey, I can't stop you.<eos> And I am done.<eos> Steri-Strip and dress the wounds, please. - Yeah, well done.<eos> - Yeah, uh, good job, Warren.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, don't you think so?<eos> No, I do.
What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> She asked you a question.<eos> She needed an answer.<eos> I know.<eos> What kind of teacher are you?<eos> I mean, you don't just teach them what to do with their hands.<eos> You teach them what to do with this, how to live through this.<eos> I mean, you take it on yourself.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't!
The chief didn't fire Minnick.<eos> Dr. Webber asked me to come back. There was no folding.<eos> If you say so.<eos> If you're into the guy, why not just be with him?<eos> - Because I don't want to be with him.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Is it because of Maggie?<eos> She'll get over it.<eos> No. I don't want to be with him. Okay.<eos> You do, though.

Okay.<eos> You do, though.<eos> But I don't.
You pick sides and defend them.<eos> You attack.<eos> You hurt people.<eos> You get hurt.<eos> How was it today?<eos> Bad as you thought it would be?<eos> Kind of.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> We have to, but...<eos> No, you don't.
And at some point... You need to figure that out, too.<eos> Just pull it together.<eos> So, you weren't into the idea of her being a surgeon at first?<eos> I was.<eos> Oh, he wasn't!<eos> I was halfway through my residency, and Lewis said to me,<eos> "Elsie, this surgeon business" is not making you any friends.<eos> "You need to think of something else to do."<eos> I was trying to take care of you!<eos> But you didn't, did you?
The darker.<eos> Oh, did you call about my eyelashes?<eos> You know I wanna die with my eyelashes on.<eos> Eyelashes are tomorrow.<eos> Good.<eos> You were always so good.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Incredible grades, a clean room, ooh, you never talked back, and you never messed around with the boys.<eos> Most parents would appreciate that.<eos> Oh, I did... then.
My dad is an alcoholic.<eos> - Yeah. - Oh.<eos> That's tough.<eos> - Yeah. Is he in--?<eos> - The program?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, he's all about the program.<eos> Oh, well, that's good.<eos> - I mean, at least he has a handle on it.<eos> - He does.
What, you think?<eos> Look.<eos> We were busting your balls over there, but listen, your old man was a good cop, Kyle, one of the best.<eos> Never doubt that.<eos> What they did to him was wrong.<eos> Who's they?<eos> They.<eos> I mean, what, you want names and addresses?<eos> 'Cause I don't have 'em.<eos> Nobody does.
Not a damn thing and nobody.<eos> Well... we're off to a bad start, Frank.<eos> Well, that's okay.<eos> I mean, we can ask me again.<eos> Holly?<eos> I told you, Frank, did I not?<eos> I warned you that this was not gonna end well...<eos> Not for you, not for anyone that you care about.<eos> Come on, man, she's got nothing to do with this!<eos> She does now!
Walter learns to swim or he drowns.<eos> We're on the news!<eos> An explosion at a warehouse in Simi Valley today injured four people.<eos> Several passersby were also treated for smoke inhalation. Authorities have...<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I just look terrible.<eos> You have the same look Toby has every time he runs into someone he owes money to.<eos> Someone you're avoiding knows you're back in L.A.?<eos> They didn't.
Afraid so, Lo.<eos> Lo? I...<eos> I get a nickname?<eos> That's great.<eos> All right, well, brace yourself.<eos> - Brace myself?<eos> - Just go with it.<eos> Em and Lo, that's us.<eos> Do you have an appointment?<eos> Um, yeah, like, for sure, Professor, I do.
Izzy, we love you.<eos> And our baby would love you, too.<eos> Jack and Emma's baby in Jack and Emma's house?<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'll stay at Nina's for a few nights.<eos> Right, it'll just be a few nights, so... Yeah.<eos> And then we'll come and get you, and we'll bring you home.<eos> Okay.<eos> I think that went relatively well.<eos> I don't.
Apparently we weren't thinking the same thing.<eos> I was thinking about killing a tub of caramel ice cream.<eos> Shit.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Never mind. [Chuckles] I don't even know why...<eos> 'Cause you want a family.<eos> 'Cause I want a family?<eos> Don't we want a family?<eos> No, of course we do.
You know, the last time we sat on the bench together, I left and consumed a dangerous volume of vodka, jalapeño kettle chips, and pistachio ice cream... 'cause I had fallen for a married couple and I could never, ever see them again.<eos> I went home and had sex with my wife, who... told me you gave her a footjob under the table and made out with her... and that... you weren't her first girl... or her second.<eos> It turns out you weren't her third, either.<eos> Rough.<eos> That's when everything changed.<eos> Look, I want this bad.<eos> I need you guys to want it, too.<eos> 'Cause if you don't, - there's no reason...<eos> - Jack.<eos> I do.
- I can still access it.<eos> - Good.<eos> You're gonna reach out to him and blackmail him.<eos> With what?<eos> He destroyed all the evidence I had against him.<eos> We know that; he doesn't.<eos> You can tell him you have another copy, and he'll have to believe you.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Even if he believes she made another copy, he still has to believe she has a good reason to blackmail him.<eos> Well, luckily, she does.
Absolutely.<eos> Clear lines of sight to every entry and exit, plenty of cover.<eos> And this way, if we get double-crossed again, we do it in style.<eos> Hey, there...<eos> Charles.<eos> My friends and I need a room for the night.<eos> Had to be the honeymoon suite.<eos> So, how do we contact Chrysalis, anyways?<eos> You don't have a computer.<eos> Sure we do.
Jack, let's keep this line open for mission critical communication.<eos> I second that.<eos> Yeah, sorry, Nikki, you don't get a vote.<eos> Okay. Here we go again.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Let me see your hands!<eos> Go!<eos> This way!<eos> I thought she told him to come alone.<eos> I did.
I'm kidding.<eos> We're off the clock.<eos> So, stop pet-naming Riley and cut me a slice of this pie that Jack won't stop yapping about.<eos> Get in there.<eos> I'm guessing the apology went well.<eos> Well, a wise man once told me that "I'm sorry" only starts the conversation.<eos> So... who's ready for another game of truth or dare?<eos> I love truth or dare.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Anyway, so, I wasn't sure if Maggie was okay, but I think she's fine, and if she's fine, then it's okay for me to go to dinner.<eos> If Maggie's fine, you get to eat?<eos> - Dinner with Riggs. - Ohh.<eos> You know, I was holding off because I didn't know if she'd be okay, but I think she's fine, so I think it's fine if I go to dinner.<eos> Mm. With Riggs.<eos> When did you become a grumpy old man who doesn't like people?<eos> I like people.<eos> I don't like Riggs.<eos> If you want to go to dinner with the guy, go to dinner.<eos> If you don't, don't.
I'm trying to remember what the protocol is, and if you stop with the questions, I might remember it.<eos> You're sure there is a protocol?<eos> - I mean... - J...<eos> Stop.<eos> Oh, there's a protocol.<eos> Oh, hey, don't mind me.<eos> I'm sure you have all the answers.<eos> I'll just be over here, all gnarled up.<eos> Do you know what the TB protocol is?<eos> Well, in fact, I do.
They're your friends, Owen, from... before.<eos> They're your friends.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, you saved a family today.<eos> I did.<eos> Well, things are looking up for me, too.<eos> - I got a date tonight. - Oh!<eos> Is it someone in the hospital?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Your face did.
Everyone seems to be stable.<eos> Max has regained consciousness.<eos> Yep.<eos> For now.<eos> I'm going to recline you back.<eos> Everything I said, the stuff we were fighting about earlier, I take it back, all of it.<eos> I-I thought I'd lost you, Max.<eos> I mean, for a minute there, I thought you died.<eos> I thought all of us were going to die.<eos> We didn't.
What?<eos> - I'll open up his vessels.<eos> It could save his life. Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Excuse me. Excuse me.<eos> Did you say erectile-dysfunction drugs?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Hopefully somebody on board has some.<eos> Well, actually... we do.
- It's okay.<eos> What if they're all dead?<eos> They're not.<eos> But what if they are?<eos> We haven't seen or heard from anyone.<eos> They're fine.<eos> She's the only friend I have.<eos> She's okay.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
What if they're all dead?<eos> They're not.<eos> But what if they are?<eos> We haven't seen or heard from anyone.<eos> They're fine.<eos> She's the only friend I have.<eos> She's okay.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
I'm gonna get you out, okay?<eos> He says he's gonna get us out.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Soldier boy says thanks.<eos> Do you by any chance know how to hot-wire a car?<eos> Oh, what, just because I was in jail, - I'm also a car thief, right? - Shh, shh.<eos> You want to ask the black guy next? S-Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Of course I do.
Priests get scared, too.<eos> I don't know if you know this, but I've known your mother a very long time.<eos> She loved coming here when she was younger.<eos> We all need an escape, and this was hers.<eos> You mean from my Dad.<eos> Maybe she was seeking someone who loved her unconditionally.<eos> Creep.<eos> God.<eos> But God doesn't love me.<eos> Of course He does.
I met him after you left.<eos> He tried to kill me.<eos> I'm Jonah?<eos> You're Jonah.<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> I, uh... I went to my mother's house, wanted to run away.<eos> And my mom was there.<eos> Or you know.<eos> And she wanted to help me die, and I didn't want to, and I was so surprised that I didn't, 'cause I have nothing to live for.<eos> Except... Except maybe... maybe I do.
That's what we need to find out.<eos> Will you excuse us?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He knows what he's doing.<eos> He better.<eos> That bad, huh?<eos> Angie.<eos> Don't.<eos> You cut the camera feed?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Yeah, no, we're all good.<eos> Where did this come from?<eos> You'd be amazed what this place has in its storage closet.<eos> Davy Crockett?<eos> What did I miss?<eos> Turns out our agency has a pedigree.<eos> Paul Jennings, Davy Crockett, sacagawea.<eos> Every one of them is an American hero, and they all worked right here in this room together.<eos> I always thought Daniel Boone was the one who wore the fur cap.<eos> Technically, they both did.
The library.<eos> Lab.<eos> There's a secret entrance behind that grating that leads down to the tunnel system.<eos> What secret base is complete without one?<eos> Your desk?<eos> My sister used to post up here.<eos> Loved her coffee. From the way Crane talks about her, she...<eos> She was something special.<eos> They had something special.<eos> We all did.
It's good to see you, Dee.<eos> I can't believe how big she's gotten.<eos> That's what kids do, they grow up.<eos> Yeah, I've been meaning to check in more.<eos> Two years.<eos> It's been two years since she's seen you, Mitch.<eos> I know, but it's not like I could just pop over from Afghanistan for the weekend.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> I know.<eos> - So does Molly. - Mm.
She's a tough little girl.<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> She may need to be in times to come.<eos> Especially since the party may soon be over.<eos> Dreyfuss is alive, and Jobe is in the wind.<eos> Is there any indication what they have planned?<eos> No, but it can't be good.<eos> I know no one wants to confront the reality of the situation, but the fact of the matter is that it falls to us to act in the best interest of Dreyfuss Enterprises.<eos> We've had no contact with Malcolm for days, and serious decisions need to be made, so...<eos> Yes, they do.
It's mine, too, but I don't have enough to create a weapon.<eos> I've got a plan for that.<eos> But first we need to draw the creature, and the puzzle box is a pile of splinters.<eos> I can 3-D-print a replica.<eos> I mean, not out of enchanted teakwood, but it might be able to hold the demon for a little bit, if at all.<eos> As long as it will lure it towards us.<eos> Look, I'll research the correct symbology to paint in gold leaf onto your version of the box.<eos> Very good.<eos> Now, Miss Jenny, you say you have a plan to procure enough gold to make weaponry.<eos> I do.
So it stands to reason... it could be the Totem of War.<eos> We're not that far from where that barn used to be.<eos> We need to get to it before Dreyfuss' agent can.<eos> I'm gonna hang back here.<eos> If Alex, Jake and I put our heads together, we might be able to beat Dreyfuss' encryption and find out where he is.<eos> Very good.<eos> Godspeed, all.<eos> This can't be possible.<eos> You said it burned down.<eos> Well, it did.
That I'll never be alone.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I think so.<eos> Crane... did you reach him?<eos> Yes.<eos> He's free.<eos> Okay.<eos> And he told me to tell you something.<eos> He told me that you should let Molly have that new cell phone that she's been asking for.<eos> - He did, did he?
♪ When we're out together ♪<eos> ♪ Dancing cheek to cheek. ♪<eos> Welcome to my humble home, Witnesses.<eos> It took 10,000 wretched souls an eternity to craft it by hand.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> Are we to assume you are... the biblical Satan?<eos> The serpent who tempted Eve?<eos> Why box myself in with definitions?<eos> I'm the Devil you know.<eos> And many you don't.
Perhaps now would be a good time to have a chat?<eos> I don't feel much like talking.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> men share their feelings.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> My wife has spent the past 14 years raising our son by herself.<eos> And it is Captain Hunter's fault. and still he asked me to abandon mine.<eos> He doesn't have a family.<eos> he did.
grudgingly.<eos> I don't trust him.<eos> Agreed. does 38 degrees sound right to you?<eos> but without more time I...<eos> I can't be certain.<eos> We haven't gotten any time.<eos> Someone needs to make a decision.<eos> Ms. Lance.<eos> You're the Captain. after everything that he's done?<eos> I do.
Idiot.<eos> Mick, we gotta go.<eos> Look, this is a heist.<eos> We have to steal the other pieces of the spear and get out of here.<eos> You think this is what Snart wants?<eos> You waiting around so that you can get caught?<eos> Probably not.<eos> Hold on a sec.<eos> That looks like something you might hide something in.<eos> Yes, it does.
Eh... it's a long story.<eos> I enjoy long stories. Yeah, he does.<eos> In short, my fellow travelers and I...<eos> Fellowship, if you will.<eos> We're on a journey to destroy an object.<eos> One which would bring the bearer unimaginable power.<eos> Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> I came across numerous obscure references to it in my studies.<eos> Of course, such a divine artifact could never actually exist.<eos> But it does.
Impossible.<eos> You need the blood of Christ to destroy it.<eos> That's why Rip broke it up into so many pieces.<eos> Unless he figured out there's another way, by incinerating it.<eos> But why would Thawne want to destroy the Spear?<eos> No.<eos> If he destroys the Spear, that means this reality cannot be rewritten.<eos> Okay, we better get that Spear before he can make that happen.<eos> But even if we find it, we don't know how to access its powers.<eos> Rory does.
She was hired to put together a rowing machine. Instead she took apart my will to live."<eos> Then a soft-serve chocolate ice cream emoji, so thank you for that.<eos> No, that's not--<eos> Forget it.<eos> I know it's hard, but you're so lucky, Xan.<eos> I would die to come here!<eos> Stop trying to cheer me up by saying you'll die.<eos> Right now, it probably feels like the world is ending, but I know if you don't give up and you think positive, things will work out.<eos> -I want to fight you.<eos> -No, you don't.

Please... Eeny-meeny-miny-mo. Catch a piggy by the toe.<eos> If she screams...<eos> Please!<eos> ... let her go.<eos> Eeny-meeny-miny... mo.<eos> This is where Felicia was last seen.<eos> No obvious signs of a struggle.<eos> No, but maybe the assailant or assailants were able to disable Felicia quickly before she could put up a fight.<eos> In a space this open, no one saw anything?<eos> Maybe someone did.
Clara said they got a suspect they're checking out.<eos> How can suspect know anything about Ripper?<eos> We're about to find out.<eos> What is this place?<eos> This where things go to disappear.<eos> Da.<eos> Old friends come to visit... It warms the heart.<eos> You two must be in real trouble, you come down here.<eos> We have some questions for you.<eos> Of course you do.
If he left it out in the open like this on purpose, he may be making a statement.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Judging by the lacerations, the unsub was really pissed off at this victim.<eos> So much so, he missed something.<eos> Uh, hey, do you have an ICM scanner?<eos> Right here.<eos> The second victim is Brent Miller, date of birth, May 15, 1982.<eos> I asked Garcia to find out what she can about him.<eos> How'd they make the I.D.?<eos> Oh, he did an ICM.
Technophobe.<eos> So, what do we think of this case?<eos> It's a loser.<eos> The plaintiff is Adam's widow, married less than a year, also an employee at Ejetto.<eos> All they have to prove is that it was negligence that caused the death.<eos> Much as I hate to agree, juries get lost in technobabble, so they're likely to find for a young widow over big tech.<eos> But this case has a young woman behind it, and Ginny has accomplished more in her first 26 years than most do in an entire lifetime.<eos> Who knows what she's gonna do in the next 26?<eos> You really think she's going to make that big of an impact?<eos> I do.
More than just a flaw.<eos> But it doesn't exonerate her.<eos> Look, DNA can prove that you did touch a gun, but it can't prove that you didn't... or, in this case, that anyone did.<eos> The sample's contaminated.<eos> Still pokes a huge hole in the case against Sophie.<eos> It's enough to get her a retrial.<eos> We're not getting her a retrial.<eos> We're getting her out.<eos> - We need to be reasonable.<eos> - No, we don't.
I was abroad, studying in Spain.<eos> I dropped out the week after Travis raped me.<eos> Transferred out of state the next semester.<eos> I just needed to get as far away as I could.<eos> But I did follow Sophie's trial, and I was devastated when she was convicted.<eos> But he deserves it.<eos> He deserved it.<eos> He deserves to rot in hell.<eos> You're right.<eos> He does.
- That's okay.<eos> So... do you like movies?<eos> Depends on the movie.<eos> I'm the exact same way.<eos> It being a movie doesn't mean I'm gonna like it.<eos> Would you care for some wine or a cocktail tonight?<eos> Uh, just water, please.<eos> Just water, please.<eos> I love water.<eos> I do.
It must be fair, or you can keep her.<eos> You talk of your woman like you do not care.<eos> She is important to me, of course, but she has a price, beyond which I cannot go.<eos> I will not go.<eos> Then name it.<eos> Name this price.<eos> 100lb weight of silver.<eos> My lands can afford no more.<eos> Does this man speak for Alfred?<eos> He does not.
But if you were not such a disappointment, Aethelwold, I may have had you killed.<eos> For the good of Wessex.<eos> Never doubt it, every decision I make is for my country.<eos> Yes, Lord.<eos> I understand completely.<eos> Lord Odda.<eos> You will set tongues wagging, drinking with the peasants.<eos> Let them wag if it please them.<eos> You asked me some days ago if I agree with the payment of a ransom.<eos> I do not.
I didn't mean it.<eos> - Walk away from this.<eos> - I can't.<eos> You can. You just won't.<eos> Take it from me, I'm offering you a life line here.<eos> Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and forget about all of this.<eos> I lost my daughter because of my obsession.<eos> What will you lose because of your obsession?<eos> I will never close my eyes, Owen.<eos> And up until last week, you didn't, either.
What will you lose because of your obsession?<eos> I will never close my eyes, Owen.<eos> And up until last week, you didn't, either.<eos> As much as I've missed you, this was a bad idea, meeting here.<eos> Philip, please, as if anybody's gonna recognize you at the Gold Leaf in Williamsburg, Virginia, on Waffle Wednesday.<eos> Just pretend we're two old friends.<eos> We are old friends.<eos> Oh, there we go. That's the spirit.<eos> Now, just breathe, relax, have a coffee, enjoy my company.<eos> You usually do.
So, who's gonna get to me first? You or them?<eos> I want you to tell me everything you know about this, about what's happening. Why?<eos> Because one of us is getting pulled out there soon.<eos> Listen, I know you never thought I was cut out for this job, but I was, and I am.<eos> So finish what you started telling me on the way to the bunker.<eos> Prove to me I didn't get shot for nothing.<eos> Splendid, so we got a wanted man on the loose in Munich, multiple intelligence agencies looking for him, and no idea where he is.<eos> We didn't prepare for this.<eos> We don't have a plan.<eos> But we do.
What if not all of them are guilty?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You get him to the rendezvous point.<eos> - I'll meet you there.<eos> Is this what you wanted?<eos> Not just get yourself killed, but your recruits, too?<eos> How do we even know they're Bundes... Bundes...<eos> Bundesnachrichtendienst?<eos> We don't.
This is wrong.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Gunned down on her way home from work?<eos> Who deserves that?<eos> After everything you've been through, you should be stronger than this.<eos> And after everything you've been through, you should know better.<eos> This... This is a person.<eos> I don't know who she is. I don't know what she did...<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't.

But if you really don't want to die, if you really want to get through this, you have to stop lying to me, to them, to yourself.<eos> It wasn't all lies.<eos> I did have something for you at the hotel.<eos> I hacked Lydia's e-mails.<eos> Those are her communications with recruits at the Farm, past and present.<eos> SDRs, test aliases, recruiting assets.<eos> This is your curriculum.<eos> They're encrypted.<eos> It's a code very few people would recognize.<eos> But you do.
Doctor..<eos> Dark!<eos> Doctor!<eos> Look, a stone cairn - Pictish civilisation.<eos> The bird!<eos> What about it?<eos> It said "dark".<eos> Yes, well that's why we're hurrying, because there's not much light at this time of day.<eos> But it talked!<eos> Well, of course it did.

All crows talk.<eos> They don't talk in the future.<eos> Course they do.
I don't walk out of here in 30 seconds, you'll never see your diamonds again.<eos> Giannusa's not with them.<eos> Pay up.<eos> Bollocks.<eos> You may want to call your boss.<eos> What the hell are you saying?<eos> What?<eos> Hey.<eos> You said the diamonds would be at the warehouse.<eos> No, I didn't.
Yeah.<eos> No, I mean it.<eos> The... the things I deal with with families...<eos> I'm not saying it's the same as yours.<eos> No one's is the same as mine.<eos> You'd be surprised how many people feel that way.<eos> This might help you understand them a little bit.<eos> Marx?<eos> I thought he hated religion.<eos> Uh, h-he did.
Revenge isn't that important.<eos> And I don't think it would be to Frank.<eos> He would want revenge.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi, Henry.<eos> Can I talk to you guys for a second?<eos> S-Sure.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> S-So... you know how I've been doing really well at school recently?<eos> We sure do.
Men.<eos> Nobody suitable.<eos> Well, as soon as your language improves, we'll see to it that we find you a job at a paper or in publishing, translating.<eos> Y-You'll meet people.<eos> Clark thinks about you, Martha.<eos> He wanted to send you a letter, but it's not allowed.<eos> He's the reason I talked to your parents.<eos> He insisted.<eos> He wants what's best for you.<eos> We all do.
I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I f- - I failed you.<eos> I failed my people.<eos> Everything you've been through, your family, your country... you're special, Tuan.<eos> I admire you.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> You're fighting so things like that won't happen to other people.<eos> I wish I could tell you it gets easier.<eos> It doesn't.
- Great. - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Good night. - Bye. See ya.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Good night.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why does this bother you so much?<eos> It just does.<eos> The Centre has nothing to do with them, come on.<eos> And so what if they do?
- What are you talking about?<eos> I don't know... I don't know what you're talk...<eos> Where's the signal?<eos> Get it back.<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> - Jiya, try it.<eos> - I just want to talk.<eos> - Want to talk about what, okay?<eos> I came to you 'cause you said that you had a way to end all of this.<eos> And I do.
And you make it through another show.<eos> And that way you get days like today, where it all seems like it was meant to be.<eos> Happy anniversary to show business audience of over 20 years.<eos> I love you all far more deeply than the day we first met, and the fact that we all still have the free will to abandon each other at any given moment... makes it all the more compelling.<eos> I'm back, I came back!<eos> But I don't, it's my special, but I don't want to come back, but I'm coming back!<eos> No, okay, okay.<eos> No, no! No!<eos> But what if I didn't come back?<eos> But I did, I did.
It's okay, Jay.<eos> Some boys have different gifts.<eos> Let me get the door.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> - Hi. Can I help you?<eos> - I'm here for Lily.<eos> I always knew this day would come.<eos> Probably not what she's here for.<eos> How do you know our daughter?<eos> I don't.
Really?<eos> 'Cause I have an offer ready to go.<eos> - You say the word, I hit "send."<eos> - Do it.<eos> I've been looking for investment opportunities.<eos> If you're confident, I'm confident.<eos> Because you know what I'd do to you if you blew my money.<eos> All right, you are about to get an important lesson on self-reliance, young lady.<eos> I know he's serious when he calls me "young lady."<eos> My dad did the same thing. Okay.
"Place order."<eos> What did you say, baby?<eos> - Drawer's fixed.<eos> - What the hell? !<eos> Don't sneak up on people like that.<eos> I'm liable to have knocked you out.<eos> - I doubt it.<eos> - I was gonna fix that, anyway.<eos> Ay. Like you were going to clean the gutter?<eos> Coach Gary did it already.
Butch Cassidy and his head of business development.<eos> Oh, wow, another Western reference.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - You know, he'd hire you, too.<eos> - What?<eos> All you have to do is admit that you want the job.<eos> And, like, get down on your knees and beg.<eos> Says the guy who's romancing a woman through a phone that isn't even on.<eos> A woman that he described to me in private as a skinny little fuck factory.<eos> Oh, no, I didn't. God.
I want everyone to know I haven't been harmed... and the workers here have assured me that I will only be held as their honored guest until Hooli has met their very reasonable request for fair wages and for humane conditions.<eos> On a more personal note, honey...<eos> I have to stop now.<eos> All right.<eos> Holy shit. I think we can actually make it.<eos> All right.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Shit. We must've left the work lights on all night.<eos> Well, do we have jumper cables?<eos> - Jared did.
I know how close you and Eliza were.<eos> No, you don't, Garcia.<eos> But you will.<eos> Sorry? I promised her I'd protect her.<eos> From you.<eos> Now I'm promising you, one way or the other, you're gonna pay for this.<eos> D.C. sent me down to eliminate Ciudad Natal embeds from New Orleans, and that's what I've done.<eos> Time for me to go home.<eos> But the face of the Natal, Javier Garcia, is still walking around like he owns the place. Yeah.<eos> But he doesn't.
What about him?<eos> Don't be coy with me.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> 'Cause I know you know.<eos> I figured the FBI would lock him up, why WITSEC?<eos> Curious how you heard.<eos> It-It makes no difference how I heard, I just did.<eos> I'm just trying to figure out what the hell's going on, and why this scum rates protection.<eos> Must have something valuable to offer.<eos> Well, obviously he does.
Jesus, when are you going to understand this?<eos> You were never in love with me.<eos> You were in love with who you were when you were with me.<eos> Huh...<eos> I gotta unpack that.<eos> Yo, mind your own business.<eos> Hard to do since you can hear everything through the wall.<eos> Everything.<eos> Well, I hope you enjoyed the show.<eos> Oh, I did.
That's what I'm telling myself in this moment.<eos> So, yeah, let's just go with it.<eos> - Gotcha.<eos> - Okay, yeah, sounds good, man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is on me, guys.<eos> I thought...<eos> I really believed her.<eos> I always believe her.<eos> We all do.
Why do you need bows and arrows in the future?<eos> Like, I don't understand it.<eos> No, I like those Hunger Game movies starring that girl.<eos> They're exciting but you always know they're gonna turn out okay.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Nobody listen to him.<eos> Well, you know, I just think that YA is the most interesting thing happening in fiction today.<eos> - What?<eos> - Hear, hear.<eos> - I do.
It's not our plan!<eos> Our plan?<eos> It's not...<eos> It's not our plan!<eos> Don't call it our plan.<eos> It is our plan.<eos> Does anybody wanna come and see me perform in my Whitesnake cover band this weekend?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - We're pretty good.<eos> - I do.
He's right here, man.<eos> You want to talk to him, man?<eos> No, I don't want to do that.<eos> I don't want him to even know that this is me.<eos> Can you take a few steps away from him?<eos> Alright.<eos> You look so hot in those goggles, bro.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that I am gonna tell Ethan what happened.<eos> Unless you already have.<eos> No. I did not.
I don't want to celebrate getting old!<eos> Come on, it's gonna be terrific!<eos> It's too complicated.<eos> Why can't we just go out to dinner?<eos> You do that all the time.<eos> You're turning 40! We're having a party.<eos> - That's what you do when you turn 40.<eos> - Well, I don't want to.<eos> I wish you'd told me that six months ago.<eos> I did.
It's just... in there.<eos> Hand towel's on the bottom.<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> Can I have a minute to talk to my wife?<eos> I haven't seen her in a week.<eos> - What's your plan?<eos> - My plan is to tell her about us. Before she brings it up first, okay?<eos> Did you see how she just greeted me?<eos> - She definitely knows.<eos> - She does not.
- Have fun. - Thanks.<eos> We will keep it down.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why did I bow?<eos> It's a sign of respect.<eos> I'm sure he appreciated it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Another round of your most expensive liquor.<eos> - And who wants caviar?<eos> - I do.
Shall we?<eos> I don't know about you, but I could use a drink.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Never better.<eos> Sebastian?<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah. Pulse is normal, I'm breathing regular.<eos> There's not a thing wrong with me.<eos> Why do you look like someone just died?<eos> Because Tammy almost did.
Your hands...<eos> We had taken the medicine.<eos> There was a campfire.<eos> When I woke up, you and Silas and Steve told me the story. But I didn't see any of it. "The story"?<eos> Tell them that you acted out of spite, that you'll support their leadership.<eos> It's over.<eos> I want you home with me.<eos> I...<eos> I, want to apologize and, to be clear... she knows how badly she's fucked up.<eos> Bill She does.
I don't remember many others.<eos> Really?<eos> Hmm, my hands are all greasy.<eos> With every good thing, no matter how small it is, it's always... married to something so completely disgusting.<eos> You can't escape it.<eos> You're right. It's gross.<eos> We are animals.<eos> Why does that feel so good?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It always did.
We all know that Tina can't keep her mouth shut.<eos> I don't even know who Tina is.<eos> Yeah, but Abby and Tina ain't friends.<eos> Yeah, but Tina will tell Bill, the pharmacist, who, by the way, likes to wear women's underwear.<eos> What?<eos> Found that out from Tina.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So?<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> I didn't.
Okay, fine.<eos> "Fuck, Colt loves Abby."<eos> Yeah, I didn't have enough paint to cover up the "Fuck," so I just added to it.<eos> This whole situation sucks.<eos> And it also sucks that we live in a town where everyone's gotta know our business.<eos> Now at least they'll know this, too.<eos> It's so sweet, Colt.<eos> And you even put the comma in the right spot.<eos> Honestly, that was just a lucky guess.<eos> I didn't... I just...
Yeah.<eos> Oh, yeah, I've been meanin' to get to those.<eos> Hey, did you fuck Tracy Jenkins back in high school?<eos> Rooster, I'm really gonna need those reports.<eos> And yes... yes, I did.<eos> Man, that is fuckin' awesome.<eos> Damn it, Dale, you know?<eos> And speaking of Dale, you're not gonna be able to hire him, 'cause he's not on our approved list of vets.<eos> - What? No one told me that.<eos> - I did.
Okay.<eos> Want me to take it up for you?<eos> Heather?<eos> I can't.<eos> What?<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I thought it's what I wanted, but... now that I'm here and it's all happenin'...<eos> Okay.<eos> You wanna leave?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Yeah!<eos> I hardly felt it.<eos> Shut up.<eos> A break... I... I gotta put these cucumbers out.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right, I'm done.<eos> What do you wanna do?<eos> Well... does the break room have a lock on the door?<eos> It does.
Where will I find the man Uhtred?<eos> Lord Uhtred will be that way, with the king's guard, and the king, and half the townsfolk starved of interest.<eos> Clapa's a bear.<eos> A big, angry bear.<eos> Should we call a halt?<eos> Not at all.<eos> With a little luck, a blow will land.<eos> All he's doing is showing off his feathers.<eos> I believe the lady feels the same.<eos> They usually do.
Then that is what we do.<eos> Lord, this is not a plan that can be decided upon quickly.<eos> There are other ways!<eos> Uhtred, as the king explained earlier, you do not have a voice...<eos> I will say what's on my mind and clearly!<eos> This plan can never work... there are other ways to defeat Kjartan.<eos> It seems everyone is wrong but you, Uhtred Ragnarson.<eos> Do we have a plan, King Guthred?<eos> Yes, we have a plan... and we have an agreement, do we not?<eos> We do.
Good thinking.<eos> - So, on my count.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Three, two...<eos> - Not again.<eos> Well done, Your Highness.<eos> My head feels like it was stomped on by The Colossus of Rhodes.<eos> Yeah, well, Valerian sleeping drugs will do that to you.<eos> You know, it would've been nice if you'd mentioned that your sifu had joined forces with Lam.<eos> He didn't.
My money's on the underground markets of Chengguan.<eos> There you can buy anything or anyone.<eos> All aboard?<eos> You are not leaving this dimension.<eos> I have no choice.<eos> All right, to be continued.<eos> For right now, what about Shangri-La?<eos> Lam's about to take it over and we're not gonna let that happen.<eos> Lam can take it over, but only if he has the staff.<eos> He does.
That whole towns have been hit by mass hysteria.<eos> Innocent people have lost their lives.<eos> All with these Librarians that happen to be in the center of it all.<eos> Yes, they protect the people.<eos> - From these artifacts?<eos> - It's why the Library exists.<eos> So magical items stay in the hands of the people who comprehend them.<eos> You mean a failed academic, a cowboy, a janitor, and a crook?<eos> Clearly you don't understand these people or what they do.<eos> - But do you?
Rescuing you.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I am now.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> We're running out of daylight.<eos> Two of them, three of us.<eos> Easy peasy, lemon squeasy.<eos> "Never fear moving forward slowly; fear only to stand still."<eos> Who said that? Oh!<eos> He did.
What's the Murder Harp?<eos> Something Lam just recently acquired for his collection.<eos> Constructed from the bones from a murdered girl and strung with her hair.<eos> It corrupts the soul of all who listen to it.<eos> Tops Jenkins' "Most-Wanted" list.<eos> Stone, give him the "pfft"!<eos> You guys get the staff from Lam.<eos> I got this.<eos> Sifu, please, you don't want to do this.<eos> All right, maybe you do.
So what is the plan, if you don't mind me asking?<eos> This.<eos> A gravity tractor.<eos> Oh, that would deflect the asteroid using gravitational pull.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We position a probe next to the asteroid.<eos> Even though its mass is small, the probe generates its own gravitational field.<eos> Diverting the asteroid's path just enough to miss Earth.<eos> But you need a rocket powerful enough to get it there in time, and that rocket doesn't exist yet.<eos> Well, actually, it does.
Do you never imagine things are different than they are?<eos> I do not.<eos> Oh, Marilla, how much you miss.<eos> Well, speaking of names, we'd like you to sign this and take ours.<eos> If the idea appeals to you.<eos> I've got the pen. It's all ready for you.<eos> This is your family Bible.<eos> You want me to be a Cuthbert?<eos> A real Cuthbert?<eos> We do.
So we Blood Eagle Ecbert and then we move on.<eos> We raid this entire land, so that they never have a chance to assemble another army again.<eos> Why would we even want to stay here?<eos> It is what our father wanted.<eos> He didn't just want to win battles.<eos> He wanted land here.<eos> He wanted to make settlements so our people could live and they could work.<eos> Mmm. And we all know what happened.<eos> Yes, but in those days he did not hold a king to ransom, nor did he have a great army.<eos> We do.
Even Aunt Josephine said she'd be glad to see you again, and she doesn't like anyone.<eos> Wasn't she only staying while your parents were away?<eos> No, no, she's come to stay with us for at least a month.<eos> I don't quite know how we'll stand it.<eos> She's so very particular.<eos> But she's suffered a loss - she's grieving - so she's disinclined to be home alone in Charlottetown<eos> - since her companion passed away. - Her companion?<eos> Her best friend forever and ever.<eos> Aunt Josephine never married.<eos> Neither of them did.
Being a good cook shouldn't be very high on the list of romantic attributes, if you ask me.<eos> If one was interested in romance, which I'm not, I'd like to be noticed for me, not my dinner.<eos> - You're so funny, Anne.<eos> - I wasn't meaning to be funny.<eos> So what's on the list?<eos> My brain, Diana. My personality.<eos> As in, who I am.<eos> I'd like to believe that's what truly matters.<eos> If romance matters at all.<eos> Which it doesn't.
Wow, Quagmire, thanks for saving all of our lives.<eos> We're sorry for saying your job was easy.<eos> Yeah, you're the best damn pilot in the world.<eos> He's right.<eos> What you did up there was amazing.<eos> Thanks, guys, that means a lot.<eos> Boy, that was quite a trip, wasn't it?<eos> Sure was.<eos> And we learned a lot about blue jeans, - didn't we, guys?<eos> - Yes, yes, we did, yeah.
History lesson. The Jedi won the war with Mandalore.<eos> These tricks will amount to something, maybe save you from time to time, but they won't keep you alive in the long run.<eos> Only training... and discipline will do that.<eos> The only thing I'm learning is that Ezra must be really gifted to learn as well as he has from a lousy teacher like you.<eos> Not now, Ezra.<eos> Look...<eos> I just wanted to say I know what it's like.<eos> Believe me,<eos> Kanan's not the easiest teacher to have, but he means well.<eos> Does he?
NASA has a lot of leadership potential and a lot of budget potential.<eos> And it can use it to partner with these companies.<eos> Rather than fight against these companies and make its own rocket, let the private companies fight for who has the best rocket, and then NASA will use that best rocket to do its business in space and in Mars.<eos> Welcome to the live webcast of the SpaceX launch of the ORBCOM mission from Launch Complex 40 out of Cape Canaveral, Florida.<eos> Elon Musk of SpaceX, he asked, "What is it we need to do to go to Mars?"<eos> And people told him, these are experts told him,<eos> "We need to lower the cost of getting into low Earth orbit."<eos> Elon thinks of Earth as a hard drive, and he thinks of humanity as a very important file on that hard drive, and Elon looks at the history of mass extinction events and sees the hard drive has a tendency to crash.<eos> Some people think it's fine, just stay on Earth forever.<eos> And some people don't.
We know that that $50,000 bonus would have gone a long way to saving your ass.<eos> So you think I killed Mitch for that bonus money.<eos> Well, you're a sharp guy.<eos> Yeah, that's... that's a great theory and all, but here's the thing...<eos> So... sorry you had to waste your time.<eos> But since you have me here, what kind of car are you driving?<eos> Because we have some incredible lease programs right now.<eos> Okay, the only thing I want to hear out of you right now is your alibi for last night, assuming you have one.<eos> You got one of those?<eos> I do.
And what if she just walks out and slaughters everyone just for a laugh?<eos> Well, I will be monitoring you the whole time.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yes, you and Nardole.<eos> You can be her companions.<eos> Oh, nah!<eos> Forget it.<eos> Absolutely no way.<eos> Nardole agreed.<eos> No, I didn't.
Why do you want to do this?<eos> She's my friend.<eos> She's my oldest friend in the universe.<eos> You've got lots of friends.<eos> Better ones.<eos> What's so special about her?<eos> - She's different.<eos> - Different how?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Kill...<eos> Sorry, sorry.<eos> This way, Mr Razor, look sharp!<eos> Would you like some tea?<eos> This way, this way.<eos> What about him?<eos> - It's all right.<eos> They don't feel pain.<eos> - I think they do.<eos> Yes, they do.
But those numbers have stopped cold, and the only way to bring them up is for you to go out there and sing the most romantic song of all time.<eos> "Nessun dorma."<eos> "Nessun dorma," Puccini's most powerful, beautiful aria about love.<eos> But it's too dangerous. Every time someone performs it on TV or in the movies, someone's assassinated.<eos> You know, like Mission:<eos> Impossible, Rogue Nation,<eos> -The Sum of all Fears.<eos> -Those are just movies!<eos> This is real life.<eos> So, do it!
Then hand it over.<eos> And the spell to get Hook back.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> All right.<eos> We have a deal.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Since I'm sure we have work to do, let's get my pirate back.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> Actually, yes, I did.
One. - One, two. - Councilman, you have visitors.<eos> I'm Councilman Hill.<eos> You must be with NCIS.<eos> I was told you'd be joining the investigation.<eos> Detective Deeks, LAPD, this is Special Agent Jones.<eos> Hi. So, uh, you get right back after it, huh?<eos> No days off.<eos> Can't afford to. Every moment these kids are in here, they're not on the streets.<eos> It's a game of moments, you know?<eos> I do, actually.
But you didn't tell her it was not okay to park in my spot.<eos> I did not.<eos> Hey. We have a new lead on the shooting.<eos> Anna's waiting up in Ops.<eos> Actually, it's just Callen.<eos> Sam, Hetty has something else for you.<eos> Where is Hetty?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, all she said this morning was that she had one last card to play.<eos> She always does.
We need to find out who placed it.<eos> I looked into the envelope the log came in.<eos> Made by Minoso Paper Company... available in any office-supply store on the East Coast.<eos> - No fingerprints, no DNA.<eos> - So a total bust.<eos> Whoever left that info for you in the elevator didn't want it traced back to them.<eos> Well, luckily, they gave us enough to figure out where the anonymous tip was placed from.<eos> City directory says it's a pay phone in the Financial District.<eos> - They still have those?<eos> - In 2011, they did.
Six months?<eos> Right, and you think I'm gonna train her?<eos> Well, yes, it would be easier if you did.<eos> But still, I think we can cobble together a training regimen that'll get the job done.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> What did you think would happen?<eos> That you'd get on your proud, little soapbox, make your speech, and they'd just, what, slink away into the darkness?<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> You asked me to pick a side.<eos> Well, I did.
I'll save you a seat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Gibbs.<eos> - Gibbs.<eos> - Hey, Chief.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Well...<eos> I'm exhausted and I'm sore.<eos> I thought we agreed never to speak of that.<eos> Yeah, we did.
It's just family stuff.<eos> Gibbs?<eos> MTAC.<eos> You've never been to New Orleans?<eos> We got to get you down here.<eos> Well, I'd rather it be for fun than, work.<eos> It's always fun.<eos> Especially since Mardi Gras is coming up.<eos> Hey, tell Gibbs you need a little vacation.<eos> We all do, Christopher.
We need to talk.<eos> Chen.<eos> I found a translator for the last message intercepted from Chen's people.<eos> What's it say?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Looks like it's just a bunch of song lyrics.<eos> Must be another code.<eos> Maybe operational info on Chen's next attack.<eos> When's Interpol gonna make a move on the yacht he's staying on?<eos> They did.
I am not the enemy.<eos> Well, that is news to me.<eos> Then apparently you have not heard.<eos> Heard what?<eos> We are on the same team now.<eos> When were you gonna tell me? !<eos> Tell you what?<eos> Chen.<eos> How long have you known that Chen was working with the CIA?<eos> He didn't.
Jenna, what the hell was that?<eos> You have to remember, we're not politicians here.<eos> We don't dance with the devil.<eos> We put devils away or we put 'em down.<eos> You think I dance with the devil?<eos> What?<eos> You think you don't?<eos> You can let the Kai Chens of the world operate as long as it serves your greater good; we cannot.<eos> Our greater good helps a lot of people.<eos> Of course it does and so do you, but just not the way we do.
And what about Collins?<eos> Nothing inappropriate was going on.<eos> Baxter wasn't the only person onboard who said that you two spent a lot of time together.<eos> I mean, that's because we did.<eos> Collins had tremendous potential.<eos> I knew he was officer material.<eos> I was helping him apply for a commission.<eos> We sent off his application to Officer Candidate School a few weeks before he went missing.<eos> In that time together, did he ever mention having any issues with anyone?<eos> Only with Baxter, but... so did everyone.
Pleasure.<eos> Collins deserved justice.<eos> I only wish I could have done more for him.<eos> You did. What do you mean?<eos> The Secretary of the Navy reviewed Collins' OCS application.<eos> She saw the same potential you did.<eos> He's been posthumously commissioned rank of ensign.<eos> I knew Collins would make a damn good naval officer.<eos> He had a good role model.<eos> Yes, he did.
He stayed apart from the group all morning, so the corporal had to do the same.<eos> All right.<eos> Understood.<eos> Thank you. Ooh.<eos> Okay, I got you.<eos> All right, thank you, guys, very much.<eos> Thanks, guys. Bishop, Bishop, did you see that, with the notepad? Hmm?<eos> He was being nice.<eos> No, he brushed his hand against her when he handed it back.<eos> He did not.
You saying the boys are up and running again?<eos> And you think I'm running it from in here.<eos> Well, that's been done before.<eos> To be honest, by the time I got locked up, I didn't have many friends left.<eos> A bunch of 'em got killed.<eos> Yeah, mostly by you.<eos> Those sick rumors still floating around?<eos> You can think what you want, but I'm telling you the truth, straight up.<eos> I didn't kill my homies.<eos> Sure you did, straight up.
Remember the mysterious substance we found under the fingernails of Corporal Campbell?<eos> Yeah, Abby's compared every mud in North America.<eos> Nothing matched.<eos> Yeah, except for the remarkably similar substance we found on Alonzo Marcel's boots.<eos> If they are one in the same, then that would directly connect the two attacks.<eos> It's a whole lot of ifs, Ducky.<eos> Why you hit the-the emergency button?<eos> Because I can.<eos> We don't have an emergency, Gibbs.<eos> Or do we?
Caterer's calling.<eos> Talk later.<eos> Well, I guess that's that.<eos> Hey, decision made.<eos> No.<eos> What's with the long face?<eos> Delilah. She hated it.<eos> She hated the tux.<eos> What? No, no, no.<eos> No, she didn't.
He's from Overbrook, Pennsylvania.<eos> Worked on board as a culinary specialist.<eos> His parents were on vacation in New Zealand.<eos> They're catching the next flight back to D.C.<eos> Jones got a sister, Regina, freshman at John Hamilton.<eos> She's also been notified of her brother's death.<eos> And it didn't take a criminal mastermind to break in.<eos> The padlock on the freezer's just flimsy.<eos> How do you steal a body on board of a ship full of people and nobody saw anything?<eos> Maybe someone did.
And there she is, our beautiful, blushing bride.<eos> Please, everyone, help me welcome the future Delilah Fielding McGee.<eos> Nick, you are not emceeing our wedding reception.<eos> All I'm saying is I can get the party started.<eos> So, what are you doing here?<eos> I am dropping off our revised guest list.<eos> You're in charge of invitations and these need to go out this week.<eos> Wait, 308 guests?<eos> I thought we agreed on a small wedding.<eos> We did.
Jasper heard it first.<eos> That's the only reason I stopped to listen.<eos> We trust each other's instincts.<eos> Does that include finding dead bodies?<eos> For everything.<eos> Trust makes mounted police work possible.<eos> They're flight animals.<eos> They run when they're scared.<eos> How does that work in the big city?<eos> Well, it doesn't.
Yeah, with monkey skulls?<eos> No.<eos> Our conversations were short.<eos> He's been playing hard to get.<eos> Is it possible maybe he was trying to sell them, the skulls?<eos> No way.<eos> Tanner may not have committed to my organization, but he was committed to these animals.<eos> I thought you said this was about revenge.<eos> Well, I... possibly, if we knew who might have a reason.<eos> Oh, I-I do.
Four targets?<eos> We need to split up for time's sake.<eos> Alex and I will take the library and the Reserve.<eos> You three take the bank and the Exchange.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Keep your comms open.<eos> The list of charges against the Citizen's Liberation Front, which includes both of you, is... why don't we start with arson, assault, conspiracy to defraud the government, possession of a biological weapon, extortion, homicide in the first and second degree.<eos> Right, and treason.<eos> I was told these people wanted to do good.<eos> They did.
You risk everything for your country, and I hope I can live up to your example.<eos> Is Harry gone?<eos> I don't know, and I don't care.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Thought you left already.<eos> No. No.<eos> First I needed to sober up... remember what I'd done and pack my meager belongings.<eos> What you said last night...<eos> You were right. I didn't get what I wanted.<eos> But nobody does.
Just think about it, my dear, but not for too long.<eos> Looks fine.<eos> Ah, I should iron it just a little.<eos> - Come on, Jules. It's the guys. - They don't care.<eos> It's the guys and their wives, and wives care about those kind of things.<eos> Come on.<eos> I think you're just trying to get me out of my clothes.<eos> I mean, we are in a hotel room alone.<eos> We do not have to hear this story again. - Yes, yes, we do.<eos> - Yes, we do.
We both know you killed Boyle.<eos> I didn't.
Okay, so what is it?<eos> What could you possibly have?<eos> I'm not discussing this with you.<eos> Because you have nothing.<eos> The case is reopened, Agent Blye.<eos> And my guess is is that you have an awful lot at stake in clearing Deeks' name once and for all.<eos> Somebody is trying to create a problem where there isn't one.<eos> Who is the source of this new evidence you have?<eos> You know what? It occurs to me now you probably know what happened all those years ago.<eos> Maybe more than you did last year.
Is that a cow?<eos> Mm-hmm, his name is Kaltenecker.<eos> So, did you find a way to bond with your lion?<eos> Yes, and we need to get moving.<eos> We're headed for the Blade of Marmora's headquarters.<eos> I'll plot a course.<eos> While you're doing that, I'm gonna hook up the video game Lance and I bought.<eos> Yeah! Let's get this baby set up.<eos> Where can we...<eos> How do...
"My friend's having an abortion.<eos> I had to come right in.<eos> And it's a guy so it's a weird procedure, so just please leave me alone.<eos> I don't wanna..."<eos> So, I just tell him I'm a comedian and then he goes:<eos> "Madam, this is not a provocation... but your life does not seem interesting enough that you have to go around the world and tell it."<eos> And he's right, isn't he?<eos> And that was how the tour ended is he said "not a provocation"<eos> and then gave me a big old provocation.<eos> And then he did one nice thing.
Listen to your daddy."<eos> He's on his death bed, his father is like, "Son, any more wisdom before you go?"<eos> And he's just like, "Black boots," and then he dies.<eos> No one knows what he means. His wife never understood.<eos> "Black boots?<eos> I know what that means.<eos> His daddy was in the war.<eos> His daddy wore black boots.<eos> He wants to wear his daddy's boots in his coffin."<eos> And he doesn't.
They know about each other, right?<eos> That they won't be alone in their accusations?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> But this situation goes far beyond the usual problems of embarrassment or misplaced sense of culpability.<eos> I have no doubt that their lives and the lives of their families have been threatened.<eos> So I guess... this idea's played out.<eos> Well, ma'am, if I may suggest one other option.<eos> And I do so knowing just how far over the line I might be stepping.<eos> You think that I should come forward about what happened to me.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I do.
Who stabbed her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you see who did it?<eos> There was someone else in the room, but...<eos> Man or woman?<eos> I don't know because I was drugged.<eos> It was all hazy.<eos> How'd you get blood on your hands?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Radio's tuned to 98.2 Wuko.<eos> That's our boy.<eos> Please, just think about it.<eos> Think about the evidence.<eos> I know.<eos> Scratch dots his Is and crosses his Ts.<eos> We know that. But a jury won't.<eos> A jury will only see what Scratch wants them to see.<eos> You think they'll convict me? I don't know.<eos> But if they do, 5 years...
Kathy was definitely here.<eos> Matches the pair that she stole from the woman at the plaza.<eos> Let me guess... Han Boshane.<eos> Agent Garrett, do you mind telling me how you knew for us to come here?<eos> We found the man in the States who's forcing Kathy to do this.<eos> Well, if Jane and Kathy were both being coerced, then why did Jane end up dead?<eos> Maybe she got cold feet.<eos> I mean, I can't even imagine having to choose between my best friend's life and my brother's.<eos> But even so, why kill Han?<eos> Maybe she didn't.
You got, like, 200 of these dumps.<eos> And an Etsy shop, where I put googly eyes on trash.<eos> But I visit my stores all the time.<eos> I'm very hands-on.<eos> Gene, how's the girlfriend? Just don't let the wife find out about her, am I right?<eos> [Artie chuckles] He's a terrible person.<eos> So what brings you two here, besides the obvious shoplifting?<eos> That's profiling.<eos> Just 'cause my clothes aren't as nice as some of these other people doesn't mean I'm a thief.<eos> That does.
Well, technically, the store has been asked.<eos> Mm, sounds like sour grapes.<eos> Not sour grapes.<eos> I'm just trying to be accurate.<eos> You know, the last museum I went to was incredible.<eos> I mean, the Tom Cruise was so lifelike, you could almost bend over and pat his head.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna submit a spearhead that I found while hiking in a rainforest in Brazil.<eos> It was Honduras.<eos> I think I know my rainforests.<eos> Do you?
Why are we talking about this for?<eos> You were telling Chuck he has nothing to worry about.<eos> Oh!<eos> Right, right.<eos> In fact, to this day, he only serves salad with two big spoons. Oh, boy.<eos> Here comes Santa Claus.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, w-who's been drinking my prep?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
This is about who's to blame.<eos> Walt, we did everything by the book.<eos> I know you did, Jack, but we got a body count.<eos> So book or no book, somebody screwed the pooch.<eos> I just don't want that somebody to be you.<eos> You're not done with me yet.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> But you and Barnes needed a time-out, so... excuse me.<eos> Agent Seger, three years ago, you took a leave of absence.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Dialysis?<eos> - What's wrong with your kidneys?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Stop fussing. Go.<eos> Should I be concerned?<eos> You may be dying, but I am here to make sure it's not fatal.<eos> Do you remember who I am?<eos> John.<eos> Of course I remember.<eos> But no one else does.
No, you don't know what you're getting into.<eos> I'm getting into a dress. And then, I'm gonna get down to the truth.<eos> - Oh, well, she's gone rogue then.<eos> - Yeah, that's right.<eos> If anybody should know if Len Sipp is a hypocrite, it's me.<eos> No, no, we don't need to know if he's a hypocrite.<eos> We need to know why Dyad is buying up cosmetic companies.<eos> Great, then pay attention because I have a surveillance kit and an earpiece.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
There are a few freshmen I could reach out to.<eos> They might help keep the CBC together.<eos> You wanna be minority whip.<eos> Only if I deserve to be.<eos> I'm trying to get back.<eos> Congressman Lewis is 20 minutes late as usual.<eos> Is there a spot for him on financial services?<eos> Doug, stay where you are.<eos> I thought you said you were telling the CIA to stand down.<eos> I did.
We're fixing it.<eos> Yeah... that's what they're afraid of.<eos> The statement's about the FBI.<eos> Everybody trusts the FBI.<eos> Hey, who's Lisa Williams?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, somebody from the Herald called.<eos> They were just wondering if you knew her.<eos> I don't.
That's not how I see America.<eos> I'm a patriot.<eos> I serve.<eos> Well, then, we salute you, General.<eos> But you serve to what purpose?<eos> So the rest of America can sell.<eos> I mean, you and I, right now, this weekend, we're here at this camp selling ourselves.<eos> Character speaks for itself.<eos> People want a president they can trust.<eos> No, they don't.
Hey, it's Seth Grayson.<eos> Yeah, I got something for you.<eos> Kate Baldwin's people were ready to go, but the FSB replaced the crew.<eos> You have something on your tooth.<eos> Do we know where they were going?<eos> No, but they're still being tracked.<eos> Kate Baldwin was never supposed to talk to him.<eos> -This interview cannot happen.<eos> -We still have time.<eos> No, we don't.
Mark, I think you need to be elsewhere right now.<eos> Are we gonna bury our heads in the sand with this?<eos> No, you're going to leave, and the vice president and I are going to decide what to do.<eos> Walker reneged.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We will let you know if you are needed.<eos> - Sir... - That was not a request.<eos> Why did you have to go talk to him?<eos> There has to be a way out, Francis.<eos> Does there?
The president had no idea.<eos> You were close to Mr. Macallan?<eos> Yes, but that doesn't mean that I knew what he was up to.<eos> But then how do you know the president wasn't involved?<eos> I was the last person to see Aidan.<eos> He confessed to me.<eos> He secretly used the NSA, FISA, to manipulate the electorate.<eos> We're meeting with counsel to perfect the rest of the testimony.<eos> As long as no one has anything that contradicts you.<eos> No one does.
Oh, its worth is what we're here to discuss.<eos> I don't appreciate being the one to tell you this, but... your presidency is beyond repair.<eos> You don't know what I'm going to do next.<eos> Isn't that it? Isn't that what really bothers you?<eos> Don't think I haven't been watching you from the moment you stepped on board.<eos> You're full of promises, Ms. Davis.<eos> The information about Macallan is still out there and Ahmadi is, oh, so elusive.<eos> You've been sabotaging me from the moment you stepped into my house.<eos> You don't care for me very much, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
No. Not cute ducks.<eos> -Wolves!<eos> This whole place is a wolves' nest.<eos> And if Jesus was here, he'd be all, "I should've stuck with carpentry!"<eos> -Amen!<eos> -Tell the truth!<eos> Preach it!<eos> So... maybe there's no such thing as real religion because it's all just people, and people are bad.<eos> Like Miss Clara, who stole that brooch from the clothing drive.<eos> [congregation gasps] She didn't, baby girl.
Hey, Leonard, if you're happy and you know it, no need to clap your hands, because I have an emotion detector.<eos> How's it working out? Surprisingly well.<eos> That's great, I'm happy for you.<eos> No, wait, uh, hold on.<eos> Oh, what, you are. Aren't you sweet?<eos> What's that? Are you working on your resume?<eos> No, it's my brother's.<eos> I'm trying to help him get a job out here.<eos> Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry.<eos> No, it doesn't.
He's using us, Kyle.<eos> The other day, he was using you to make me jealous, and now, he's using me to make you jealous.<eos> Mr. B. would never do anything like that.<eos> That's exactly what I'm doing, Kyle.<eos> You know what?<eos> He's not gonna go for it, Mike.<eos> Hey, if Mr. B. thinks I'm gonna fall for it, I am not gonna let him down.<eos> All right.<eos> Who wants to learn a little bit about tools?<eos> Oh, I do. A lot more than Ryan.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.<eos> It is a good look on me. (GRUNTS)<eos> Combine your attacks!<eos> Songbird, turn up the music!<eos> (EXCLAIMS) You gotta be kidding me!<eos> More lousy bots?<eos> Stay together, and target them one at a time.<eos> (LAUGHS) Just like bowling.<eos> Who wants to knock down the pin?<eos> I do! (GRUNTS)
Now I'm gonna ask you a question I don't want you to answer.<eos> Did GlobeSpill do anything illegal?<eos> Has GlobeSpill reported false information?<eos> Really?<eos> Does the false information relate to Tamsin's... leaked memo?<eos> Does the false information relate to the Ranger attack?<eos> Has GlobeSpill reported false information?<eos> Really?<eos> Tamsin didn't betray those Rangers.<eos> GlobeSpill did.
That's why I want to tell you the truth about the memo.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That'll be all.<eos> Your witness.<eos> See, they classified it, so you wouldn't know what really happened.<eos> - Tamsin!<eos> - Lieutenant, stop, you'll only make things worse for yourself.<eos> - You know who got those Rangers killed?<eos> - GlobeSpill.<eos> GlobeSpill did it, not Lieutenant Dale.
No, no, no, no, no, Ryan.<eos> You know, you know, it's funny, it's funny, Ryan, Ryan.<eos> Not ha-ha funny, when I think about my wife and my young daughter, who wouldn't think that this is very funny at all, but if I had to do this all over again... you would definitely be out here on your own.<eos> No, I'd be dead by now.<eos> You're nuts.<eos> You have a wife and kid?<eos> Yes, and I love them very much, Ryan.<eos> Then let me go.<eos> You got too much to live for, man.<eos> I don't. No.
Does this mean I have a job?<eos> I'm glad it worked out for you, I am.<eos> But I've been bouncing around between entry-level jobs for years now, only to get laid off yesterday.<eos> Yeah? From what job?<eos> Associate Systems Engineer.<eos> It's a fancy way of saying "apprentice architect."<eos> Yeah, "Assistant Medical Examiner." It doesn't sound very fancy either.<eos> Is that what you are?<eos> Yeah, but I love it.<eos> I do.
That's a very good friend.<eos> Yeah, yeah, she really is.<eos> I don't have friends like that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Ryan!<eos> Hang on!<eos> I got you!<eos> You don't want to die. What?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> No, you don't.
TRAVOLTA (OVER SPEAKERS): This is your captain speaking.<eos> We have reached our cruising altitude.<eos> It is now safe to take off your wigs and be gay.<eos> Well, what's all this?<eos> Oh, just some stuff I got out of my storage unit.<eos> Check this out.<eos> You'll love this.<eos> Do I look like a Terminator dog?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
You fell in love with the Savior? Aye.<eos> Check my inside pocket.<eos> That ring...<eos> It's for her.<eos> You need to get this to her.<eos> The Black Fairy is in Storybrooke.<eos> This is the only hope the Savior has of defeating her.<eos> I wish it were that simple.<eos> There seems to be a curse keeping me from finding my way back home, unless you have some magic that can lift it.<eos> I don't.
No. No!<eos> Emma.<eos> - Emma.<eos> - Dad.<eos> You woke us up.<eos> How?<eos> It was easy.<eos> We just all shared a tiny bit of your curse.<eos> I take it Emma hasn't told you my secret.<eos> Oh, she did.
Well, you-you would have to ask Louis.<eos> I... That is not my place to say.<eos> Now, come on, Eddie.<eos> Let's go.<eos> See ya.<eos> I'm gonna have to use the men's room - before we get on the train. - Okay.<eos> Dr. Cooper to Radiology. Dr. Cooper to Radiology.<eos> You're still here.<eos> I thought Louis gave you the location of the Double Eagle.<eos> He did.
That was the best?"<eos> So, Dad, you'd get drunk, hit your kids, and think,<eos> "'Now, this is me at my best.'"<eos> My father was also a narcissist.<eos> So, the entire mood of the house was dictated by him, and all the attention went his way.<eos> I think me and my brothers and sisters realized early on the best way to deal with him was to minimize our feelings as much as possible so as not to call attention to ourselves.<eos> But you do that long enough, and your feelings start to atrophy to the point that you're incapable of having them.<eos> Two things I knew I could feel were ego and adrenaline, so I basically just set out to achieve a bunch of shit to give myself a surge of good feelings.<eos> Like, I got into NYU film school, which was a miracle at that time.<eos> I did so bad on my SATs.
What is it you need to know?<eos> I've hidden the knives.<eos> Hello, Mother.<eos> You're looking well.<eos> The prodigal daughter returns.<eos> Remarkable recovery you've made for a woman your age.<eos> Women my age either recover or die.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If it helps.<eos> It doesn't.
Okay, you know something, I'm gonna go.<eos> I'm gonna go check on Danny.<eos> Seems like a good idea.<eos> Your concern for him must be affecting your concentration and balance.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Officer Kalakaua, can I ask you a question?<eos> Do you believe that there's a thin line between love and hate?<eos> Because the way that you were laying into me back there, that was so over the top,<eos> I was like, Wow, maybe she likes me.<eos> I don't.
Absolutely.<eos> Have fun.<eos> I love you.<eos> He wants to go watch a basketball game with his buddies.<eos> - What about your romantic...<eos> - It's fine.<eos> How can that be fine?<eos> He's blowing you off.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
Look, the lead in the car battery can protect me from the uranium, like the bib you get in the dentist's office before he does an X-ray, you understand?<eos> - Except there's no reason for both of you to risk exposure.<eos> Removing the canister isn't a two-man job.<eos> Want me to do it?<eos> I'll do it. No.<eos> I'll do it. This thing goes off, we're both screwed anyway.<eos> Besides, you know I'm a control freak.<eos> I'm not gonna argue with you.<eos> You want to do it, you do it.<eos> Do me a favor.
Happy Quinn.<eos> And you're Ada Pearce.<eos> I'm sorry, what are you doing in here?<eos> I'm Sprocketace77.<eos> My God, Dad, she and I built my engine together.<eos> Your Internet must have gone kaput during the storm.<eos> That's why you cut out.<eos> It's nice to meet you, but you have to go.<eos> We have a major problem right now.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Insulation hunk with roofing tile on it.<eos> Careful.<eos> Careful!<eos> Please.<eos> Paige?<eos> David, can I talk to you outside for a second?<eos> I know you're terrified, but they know what they're doing.<eos> No, I'm sure they do.<eos> You just have no idea what it's like to have a child that you worry about every second of every day.<eos> Actually, I do.
Is that clear?<eos> Yes, it's clear.<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> Voice-over: Getting more and more intense.<eos> Got to fall deeper in to beat them.<eos> I've lost friends before, but not like this, Not in a box where I have no control.<eos> Or do I?
I'm not burning. She's the one.<eos> If I keep drinking it, I'll get even better.<eos> Perfect, 7.<eos> My favorite number.<eos> Next number's 14.<eos> So 14. Ok, we can do this.<eos> You haven't asked me how I'm doing.<eos> Every time I talk to these Agents, It's the first thing they want to know.<eos> I guess it's just the natural thing to ask.<eos> But you didn't.

I don't know who you people think I am.<eos> You're Jimmy Capone, born James Vincenzo Capone.<eos> My name's Richard Hart.<eos> You left Brooklyn when you were 16 and changed your name for a fresh start, and wound up becoming a Prohibition Agent.<eos> And you haven't seen your family or your brother ever since you left.<eos> But you know what Al's been up to.<eos> You can't read the morning paper without seeing his name.<eos> Keep it down, will you?<eos> My wife and kids don't know my real name.<eos> Nobody does.
Okay, fine.<eos> Have it your way, but you're doing it without me.<eos> She gonna be okay?<eos> Yeah. She just needs to cool off.<eos> In the meantime, why don't I take that piece of wand back to my vault, see if I can cast a locator spell on it.<eos> What about us?<eos> I mean, we can't just sit around here doing nothing.<eos> Well, we won't be.<eos> We have plenty to do to keep us busy.<eos> We do?
You two know each other? Only by reputation.<eos> Former Navy SEAL, commander of JAG, close friend of Hetty Lange.<eos> I thought you had retired, sir.<eos> So did I, but Henrietta called, said she was in trouble, so here I am, once more in the breach.<eos> Well, we are happy to have you, sir.<eos> Oh.<eos> What is it?<eos> Granger.<eos> There's been a shooting at the hospital. I thought he had 24-hour protection.<eos> He did.
We've got enough to feed a small army here.<eos> In a minute, I'm just finishing this Level up.<eos> We'll be down.<eos> Oscar, come on.<eos> Ah, shit!<eos> Let me do it.<eos> Well, how old is your dad?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, why don't you know?<eos> Just don't.
Do it.<eos> With any luck, somebody will catch it on camera.<eos> You can introduce it at your trial as Exhibit A.<eos> You almost shot a kid, Bill.<eos> He snuck out to go to a party.<eos> You evidently caught him sneaking back in.<eos> Is he gonna be okay?<eos> Mangled his arm good.<eos> - He said you had a gun.<eos> - I did, yeah.
When I go to bed at night, II never know whether to be excited about what's going on in that basement. Or worried.<eos> I lie in bed, and I agonize, Brady.<eos> I agonize.<eos> Now. EEither you care about that. Or you don't.<eos> I would ask that you be somewhat quiet as my mother is upstairs sleeping.<eos> She's not well.<eos> I don't know what I can possibly tell you that I haven't already.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, we were just wondering... and I know we've asked before... but we still wonder whether it's possible that either you left the key in the ignition...<eos> Of course I didn't.
I hope you enjoyed the gift baské.<eos> Well, I'm certainly flattered that you liked my tape.<eos> Your music video was long.<eos> [exhales] Imagine there's music.<eos> ♪ I'm lookin' for a sugar dadday ♪<eos> ♪ Who has a lap for babay ♪ [moans] Oh.<eos> [Buckley] Mom, what are you doing?<eos> You have to remember, that was months ago.<eos> Honestly, Jacqueline, you didn't even get on our gaydar, which is a machine we have here at Bravo...<eos> We do.
Cyndee, stop eating air shrimp.<eos> Now everyone said "shrimp" except me.<eos> -Shrimp!<eos> -All right, how do I do this?<eos> How do I talk about "you know who"<eos> "you know what-ing" me while we were in the "you know where"?<eos> Okay, when you meet Alex Trebek, don't get freaked out that he has legs.<eos> What?<eos> No, I know people have legs.<eos> Lieutenant Dan doesn't.
I thought I'd never get married again after Roland died.<eos> Was shot in the face by you, Lillian!<eos> Well, he died, didn't he?<eos> Do you know what this is?<eos> It's a fox shell.<eos> Fasciolaria trapezium.<eos> [sighs] Russ, this is still inside you.<eos> I know. Because my brothers...<eos> No, I mean, that kid in the attic is a big part of who you are, and I don't want to lose him.<eos> I do.
You!<eos> You!<eos> You think you're safe behind there!<eos> You are not safe from me!<eos> What if Madison Gray relocated to Wisconsin so she could be close to Sears?<eos> All right.<eos> Well, then the question is, why?<eos> Sears was connected... to Alicia's daughter's murder, but did they ever find the actual killer?<eos> No.<eos> No, we did not.
- Excuse me. Sorry.<eos> Excuse me. - What is the nature of terror in America?<eos> What and who should we fear and why?<eos> This attack could not have come at a worse time for President Haas, whose once-sterling national-security credentials have come under attack - from a more confident GOP.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> Everything the Collaborators have done so far has been under the radar, so why a shopping mall?<eos> How does this fit in to their endgame?<eos> Could just be a terrorist attack.<eos> - And we don't know it was them.<eos> - Yes, we do.
It's hard to vote against fear when fear's so fresh.<eos> So, how do we I.D. our targets?<eos> Good question.<eos> Tough one, too.<eos> This is a radioactive issue.<eos> People will hide their votes until the last minute.<eos> So, the key for us is to know these men and women for who they really are, strip away politics, figure out how they play when the chips are down.<eos> And how do we do that?<eos> The FBI and the CIA don't exactly keep oppo research on lawmakers.<eos> No, but I do.
Look, I'm not your soldier, Alex.<eos> I'm not your asset, and I'm not your fiancé.<eos> You think Sasha's trouble?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be careful.<eos> The rest is up to me.<eos> And with this veto, President Haas sends a clear message to the American people.<eos> "You're on your own."<eos> Now, the rich are safe in their mansions and their gated communities, but common, everyday Americans are left to fend for themselves, unsure of when the next jihadist will strike.<eos> And when they do...
You Hi.<eos> I need condoms to have sex.<eos> Uh, but I like to know what I'm purchasing.<eos> Can you answer some questions?<eos> Shoot. Can I try them on before I buy?<eos> No.<eos> How do I put them on?<eos> Check the Internet?<eos> Did you know that originally condoms were made out of leather?<eos> I did not.
Yeah, i know.<eos> But, you know, Don't think that you just get to sit around And do whatever you want all day.<eos> no, i meant, you guys...<eos> You're grounded.<eos> Am i grounded, too?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah. No more special treatment for you, buddy.<eos> Don't worry, ben.<eos> She has no power over us.<eos> Oh, i don't?
Because emergency medicine isn't really what I do. Wait.<eos> What do you do?<eos> I normally deal with dead bodies.<eos> Well, you take much longer, you may have another one on your hands.<eos> No, I think this'll be, uh, the last for awhile.<eos> Are you feeling dizzy?<eos> Any nausea?<eos> Only when I drink tequila.<eos> I'm trying to establish whether or not you have a concussion.<eos> I don't.
So I told them, if that jackass won't pay for his wife, maybe he will pay for his girlfriend.<eos> Oh... Oh, my God.<eos> So I hope, for both of our sakes, that you are lying, and that Tom cares a lot more for you than he does for me.<eos> No. To me, that could be any one of a dozen brands.<eos> Nope.<eos> See over there?<eos> Only Kona has that kind of detail on the label.<eos> Well, clearly, I am in the presence of a craft beer savant. Hey, yo.<eos> We got something?<eos> Oh, we sure do.
But again, dynamite stuff.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Oh. Hi.<eos> Are you Danielle Janikowski?<eos> I am.<eos> And you are?<eos> Bonnie Plunkett.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Well, it appears he has a type.<eos> Oh. Or you and I do.
- Of course I do.<eos> Why else would I risk squeezing through your doggy door with a full bladder?<eos> It is possible that you're just insane.<eos> It is. Keep that in mind.<eos> So, what happened?<eos> He cheat on you?<eos> - No.<eos> - You cheat on him?<eos> - What did he tell you?<eos> - Not as much as you just did.
Here we go.<eos> - And he goes, and he gets the elevation!<eos> - Nice job, Ryan!<eos> Nice job!<eos> USA! USA! USA!<eos> - That was incredible.<eos> Incredible. Wow.<eos> Made that jump with room to spare.<eos> I thought he would have gone for the bonus, but he's playing it safe.<eos> Doing good, Ryan!
Okay, you know, Buddhism clearly isn't for neurotics.<eos> Or maybe just the opposite.<eos> Look who that is!<eos> Come here!<eos> Who is this?<eos> Who is this?<eos> My goodness.<eos> This is my girl.<eos> I tell ya, staffers just keep getting younger and younger,<eos> - don't they?
Jimmy Neutron?<eos> Wesley Crusher?<eos> Clay Jong-Un?<eos> No.<eos> They're bonding.<eos> This is an interesting theory.<eos> Why don't you bring it up?<eos> You guys, we've been at this for hours and still no answers.<eos> Well, Nimah has one.<eos> No, I don't.
Sure.<eos> Just go easy on my firewall, would you?<eos> I got you, Sean.<eos> Owen and Alex got Sean's finger-scan.<eos> As soon as it gets to you, log into their system and download their trade history.<eos> Already on it.<eos> Plan trade data coming in.<eos> Alex, I've put us on closed comms.<eos> I got an answer from Keyes about the recruit Leon mentioned who died in the car crash.<eos> They didn't.
What, you think they'd tell you?<eos> I spoke to Charlotte Bishop.<eos> She said it happened right after The Farm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They threw me out after I exposed their mission here.<eos> Well, now you have your answers, Alex, so I'll...<eos> Harry...<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
You're not going after him.<eos> I am.<eos> He'll lead me to Kate.<eos> Get Dembe to a hospital, please.<eos> We should double back, find another path.<eos> This is all too exposed.<eos> You must know my friend Kate.<eos> Should've told you about Janet.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It does to me.
Let me just say again, I really, really, really think it's a stupid idea.<eos> You need the electrolytes.<eos> Drink up.<eos> No, just... will you just listen to me for a second?<eos> Max said that Cece was in actual trouble, like violence, death.<eos> He's a con artist.<eos> He was lying.<eos> What if he wasn't?<eos> Look, she chose this life, all right?<eos> Patrick didn't.
- Okay.<eos> You know how I can get ahold of her?<eos> No, we have no contact.<eos> Not even a cell phone?<eos> Security?<eos> No one's been keeping tabs on her?<eos> We severed all ties.<eos> Tough love, it's what they told us to do.<eos> Do any of you know a man named Bobby Trent?<eos> No, no, I don't.
Stall them.<eos> You can't do that, Hank.<eos> Stall them.<eos> Your lawyer's downstairs.<eos> Or your dad's lawyer, I should say.<eos> Your dad is in the next room.<eos> By law, I have to let your lawyer up here unless you tell me not to, or you can sign this waiver and just talk to me.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Sarah, you could've asked me for a lawyer at any time,<eos> - but you didn't.
Dracula is abroad in the land.<eos> He has an army of monsters.<eos> He's determined to wipe out all human life wherever he finds it.<eos> Is that what you believe?<eos> That Dracula's released his horde in Wallachia?<eos> That's fact.<eos> There's no "belief" involved.<eos> But that's not what you're asking.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
♪ It seems today that all you see ♪<eos> ♪ Is violence in movies and sex on TV ♪<eos> ♪ But where are those good old-fashioned values ♪<eos> ♪ On which we used to rely?<eos> I got to say, some days I wish I didn't have a sister.<eos> Oh...<eos> - What? - Nothing.<eos> Oh, I thought you asked me what was going on with my sister.<eos> I did not.
Dr. Hartman, were you able to tell anything from Stewie's X rays?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Little guy's got scoliosis.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, no, am I gonna be a big-shoe, small-shoe guy?<eos> But don't worry, he'll be fine.<eos> He just needs to wear this brace for a while - to correct it.<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> Now, does he have any school pictures coming up?<eos> Yeah, he actually does.
Whenever something happens, it's his word against mine, and he knows what to say and how to say it.<eos> There are support groups or shelters you can go to.<eos> If your story checks out, I'll even help you find one.<eos> But right now, I need to...<eos> My god.<eos> Did he do that?<eos> Yes, officer.<eos> He did.<eos> Do you have a gun?<eos> I do.
- Where have you been?<eos> With Chrissy.<eos> Your turn.<eos> Do you know what he did?<eos> Do you know why he's in prison?<eos> He's a murderer.<eos> So?<eos> That's why I told you he was dead.<eos> I want to see him.<eos> You don't.
I know every single employee.<eos> Do you know how many Antonio Garcías or Dolores Ruizes there are here?<eos> You did the right thing by informing me, but... I'd like this to remain as it is, merely an unfortunate coincidence.<eos> -Yes, of course, sir.<eos> -Thank you, Ángeles.<eos> [Ángeles] If you'll excuse me.<eos> Talk to her. Stop her from telling anyone else.<eos> I'm sorry you had to lie again because of me.<eos> -I don't care about that.<eos> -Well, I do.
-Ángeles... [laughing]<eos> Keep on deceiving yourself.<eos> It's your marriage, not mine.<eos> Yes, it's my marriage.<eos> He's my husband.<eos> You didn't see anything.<eos> You made it up.<eos> She didn't make it up, Ángeles.<eos> She didn't see him with someone else.<eos> I did.
If it's still available, of course.<eos> [Sara] Yes, of course.<eos> If it's up to me, you can count on it.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> [Alba] Sometimes the only way to fight a lie is to face it.<eos> No one can live life with their back turned to reality...<eos> -Let's talk, Ángeles!<eos> -[Alba] ...as much as they may want to.<eos> -I don't want to talk.<eos> -Well, I do!
Come on, Joe, let's put this 70's siren on your car and go.<eos> Did you just wipe a booger on my roof?<eos> Let's go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Oh, crap!<eos> Cops!<eos> That's the house!<eos> Hold on, Peter, we can't go in there.<eos> We got to wait for backup.<eos> The hell we do!
Top-four... I mean, asshole got an honorable mention from this prick.<eos> And I don't know how to get on the podium.<eos> That's not constructive criticism at all.<eos> I can't even see it.<eos> It just messes with you.<eos> I've got to walk around in my life not knowing which three bitches I've got to kill.<eos> This actor, he wanted to go out of the house all the time.<eos> "Let's dress sexy and get out of the house."<eos> I was, like, "I can be sexy, if you like nights in and some opinions."<eos> He did not.
They do amazing things throughout the U.K.<eos> But it was a sponsors event.<eos> You know what that means?<eos> It was full of really posh people.<eos> It was a polo match.<eos> The guest list looked like the Panama Papers.<eos> It was just, like, very...<eos> And in this country, I've noticed that posh people think that only other posh people are on their level and care about them.<eos> See, we don't even have class in Canada.<eos> We genuinely don't, right?
Oh, how disappointing.<eos> I don't know why I lost the rope.<eos> I had it and then...<eos> Oh well... I wasn't expecting to get this far, and I'm happy.<eos> I would've loved to get further, but...<eos> Oh, a disappointing end for Ivan Zepeda.<eos> Next up is César Curti from Brazil.<eos> And let's see if he can make an all-Brazil final a reality.<eos> Does he have enough speed? Does he have enough speed?<eos> - He does!
Is he going to be our third finalist to finish Level 1 tonight?<eos> You're talking about an ice climber.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is right in his wheelhouse.<eos> Just sit back like you're at the movies. Get comfortable.<eos> Is he gonna go for that Point Thruster?<eos> You know he's going for that Point Thruster.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Heeyong Park don't mess around.<eos> - No, he doesn't!
I was recently in North Carolina and I went into this bar, and I asked the bartender for an Old Fashioned.<eos> So he took away my voting rights.<eos> I was like, "Whoa, that's..."<eos> "Whoa! Whoa!"<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> I'm Latina. I don't vote.<eos> We don't vote!<eos> We don't vote!<eos> Not unless it's American Idol or The Voice, right? We don't do it!<eos> We don't do it.
If I get it out in the next eight minutes, it won't cause nerve damage.<eos> Why was it a failure?<eos> All of the test subjects who had the bio-drive put in died after three months.<eos> Three months?<eos> But...<eos> I was in that tank for ten years.<eos> Then you don't know your own expiration date.<eos> Sucks for you.<eos> Why would the Shepherds put the bio-drive in him?<eos> We didn't, all right?
- It was me.<eos> I said those things. - Do you think we can trust Ivy?<eos> I'm not a hundred percent sure.<eos> I know what quantum computers are and how entanglement triggers work.<eos> He had surgery a couple days ago, and since we're locked down, I have no idea how he's doing.<eos> Call.<eos> Find out.<eos> He died. The funeral was yesterday.<eos> - You know where she is.<eos> - I do.
- Maybe the killer left some behind.<eos> - You got it.<eos> Find anything?<eos> No bag. No phone.<eos> Just a lot of unsettlingly green artificial grass.<eos> Well, I couldn't find anything inside.<eos> If Sabine hid something here, she made sure Nic couldn't find it.<eos> - Okay. - Mm. Okay, hold on.<eos> You don't want to?<eos> No, I... I do.
You got it, boss.<eos> So define "a cuddle." Was there spooning?<eos> Instead of you asking me inappropriate questions and me avoiding them, can I interest you in a little trouble?<eos> Go on.<eos> To save my mother, we need to perfect stitching, right?<eos> Go on!<eos> And to perfect stitching, we need to fully map the human brain, right?<eos> And now that Cameron has me piloting the stitches...<eos> Then we can spend a little more time in the regions that we need to map.<eos> - Okay, except that we don't...

Market, crossing Geary.<eos> DeBray's in the car ahead of me with Sarneau.<eos> All right, I'll see you in 30 seconds.<eos> I'm headed out the door.<eos> If you want to shoot me in the back, my spinal column starts right here.<eos> Get an ambulance!<eos> Stand back, sir.<eos> Hey, hey! What did you have to tell me?<eos> They stopped looking for... ffor me.<eos> Who did?
So why can't we just get his name off the ticket?<eos> Mm, that's because he doesn't have a ticket.<eos> So how did he get on the plane?<eos> That's exactly what we're trying to find out.<eos> So, we located his partner in the crowd at the gate.<eos> He's sitting right there on his laptop, across from the woman scanning tickets.<eos> He never gets on the plane.<eos> That's it.<eos> I couldn't figure out how they were able to hack the airline's secured server.<eos> They didn't.
This is his revenge, making up crazy accusations just to annoy me.<eos> He had one more concern.<eos> Apparently you texted him accidentally at 1:00 in the morning.<eos> Who were you actually meeting?<eos> That was meant for a colleague of mine who also works late.<eos> We walk to the garage together for safety.<eos> This is why he called you in?<eos> Well, that and the fact that someone tried to kill him last night.<eos> Tried to kill him?<eos> Who did?
Thanks, Eric.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Well, the club doesn't open for another hour, so we are just gonna hang out here.<eos> You want a salsa lesson?<eos> Uh, no, no. I'm-I'm quite all right, thank you.<eos> It's free.<eos> And I'm very good.<eos> I imagine you're fantastic, but I'm-I'm good, thank you.<eos> We do have an hour to kill.<eos> We do.
Look, the risk was accounted for in the prospectus.<eos> Now's not the time to change strategies.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Talk soon.<eos> Mallory Fletcher.<eos> Special Agent Kensi Blye, NCIS.<eos> Special Agent Chegwidden.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Do you know a man named Yaniv Kornberg?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Move!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Well, what did you expect?<eos> You left us with motorcycles.<eos> And guns.<eos> And you?<eos> Next time you try to ditch somebody, make sure they can't catch an Uber.<eos> Son of a bitch stole my line.<eos> You know we could've shot you, right?<eos> But you didn't.
Soon.<eos> "in the near future," but i didn't say "in the near future,"<eos> 'cause "in the near future" is three more words than "soon."<eos> "In" one, "the" two, "near" three, "future" four.<eos> See "in the near future" is four, "soon" is just one, four is more than one;<eos> Saving time already.<eos> Genius.<eos> I was gonna say,<eos> "why does anyone think Sheldon's a genius?"<eos> But I didn't.
Something on your mind? No, no, nothing.<eos> (Chuckles)<eos> Okay, well, maybe I'm just feeling like something's bothering you.<eos> Nope, all good.<eos> Prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor.<eos> No, what is wrong with you?<eos> Aha, you are upset.<eos> I don't know a lot about women, but I know I upset them.<eos> Howard, I'm sorry if I'm being weird, but it has nothing to do with you.<eos> It doesn't? No.
So, Penny, what's going on with you?<eos> How's the job?<eos> Uh, it's okay, I'm still in pharmaceutical sales.<eos> She's doing amazing.<eos> She can actually make a side effect, like 10% chance of liver failure, sound like a 90% chance of liver success.<eos> Yeah, lying isn't my favorite part of the job.<eos> Actually, I'm not crazy about a lot of it.<eos> Hey, if you're not happy there, I've been looking for a new head of sales at my company.<eos> And we don't sell drugs, just menus, so the only lie you'll be telling is we print on recycled paper.<eos> We don't.
Oh, not now, honey.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> I-I just, you know, missed you a lot, and I just thought maybe you...<eos> Yeah, look, I've missed you too, but I'm not in the mood!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, that's fine.<eos> I'll go make us some chambourgulon.<eos> [groaning] [yelps cheerfully]<eos> Hey, slugger, how you doing?
Spock, find me the rest of that kill code.<eos> I'll be on the bridge.<eos> Jim?<eos> How is it with you and Avi?<eos> She's an incredible engineer.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> You remember.<eos> We each chose our separate paths.<eos> Nothing's changed.<eos> With enough time some things do.
Do you understand there's no way we can distribute this amount?<eos> I do.<eos> And do you understand that if we don't get that first payment, a fleet of El Santo's hit men are gonna be on the next flight to Dallas.<eos> El Santo gave us no choice.<eos> I don't remember asking you a damn thing.<eos> He said take a metric ton or nothing.<eos> I understand it put us in danger.<eos> So why'd you do it?<eos> Because now you have a choice.<eos> With nothing, you don't.
I married your mother.<eos> And for the first time since I lost my parents, I didn't feel alone.<eos> I took over the farm.<eos> And when the Crocodile came around to collect his money, I had to beg for the life of my family.<eos> The only reason he spared them was because I agreed to grow marijuana on our farm.<eos> Whatever happened to the Crocodile?<eos> The Federales ran him out of the country.<eos> I got into this life so you wouldn't have to come home and see your mother and father hanging from a tree.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> You do.
Why would you think that they're...<eos> He's engaged, and she's...<eos> Goldilocks looking for the one that's just right. Okay.<eos> Now I know it's not good to see you. I'm telling you... he thought he could be in a boy band, wanted to call himself "Cal,"<eos> wrote letters to, uh, NSYNC and Backstreet, 98 Degrees, even Lou Pearlman.<eos> Well, hey there, Cal.<eos> I thought you were headed back to Berkeley.<eos> Well, I couldn't leave without saying goodbye to mi familia.<eos> Do you know that word... "goodbye"?<eos> No, you don't.
And I'm sure you still have a good shot of getting in.<eos> It's, it's...<eos> Look.<eos> The good news is that Rafferty is not the only game in town.<eos> Okay?<eos> Hutner has this amazing mentoring program, where they pair up students with working designers.<eos> And Bayard has this top-notch business program.<eos> You could learn how to be an omnipreneur.<eos> You guys don't think I'm gonna get in to Rafferty.<eos> - No, no, of course we do.
You know, I got to say,<eos> - I'm surprised at Piper. - Right?<eos> She doesn't seem like a "Barbie's Dreamliner"<eos> - kind of girl. - But you know what?<eos> This is good; she's going against her instincts.<eos> Jason's got to get in there and build on the friendship.<eos> That's not exactly what I told him.<eos> You didn't tell him<eos> - to fight for her?<eos> - Well, he did.
But why not?<eos> The higher-ups but a block on him.<eos> He's gen pop all the way.<eos> But SSA Reid is in extreme danger.<eos> Who here isn't?<eos> There are extenuating circumstances.<eos> Know how many times a day I hear that?<eos> I give in to him, the other will come crying.<eos> SSA Reid has rights.<eos> He sure does.
That's a new one on me.<eos> Whoever did this, they they knew we were there.<eos> Maybe the same person that talked to the reporter talked to the collaborators, tipped them off as to what we were doing.<eos> I don't think that's true.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Will they pull the plug on this operation?<eos> They wouldn't do that.<eos> We just need a new angle, a new plan.<eos> What we need is to admit we screwed up.<eos> We didn't.
Why don't you make yourself comfortable?<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll make the drinks.<eos> He took the phones.<eos> - What are those?<eos> - Kamikazes.<eos> Well, aren't you guys gonna have one?<eos> We just did.
Well...<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you have, like, a bathroom or something?<eos> Yeah, yeah, just down the hall.<eos> Okay, we've had so much to drink.<eos> I was wondering where you went.<eos> Let's have some fun.<eos> - I don't want this.<eos> - Sure you do.
I'll teach you whatever you want to know.<eos> What is it you want to know?<eos> So, how is Hawaii Boy?<eos> He's great.<eos> And his name is Kalei.<eos> Well, tell him Ka-hey for me.<eos> Will do.<eos> You still have a thing for her, huh?<eos> Who says I have a thing for her?<eos> Who doesn't?
So we did what anyone would've done...<eos> You know what I would've done?<eos> I would've taken DNA from a frog and put it into a T. Rex, like a little mini Jurassic Park, you know what I...<eos> You didn't do that, did you?<eos> - Uh, no, not exactly.<eos> - Okay.<eos> We asked the cops for blood samples.<eos> Uh, closed cases, so we could...<eos> Create a control group to see if your technique actually worked.<eos> And it did.
Riley, is there any way you can trace this back to the killer?<eos> I'm trying, but so far, no luck.<eos> If they know I'm still alive and they can't find me, they're gonna go after my parents.<eos> I need to just get them in the car and leave town.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> These guys are not gonna stop until they find you.<eos> And besides, if you leave now, you won't be able to finish your work.<eos> Oh, my work?<eos> Yeah, who cares about my work?<eos> I do.
If your intuition told you that this guy had knowledge, why didn't you keep better tabs on him to begin with?<eos> And another thing, how could you lose someone moments after he called you to talk?<eos> Explain that.<eos> I can't explain that.<eos> I was sitting right there.<eos> I picked up the phone, he was gone. You know?<eos> I-I don't know what to say.<eos> I had to trace the call to find his motel room.<eos> You let your only possible witness get snatched from underneath your nose, and you still think I should keep you on this case?<eos> I do.
Let's go.<eos> I stashed the ambulance behind the house.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> His ventilator's almost out of juice, so we had to plug it into an outlet.<eos> Good job.<eos> What? I plugged a thing into a thing.<eos> I don't mean that specifically.<eos> In general, good job.<eos> You didn't have to, um...<eos> Um, yeah, I did.
Come on.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> No? Maybe the guy didn't get second thoughts.<eos> Maybe that's when they grabbed him.<eos> You don't know, and you can't blame yourself for that, Danny.<eos> Come on. You're a good cop.<eos> I'm a good cop? Now I'm a good cop?<eos> You didn't want me around in the first place.<eos> I'm a good cop. You're right.<eos> I didn't.
No.<eos> I'm just making sure we put away the right guy.<eos> This has nothing to do with the Valentine case.<eos> This is about you.<eos> Standing on the ledge of your career, looking down at all the outlaw moves you pulled in the gang unit and being haunted by them.<eos> Which is not my problem. You would be well advised<eos> - not to try and make it...<eos> - Denny, don't you want to kn...<eos> Lieutenant. don't you wanna know what happened?<eos> Already do.
Corey Jenkins retracted his statement. - And why is that?<eos> - Who knows?<eos> He's 14.<eos> He's scared.<eos> Come on, Hank.<eos> Look, Lavar Spann is the bigger catch.<eos> He brainwashed and recruited these kids. He orchestrated these robberies.<eos> We've been through this, Sergeant.<eos> - You don't have anything on...<eos> - Yes, we do.
The tech guys are trying to figure out who posted the YouTube video.<eos> No luck yet.<eos> So Toronto PD told us the Perv Hunters, they've become a real pain in the ass.<eos> Technically, they don't break any laws, but they've jacked up a few investigations.<eos> Okay, so who's the boss? They don't have one.<eos> They're more like a franchise.<eos> Perv Hunters have dropped ambush videos in Winnipeg, Montreal, Vancouver.<eos> The first one hit the States in Chicago last month.<eos> Yeah, but burning people alive? That's not their MO.<eos> They do public shaming videos,
I thought so.<eos> Anyway, I want to do a piece on Darius Tanz.<eos> Something splashy to earn my keep at Capitol Eyes.<eos> You think you could grease the wheels for me?<eos> You don't have clearance to be in this area.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> I got lost on the way to the loo.<eos> I'll help you find your way back.<eos> Liam, you have a visitor in the lobby.<eos> I do?
I did what I thought was right.<eos> I guess you thought this was right, too.<eos> I believe this is yours.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I thought it was an accident at first.<eos> Maybe it got caught on my clothes, fell into the briefcase.<eos> That's before I knew how far you were willing to go.<eos> Just how far did you go, Grace?<eos> - Right now, that doesn't matter.<eos> - It does to me.
Hacking proprietary technology.<eos> If you know that, you'd also know I countersued, because those companies stole from me.<eos> The drives we took from Tanz this morning were wiped clean.<eos> That's fairly incriminating, don't you think?<eos> They have an automatic kill switch.<eos> Just smart tech designed to prevent espionage.<eos> You're wasting time...<eos> Time you don't have.<eos> - You have the wrong man!<eos> - Do I? !
Maybe a Hallmark card.<eos> "Sorry I made you steal uranium for my ark."<eos> Soon as I get my "Sorry I let them waterboard you" card in the mail.<eos> Darius, I'm sorry. I...<eos> I'm desperately sorry for what happened, and I want to believe you, but right now, I have too many questions and not enough answers.<eos> I can't go back to the Pentagon without proof the EmDrive works.<eos> Okay, follow me.<eos> You want proof?<eos> You want answers?<eos> Yes, I do.
Listen to your friend.<eos> 911, my professor, his place is trashed.<eos> He didn't show up for class.<eos> There were big scary goons staking out his house.<eos> They chased my ass across town.<eos> We're plotting possible intercept courses with the asteroid to see which countries have available spacecraft out near Samson.<eos> Then we'll approach them about a collaborative mission.<eos> But we still don't know who was behind the hack.<eos> How do we know who we can trust?<eos> We don't.
- Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop.<eos> God, it was you?<eos> You're the mole.<eos> Karissa, I can't raise Liam or Nelson on the phone.<eos> Tracking them.<eos> Their signals are... dead.<eos> When did they check in at the offsite facility?<eos> They didn't.
And you can ask me as many questions as you like to figure it out.<eos> But you only get one guess as to what it is.<eos> Now, guess correctly, I take your phone, I call our friend Lindsey, and I tell her to release your mother unharmed.<eos> If you don't...<eos> There's always a clock.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Now, you'll have 4 hours. Not yet.<eos> You have to wait till the second hand comes around.<eos> You want to give me a hint before we start? Do I look like a girl that gives hints?<eos> Actually you do.
No. Because we caught the man who killed him.<eos> What about Agent Morgan?<eos> And your guilt over not visiting his little boy.<eos> I was in prison.<eos> Yeah, but you had time before that.<eos> Why didn't you go?<eos> Truthfully, I got distracted.<eos> I was trying to figure out a way to help my mom.<eos> She didn't have time.<eos> Morgan, Savannah, and little Bobby did.
I do know.<eos> I know two inmates, Frazier and Duerson, killed your friend Delgado in front of you.<eos> And I know they wanted you to move their heroin, and I also know that if you didn't, you would have been next, right?<eos> Spence, anyone in your spot would have done the same thing. You wouldn't have.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I would have, Spence.<eos> If someone was threatening my life, you bet your ass I would.<eos> It doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> 'Cause you know who does think like that, that... that in you doing what you had to do to survive somehow makes you a psychopath?<eos> She does.

You wouldn't have.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I would have, Spence.<eos> If someone was threatening my life, you bet your ass I would.<eos> It doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> 'Cause you know who does think like that, that... that in you doing what you had to do to survive somehow makes you a psychopath?<eos> She does.<eos> She does.

Let's see if you can...<eos> Let's see if you can get out of here alive.<eos> From now on... your name is Lin Kai.<eos> An older colleague once said, don't be scared even if you wake up in a nightmare.<eos> Just remember who you are.<eos> I must remember...<eos> My name is Lin Kai.<eos> I'm a drug trafficker.<eos> Who wants to play?<eos> I do, Father!
The autopsy results are in.<eos> Mom?<eos> You're out.<eos> I called to tell you that debts are meant to be repaid, and after this, we won't owe anyone.<eos> I love you.<eos> For my children<eos> I don't even know where to begin.<eos> I love you, with all my heart.<eos> You must have so many questions.<eos> So do I.
I'll leave it open.<eos> Dad, it's me...<eos> That's all you have?<eos> Yeah...<eos> This... and the photos.<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> -We have to bust them out. -[Zyan] How?<eos> He doesn't give out names, streets, or anything.<eos> [Ovni] I can check if he recorded the video with the location function on, but... [keyboard clicking]<eos> -No. No, he didn't.
I don't know.<eos> Canek went to find her.<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have to leave.<eos> We can't stay here.<eos> What if she talks?<eos> They'll nab us.<eos> No, Dolores won't tell them anything.<eos> -How do you know?<eos> -I just do.
What are you going to do?<eos> Mr. Urquiza.<eos> The jet's ready.<eos> I'll be going to Los Pinos first.<eos> Emiliano!<eos> -I don't want to leave.<eos> -Emiliano.<eos> I need you to try and remember.<eos> Do you remember where your mom and sister went after the Independence Day ceremony last year?<eos> No, Grandpa, I don't.
[Almada] With the utmost adherence to the law, we've ordered a national operation that will sweep the areas where organized crime operates and where we suspect the masterminds and perpetrators of the assassination are hiding.<eos> Those sons of bitches are headed to our barrio.<eos> You're losing a lot of blood.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> I'm the one asking the questions.<eos> I thought I was doing the right thing... but they used me.<eos> Just like they used Diego.<eos> Like they used you.<eos> The CIA also assassinates presidents and kidnaps teenagers?<eos> Or do the cartels do it for them?
Maybe.<eos> No.<eos> It's just that they're all so... insanely competitive, and they're gonna think of me as a failure.<eos> I know.<eos> You think I'm insanely competitive, too.<eos> I think you have an admirable drive for excellence.<eos> Oh. God, I'm just as bad as they are.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I have to go back to my desk.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I'm a cynic, but II draw the line at trying to destroy democracy.<eos> And II certainly wouldn't trade on our relationship.<eos> Well, you should have told me up front.<eos> There was nothing to tell you.<eos> And by the way, I don't work for you.<eos> I'm not one of your little people.<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> Come on.<eos> And I do want to see paystubs.<eos> Of course you do.
So nice to meet you.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Hello.<eos> A little late, Leonard.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?<eos> It's not important.<eos> I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate.<eos> Don't you agree?<eos> I do.
Bye! - Bye!<eos> - Old-fashioned.<eos> - I got you. Old-fashioned.<eos> And one of these.<eos> So, what's it like being a strategist for the only coalition of states saying "no" to the convention?<eos> It doesn't much matter.<eos> Roarke has his 38 states.<eos> Still, I wrote a hell of a barnburner for the New York delegation to give during floor debate.<eos> Why does this feel like a double date all of a sudden?<eos> My God. It does!
All kids do.<eos> Casey, this is a family dinner.<eos> I've been cooking all day. This is important to me.<eos> Only you would invite someone to a family dinner without even asking.<eos> Sam... and friends.<eos> So many people!<eos> This is awesome.<eos> Zahid's my friend. Paige is just a girl from school.<eos> Come on in. You know the drill.<eos> I certainly do.
Dad.<eos> Why are we all saying each other's names?<eos> Guys, why don't you go sit on the sofa and talk amongst yourselves?<eos> And I'll be there in a minute.<eos> Maybe tell an embarrassing story about yourself that nobody else knows.<eos> We did that as an icebreaker at Sam's camp last summer and, boy, were there some red faces.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ay, yai, yai. These kids are a pain in the ass. Did we make enough food?<eos> You are adorable.<eos> Yes, we did.
Meatball is...<eos> You met Meatball. He worked here.<eos> Right.<eos> So, Meatball was, um...<eos> Big guy, goatee.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Meatball.<eos> Yeah. I never spoke with him, but he had a kind face.<eos> Yeah, he did.
There's some people that got it, but then there's some, like, "Is she giving chickens away?"<eos> Every weekend, she has a chicken and she gives it away?<eos> "That's expensive."<eos> But now they made up.<eos> Now they're friends.<eos> Best of friends.<eos> Seeing my mom and sister make up: Funniest shit ever.<eos> Just seeing my mom cry.<eos> "I just want you to know that... I didn't think you gave your pekpek away to everybody."<eos> "Well, I didn't, Mom.
Oh! LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I told you they'd make a mess.<eos> Oh, quick!<eos> (Jane screaming) Welcome. Welcome to the Marbella.<eos> Sorry the Fairwick failed you.<eos> Next time, maybe choose a hotel that has a safety plan.<eos> Wait. We can't do this.<eos> We have to keep this room clear for the Villanueva wedding.<eos> We're in the middle of a hurricane.<eos> Rafael was very clear. He promised Jane.<eos> Of course he did.
Oh, yeah?<eos> ! You think you're so smart? !<eos> Okay!<eos> I'm eating your dog food!<eos> This is on you!<eos> Mmm. Oh, yeah.<eos> Not one student showed up to school just because a pack of ferocious, masterless dogs are roaming the playground.<eos> Ow! Damn it!<eos> I thought we sent Willie out there to deal with them.<eos> I did.
The whole world is just made of people who didn't kill themselves today.<eos> That's who's here.<eos> It's all of us that went, "Okay, fuck it, keep doing it."<eos> It's... [audience cheering]<eos> Life can get very difficult, very sad, very upsetting. But you don't have to do it.<eos> You don't have to do it.<eos> You don't have to do anything.<eos> You never have to do anything because you can kill yourself.<eos> If they send you a letter from Motor Vehicles, come in and:<eos> "No, I don't.
I'm like, "You all right?<eos> Are you all right?"<eos> My kids are terrified of the dog.<eos> My daughter goes to pet the dog, dog goes like...<eos> She's like, "Should I pet her?" "I don't think you should ever pet our dog, honey."<eos> I took her to the vet. I took the dog to ask her what to do.<eos> The vet said, "Listen, I think there's something you should seriously consider."<eos> I was like, "Please be saying to kill this dog.<eos> Please be a doctor that says the dog dies now."<eos> But she didn't.
I am Lieutenant Cyril Figgis, LAPD, you sentient shit-sacks!<eos> - And if you'd show it to me again...<eos> I don't... whoever hit me took it.<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> And my service weapon! And yet they left you your lighter.<eos> Wait. When I got pistol-whipped, I was talking to an English guy.<eos> We don't have an English guy.<eos> I... you have to remember me!<eos> Uh, actually, I don't.<eos> And also, I don't, so...
You wanted to kill me.<eos> Prepared.<eos> I was prepared to kill you.<eos> Being prepared for something doesn't necessarily speak to desire.<eos> And here we are!<eos> Congratulations, I'm told you're opening offices in Paris and London.<eos> My accountant's untimely demise left the door wide open for you to purchase that fleet of cruise ships for a song.<eos> Well, now...<eos> I know what happened with Von Hauser.<eos> Everyone does.
Maybe I didn't make myself clear, we're going to be arrested.<eos> And there is nothing reddington can do to protect us against that.<eos> To be honest, that's what makes me the angriest.<eos> That here we are, at the end, and we still don't know why he walked into your life that day.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To do something I should have done a long time ago.<eos> Once kaplan testifies, an indictment is inevitable.<eos> Cooper tried to shut it down.<eos> Harold has to work within the system.<eos> Henry Prescott does not.
Enough to get him killed?<eos> It was pretty innocuous.<eos> Did he tell you who he was sleeping with?<eos> No. He was there to teach my daughter.<eos> Tight little town, gay man.<eos> How did that work?<eos> It worked fine.<eos> Here, you contribute, you're in.<eos> - Everybody loved him.<eos> - Well, somebody didn't.
You know Dr. Marr sacked Niall Swift the morning of his murder?<eos> D.S. Redford got the information from his daughter.<eos> - Her local knowledge...<eos> - We better bring him in, then.<eos> - The point I'm making is...<eos> - I know the point you're making.<eos> Her daughter and her pals left the bones on the beach.<eos> Until I'm convinced they know nothing about the heart, D.S. Redford is compromised.<eos> Plus, you fancy her.<eos> No, I don't.
Tell me how to stop the hybrids, and I will help you.<eos> Jackson, do you really think I brought you here so that we could have a hearttoheart?<eos> Brother to sister?<eos> So you could convince me of the error of my ways?<eos> Save my soul?<eos> No.<eos> You're here for one reason:<eos> Your ability to communicate with the animal kingdom.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Why in the world did you do this?
Dad, what's going on?<eos> Everything's going to be okay.<eos> We're just helping Auntie Jamie fix the plane.<eos> But I need you to stay here.<eos> Once the plane is good as new, Mommy and Daddy will be right back, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Dad.<eos> I miss home.<eos> I know.<eos> I do, too.
I took that anger and channeled it at her.<eos> I was like, "Hey!<eos> You're not my sister."<eos> But she couldn't understand English.<eos> But she got what I was saying.<eos> She starts crying and runs out.<eos> I was like, "No!<eos> She's going to tell Dad."<eos> Let's focus on what's important here.<eos> But she didn't.
I'm going to fucking kill you." Click.<eos> And my dad's looking at me.<eos> Do you ever see your parents, and you see the mortality in them?<eos> I'm looking at my dad and I see all five-seven of him.<eos> And that's when I realize I'm a darapok.<eos> I'm a scaredy-cat.<eos> We can speak two languages.<eos> We can speak at home and outside.<eos> I should have said something.<eos> I didn't.
We love that you come over and study.<eos> But tonight is one of those nights...<eos> We have a lot of family back home in Nebraska and we're going to be taking photos, so we don't think you'd be a good fit.<eos> Do you need a ride home?<eos> Mr Reed can give you a ride home."<eos> And I was like, "No, I have my bike."<eos> And I just biked home and played Mario Kart.<eos> That's the nicest I've ever been dressed, playing Mario Kart.<eos> I wish I had said, "Fuck that, I'm going to the dance."<eos> I didn't.
Aisha goes, "Come home, now."<eos> I was like, "I got a set at the Comedy Store.<eos> I'm going to do that, then I'll come home."<eos> And I did a set at the Comedy Store.<eos> And then I drove home.<eos> And I don't know why...<eos> I get to Kaiser and run upstairs.<eos> My mom and my sisters are crying.<eos> My sister looks at me, she's like, "They don't know what you did.<eos> I do."
You can do better than that.<eos> That's the one.<eos> - No joke.<eos> Body was found in Soledad Canyon.<eos> Woman walking her dogs found him.<eos> She was way out there?<eos> She's got mean dogs.<eos> LAPD was canvassing for witnesses, so far nothing.<eos> He didn't just fall from the sky.<eos> Or did he?
I won't.<eos> I promise, I promise.<eos> Hi.<eos> You must be Kirsten.<eos> Yes!<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> Come in.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Cameron didn't tell me your name.<eos> Of course he didn't.
For twenty years have I served you and God as the Archbishop to Targoviste Cathedral.<eos> Yet never before have I felt the love of God shine so upon this great city.<eos> A little more than one year ago, many of us suffered a vision during the God-willed punishment of a witch in our midst.<eos> The devil himself came to us and threatened us with doom in one year.<eos> And yet, here we are.<eos> The devil lied.<eos> Why should we be surprised?<eos> Do we not know the devil for a liar?<eos> Do we not know his works to be illusion?<eos> Of course we do.
Cone's being dusted.<eos> Let me see the guidance systems chip.<eos> Almost.<eos> See if you can increase the through put by another ten percent.<eos> I'm not sure what the rush is.<eos> We can't even launch the thing. The Russians are just gonna shoot it out of the sky.<eos> The EmDrive will take weeks to propel the gravity tractor up to that asteroid.<eos> We need to work fast and hope that the government ends this geopolitical quagmire in time.<eos> Since when do you have faith in the government?<eos> I don't.
Yeah. - Do you still know slight of hand?<eos> - I still know a little bit of it.<eos> - Could you do it with a French fry?<eos> - Sure.<eos> It's OK. It's OK.<eos> It's OK.<eos> It's for you.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> - You have a child now.<eos> - I do.
You're an adult.<eos> You can control your bowels.<eos> No, it's getting pointy.<eos> Can we just take an intermission?<eos> No!<eos> No fucking intermission!<eos> They ruin the flow of the show.<eos> Would you stop the Super Bowl halfway through to do a bunch of bullshit?<eos> You are not leaving to go to the bathroom.<eos> [moans softly] OK, I don't...
Hand goes up, mouths go shut.<eos> [all boo]<eos> You may all be in your mid-20s, but here at Firewood, you're campers.<eos> - Oh, come on, Beth.<eos> We're grown-ups now. - [all murmuring]<eos> With social security cards and everything.<eos> Yeah. We drink wine.<eos> And I'm, like, getting really into amber beers, like Schleinbach.<eos> I like to curl up with a good book.<eos> - Oh, yes. - We all do, we all do.
Yeah!<eos> Which you were gonna get, by the way.<eos> But now you're not.<eos> I'll probably do it with the first guy in college with a British accent.<eos> So thanks for that!<eos> You know what else isn't in there?<eos> The penguin necklace you got me.<eos> I lost it, at some point, last Tuesday, and I really, really miss it.<eos> And I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want to hurt your feelings.<eos> But now I do!
Yes, we'll see about that.<eos> Uh-huh. Here comes another story now.<eos> And whatever you choose, this one won't be so easy.<eos> Two tales you must choose between...<eos> Pirate Cat or Evil Queen.<eos> Pirate stuff. It is just the best!<eos> There is no way I am going to choose the Evil Queen.<eos> I heard you say "choose the Evil Queen." So be it.<eos> No!<eos> I did not.
Politeness.<eos> En Garde!<eos> Oh, you should have stayed in the story.<eos> Think of what fun it would have been.<eos> It was no fun at all.<eos> I was maimed and beaten in every way imaginable.<eos> Oh, I didn't say fun for you.<eos> Ah-ha! Just as Dulcinea's power came from her mirror, your power comes from your pen.<eos> What?<eos> Uh, no, it doesn't.
- No?<eos> - No, sorry.<eos> Well, I'll... I'll see you around then,<eos> - I guess, huh?<eos> - Mason, I can... there's a way out back I know...<eos> - Yeah, I'd like that.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> Thanks, I'll be good.<eos> I know you knew Frankie Belmont.<eos> No, I didn't.
Judge Baird doesn't usually order those.<eos> It gives Tannetti time to change her plea.<eos> We may still have a trial on our hands, gentlemen.<eos> Well, it's not like we're gonna get caught with our pants down.<eos> And we got a case.<eos> Well, yeah, but if we go to trial, we have to establish motive.<eos> And so far...<eos> There's an explanation there somewhere.<eos> I didn't even notice her.<eos> None of us did.
Questions are against the rules.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I will ask you questions instead.<eos> Answer either yes or no to all of them.<eos> First question.<eos> Do people become tougher if they have sex?<eos> I guess some people get tougher.<eos> Yes or no.<eos> Do people get tougher or not?<eos> No, they don't.
I remember now.<eos> You're not with that guy today?<eos> Excuse me, but if you want to talk, could you please sit down?<eos> Then, I will.<eos> Why do you write novels, Mr. Hanaki?<eos> Simply put, it is my mission.<eos> Really?<eos> I didn't think people had a mission.<eos> I don't think everyone has one.<eos> But, like me and yourself, Nanaka, some humans do.
Bring me a copy.<eos> Are you interested in it?<eos> A new emotion?<eos> Those losers have it all wrong.<eos> I will give it a proper judgment.<eos> If you have an idea for your next work, could you tell us about it?<eos> Well, as usual, I will write the kind of work that I'm capable of.<eos> It's time for our final question.<eos> Does anyone else have a question?<eos> I do. I do.
That's Minami's.<eos> It's quite a tragedy that two people have died in the same house.<eos> I hate to do this now, Mr. Michima, but I have a few questions for you.<eos> What kind of work did Ms. Shirakawa do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you know anything about her family?<eos> I know nothing about them either.<eos> When Ms. Shirakawa was 20, her parents went missing.<eos> Did you know about that?<eos> You didn't?
But why protect me?<eos> At first, because I was your fan.<eos> But... then I fell in love with you.<eos> You fell in love?<eos> But, why me?<eos> Do I need a reason to fall in love?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hug me tight.<eos> Why are you doing this, Hitomi?<eos> Just do it.
Really?<eos> That's good.<eos> What's she like?<eos> She's smart, and she's pretty.<eos> And she has a boyfriend... Miles.<eos> Stupid Miles!<eos> Well, that sucks.<eos> But, you know, it's not the end of the world.<eos> Mom had a boyfriend when I first met her.<eos> She did?
I couldn't see them, but they were there.<eos> How do I know that?<eos> You have to stop asking these questions.<eos> Why won't you tell me?<eos> Because you're too young to know.<eos> When will I be old enough?<eos> When your father decides you are.<eos> Mother?<eos> I prayed for my big brother to get better.<eos> And he did.
And you must never tell anyone.<eos> I know you have many questions.<eos> But you need to let them sleep in your heart for now.<eos> Why?<eos> Because your questions are the questions of a child.<eos> But the answers are the answers for a man.<eos> That is one bridge I cannot build.<eos> I don't know how.<eos> But God can, and we must trust him.<eos> I do.
- Dad.<eos> It's gonna be okay, I promise.<eos> I'm gonna work it out.<eos> - He's gonna break his neck.<eos> - I'm gonna break his neck.<eos> Do you really wanna put yourself through this again?<eos> It's a world that doesn't wanna know you.<eos> So what's new?<eos> Are you trying to tell me you never had a dream when you were a kid, Dad?<eos> Course I did.
No pickaxe?<eos> You do realize the time to start jumping is when you're five or six?<eos> Thanks.<eos> The Norwegians already told me that.<eos> Did they also tell you you look ridiculous in that gear?<eos> At least I'm wearing a jacket.<eos> This is my jacket, pal.<eos> Maybe you should wear one, too.<eos> - Drinking doesn't agree with me.<eos> - Neither does ski-jumping.
Dan--<eos> they hung three deserters down in Perry.<eos> Didn't put 'em back in the army.<eos> Just hung 'em.<eos> Yeah, I got a leave.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> A good mama deserves to see her son again.<eos> She don't deserve to see him like that.<eos> No.<eos> No, she don't.
Yeah. You'd kill a man for some corn?<eos> Well, he's asking if I'd kill a man for some corn.<eos> I don't know.<eos> See, lieutenant, you steal our corn, we got nothin' to feed the hogs.<eos> If we can't feed the hogs, we got nothin' to put in the smokehouse. We got nothin' to put in the smokehouse, we starve in the winter.<eos> That's murder, ain't it?<eos> You know what the penalty for murder is, don't you, lieutenant?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Lord.<eos> - But we won.<eos> - I know.<eos> And they said-- general sherman, he said- i know what they said.<eos> -He said 40 acres and a mule for every Freedman and they families.<eos> They took that back.<eos> - Who did?<eos> - President did. There's a new president now name of Johnson.<eos> So who gets all of this?<eos> He does.
Ain't no niggers up there at all.<eos> Got nowhere to go.<eos> They said you was here now making a new farm.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> I'm sorry. I just--<eos> I don't know where to go.<eos> Rebs burned my first farm.<eos> Sherman burned my second.<eos> Guess they agree on that.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Proper union?<eos> Prop--<eos> I was married in this courthouse.<eos> I was married in this courthouse!<eos> But where we gonna go?<eos> We can't get married anywhere else.<eos> Up north, I guess.<eos> We don't know anybody up north.<eos> I understand your client wishes to change his plea, counselor.<eos> Yes, he does, your honor.
I'm giving you a direct order.<eos> The Vanquisher has been eliminated, Bob.<eos> I've known about the elimination for two years, Claire.<eos> You don't have to do the same dirty work this time.<eos> The man inside is the lead terrorist.<eos> Terrorist!<eos> God!<eos> Terrorist!<eos> Who knows how to get the scum of the earth to fuck off and go to hell?<eos> We do, Claire.

- Oh, Seth.<eos> Westbrook High.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Were you in my class?<eos> I was in the year above you.<eos> We didn't hang out or anything.<eos> But I knew who you were.<eos> You did?<eos> Sure.<eos> Everybody did.
You see, I've been terribly busy teaching ancient militiamen to point their rifles at tree stumps.<eos> So, no, no.<eos> No medals for me, Sir."<eos> Tell me... Who is this Secretary Bryce when he's at home?<eos> The last man here upon whom we might possibly rely for advancement.<eos> I see.<eos> I'm getting older, cheeky...<eos> And very impatient of lost years.<eos> I know the medals are ridiculous.<eos> I do.
This is exploration in the jungle.<eos> The environment's brutally difficult...<eos> Terrible disease, murderous savages.<eos> The journey may well mean your life.<eos> At the very least, you will be gone for several years.<eos> But were you to succeed, such an undertaking could earn you soldierly decoration and even reclaim your family name.<eos> You know, we knew your father.<eos> Did you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I did not.
No, you don't understand what's goin' on with us!<eos> With who?<eos> With me and Donnie.<eos> I like it.<eos> You like what?<eos> It.<eos> When he... hurts me.<eos> Oh. I like it.<eos> No. No, no, no.<eos> Yes, I do.
I would much rather give you a demonstration.<eos> Mr. Darcy, is your sister much grown since the spring?<eos> She is now about the same height as Miss Elizabeth Bennet.<eos> I don't believe I've ever met a girl who was so extremely accomplished.<eos> The word "accomplished" is far too liberally applied to young ladies today, but my sister Georgiana does deserve that distinction.<eos> Not only is she a master of the female arts but the deadly as well.<eos> I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that is thus accomplished.<eos> Nor I, I'm sure.<eos> Then, Mr. Darcy, you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman.<eos> I do.
Yeah, you and me, mate.<eos> Go and get the car.<eos> He robbed every bank in Australia at least once.<eos> Then he came to America for a fresh target set.<eos> Doesn't work well with others.<eos> No honor among thieves, eh?<eos> But he tangled with a metahuman and lived to tell about it.<eos> And have you heard of the pyro kinetic homeboy?<eos> How'd you catch him?<eos> We didn't.
What are you really up to?<eos> It's a "need to know", and, all you need to know is you work for me.<eos> That can change with a phone call.<eos> I have friends too, you know.<eos> There you go.<eos> Call'em.<eos> But without you minding her, your lady friend stays here strapped to a board in a drug-induced coma.<eos> They warned me about you.<eos> My dumbass didn't believe the stories.<eos> Nobody does.
Of course not.<eos> A lady is always prepared and I have this always in my purse.<eos> You did not used vegan condoms?<eos> Biodegradable and friendly dolphin.<eos> When I'm slutty, I think it's a nice idea that I'm helping the environment.<eos> Jesus, Bridget.<eos> I can still remember when you bought it.<eos> That was several decades ago.<eos> Sustainability dates say nothing.<eos> Do you?
No, we're not gonna go.<eos> This man insulted you.<eos> And we're not gonna leave until he apologizes.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - Hey, we got a problem here?<eos> - No,no.<eos> - Yeah, we got a big problem.<eos> Your friend, here, really insulted my friend and he needs to apologize.<eos> I don't think he does.<eos> He doesn't.
They say no one's ever seen her and lived to talk about it.<eos> Or, alternately, no one has ever seen her, period.<eos> This is all just stories, okay?<eos> I've been to these woods before. When I was a kid with about 100 other people.<eos> You were part of those search teams?<eos> I remember that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So how come I'm okay?<eos> Nothing got me then.<eos> Maybe it did.
You, my friend... You are going to kill the president of Venezuela.<eos> In two days, our so-called president will throw himself an inauguration ball to celebrate his fifth unelected term.<eos> And there, you will take his life.<eos> And in doing so, you will send a message to the people that greed and corruption will not be tolerated.<eos> And that the revolution has begun.<eos> I understand completely.<eos> It just seems you've got quite a few resources here.<eos> Wow, is that a 50 cal...<eos> Yeah, that's a 50 cal.<eos> Um, why not do it yourself?
Dude, yes.<eos> Come.<eos> Will this work?<eos> I hope they can get blood out of the carpet.<eos> Mr. President, I was hoping to talk to you about Anton Masovich.<eos> I made sure I had Zima for that little pain in the ass.<eos> Man, I so hate all of this.<eos> There are times when I really wanna put a gun in my mouth.<eos> Have you had a job like that, americano?<eos> Actually, I did.
How? How did that...<eos> How did that...?<eos> Wh-what... what...?<eos> Did they just call, or...<eos> They don't just call anybody!<eos> I submitted you, you nutty genius.<eos> You and your marvelous book.<eos> I would've told you earlier, but I was afraid they would reject you.<eos> And there was a very strong possibility of that.<eos> But they didn't.
That would explain why you've never physically matured, - the lack of hair, the boy balls. - The what?<eos> Sometimes the nurses coin a phrase that sticks in your head.<eos> This is the best damn day of my life.<eos> - Well, given its placement,<eos> I think we can remove it fairly easily through your nose.<eos> You're gonna take this life-sucking, puberty-fucking tumor out of my brain through my nose?<eos> Can we go now?<eos> But why couldn't you tell your best friends that you're a weirdo?<eos> - You don't have to answer that. - Why?<eos> Because you just did!
I used to worry that you might be jealous of me.<eos> Oh, stop it.<eos> No, you never did anything to make me feel that way.<eos> But I worried. After I married Jack. After he won the election.<eos> Now that seems ridiculous, anyone... Anyone being jealous of me.<eos> I've buried two children, and now I'm burying my husband.<eos> You know, I was jealous. Of that dress you wore in Vienna.<eos> I know that it's hard to see it right now, but you have your whole life ahead of you.<eos> That's a terrible thing to say.<eos> You do!

Let's get real, Vinny.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You lost three in a row, last one, a title fight, you got nothing lined up 'cause you're not a draw, your own manager, on fucking HBO, said you should hang it up.<eos> The only reason you're standing in my gym is because Lou sent you here to put us both out to pasture.<eos> So, if you want to get this over with, let's get it over with.<eos> You all set?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> This is Manny.<eos> How we doing?
What life?<eos> Upstairs?<eos> No, I can't do it.<eos> This is a fucking Hail Mary at best.<eos> No it's...<eos> No it's not. It's a gamble.<eos> Yeah, I know that.<eos> But, look, if there was a time to roll the dice, this is it.<eos> I mean, you just don't know how to give up.<eos> No, I do.
Well, I've never had anyone to ask.<eos> Well, don't eat the grass. Don't eat the grass.<eos> I guess I shouldn't knock it before I try it.<eos> It's not good.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> What's your plan, Lu?<eos> Lie in the grass?<eos> I mean, with your life.<eos> Did you have a plan?<eos> Yes, of course I did.
- Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's a Napa Valley Cab... little big to drink on its own.<eos> Here's a... ooh! A 2001 L'Armand.<eos> That's more, uh, balanced.<eos> I have to take these... These are just...<eos> This is interesting.<eos> A Rioja, Reserva Especial.<eos> - You speak Spanish?<eos> - No, I don't. Actually, no.
I miss you already.<eos> Ow!<eos> I think the king really likes us.<eos> I know, right?<eos> That was the greatest day of my life!<eos> Thanks, Poppy.<eos> Thanks to all of you!<eos> Even you, I guess.<eos> I just never thought something like that could happen to me.<eos> And it just did!
It was toots over here, the bun.<eos> She grabbed me.<eos> I was just trying to save Frank.<eos> Who is Frank?<eos> You?<eos> - Yeah, I'm Frank.<eos> - The fault is yours, then, huh?<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I didn't mean for any of this to happen.<eos> Well, it did.
No!<eos> No!<eos> No. No.<eos> No!<eos> I fall out of the cart, then I lose Frank, now I'm being hunted by a douche.<eos> The gods must be punishing me, don't you see?<eos> This is what I get for giving in to my disgusting urges.<eos> I'm such a whore.<eos> Sweet bun, I must admit I too sometimes have urges... impure thoughts.<eos> We all do.
Then I did the same thing as...<eos> They killed Carl.<eos> Those fuckers.<eos> Did he suffer?<eos> No...<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, he did. They truly are monsters.<eos> Those monsters are gonna kill Brenda.<eos> She's somewhere out there in a cart.<eos> I tried to warn everyone, they didn't believe me!<eos> Of course they didn't.
And Tom made me feel beautiful again.<eos> But I know now I've lost him to your husband.<eos> Mrs. Bernstein.<eos> My husband always wanted a son... more than anything in the world.<eos> We reached a point when we realized that wasn't going to happen.<eos> And then he met Tom.<eos> I can't let him go.<eos> Aline, go home to your family.<eos> They need you.<eos> Tom doesn't.
Subtle.<eos> Max, please, subtle.<eos> At the bar?<eos> Let's go over there, say hello.<eos> - Come on!<eos> Let's have some fun.<eos> - I can't.<eos> They're working girls, Max.<eos> It doesn't count.<eos> Yes, Tom, it does.
Hey, Ed you talk to these guys yet?<eos> Not yet.<eos> What's going on, guys?<eos> Y'all been out here a while?<eos> Hey, I'm just going to ask you some questions, man.<eos> You don't have to square up on me.<eos> You come over here and blame us for them fools, huh, puto?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> That's exactly what you said, motherfucker.<eos> I didn't.
Felix, come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> No, no.<eos> You ain't gonna do that in front of my son.<eos> Go on.<eos> Find your mother.<eos> Sit down, Michael.<eos> Have some tea.<eos> We have much to discuss.<eos> We do?
Luis Pinto's surrounded by SWAT a couple of blocks from here.<eos> Detective Rodriguez. Homicide.<eos> Detective Allen. Major Crimes.<eos> All right, well maybe we'll get some answers out of him.<eos> What, you think they're just going to arrest him...<eos> Put him in a comfy cell? They're not.<eos> He's right.<eos> You know this guy?<eos> No, I didn't know him.<eos> But Marcus sure did.
I wasn't wrong.<eos> Yes and no.<eos> But yes, the sport makes for fantastic television.<eos> And now you're back.<eos> Sort of.<eos> I like you, Ray.<eos> I feel really bad for what they did to you.<eos> I don't need to look a gift horse up the ass to know there's shit in there.<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> We do.
- Money money...<eos> Nah, nah the good part man.<eos> That is the good part.<eos> It could kill for that money.<eos> The almighty dollar.<eos> Hello, Hollywood.<eos> - Mike!<eos> - What's the word, Dale ? !<eos> - What do you know?<eos> We done? - Not much.
Okay? Hey, life isn't fair sometimes, Nadine, okay? Get over it!<eos> I swear to God.<eos> I swear to God, I'm gonna clock you! Don't touch me, man.<eos> - Stop saying stuff like that!<eos> - Calm down already, man!<eos> Stop it!<eos> What is the matter with you? I...<eos> - I know what this is about.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
What kind of stuff?<eos> Look at these. Wow.<eos> Damn, Erwin.<eos> Yeah, this is mostly unfinished.<eos> Just doodling, mostly.<eos> But not quite where I...<eos> Oh, I think I found my favorite.<eos> Oh, yeah, my parents love that one, too.<eos> - Do they?<eos> - No, they don't.
Damn, Erwin.<eos> Yeah, this is mostly unfinished.<eos> Just doodling, mostly.<eos> But not quite where I...<eos> Oh, I think I found my favorite.<eos> Oh, yeah, my parents love that one, too.<eos> - Do they?<eos> - No, they don't.<eos> That's just... No, they're very conservative.<eos> No. They don't.
That whole deer-in-the-headlights thing is exactly what they want.<eos> Here.<eos> Let me help you with that.<eos> Are you a model?<eos> No, I do makeup.<eos> So, where are you staying?<eos> At a motel in Pasadena.<eos> By yourself?<eos> What do your parents think about that?<eos> They don't really.
Well, I thought I'd get more work if I went down a cup size.<eos> So I look like a hanger. You know?<eos> But then my surgeon, Dr. Andrew, he pointed out a lot of other problems with my body.<eos> So I had them shave my jaw, I had a slight eyebrow lift, new nose, cheeks, inner and outer lipo, oh, and they pinned my ears.<eos> Why?<eos> So I could wear a ponytail.<eos> Didn't it hurt?<eos> Anything worth having hurts a little.<eos> Besides, nobody likes the way they look.<eos> I do.
And we're back in the now.<eos> Who's ready for trust falls?<eos> I gotcha. No, no, no.<eos> Help.<eos> ♪ Mighty, Mighty Eagle Soaring free ♪<eos> ♪ Defender of our homes ♪ ♪ and liberty ♪<eos> ♪ Bravery!

Deep breath, deep breath, deep breath!<eos> How are we gonna get over those walls?<eos> I'll tell you how.<eos> We're gonna fly.<eos> Remember, the goal is the castle.<eos> Get to the castle.<eos> Who wants to go first?<eos> Over here! Me!<eos> Me!<eos> Me! I do! Hey!
Hey, this is David.<eos> Bro, you want to hear something totally fucked up?<eos> Merry Christmas, Efraim.<eos> It's Christmas?<eos> That's why nobody's here.<eos> I was about to fire the entire office.<eos> Anyway, when I was over there, I was talking to our boy, Bashkim.<eos> Did you know his uncle works at the Albanian defense ministry?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> Well, he does.
I can't see.<eos> I can't see any...<eos> I can't see anything.<eos> Wave right here.<eos> He's close.<eos> - Hey! - Hey!<eos> I'm getting nothing but static, sir.<eos> It's that antenna.<eos> I thought you had it looked at.<eos> I did.
And you get some rest, okay?<eos> Oh, Sergeant Tulloch.<eos> Come in.<eos> So, how bad is it?<eos> - You're six weeks along.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Not the reaction you usually get, I'm sure.<eos> Well, it's early days.<eos> You still have options.<eos> No, I don't.
Oh, right, um, I spoke to Councilor Hawick.<eos> He wasn't happy, obviously, but I showed him the ring.<eos> He denied that it was his wife's.<eos> Said hers was buried with her at St. Magnus.<eos> - So, she is dead.<eos> - Three years ago.<eos> Some sort of horse riding accident.<eos> So, the time of death fits.<eos> If she had the boy within two weeks of her death...<eos> She didn't.
The Apple contains the genetic code for free will.<eos> They will use it to destroy us.<eos> I'm gonna find it.<eos> And watch them destroy you and your Creed.<eos> You can not kill the Creed.<eos> It's in your blood.<eos> The Apple is everything.<eos> Your mother died to protect it.<eos> She had no choice.<eos> I do.
Nothing's there. I'm standing right here.<eos> Mac, we're both staring right at it.<eos> It's in the middle of your view port.<eos> What? That?<eos> It's a smear.<eos> Probably these piece-of-shit goggles.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Tell him to put them back on.<eos> - Mac, put the goggles back on.<eos> Mac, do it now.
- And it was set loose, or it broke loose.<eos> - All right, but these things climb.<eos> They're like humans. It looks like a person.<eos> So can marble and clay in the right hands.<eos> And I wanna know why.<eos> Why they look like people.<eos> I can't tell you how they did this.<eos> What I can tell you... is that someone made them.<eos> If someone made them, they don't escape the laws of the world.<eos> Nothing does.
Chanel, Chanel!<eos> I can't bloody work with that shit!<eos> Welcome, everybody, to this month's P.R. person-of-the-month lunch.<eos> Eat.<eos> It's all free.<eos> Nothing is free anymore.<eos> Even freedom isn't free.<eos> It used to be.<eos> But now everybody wants your PIN number.<eos> Sure they do, old girl.

I would rather die than go back to all those hating faces!<eos> I mean, look at me, darling.<eos> All I've ever wanted was not to be fat... and old.<eos> You know, darling.<eos> To just keep the party going.<eos> Now here I am.<eos> Just fat and old and hated... and nothing.<eos> I'm getting in.<eos> Darling, I know you think I don't know who I am and what I've done.<eos> But I do, darling, I do.
Mr. Wolff?<eos> - Chris.<eos> - Hi, Chris, then.<eos> I'm Dana.<eos> Cummings.<eos> Yes. Um...<eos> These are all the files you wanted.<eos> I cross-referenced them by year, and alphabetically, so...<eos> It must have taken you all night.<eos> It sure did.
You'll have a report for me?<eos> When I'm finished, yes.<eos> - Hey, Ed.<eos> - What the...<eos> We're having lemon meringue pie.<eos> Those two bottles of insulin.<eos> You know, I just thought that you would appreciate me treating you like an adult, right?<eos> So, here's what I got.<eos> You administer your own accidental insulin overdose, and just... Die.<eos> But do it with dignity.
And then one day, that break you should have been looking for.<eos> Francis Silverberg, a black money legend.<eos> Cleaned cash from Monte Carlo to Havana to Vegas.<eos> He cooked the books for the Gambino family for 40-plus years.<eos> Until one day, the boss, Big Tony Bazzano, thought maybe the old man's age made him vulnerable to prosecution.<eos> Ordered his son, Little Tony, to kill Francis.<eos> Kid fucked it up.<eos> Francis ran, became a federal informant in return for protective custody.<eos> Could have turned my career around if only I'd listened.<eos> I didn't.
Give me the layout of the home.<eos> Points of entry, corridors, rooms, cover.<eos> Go.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> - What's this...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Sit down in the chair.<eos> You ever see a match-grade round traveling 3,000 feet per second go through a window?<eos> Nobody does.
I do not ask again.<eos> Who did this?<eos> Who did this?<eos> If we are going to heaven when we die, we will return to earth... -... And see what the future holds?<eos> - No.<eos> Do not know if I want to get stuck in the sky and never see the sea and the forest again.<eos> You do not see them if you are in heaven.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Do not know.<eos> But you do not.
Oh, I knew you couldn't.<eos> What?<eos> You set me up to fail?<eos> Why?<eos> If you only do what you can do, you will never be more than you are now.<eos> I don't wanna be more!<eos> I like who I am.<eos> You don't even know who you are.<eos> What do you...?<eos> Of course I do.
- Not for me, for Mr. Vargas.<eos> - Mr. Vargas? You went to all this trouble for Mr. Vargas.<eos> I went to all this trouble to get him off my back.<eos> I promised Decker ten percent, and a great piece of ass if he helped me.<eos> Ten percent?<eos> I don't think he did it for the money, if you know what I mean.<eos> He stole money from us, and then he stole half of it again from you.<eos> I think you got it wrong.<eos> You'll never understand this, Gage, but Decker could have taken it all.<eos> He didn't.
You can't remember anything.<eos> It's probably how you lost your family in the first place!<eos> All right, look, let's just take it down a notch.<eos> Just give me the tag and--<eos> You know something, for a guy with three hearts you're not very nice.<eos> Three hearts?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I don't have three hearts.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - I don't!
Unless I forgot.<eos> No, you didn't forget.<eos> I never told you.<eos> And I'm sorry about that.<eos> But, Dory, because of who you are, you are about to find your parents.<eos> And when you do that, you'll be home.<eos> Dad.<eos> Does this mean we have to say goodbye to Dory?<eos> Yes, Nemo.<eos> We do.
We need every one of you to help us fight the Others.<eos> This isn't summer camp, Zombie.<eos> You're a soldier now.<eos> So we don't wanna lose you.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Take a deep breath.<eos> You all right?<eos> How are we supposed to fight the Others if we don't even know what they are?<eos> Actually, we do.
Do you like it?<eos> - All right, Camille?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I do not know why I cry.<eos> Sometimes one cries, Because one is glad.<eos> Right, Raymond?<eos> Yes,...<eos> Dear Simon, you said the home is for the, Who have no one to love them.<eos> You were wrong. We have not forgotten you.<eos> And the others do not.
Drink something.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> I never agree with Hispanics that lighter runs are better.<eos> Of course, we Cubans align Because of our obsession that the clearer the better, in everything.<eos> Dion, Joseph, my sister, Graciela.<eos> - Very good.<eos> - We have already met.<eos> My mistake.<eos> Of course we know.<eos> Yes, we do.
And the boss will be away.<eos> And Joe, too.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> The difference is that when you are away, Someone will put a bullet through your head.<eos> I will not betray my wife's brother.<eos> I do not want to do this.<eos> Do what?<eos> I do not want to do what I'm forced to do.<eos> I do not force you to do anything.<eos> Yes, it does.
That's awful.<eos> Get behind me, Satan.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> You know, actually we were hoping to do most of the work ourselves.<eos> Oh, is that right?<eos> Well, are you some kind of architect or...<eos> - Well, funnily enough...<eos> - Look at you!<eos> Oh, I guess that you're a man who knows his way around a hammer, too.<eos> I do.
Yeah, I found the key - and I went inside and then... - Dana.<eos> Somebody locked me in.<eos> Nobody would do that.<eos> Who was it, David?<eos> I don't know!<eos> There's no one else here.<eos> I was screaming for help for hours.<eos> Dana, we have been down here the whole time, and we did not hear a thing. Honest to God.<eos> We didn't hear a thing, Mommy.<eos> We didn't.
A lot of us work together.<eos> At MBI?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We have a dart tournament. We have bratwurst.<eos> I make my own home brew, which is my passion.<eos> Good!<eos> How'd you know that Jeff works at MBI?<eos> Jeff must've mentioned it.<eos> Right, Jeff?<eos> - No. No, he didn't.
You don't you think there's something off about them?<eos> I mean, they're so overly accomplished, and stylish and affectionate with one another.<eos> Why would they wanna live here?<eos> Karen, they told you, they wanna settle down.<eos> You know that he was in your den today?<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> So, he can navigate the bazaars of Marrakesh, but he gets "lost upstairs" looking for a bathroom?<eos> Karen, let me tell you something I learned years ago.<eos> When people have to poop, they get embarrassed.<eos> As do I, sometimes.
No, I have the certificate.<eos> I took the...<eos> It's a six-week course.<eos> Yeah, I've taken it.<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's just that I specified that we...<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know, I'm so sorry.<eos> Did I do something wrong?
I don't buy any of your bullshit.<eos> You can make jokes all you want, but you are wasting your life by sitting in this house and watching TV.<eos> Yeah?<eos> And what the fuck are you doing?<eos> It's been three years, Ben.<eos> Should you really be wiping my ass for $9 an hour?<eos> Sounds like you and Trevor had quite a night last night.<eos> - Yeah, sorry about...<eos> - I specifically warned you about the nature of your relationship, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, you did, but...
He'll be fine once he's back on base.<eos> - It's the rest of us that I'm worried about.<eos> - Look.<eos> Push it through, Dallas!<eos> Sergeant, if you had a choice, would you go back?<eos> To Iraq, I mean.<eos> I don't have a choice, do I?<eos> So your question lacks relevance.<eos> - But if you did have a choice.<eos> - But I don't.
- It's the rest of us that I'm worried about.<eos> - Look.<eos> Push it through, Dallas!<eos> Sergeant, if you had a choice, would you go back?<eos> To Iraq, I mean.<eos> I don't have a choice, do I?<eos> So your question lacks relevance.<eos> - But if you did have a choice.<eos> - But I don't.<eos> - But if you did.

So your question lacks relevance.<eos> - But if you did have a choice.<eos> - But I don't.<eos> - But if you did.<eos> - But I don't.<eos> - I'm just saying.<eos> - Shut!<eos> Do you wish we had a choice, is that what you're asking?<eos> Well...<eos> We don't, Sergeant.
"People move on."<eos> People move on.<eos> Everybody supports the troops.<eos> Hell, yeah, "We're so fucking proud of our troops," but when it comes to actual money, then all of a sudden we're stuck in everybody's tight-ass budget.<eos> Talk is cheap, I get that.<eos> Talk is cheap.<eos> But money screams.<eos> This is our country, guys, and I fear for it.<eos> I think we should all fear for it.<eos> I do, Dave.
Sergeant Dime, my offer stands.<eos> Now, it may not be as much as you fellas were hoping for, but from what I hear, it's the only offer you've got.<eos> And I think most people agree something is better than nothing.<eos> "Something" would be nice.<eos> "Something" would be great.<eos> But it's just...<eos> I don't know, sir.<eos> It's just so sad.<eos> We thought you kind of liked us.<eos> But I do.
We had to have faith in each other.<eos> (indistinct remarks)<eos> (gentle rock music)<eos> (indistinct applause)<eos> ♪ Don't let me down<eos> ♪ Don't let me down<eos> ♪ Don't let me down<eos> ♪ Don't let me down<eos> ♪ Nobody ever loved me like she does<eos> ♪ Oh, she does

Hey, you.<eos> Babe!<eos> Guess who's back?<eos> Come here, girl.<eos> There's your mommy.<eos> Come here, girl!<eos> I'm so happy.<eos> I'm gonna kill you.<eos> She... she smells.<eos> Yes, she does.
What would happen then?<eos> Some fines, a few months jail, maybe.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Because you only have to forgive once.<eos> Thank you very much, Sergeant.<eos> Do you think you could find your own way out?<eos> Thank you for the tea, Mrs. Roennfeldt.<eos> Good to see a smile, girlie.<eos> I know you've been sad. You missed your old life.<eos> I do.
I know this war.<eos> - You know...<eos> - Yeah, but tonight's a party...<eos> Communique from your Consul.<eos> Just now.<eos> He says, "Do you have someone for me yet?"<eos> He wants to make an example of someone.<eos> He doesn't care who.<eos> No.<eos> He does.
A rave party, I believe they're called.<eos> Are you familiar with a drug called ecstasy?<eos> I believe they're popular at these parties.<eos> I've heard of it?<eos> Have you ever taken it?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> You're not gonna tell my parents, are you?<eos> They're very worried about you, Cassie.<eos> They care for you deeply.<eos> No they don't.
Spirits?<eos> No, father.<eos> I'll leave that area to men such as yourself.<eos> My focus is on the neurological cause.<eos> And, suppose there is none?<eos> Then we look elsewhere.<eos> Does that elsewhere include the possibility of demonic attack?<eos> Father, if I may be frank, the church's obsession with demons and spirits is what may have planted the idea in Cassie's head to begin with.<eos> -So you don't believe in demons?<eos> -No, father, I don't.
I don't think these boys is reckless.<eos> Damn sure ain't tweakers.<eos> They know exactly what they're doing.<eos> I don't know how you're gonna survive without somebody to outsmart.<eos> You need a hobby, and quick.<eos> How about a horse?<eos> Mary Beth was the rider.<eos> A horse would only remind me of her.<eos> You like to fish.<eos> Not enough to do it every goddamn day.
It was a real piece of shit.<eos> All right. Now, we're getting somewhere.<eos> Oh, that looks like a man who could foreclose on a house.<eos> Excuse me, Natalie.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Banker.<eos> Natalie, I'm gonna have the officer stay with you till your father arrives. - All right?<eos> - Okay. Didn't happen to have your surveillance cameras on this morning, did you?<eos> Of course.<eos> Oh, so you have the robbery on video.<eos> Of course we do.
Like to pay this out in cash or check?<eos> Get some Debbie money.<eos> 4 in cash, rest in check.<eos> Who would you like the check made out to?<eos> Texas Midlands Bank.<eos> Thank you much.<eos> Let's go get a room.<eos> Welcome to the Comanche 66.<eos> Do you have a reservation?<eos> We do not.
No, I'm waitin' for these boys to make a mistake.<eos> So far they ain't, but they will. And they're gonna make it here.<eos> So, just relax.<eos> Enjoy this little town.<eos> Do you wanna live here?<eos> Got an old hardware store that charges twice what Home Depot does, one restaurant with a rattlesnake for a waitress.<eos> I mean, how is anybody supposed to make a living here?<eos> People have made a living here for 150 years.<eos> Well, people lived in caves for 150,000 years, but they don't do it no more.<eos> Well, maybe your people did.
I disarmed them.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You've done well, Doc.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> You don't make it.<eos> To the ice pick, the decanter or the fountain pen.<eos> And, in answer to your question, yes... apart from a few technological upgrades, I'm Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.<eos> The original.<eos> The one I met out there, he thought exactly the same thing.<eos> Of course he did.
Sounds like her.<eos> I did look for her for a while, but who walks out like that?<eos> Maybe I was an asshole?<eos> I think about it.<eos> I think maybe I...<eos> Maybe I was a little too hard on her.<eos> She just... You know, we just weren't a good match.<eos> Doesn't mean you walk out, though.<eos> You don't let a person wonder, even if she hated me.<eos> She didn't.
The decryption and dissemination of which, other than being scientifically impossible, would surely carry punishments of treason that are so severe, the government probably hasn't invented them yet.<eos> They came from the boy.<eos> It's all from the boy.<eos> - Alton Meyer?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Okay, well, we knew that.<eos> He's your son?<eos> Adopted.<eos> Do you know the birth father?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Who says that?<eos> - I do.<eos> We drink to remember, but it seems you drink to forget.<eos> How do you take the measure of a man?<eos> Which part of a man?<eos> Ma, behave.<eos> I said nothing.<eos> The wine was asking.<eos> Ask your heart.<eos> I do.
I know what I must do.<eos> Silver Dart Shi.<eos> She had more courage than any one of us.<eos> Turtle Ma.<eos> I never thought I'd be saying this, but I'm going to miss him.<eos> Pour him a double.<eos> You know, at the Battle of Sichuan, I did hire out to those raiders.<eos> But only because I thought that they were doing the right thing.<eos> I know that.<eos> Always did.
He just got lost.<eos> You saved this entire base, Kirk.<eos> Millions of souls.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It wasn't just me.<eos> Never is.<eos> It's easy to say that the position of Vice Admiral, it's yours.<eos> No one deserves it more.<eos> Vice Admirals don't fly do they?<eos> No. They don't.
Half the time, he don't even know what he be talking about!<eos> - Yeah, Bono know me better than that.<eos> - That's right, I know you. I know you got some Uncle Remus in your blood.<eos> You got more stories than the devil got sinners.<eos> Hell, I done seen him, too. Done talked to the devil.<eos> Nobody wants to be hearing that stuff!<eos> Hey, Pop.<eos> What you come "Hey, Poppin'" me for?<eos> How you doing, Rose?<eos> Mr. Bono, how you doing?
Ain't nothing you can say, Troy.<eos> Ain't no explaining it.<eos> The fella that give me this quarter had a whole mess of 'em!<eos> I'm gonna keep this quarter till it stops shining.<eos> Gabe, go on up front now.<eos> I got some watermelon in the Frigidaire.<eos> Go on. I'll get you a piece.<eos> Say, Rose, you know, I was chasing hellhounds, and them bad men come and get me and take me away.<eos> He come down there and told them they better let me go before he beat them up!<eos> Yeah, he did!
Yeah, I love being spoon-fed in public.<eos> Hello!<eos> We'd like a table for three, please.<eos> Of course. If I could just see your badge.<eos> Sorry?<eos> Oh, well, we've got the pink badges!<eos> I'm sorry, we can only serve Premier Badge holders.<eos> Um, okay, are there any other restaurants?<eos> Well, there's our relaxed dining area, and there are stalls outside.<eos> The Pig in a Poke does a nice hog roast in a bun with apple sauce.
Wait a minute, Clark.<eos> You okay?<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't want to go in yet.<eos> I just want to be a man who has been to a concert with a girl in a red dress.<eos> Just a few minutes more.<eos> So, um... Patrick wants to meet you.<eos> Running man?<eos> Why? I think he wants to know who I'm spending all these late nights with.<eos> My parents do, too.
They wanted me to invite you to my birthday dinner next Thursday. But don't worry, I said you wouldn't want to go.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you hate strangers and you don't like eating in front of people.<eos> Seemed pretty obvious.<eos> I'll come.<eos> If you want me to.<eos> Ah! Lads, welcome.<eos> Bernard Clark.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't...
Are you Claire's daughter?<eos> I thought you were in jail.<eos> Aren't you charming for yelling that out on the street like that.<eos> May I?<eos> No way.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because Mom's at work and you're fresh out of prison.<eos> Okay, white-collar crime doesn't count!<eos> Yes, it does!<eos> No, it does not. It does not.
Because we were all up there, you know, trading our favorite Dana stories.<eos> So it was...<eos> It's positive...<eos> It's good buzz?<eos> There's a lot of good buzz?<eos> Buzzworthy.<eos> Absolutely, yeah.<eos> I mean, they're raving.<eos> - I have to go get coffee.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Um, do you want me to help you out with this?<eos> If she doesn't have anywhere to go, she should stay here.<eos> Honey, she knows plenty of people.<eos> She has plenty of places to stay.<eos> Tito won't return any of my calls.<eos> My sweet Tito.<eos> Fucking Tito.<eos> Mom, we can't let her sleep on the street.<eos> Do you really not have anywhere to go?<eos> No. I don't.
Put it away!<eos> - Whoa. - Put it away.<eos> Hi, Raquel!<eos> It's Rachel!<eos> Go grab your backpack, honey.<eos> We don't need to brush our teeth today.<eos> Our teeth are fine.<eos> You need to wipe some of that off your face.<eos> You know it dries darker?<eos> - No, does it?
I hope he's asleep.<eos> You don't want to be that guy.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm all in.<eos> Dana, I quit.<eos> I'm gonna start my own business, okay?<eos> - I have my own business.<eos> - Yes, she does.
How does that song go again?<eos> They come from the North, right?<eos> Way up there in the mountains where few people have ever been.<eos> But sometimes, a dragon gets lost from its family... and winds up very, very far from home.<eos> They say it lives in these very woods.<eos> That you can hear its roar at night.<eos> They say this, they say that, but, as far as I know... not one soul has ever actually seen this dragon.<eos> Except me.<eos> You saw a dragon?<eos> I sure did.

Jack, he's a monster.<eos> It's not a monster.<eos> It's an animal.<eos> And it's hurt and it's scared.<eos> Grace, wait.<eos> You need help.<eos> You need Pete.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Did you just see that?<eos> I sure did.
I thought that was your job.<eos> Well, yeah, it is my job, but I wasn't doing my job.<eos> I think you've established that.<eos> Bodi isn't you.<eos> He wants to go.<eos> Well, that's just crazy talk.<eos> Who else is gonna guard this place after I'm gone?<eos> From what? The wolves?<eos> Maybe you're sitting up there waiting for something that's never coming back.<eos> What if they do, Fleet?
Good idea.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Pink little ass just bouncing away, saying...<eos> Terry, come getme Terry, come get me no, it's saying...<eos> Mike, crawl up in this Mike, crawl up in this whoa.<eos> What's up, double trouble?<eos> Terry.<eos> Cousin of the bride. Get at me later, we'll make a Terry sandwich.<eos> Don't touch her. She has chlamydia.<eos> - Everybody does.

Hi!<eos> "Hi!<eos> "Hi!<eos> Did you need to take a little breather, too?<eos> No.<eos> Why? Are you?<eos> Well...<eos> You know, you think that every moment is going to feel... Warm and glowy... And absolutely magical.<eos> But, then, some stuff happens.<eos> - Sure does. - Yeah.
Ok.<eos> And what is the wrong decision, - Which I will support?<eos> - OK that...<eos> Is complex.<eos> I'm telling you, when we are with you.<eos> I do not know if she is still alive. My parents may see the corpse.<eos> You will not see her body.<eos> That's part of the plan.<eos> Try to understand, you have to trust the plan.<eos> - I do.
That's part of the plan.<eos> Try to understand, you have to trust the plan.<eos> - I do.<eos> - You trust the plan?<eos> - I trust the plan.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> I trust the man behind the plan and the plan.<eos> OK.<eos> You trust the plan.<eos> I do.
"Because of their experience, they will gradually develop their own thoughts and form their own opinions. "<eos> Ok, I find that stupid, because as soon as she realizes who we are, is they do not want to sleep with us.<eos> Holy Wichshand.<eos> The accept all major cards.<eos> Huffy, give me your credit card.<eos> No, no way.<eos> My father has made it very clear.<eos> The is only for emergencies.<eos> Huffy, consider your virginity quiet as an emergency.<eos> I do.
No!<eos> - What?<eos> No! That was no answer.<eos> - Run, Shaqobi!<eos> That was not the answer!<eos> - Do not hide again in the dryer!<eos> - I'll eat you alive!<eos> - Crap!<eos> - I can reprogram.<eos> - I do it.
We are cut from the same wood.<eos> I want you to bring them back.<eos> Good? That's the end of the bedtime story.<eos> So you have nothing to worry about.<eos> Bring it tomorrow morning back, ok? In order.<eos> Come on, lie down, sleep now.<eos> I spread yourself to yet.<eos> So. And now go to sleep.<eos> That has never been my dad.<eos> That he did constantly.
Let me show you how a real detective handles this.<eos> Damn.<eos> A.J., look, man.<eos> All we trying to do is have a little conversation about your boy Troy in Atlanta.<eos> Troy who?<eos> You just encrypted a drive for Troy.<eos> Troy? I-It doesn't ring a bell.<eos> I don't know any Troy.<eos> It don't ring a bell?<eos> No, it does not.
So Troy must be his Atlanta boy.<eos> Yes!<eos> That's a big operation. Catching Pope would get us Troy for sure.<eos> To sum up, I'm his cyber dark arts guy.<eos> I hack into his competition. I install his systems. I launder his money.<eos> You just admitted to about four or five crimes right there.<eos> That's Fifth Amendment. A couple of days ago, I may have taken some money from his account and put it into mine.<eos> - You "may have"?<eos> - I didn't think he'd notice.<eos> - Apparently, he did.
How did y'all get that money?<eos> Ellie stole it.<eos> I didn't steal anything.<eos> I sold something.<eos> That's the thing, see?<eos> You're just helping out a guy.<eos> A guy who went to the Rock for stealing something.<eos> We're three of a kind.<eos> What do you mean, my wife picked her up?<eos> She did.
- Sound Machine, all right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, Beuter.<eos> I mean, Billy.<eos> Look, man, I got a little lady downstairs who maybe wants to come up here and check out my album collection, you know?<eos> How about that?<eos> Hey, Jacob, didn't Coach Gordan say this afternoon that we weren't supposed to have girls upstairs?<eos> He said something about that, didn't he?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he did.
I'm telling you.<eos> Yeah, man, I must've wasted, like, $200 in quarters on this bitch last summer, just getting reamed by these little fuckers.<eos> You can't win.<eos> Once they get up on you, you're fucked.<eos> Sounds of amateurs who have not yet mastered the gap method.<eos> - What the fuck is the gap method?<eos> - You're looking at it, Plum.<eos> Like you were saying, most people lose at this point not because they get shot, but because they get overrun.<eos> But I discovered that they actually don't shoot you from the absolute front row.<eos> - Shit, they don't?
Make it work for you.<eos> Hey, screwdriver!<eos> It's not the writing of the Magna fucking Carta!<eos> That's a book.<eos> Who drinks a screwdriver, anyway?<eos> I drink a fucking screwdriver!<eos> Everybody I know drinks a fucking screwdriver.<eos> You know who drinks a screwdriver?<eos> - My little sister drinks a screwdriver too.<eos> - Really? Does she?
Who am I speaking with?<eos> - My name is Edward, sir.<eos> - Edward.<eos> Where are you from, Edward?<eos> - Jakarta, Indonesia, sir.<eos> - Jakarta'.!<eos> Indonesia.<eos> Edward, what would you think... of me renting a car through the hotel?<eos> Do you have an international driver's license?<eos> No, I don't.
You are using too many words.<eos> Hey, do you like reggae?<eos> So, where'd you get the booze, huh?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I know a hangover when I see one.<eos> - Where did you get it?<eos> - I would rather not say.<eos> What, you think you might endanger your source?<eos> - Oh, you think that's funny?<eos> - I do, yeah.
And then later in business school... Schwinn was one of our case studies.<eos> Interesting period. Interesting period.<eos> This way.<eos> Schwinns were made in the US... the Raleighs in England, the Italian bikes, French.<eos> For a time, you had real international competition.<eos> You were choosing between very different products... with different heritages, sensibilities, techniques.<eos> - Well, that's gone now.<eos> - What happened, in your view?<eos> - I thought you studied our case.<eos> - I did.
- Like what?<eos> Is this about the money?<eos> - Of course it's about the money.<eos> All right, okay, fine, you know, I lost my credit card, okay?<eos> And they put a block on it.<eos> And I realized that you might come up short, so I went to the bank and got you some cash.<eos> Here you go.<eos> That's why I came round today, to make sure you and the kids were okay.<eos> Em, come on, you didn't think I would just, like, leave you hanging, did you?<eos> You did, didn't you?
Now what?<eos> Hatch!<eos> Shuttle deploying in... 5... 4...3... 2... 1.<eos> Welcome, guest.<eos> Hatch do you read me?<eos> Let's log in.<eos> Warning!<eos> Preliminary readings indicate a native toxic atmosphere.<eos> Prolonged exposure might cause paralysis or death.<eos> -How we doing?
It's what he does.<eos> Or did he fail to mention that to you?<eos> Propaganda.<eos> The truth.<eos> I'm your only way out.<eos> I'll give you a fair trial!<eos> No one gets that.<eos> Anything from the silver seat?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I did not.
I think I can freeze what's left of the implant, Jerico.<eos> You can be normal.<eos> But we have to do this now, before it's gone.<eos> You turn around, come back here and see me.<eos> What about Jillian?<eos> There's too many lives at stake, Jerico.<eos> We're all gonna die.<eos> Leave them.<eos> They don't matter.<eos> They do to me.
You said something about that.<eos> You were talking in the cab but mostly incoherent But I did hear the word mask.<eos> Anything else?<eos> The bodies, the blood and fire and hell.<eos> And there's a woman.<eos> The woman, she seemed...<eos> Seek and find.<eos> Uh. Well, seemed so dangerous.<eos> No, you got to have somebody we should call.<eos> I do?
It was standing next to a little boy's bed.<eos> It was just gently touching his cheek and then it stopped.<eos> And it looked right at me.<eos> Of course, my mom and the nurses did not believe me, but I knew it was real.<eos> Look, I know how it is.<eos> I know what it's like to lose your friends because you're different.<eos> But I also know that one person can change everything.<eos> And you just have to open up to them.<eos> How did you know you could trust the people you opened up to?<eos> I didn't.
Catherine!<eos> - Reginald's returned. - He's here?<eos> He's just gone to find your father.<eos> - It's not... - No, no.<eos> No, the most happy news.<eos> - Our fears were in vain.<eos> - What?<eos> - The engagement's off. - How?<eos> Well, Lady Susan broke it off herself.<eos> She did?
Excuse me, are you well?<eos> Sorry, we so set our hearts on Frederica's return. I understand completely.<eos> She's become an agreeable companion.<eos> Even her tendency to extreme quiet I've grown to find rather soothing.<eos> But there is one factor that concerns me.<eos> - Does she look quite well? - Yes.<eos> That was your impression?<eos> London's vaporous air is not, I think, healthy for her.<eos> - Does she not seem pale?<eos> - She does.
This is Eric's brother.<eos> Here.<eos> This is Eric's fee for his fight.<eos> He wanted you to have this.<eos> If anything happened to him.<eos> And of course... it did.<eos> - You're making a joke.<eos> - Do I look like I'm laughing?<eos> - You trained my brother Muay Thai?<eos> - Yes, I did.
- I think we can do it.<eos> It worked!<eos> Move!<eos> Go!<eos> What?<eos> Did you train him to do this?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have no idea how he learned this.<eos> - Did that just happen?<eos> - Yeah, it did!
- Hi, Valerie! - I'm Deacon Tim McDonald, welcome!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Welcome, Valerie.<eos> I'm Miss Edna Clark;<eos> Everybody calls me Miss Edna.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - I never will be the same... - I couldn't believe it.<eos> If I wasn't actually there, I wouldn't think it happened.<eos> And then, suddenly, he came out of nowhere.<eos> - Who did?
We can't all be held accountable for our adolescent personas.<eos> Can we, Magicolio?<eos> Magicolio, that was 15 years ago.<eos> Don't get me wrong, I love magic.<eos> Like you, and many others who, I suppose, were not getting any sex in high school, I dabbled with it.<eos> But, unlike you, I was able to transition upward towards actual magic.<eos> Science, you may have heard it called.<eos> So, would you like to know, my friends, just how I got you here?<eos> We know how you did it.<eos> No, you don't.
And last but not least, one whip with two...<eos> Shrunken heads.<eos> Oh, shit, just put down "whip." One whip.<eos> What?<eos> - All right. Pull over.<eos> - This should be it.<eos> The house of the man who shot the last murderer.<eos> One Jeremy ruckner.<eos> What, do you live in your car? Uh-huh.<eos> Course you do.
- No.<eos> - You're on in ten minutes. Right.<eos> - You should.<eos> Wado-Ryu would suit you 'cause you're wiry.<eos> So what you lack in power, you make up for in range and flexibility.<eos> My problem is I'm literally all power.<eos> So Shotokan.<eos> One punch.<eos> So it's like, "Oi, mate, I don't want any trouble."<eos> "Well, I do." "Oh, sorry."
You okay?<eos> I don't think I am.<eos> You're a great mom.<eos> That kid up there... he needs a great mom.<eos> You need a kid.<eos> It's a perfect match.<eos> We don't need anything else.<eos> I know that you think you do.<eos> And God knows there's a big part of me it feels the same.<eos> But we don't.
Thank you for your time. And I'm sorry for your loss, as well.<eos> Do you really want to bet your life that an 8 year old won't have another nightmare?<eos> - It's not his fault.<eos> - It'd be a mercy.<eos> Someone has to do it.<eos> Do you know anything about his birth mother?<eos> There's nothing in the file.<eos> Only that she died.<eos> I assume the way my wife did.<eos> The way your husband did.
Oh no.<eos> Hey, come back!<eos> The rocks!<eos> For the love of God, man!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You were right.<eos> Was I?<eos> Yes.<eos> I didn't know who I was before... but I do now.<eos> I do now.
Why was Lemi K untouchable?<eos> It's a party. Lemi K, he gets the whole thing on video.<eos> Including Jr.'s underage girlfriend seizing up and dying from some bad crystal.<eos> So Lemi had him on the short leash, huh?<eos> Yeah, well it cuts both ways.<eos> Lemi does shit for him too.<eos> Like murdering my wife?<eos> Listen, I had nothing to do with that.<eos> Neither did my partner.<eos> Well you do now.
Testudo!<eos> Hold this line!<eos> Forward!<eos> Forward!<eos> Tribune, we have Barabbas!<eos> Bring him.<eos> I know how this ends.<eos> Then tell Yahweh you are coming, courtesy of Mars.<eos> It must pain you to know that the one true God chooses us over you.<eos> Not today, he didn't.
We are followers.<eos> We follow to find out.<eos> I think he is preparing us.<eos> For what?<eos> Down.<eos> Pilate will not let this rest.<eos> I bring danger to you all.<eos> They have a tracker.<eos> They can't know we're up here.<eos> They already do.
Good job, too.<eos> - We are alive because of him.<eos> There are a lot of people who have a grudge against Hank Searles!<eos> I mean, he laid off half this town!<eos> He's the reason it's so fucked up here!<eos> Guys, just chill, alright?<eos> Look, I don't have a grudge against him, okay?<eos> My parents didn't work for him.<eos> Hm.<eos> Yours did, Amanda.
Come on.<eos> Sully!<eos> Lorrie, I love you.<eos> What the hell's the matter with you?<eos> The on board count, 150 passengers, three flight attendants and two pilots, one of whom, the senior pilot, drew on all of his experience and skill, which combined with near-miraculous good luck and a result that was, frankly, astounding.<eos> There were some non-critical injuries, but everyone, everyone, survived.<eos> The first pictures of US Airways Flight 1549 reveal...<eos> You think that you're gonna die.<eos> That's what you think.<eos> And then, miraculously, you don't.
Okay, well, let's get into how you calculated all those parameters.<eos> There was no time for calculating.<eos> I had to rely on my experience of managing the altitude and speed of thousands of flights over four decades.<eos> You're saying you didn't do any...<eos> I eyeballed it.<eos> You eyeballed it?<eos> Yes.<eos> The best chance those passengers had was on that river.<eos> And I'd bet my life on it.<eos> In fact, I did.
Thank you, Larry.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Lorrie.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you before the hearing.<eos> Sweetheart, what happened?<eos> I realized just now, for the first time, that there were...<eos> There were 155 people on that plane and you were one of them.<eos> We almost lost you.<eos> Yeah, but you didn't.
Multiple airports, runways, two successful landings.<eos> We are simply mimicking what the computer already told us.<eos> A lot of toes were stepped on in order to set this up for today.<eos> And frankly, I really don't know what you gentlemen plan to gain by it.<eos> Can we get serious now?<eos> Captain?<eos> We've all heard about the computer simulations And now we are watching actual sims.<eos> But I can't quite believe you still have not taken into account the human factor.<eos> Human piloted simulations showed that you could make it back to the airport.<eos> No, they don't.
Ray of sunshine.<eos> Shethoughtit wascorny asshit.<eos> But it stuck.<eos> IfI 'dhaveknown, Iwouldhavehelpedher.<eos> Youknowthat,don 'tyou ?<eos> I mean, she was always so bright.<eos> Sohappy.<eos> To think she was carrying around all that pain, all that unhappiness every day.<eos> I should've seen it.<eos> But I didn't.
Thank you very much, Lynne.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Benjamin, thank you for coming.<eos> We're grateful you could make it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know, the funny thing is, James always hated funerals.<eos> Yeah, don't we all?
Move faster.<eos> Come on, Aysel!<eos> Aysel?<eos> They've come to enjoy the taste of blood... even if it's their own.<eos> Aysel has always dreamed of conquering man... and restoring the Kingdom.<eos> It's why he believes you're here.<eos> Why do you believe you're here?<eos> To protect your people.<eos> The Dominion will never find us.<eos> I did.
Hey!<eos> What's that, another son?<eos> Don't be daft.<eos> That's our grandson, gangnam style.<eos> Hiya.<eos> Hi, dad.<eos> And this here is Luke.<eos> We call him that because he's got leukemia.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He doesn't really.
Stopped on our way through.<eos> - School is where? - Iowa.<eos> Hawkeyes?<eos> - You and Connor ever take any drugs?<eos> Conner never... and I'm pregnant.<eos> I mean, I think I am.<eos> That's why Conner... he went into the store.<eos> It's okay. Have some water.<eos> How did Conner know the store clerk?<eos> He didn't.
- You got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, I think there's someone we need to talk to.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Look at this place.<eos> Well, she wanted that box so she must know something about it.<eos> Which is one more thing than we do.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - I was wondering when you'd come.<eos> Miss DeGracie, we need your help.<eos> Yes, you do.
You winking at my girl?<eos> Your girl?<eos> I guess you do look old enough to be her father.<eos> Excuse me, gentlemen... is there something you'd like to share with the rest of the class?<eos> Can I please go to the bathroom?<eos> I think there's something seriously wrong with my eyes.<eos> Fine, Scott.<eos> And afterwards... why don't you stop by the principal's office and explain to him... that you're disrupting class again?<eos> I trust you know the way.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
No metal.<eos> Some guys at the factory said they saw something today.<eos> Something that didn't add up.<eos> Put your weapons away.<eos> You've been a good citizen, Henryk...<eos> A good neighbor... a good worker.<eos> I want to believe that's who you are.<eos> It is.<eos> But nobody in this town really knows you.<eos> Yes you do.
Just checking on you.<eos> I'm good. Playing Pac-Man.<eos> You sure you weren't watching this?<eos> This news comes at a time when the world is celebrating 10 years of peace... between mutants and mankind.<eos> You're going after him, aren't you?<eos> You wanted me to get out of the house more, right?<eos> I can't stop you.<eos> Nobody can.<eos> But trust me, this won't end well.<eos> Nothing does with him.
- Just like we negotiated.<eos> - Well?<eos> - It's done.<eos> Make the call.<eos> Is that you?<eos> No, sir, it's not me.<eos> Who is this?<eos> I have a witness who can exonerate me.<eos> But he has to live first.<eos> Why don't you...
- Kill him!<eos> - Let him live!<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> They need an answer.<eos> This is an execution. No.<eos> This is a trial.<eos> And I yield, to the wishes of the people.<eos> It is time, that we break from the past!<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> Neither did your sheep.
We have to go.<eos> We're going back to Chicago, we shouldn't ever have left.<eos> - No, we have to wait.<eos> - Yeah, we've been waiting.<eos> Okay, David is not the person that you think he is.<eos> Four, you know nothing about David.<eos> You've no idea what we've been working up here.<eos> What have you been working on?<eos> Do you have any idea what is going on out there?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
That was brave, Conor.<eos> You finally said it.<eos> Why didn't it kill me?<eos> I deserve punishment.<eos> I deserve the worst.<eos> Do you?<eos> I've known forever that she wasn't going to make it.<eos> She'd keep telling me she was getting better all the time because that's what I wanted to hear.<eos> And I believed her.<eos> Except I didn't.
And, oh, there would never be any doubt.<eos> The name Buster Moon would go down in entertainment history.<eos> And I should know. Because I am Buster...<eos> Moon!<eos> Open this door!<eos> Good morning, Mr. Moon.<eos> Miss Crawly.<eos> What, uh... What's going on?<eos> You got a lot of animals waiting to see you, Mr. Moon.<eos> I do?
- Yeah!<eos> The show? Guys, I'm done.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> What do you mean, "done"?<eos> Come on!<eos> Didn't you see this?<eos> Huh? Look, it says I'm a "danger to society."<eos> "A deluded, washed-up charlatan "who never had a hit in his career."<eos> Oh, come on, you don't believe all that?<eos> Yeah. I do.
What do you mean, "done"?<eos> Come on!<eos> Didn't you see this?<eos> Huh? Look, it says I'm a "danger to society."<eos> "A deluded, washed-up charlatan "who never had a hit in his career."<eos> Oh, come on, you don't believe all that?<eos> Yeah. I do.<eos> Listen.<eos> You're not the only one who lost something here.<eos> - We all did.
Zoe, I saw that!<eos> Stop it!<eos> And, Leo, that is disgusting.<eos> Well, John, I've covered many disasters for this network, but this is sure to...<eos> Oh, they're about to start.<eos> Okay, guys, listen up!<eos> Look, I gotta tell you, um, there's not much of an audience out there tonight.<eos> But you know what?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It really doesn't.
But this ain't the way I want it.<eos> I wanna bed you proper.<eos> But you're acting more like... an adventuress than a lady.<eos> You been with one of them?<eos> Been with a couple in my day, I reckon.<eos> But you gotta remember, I'm old.<eos> You're not old.<eos> For a lawbreaker I'm ancient.<eos> What was it like with the painted ladies?<eos> Did they do it good?
I quit the drink.<eos> We drove the demon out.<eos> So now the demon's clean gone?<eos> And you repent?<eos> So all's good?<eos> Good with God?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Christ forgives.<eos> He forgives.<eos> Yes, he does, mister,
We drove the demon out.<eos> So now the demon's clean gone?<eos> And you repent?<eos> So all's good?<eos> Good with God?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Christ forgives.<eos> He forgives.<eos> Yes, he does, mister,<eos> Yes, he does!
So I have one more question.<eos> If the...the devil if he's gone from this house well, then, that must've been you getting your dirty ass licked and your tiny prick slopped on by my bride-to-be last week,<eos> and the week before that and the week before that!<eos> Hey, you shush!<eos> I might just pump you full of lead on account of you knowin' it was goin' on all these years.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> You see...<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> You see Christ forgives.<eos> He does.
Or we could cross over and we could look for 'em.<eos> No, I think you oughta get on back to your family.<eos> I'm gonna poke around Mesilla a little bit, get a hot bath, you know, kinda linger, see if I can't...<eos> Hey, hey, I'll stay.<eos> I know you will.<eos> I'm well-upped, though.<eos> You cut on out, get back to your family.<eos> You're the boss.<eos> At least we got two of them,<eos> Yeah, we did.
Task force will decide who brings in Barnes.<eos> Don't bother, Miss.<eos> Romanoff.<eos> I'll kill him myself.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Are you alright?<eos> Ah, yeah, thanks.<eos> I got lucky.<eos> I know how much Barnes mean to you.<eos> I really do.
He never mentioned that.<eos> Maybe only a thousand times.<eos> God, I hated you.<eos> I don't mean to make things difficult.<eos> I know.<eos> Because you're a very polite person.<eos> If I see a situation pointed south, I can't ignore it.<eos> - Sometimes I wish I could.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> No, I don't. Sometimes...
Enough.<eos> - He said he wanted to see an empire fall.<eos> - With these guys he can do it.<eos> They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight, infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize,<eos> They can take a whole country down in 1 night.<eos> You'd never see them coming.<eos> This would be a lot easier if we could...<eos> If we call Tony.<eos> - Oh, he won't believe us.<eos> - Even if he did.
And you and Mike were friends.<eos> Mostly when we were kids.<eos> But your families were friendly.<eos> Alexander.<eos> Uh, yes, I guess we were all friends.<eos> The defendant, Mike.<eos> Your father testified that he and his dad, that their relationship went downhill.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And you saw that.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Yep.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You can't catch him, and if you do, look what happens. Look what happened to my family.<eos> - Jeremy, Jeremy, I, uh...<eos> - You can't kill him, Harry.<eos> This is what he does.<eos> This is what he's always done.<eos> And then he does it all again.<eos> Jeremy, I understand you're frustrated.<eos> I really do.
but that makes us lose the gift of eternal life.<eos> I can already hear you asking:<eos> "What mistake?"<eos> it's not given to us to know but it is because of that mistake that human beings become mortal.<eos> Of course you'll probably raise the objection that no one has ever lived long enough to demonstrate the reliability of that theory and that's true.<eos> But it's also true that nobody has ever been an exception to it.<eos> Logic, logic, logic.<eos> I understood what my mistake was.<eos> Not everybody reaches that.<eos> But I did.
Yeah.<eos> Do you remember your mom at all?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> I did always feel like she wanted me back... for us to be a family again.<eos> Maybe it's just... wishful thinking.<eos> I don't know, I...<eos> I do feel like the answers are in that house.<eos> I do too.<eos> You wanna go back?<eos> I do.
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.<eos> Sorry. - Marine!<eos> Make a hole, Baker.<eos> Move out!<eos> Why are we stopping?<eos> The lead vehicle bottomed out.<eos> Okay!<eos> Heads on a swivel!<eos> Didn't we come this way?<eos> We most surely did.
Look, Geri, I don't know what Tucker has been telling you.<eos> He said that you're upset about the air time you're getting.<eos> That's just wrong, because this is not about me.<eos> My frustration is with our priorities and what's best for the network.<eos> Isn't deciding what's best for the network my job?<eos> I'm just saying, as journalists, we have an obligation to this story.<eos> And Afghanistan should be on our air more, period.<eos> With the resources we have over there, Afghanistan should definitely be on our air more.<eos> But the problem is, as much as everyone loves the troops, they don't actually want to watch them on the news anymore.<eos> They just don't.
No, thank you.<eos> I just need a moment of your time.<eos> We still friends, Sadiq?<eos> Well, that is up to you, Kim.<eos> Because you once told me that nothing happens here that you don't know about.<eos> So you must know about my friend Iain MacKelpie getting kidnapped.<eos> I did hear about this, yes.<eos> Yeah, well, everybody heard about it, but a powerful man such as yourself must actually know something.<eos> Or your friend Pacha Khan knows something.<eos> - Or his friend does.
I'm not looking for D.<eos> You on the dollies again?<eos> Do you see a welcome sign over my head?<eos> Go away, Baz.<eos> Brass monkeys, man.<eos> Where are you crashing tonight?<eos> No, seriously. You've seen D?<eos> Seriously, I'm on the script.<eos> I mean it this time.<eos> Yeah, who doesn't?
- Sorry.<eos> - He will. Just playing hard to get.<eos> - Don't panic, by the way.<eos> This isn't a you-know-what tree.<eos> No, it's a lamp tree.<eos> Taste like turkey?<eos> - Not even vaguely.<eos> -It does!<eos> - Tastes like rubber.<eos> - No, it doesn't!
And you can tell who the human slave is because the demon marks them.<eos> Look.<eos> I bet Mary had that mark.<eos> When you knock, the first knock raises the demon the second summons the human slave and the only way that the human slave can be free of the demon is if they kill themselves or if they trick someone else into replacing them by forcing them to do something truly, truly evil.<eos> Enough.<eos> - I thought you wanted to help me.<eos> - I do, sweetie, but this is insane.<eos> What is it?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
Tell me the truth.<eos> You didn't tell me the truth.<eos> You said that the kids hounded that woman.<eos> But it was you.<eos> You blamed her for the killings.<eos> You kept at her until she couldn't take it anymore.<eos> She killed herself.<eos> She got what she deserved.<eos> Did she?<eos> Did she really?
I just stopped by because I need to borrow $20.<eos> Dad, come on, I need it.<eos> Angie, you got 20 bucks?<eos> Yeah, I got 20.<eos> Yo, Rashad, you got a dub on you?<eos> Yes, sir. What up, son?<eos> Does everybody in here that's working...<eos> What up, Dad?<eos> -got at least $20 in their pocket or purse?<eos> Yeah, I do.

And that's not the case?<eos> When I finish work every night, I run home and I get in the shower, and I wash the smell of that baby off of me as fast as I can.<eos> Ah.<eos> When you woke up this morning, I went and I brought you back to bed with me.<eos> And when I was feeding you, we heard Daddy singing from the kitchen, didn't we?<eos> Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you<eos> Happy birthday, dear Anna<eos> Happy birthday to you<eos> Daddy came upstairs with a beautiful breakfast that he made for Mommy, didn't he?<eos> Yes, he did.
I picked everything in that house.<eos> I picked everything.<eos> I picked the dining table, the kitchen table.<eos> I wonder if she knows that I fucked Tom on the same table that her baby eats at.<eos> I just wanna tell her.<eos> I wish I could tell her.<eos> I picked everything in that house.<eos> I fucking picked everything in that house.<eos> I could never find the words to describe how I felt when I read that e-mail.<eos> But this morning, I did.

You fucking killed her!<eos> I know it!<eos> Un-fucking-believable!<eos> Listen to me. Megan got into his car that night.<eos> You think I don't remember.<eos> You thought I blacked out.<eos> I saw you.<eos> Why did Megan get in your car? Did Megan get in your car?<eos> No!<eos> Yes, she did!
Lethergo. You're gonna hurt her.<eos> Change her here. Okay. I'll change her.<eos> You're gonna hurt her.<eos> - 911, what's your...<eos> What's your emergency?<eos> No. Stay. Stay.<eos> Do you need a drink? No.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> All those things that you said I did...<eos> Those terrible things, I didn't do any of them.
That was in the box your grandma sent.<eos> Just a hot rapper from the Bronx around '93 freestyling.<eos> - Who? - Me.<eos> That's funny?<eos> My own blood laughing at me.<eos> I should take it back.<eos> You used to rap?<eos> Man, don't sleep on your old man, son.<eos> I had sick flow with this freestyle shit.<eos> Probably still do.
No, I knew this would happen.<eos> The witch told me years ago.<eos> She promised me three children and she promised me they'd die.<eos> "And gold their shrouds."<eos> Everything she said came true.<eos> You couldn't have stopped it.<eos> It's prophecy.<eos> It's fate.<eos> - You don't believe that.<eos> - Of course I do.
- Yes, sir.<eos> I come here all the time.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Oh, it's all right.<eos> How you doing?<eos> What's this?<eos> Glad you're putting it to use.<eos> - Well, I'm trying.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So how we doing?
Oh, in this town, I think you'll find a judge that will be able to do that.<eos> I don't understand why you're doing this.<eos> 'Cause we got something he wants.<eos> Yeah, in exchange for a settlement, we sign a confidentiality, then we return the evidence to Mr. Denning, including the files that were "hypothetically"<eos> taken from his computer.<eos> No risk of criminal prosecution.<eos> Then we're done.<eos> Ciao.<eos> Did he just buy back the evidence?<eos> Yes, he did, and he did it legally.
She was testing me to see if I would bring the money for her.<eos> But she didn't live long enough to see what I would do.<eos> Pity.<eos> Kind of sad that she involved you, too.<eos> So why did you send that guy to come intimidate me at the club?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I have a net worth of $8.7 billion.<eos> Do I look like a man who would hire street thugs to do his dirty work?<eos> I never wanted any of this.<eos> Of course you didn't.
She was high... and she slapped me.<eos> And I was so mad at her... and you.<eos> The guy in the church, he knew.<eos> In the back of your mind, I thought that you knew, too.<eos> I pushed her.<eos> She fell.<eos> Her head hit the table and she didn't get up.<eos> I could have helped her, but I didn't help her because I thought that if she...<eos> If her heart stopped beating, then mine would stop hurting.<eos> It kind of did.
They set me up!<eos> You scared the shit out of me!<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> We're doing inspection today, seeing if you're wearing any underwear.<eos> Would you mind pulling those pants down for me and see what kind of underwear you're wearing?<eos> What's up?<eos> What did you say?<eos> You called me an asshole?<eos> - No, I'm calling... - Why would you call me an asshole?<eos> - I... I never do that.
- Do it tonight.<eos> The U.S. marshals service is taking them into protective custody tomorrow.<eos> The first name will arrive by text.<eos> When it's done, confirm the hit.<eos> I'll give you the next name.<eos> And use this phone only, in case anything happens- given the gravity of the situation, you might want to consider tempering that arrogance of yours.<eos> - These targets are your friends, Grady.<eos> - Nope, these targets are my targets.<eos> - I'm guesses that sounded better in your head.<eos> - Yes, it did.
He made your dream.<eos> - Did he?<eos> - Did he?<eos> Did he?<eos> Queen's garden, rear window, please.<eos> Why have you and your giant come to see me?<eos> I think you would remember that, Your Majesty, if the mixing went well.<eos> Yes, I remember.<eos> You have a plan. You need me.<eos> Yes, we do.
I don't have a fucking daughter!<eos> I fucking hate kids!<eos> What the fuck does it matter, man?<eos> You win. You fucking coward!<eos> You didn't have the balls to make the call, did you?<eos> No!<eos> You give up your responsibility to the little girl.<eos> And you came crawling down here with your dick in your fucking hand to grovel like a dog for mercy!<eos> Fuck you.<eos> I don't do mercy!
Why do I drink it, then?<eos> One of those unresolved mysteries of life.<eos> How's my crew?<eos> Or, how are my crew?<eos> Whichever is grammatically correct.<eos> Well, sir, the Webbs, um, are just checked in.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - And the other thing?<eos> The other thing.<eos> As you can guess, I imagine, Reynard wants more money.<eos> Of course he does.
I wonder how in the hell it got out here?<eos> Maybe it fell from a spaceship.<eos> Is it true they can sting you even when they're dead?<eos> No, I think when they're dead, they're dead.<eos> They're immortal, though.<eos> What?<eos> Jellyfish, they're immortal.<eos> Bob told me.<eos> Just because Bob says something doesn't mean it's true.<eos> Yeah, it does.
Us.<eos> You and me and...<eos> The girls.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I just wasn't ready.<eos> I know you think you're hot shit ever since you moved to New York, but don't be an asshole, okay?<eos> This guy's got Mom's life in his hands.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I don't think I'm hot shit.<eos> Sure you do.
Okay.<eos> Okay, so...<eos> You kissed her?<eos> No, no, no, she kissed me.<eos> No.<eos> Major difference.<eos> Major.<eos> I just thought that you said you didn't have feelings for her anymore, and she just had a kid.<eos> I don't.<eos> She did.
Johnny, it's terrifying.<eos> It's not that bad.<eos> - How much do you owe?<eos> - No, not that, no.<eos> It's terrifying to find out this late in your life what you should have done.<eos> We still have time.<eos> I tried, you know.<eos> I did try.<eos> You got to know that.<eos> - I do.
You fought with him?<eos> I caught him crouched in the bushes, watching your house.<eos> When I approached, he took off.<eos> You saw his face?<eos> No, he was wearing a mask, like a ski mask.<eos> Like a stalker on a TV show.<eos> He got away.<eos> - Pat, go in with her.<eos> - No, don't bother.<eos> - Do it anyway.
- Ladies...<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> - Sure?<eos> - Really.<eos> Curse him! Damn him!<eos> Close the book, ring the bell, blow out the candle.<eos> What's that?<eos> Call yourself a Catholic?<eos> You don't know the excommunication rite?<eos> And you do?
- ...how long?<eos> - Decades.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I gather you have a seat on the council.<eos> I could not be more proud.<eos> It's a shame that your return is not under more festive circumstances.<eos> It is said that the Western Coven was utterly destroyed.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> It's a blessing you escaped with your life.<eos> Well, many did not.
We explore, like, America.<eos> We party.<eos> A whole bunch of shit.<eos> It's cool.<eos> Hey, yo, Jake!<eos> - I think they want you.<eos> - Everybody wants me.<eos> - Let's go, man.<eos> - I don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- Just give me a second.<eos> Okay, continue.<eos> Catch!<eos> Ready.<eos> Slow down, I can't see the notch.<eos> Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Catch... I think.<eos> You think?<eos> It's behind the other two rings, and I can barely see it, but I heard something latch, did you hear it?<eos> No, I didn't.
Let's open it up for questions, shall we?<eos> Coach! Coach!<eos> Julia King from CAN.<eos> What can you tell us about your feelings on Thadland?<eos> Have you been?<eos> And can you comment on Thad Castle's open bashing of the late Walt Disney?<eos> He's called him, and I quote,<eos> "A short, anti-Semite... "with less imagination in his whole "Jew-hating body than I have in the tip of my pee-hole."<eos> He said "pee-hole?"<eos> - He did.
Theia Voula said to remember I was a girlfriend before I was a mother.<eos> Yeah, you were my girlfriend.<eos> Hey, remember when we were dating, you wouldn't let me drop you off in front of the house 'cause you didn't want your parents to see me?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't want you to see the house.<eos> How could I miss it?<eos> I used to park right here.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I remember those good-night kisses.<eos> Oh, you do, huh?
We've got enough trouble tonight.<eos> The curfew's to protect people.<eos> From what?<eos> They should riot.<eos> I'm sorry, officer.<eos> We-- we're both sorry.<eos> I am not fucking sorry.<eos> She's 16.<eos> You got any at home, you'll understand.<eos> I don't.
Women in trauma, women who have been ill, it can help them to become a new woman.<eos> But I want the old Dawn.<eos> I want my wife and I want Merry.<eos> We're not talking about Merry.<eos> But as for Dawn, what if you were to go along with her, support her in this, in the trip to Switzerland, the operation?<eos> It could help the both of you to put the past behind you.<eos> I don't want to put the past behind.<eos> The past is Merry.<eos> There's no way I want to put that behind.<eos> But Dawn does.
A matter of principle.<eos> Can you tell me anything else?<eos> Did you get reposted?<eos> -No, I resigned the CIA.<eos> So what does that mean? What do we do<eos> -I don't know.<eos> I'll figure it out, but listen...<eos> This is a good thing.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I do.
Did you think about going to journalists then?<eos> No, that wouldn't have occurred to me back then.<eos> I thought that the system will self correct.<eos> The President will keep the promise that got him elected.<eos> That's actually when I started reading about you and your films.<eos> It was in Glenn's blog, you were being detained in airports for hours? 37 times.<eos> Investigating your own country's wars.<eos> That's why I'm going back to Berlin to edit.<eos> You can trust me with this<eos> -I do.
- Those are Greer's orders.<eos> - We are not leaving him.<eos> - You came back for us.<eos> Yes?<eos> You chose to go to the compound and work.<eos> You could've joined one of those gangs, but you didn't, because you wanted to help.<eos> Say it.<eos> You wanted to help.<eos> You want a second chance, right?<eos> Yeah. I do.
We need a little break from each other every now and then.<eos> It's the only way it works with us.<eos> Hey, where did you disappear to?<eos> Jóhann was just showing me around.<eos> You've got a beautiful home.<eos> I'm really glad he likes you.<eos> He typically doesn't like any of my friends.<eos> What about me?<eos> Oh, he loves you.<eos> But then, so does everybody.
I cried.<eos> Within, like, the first minute.<eos> - You both cried.<eos> - Did you?<eos> If I had to pick my favorite action, it'd be Saving Private Ryan.<eos> - Classic.<eos> - It's so visceral.<eos> A lot of guys like action films, but I do too.<eos> Mitch, you love Saving Private Ryan.<eos> - He does?
I think you look hip and handsome, like you belong.<eos> - In a Robin Thicke video.<eos> - A little bit.<eos> Well, if you're gonna be seen with me, this is what you're wearing.<eos> You just get a couple different color T-shirts.<eos> You rotate them around.<eos> It'll be like a whole new outfit.<eos> - The chain looks great on you.<eos> - I...<eos> It does.
He's out of town for a few weeks.<eos> But I am a handy gal, so I can figure it out.<eos> Well, I should probably take her in to monitor her.<eos> What?<eos> To the clinic? - Now?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But it's 2:00 am.<eos> It's 3:00 am.<eos> I thought you just said she was okay. Hang on.<eos> I did.
- Yeah.<eos> Well, I'm borrowing his ship today.<eos> Yeah, it's new. Stephanie:<eos> You seem awfully focused.<eos> I'm driving, so I can't drink.<eos> She's making me nervous as hell.<eos> Stephanie: Woe is you.<eos> Hey, y'all, this is not a middle school dance.<eos> Go bother somebody else.<eos> Hey, you doing all right?
If you're looking for the restroom, back down the stairs.<eos> We're looking for Amelia.<eos> I'm telling you, I saw her, Mr. March.<eos> I didn't imagine it.<eos> I saw my Misty alive.<eos> Mrs. Glenn, be reasonable.<eos> This is a high-profile case.<eos> Your niece is a very famous actress, and the head medical examiner lD'd her himself.<eos> I saw her through the front window.<eos> - You didn't.
- I'm sorry, it doesn't matter?<eos> You just shot at us. I think it matters.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I made a film.<eos> I made a film with Dean, my boyfriend.<eos> And the idea was that we were gonna, you know, like make this experimental film, like an artistic film.<eos> - Porno film.<eos> -It's not a porno.<eos> Look, do you even know who my mother is?<eos> Yes, we do.
- That's a long time.<eos> - It's a long time.<eos> We gonna go swimming?<eos> - I'll race you to the island!<eos> You know Toby Brown?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Greasy Toby, the guy with the OCD?<eos> Yeah. That and ADD.<eos> He tried to kiss me.<eos> - He did?
- and we didn't know what to do... - Stop talkin'.<eos> Yes.<eos> Look, man, I already told you, makin' a report.<eos> That guy's not gonna come back and bother you.<eos> I'll bet you scared him off pretty good, huh?<eos> Besides...<eos> I won't let him ruin the fun.<eos> Thanks 'cause... my friend's inside and she's pretty upset about the whole thing.<eos> She wants to go home.<eos> We all do.
- Oh, shit! - What.<eos> Just don't move, don't turn around, just keep doing what you're doing.<eos> I can hear it from here.<eos> Fuck!<eos> It didn't even flinch.<eos> There's something seriously wrong with this dog.<eos> - Just quick scope the fucker. - What?<eos> Just shoot it.<eos> - Just keep going. - Really.<eos> Yeah, just do it!
She said she was my momma, too. That I was her son from another mother.<eos> - She say...<eos> - You the brother, like no other, yes.<eos> I feel...<eos> I feel tired.<eos> Really, really tired.<eos> Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.<eos> I do believe the first kill came rather quickly this year.<eos> I'm rather disappointed.<eos> The first one always does.
-They might as well have left a note.<eos> -They did leave a note.<eos> And then there's the matter of the other broken window.<eos> -What other broken window?<eos> -Precisely!<eos> The only broken window is the one that Watson and I entered through, yet, prior to that, we distinctly heard the sound of...<eos> -What did you just say? -Sorry?<eos> About a note, what did you just say?<eos> -I said the murderer did leave a note.<eos> -No, they didn't.
Amelia was always good at that.<eos> I think if we had ship counselors, they'd talk to her instead of the counselors.<eos> She always managed to stay positive.<eos> Even in the darkest time.<eos> To Lieutenant Yarris.<eos> It's funny you mention that, Amelia being so positive...<eos> First time we had lunch...<eos> It was in her quarters.<eos> We were both new to the ship, and she fit in so well, but...<eos> I didn't.
- Well, you better get on that, Mr. Fix-it.<eos> Hey, I got your message this morning.<eos> I was in the neighborhood showing a property down the street, figured I'd swing by.<eos> Thank you, you didn't have to do that, but... a phone call would've been good, but thank you.<eos> No problem.<eos> What would you like to discuss about the house?<eos> Well, my kids found this very old chest in the attic.<eos> Yes.<eos> I believe I mentioned that the remains of the house were part of the purchase.<eos> Yes, you did.
When was the last time you fed?<eos> This morning after we came back.<eos> Hold still.<eos> - Does it hurt?<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Mommy says Huntington's a gift from God.<eos> The pain reminds us how precious life is.<eos> Your granny said the same thing to your mom when she was your age.<eos> Did Granny die of Huntington's?<eos> Yeah, she did.
On July 4th, 2017, at 1300 hours, we uploaded the folder containing the virus.<eos> By 1301, we had lost control of our entire operating bay.<eos> All the screens from our main concourse to our counter facilities went black then turned to a page of scrolling numbers.<eos> Everything was changed pass codes, platforms, locations, everything.<eos> - The rest is history.<eos> - So what went wrong?<eos> No way to know for sure but if I had to guess...<eos> They gave it a mind of its own, and it decided to use it.<eos> You see, we never opened the source file.<eos> So then who did?
- You will never...<eos> - Shut the fuck up.<eos> You don't get to talk.<eos> - Don't even think about it.<eos> - We've been here before.<eos> Andreas?<eos> Just tell me where she is.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - You think I'm playing?<eos> - No, I don't.
! - What's my name?<eos> ! What's my name? !<eos> - I don't know!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We saved the city!<eos> - I-I saved the city.<eos> - You saved the city!<eos> - I saved the city, man.<eos> - You fuckin' saved the city!<eos> - I did it! I did it!
- I'm taking you out.<eos> - Huh? What's going on?<eos> You know I called you when I was sick.<eos> Yeah, come on, I was busy.<eos> - Busy doing what, huh?<eos> Busy? - Yeah.<eos> I'm losing my house because of you.<eos> I can take care of that.<eos> How are you gonna take care of that, Vic, huh?<eos> How you gonna do it?
That's why you get 200,000 people surrendering to 60,000.<eos> That's the difference.<eos> Now, the thing is, politicians, they don't understand tactics.<eos> And soldiers, they don't understand strategy.<eos> But Caesar, he understood both.<eos> Julius Caesar in the corner.<eos> He's read it all.<eos> He knows every battle ever fought.<eos> - Does he know about the real thing?<eos> - None of us do.
We're wide open.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do we have shovels?<eos> We do.<eos> Have the men up for drill at 0600.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Dr O'Brien, how was your flight?<eos> Very pleasant, thank you, General.<eos> We have a lot to talk about.<eos> We do.
- There you go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> To the rest of our lives.<eos> Together.<eos> I love you, John.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I guess they found nature.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Yes, they did.
My name is Chet.<eos> - You're in Todd's frat? - Yeah.<eos> And on the rugby team?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay. Well, I've got to go.<eos> Okay, um, well, I'll see you around.<eos> Ahem! I think I'm gonna be sick.<eos> So you have the hots for him.<eos> What?<eos> No, I don't.
I finished the online problems for the entire semester three weeks ago.<eos> All right, apple, then I wasn't talking to you.<eos> How about the, uh, the readings?<eos> You need any help with those?<eos> My parents published the books. Yes, that's right.<eos> You are Mccreighton-hill.<eos> The girl who got into Greene because of her parents.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I, uh, I don't buy that.<eos> Everyone else does.
It's been forever.<eos> I would love that.<eos> - Me too.<eos> - I'll, um...<eos> - I'll see you on the panel.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> See you up there.<eos> I'm wondering, for each of you, what's that thing that really makes you... want to get up in the morning?<eos> Well, for me, I guess, the simplest answer is... I like money.<eos> I do.
Michael, we cannot.<eos> Hey, Compliance, are you listening?<eos> The only wall we're crossing here is the wall of love.<eos> Oh, Mich...<eos> Never a dull moment here in Compliance.<eos> That... That's his company phone?<eos> Isn't that crossing the wall?<eos> Well, technically there's nothing criminal here.<eos> So Remson doesn't have a policy prohibiting... this kind of romantic relationship between two employees?<eos> Some banks do, but nope.
Yeah.<eos> - Remember my friend Marco?<eos> Oh, from Stanford, right?<eos> The tech blogger guy?<eos> Yeah, he writes about encryption and secrecy... whisper-funds, all that kind of spy shit.<eos> He seemed to think that Cachet was gonna go well.<eos> We hope so.<eos> Yeah, what about you?<eos> Think they're onto something?<eos> I do.
We have looked at the comparables, Ed, and...<eos> You said 34 to 36 in your pitch.<eos> You'll leave tens of millions of dollars on the table.<eos> We can get at least 35.<eos> This is a balancing act.<eos> Raising money for your company... while still promising our investors a deal for coming on board...<eos> Look, you begged me for this IPO.<eos> Do you want me to call Channing Trust?<eos> I don't actually remember begging.<eos> Does anybody else?
- Uh, Dr. Sobel.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Dr. Sobel.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Sobel.<eos> - He told you.<eos> And that's how you got the edge.<eos> - You have to call me.<eos> - Yeah, I sure do.
So, am I done?<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> We own you.<eos> Hello?<eos> Marin, it's Naomi Bishop.<eos> Do you understand what's happening here?<eos> Cachet can sue you.<eos> No, they said they would take care of that.<eos> Who?<eos> Who did?
That's right.<eos> Did that outrage you?<eos> No.<eos> I understood why she felt like that.<eos> You understood it but filed a countersuit against her.<eos> Did that help diffuse her outrage?<eos> No.<eos> It didn't.<eos> How did two people like this live under one roof?<eos> They don't.
You know what time Surrogate's Court opens?<eos> 8:00 a.m.<eos> And when was Andrea's funeral?<eos> That Wednesday.<eos> So, two days before you buried her, you applied for her trust fund. Okay.<eos> I think I've got the time line straight.<eos> Just one more question.<eos> When Andrea asked you to move out, do you know if she changed the locks after that?<eos> I don't, because I haven't been back there.<eos> She didn't.
This is my subpoena, only pretend it has a "C" on it.<eos> You should feel okay.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I do.<eos> Then you're a worse liar than the stepfather.<eos> Any case, there's nothing else to do.<eos> We're out of witnesses.<eos> We're done.<eos> I want to call Naz.<eos> No, you don't.
No, he doesn't.<eos> To the jury he does.<eos> He gets in that box, they'll expect him to prove his innocence.<eos> Any everything else we've presented goes out the window.<eos> You mean everything I've presented.<eos> You're killing me, and that's fine, but don't kill him.<eos> Go home and write and your closing argument.<eos> You think you can handle it?<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I do.
Did you bring it?<eos> You better say yes.<eos> You did it?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Where's the rest of it?<eos> I got you.<eos> Okay?<eos> Officer.<eos> In the short time you and Andrea were together, did you develop any feelings towards her?<eos> I did.
So, I touched her to wake her. I felt in my hand something wet.<eos> I turned on the lamp next to the bed and saw her.<eos> The blood, the wounds, and, uh...<eos> She was dead.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you?<eos> I panicked and I ran.<eos> I wish I hadn't done that.<eos> I'm ashamed that I did that.<eos> But I did.
How many times have you had sex, with women or men?<eos> Once before, with a girl.<eos> Only once before?<eos> And you don't remember anything about this second time?<eos> There were a lot of drugs.<eos> Oh, we've heard.<eos> A lot of foreplay, too?<eos> No.<eos> She didn't want a lot of that.<eos> She didn't.
And keep doing it?<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> You are, aren't you?<eos> We got another connection.<eos> Friend of yours and my last job before this fucking retirement.<eos> Andrea.<eos> Tragic death.<eos> Nice girl by all accounts.<eos> I mean, she had her personal problems, but who doesn't?<eos> You do.
What happened out there?<eos> What happened to the trick?<eos> Conner, don't worry.<eos> Nobody saw anything.<eos> I wish they had seen something.<eos> Now, there's 10,000 people that think I got no dick.<eos> Wait.<eos> You guys know I have a dick, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You do. You do.
You tell me you don't have any security guards?<eos> Units at the helm.<eos> No, stop!<eos> The fuck is wrong with you?<eos> !<eos> Trying to take a chopper off in the middle of downtown, are you fucking crazy? !<eos> You motherfucker!<eos> Hubert got away!<eos> We don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah. We do.
I'm not gonna take anything, I just need to turn the money in.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> I don't know how much my wife knows about the man that I've become.<eos> I've done some really fucked up things, man.<eos> Really bad things.<eos> But it ends here.<eos> That's not how this is gonna go down, mims.<eos> I need to do it for her.<eos> This has nothing to do with her.<eos> Maybe it does.
After the battle at Culloden, a few Jacobite soldiers, all seriously wounded, took refuge in an old house... for two days, then they were all taken out to be shot, but one of them, a Fraser of the Master of Lovat's regiment, escaped execution.<eos> There were a lot of Frasers on the field that day.<eos> But... only five Fraser officers, and four of them have their names memorialized on a plaque in the church in Beauly, so... we know for certain that they were killed.<eos> Who was the fifth?<eos> James Fraser.<eos> My father.<eos> Jamie.<eos> He didn't die at Culloden?<eos> Well, he meant to die, but...<eos> He didn't.
I called for you.<eos> What happened?<eos> - I found it.<eos> - Found what?<eos> - The wolf.<eos> - Where'd you see it?<eos> In the woods.<eos> Something ate it.<eos> - Should have left it alone.<eos> - I did.
He didn't mean... Hey.<eos> I went easy on you before.<eos> But now...<eos> You're not gonna pass through the restricted zone on your way home, "bosmain." We can't go around.<eos> Not enough fuel!<eos> We die for sure.<eos> That's your problem, not mine.<eos> How do you know what's waiting at those coordinates?<eos> - I don't.<eos> - Neither does Fred Johnson.
The day before his 18th birthday, I took him out to mend a fence, and I told him to get as far away from this place as he could.<eos> And that if he didn't go, then I would, because I couldn't stand to watch what we were doing to him anymore.<eos> You were right to open the cage.<eos> I get a... Lovely message from him every month.<eos> Or two from some ship or other, deep out in the system.<eos> Jimmy still hasn't found his place, but at least he's free.<eos> Guys, this is taking way too long.<eos> It's composite titanium.<eos> If we'd started an hour ago... - Who said that you could talk?<eos> - I did.
We're runnin' out of ammo.<eos> James Holden.<eos> Shit just follow you around, don't it kid?<eos> Are you a cop?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Hey, thanks for the assist.<eos> Now who the hell are you?<eos> Anybody else know you were coming here?<eos> No. No, I don't think so.<eos> They do now.
- No.<eos> I mean, she's in a vulnerable state.<eos> Yeah, but is she, like, breakdown material?<eos> I can't see how she can stand this kind of pressure much longer, if that's what you mean.<eos> I'd like to hear what you know about Louis' fall, the version Natalie told you.<eos> Uh, why?<eos> I thought that since you had a certain... friendship with her, that you might have some insight that would help us.<eos> I don't think I do.<eos> Did you know that Peter Drax isn't Louis' biological father?<eos> I did.
All these organizations really truly have an interest in the safety of the sport, and hopefully, as our findings come out, it will be useful to the sport, not only of MMA but our society at large,<eos> It all worked on being knocked out.<eos> When you see somebody pow!<eos> He's knocked out, drops on the floor. Their eyes roll in the back of their head and they don't wake up for two minutes. Everybody sees it, "Wow!"<eos> Cheering in the stands and everybody getting up.<eos> And it's a good fight, and they're shaking the guy's hand, and everything's going on.<eos> And really the concern that everybody don't see is the damage being done to this individual.<eos> And with every applause, there's just as much downward spiral.<eos> And so is the UFC and Bellator and all the rest of them want it out?<eos> Hell, no. Of course they don't.
I did.<eos> I see we're all ready to go.<eos> Murtagh, please try not to insult too many people tonight.<eos> Are you... mad, woman?<eos> I can see every inch of you, right down to your third rib.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> Christ.<eos> I can see right down to your navel.<eos> Surely you don't mean to go out in public like this.<eos> I most certainly do.
Can you, like, put all of that away, please?<eos> You can hitch a ride with me.<eos> You going to take a quick shower?<eos> Uh, sometimes a lady needs more than a quick shower.<eos> I hear you.<eos> All right.<eos> [toilet flushes]<eos> She's as crooked as a dog's hind legs, and you know it.<eos> And Principal Wayne knows it.<eos> I sure as hell do.
It's your wife.<eos> Well, she's, uh, very blonde.<eos> I've asked you to come here because I'm, uh, faced with a very difficult decision.<eos> Join the club.<eos> I notice you've been taking a... very unusual approach with your students.<eos> Well, Principal Wayne, some of the kids are assholes, and I have to treat them accordingly.<eos> The language you use could be argued as inappropriate to some.<eos> Some of them deserve it.<eos> You feel it's working?<eos> In fact, I do.
Dressed up, you look like a lady too.<eos> How did your mum die?<eos> That she was so lucky to have you before dying.<eos> That she had no regrets.<eos> Is this the companionship they write about in books?<eos> Men are disgusting.<eos> How can they be so single-minded?<eos> What's on my mind?<eos> You don't really believe that I crave your body?<eos> You do!
Who do you think he left the boat to?<eos> I'm sure he left you everything.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Which... part are you having trouble with?<eos> Well, I can't be his guardian.<eos> Well...<eos> Uh... I mean I can't.<eos> Well, naturally I assumed that Joe had discussed all this with you.<eos> No.<eos> He didn't.
It's not that.<eos> It's just the logistics.<eos> I just got to work it all out, I swear. How?<eos> By sending me to Wonkatonka, Minnesota with Uncle Donny?<eos> Minnetonka, Minnesota. Okay, Minnetonka, Minnesota.<eos> Same difference.<eos> What about my mother?<eos> The judge would never let that happen.<eos> And anyway, no one knows where she is.<eos> I do.
- Do you know...<eos> - This is...<eos> We're going live in just a few seconds.<eos> - Right this way.<eos> - Keep swiping.<eos> And turn around.<eos> Here's the camera.<eos> Do not go anywhere.<eos> - You don't know this young man?<eos> - No, I don't.
Already?<eos> Steady, darling.<eos> It's not lunchtime yet.<eos> Be nice to me. I've just lost my husband.<eos> I can't believe you're buying the house.<eos> I've always loved this place.<eos> I know you have.<eos> More than Felix anyway.<eos> I hope you realise what you're taking on.<eos> Of course he does.
Come on!<eos> Rose!<eos> Rose?<eos> Here!<eos> There we go.<eos> Craig was right.<eos> I should have done more. I should have tried.<eos> You did... nothing wrong.<eos> No. He deserves to know the truth.<eos> You both do.
Is that man-speak for you've done all the work?<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> Thank you for returning pink Ted.<eos> Who has now gone missing again.<eos> I'm beginning to suspect a vendetta.<eos> Maybe this is the first one of our cases destined to go unsolved?<eos> Unsolved?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I'm guessing you have a dog?<eos> Yes, we do.
How's the feet?<eos> Embarrassing.<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> How's the investigation?<eos> Clearer by the minute.<eos> Oh, I doubt that.<eos> I wanna talk to the boy again.<eos> And I wanna live forever.<eos> I had to ask.<eos> You did.

Truth is all the women secretly resent my mother.<eos> And why wouldn't they?<eos> All of them dressed in black.<eos> Refusing to have any more children.<eos> Like they all agreed that the first woman to wear color again was the worst mother in town.<eos> Well...<eos> My mother wears pink.<eos> I was eleven years old when I decided to marry Soraya.<eos> And every day for six years I prayed for the courage to talk to her.<eos> But I never did.
May I?<eos> # No storm can shake #<eos> # My inmost calm #<eos> # While to that rock I'm clinging #<eos> # For love is Lord of heaven and earth #<eos> # How can I keep from singing? #<eos> The body of Christ.<eos> - Hey, Father. - Hey.<eos> She seems better today.<eos> Does she?
- Huh?<eos> I'm Chandra Kapoor. I'm working with Ms. Crowe on the Khan case. - Okay.<eos> Let's go see her.<eos> - Um, actually, she's asked me to tell you she's sorry, but she's left for the day.<eos> - Chandra, huh?<eos> Your boss is too much. I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not sure what that means. You do.<eos> She took you with her when she stole my client.<eos> - Tell me I'm wrong. - She didn't steal anyone, Mr. Stone.<eos> She did.
See, the reason it feels like silk is because from the day it's born, they keep it in a dark crate, so small they can't even turn around.<eos> And it stays there, half-blind in the dark, drinking baby formula, waiting to die.<eos> There are some bad people in here, but I could protect you.<eos> Nasir, do you want my protection?<eos> Or do you prefer dead in the shower, with your brains bashed in, guts on the floor?<eos> It's up to you.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He offered to help me in here.<eos> - And you said?<eos> - I didn't.
- He's not here.<eos> - Angel, listen to me.<eos> You call him.<eos> You tell him he does this and the Minister becomes a martyr.<eos> I cannot have my presidency built on murder. You see that.<eos> He will not leave this to the voters.<eos> He does not believe in the American system.<eos> Angel, believe in me.<eos> I can make this happen.<eos> We do.
Arthur, this is not the time.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'll come back.<eos> No, I won't!<eos> I've been doing that all my life, saying I'll come back when I wanted to stay, staying when I wanted to go.<eos> Rose, that night at the summer ball, I wanted to kiss you very, very much.<eos> I should have kissed you, like this.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I had feelings for you then, rose.<eos> I still do.
- But he got that silliness from you and it makes him such a better comedian.<eos> Every Aspie parent seems to fear their kid hates them or their kid is unhappy, and it's 'cause their kid isn't communicating very much with them.<eos> That's part of the autism is you're self-centered, so you really want to stay within you and not get out and interact with the world, which includes your parents, unfortunately.<eos> Is it overwhelming for you to ride the train like this when you have somewhere important to go?<eos> - Back and forth.<eos> - Yeah, that makes sense.<eos> - Like just back and forth is overwhelming, but if I were just riding the train coming to a point, it would be fine.<eos> I mean, transferring is not an issue, although I do always get overwhelmed in rush hour 'cause I'm bumping into people.<eos> - It's good you aren't in any Chris Tucker films.<eos> Doing really good, dude.
We need light. Quick, turn around!<eos> What a surprise, finding you down here!<eos> - Going for a ride?<eos> - No.<eos> We're leaving your stinky island.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> But that's not going to happen.<eos> I decide who leaves.<eos> And I decide...<eos> - that nobody does.
- I'm working on it.<eos> - Are you?<eos> 'Cause it sure as shit don't look like you're working on anything here.<eos> Well, you should spend more time here.<eos> - It's a process.<eos> - I'm not fuckin' around.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Do you need to know or does your husband?<eos> You know I hate it when you call her that.<eos> Course I do.
- I told you I only found that out... - You must know something.<eos> At this point you know more than I do.<eos> My brother wasn't the only one.<eos> Fifty-three people have gone missing from that property in the last 125 years.<eos> The appraiser said the cops searched the place top to bottom.<eos> Yeah, well, that's what this town keeps on telling itself.<eos> You think my uncle did it?<eos> I think it's something worse.<eos> You think it's haunted.<eos> - You don't?
And they can take possession of many things such as inanimate objects.<eos> But like angels, they exist in a supernatural realm and like humans they have free will.<eos> Free will.<eos> So they're behind what's happening at the house?<eos> And I'm stuck with them?<eos> - I hate this goddamn house.<eos> - I don't blame you.<eos> At least we know what we're dealing with.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Nothing does.
- Because we're not eight anymore.<eos> - But you're still the same girl.<eos> - Ha, that's where you're damn wrong.<eos> You know, Dave is kind of a loser.<eos> He's got like the IQ of a fat squirrel.<eos> - Do you have a problem with him?<eos> - Yeah, he shoved me inside of my own locker freshman year.<eos> - That never happened.<eos> - Maybe it did, maybe it didn't.<eos> - It didn't.

Now, here's the money now.<eos> I mean, you can count it.<eos> Thank you, man.<eos> I appreciate it. I really do.<eos> Leah. We got to go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Here, now, we got to go.<eos> He was fine.<eos> That nigga's a maniac, yo. He took my cousin's fucking eye out.<eos> No, he didn't.
Too old.<eos> Hmm. But, enough!<eos> Enough! Enough!<eos> No more Hollywood talk.<eos> I'm so sick of this bullshit.<eos> - All I care about is truth.<eos> Or dare.<eos> Truth or dare!<eos> Yo, that chorus do kick in nice, though.<eos> It does, don't it?
No, no!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just have a lot of personality.<eos> I don't know what to tell you, brother.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> First of all, I don't care if they like Shark Tank more than Techtonic.<eos> They're murderers!<eos> All right.<eos> Second of all, no, they don't!
Yeah, I saw the artistic director after... And he mentioned this ABC show that's staffing...<eos> And he knows the show-runner.<eos> So I'm gonna send in a spec.<eos> That's great!<eos> You already have that one you can send.<eos> I mean, it needs a lot of work, but...<eos> Where's your dad?<eos> He's standing downstairs.<eos> Do you have any wine?<eos> Uh, yeah, yeah, we do.
My wife will have gone to her mother's. Yes! Now I think of it, she mentioned she might visit.<eos> Where is her mother?<eos> The Isle of Dogs.<eos> It would be better if her mother came here.<eos> Is it something that comes to all mothers?<eos> That sacred bond between mother and child?<eos> I have no doubts. I only fear she does.<eos> Hard work makes a mother.<eos> We like to think something magical happens at birth.<eos> And, for, some it does.
There you go.<eos> Almost there, sweetheart.<eos> Still in one piece, kids?<eos> She's being sick!<eos> That's it.<eos> That's wonderful, Daisy.<eos> Come on, you lovebirds.<eos> Save your courting... Till we've got you safely in that ambulance.<eos> Baby's turning, Daisy, it knows just what to do.<eos> Like you do.
Little girls don't drink.<eos> Disneyland?<eos> How lucky are you guys?<eos> - What are you guys gonna ride?<eos> - Jumbo.<eos> Dumbo, not Jumbo.<eos> Dumbo.<eos> Em, did you thank Mommy?<eos> Say thank you?<eos> - Yes, we did. - Yes.
Rabid bears?<eos> Highlanders.<eos> Much the same thing.<eos> Hmm. You mentioned a drink?<eos> I'll take the gray one.<eos> You take the other.<eos> So, now we're traitors, murderers, and horse thieves.<eos> Tell me, does it ever occur to you that taking Claire to wife might not ha' been the wisest thing you ever did?<eos> - No.<eos> - Hmm. It doesn't.
Right here.<eos> Unsaid.<eos> Forever.<eos> All because you couldn't keep yer arse on a bloody horse.<eos> I can't believe you encouraged that wee slip of a girl to... to become his wife.<eos> I encouraged her to become his widow.<eos> Black Jack will die tomorrow at the Battle of Culloden.<eos> But if we succeed tonight, there will be no battle.<eos> Then perhaps his death will come about by some other means.<eos> And if it doesn't?
He took me under his wing.<eos> He taught me how to police for real.<eos> I have no idea what he saw in me back then, but he has had my front and my back.<eos> If he's clean or not... I wanna be the one to bring him in, ask him his side of the story.<eos> I owe him that much.<eos> We're wasting our time.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Somebody's in there.<eos> - No... no way Scarfe got past us.<eos> - Well, somebody did.
Next to the dishwashing station.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> Look what Luke Cage did to your cousin.<eos> Nice sweatshirt.<eos> You box now?<eos> What I do is more like CrossFit.<eos> Always full of surprises.<eos> And I hate that.<eos> I don't know shit about you.<eos> Nobody does.
- The system is not your enemy.<eos> - Really?<eos> How's the system been treating you lately?<eos> I should kill Cottonmouth.<eos> But I won't.<eos> I want him to suffer.<eos> He should know what it feels like when your life is over, while everyone else's life goes on as if you don't exist.<eos> You sound like you're speaking from experience.<eos> You should trust me, Misty.<eos> Like Pop did.
And that, in your lap, represents a chance to change your life... and that of your whole family.<eos> That's power.<eos> Did Luke really do all of that?<eos> You never really know what anyone is capable of.<eos> Go on, get some rest.<eos> You'll come back to the club in a few days when it opens.<eos> You think it worked?<eos> She's a good girl.<eos> She won't fold.<eos> What if she does?
Why does he get a pass?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Diamondback is after everything and everyone that I've ever cared about.<eos> So it stops with me.<eos> I am my brother's keeper... whether I like it or not.<eos> It's on me.<eos> This stops now! This stops now!<eos> This stops now! This stops now!<eos> This stops now!<eos> Yes, it does. Yes, it does.
- Yeah.<eos> What number are you calling me from?<eos> A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS.<eos> I need to see you.<eos> - Come into the precinct.<eos> - No. No.<eos> You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer and got me out of there.<eos> You didn't wanna talk to me before.<eos> What makes you trust me now?<eos> Because Luke Cage does.
Let's just say they fell off the back of a truck.<eos> Okay, when?<eos> Who's this?<eos> First name Law, last name Yer.<eos> Must be pretty damn connected to get a lawyer and not even know who she is.<eos> Membership has its privileges.<eos> He sprung you?<eos> You think this is funny, don't you?<eos> You got this all figured out, huh?<eos> No... actually, I don't.
There's food in there, too.<eos> You can't leave me in here!<eos> There's baby diapers in here, man!<eos> Come on!<eos> Looks like you downgraded.<eos> I liked the club better.<eos> I'm a man who needs his space.<eos> Space is a good thing.<eos> Especially when you come to kill a man.<eos> Someone did your boy Zip and his two homies.
Cheers, guys.<eos> We meant to go to Ecuador.<eos> We got as far as an apartment on top of a restaurant across the road from the radio station.<eos> - You don't like it?<eos> - Oh, no, it's lovely.<eos> That's not what I meant. I...<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> It's just... you know.<eos> You know Kim and Kanye?<eos> No. No, I don't.
And you made the playing video games, reading comics a bad thing, as well.<eos> - It's not what every woman likes in a man.<eos> - Good.<eos> Because I don't want...<eos> I don't like her to want me anymore. Because I don't want her anymore.<eos> As the world waits and worries about our two journalists in Ecuador, the whole station joins me in thinking of Ian Finch, - whose birthday it is today.<eos> - Happy birthday.<eos> - This is Claire Maddox... - I'd forgotten.<eos> Claire remembered.<eos> She always does.
- Okay.<eos> You ready?<eos> If you see Ren, tell him that I loved him too.<eos> I will.<eos> Good luck.<eos> - What happened to the girl? - She was going to kill you.<eos> - I had to take her.<eos> She disappeared.<eos> Did she say anything?<eos> Yeah, she did.
What good does that do me if I don't remember any of it?<eos> Whether you remember this or not, your father used to say that he was amazed by your abilities.<eos> He said you were capable of far more than he ever said.<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> More?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But when the time comes, you'll know what to do.<eos> Have faith in yourself.<eos> I have faith in you.<eos> And so did your father.
Well, you have to, because we have two kids.<eos> Perry, you have two kids.<eos> I have three.<eos> What? What you talking about?<eos> You talking about me?<eos> Dad?<eos> - Dad!<eos> - Dad!<eos> Hey! What's up, homie?<eos> How you doing?
Is it today?<eos> Promise me.<eos> We have plenty of time.<eos> 8:25.<eos> Where's Curda?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Valčík, you take this street behind me.<eos> We have some sun, so take this.<eos> If he approaches without an armed escort, then use it to signal.<eos> And if he does?
And speaking of a bad bitch... stop fucking with my wife around here.<eos> No, for real. Stop jacking off to her...<eos> - stop watching her.<eos> - Who told you?<eos> They snitching on me?<eos> You've been running around here... with your little dinkle out and stuff.<eos> - Cut it out!<eos> - Did she tell you she don't like you... 'cause you look like Lionel Richie?<eos> I don't look like no fucking Lionel Richie.<eos> - Yes, you do.
You lied to us.<eos> Look, we're gonna talk about that later, all right?<eos> - When?<eos> - Don't start that shit right now.<eos> - I can't stand you.<eos> - Stop that shit right now.<eos> You can't hide forever!<eos> - Look, they purging', all right?<eos> - She killed somebody.<eos> - I did!
- No.<eos> No, that's okay.<eos> No. It's not okay.<eos> It's not okay with you.<eos> You know, I liked your seriousness.<eos> I liked your maturity at dinner, or what I took to be maturity.<eos> I made a joke about it, but I liked your intensity.<eos> I never met anyone so intense before.<eos> I liked your looks, Marcus.<eos> I still do.
Morning, Mr. Church.<eos> Mr. Church?<eos> Mr. Church?<eos> Hey, I'm just resting.<eos> Just resting.<eos> Mama, where's Mr. Church?<eos> He's sleeping.<eos> Sleeping?<eos> He never sleeps.<eos> Of course he does, baby.
Amberle was secretly corresponding with her.<eos> I found them hidden in her room.<eos> Why would the princess need to write in secret to her aunt?<eos> We had a falling out many years ago.<eos> She fell in love with a Human.<eos> And when she asked for my blessing, I refused.<eos> Because she didn't love an Elf?<eos> Because she loved you, Allanon.<eos> I thought she understood that there was no future for us.<eos> Well, evidently, she didn't.
Kyle didn't like 'em, so he took them down.<eos> He didn't like 'em?<eos> I mean, who doesn't like custom built-in wood shelves?<eos> Jesus. I mean... half of us build the world, the other half destroy it.<eos> What the hell happened here?<eos> Kyle had an accident.<eos> He had an accident with door trim?<eos> How do you even do that?<eos> Why didn't he fix it?<eos> He did.
A reveal?<eos> Yeah, 'cause it reveals some of the piece below it.<eos> You know, if it were even, it would be called flush, because it's flush.<eos> Flush.<eos> And if it protrudes, like this one, then it's called proud.<eos> Proud.<eos> Yeah, 'cause it's, uh, sticking out, like it's boastful, right?<eos> You see, uh, carpentry is only the illusion of perfection... but we can come close.<eos> They say God lives in the details.<eos> He does?
Love, or whatever it was."<eos> With Gustl I had my first deeply-felt relationship.<eos> One of which a 20-year old believes it will last a lifetime.<eos> We spent all our spare time together.<eos> We belonged to each other.<eos> The film ball at the Palasthotel am Zoo was a big yearly event.<eos> Gustl always looked forward to.<eos> That ball was far more important to me than anything happening in Germany.<eos> You're probably going to ask me now when I first met Hitler and Goebbels.<eos> Everyone does.
How long I been here?<eos> Four days.<eos> The man I brought in here.<eos> Gundersen?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Captain sent a few riders out to that homestead you told us about.<eos> Circuit judge come out from Salt Lake.<eos> We had us a trial yesterday.<eos> He hand down a judgment?<eos> He did.
Besides, it ain't what the Heavenly Father wants for us.<eos> Come on now.<eos> Have some more of that chicken.<eos> Looks real good.<eos> Father disagreed with the Prophet on Thor Gundersen.<eos> Got him cast out.<eos> And us with him.<eos> I know.<eos> So, where'd you say you're headed?<eos> I didn't.
What happen?<eos> Long story.<eos> But that's all over now.<eos> It's dangerous to be doing this.<eos> I know.<eos> I gave you boys damn near a month to finish this thing.<eos> Well, looky here, just when I was starting to get lonesome.<eos> Jim.<eos> - Heard you found your family.<eos> - I did.
- That's enough.<eos> - Get to it, Major.<eos> - We have to call it off.<eos> - No chance. I ain't risking the rope to walk away with empty pockets.<eos> There's no money, John.<eos> Campbell won't pay.<eos> John Campbell cannot afford the political fallout of my death. - He will pay.<eos> - He's brought the cavalry onto us.<eos> And they have Indian trackers, who are going to find us.<eos> - And when they do...

Johnny Shea killed Mr. Delaney and kidnapped Durant.<eos> McGinnes turned him in. Why?<eos> No loyalty amongst rats.<eos> Maggie,<eos> Durant told you he wired for money to pay off the ranchers?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've been through the books.<eos> There's no wire.<eos> - He sold his personal stock.<eos> - No, he didn't.
- It's so big.<eos> Now, this is very important.<eos> Focus.<eos> Fenway Park.<eos> That's a fire hydrant right there.<eos> Nothing famous about that.<eos> Now, this is the famous Beacon Hill.<eos> This is one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the entire city, and it's home to my sweet, sweet boyfriend, Tom Brady.<eos> - Does he really live there?<eos> - Yeah, he does.
Go over to it and sit in it.<eos> - No, Abbie.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I'll go around<eos> - and I'll help you.<eos> - No, Abbie, I don't want to.<eos> What do you mean, "No"?<eos> We're gonna fall. Go!<eos> - Abbie, I'm scared!<eos> - Just do it!
Umm... Well, pretty much what it sounds like.<eos> Wait?<eos> Are you-- you're serious.<eos> Anne? How are you just telling me this now?<eos> I don't... you were so stressed out<eos> I didn't wanna make it worse.<eos> It looked like the resource thing was happening, so I didn't mention it.<eos> But now, I'm mentioning it.<eos> They have to give you some sort of grace period, right?<eos> They did.
Paul Williams, right?<eos> He's a pioneer of the California regency movement.<eos> Really great designer.<eos> Designed a lot in the fifties, which is when it looks this house is from.<eos> He's black, incidentally, which doesn't really--<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do I care about anything you're saying right now?<eos> Nikki: No, you don't.<eos> Don't you have somewhere to go?<eos> Yes. He does.
I was just saying how I wish I had some.<eos> Can't help ya there, but you're lucky you got a doctor with a sweet tooth.<eos> Would you care for a fruit burst?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Baby, what if you're right?<eos> What if she hates us?<eos> Why wouldn't she?<eos> I hate my parents.<eos> You do not hate your parents.<eos> Well, I do.
Wait, are you sure?<eos> This was full.<eos> Now it's not.<eos> Who would do something like that?<eos> One of those limp dick fuck boys.<eos> You killed yourselves for that money!<eos> I wouldn't go that far, but, yeah, it took some effort.<eos> Hold on, wait.<eos> Maybe-- maybe-- maybe it like just fell out or something.<eos> It didn't.
We'll wait till it's weaker.<eos> Hungrier, tired.<eos> And then we'll exorcise this motherfucker.<eos> You don't have the strength, Roizman.<eos> They kicked you out.<eos> Excommunicated.<eos> You're shamed.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't have the strength.<eos> But he does.
Sorry, O.J., but that traffic out there is a mother.<eos> I'm starving.<eos> Is there a lot of people out there still?<eos> Packed, right?<eos> Is this the cheeseburger?<eos> Kato, you like them burgers, huh?<eos> Oh, I love them.<eos> You told the cops you and I went out for burgers last night, right?<eos> Hmm? Yeah. Mm-hmm.<eos> You did, huh?
Nicole wasn't a gold digger.<eos> I mean, I-I knew her. She loved him.<eos> Well, they were obsessed with each other.<eos> And she really did love him.<eos> They had hot sex.<eos> Which, of course, became a problem after they broke up, because O.J. knew that she needed it all the time.<eos> And it absolutely drove him crazy.<eos> You know, when she was at that little house on Gretna Green, he used to hide in the bushes and watch her have sex with other guys.<eos> Did she know that O.J. was out there?<eos> Of course she did!
I need to find my phone!<eos> I can't find my shoe!<eos> Hey. How are you? Wait here.<eos> Okay? I'll get them.<eos> Whoa, what's-what's wrong?<eos> You guys have a movie to get to.<eos> I don't really want to get into this right now. What?<eos> No, come on.<eos> No, we don't let stuff go like that.<eos> No, we don't.
Chris, no one's asking you to date him, just prep him.<eos> He's one of those people that thinks that you can't see how he really feels because he acts polite.<eos> Well, that makes no sense, because when someone acts polite, then they are polite.<eos> Am I out of line, saying you're bringing a preconception to this because you're black?<eos> All right, Marcia, I don't expect you to understand.<eos> But there's a way that certain white people talk to black people.<eos> It's disingenuous.<eos> - Fuhrman doesn't have to be a witness.<eos> - What? He's not even the cop who entered the gloves into evidence; he doesn't have to take the stand.<eos> Yes, he does.
Scott, Lucy, in the conference room!<eos> Let's go over the Lopez prep.<eos> Mr. Cochran, is Ms. Lopez present here today?<eos> She is, Your Honor.<eos> And do you anticipate that we can hear what she has to say in one day?<eos> I would expect so, Your Honor, barring any acts of God or further child-care crisises from Ms. Clark.<eos> Your Honor.<eos> I am offended by Mr. Cochran's remarks, as a woman and as a mother.<eos> Mr. Cochran may not know what it's like to work a 70-hour work week and also take care of a family, but I do.<eos> And many other people do, too.
Ms.Lopez,justto confirm your occupation, you are the housekeeper of Mr. Simpson's neighbor, is that correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mr. Cochran has moved the court to disrupt our schedule because you threatened to leave the country, since you're being hounded by the press.<eos> I stay just for today for Mr. Johnnie.<eos> Tomorrow, I fly.<eos> So when did you make this flight reservation for El Salvador?<eos> This morning.<eos> Really?<eos> Yesterday, Mr. Cochran stated that you had had one then.<eos> I did.
Yes.<eos> Mr. Cochran has moved the court to disrupt our schedule because you threatened to leave the country, since you're being hounded by the press.<eos> I stay just for today for Mr. Johnnie.<eos> Tomorrow, I fly.<eos> So when did you make this flight reservation for El Salvador?<eos> This morning.<eos> Really?<eos> Yesterday, Mr. Cochran stated that you had had one then.<eos> I did.<eos> And I didn't.
I know it.<eos> I'm gonna find out how he did it, and when I do... there's gonna be hell to pay.<eos> But it was him.<eos> So, it was Bob Shapiro who made you live a double life while you were married with Barbara?<eos> I shut the press right down today, baby.<eos> You'll never hear another word about it.<eos> I handled it.<eos> Baby, you knew all that about me when we got married.<eos> Yeah, I knew it, Johnnie, but my friends didn't.<eos> My family didn't.
It will never fit him!<eos> I think we should have him try it on in court.<eos> I think it's a terrible idea.<eos> What if it doesn't work?<eos> You don't make a play in there if you don't know the outcome.<eos> I know the outcome.<eos> My hand is bigger than Bob's!<eos> Put me in, Coach.<eos> So, saying we wanted to, how would we present it?<eos> We don't.
You cannot tell by somebody's voice whether they are black.<eos> That is a racist statement and entirely inappropriate.<eos> Your Honor, yeah, I am offended that in America, in 1995, that we have to endure this kind of thinking.<eos> All right, I didn't make the statement.<eos> The witness did.<eos> Oh, please, Mr. Darden!<eos> I... if this is the witness' statement, then he is the racist, not me.<eos> But that is what you're suggesting.<eos> Hey, hey, hey! I suggest nothing!<eos> - Oh, yes, you did!
It is about O.J. Simpson and the "M" word, "murder."<eos> I'm not afraid to point to him and say he did it.<eos> Why not?<eos> The evidence all points to him.<eos> In February 1992, Nicole filed for divorce.<eos> She was running away from the man who said he'd kill her.<eos> She saw the explosion coming.<eos> Why else fill a safe-deposit box with threatening letters from the defendant, a will and police photos of past beatings?<eos> She knew that the bomb could go off at any second.<eos> And then it did.
Who is this?<eos> Well, he doesn't have a name yet.<eos> Hey. But he's all yours though.<eos> Why the hell'd you give me a puppy?<eos> I don't know, I just, uh... just wanted to make sure you always had a friend.<eos> You've been called the architect of the defense team.<eos> You were the first one hired by O.J. Simpson.<eos> It was the day after the murders.<eos> Who hired Johnnie Cochran?<eos> I did.
And you're sure you know what that is?<eos> Same thing men always want.<eos> And when they really want it, they give it a bath first.<eos> You're a good talker.<eos> I like that.<eos> You're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.<eos> That so?<eos> I had to work hard to get him talking.<eos> But he talked.<eos> They all do.
You will watch as my dogs devour your wild little brother.<eos> Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest.<eos> Come and see.<eos> Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North."<eos> Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.<eos> His father's dead.<eos> Ramsay killed him.<eos> - And now he has Rickon.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
Mazin, Hornwood.<eos> Two dozen more.<eos> Together they equal all the others.<eos> We can start small and build.<eos> The North remembers.<eos> They remember the Stark name.<eos> People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.<eos> I don't doubt it.<eos> But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.<eos> No, but I do.
It's all right.<eos> It really is.<eos> It's such a relief to let go of those lies.<eos> What about Loras?<eos> I love my brother.<eos> I will always love my brother.<eos> His soul is pure and perfect.<eos> His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it.<eos> He just needs... to atone for them.<eos> We all do.
The night is dark and full of terrors.<eos> "Seven save you, friends."<eos> I'm a fucking septon.<eos> What was I supposed to say?<eos> They don't believe in your Seven.<eos> They're from the Brotherhood.<eos> They follow the Red God.<eos> Aye, well, all are welcome here.<eos> Anyway, we got nothing for them.<eos> Sure, you do.
What's left for you here?<eos> You wouldn't be safe.<eos> Not while she's looking for me.<eos> Who?<eos> She doesn't have a name.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> Essos is east and Westeros is west.<eos> But what's west of Westeros?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nobody does.
I'd like to see that.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Milk of the poppy.<eos> I don't want any.<eos> Sleep is the only way you'll heal.<eos> Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will.<eos> Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.<eos> I was a famous kisser.<eos> You lads know how to kiss proper?<eos> Course we do.
Well, that's a different sort of fighting.<eos> Now, that's the truth, isn't it?<eos> You want to learn that sort of fighting?<eos> All right.<eos> All right, let's start with your footwork.<eos> Show me your stance.<eos> Now listen to me, Pod.<eos> See how your feet are about a yard apart?<eos> Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you.<eos> 'Cause they do, Pod.
Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation?<eos> It's not.<eos> You understand.<eos> On some level you understand that you're an evil man.<eos> I'll leave the judgments to the gods.<eos> Well, that is convenient for you.<eos> You're a fine-looking fellow, aren't you?<eos> Your square jaw, your golden armor.<eos> Tell me, I want to know.<eos> I truly do.
All right, tell me.<eos> What should we do?<eos> How do we get Rickon back?<eos> We'll never get him back.<eos> Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.<eos> As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long.<eos> We can't give up on our brother.<eos> Listen to me, please.<eos> He wants you to make a mistake.<eos> Of course he does.
I'm not fit to rule.<eos> We can agree upon that at least.<eos> Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?<eos> No more than Westeros.<eos> Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence.<eos> He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from Yara.<eos> He would have murdered us if we'd stayed.<eos> Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.<eos> You and I have that in common.<eos> We do.
The Breakline is no place for an Elf.<eos> It's no place for anyone as long as Demons inhabit it.<eos> Diana.<eos> How did you know that I'd be here?<eos> Because when someone tells you no, you tend to do the opposite.<eos> If you're here to stop me, save your breath.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> What you're doing is treason.<eos> If you have a better idea, I'm all points.<eos> - We do.
That's... my... ear!<eos> Little one.<eos> You came back.<eos> You owe me another ear.<eos> Sure you want to do that?<eos> It happened when I hit the water.<eos> I floated downstream, and it slammed into this jagged rock.<eos> Thought I was going to drown.<eos> Do you think he made it?<eos> Of course he did.
That was... insane.<eos> I mean the kiss.<eos> Because that kiss... That was nothing to be sorry for.<eos> Wil, It's like you said, we can't let our feelings get in the way.<eos> Just so we're clear... my feelings aren't "in the way."<eos> My feelings for you are what keeps me going.<eos> Fancy meeting you here.<eos> Elf Hunters, huh?<eos> Do you know anything, or not?<eos> Of course, I do.
A time to celebrate.<eos> You know, it's a shame you never stay past sundown.<eos> There's fireworks, and singing, and dancing, and feasting, of course.<eos> But the best part of all...<eos> Do you see those lamps and altars?<eos> We use those to speak to the loved ones that left us behind.<eos> We listen to their tales, and guide their safe return to the blissful pure land.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you speak to someone?<eos> Yes, I did.
Monkey, do you ever say anything encouraging?<eos> I encourage you not to die.<eos> "I encourage you not to die."<eos> Mosquitoes.<eos> Annoying.<eos> Wasn't me, I swear.<eos> Paper runs out, as does patience.<eos> I didn't ask them to do that.<eos> The second time.<eos> I didn't!
You want to be human?<eos> Then share their weakness!<eos> Suffer their humiliation!<eos> Feel their pain!<eos> This is the end of your story.<eos> Now, take one last look with that lonely eye, one last look at this wretched place you call home.<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> For every horrible thing down here, there's something far more beautiful.<eos> My mother saw it.<eos> So did my father.
Fred, put the siren on.<eos> Get me to the Port Committee, quick!<eos> Regional Prefect?<eos> I believe the port should be modernized so I'm in favor of the sale.<eos> - Development Minister?<eos> - In favor.<eos> And the representative for the Minister of Finance?<eos> In favor.<eos> You don't want a casino?<eos> No, we don't.
How does it work with Mum when you go to the market?<eos> One of us is always with her.<eos> When you came to pick me up at the station, she was alone Locked in her room.<eos> I don't like locking her, Julieta.<eos> I do it to protect it her.<eos> That's no life.<eos> Julieta, we're all doing as well as we can.<eos> Do you know what it would cost to put your mother in a nursing home?<eos> I thought you hired a woman to care for her.<eos> Sana'a does.
I had always been called Katende.<eos> She was the one who told me my name was Robert.<eos> Robert Katende, I'm your mother.<eos> I stayed with her for two years.<eos> And she became my everything.<eos> Then, this one Saturday... my grandmother came crying Mother's name.<eos> And I knew, in that moment, that... Mama had died.<eos> I lost her for a second time.<eos> I, too, thought things could never change.<eos> But they did.
Rostov!<eos> I didn't expect you so soon!<eos> Sorry. You know Captain Berg?<eos> - He's in our company.<eos> - Happy to make your acquaintance.<eos> Well.<eos> You look... I don't know... You look like a real cavalryman now.<eos> And you look like the cat that's got the cream.<eos> You Guards get the best of everything, don't you?<eos> We do, we do. The receptions, the dinners, the balls.
They'd be much better off staying at home.<eos> It's a bad business, Tikhon.<eos> Well, better get it over with.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Perhaps with her hair done up high like this?<eos> Oui, peut-être. Ooh, and with a silk ribbon to tie it up?<eos> Katya, go fetch us a ribbon to match with the dress.<eos> We are going to make you look fit for a prince.<eos> You know, you have to make a little effort, dear Marya.<eos> Everybody does at these times.
The thing is though, what we do for people, it's not dangerous.<eos> It's good, Father.<eos> It's good work.<eos> I wish you'd let me show you, and let me help you talk to your wife.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just...<eos> I assumed you'd want to.<eos> Who says I don't want to?<eos> I didn't have a chance to tell her all the things I wanted to tell her before she passed away.<eos> Hmm. We never do.
To stop the voices.<eos> I didn't do it!<eos> Daddy did.<eos> To stop the voices.<eos> Sweetie, don't.<eos> I just wanted to be able to talk to Daddy again.<eos> I just wanted you to be able to talk to Daddy.<eos> He's gone.<eos> He lives in the dark and the cold and he screams and screams and...<eos> No, he doesn't.
Me?<eos> Tell me, how long has this been going on?<eos> A week? Two?<eos> A month?<eos> More?<eos> How long have you been lying?<eos> And what for?<eos> Some boy from another tribe?<eos> I don't understand you.<eos> I really don't.
Look at you, Arthur.<eos> A man who wants to live a clean life, here you are signing up for the biggest robbery of all.<eos> I have to hand it to you, Tom, you're a smart man...<eos> Are you in or out, Charlie?<eos> Curly?<eos> - Shouldn't have killed the stag, Tommy.<eos> - Oh, shut up.<eos> - Bad luck...<eos> - Shut up. How do we know this foolish man will hand over the diamonds - when we're done?<eos> - We don't.
Forgive me.<eos> May God protect you.<eos> Mother, I beseech you, tell me the truth.<eos> What did you do with the child?<eos> - What I had to.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> I entrusted him to God.<eos> - I don't understand! - You don't?<eos> Don't you believe in Providence?<eos> I do.
So?<eos> Well, so, it would take a human body significantly longer, depending on mass - and body fat, of course.<eos> - So why would a cop stand around for hours, waiting to get frozen?<eos> She wouldn't.<eos> Which means your suspect wasn't using liquid nitrogen.<eos> He was using supercooled liquid helium.<eos> It's one of the most effective substances in the world for rapid temperature reduction.<eos> This liquid helium, where do you get it?<eos> - Why do you need it?<eos> - He doesn't, dummy.
Here, let me, let me get you a chair?<eos> No, help me back to bed, won't you?<eos> Of course.<eos> They're for my condition.<eos> - Your heart?<eos> - I have a hole in it.<eos> It keeps getting bigger apparently.<eos> I think my demons are feeding on it.<eos> You have demons?<eos> Sadly, I do.
Murder weapon was a crowbar.<eos> We found it under the couch.<eos> Your fingerprints were on it.<eos> At Union Station, I used a crowbar to open up the locker.<eos> Somebody must have picked it up.<eos> And that someone just happened to know that you'd be paying Officer Pinkney a visit tonight?<eos> I told you, I didn't know that he lived there.<eos> Forensics traced the bomber's call to a pay phone in the building.<eos> Bullock will back me up.<eos> He did.
Like some coffee?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> There we go.<eos> How long has Bruce been living with Selina Kyle?<eos> Ever since the Matches Malone debacle.<eos> Turns out staring into the cold, dead eyes of the man that killed your parents doesn't bring the right amount of closure.<eos> Bruce never should've been in that room.<eos> I should've gotten to Malone first.<eos> Yes, you should have done.<eos> But you didn't, did you?
Oh, good choice.<eos> Hey, Jim.<eos> Be careful out there.<eos> Always.<eos> It's gonna be a bad day for the hit men of Gotham.<eos> I said, where's The Lady? !<eos> No one knows!<eos> Wrong answer.<eos> Someone knows.<eos> I don't.
Alfred!<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Give us a minute, please.<eos> I think we can safely say Azrael has gone rogue.<eos> I'm not comfortable making that assumption just yet.<eos> But it's been more than 24 hours since he's made contact.<eos> Perhaps that's because Jim Gordon still breathes.<eos> But if the police catch him first, how do we explain...<eos> Something that cannot be explained?<eos> We don't.
What?<eos> He was cheating on me.<eos> But you know what?<eos> No. No, no, no.<eos> I'm not gonna burden you with that, okay?<eos> I will deal with that myself.<eos> There's been a jailbreak, and the Mafia's at it again.<eos> Hey, what's going on here?<eos> I didn't realize we had more questions to ask Mr. Gotaro together.<eos> Oh, we don't.
Exclusively the lumbar.<eos> So my spine'll hurt a little.<eos> It's only a highway holding all your body's nerves.<eos> Mm-hmm. You guys have an extra mouse for my computer?<eos> No.<eos> But, hey, here, you can borrow mine.<eos> Terry knows his keyboard shortcuts!<eos> Whoop. Just deleted everything.<eos> - Sir, we have a problem.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
For my plan to work, he's gotta be basting in sweat.<eos> Hitchcock, you once told me you could roll that chair anywhere.<eos> Think you could take it up those stairs?<eos> I once rode a chair home in a blizzard.<eos> So, yeah, I can go up stairs.<eos> So do it.<eos> Oh, he's amazing.<eos> He's like a big, lazy Michelle Kwan.<eos> But how's he gonna get up the stairs?<eos> Jake! He already did.
We're gonna get the rest of these guys.<eos> It's time for Operation Beans, phase two, the refrying.<eos> Sure you're ready to go through with this?<eos> You know what?<eos> Today was stupid.<eos> But seeing you both overcome your fears did help me, and I think we've all grown as women.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Stab me! Stab me!<eos> Do it, just do it!
Doesn't she go to, like, an adult puzzle camp every summer?<eos> Yes, but please don't bring that up.<eos> I've been throwing out her mailers.<eos> Guys, if those two aren't here, I'm thinking we must be in the wrong place.<eos> No, trust me, we're definitely in the right place.<eos> I'm 100% sure about this.<eos> Well, guess who solved the puzzle?<eos> - Who?<eos> - We did.<eos> Oh, we did?
- So, what have you learnt so far, then?<eos> Anything exciting?<eos> I think he's having an affair.<eos> - Probably.<eos> - His mind's not on the job.<eos> CID, they're all tossers.<eos> Why do we not like doing house-to-house, us wooden-tops?<eos> Why did they all groan when she announced it?<eos> Because... when do they come and help us out with our workload, eh?<eos> They don't.
How sweet!<eos> Okay, I'll check out my parents' room.<eos> - Ta-dah!<eos> - Are you sure it'll work?<eos> Why shouldn't it work?<eos> - Maybe it's out of date.<eos> - May 2017.<eos> What is it?<eos> Don't you want to do this?<eos> No, I do.
MAN: (OVER RAND) You say you're a citizen and pay your taxes, but I condone that you pray for a man of God... (CARS HONKING)<eos> Hey, somethings wrong with you.<eos> We thank God for this free country.<eos> We have liberty, but they abuse it.<eos> Can't believe this traffic. Jesus.<eos> Fuck it, take me to the apartment. (MUSIC PLAYING)<eos> RICHIE: What was that? Do you hear that?<eos> Pull over.<eos> - The expressway is right here.<eos> - Just do it.
It didn't happen to you.<eos> He didn't fucking do it to you.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> So an hour goes by. Then two.<eos> Then I get word this little asshole's in the hospital.<eos> In the fucking hospital.<eos> Not for nothing, but he does have pretty bad asthma.<eos> What's that?<eos> Asthma.<eos> They all do. All the Osmonds.
She's fucking your brother.<eos> You know, your eyes, they're sparkling like the Nile. You know that? Fuck!<eos> Motherfucker!<eos> - I'll fucking kill you.<eos> - Richie, calm down.<eos> - Calm the fuck down. - He put his fucking hands on me.<eos> Calm down.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What the fuck did you do?<eos> What did I fucking do?
You know, all this stuff together.<eos> I don't know why that is.<eos> Not...<eos> I mean... Do you know what I mean?<eos> It's really beautiful, Abbie.<eos> Do you want to fool around... With me?<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
It's interesting.<eos> What's it like... for girls?<eos> What?<eos> Sex?<eos> Orgasms.<eos> Do you really want to know what it's like?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't have them.<eos> What?<eos> None of my friends do.
I, uh, I love you.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I think that I'm too close to you... to have sex with you.<eos> I know it's confusing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can... i can help you get over that.<eos> I don't want to get over that.<eos> Yes, you do.
Hal has the big room all set up.<eos> - Can I walk you in?<eos> - We got ribs, brisket.<eos> - Do you remember that place...<eos> - We're vegetarian now.<eos> Get this shit out of here.<eos> Move.<eos> All of it.<eos> You don't got no Danish at 11:00 in the morning?<eos> Of course we do, sweetheart.
Sure, what the hell?<eos> You bring a checkbook with you, Mrs. Finestra?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Great.<eos> There's a 150 charge for this meeting and Sylvia will give you a questionnaire.<eos> You can fill it out at home.<eos> Your secretary said on the phone that there would be no charge for the initial consultation.<eos> - Well, she was mistaken.<eos> - What if I hadn't brought my checkbook?<eos> Lucky for me you did.
It's a Christmas album.<eos> Oh, what you gonna call it?<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something like "Robert Goulet's Christmas Album."<eos> Oh.<eos> How about something in a neighborhood of "Christmas With Bob"?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> Does he go by Bob?<eos> - Yeah, he does.
Why all this?<eos> Why this charade?<eos> And what are you suddenly trying to be?<eos> Ranjit?<eos> - Look at these people.<eos> - Why?<eos> Amrita, look at them.<eos> Some of them have been working in our office... for 5... 10... 12 years.<eos> But I didn't even know their names.<eos> Unfortunately, now I do.
- Was that where it was?<eos> Yes, don't you remember we like thought we were gonna go to this horrible slum thing, and it ended up being this mansion, and we didn't...<eos> - tuxedo park.<eos> Yes, and everybody was actually wearing a tuxedo in tuxedo park.<eos> And we had like jeans, and nothing else.<eos> - Yes, yes, yes.<eos> - Him.<eos> Him.<eos> - He liked me.<eos> - Yeah, he did.
- Don't go. Promise?<eos> - Promise.<eos> Champagne?<eos> - Oh, I probably shouldn't...<eos> - Please.<eos> What is it?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> He doesn't love me any more.<eos> He loves Julie Karagina.<eos> No, he doesn't.
You'll find out.<eos> No word from Nikki yet?<eos> You think they've forgotten all about us?<eos> I wouldn't be surprised if they had.<eos> It's all right for them. They get to do things, - we just have to sit about and wait.<eos> To think of Nikolai in danger, I can't bear it.<eos> I used to cry when he fell over and hurt his knee and now he has to face bullets.<eos> Don't.<eos> Do you think about him all the time?<eos> Of course I do.
Can you try the room?<eos> Certainly, sir.<eos> I'm afraid there's no answer, sir.<eos> - Just give me the key.<eos> - I can't do that, sir.<eos> Just give me the damn key.<eos> - I'm afraid it's not hotel policy...<eos> - Do you know who I am? !<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I do.
These are for you.<eos> Richard Roper was recently a guest at the Meisters Hotel.<eos> Do whatever you want with those.<eos> I don't want to be involved.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, why did you do it?<eos> Why does Jonathan Pine, respected hotelier, risk his career by snitching on his guests?<eos> First in Cairo and then here.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Be careful.<eos> Excuse me, sir, could I have a vodka martini, please?<eos> You're up early.<eos> We're going shopping.<eos> You can't have too many rugs, apparently.<eos> Right.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Quite the Roper acolyte.<eos> How things change.<eos> Yes, they do, don't they?
Who's in there?<eos> Who's in there?<eos> Good boy.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Good boy.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Mr Burr always wanted to come to the Swiss Alps.<eos> He likes the peace and quiet, does Mr Burr.<eos> You don't?
No.<eos> Oh, T.E. Lawrence... of Arabia.<eos> The lonely genius who wished only to be a number.<eos> Would you put that back, please?<eos> Whose initials are these?<eos> They're my father's.<eos> It's private.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> I didn't realise it meant that much to you.<eos> Yes, you did.
He's a big lad.<eos> Is he yours?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well...<eos> What was the name?<eos> Jack Linden.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - Get out.<eos> Nobody even lives here!<eos> Well, I do now.
Suspicious chap, Corks.<eos> He's got bad vibes about you.<eos> Why did you kill that fellow in Devon?<eos> It's all over the wire.<eos> We had to call the police, no choice.<eos> They'll be here any minute.<eos> You are a cool cucumber, aren't you?<eos> He cheated me.<eos> And you didn't like that?<eos> - No, I didn't.
They want to see we're not carrying.<eos> OK?<eos> Right, Sandy, come on.<eos> Lord Langbourne.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Long trip on the high seas, sailor boy?<eos> Yes.<eos> Er... we got a little lost in the ocean.<eos> - But we got here in the end.<eos> - You did.
I will... I will call you later, and I will explain everything, all right?<eos> Mr. Lyons isn't expecting you.<eos> Oh, this won't take up much of his time.<eos> Sorry to bother you, sir.<eos> There's a Mr. Thorn here to see you?<eos> Thank you, Arlene.<eos> I need to talk to you about Ann Rutledge.<eos> Do you have any idea... how much danger you're in?<eos> So you believe me?<eos> Yes, I do.
A priest approached your father and convinced him to... to take you in.<eos> She never knew the truth.<eos> How do you know this?<eos> I know it's a lot to take in.<eos> But it's time you finally know the true circumstances of your birth...<eos> Who you are.<eos> I'll tell you everything you want to know... who that man was who tried to kill you... why your parents died... why there's so much death around you... why you couldn't save Kelly.<eos> You want answers?<eos> Come with me.<eos> How we doing on his I.D.?
She what?<eos> She... ugh.<eos> Look, man, I get it.<eos> You've been through a lot lately.<eos> What do you say we get out of here and get some much needed RR?<eos> We got a few weeks before we head out.<eos> I got us a gig in Kiev for, uh...<eos> Harold Rolston.<eos> We don't work for Reuters.<eos> Yeah, well, we do now.
And you folks thought it was philosophy?<eos> You folks are bigger losers than I am, f****rs!<eos> Come on, sing the song already!<eos> And you're the biggest loser, since you still don't get it!<eos> We aren't here for your sermons.<eos> Sing or get lost!<eos> Sing or get lost.<eos> Sing or get lost!<eos> You want to hear a song?<eos> Do you?
There you go.<eos> Are you good?<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Who's this up in my motherfucking house?<eos> Shit!<eos> Look who it is.<eos> - What's going on, man?<eos> - Chance! How you doing, brother?
Hold on, please.<eos> Did his phone ring?<eos> I'm so sorry. I have to take this call.<eos> It's another ragtag group of girls trying to start their own sorority.<eos> They're real alternative, real edgy.<eos> What to do?<eos> Guys, we gotta act fast.<eos> What are we gonna do? I don't know.<eos> We don't have enough for a month.<eos> Shit, what do we do?
It has been funny.<eos> Anna? Anna?<eos> Anna?<eos> No!<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> I to kill someone.<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> I want to know who I am.<eos> You have not to do this.<eos> I do.
I'm getting while the getting's good.<eos> But before I do... figured I'd pay my tab.<eos> Where the hell did you get this?<eos> Now, you know better than to ask.<eos> Point is, you spent your retirement fund getting me out.<eos> Well, you're too old to be slinging drinks, so...<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know how to reach me?<eos> No one knows how to reach you. - He does.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
I can't thank you enough, Count Rostov, and you, Countess, for your kindness to me.<eos> Nonsense it's our pleasure.<eos> You're one of the heroes of Austerlitz.<eos> Nothing to be proud of, sir I'm just a man who loves to fight.<eos> It's all I know, to my shame.<eos> Don't disparage yourself, Fedya none of us will believe it anyway.<eos> Then I'd better say nothing about myself at all.<eos> How is your mazurka coming along, Natasha?<eos> Well, we thought we were doing very well, until Denisov told us we were doing it all wrong.<eos> - You did.
To choose or be chosen.<eos> And then, that's our lives settled... for ever.<eos> It's frightening.<eos> You just have to choose right, that's all.<eos> But how will I know?<eos> You will.<eos> But will I?<eos> I'm sorry, Nikki, I just don't like him.<eos> Why on Earth not?<eos> Everyone else does.
All I know is what I feel.<eos> And I'm sure Pierre was in the right when he challenged him.<eos> Oh, Pierre!<eos> He's an idiot.<eos> No, he's not.<eos> I'd trust him with my life.<eos> Whereas, that one can't you see he's trying to take Sonya from you?<eos> He's just being nice to her.<eos> He likes you, too.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Evolving?<eos> Men don't change!<eos> If you could drain the blood from their veins and put in water, there might be no war!<eos> You're talking old women's nonsense, sir, but I'm happy to see that there are still a few idealists left on Earth.<eos> I want you to go to Otradnoe.<eos> The marshal there, Count Rostov, has failed to produce half the men required of him.<eos> The army still needs to be maintained, even in this time of so called peace.<eos> Rostov needs someone to ginger him up a bit.<eos> Do you know the man, at all?<eos> - No, I don't.

Nikolai.<eos> Are you cold?<eos> Not a bit.<eos> Tasha?<eos> No, I'm perfect.<eos> We could live like this, in the country, all the time.<eos> I wish!<eos> Do you? Do you really?<eos> Of course, I love Andrei.<eos> Of course, I do.
A hunter, what do you mean?<eos> I mean he doesn't just skin people for the hell of it.<eos> Okay, look for poachers, wildlife traffickers, black-markma smugglers, maybe even big game hunters.<eos> Seems our killer thinks I'm the ultimate trophy kill.<eos> Got tired of waiting for you to wake up, Detective Chandler.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Oh, I think you know who I am, what I want.<eos> The creature, the beast.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Sure, you do.
I don't believe in that crap.<eos> I think you do, and I think you know who it is.<eos> And seeing as someone's willing to pay $5 million to capture one, I think I should know who it is.<eos> $5 million?<eos> There's a bounty?<eos> A credible one, as well.<eos> Otherwise I wouldn't have gone to all this trouble to track him down. Who's putting up the money?<eos> How does he even know it exists?<eos> I don't know and I don't care.<eos> He obviously does.
You make a big difference, all the time.<eos> I don't.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> You affect dozens of college students, hundreds.<eos> That makes a huge difference.<eos> I know, but...<eos> Look, I want normal as much as anybody, but I've been a part of something not normal for years, ever since my best friend became a beast.<eos> Do I miss it?<eos> But did it form me, change me?<eos> Yeah, it did.
Actually, um, well, you know Free City, Laura Parks' charity?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - We understand that Mr. Noonan was incredibly devoted to that charity.<eos> - We also understand that he was... incredibly devoted to Laura Parks.<eos> Did you know the IRS was investigating Free City for misappropriation of funds?<eos> What?<eos> $790,000 missing from the charity's accounts.<eos> I had... I had no idea.<eos> Do you think Noonan knew about that?<eos> - Because Laura did.
Office hours are at 3:00.<eos> Dawes?<eos> Police. We need to talk to you.<eos> I did go by her parents' place.<eos> How come?<eos> Well, I was up for tenure, again, and I didn't get it, again.<eos> Aerospace positions are difficult to come by.<eos> Norah was on the selection committee, and I was upset.<eos> Why, she didn't vote for you?<eos> As a matter of fact, no, she didn't.
Did you find out who did it?<eos> You and Jason were pretty close, weren't you?<eos> Yes, but I have no idea who killed him.<eos> You and Jason worked on a number of projects together?<eos> Yeah. Sistex encourages teamwork.<eos> Although Jason and I haven't worked on a project together in, I don't know, almost a year.<eos> I miss working with him.<eos> - I know it's difficult, but do you know if Jason was working on something outside the office on his own?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - I don't...
Maybe he knew about Russo framing Tendler.<eos> He was gonna give sealed testimony in front of a closed grand jury.<eos> You think Sandra Russo, a decorated police officer, our captain, murdered Shane Barton to cover a lie that she told?<eos> This is a lot to swallow, Al.<eos> We have to follow the evidence, and the evidence right now points to her as the prime suspect.<eos> I can tell you've got something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You are not gonna believe this.<eos> Uh... Look, now, I spent the whole day on Gibson Rowan's computer.<eos> He definitely did Barton's murder.
I heard you had a family.<eos> Things were going good for you.<eos> Maybe I just missed the house.<eos> I read scripture to him.<eos> It didn't do anything.<eos> Holy water irritated him severely, but had no long-term effect.<eos> Will you pray with me?<eos> You are very brave to return.<eos> He doesn't like the light.<eos> My mother didn't either.
Why'd you want to go there?<eos> 'Cause I might be able to do one thing.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Bang, got you, you're dead.<eos> Come on, Ellen, now you're dead.<eos> Ellen, for goodness sakes, turn down the drama.<eos> The neighbors are gonna think someone's dying over here.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Hey, don't suppose any of you kids want any ice cream, do you?<eos> - I do!
Okay. So, let's say you and Steve go out to dinner at, uh... well, Birdie's.<eos> That's where you're all headed today, right?<eos> All right.<eos> So, both of you have a great meal.<eos> It's chicken-fried steak and green beans, and it's all perfect.<eos> Here comes the check.<eos> "Hey, wait a doggone..."<eos> 24 bucks for a side of buttermilk biscuits?<eos> "That doesn't sound right, now, does it?"<eos> No, it does not.
Oh, wow.<eos> Thanks, Erin. Yeah, no worries.<eos> Shoot. Where'd I put that?<eos> Thanks, that's...<eos> Man, do you believe Chuck in there?<eos> Jesus. Solicitation?<eos> Let me tell you, when we were building this case,<eos> I was chasing down 80-year-old mall walkers.<eos> That was solicitation. But did he say "boo"?<eos> Bullshit he did.
Really?<eos> From where?<eos> Schweikart Cokely.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Rich Schweikart said that they would even pay off my law school loans.<eos> That's great!<eos> Please let me be there when you tell Howard. Please.<eos> So why the sad puppy eyes?<eos> What, you don't want that job?<eos> No, no, of course I do.
I'll put Francis on that.<eos> You've got enough on your plate in doc review.<eos> Coming.<eos> Hey! HOWARD:<eos> Catch you at a bad time?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Come in.<eos> I hear clinking.<eos> Does that mean we have something to celebrate?<eos> We sure do.
Yesterday morning was the worst professional humiliation of my life.<eos> A single transpositional error cost my client time and money and permanently damaged my reputation.<eos> But then I realized... it wasn't an error.<eos> Not at all.<eos> A week ago last night, I was right there on that couch, barely conscious, and Jimmy showed up.<eos> And he sent Ernesto away.<eos> My brother was gonna take care of me.<eos> And in the dead of night, he went through my Mesa Verde files.<eos> Uh, you know what? We don't have to listen to this.<eos> She does!

We don't have to listen to this.<eos> She does!<eos> You do... for your own good.
You mean sleep with my husband?<eos> But my lover would be furious.<eos> Well, he's not the one that's pregnant, Louise.<eos> But how will I raise a child with a man who is not the father?<eos> All that matters is that... the child is brought up with love.<eos> Good evening, my beautiful wife.<eos> And how was the rest of your day since last we met?<eos> Not bad.<eos> I take it you had a good day.<eos> Aye, as a matter of fact, I did.
We can bring them with us.<eos> All of them?<eos> What of our tenants?<eos> Leave them to the--the mercy of the British butchers if the Culloden is lost?<eos> - Your name on that document brands you as a traitor to the British.<eos> And you will be hung as one if they catch you.<eos> We can't stay.<eos> We know what will happen if the Jacobites lose the war.<eos> But... but what if they win?<eos> They don't.
Dismissed!<eos> Move it!<eos> Bloody sheep.<eos> A word with ye, Uncle.<eos> Listen, lad, I ken ye're trying to do what ye think is best, but I was teaching men to fight while you were still sucking your mother's tit, God rest her.<eos> So I think I know a wee bit more about this than you do.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I ken what these men will face, and I know how to prepare them for it.<eos> You don't.
He knows about your offer... and he knows why I was forced to make the decision I did.<eos> And he took no issue with it?<eos> None.<eos> Well, he, uh...<eos> He is a better man than I.<eos> Truer words have never been spoken.<eos> I can see that ye still bear a grudge.<eos> Let's get one thing clear, Dougal MacKenzie.<eos> If I ever thought of you, then I might hold a grudge for all the things that you've done to me.<eos> But I don't.
There, sir.<eos> Right there is your enemy.<eos> Yet we do nothing but sit here and twiddle our thumbs.<eos> And what would you have the Lord General do, John?<eos> Pardon me, Quartermaster O'Sullivan.<eos> Well, attack, damn it.<eos> Pardon me, Your Highness, but... but for the life of me, I cannot understand why General Murray insists we waste our time in dilly-dally.<eos> I rushed the army here to ensure our possession of the high ground.<eos> And now you wish us to abandon such a strong defensive position and attack the enemy in force?<eos> Indeed I do, sir.
Go now, but be careful.<eos> Tell him to come back straightaway to speak with Mr. Anderson.<eos> Here, you say? Aye.<eos> Or thereabouts.<eos> I don't ken much from maps.<eos> There's no such path marked.<eos> Marked or no, it's there.<eos> As I told Mrs. Fraser, it's a narrow, winding path, hard to spot in daylight, and hopeless to find in the dark.<eos> Unless ye ken where to look.<eos> And you do?
The moment I believe you are no longer necessary to this endeavor, you go on that ship, that ship turns back for London, and soon thereafter, you swing over Wapping.<eos> Except that you can't actually do any of those things.<eos> No?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause you don't know that Samuel Wayne has never once paid for a drink.<eos> Because you don't know that the Boyd brothers can't be in the presence of anyone from Captain Moulton's crew.<eos> 'Cause you don't know which of the street merchants is in the pocket of the brothel madam.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't know... you don't know.<eos> But I do.
You weren't there.<eos> No, I wasn't. But had I been there, there would be no question about any of this.<eos> Had I been there, we would have mounted the defense that we had agreed to mount.<eos> Had you been there, you would have seen their faces, the ones who laid their arms down and turned their backs on us.<eos> The ones who took our money for months and were happy to try and deliver my head to our enemies for a little more of it.<eos> Nassau is dead.<eos> It doesn't deserve anything else from me or the men on this beach.<eos> We are finally free from it, and I see no reason to change that.<eos> If you wish to leave this place, I'll allow it, although somehow I don't think you have any intention of leaving.<eos> No, I don't.
I understand why you did it.<eos> I know what it feels like to lose everything and feel powerless to do anything about it.<eos> The temptation to keep something to show for it all, I understand it.<eos> But it does not change the reality we face.<eos> That you face.<eos> For I assure you, if Spain invades over this, yours will be the first face they see.<eos> I heard Henry Avery's name when I was a boy, heard the way people spoke it-- grown men in awe of it.<eos> I came to this place so determined to do the same.<eos> That's not going to happen the way I thought it was, is it?<eos> It never does.
Would you even be able to tell the difference?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - So you came here when you were...<eos> You're going to have to earn your next question.<eos> I don't have time for games.<eos> No, you don't, but you're going to play anyway.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I want to be heard.<eos> But for that to happen, I need someone to listen.<eos> And if I don't?
And yet she has never even mentioned this guy.<eos> That's the way it goes, Cheese.<eos> I thought I knew everything about Lou Junior, when he was down at Ohio State.<eos> Out of nowhere, he comes dragging home this Buckeye that he's been dating for over a year.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nice girl, but still. She's so controlling.<eos> I'm sorry. I don't mean it like that because I don't know her that well.<eos> But I don't like her.<eos> I don't.
And the bowling alley is regulation.<eos> That's quite nice and that's very rare to have something that nice.<eos> And the polish that he used was quite... It was good. But...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> About everything, of course.<eos> Honestly, I didn't know how to explain him over the phone.<eos> I just kept imagining... Mom Googling Laird Mayhew and you guys jumping to conclusions before you even got a chance to know him.<eos> Well, now we know him.<eos> No, you don't.
I started calling him Dad.<eos> Oy vey.<eos> The fuck, man!<eos> Why would you call him Dad?<eos> You're putting him at unease!<eos> You have to find a way in.<eos> You have to do something for him that's truly special so that he knows that your intentions are pure.<eos> Dude, Goose, I don't know how to talk to the guy.<eos> It's like we speak two different languages or something.<eos> You do.
I need to talk, Bobby... with somebody I trust.<eos> You can certainly talk to me, if you like....<eos> You are family. Yeah.<eos> Yes, so whats the matter?<eos> I've decided I'm gonna leave my wife.<eos> Oh! Okay...<eos> I've been back and forth about this decision many times but the conclusion I come to:<eos> I've fallen in love with another woman and I can't live without her.<eos> Wow! I'm no expert in this area. But of course these things do happen.<eos> Not to me, they don't.
Okay, it's a deal.<eos> I don't wanna ask you, who you are in love with. I guess it's some ravishing movie star?<eos> No. She's not a movie star.<eos> I'm not shallow.<eos> I... I'm not seduced by cheap glamor.<eos> I value substance and character.<eos> Who the hell do you think I am?<eos> I wasn't implying anything like that.<eos> I was just thought it might be Hedy Lamarr, because how much she adores you.<eos> What! ? All of your clients do.
"Green, David, yes."<eos> I think I know why that bowl was there.<eos> And it relates to the modus operandi of Paul Spector, Peter Baldwin.<eos> Are you sure he killed all those girls?<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Why are you protecting him, David?<eos> No-one has any idea how bad Gortnacull House was.<eos> Only those that were there.<eos> - I have some idea.<eos> - No, you fucking don't.
The ambulance men came.<eos> They... ..they told me to wait in my room.<eos> I looked out the window and... ..I remember this red blanket that they used to cover her when they wheeled her out.<eos> All that day, people came and went and nobody told me what had happened.<eos> Then later someone said that she'd "gone to a better place."<eos> I suppose I knew she was dead but... there was a part of me that thought maybe she was alive... ..living elsewhere... ..in a better place because I wasn't there.<eos> The last memory I have of her, she was very angry with me, angry for something I'd done. I don't know what.<eos> You know you worked on a suicide helpline for some years?<eos> No.<eos> You did.
A what?<eos> Dad?<eos> Oh, Evie. Thought I'd lost you.<eos> I'm so sorry I worried you.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're safe.<eos> In the end, that's all that matters.<eos> Mother sends her love.<eos> Well, we have a lot to talk about, don't we?<eos> We do.
What?<eos> It's loaded.<eos> Easy, easy.<eos> Give me it!<eos> How do you, like, put the bullets in it?<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> Bradley-- no, I didn't.<eos> Shut up. You cannot play with this!<eos> Well, you shouldn't have left it out then.<eos> I didn't.
Phrasing, boom.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> Shut up.<eos> And then talk again, but only to help me think of a way to kill Barry.<eos> Why don't we just find his mother?<eos> Why, just so she can bury him?<eos> Yeah, because trying to kill Barry has gone so well for you in the past.<eos> Yeah, Lana, but this time it's, um...<eos> Were you gonna say, "This time it's personal"?<eos> Yeah, but I didn't.
But when did you know?<eos> Do you always know?<eos> I was married to a guy.<eos> A long time, I was married.<eos> I always knew.<eos> I mean, I'd be attracted to other girls, co-workers, friends, some waitress that served me.<eos> They were crushes.<eos> God, they were crushes.<eos> Never acted on any of it.<eos> Never did anything.
If I don't win this vote, Rate will challenge me to single combat.<eos> - You'll win the vote.<eos> - We can't know that.<eos> Rate.<eos> You're still here?<eos> You're free of your pledge to avenge Bayen's death.<eos> The Skinshifter is dead.<eos> But the man who forced it to do his bidding still lives.<eos> If I lose and I'm challenged, my brother thinks I'll step aside.<eos> Everybody does.
I'll do my best.<eos> Good. But until then, no footage, no proof.<eos> Look, I'm not making this up, you dick.<eos> So then tell me this.<eos> Why didn't you just stick around and find out what was going on, before you came back and started scaring everybody?<eos> Because the lab was about to explode.<eos> Somebody set the lab to self destruct.<eos> Right.<eos> We don't have a self destruct.<eos> No, actually we do.
-I'm not doing it.<eos> -But we both know that you will.<eos> -I'm not going back.<eos> -I know that you do because I've already been in this conversation as you.<eos> No, this can't be happening.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> You have no choice.<eos> Why?<eos> Why do I have to kill people?<eos> Because I already did!
And you will build it up, you will drive its agenda, and slowly but surely, you will turn those members into paid-up guardians of the Second Amendment.<eos> So, what?<eos> Um... Mothers For A Safer America...<eos> Achieved by making sure every last citizen is armed to the teeth?<eos> Liz?<eos> Jesus, is this the reputation I've garnered?<eos> Gold medalist in ethical limbo?<eos> I see no ethical problem with reframing an issue.<eos> Trying to win the female vote by taking the gun lobby and dressing it up in a frilly pink frock, it is so crude, it could only have originated in a room full of old men.<eos> Well, it didn't!
What have they got?<eos> Come on! Arguments and rebuttals.<eos> Let's have it, wake up!<eos> It's the first step toward a national register of firearms.<eos> Scare mongering.<eos> No one's even come close to proposing that.<eos> And if they did, it would have its own day in Congress. Next.<eos> And it's two steps away from confiscation.<eos> The gun lobby's rhetoric is based on the falsehood that we want to take something away from people.<eos> We don't.
Find another way.<eos> It was a rude awakening for Michigan Senator, Hank Badgley, today as he was tailed from his home to his workplace by this...<eos> What the fuck is that?<eos> ...organized by gun safety campaigners in response to what they perceive as a U-turn on his support...<eos> Can you believe...<eos> I do not fucking believe!<eos> ...in the shadow of a giant rat.<eos> It's on all of the national news outlets.<eos> How the hell did she manage that?<eos> She didn't.
And she said to him,<eos> The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.'<eos> And they bound him in shackles, brought him to Gaza and gouged out his eyes."<eos> That's what he thinks of women.<eos> And he followed them in his hearse.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> He waited for them to leave.<eos> There's no other reason.<eos> And the cops haven't even bothered talking to him.<eos> But you did.
I just shoved him down those stairs.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I just did.<eos> I wish I could tell you something else, but I just did it.<eos> It was like... like pushing open a door.<eos> You just push it.<eos> You know what I felt after?<eos> Bad for my mom.<eos> She never understood it.<eos> To this day, doesn't.
Go on.<eos> - I remember doing it but I don't remember why... -<eos> Don't go seeking after glory.<eos> It'll find you.<eos> Slean?<eos> He didn't succeed his father.<eos> It was Hrothgar's right to name his successor.<eos> He always did have a sense of mischief.<eos> You don't think a woman can rule?<eos> Many do.
Content is not really relevant, is it?<eos> Enjoy!<eos> OK, I've got chemical elements here.<eos> - Oh. Lots and lots.<eos> - Can we have a story?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's a great idea.<eos> Then someone goes and tells Dr Caldwell and I'm in the sweat box for a week.<eos> We won't tell.<eos> We promise.<eos> We did stories last time.
Complicated how?<eos> I should have never told her about my fucking uncle.<eos> Aaron Boedicker?<eos> - They did some business, right?<eos> - She was his business.<eos> He was cooking that junk up in his bathtub before she got involved.<eos> She's the one that gave him cash as long as he didn't deal in Banshee.<eos> That was the deal.<eos> - I told her he wouldn't stick with it.<eos> - And he didn't.
Get comfortable.<eos> You want to check out some of the posters or, you know, some of the DVDs?<eos> I'm gonna get us some cocktails and then we're gonna start the audition, okay?<eos> We're gonna make it vodka.<eos> Yeah, buddy.<eos> You got me.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> A concerned citizen.<eos> I don't think you want to mess with me.<eos> I do.
They did a real number on him.<eos> - He'll be okay.<eos> - How about you?<eos> I really need to get the fuck out of here.<eos> Hello, Ted.<eos> - How is he?<eos> - Innocent and Brock knows it.<eos> Well, the evidence says otherwise and the sheriff has to follow up.<eos> You got something for me?<eos> I did.
Did you know that Proctor was in the drug business<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> There are neo-Nazis crawling all over his warehouse.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I'm looking at them right now.<eos> Kurt, did you know?<eos> If I knew, I would have said something to you.<eos> Look, we need to take a step back and figure things out.<eos> This changes things.<eos> Not for me, it doesn't.
You shouldn't be here. Yeah?<eos> Well, bad choices are sort of my thing.<eos> But you must know something about that.<eos> I don't know who you are, but the rules here are very simple.<eos> No one walks out the same way they walk in.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna pass on that.<eos> See, I'm pretty kinky, but you guys, you're fucked up.<eos> You come here, too?<eos> - How'd you know I was here?<eos> - I didn't.
I will.<eos> I will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is there a problem, Deputy?<eos> Just answering your prowler call.<eos> We didn't call no police.<eos> - Must have been your neighbors.<eos> - Must have been.<eos> - 'Course, we ain't got none of those. - No.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm guessing you were once made to for a very long time and you didn't like it.<eos> You check the corners every time you enter a room.<eos> That's not police training. That's survival.<eos> Your demeanor towards me is complicated.<eos> You have trouble making eye contact.<eos> It's not lack of confidence.<eos> You've got a secret.<eos> Or secrets.<eos> Maybe I just don't like you.<eos> But you do.
And there was an animal in the middle of the road.<eos> I-I panicked and I crashed.<eos> I thought I was gonna die.<eos> But that's when I heard the sound.<eos> It was so loud and piercing; it hurt.<eos> It was in my head.<eos> He was talking to me in the only way that he knew how.<eos> And I knew what I had to do.<eos> They said I killed my baby.<eos> I didn't.
"A different kind of strength."<eos> And what kind of strength is that?<eos> He has the strength to believe in himself and believe in me.<eos> Susan, keep seeing him if you have to, live with him, I don't care, but do not marry him.<eos> I understand what you see in Edward.<eos> I get it.<eos> - No.<eos> - No, wait, I do.<eos> - No, you don't. No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Wait, wait, wait, I gotta pee.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, I wanna see you guys on the dance floor later.<eos> Both of you.<eos> - Tequila!<eos> - Tequila? - I wanna dance on the bar!<eos> Last time I was here, I was in a leather vest.<eos> Oh, I remember.<eos> That seems like a long time ago.<eos> Yeah, it does.
Please don't tell me that you had sex with him?<eos> No, no, but I would.<eos> Oh, God, those ears.<eos> I would tug on those babies.<eos> But I did interview with him though, back in January.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> For my job. - Oh, my God.<eos> Anyway, I didn't get it.<eos> I, uh, I heard he hired some 19-year-old muscle queen from LA.<eos> Of course he did.
Hmm? What do we do then? Well, if it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out, but at least we tried.<eos> Do you want to try?<eos> - Come in here! - Hello! Come on!<eos> That's my paper plate.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi, guys. - Hey.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Welcome.<eos> You know, this city drives me freaking crazy sometimes, but right now, I think it feels like the best place in the world.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - Yes, it does.
Look, we assumed that Abernathy's breach was triggered by the photograph that he found.<eos> I've reviewed every dissonant episode I could find.<eos> The reaction is immediate every time.<eos> This guy makes it all the way back home.<eos> It's like he's mulling it over.<eos> You think he had an existential crisis?<eos> I think there's something fucked up going on with his cognition.<eos> And I think you feel exactly the same way that I do.<eos> Do we know where the error originated?<eos> We do.
Plekanic is a fucking cowboy.<eos> Davis is a glorified paper-pusher.<eos> But you?<eos> You make me nervous.<eos> Franco, I haven't decided on anything yet.<eos> I like you, John.<eos> We've known each other for a long time.<eos> But this job is a lot more complicated than putting away bad guys.<eos> - I think I understand that.<eos> - No, you don't.
Look, bro, I haven't talked to my mom in a year.<eos> I don't know where she's living, or if she's living.<eos> A few months ago my dad got in touch with me... started sending me money.<eos> Sending you money where?<eos> Well, I didn't have my own address, so he sent it to his place.<eos> In Miami.<eos> You know about the place in Miami?<eos> Yeah, I used to hang out there with him sometimes.<eos> Did you know about it?<eos> I did.
The drugs they found in Danny's apartment in Miami...<eos> Think it's possible someone else could have put them there?<eos> Doesn't fit with what we're working on or what we know at this time.<eos> I mean, it's possible, yes.<eos> Why?<eos> When did you know he was dealing drugs?<eos> I was suspicious when he had all that money.<eos> I knew he wasn't making all that money working here.<eos> You never said anything to me about it.<eos> No, I didn't.
Third floor upstairs.<eos> - Third?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What happened with "Shan-creek-a"?<eos> - I was just goin' over there to have an appointment with this female, and this lady came out of nowhere - and brained me with a smoothie.<eos> - Her daughter says you pushed her.<eos> Sir, I was tryin' to make an escape...<eos> - Did you push her?<eos> - After the smoothie.<eos> - So you did...
I don't know too much about these little Tribbles yet, but there is one thing that I have discovered.<eos> What is that, doctor?<eos> I like them better than I like you.<eos> Doctor, they do indeed have one redeeming characteristic.<eos> What's that?<eos> They do not talk too much.<eos> When you have the kind of cynical wit of McCoy, and you have the swagger and braggadocio of Kirk, and then you have the intellect and cold reason of Spock, he's like the perfect human being all wrapped up in one.<eos> The following program is brought to you in living color on NBC.<eos> That first night of the premiere we had to actually go to some friends' house, because they had a color TV, a big console color TV.<eos> We did not.
Yes, sir.<eos> You ever read that book "Catcher in the Rye"?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You think it ought to be in the library?<eos> Uh... Yes?<eos> That book has prostitution in it, among other things.<eos> Well, Principal Simmons, we do call ourselves the land of the free, home of the brave.<eos> I think we can handle it.<eos> Call me Deke.<eos> All my faculty does. Okay.
God--!<eos> Nope.<eos> - Nope, get him back in line.<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't.<eos> All right, listen.<eos> Don't any of you do that again.
I'm worried about Avery.<eos> Why won't you talk with her?<eos> Because she is erratic and unreliable.<eos> She needs some help.<eos> She's staying with me.<eos> She's not in school.<eos> She's broke.<eos> How is that my problem?<eos> She said you're taking clients away from her.<eos> 'Course she did.
Volunteer sign-ups for search parties are still available in the office.<eos> Oh, this is weird.<eos> -He's never this late.<eos> -I'm telling you, his stupid plan failed.<eos> I thought you liked his plan.<eos> Yeah, but obviously it was stupid, or he'd be here.<eos> If his mom found out a girl spent the night--<eos> He's in deep shit right about now.<eos> Hey, what if she slept naked?<eos> Oh, my God, she didn't.
Yeah, the neighbors might see.<eos> This is so stupid.<eos> I'm just gonna drop you off.<eos> Calm down, Barb.<eos> Come on.<eos> You promised that you'd go.<eos> You're coming.<eos> We're gonna have a great time.<eos> He just wants to get in your pants.<eos> No, he doesn't.
I'm sorry, Mom.<eos> What, you're sorry? You're... you're sorry?<eos> -That is not good enough, Jonathan.<eos> -I know. That's not even close.<eos> That's not even in the... in the ballpark.<eos> I wanted to tell you, I just--<eos> What if this thing took you, too?<eos> You risked your life... and Nancy's.<eos> I thought I could save Will...<eos> I still do.
You must attend the morning ritual in uniform.<eos> Sit down, man.<eos> - Gentlemen...<eos> - Gentlemen.<eos> ...it seems that one of you was not content last night with the hospitality of the palace and sought diversion elsewhere.<eos> Fucking-A right I did.
I'll tell you what. Our guests, they've been here for quite a while.<eos> So why don't we just sign the contracts? It's gonna take you five seconds.<eos> - Then we're gonna get you cleaned up.<eos> - I'm not signing anything. Legally it's fine, Richie. Here we go, right here.<eos> You know what? One of these days I'm gonna grab you by those muttonchops and I'm gonna turn your head like a fucking steering wheel.<eos> We're not selling the company.<eos> Richie.<eos> We have a binding verbal agreement.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Yes, we do.
I tell you about my issues with Danzig, and then in, ooh, the space of, what, 48 hours, there's a fucking investigation underway!<eos> Twelve-thousand square feet of living space and, of course, complete privacy.<eos> It's lovely.<eos> For people in our... situation, which would you recommend?<eos> Well, you can pick a school based on the villa or vice versa. I have a packet of all those options for you.<eos> And the timing can work as we've planned? Yes.<eos> These particular schools are used to business people's children coming and going for a variety of reasons.<eos> Will you be enrolling them under their real names?<eos> What?<eos> Some don't. The stigma.
This is business, right?<eos> It's always been business.<eos> You've been re-assigned to Skip Hadderly.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Talk to Evans?<eos> David didn't say.<eos> He must have said something.<eos> He must have given a reason why.<eos> No, he didn't.
- From college.<eos> Yeah. Ben Holgrem, I met him in your office.<eos> His client's suing the shit out of our client.<eos> You know.<eos> You're still in school?<eos> You'll get it, when your friends start working for different sides.<eos> I don't have any friends.<eos> Are you waiting for me to fuck you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And if I don't?
Right now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's not going to trial, I got it.<eos> Checks go to Quorta.<eos> Still the same.<eos> You've been re-assigned to Skip Hadderly.<eos> David didn't say.<eos> He must have said something.<eos> He must have given a reason why.<eos> No, he didn't.
You're making me feel very, very uncomfortable. Yeah, uncomfortable how?<eos> What-what are you talking about?<eos> I think you know what I'm talking about.<eos> Interns are just all stretched too thin? - You're all overworked.<eos> - I don't think that's what you meant.<eos> - I dunno what you're talking about... - Okay.<eos> Let's all just take it down a notch.<eos> Are you waiting for me to fuck you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And if I don't?
- Your job is to keep these people safe.<eos> Speaking of which, Olivia's gonna need your vest.<eos> Roger that. That's was a Royal Guard.<eos> - Boots on the ground?<eos> - Yes, sir, their special response regiment.<eos> They're sending in a platoon to back our boys up now.<eos> A platoon? That's it?<eos> That's all you could get?<eos> I couldn't get anything, sir.<eos> The embassy Marines did this.
Come on. - It's gonna be big!<eos> Like what?<eos> Like, what, how big? Like, what are you gonna do?<eos> I prefer not to talk about it right now.<eos> - Do you not know?<eos> - What? - Oh, my gosh.<eos> You don't know.<eos> - I know. If you don't know, then why do you wanna be boss?<eos> - I know.<eos> - You don't.
If-- if you would like us to figure out what went wrong here, we need to be allowed to access it.<eos> No more second chances.<eos> QA will handle events like this from now on.<eos> Is that going to be a problem, Bernard?<eos> We've all got plenty of work on our plates.<eos> If you guys want to take this one, fine.<eos> Just get us a copy of the postmortem when it's done.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> You know, I always figured you gave me this job because I speak my mind.<eos> - I did.
I didn't get a chance to ask where you're headed.<eos> I don't really know yet.<eos> I guess I figured they kept you in zones or on paths or...<eos> I used to believe there was a path for everyone.<eos> Now I think I never asked where that path was taking me.<eos> We would bring the herd down off the mountain in the fall.<eos> Sometimes we would lose one along the way, and I'd worry over it.<eos> My father...<eos> My father would tell me... that the steer would find its own way home.<eos> And, often as not, they did.
You should've left him on that tree to die.<eos> You believe in fate, Lawrence?<eos> If the bitch exists, I'd like to kick her in the teeth about now.<eos> Don't be so glib.<eos> You'll hurt my feelings.<eos> As another old friend of mine likes to say, "There's a path for everyone."<eos> Your path leads you back to me.<eos> You ever wonder why I've kept you with me this whole journey?<eos> Maybe you like the pleasure of my company, you sadistic fuck.<eos> Why, maybe I do.
Easy pumping that nitro into him.<eos> Fill the empties with tequila and seal them up.<eos> Your work for the revolution is not quite done yet, my friend.<eos> Careful.<eos> Slim always had a bad temper.<eos> William, we have to go now.<eos> Lazo's been conning us the whole time.<eos> He was never gonna give the nitro to the Confederados.<eos> We have to run.<eos> Of course we do.
We're not exactly in a culture where we can just let loose.<eos> I would have thought the head of narrative could do whatever he wanted.<eos> My artistic freedom is constrained, what, with qa breathing down my neck and behavior programming the damn things to go off script.<eos> The robots can go off script?<eos> Just little gestures.<eos> You know, supposedly, it makes the things more lifelike, but, really, it's just a vanity project from the megalomaniac who started this place.<eos> And frankly, i don't know why the suits at delos put up with it.<eos> Sorry, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cut you off.<eos> - Do you know who I am?<eos> - I do.
Are you married?<eos> She hasn't asked if you're married?<eos> No.<eos> Is that good or bad?<eos> Both things.<eos> Good, if she likes you so much she doesn't care if you're married.<eos> Bad, if she doesn't want to sleep with you and so she doesn't care.<eos> I didn't say I wanted to sleep with her.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - No, I didn't.
What was it?<eos> Kind of like Aretha Franklin.<eos> - Your subconscious has good taste.<eos> - Thank you, I'll tell it.<eos> And what were we doing?<eos> Watching them play.<eos> That's all?<eos> The girl sang very well.<eos> And how did it end?<eos> It didn't.
- La máximo!<eos> - What's up, chicken butt?<eos> - You're a chicken butt!<eos> - You're a chicken butt.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - You're the chicken butt.<eos> - You're a bigger chicken butt.<eos> - Daddy's a chicken butt.<eos> - These actually look really good.<eos> They do.
He wants it both ways, Mr. Irving.<eos> He wants to be the brilliant maverick, the provocateur who comes along and reinvents the Second World War.<eos> But he also wants respect, the respect of his colleagues in the club.<eos> England's a club, Deborah, and he wants to join.<eos> But he's an anti-Semite.<eos> You'd be amazed how many military historians see that as just a detail.<eos> They see him as a serious historian who happens to see things from Hitler's point of view.<eos> Yeah, but it's not a detail.<eos> You know, I think it's at the center of everything he thinks and does.<eos> So do I. Yeah.
Professor!<eos> Julie McCarthy, NPR.<eos> A quick word.<eos> We need to hear your voice.<eos> It's Julie McCarthy, NPR.<eos> We need to hear your voice.<eos> Just a quick word.<eos> Lying Jewish bitch!<eos> You think it all finished with Hitler?<eos> It didn't.
Oh, uh, yes.<eos> Well, there are glasses here.<eos> Ah, shame.<eos> I rather like plastic.<eos> Still, you can't have everything.<eos> I like to treat myself, don't you?<eos> Why should all the bad people have all the good things in life?<eos> Like this?<eos> You had a good morning.<eos> Yes, I did.

I...<eos> I'm used to it.<eos> But why would you say... that he tried to turn me against you?<eos> Just a thought.<eos> I know Antoine.<eos> You do?<eos> Sorry, I'm...<eos> It's weird you'd say that, 'cause... he... doesn't talk about you... often...<eos> Almost never, actually.<eos> And when he does...
He told me he wishes you were dead.<eos> Bobby. You set up my guy in the, uh, interview room?<eos> Yep. Good to go.<eos> Oh, his, uh, doctor's in with him.<eos> - What doctor?<eos> - The shrink.<eos> She was called for a psych eval.<eos> She said you knew about it.<eos> Damien didn't mean to hurt me.<eos> Oh, but he did.
He sounds like an asshole.<eos> Because we were young and in love.<eos> I mean, he wasn't always an asshole. I promise you.<eos> It's true.<eos> Listen, I got pregnant, we got married.<eos> I was only 20.<eos> You know what? Mike and I never got our twenties.<eos> Like, you know, the fun twenties, and...<eos> I feel like maybe he missed that. Oh, my God.<eos> Maybe I did, too.
I told you. I can never take off from my job.<eos> Hey man, look, you really gotta get a life.<eos> When you're responsible for a life, you don't have a life.<eos> Okay.<eos> You... You like go to school, to learn how say things like that?<eos> Like what?<eos> When you are responsible for a life, you don't have a life.<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> Nothing's wrong with it, it's just... Sounds smart.<eos> It does?

Bully for me.<eos> Matron, I noted, as did Dr. Foster in his inimitably collegial way, that the morning meals were late and sparse.<eos> Were they now?<eos> I wonder if it would not be too forward of me to offer my perspective on the dietary need.<eos> The steward, Mr. Bullen, does as he deems fit, given the challenges and supplies at hand.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - You've got God and miss Dix on your side, dear.<eos> Do as you deem fit.<eos> You don't want to see Mr. Bullen, miss.<eos> Yes, I do.
At the hearing tomorrow, the judge will decide if she should be released.<eos> And they want to hear from people who were involved.<eos> - Victim statements.<eos> - Statements of support.<eos> Statements that she isn't a threat to anybody. That you guys are not afraid of her anymore.<eos> There is no reason to be afraid.<eos> You know her.<eos> You heard her story.<eos> We all went through this together.<eos> Yes, we did.
Wouldn't it just be the biggest cosmic joke ever if Charlotte gets to live happily ever after?<eos> If she can do it, so can we.<eos> A toast to Charlotte.<eos> - To Charlotte.<eos> - To Charlotte.<eos> Why can't they make quiet ice cubes?<eos> - Here, hydrate.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Are you going to see Toby?<eos> I already did.
And, you know what?<eos> I'll just...<eos> I'll go get the flowers.<eos> - OK.<eos> - Uh, sir?<eos> I'm very sorry, and we will pick this up at a later date.<eos> OK, thanks, Christine.<eos> My source at the police station called it the Tug Show, actually.<eos> - He said that?<eos> - Yes, he did.
Ready now?<eos> Begin.<eos> Concentrate.<eos> - Oh, hi, Chrissy.<eos> - As you were.<eos> As you were.<eos> The name which I can see...<eos> on a sheet of paper...<eos> She seems better.<eos> She does, doesn't she?
Kateesha told me a lot about you.<eos> Yeah, you're like...<eos> You're, like, a lot plainer than I thought you would be.<eos> Well, she plain but pretty.<eos> - You're like a brick wall, just boring and rigid...<eos> - Okay.<eos> And just ashy in some places.<eos> Okay, okay, okay, okay, enough with the small talk.<eos> We have a long drive ahead of us.<eos> We do.
You don't need a key to get in a hamper, Hannah.<eos> Here, now, help me outta here.<eos> You're lucky I wasn't in your medicine cabinet, or your jewelry box.<eos> I tried to hide in your nightstand, but you had this Gideon Bible in there and I couldn't fit.<eos> Wait a minute, did you break in through that window?<eos> This one?<eos> Oh, no, that could've been anybody.<eos> The brick on the ground says "Property of Christian Black."<eos> "Christian..."<eos> Yeah, yeah, it does.
I'm not gonna...<eos> "I'm not gonna fuck with God's plan.<eos> "Who am I to rewrite what God wrote?<eos> "That's what God wrote next to your name.<eos> "It said 'death by mountain lion attack.'<eos> "Who the fuck am I to rewrite that?"<eos> I'm being honest with you all.<eos> You know the real reason why I wouldn't help my lady if she got attacked by a mountain lion?<eos> I don't know if I wanna be with a woman that survived a mountain lion attack.<eos> I don't...
"What the fuck happened to you?"<eos> It's not the same for men.<eos> I've been to the sex store.<eos> The shit that I saw, it disgusted me.<eos> The pocket mouth.<eos> The pocket ass.<eos> The pocket titties.<eos> I was disgusted.<eos> I bought all of it.<eos> I did.
It'll force Bazile's hand and get you in front of a federal three-judge panel.<eos> All right.<eos> Look, I got to catch a plane to New York tonight, but I'll work up a draft and I'll find you on Monday? Great.<eos> That's just great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah. And, Bernie, if you don't mind me asking, how much experience do you have with constitutional law?<eos> Some.<eos> Very little.<eos> You realize this case could alter the constitution of the United States?<eos> I do.
He's a widely respected source with connections...<eos> He's a fucking rent-a-quote.<eos> I know you really wrote the Birch story, and I think I know why you chose to hide that fact.<eos> If I am such a careerist, why would I ever hide something that good?<eos> 'Cause you thought it would endear you to someone.<eos> What you should have done, if you were really playing an elevated game, was come to me with what you had.<eos> See, if I had something better to give you in exchange for you holding on to it...<eos> You have never been willing to play any kind of game with me.<eos> I didn't know you were ready to play in the bigs, man.<eos> Now I do.
Yeah, no, I do understand...<eos> This way, Mom.<eos> Baby! We are so proud of you.<eos> Thank you for believing in our little girl as much as we do.<eos> Tom, that's not a problem.<eos> She sings like an angel.<eos> Well, she got it from her father.<eos> What?<eos> You got pace Mr. Calleros?<eos> Back in the day, I did my thing a little... - A little?
I'm happy to do a paternity test.<eos> So you don't know how to use a condom, stupid?<eos> !<eos> Anika, um... you gonna keep it?<eos> I begged her to.<eos> You did what, stupid?<eos> This family has already tragically lost an heir.<eos> This family uses the term "heir" as if we're in a Shakespearian play.<eos> Technically, if we're talking about heirs, we need to find Lola.<eos> No, we don't.
Next time, with an army.<eos> We're low on ammo.<eos> Best get going.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What I came for.<eos> What?<eos> These are game consoles.<eos> Right, but just the last gen.<eos> We don't have time for games.<eos> No, we don't.
Excuse me.<eos> Is this the New York Employment Center?<eos> I'm only finding day labor work.<eos> I need something permanent.<eos> We have just the thing for you.<eos> So you know, I have a record, but...<eos> Yes, we have that information.<eos> That's not an issue.<eos> The position's yours if you want it.<eos> And you do.
Our job is to find out how the Taliban knew about it.<eos> We have any ideas?<eos> Name's Brent Tomlinson.<eos> He's an Army military advisor who had advance knowledge of the shipment's schedule and payload.<eos> We think the Taliban paid him off?<eos> Could be.<eos> They're well funded with Saudi money via Qatar.<eos> Maybe they gave him some of that money.<eos> That's what we need you to find out.<eos> And if they did?
Just the way it is.<eos> We didn't make the world like this.<eos> Didn't we?<eos> I'll be leaving your name out of my report.<eos> As far as the Agency is concerned, you're still dead.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> Might be because you could've killed me the other night but you didn't.<eos> Or maybe I like knowing you're out there, a ghost, still doing what needs to be done.<eos> How'd you know it had a false bottom?<eos> I didn't.
Have you considered recoding Her with a more defensive stance?<eos> You mean arm the Machine?<eos> More like equip Her with the tools She needs to better protect herself.<eos> Self-preservation is a very close cousin to aggression.<eos> A child, your child, needs to learn to push back on the playground.<eos> That's not an instinct we should hope to nurture in any artificial super intelligence.<eos> Not even one that we call our own.<eos> She's our only ally in this war.<eos> You need to learn to trust Her.<eos> But I do, Ms. Groves.
Oh, yeah, they've been here since I was a kid.<eos> They're always accusing Daddy of something.<eos> You know they're actually taking us to trial next month?<eos> There I go with all the tequila talk.<eos> You want another drink?<eos> Sure.<eos> Sounds like the protestors have been out to get her father for years.<eos> Think they're about ready to make good on their threat to put him down?<eos> I'm more inclined to think that someone in the Turner family wants to make sure that this wedding doesn't happen.<eos> Because if it does,
- Don't know yet.<eos> Which is precisely why you should put some distance between us, John.<eos> It's not worth the risk.<eos> Street's clear.<eos> - You weren't followed.<eos> - Ms. Shaw.<eos> It's good to have you back home.<eos> Harold, do you know how they found you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
It's monitoring everything we've ever done.<eos> You said this morning we were just surviving.<eos> By then my fate had been sealed.<eos> But not yours.<eos> I would hate for my mistake to mean punishment for the rest of you.<eos> And please tell Ms. Shaw this is not her cross to bear.<eos> This lapdog has the same card.<eos> Temporary Resolutions.<eos> You want to tell me how this all-seeing eye thing doesn't see us coming?<eos> It does.
We're good.<eos> Our supervisor will be right with you.<eos> That was Harry.<eos> I gathered.<eos> He think I'm the reason his cover's blown?<eos> He knows you're not.<eos> He slipped up.<eos> He went back to the place he and Grace had their first date.<eos> Harold has a weakness.<eos> We all do.
Sure.<eos> Everyone dies alone.<eos> But if you mean something to someone, if you help someone or love someone, if even a single person remembers you...<eos> Then maybe... you never really die at all.<eos> I know I've made some mistakes.<eos> Many mistakes.<eos> But we helped some people.<eos> Didn't we?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we did.
What are you doing?<eos> Looking for you.<eos> But I'm right here.<eos> Were you singing?<eos> The fairy song.<eos> Where'd you hear it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This is important.<eos> Where'd you hear that song? I don't know.<eos> Of course you do!
Not to God or the universe, but to Death.<eos> I offered a trade.<eos> Take me, leave my daughter.<eos> But she didn't wanna make the trade, so...<eos> So, who won that round?<eos> You or the porcelain?<eos> Porcelain.<eos> Porcelain's undefeated.<eos> I'm sorry about that, I thought everyone left.<eos> Yes, they did.
And there was this woman who sat next to me. And she asked me who I was about to lose.<eos> And I told her.<eos> And she looked at me and she said,<eos> "Just be sure to notice<eos> "the collateral beauty."<eos> She said it so casually.<eos> In the next room, my six-year-old daughter was being taken off life support.<eos> And this woman says "collateral beauty."<eos> People don't know what to say in those moments.<eos> No, she did.
She's been doing this for a couple of weeks.<eos> I'm taping it so we can show a doctor.<eos> She needs a doctor, Nancy.<eos> Honey!<eos> Prairie, let go. Prairie.<eos> Nina!<eos> Prairie believes her father's alive and sneaking her messages about where to find him in dreams.<eos> She also believes her dreams are premonitions, and that the Russian Mafia are after her.<eos> Kids tell tall tales.<eos> I did myself.
-You experienced it as a choice?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Wow. You called it a near-death experience?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -So you had one?<eos> Uh, here, ketchup at midnight, mustard at four o'clock, mayo at eight o'clock.<eos> Good stuff, okay?<eos> Did I have an NDE?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't, but I, uh...
Really late.<eos> It won't matter if we're in jail.<eos> We're not stopping.<eos> Not for anything.<eos> He's not someone who accepts excuses very well.<eos> Mystery Man's got to see how committed we are.<eos> Right?<eos> Especially after what we did.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Yeah, he does. For sure.
And the day after that.<eos> - And the day after that.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And the day after that.<eos> She gone?<eos> Uh, yes, Patrick. She...<eos> She's gone.<eos> The poor kid.<eos> She really didn't have that coming, you know?<eos> No, she didn't.
Her death, I can't...<eos> I can't wrap my head around it.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> She was an amazing woman.<eos> And you are not the only one who is grieving here.<eos> So if you're done with your fucking questions, I think I'm through.<eos> I know you know something, you little weasel.<eos> All the crocodile tears in the world won't convince me otherwise.<eos> I'm gonna find out what it is and when I do...<eos> When I do...
- Maybe they did if they had help.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Oh, for fuck's sake.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> You can just collectively all go fuck yourselves.<eos> You're just gonna let him walk out of here, Commander?<eos> - In a word, yes.<eos> - Harley Cohen is at the very least a person of interest in this investigation.<eos> Don't you think it would be prudent to hold him for further questioning?<eos> I do not.
On January 6, 1948, I am persecuted for remaining faithful to the highest human aspirations And I sat down for the first time before a court<eos> Here in Chile.<eos> Why do they do this?<eos> Well, the Communists hate to work.<eos> They prefer to set churches on fire.<eos> They say they feel more alive.<eos> The Chilean aristocracy likes to show its wealth.<eos> But the poet should not be impressed.<eos> Esteve nos sal es de Paris And this provincial imitation makes you laugh.<eos> But he does.
I don't know. You don't know what it's like. I...<eos> I was supposed to... my dad by the time he was my age, he had a master's degree and, like, five medals from the Navy.<eos> And I get coffee.<eos> You do more than that, Clark.<eos> Yeah, sometimes I get donuts.<eos> I just thought I had one thing that I was good at.<eos> My mom wants me out on the street.<eos> Fuck 'em.<eos> Just pay attention to what people say.<eos> Or what they don't.
Yeah, Nuria.<eos> The truth is... we need to talk.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Sweetie.<eos> Please, you can't feel guilty.<eos> No, I feel like the worst person in the world.<eos> Surprise!<eos> Nuria!<eos> - You didn't need to come.<eos> - Of course I did.
Perhaps I should find someone else who understands what I need.<eos> Well, like a wife, eh?<eos> He will only speak with you.<eos> Mr. Grant, I would hate for you to miss an opportunity to make a lot of money.<eos> And who is this supplier?<eos> Declan Harp.<eos> The man who used to work for the Hudson's Bay Company and now steals from them?<eos> That's who you want me to meet?<eos> It sounds bad when you put it like that.<eos> Does it?
Green to red.<eos> It starts here. This place... I've seen it.<eos> Primaries.<eos> It's all in my head.<eos> Pieces, pictures, places.<eos> You... and her.<eos> Why do I always have to do bad things to get your attention?<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> I have nothing left.<eos> Of course you do.
Go and find your purpose.<eos> You do have one.<eos> One that's right.<eos> Just go.<eos> Leave all this behind.<eos> Okay.<eos> You're here to shoot me again?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know anything about them.<eos> I never did.
I'm just gathering up my things.<eos> You know, the most fun I ever had was breaking down all the walls you built around yourself.<eos> And now I get to do it all over again.<eos> Good night.<eos> So much is different.<eos> Yeah, I can see that.<eos> I noticed, uh, everybody's real cozy with Deacon now.<eos> I'm really not sure how all this is gonna work now that you're here, and not back in 2016.<eos> We have a mission to finish.<eos> We do.
They're fierce and capable of making weapons.<eos> They're extremely dangerous so as soon as you see them use full force!<eos> Take pre-emptive action. Attack them until they cannot fight back.<eos> I'd rather have them all dead, than let one escape.<eos> Boss!<eos> We've got 300 security enforcements.<eos> We'll shutting down Rue-Ian's secret laboratory.<eos> No one can get in anymore.<eos> Now, do you believe me?<eos> Now I do.
Cross-Co. Trucking.<eos> You got your balls in a vice on that one, don't you?<eos> Well, if you heard that, you must know why I'm calling.<eos> Well, it'll be fun hearing you say it.<eos> I need to borrow your shares to keep my short position.<eos> Mm. What's your proposal?<eos> 8%.<eos> 8%?<eos> This must really matter to you.<eos> It does.
Uh, if what you're telling me is true, then my cut is none.<eos> Then the S.E.C. will just take down your father and his confederates.<eos> "Will" take down? It's not, uh...<eos> It's not in the system yet?<eos> It was the end of the day by the time I'd gotten it all together with a small, trusted team.<eos> And the reason it really seems to me that you're involved is there's someone we care a fuck of a lot about on the other side getting squeezed.<eos> No, my father would never... He did.<eos> Did he, uh... Did he sell yet?<eos> No. Not yet.<eos> But when he does...
Refuse and we'll ruin your life."<eos> Either way, the results stay the same...<eos> Calvin Chadwick wins a seat in the Senate.<eos> The arena club knows what's happening tomorrow because they're making it happen.<eos> Do you have any idea the can of worms you're asking me to open?<eos> Rigging an election is a serious accusation.<eos> All the more reason to listen to Peggy.<eos> Where are those newspapers?<eos> I-I had to leave them behind.<eos> Well, of course you did.
We need him.<eos> All right.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Dr. Wilkes has designed a containment chamber to stabilize himself, but he needs a sample of zero matter.<eos> I intend to get that sample from Whitney Frost.<eos> Okay.<eos> The best chance that we have of getting close to Whitney without being detected is her husband's campaign fundraiser tomorrow night at the MacArthur Grand Hotel.<eos> Not an easy ticket to get.<eos> Howard Stark donates money to all the political candidates to ensure good favor with whomever wins, so Mr. Jarvis has two tickets secured.<eos> Of course he does.
Are these volatile?<eos> - No.<eos> - It certainly reads like uranium.<eos> - How did you do it?<eos> - It's pretty simple.<eos> I just painted some U-238 with a radium mixture.<eos> Good job, Aloysius.<eos> Really good work. Oh.<eos> See you learned my first name.<eos> Yeah, I did.
That's... not code.<eos> These are design specifications.<eos> H-Howard Stark wants me to build a machine.<eos> You?<eos> It says that?<eos> Well, no, but you see someone else here who can?<eos> What does the machine do?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> A cannon.<eos> Something to do with gamma radiation.
Don't be such a pussy. Copy.<eos> Additional units in sight.<eos> Over.<eos> What do we got tomorrow?<eos> Same shit, different day.<eos> Okay, babe, let's do this.<eos> You know who else gets your special medicine?<eos> Who?<eos> Spider-Man.<eos> No he doesn't.
But... it wasn't cold, it was septicaemia.<eos> And I wasn't there.<eos> They were at the seaside with their governess.<eos> By the time we got to her... It was too late to do anything.<eos> Winston and I sat with her for... two days.<eos> Neither of us slept.<eos> We sang nursery rhymes with her and told her stories.<eos> He'd never had the time to tell her stories before.<eos> At the end... she asked me to sing that song.<eos> And I did.
Er, on Friday.<eos> I've got two days in Yorkshire with my mum and dad.<eos> Oh, yes, take a brolly.<eos> I couldn't have got through this without you, Millie.<eos> I've written in it.<eos> "I thank whatever Gods may be for your unconquerable soul."<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will treasure it.<eos> Well, I hope this very gloomy looking young man knows how to treasure you.<eos> He does.
- Oh, good Lord.<eos> - What happened?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I walked in and he was face down on the kitchen table.<eos> And you didn't say anything that could cause his face to land on the kitchen table?<eos> No.<eos> I came home to tell him, but I never had a chance.<eos> Grace? Is that you, sweetheart?<eos> -You didn't have to come.<eos> -Of course I did.
There are invisible presences... around us, always.<eos> Whether or not they're the souls of the dead, I don't know, but...<eos> When you're a medium, you just are attuned to a certain... vibe.<eos> What do you mean by, vibe?<eos> It's an intuition thing. It's a feeling you...<eos> You see this door...<eos> It's only like slightly ajar.<eos> I also this that... the soul... continues to exist after death.<eos> I don't really know if I believe in that.<eos> But Lewis did.
I couldn't keep up.<eos> All I mean is that with Lewis, nothing seems impossible.<eos> Many religions believe that the soul wanders around for a while before leaving this world.<eos> Did he speak to you about that?<eos> He was convinced of it.<eos> Years ago, Mum died, he was sure that... he was visited by her.<eos> That it felt like a dream, but not, that it was very real.<eos> He could smell her, he could see her so clearly... you know?<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
No, I'm not gonna tell you.<eos> You tell me.<eos> Now, we can do this the easy way or we could do it the hard way.<eos> - Am I right, sweetheart?<eos> - Yes, dear.<eos> So, she's real crazy.<eos> She's a genius.<eos> Can you decipher it?<eos> I don't speak megalomaniac.<eos> Fortunately, Howard Stark does.
No more interruptions.<eos> I have to agree with Dr. Samberly.<eos> - It's terrible.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Have they determined what Whitney's designed?<eos> Show of hands... who here has invented a hover car?<eos> Nope?<eos> Nobody?<eos> I win. - It didn't even work!<eos> - The second one did.
- You know something? In all the months that we courted, I never dreamed that you could be this cruel.<eos> - Cruel?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, are you fucking serious?<eos> Cruel?<eos> I don't want to go get a scone with you this morning and now I'm cruel?<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> You're... you've got to be kidding me.<eos> I want to fucking die.<eos> - No, you don't.
Yes, I-I do.<eos> I miss it very much.<eos> I... I was a very happy boy.<eos> And then the prophet turned up, and... and told me that Elohim had chosen me and I was meant to be king.<eos> It was such an honor to be anointed.<eos> It's an honor beyond reckoning.<eos> Who would say no, hmm?<eos> No one.<eos> No one.<eos> And I didn't.
Please.<eos> She's in danger.<eos> You're Skaikru?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She was here last night.<eos> Did she say where she was going?<eos> No.<eos> She was here when I fell asleep and gone when I woke up.<eos> She give you any indication of where she might go?<eos> No... but he did.
Take them away, too!<eos> _<eos> - Lexa, please execute these traitors...<eos> - Let her make her move.<eos> Commander, what is this?<eos> This is a coup.<eos> This is the law, her law... a unanimous vote of the ambassadors or death are all that can remove a commander from power.<eos> It's not unanimous.<eos> We don't recognize the legitimacy of Skaikru.<eos> We do.
Everybody, back to your quarters.<eos> - It's over.<eos> - Nothing is over.<eos> We are surrounded by warriors who want us dead.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> - No. It isn't, not even close.<eos> Why don't you show us all what you let the Grounders do to you yesterday?<eos> Come on, Kane.<eos> I think that the people who are about to vote for you have a right to know.<eos> We do.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Stand down, Titus.<eos> _<eos> And you will use it, too, in honor of our guests this evening.<eos> Now sit.<eos> We have more important matters to discuss.<eos> Yes. We do...
Oh, come on.<eos> That's like setting the launch codes all zeros.<eos> And yet it's better than anything we've come up with.<eos> I'll check the president's office.<eos> We'll keep working the tech angle.<eos> Hopefully, one of us'll get lucky.<eos> Like that's ever happened.<eos> Where are the guards?<eos> Protocol would be to leave someone behind.<eos> They did.
They had impressive security. I'll give them that.<eos> This is useless.<eos> I'm better with hydrazine and gun powder.<eos> - Reyes...<eos> - I give up.<eos> We're too late, anyway.<eos> It's already dark.<eos> Raven...<eos> The Raven Reyes I know doesn't give up.<eos> She does now.

Wake up.<eos> You attacked an army that was there to help us.<eos> You murdered innocent people.<eos> Is that who you are now?<eos> You thought you couldn't live with yourself after Mount Weather.<eos> Well, you just started a war that'll kill us all.<eos> You need to wake up, and don't tell me the difference between Azgeda and Trikru.<eos> Trikru killed 37 of my friends before you even touched the ground.<eos> We didn't start anything.<eos> They did.
We've talked about this.<eos> Otan's with Jaha at camp. Why would you want to go there?<eos> He's my brother.<eos> If there's a chance, I have to try and get him back.<eos> Going after Otan's not a good move.<eos> - John... - It's not a survivor's move.<eos> Then wait for me.<eos> I'll come back.<eos> In this world, when people leave, they don't come back.<eos> - I did.
Bet you didn't think we'd be breaking the law together when you arrested me on the Ark, huh?<eos> This isn't a game, Nate.<eos> If we don't find out what Pike's up to, more people will die.<eos> Then let's not get caught.<eos> Chancellor Pike, good to see you.<eos> Hey, you put it somewhere smart, out of sight.<eos> I'll buy you some time.<eos> There you are.<eos> We need to talk about these things Jaha's distributing.<eos> No, we don't.
Clarke?<eos> Clarke's opinion in this matter is not exactly unbiased.<eos> Titus is right.<eos> I would do anything to save my people.<eos> You know that, but I know them.<eos> Not everyone agrees with Chancellor Pike.<eos> Kane doesn't.<eos> Octavia doesn't.<eos> Your people did not vote for Kane.<eos> Some of them did.
If I judge you guilty, your life is the smelter's.<eos> That is the law.<eos> Did you know what your husband was?<eos> No.<eos> Eight summers ago, I had a child with a man.<eos> He... He used to beat us.<eos> Koll saved us.<eos> He took my daughter as his own.<eos> We came back to my home, here, to Herot, but I never knew what he was.<eos> I never did!
What big threats are left?<eos> That's why Ant-Man went solo again.<eos> That's why we canceled our Avengers expansion plans.<eos> I still think we should be meeting more often.<eos> But why?<eos> Each of us are heroes with our own jobs, our own lives, our own problems to deal with.<eos> No joke. Smashing can be a full-time job.<eos> Point is, since there's nothing threatening the world right now, I'm gonna adjourn the...<eos> - Friday, do we have a gavel?<eos> - You do now.
You'd never let me go.<eos> But I swear, it wasn't me.<eos> Who did it then?<eos> I want the warlock's name.<eos> See, Jocelyn may be unreachable, but her daughter is still out there.<eos> You must want to help the girl, right?<eos> Maybe a little medicine... will trigger your memory, hmm?<eos> You have to understand, the Silent Brothers aren't like us.<eos> They lack your charm and superior people skills?<eos> Yeah, most people do.
It's the Shadowhunter creed.<eos> "Looking better in black than the widows of our enemies."<eos> My Latin's pretty rusty, but I'm almost positive that's not what that says.<eos> "For Shadowhunters, the descent into hell is easy."<eos> That should be a postcard.<eos> It's this way.<eos> I'm sorry... about what I said before about your mom.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> It's cute. You assume I have feelings.<eos> I don't.
We don't lock things.<eos> Does Mickey know you're from South Dakota?<eos> I bet she does.<eos> Did I send...<eos> What did you text?<eos> "I'm hard AF just thinking about tonight."<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> - Calm down, he's doing you a favor.<eos> Girls love that shit.<eos> No, they don't.
A player piano.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> That's playing on its own.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> That's Irma.<eos> She's, like, the resident piano-playing ghost.<eos> - Cool! - Uh-huh.<eos> Hey, let's go stalk that, uh, super excited lady.<eos> No, you should ask her to play a song.<eos> - She does anything.
Here.<eos> You flip the solenoid, saves you the trouble of rewiring it.<eos> I take it back, Raymond.<eos> You're not completely useless after all.<eos> I wanted to apologize.<eos> I'm not afraid of my past.<eos> I'm just unwilling to believe that you're my future.<eos> And the more you keep repeating that we're destined to be together, the more I want to prove you wrong.<eos> And maybe that makes me childish, and I'm... No.<eos> It doesn't.
Are you the executive officer then?<eos> Well, no, sir.<eos> That post has not yet been filled.<eos> It will be soon. Not to worry.<eos> Though Doctor Hale is most certainly the most qualified candidate.<eos> Shall we continue with the tour?<eos> Pleased to meet you both.<eos> You two have something in common, I believe.<eos> Isn't that so, Dr. hale?<eos> Yes -- yes, we do.
It is not for us to decide.<eos> I gave you explicit instruction -- every man has a right to mercy, no matter his sins.<eos> I would insist on it for any soldier.<eos> Even you, sir.<eos> He's a hospital rat, Miss Phinney.<eos> Don't be taken in.<eos> Bullen -- he sent those men after you?<eos> I'm sorry you had to find out, but it's better you know.<eos> Silas has no intention of bringing your boy to Alexandria.<eos> Never did.
After all he's-he's a dust actor!<eos> The man barely knows how to... talk!<eos> - But, people like him, right?<eos> - Yes, of course Mr. Schenk,<eos> Iagree,butIdon'tknowif Hobie Doyle, if he has the... the... the...<eos> poise in a dinner jacket.<eos> - We need an actor now, am I correct?<eos> - Yes, we do need someone pronto.<eos> - You got a better idea?<eos> - No I don't.
Fusion device.<eos> - Armageddon.<eos> - And Lockheed was there.<eos> We had a...<eos> Call for you, Mr. Mannix.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Mr. Dubrow has a telegram on a kidnapping.<eos> - He has it now?<eos> - Yes, he does.
EDWARD MANNIX HEAD OF PHYSICAL PRODUCTION<eos> Natalie, could you please get me Stu Schwartz, Accounting?<eos> Stu Schwartz on two.<eos> - Stu, how are you?<eos> - Good, Eddie.<eos> - I need some petty cash. - Okay.<eos> - A hundred thousand.<eos> - A hundred thousand?<eos> - I'm sorry, did I say "petty"?<eos> - You did.
So, I black out, I wake up here and I say to myself,<eos> Baird,yougottostop doingthis, but you're saying, actually, technically I was kidnapped.<eos> Well... technically, yes.<eos> - And there's gonna be a ransom.<eos> - I'd hardly call it a "ransom."<eos> Benedict there, that's Benedict de Bonaventure, he wrote "The House of Ahasuaris."<eos> Enormous hit.<eos> Made the studio millions of dollars.<eos> Did you see any of those millions of dollars, Ben?<eos> I did not.
Some new kids were just about to give me a chance.<eos> Don't try anything new, son.<eos> I could've married a woman who didn't look exactly like me.<eos> But that would've been crazy.<eos> Hey, newbie.<eos> Nobody touches the new James Patterson until Solar reads it first.<eos> She wants you to pick it up.<eos> You scared, huh?<eos> Whoa. Anybody else want a taste of Blue Thunder?<eos> Uh, I do.
No, I said I was Dr. Ronald Fishman.<eos> And I'm the legendary Butch Ryder.<eos> But don't you think maybe somebody here might know those guys for real?<eos> We don't even look like 'em.<eos> What do they look like?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, he's got tattoos.<eos> You have to get those exact same tattoos as Butch.<eos> I do, do I?
- I already told the FBI to be standing by in anticipation of your order.<eos> I'll confirm.<eos> What the hell is his strategy?<eos> He knows we're not gonna give up the hunt just because he closes.<eos> Maybe he wants to quit while he's ahead.<eos> No one quits while they're ahead.<eos> This isn't France. It's America.<eos> We think noblesse oblige is a new entrée at Olive Garden.<eos> You know, there's a book that could help you with that. Sarno?<eos> It didn't.
Made millions out of an app she created at uni.<eos> Damien Lamerat's girlfriend funds DJM.<eos> That sounds like a conflict of interest.<eos> No wonder Reece Dexter isn't happy.<eos> You speak to her. I'll talk to the McCordells.<eos> I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> I have to ask... Did you know about Aiden's decision to leave the team?<eos> Yes. He told me this morning.<eos> And did you know he'd signed for Ravonsdale?<eos> No. I didn't.
It was the first ever race.<eos> Nobody really knew what we were doing.<eos> Looking back, we just weren't ready.<eos> I had a plan for which roads could be opened up if we needed to.<eos> But so many more people came than we were expecting.<eos> We had no idea.<eos> I know all of this from the investigation.<eos> I know you had to open some of the roads, but not that one.<eos> Judith opened the wrong one.<eos> No, she didn't.
If you just tell them you've been a foolish girl, then they'll let you come home.<eos> Please!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't.<eos> Daddy?<eos> I've got a small confession to make...<eos> Daddy?<eos> Good afternoon, the police please.<eos> - He begged me to forgive him.<eos> - And did you?
One more time?<eos> It ain't locked.<eos> Well, how about that?<eos> The law of averages.<eos> Yep.<eos> Let's get this thing going, grab our gear, come back for the car later.<eos> Take another way back.<eos> See what we can see.<eos> Think it'll start?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hey, enough.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You've got a life back there, and maybe I will, too, but before I can even think about that, I need to take care of something.<eos> I have to try.<eos> So let me help you.<eos> You can't.<eos> Carl?<eos> I thought I saw her that night.<eos> I thought I did.<eos> I did.
My people are in trouble.<eos> They don't... we don't have a lot of fighters.<eos> I know how it looks, but I'll play it out.<eos> Can I borrow a gun?<eos> No.<eos> We got tracks right here.<eos> They gotta be in there.<eos> We moving in or what?<eos> How do we know this ain't firecrackers in a trash can?<eos> You don't.
We need things.<eos> What, are you gonna give us a bottle of aspirin and a box of bullets?<eos> Our communities can help each other.<eos> Thank you, Natalie.<eos> Been a good talk.<eos> We can help each other.<eos> We're doing fine.<eos> Are you?<eos> We want to generate trade.<eos> Gregory does.
You will.<eos> You know what? I'm not so sure.<eos> We'd be taking most of the risk, not getting much in the way of a reward.<eos> The other option won't work out for you.<eos> We'll take our chances.<eos> You don't have to do this. You don't have to fight.<eos> Your people killed all of my people.<eos> Of course we gotta fight.<eos> - We didn't want to.<eos> - But you did.
She was there for us.<eos> I didn't mean to bring it up.<eos> No, it's just...<eos> I just keep thinking about Tara, when she finds out.<eos> Hey, everything's gonna be okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is good.<eos> Mm, it is.<eos> Jesus came through.<eos> They all did.
Or she could've died here, even if she isn't here.<eos> Trail goes this way.<eos> They were close to Alexandria.<eos> There's even more of them.<eos> We didn't end it.<eos> No.<eos> You started something.<eos> That's where she died.<eos> All right, so he had to start from here.<eos> He did.
No.<eos> You started something.<eos> That's where she died.<eos> All right, so he had to start from here.<eos> He did.<eos> Which way did Dwight run?<eos> Rosita?<eos> We should let him do this.<eos> But he doesn't know what he's doing.<eos> We don't.
I can't.<eos> - Daryl.<eos> - Man, I can't!<eos> I can't either.<eos> Thing is, those men could be back in Alexandria right now.<eos> If they are, they're dead.<eos> I hope not.<eos> We need them alive.<eos> We need to find out more.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Hey, congrats on getting Steve Birch.<eos> That's a solid double.<eos> Axelrod... that's bigger.<eos> You speaking for the Attorney General or is this off the cuff?<eos> I speak for everyone.<eos> It's fundraising season.<eos> The administration needs Wall Street money to compete.<eos> Nobody wants this to look like some kind of crusade.<eos> I'm doing my job. I don't think about what it looks like.<eos> Well, the AG does.
And I'm not gonna tell you I'm here for my patients or because I love my job, even though I do love my job.<eos> And your collection of insecure egomaniacs would lose a billion a year if I didn't keep their heads straight.<eos> And I am not going to tell you I'm here spying for Chuck, Because you know that's total fucking nonsense.<eos> The answer... My answer is, I'm here for me.<eos> Because I built this company just as much as you did.<eos> That's a bold statement.<eos> That's a true statement.<eos> I put you back together again when your whole world burned.<eos> And I found meaning in that.<eos> I still do.
You'll land on a private strip on private land.<eos> Then I can't see myself running the piece tonight.<eos> Yummy.<eos> This is yummy.<eos> For years, I couldn't eat tripe. I thought I could still smell the shit in it.<eos> Then I hypnotized him out of it. - Mm.<eos> You going for hypnotism now, Nancy?<eos> - Oh. - Huh? - It only works on him.<eos> I stare into his eyes, he locks in on me... and we will the change.<eos> Work it does.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He's better off dead.<eos> We'd all be better off dead.<eos> We won't have long to wait.<eos> Another month, winter will come, and we'll freeze in these mountains.<eos> They need us for this railroad.<eos> No, they don't.
I don't talk about them and you can't.<eos> No exceptions.<eos> Given we are a new branch of science, there's no standard scale for fees, so I charge 10 shillings per session.<eos> As much as a visit to a halfway-decent dentist.<eos> So you can come see me or get your teeth fixed.<eos> Your choice.<eos> Why are you scratching your hand?<eos> Why were you doing that?<eos> I had an itch.<eos> No, you didn't.
I know, I know.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm not just doing this for Vincent.<eos> I'm doing this for us, too.<eos> 'Cause the sooner I can help figure out who's after him, the sooner I can focus on packing.<eos> And I think the bossy blouse is perfect, Captain.<eos> You didn't think I was listening, did you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
I don't think I need to tell you, but with this Braga fight you're gonna have to get focused and cut out all this bullshit in your life.<eos> At least until after the fight.<eos> You need to pick apart his flaws and plan a strategy that he can't help but fall into.<eos> Brody?<eos> Brody.<eos> Come on, man. Do you not want this anymore?<eos> If you don't, it's okay, man.<eos> Just be honest with yourself.<eos> I want this fight, Case.<eos> I do.
Don't make me crush you.<eos> So, this recovers lost memories?<eos> But it's a dangerous procedure on a healthy subject.<eos> And Werner's anything but.<eos> Anoxic brain trauma.<eos> Prefrontal cortex is barely active.<eos> But memories are backed up in other areas, as well, traces and images tucked throughout the brain.<eos> Just need to dig them out.<eos> You have a problem with this?<eos> Because I do.
- How?<eos> - You sold me out!<eos> Tell me how.<eos> Dad said only as a last resort.<eos> Perizad sent me.<eos> We went to Princeton together.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I didn't have anywhere else to turn.<eos> I didn't know where else to turn.<eos> And now we do.
It's time.<eos> Time for the apocalypse of justice.<eos> Mindhorn.<eos> Please, no.<eos> Look into my eyes.<eos> - Can you see the truth?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did you receive the evidence I sent to your house?<eos> - Yes, definitely.<eos> - You did?
Whereabouts at Pat's?<eos> In the garage.<eos> In the glove compartment of the Mindhorn car.<eos> - What have you got the gun for?<eos> - You know too much, Richard.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> I'm actually quite confused.<eos> You know that I killed Moncrief, right?<eos> I did not know that.<eos> Well, you do now.
This abomination will never ascend.<eos> Kill him.<eos> He's right.<eos> We need him.<eos> For Lexa.<eos> Announce my ascension.<eos> You don't have the Flame, Ontari.<eos> Don't talk to me as if I'm a fool, Roan.<eos> No one knows that.<eos> He does.
Previously in "The 100"...<eos> Let the people know they have a new Commander.<eos> You don't have the Flame, Ontari.<eos> - No one knows that.<eos> - He does.
The ambassadors don't get to judge me, and neither do you!<eos> Ok. You're right.<eos> You're right. We don't.<eos> No one does, and we can use that.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Roan. He's got you doing everything wrong.<eos> - You're hiding.<eos> - I'm not hiding.<eos> I'm waiting for him to return with the Flame.<eos> And what if he doesn't?
You can't have it.<eos> Hey, get off me!<eos> Get off me!<eos> No!<eos> Jaha, don't do this.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Don't do it.<eos> Monty?<eos> We got here first.<eos> No, we didn't.
Why would you think you could do this?<eos> Because I saw it come out of the last Commander.<eos> Don't ask.<eos> So what do you do for her now?<eos> She's taken a liking to me.<eos> Who could blame her?<eos> Go.<eos> What?<eos> Heda requires your presence, Flame Keeper.<eos> Of course she does.
Now!<eos> I'm sure all of you will be glad to know that we are officially done talking about Earth skills.<eos> Oh, great. In that case...<eos> Sit down.<eos> How would you feel about assisting me with today's lesson, Mr. Murphy?<eos> Sign me up.<eos> What the hell was that fo...<eos> - Oh, jeez.<eos> I know all about you, John Murphy.<eos> - Ah, you do, huh?
I believe everyone deserves a second chance, but taking him with us on a covert mission doesn't seem like the place to test it.<eos> It's a crazy world out there, full of powered people.<eos> I finally have one of my own.<eos> I don't leave home without him.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> He doesn't go, I don't go.<eos> Fine.<eos> We'll go without you.<eos> We don't need him.<eos> Actually, we do.
Those sticky strips for your nose?<eos> Yes, but those don't work for me because the problem isn't my nose.<eos> It's my uvula.<eos> I have an abnormally large uvula.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Larry snored.<eos> I used to stick books under the top of his side of the mattress so his head would stay elevated.<eos> - And that worked?<eos> - Not really.<eos> But half an Ativan did.
So we're looking for a 'man of soot' talking to a rabbit.<eos> Did the medium tell you anything else that would make you think she's credible?<eos> She impressed me.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Darlin', give us a kiss, right?<eos> He's definitely sooty enough.<eos> And he's definitely flush.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> If he has something to hide, I imagine he'll run.<eos> And if he doesn't?
Don't forget what I'm doing for you.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> You can serve yourself, I'm not fucking hungry.<eos> But I told you, didn't I?<eos> This is the way that it works.<eos> It's two, three passes at it.<eos> It's a cycle, I said at the beginning.<eos> - I'm not doing it again.<eos> - But you've got no choice.<eos> I do.
This way, please.<eos> Gloves are a nice touch.<eos> Didn't want to scratch my hand.<eos> You mean you didn't want me to see you scratching your hand.<eos> The gloves are to remind you but the itch is still there.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I record my sessions for later review, saves taking notes.<eos> I've never heard my own voice.<eos> You wouldn't like it.<eos> No one does.
We cancelled that program a long time ago.<eos> Last question.<eos> Are you going to resign?<eos> That parakeet again!<eos> Do you really think a disabled person...<eos> Shut up!<eos> No, I take it back!<eos> Ask me one last question!<eos> They'll have us for lunch!<eos> Do something, sir.
But if you don't trust me... Jace! Alec!<eos> I think I found it!<eos> Mary Milligan!<eos> Beloved servant?<eos> Who wants that on a headstone?<eos> Someone who is in service to a cause greater than themselves.<eos> At least she is now.<eos> Abracadabra.<eos> Wait, you people actually say that?<eos> No, Clary, we don't.
Right.<eos> I don't know what the hell you are, angel doll, but you're one tasty treat.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Would you like to help me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Anything.<eos> Could you tell me where to find the Mortal Cup?<eos> I wish I could... but I don't know.<eos> Clary knows.<eos> No, she doesn't.
- No, I think we're good.<eos> - Chop-chop.<eos> I have to say, I have never encountered someone like you.<eos> - Oh, why, thank you.<eos> - Someone who has the ability to spout absolute nonsense with such ease.<eos> It's not nonsense. It's the truth.<eos> Bobbi and I were on holiday, picking mushrooms ...<eos> In the woods of Siberia in the dead of Winter.<eos> Do you know a better place to find the jumbo chaga mushroom?<eos> Because I certainly do not.
We have three bodies that someone must answer for.<eos> How did you and Ms. Morse get into the country? There are no records of you flying into Russia.<eos> Where were you when S.H.I.E.L.D. fell?<eos> If you are tourists, where are you staying?<eos> What hotel?<eos> Multiple witnesses saw you pull the trigger.<eos> Do you deny this?<eos> Your first victim.<eos> - Why did you kill him?<eos> - I didn't.
It's time.<eos> I'll have your things sent to you.<eos> And frankly, you should be more careful when making your vacation plans next time.<eos> We are so sorry, sir.<eos> - It's all yours, Inspector.<eos> So, you do not work for S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> - I do not.<eos> - Doesn't exist anymore.<eos> And you're telling me they don't work - for any U.S. government agency.<eos> - No. They do not.
The drums are ready, almost there.<eos> The end is stuck.<eos> 20 seconds.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> I thought you said I had 20 seconds.<eos> The water must have collapsed the circuit.<eos> You could've told me.<eos> I would've run faster.<eos> Chadmont, your buddy Nader almost triggered a nuclear disaster.<eos> No, he didn't.
Well, why cut his heart out, then put his shirt back on?<eos> Dressing can be a form of remorse.<eos> But then, that contradicts the brutality in which he kills.<eos> Which then speaks to it being a compulsion or part of his ritual.<eos> The weighting and the dumping of the body could be a forensic countermeasure?<eos> It suggests that he's done this before.<eos> So, potentially, there are more victims in the water.<eos> We need to drag the bay, asap.<eos> I'm sorry, Jack, I don't have those kind of resources.<eos> Well, I do actually.
I'll have to check the records.<eos> Uncle John..what are you doing here?<eos> I am looking for.. Still looking for a property for your son-in-law.<eos> We needed some information about the Shah family.<eos> But they are settled in USA.<eos> It's been more than 25 years.<eos> I handle all their paperwork.<eos> It's not easy to deal with the NRIs.<eos> But we had heard that they.. ..Donated a part of their property to the lmambara.<eos> Yes, they did.
It was a... it was a long meeting.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Look, I can't promise I won't do it again, but what I can promise is that I won't--<eos> You need to shut up now.<eos> - Mm. - Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> You're gonna shut off your brain... and breathe into your body.<eos> - Close your eyes... relax... and let me do all the work.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I thought you cut the throttle cable.<eos> I did.
-Fine.<eos> Who's Edgar Brass?<eos> Drug-dealing butcher who's worse by a mile.<eos> They send me after him, I'm as good as dead.<eos> I get it, I do, but chances are, the Feds are gonna ask for the same thing.<eos> Why Grotto?<eos> Because we know your client has worked with Brass before.<eos> You got an in.<eos> If he could get Brass to talk, he would be instrumental in taking down a major drug ring.<eos> If I don't?
You know where we stand then.<eos> Maybe you should do some counseling, Counselor.<eos> Hopefully before I change my mind.<eos> This is not a deal you walk away from.<eos> Not alive, no.<eos> You get them Brass and they get you away from the psychopath hunting you.<eos> It ain't just him.<eos> What if it's Brass puts a bullet in me?<eos> What if the Irish got wind I'm doing this?<eos> They didn't.
More leaders like Doris Jones.<eos> And when she retires at the end of this term, I'm delighted to say that her daughter, Celia, will run for the open seat to continue delivering just like her mother has.<eos> No fucking way.<eos> And I, for one, will support your candidacy with everything I've got. And I know Claire will, as well.<eos> Texans are tenacious.<eos> I'm proud to be married to one, and I'm proud to have served with one, like Congresswoman Jones.<eos> Thank you, Doris, for all your years of service, and thank you, Celia, for picking up the mantle.<eos> Doris said her daughter spoke out of turn, that she didn't know about the deal she was brokering with Underwood.<eos> Did you connect with LeAnn?<eos> No, I didn't.
without Ms. Wesley's direct involvement?<eos> No, it wouldn't.<eos> I thank you for your honesty.<eos> No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Endler, do you wish to redirect?<eos> No, Your Honor.<eos> You may step down, Ms. Thawley.<eos> Why do they look so angry?<eos> Because they think we lied to them.<eos> But we didn't.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a decision?<eos> We have, Your Honor.<eos> And how do you find?<eos> We, the jury, find in favor of Grace Wesley.<eos> We are adjourned.<eos> Nice shoes.<eos> Grace, I'm sorry.<eos> I couldn't tell you. It had to come as a surprise, otherwise the jury wouldn't have been swayed by your reactions.<eos> So, you did have a plan.<eos> No, you did.
Because I might be able to set you up.<eos> Why didn't you want to be interviewed?<eos> You saved all those people.<eos> I need to get back to Kansas.<eos> Gotta get back to little Gil.<eos> I promised him I'd be home.<eos> I wasn't there enough for Matt growing up.<eos> - I don't want to make the same mistake.<eos> - He turned out just fine.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Yeah, it's the first piece of furniture we put into the new place.<eos> Hanna wouldn't let go of it.<eos> - Caleb?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Um, I can't find any wine glasses.<eos> You wanna go check the pantry for me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nice.<eos> So do you and Caleb see much of each other in DC?<eos> Uh, yeah, we do.
Thank you, Heavenly Father for this healing food and these dear friends and thank you to all those who are working tirelessly to seek justice for Charlotte.<eos> And thank you for helping the police find Charlotte's killer and anyone who could be protecting him or her.<eos> Thank you always for your guidance and love. Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> That was awkward.<eos> Was that speech directed at us?<eos> Not at us but... Aria maybe.<eos> Why would Ali think that Aria had anything to do with Charlotte's death?<eos> Maybe she did.
- Right?<eos> - Here you go, ladies.<eos> Let me know if you need anything else.<eos> You know, honey, if you're worried about paying for it you shouldn't be.<eos> Dad left you all that money for exactly this reason and you can just take out a loan for the rest.<eos> You know, all the work you're doing the person you've become your dad would be really proud of you, Emmy.<eos> Hey.<eos> I wasn't expecting anyone.<eos> I thought you went back to Boston.<eos> I did.
Yeah.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> He told me he went home afterwards.<eos> But... I don't know. He-he was so angry.<eos> - Aria, what is it?<eos> - I know him. And I know that Ezra can't look me in the eye when he lies.<eos> And when he told me he went home, he didn't... Look at me.<eos> Well, we have to tell someone.<eos> - Lorenzo, Ali, anyone.<eos> - No, we don't.
What was the only regret that escaped his lips at the end of his pathetic life?<eos> That the people of Mongolia allowed the fat fuck of a thief Kublai to steal the election with impunity.<eos> Something you'd like to say to me, bastard?<eos> My father was rightfully elected.<eos> Your mouth was barely dry of your whore mother's tit during the last Kurultai.<eos> Good shot, Arban.<eos> We'll be home behind a wall soon.<eos> Then he will be in someone else's safekeeping.<eos> You said you didn't choose this place.<eos> - I didn't.
Put yourself in their circumstances and practice kindness from that day forward.<eos> That is it?<eos> It will change your karma now.<eos> Or many lifetimes from now.<eos> -Hello, Empress Chabi. -Oh!<eos> Hello, my Princess Ling Ling.<eos> - Am I still a princess?<eos> - Of course you are.<eos> Master Ahmad says I may marry a prince one day.<eos> Does he now?
We were riding once in the Tetons, and there was this rockslide up ahead, and her horse bucked ...<eos> And my heart stopped.<eos> But she got up and...<eos> calmed that horse in a way that made me more proud than anything I'd ever done.<eos> And that was the day I told her about Hydra. - Brought her into the fold.<eos> - Where's Stephanie now, Gideon?<eos> I was foolish.<eos> I thought that I could bring back the Hydra and guide it the same way Stephanie commanded that horse.<eos> I taught her to have faith in it as a god.<eos> And she did.
Don't play prince charming now, please.<eos> We're grown-ups, Gabriel.<eos> You had your chance to be with me and you left me.<eos> You left me because you're unable to risk anything.<eos> You're an indifferent apathetic stupid who was brainwashed by his mom.<eos> -What?<eos> -Your mommy!<eos> That old bag hated me for not being one of her polo club friends' daughter!<eos> -My mom didn't think that.<eos> -Yes, she did!
-Helping you do what?<eos> -To become famous, like Paris Hilton.<eos> Are you sick or what?<eos> Get dressed, Nicolás!<eos> We all know you're a dinosaur, and no matter how hard you try, you won't understand our stuff, so why don't you leave?<eos> Listen, Nicolás.<eos> It is you who don't understand.<eos> You haven't noticed that not even your mom loves you?<eos> -My mom loves me.<eos> -No, she doesn't!
"The other 1%" is such a good hashtag.<eos> The New Orleans police put out a call to...<eos> -Hi!<eos> My name is Brook...<eos> -Look and I was wondering if--<eos> Take your picture or smash an egg in my face, or whatever you need to do for you and your friends to get your jollies.<eos> -But spare me the setup, all right?<eos> -I don't have a setup.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> Yeah, I do, actually.
This is to make you feel better about that... pardon my French, miss, bullshit you pulled.<eos> -Okay, Joe, let's go.<eos> -The bullshit I pulled?<eos> I work three jobs.<eos> This is the good one.<eos> O'Neill?<eos> I heard he had kidney stones.<eos> But no health insurance.<eos> So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.<eos> It didn't.
They found you!<eos> We have to move the body!<eos> Shut up.<eos> We cannot move the body.<eos> There's drones.<eos> Stop it, Lolly.<eos> We cannot move it.<eos> If I told you I already moved it, would it calm you down?<eos> Maybe for a minute.<eos> Good, 'cause I did.
Wow, I guess he didn't die in the vending machine.<eos> What? ! It's over?<eos> !<eos> Should we put in the next one?<eos> Of course we should.<eos> We are binge-watching this whole show.<eos> I mean, I haven't been this into something since The Shawshank Redemption.<eos> Yes, um, after you escaped into the hole, how did you perfectly re-attach the Raquel Welch poster from inside the hole with a tautness that a rock could pierce?<eos> Does it really matter?<eos> It does to me.
Why are you doing this?<eos> To prove a point.<eos> Here's to crime.<eos> You see, I have a reason, a good one.<eos> I have to prove myself...<eos> As a husband and a father.<eos> I mean, well, this isn't the sort of thing I'd agree to do normally, without an important reason.<eos> Of course.<eos> Did I ever tell you I started out as a lab assistant?<eos> Of course, I did, right?
That's not possible.<eos> I would never.<eos> I...<eos> I love Her Majesty.<eos> And I...<eos> I would never harm anyone.<eos> I can't even imagine wanting to.<eos> Please.<eos> You must believe me.<eos> Oh, I do, Mr. Balfour.
I would never.<eos> I...<eos> I love Her Majesty.<eos> And I...<eos> I would never harm anyone.<eos> I can't even imagine wanting to.<eos> Please.<eos> You must believe me.<eos> Oh, I do, Mr. Balfour.<eos> I most certainly do.
- he's staying, Sarah?<eos> - For a while.<eos> At least until Steve is done writing.<eos> Who made this incredible lasagna?<eos> He made the pasta from scratch.<eos> It tastes much better than what you get in the store.<eos> You have been on such a cooking jag lately, sweetie.<eos> - I find it meditative.<eos> - I find eating meditative.<eos> Of course you do.
- Nor you the opposite.<eos> Let's look at it backwards.<eos> Hello.<eos> Wouldn't the pieces fit if you'd taken the initiative in all of this?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Calling the police.<eos> Listen, it wasn't our fault, it was the damn deer.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> - What if he saw something?<eos> - He didn't.
No.<eos> It's a warning.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> Someone's got to tell her about Hayden.<eos> No.<eos> Somebody doesn't have to be you.<eos> All right, especially looking like this.<eos> I mean, what if they think you killed her?<eos> Maybe I did.<eos> You didn't.
Scott.<eos> That guy's not moving at all.<eos> Look...<eos> Help me.<eos> It's a trap.<eos> Please...<eos> You can't help him.<eos> That's big.<eos> No one said it was that big.<eos> I did.
You can make yourself invisible... You're fast.<eos> You're strong.<eos> People like me need people like you to save our asses.<eos> I need you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You're too smart to need anyone.<eos> And it's the smart ones who always survive.<eos> Then survive with me.<eos> Look, Scott's going to have a plan.<eos> They always do.
Set.<eos> This is a good start.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> How is Parrish dead?<eos> He's a body.<eos> A means to an end.<eos> I am beyond life and death.<eos> I am infinite.<eos> I have no use for your Deputy.<eos> But we do.
Your name is Hayden.<eos> Melissa...<eos> Melissa!<eos> Malia.<eos> Come down.<eos> Don't listen to her.<eos> I'm not going to stop, Malia.<eos> I'm taking back what you stole from me.<eos> I didn't steal anything.<eos> But you did.
They suck.<eos> What are you talkin' about?<eos> Your back shots.<eos> Which suck.<eos> I must've been thinkin' of someone else.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe someone else who should be Captain?<eos> We'll make it.<eos> Well, guess we have to go now.<eos> No, we don't.
I am.<eos> I'm Lydia Martin.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Should I?<eos> Hey, Mr. Stilinski, we're looking for somebody who might be named Stiles.<eos> You went by that name in the Army, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Best years of my life.<eos> Do you know any of us?<eos> Of course I do.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Uh, whoever updated my calendar didn't, uh, include your contact info, so I wasn't...<eos> Couldn't call me to tell me that you're late for our lunch?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Though I guess I could have called the restaurant.<eos> Yeah, umm, so, so somebody else updates your calendar for you?<eos> Uh, yeah. There's a campaign aide in charge of coordinating.<eos> That's probably who you talked to, to schedule.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Umm, yes, I did.
Mona left him sitting on the bench.<eos> Couple minutes later he got up and went inside.<eos> You didn't hear anything that she said to him?<eos> No, I was too far away.<eos> But what is Mona doing with Sara's driver?<eos> Well, I doubt she's asking him for a ride to the airport.<eos> It was a meeting of the minions.<eos> Yeah, could be.<eos> Did he go in there with that tube?<eos> No, he didn't.
It was your idea actually.<eos> You needed proof about the Lotus, I needed proof about my dad.<eos> You set a trap for him as a test.<eos> Unrestricted access to Palmer Technologies' RD lab.<eos> He flunked with flying colors.<eos> I don't even know why I'm surprised.<eos> You're surprised because you're hoping that he's the parent you've always wanted him to be, the parent you deserve.<eos> In an extremely ironic role reversal, my mother was smarter than me.<eos> She said, "People don't change, no matter how much you want them to."<eos> Some people don't.
I have found my purpose.<eos> What is yours in Japan?<eos> I've come for the lotus.<eos> It is my responsibility to keep it safe.<eos> I know.<eos> Unfortunate.<eos> We're evenly matched.<eos> One of us must yield or this will go on for ages.<eos> I have nowhere else to be.<eos> I do.
Hey.<eos> And this is Samantha, William's mother.<eos> She's a friend, a hero in Detroit they call Vixen.<eos> Mari and I had an animated encounter last year, and we've stayed in touch ever since.<eos> How are you gonna help me find my son?<eos> With magic.<eos> Magic.<eos> Yeah. It's a long story, but the short version is that this totem gives me the ability to channel the ashe-- or the spirit-- of any animal.<eos> Do you have anything of William's with you?<eos> Yes, I do.
Malcolm Merlyn reached out, gave me an early birthday present.<eos> It would be a shame not to make use of it.<eos> Ah! My buddies!<eos> Let's get the rest of the organization on the line.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I am giddy to report that phase 4 is proceeding on schedule.<eos> There's still some concern about the Star City operation.<eos> Enlighten me.<eos> Phase 5 requires control over city hall, yet somehow we've found ourselves mired in a petty political race to see that happen.<eos> We didn't exactly plan on Oliver Queen, did we?<eos> No one ever does.
I am--<eos> Going to go work on your debate prep?<eos> Debate prep. Just took the words right out of my mouth.<eos> This man deserves to die.<eos> He tortured us!<eos> And he saved me.<eos> At great risk to himself, he kept me alive.<eos> I have more reason than anyone to hate this man, but he's our best chance of going home.<eos> He killed your brother.<eos> Yes, he did.
I mean, but it's pretty cutting edge, so I can't promise anything.<eos> You're telling me that this little piece of technology's gonna help me walk again?<eos> After it's implanted in your spine, yes.<eos> He's been trying to crack it for a while, but he needed a power source, something that would last a lifetime.<eos> Palmer Technologies' power cell.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Once I solved that, I knew this might actually work.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I do.
Lance is getting the word out. He assigned a protective detail.<eos> I'm gonna run forensics on this.<eos> We're gonna hit the streets, see if we can get a line on Cutter.<eos> OK. You want to talk about the other obvious problem?<eos> Yeah, the, uh, elephant in the room.<eos> Felicity and I are fine.<eos> Yeah, well, if you were listening to her little asides, you would know that was not true.<eos> John--heh heh--you were the one who told me to give her time.<eos> OK. Do you want to get back together with her?<eos> I do.
Merlyn's men saw you fighting for your team.<eos> Darhk's now gonna know that I'm on your side.<eos> I'm a dead man.<eos> I mean, he's just not gonna stop with me.<eos> He's gonna come for you, he's gonna come for Lyla, Sara.<eos> Listen. He's not gonna come for anybody. Ok?<eos> He can't.<eos> Merlyn has the idol. Look.<eos> He's probably delivering it to him right now. No, Andy.<eos> No, he doesn't.
You keep people safe. What about Darhk?<eos> Darhk's mine.<eos> What are you going to do now, Oliver?<eos> Stop the posturing.<eos> We both know that you can't do it.<eos> You spared the life of the man who killed your mother.<eos> And you killed a friend of mine.<eos> You killed tens of thousands of innocent people.<eos> With Slade Wilson, I had a choice.<eos> This time, I don't.
JOE: I think that belongs to me.<eos> I'm sorry you had to find out this way.<eos> Okay.<eos> You won't tell anyone, will you?<eos> No.<eos> You can tell people.<eos> Hey, so how was the spa?<eos> Oh, it was fine, though I don't know why they made us face each other during the mother-daughter bikini wax.<eos> Did you two have a nice afternoon?<eos> Sure did.
But you didn't stop treating others?<eos> So...how's your Juliet?<eos> Did you kiss her yet or not?<eos> - Let it be, uncle.<eos> Why should I tell her?<eos> - So what?<eos> No need to be shy.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I'll be really happy if you kissed her.<eos> You did...didn't you?
An hour ago?<eos> And you just... kept me down here this whole time?<eos> Well, you needed to rest.<eos> I needed to be up there, helping, not locked down here like some prisoner!<eos> Your immune system is completely shut down!<eos> Anyone so much as sneezes, and it might kill you.<eos> So until you've fully recovered, you are a prisoner... you're my prisoner.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I just don't know what to do.<eos> None of us do.

You were right to trust me.<eos> I'm finished with S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> And actually, I have answers.<eos> The DNA you need... I have it.<eos> Inhuman DNA is not enough.<eos> We needed to drain actual Kree blood.<eos> Which is what I have pumping through my veins.<eos> Coulson used it to bring me back after Quinn shot me.<eos> Ward should remember.<eos> He does.
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'. Ridin' round with that Nina.<eos> Ridin' round with that AK.<eos> It's his song.<eos> I'm just gonna be...<eos> Well, that's fan-fucking-tastic, Charlie. How'd you do it?<eos> I promised him a multi-million dollar licensing deal with Mobilo Tech.<eos> Elaborate.<eos> First of all, this app doesn't suck.<eos> You see, most smart phones don't seamlessly block... all of your unwanted calls or texts.<eos> This app does.
Then why are you even here?<eos> Because I wanted to check on you.<eos> I don't need you to check on me!<eos> Uber got my back. I'm fine.<eos> Adios, Eva.<eos> Where the hell is he?<eos> Hey, Kareem.<eos> - Yes, sir?<eos> - We're waiting, like, 20 minutes. Does Charlie know the meeting time?<eos> Uh, yes, sir, he does.
Those Nano-Parasites can consume human flesh upon contact, but when they make contact with Inhumans, they attack the pleasure centers of the brain, giving its victims a desire and willingness to connect with Hive and to serve him.<eos> So he's controlling Daisy. Is that it?<eos> That's it.<eos> This is exactly why the Sokovia Accords were created.<eos> This is a nightmare scenario.<eos> She's a nuclear weapon in the wrong hands.<eos> How many of these Inhumans is he controlling?<eos> Not many.<eos> He tried to create his own, but we rained on that parade.<eos> We did.
You do not understand.<eos> Understand what?<eos> It's my fault.<eos> All of it.<eos> My love's entrapment.<eos> Then, and now.<eos> It was I who told the human servants long ago of the Emblem's power.<eos> To make them feel safe in our alliance.<eos> I never thought they would use it against him.<eos> But they did.
- Dave.<eos> Uh, Ian.<eos> His name's Ian.<eos> You look young, Ian.<eos> You still in high school?<eos> No, he, uh--<eos> I dropped out.<eos> Joined the army.<eos> Since when does the US Army accept high school dropouts?<eos> They don't.
-No.<eos> -Will you give me a hint?<eos> It's the name of their favorite television show.<eos> I don't know, Trapper John, M.D.<eos> -I'm coming in.<eos> Move over.<eos> -It was Zig and Sharko.<eos> -Well, I was close.<eos> -I would've thought you knew that.<eos> I do.
We validate, but OK.<eos> The hand dryer in the men's room does not work.<eos> Like, at all.<eos> I'd like to introduce my legal counsel, Nwabudike Douglas Bergstein.<eos> Yes, I'm familiar with your son, who I grew up with.<eos> -Hello, Budlas. -Oh.<eos> Oh, we're bringing Budlas back?<eos> OK, well, then, hello, Brianna-donna-ding-dong.<eos> - Never caught on.<eos> - At my house it did.
Because, uh, you didn't call me to come help with the kids.<eos> Mom, Jean jumped on a plane.<eos> Huh, and, uh, you told your father first that you were pregnant.<eos> To cheer him up.<eos> I was dying to tell you, Mom.<eos> I called you.<eos> And left a message with no hint of any news.<eos> I didn't want to tell you in a message.<eos> Well, you know something, it felt... like you didn't really want to tell me at all.<eos> Mom, of course I did.
Tachyons!<eos> 87th and Avenue J.<eos> Must be one of Mercury Labs' off-site facilities.<eos> Hack into their se...<eos> I've hacked in the security feed.<eos> - And once that...<eos> Barry, hurry up!<eos> It's charged.<eos> You said you'd release me.<eos> Yes, I did. Didn't I?
Like I said, I've been through it.<eos> I've hit bottom.<eos> I know what it's like to be so addicted to something that you'd do anything to get her back.<eos> Hive and his worker bees will be down here any second.<eos> - And then?<eos> - Even if we could steal the warhead, it's probably on a timer by now, timed with their ascent.<eos> I don't suppose you came with any concrete ideas.<eos> I have one. Coulson's gonna need your help.<eos> I don't know what he's planning, but ...<eos> - I do.
Five of them, in fact.<eos> All hanging in the pit.<eos> Have you found the words on the wall?<eos> "Laudate eum."<eos> "Praise Him."<eos> I cut them there with a stone when I was in this cell. Like you.<eos> Be quiet. Don't...<eos> Don't speak to me.<eos> You have no right to speak to me.<eos> I do.
Everybody knows there are no leaders at Rebirth, because only you can change your life.<eos> But...<eos> But we all know who that spark was.<eos> Zack 110 percent changed Kyle's life.<eos> And mine too.<eos> In the old days, people were afraid something horrible would happen to them.<eos> Now they're afraid nothing will happen to them.<eos> If Zack hadn't come into my life when he did...<eos> I really don't like to think about it.<eos> I really don't.
And the worms eat you, just know it was I who took everything from you.<eos> - Here. - Where's my stuff?<eos> Your bag's over there.<eos> I figured, after what you did, I'd better get you out before the Mikaelsons came back to hurt you.<eos> You mean like you hurt me?<eos> I asked you to do one thing for me.<eos> To believe in me.<eos> To choose my side.<eos> I asked you to choose me.<eos> But you didn't.
That's not your decision to make!<eos> Control yourself.<eos> Unless you can't.<eos> It's worse than I remember.<eos> The rage.<eos> The hunger.<eos> I'd like to blame my anger on Finn, but it's been growing worse since I came back.<eos> I never did learn how to keep it in check.<eos> I never really cared to.<eos> But now you do.
None of your business.<eos> All right? There is nothing for me here.<eos> Kol... you know that's not true.<eos> Your family...<eos> Do not lecture me about family, sister, or not.<eos> Now, you may have spent your entire life searching for us, but I never, for a second, wanted you.<eos> There's something strange going on in this city.<eos> I can't put my finger on it, but I need to know what it is.<eos> "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."<eos> Unless it don't.
No lines at the DMV, no hangovers, got the abs of the laborer I once was, and the cuticles of a real housewife, and I can quite literally hear your eyes roll from across the room.<eos> - Am I boring you?<eos> - No... just wondering why you had your friends bring me here if you were just gonna pick out man jewelry.<eos> I requested your company for a progress update, 'cause I am still waiting for you to get me access to the Mikaelson home.<eos> It's not magic keeping you out.<eos> They signed over the deed to the place; they put it in the sister's name.<eos> You can't get in unless she invites you.<eos> Hmm, perhaps I'll lure him out another way.<eos> If killing his girlfriend didn't get him out of the house, I don't know what will.<eos> I do.
I did everything you asked.<eos> I joined your stupid cult,<eos> I left my friends in the dust because that's what you needed!<eos> Marcel...<eos> I fought for Hope!<eos> I kept Hayley breathing!<eos> I kept white oak from piercing your cold, black heart.<eos> I did everything!<eos> We know.<eos> No, you don't.

How about a magical miracle baby?<eos> You are going to wake them, aren't you?<eos> I've got a party to finish.<eos> Go to hell. Ah.<eos> Still smarting over the whole Cami thing?<eos> Well, if you wanted a happier tale, perhaps you should've inquired about my recent vacation to the Maldives.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Because I can.<eos> If you have some sick rivalry with Klaus, then you guys can compete to see who's most miserable, but you don't have to hurt Cami.<eos> Of course I do!
You wanted me to be the regent of the nine covens.<eos> You believed that I could lead our people.<eos> But how am I supposed to be a leader when you keep jerking me around like I'm a damn puppet or something?<eos> I need you to talk to me.<eos> They won't answer you.<eos> Van Nguyen.<eos> All grown up, I see.<eos> Not that it matters, man.<eos> This ain't got nothing to do with you.<eos> Actually, it does.
I don't know.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Captain Lee!<eos> Chief...<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it!<eos> You just need to tell us!<eos> Come on and tell us!<eos> I don't know! - Tell us!<eos> - I don't!
They have lesbians out hating men, but... a guy?<eos> You really believe people don't care when a male is violated?<eos> I put a mattress on my back and carry it around, you think they're gonna put me on TV?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> You want that kind of attention?<eos> I just want it to be over.<eos> I go on Instagram, I go on Vine, and somebody's got my picture, somebody's saying some stuff, and... My mom just keeps wanting me to talk about it.<eos> She's... she's doing interviews and crap.<eos> She's... She just wants to be there for you.<eos> Now she does.
Stop making excuses for him.<eos> He's been different ever since he started going there.<eos> Okay.<eos> "Okay," what?<eos> I am just tired of fighting with you.<eos> So, okay.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> All that bitch does is yell.<eos> Do not talk about Mom like that.<eos> She does.
I'm not sanctimonious.<eos> You're just a hypocritical prick then?<eos> You slept with him.<eos> And?<eos> "And?"<eos> I don't want to fight with you.<eos> It's just, uh...<eos> I just wish that it'd ended up better between you and me, you know?<eos> We would be scratching each other's eyes out by now. Haha!<eos> But I do, too.
We're a family operation.<eos> Come with me. Shall I bring the dress?<eos> Of course.<eos> This chapel is very pretty.<eos> I think she'll like it.<eos> Uh, who?<eos> My mother.<eos> Oh, well, she would have liked it.<eos> Norman, I don't believe we ever truly lose those we love.<eos> Neither do I.
We'll check out MacArthur Park Station.<eos> Good job.<eos> Look, I don't want to draw this out, so I'm just gonna say it.<eos> You invited me into your home, and you trusted me.<eos> I obviously violated that trust.<eos> You did.<eos> I'm sure I can contribute more if I was just put in a position to.<eos> Did you know the Mandels?<eos> No.<eos> Not many people in the LA art community did.
Alec, wait.<eos> If you hadn't gotten here in time, I...<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm glad you and Jace are okay now.<eos> I didn't do this for Jace.<eos> Then I'm glad you did it for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You have an interesting effect on people, Clary Fray.<eos> He helped save Luke's life.<eos> You all did.
I know Mom swore you to secrecy, but I've seen you stand up to her before.<eos> Why didn't you tell me about any of this?<eos> Because I was afraid you'd hate us.<eos> Not possible.<eos> Okay... the last few days, I have not had all of the information.<eos> And you still don't.<eos> But you need to know everything.<eos> It'll help you find the Mortal Cup. How?<eos> You're just gonna have to trust me.<eos> I do, more than anything.
Everybody has to leave!<eos> Daniella!<eos> Please!<eos> Get it off!<eos> Come on!<eos> Help me! Aah!<eos> We gotta split up.<eos> Not a good idea. I said split up.<eos> Not a good idea.<eos> Just do it!
Move it!<eos> Move! Move it!<eos> Yo, let's load the guns up, bro.<eos> Where the guns at?<eos> Oh, don't you have 'em?<eos> Man, do I look like I got 'em?<eos> No.<eos> Dude, I told you to get 'em from the truck.<eos> That ain't what you said.<eos> Man, yeah, I did, man.
Yo, let's load the guns up, bro.<eos> Where the guns at?<eos> Oh, don't you have 'em?<eos> Man, do I look like I got 'em?<eos> No.<eos> Dude, I told you to get 'em from the truck.<eos> That ain't what you said.<eos> Man, yeah, I did, man.<eos> You told me to help what's-his-face here!<eos> No, I didn't, man!
- Yeah.<eos> Well, I was on my way to the...<eos> Right.<eos> And all of a sudden...<eos> And...<eos> And then what?<eos> Marshmallows.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> Does anybody have a car?<eos> I do.
You talk about trading hands on a rooftop, Red.<eos> I'm talking about shit, okay?<eos> Shit that you ain't been in.<eos> - I know one thing.<eos> - What's that?<eos> War changes people.<eos> Sometimes they see things they can't unsee.<eos> Come home to find home's not there anymore.<eos> It changed.<eos> Or maybe they did.
Thank you, Gabby. Thank you so much.<eos> The second place, or silver category of Fluffy, from the World Mascot Association goes to... Heshe the Rabbi and Willy the Worm, Tussolon Tigers Canoe Team, Israel.<eos> Shalom.<eos> Congratulations, Heshe.<eos> And now we'll go on, to keep things moving, to the first place, or gold, category...<eos> No, I announce the gold category.<eos> -You gave out the bronze.<eos> -I gave out the bronze.<eos> You gave out the silver.<eos> Then I do the gold.
- Yeah.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I'm Alison. - Hmm.<eos> Suzanne.<eos> Uh... it's not Bring Your Stranger to Work Day.<eos> - Poussey got Oriental Trading over there.<eos> Yeah, I think Final Call here is a little different.<eos> Come on, man. Chill.<eos> Uh, Alison... do you have hair?<eos> I do.
Some fishermen found him unconscious on the beach.<eos> There's a legend in town...<eos> They say Shaka pushed him to the coast.<eos> That explains his connection with her.<eos> And what about you and Beto?<eos> Look, you hold the reins here, both of them, and you go one way or the other.<eos> That's very good.<eos> My son loved orcas too.<eos> He always asked me to take him to the attack channel.<eos> I never did...
Well, how much could we get for the back pasture?<eos> Yeah, we need to take the first offer that comes in.<eos> We gotta cut back.<eos> So, let's do about half grain and then do two thirds of a scoop of the electrolytes.<eos> And you can still do the same amount of oil...<eos> Hey, Lexi?<eos> If Red Bucket didn't exist, what would happen to the horses?<eos> Where would they go?<eos> Red Bucket does exist.<eos> Well, yeah, but what if it didn't?
That's what's up!<eos> Y'all better stay the hell away from us!<eos> Calm down, Jefferson.<eos> - Traitor!<eos> - Not possible.<eos> I was never on your side.<eos> I was on my side.<eos> - You'll never win!<eos> - Wake up, pal.<eos> We already did.
So this is the famous Fogwell's.<eos> Yeah, breathe it in fast.<eos> If we get arrested for breaking and entering, the fun kinda stops.<eos> Shows what you know.<eos> I haven't been here in a while.<eos> I bet nothing's moved.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - So tell me.<eos> - How does a blind man box? - Oh, uh...<eos> I don't...
I don't know if he pulled the trigger, but he gave the order.<eos> Did you ever try to find that piece of shit?<eos> Yeah, once.<eos> When I was a kid.<eos> Got nothing.<eos> Learned to live with it.<eos> He probably went underground.<eos> Well, six feet, I hope.<eos> You don't have to feel sorry for me.<eos> I don't.
Castle's awake.<eos> Soon, he'll plead guilty, then it's open and shut.<eos> Open and shut is good.<eos> New York will sleep better knowing Frank Castle's behind bars.<eos> I know I will.<eos> Sleep even better when he's dead.<eos> Uh, dead?<eos> Well, lethal injection, probably, although the electric chair is a possibility.<eos> New York doesn't have the death penalty.<eos> Yeah, but Delaware does.
- All the same.<eos> Representing Grotto might have complicated matters, but then again, all evidence of our work with him and our deal with you seems to have disappeared from public record.<eos> It's almost as if someone didn't want it known that you violated a witpro contract, jeopardized the safety of said witness, and then ordered a shoot-to-kill on Castle.<eos> But I guess Ms. Reyes could just confess to that when she files this conflict of interest complaint.<eos> We have our case files to back up our story.<eos> How's your side looking?<eos> The fact of the matter is, Ms. Reyes, the only person who shouldn't be here right now is you.<eos> Seeing as it's a breach of ethics for the prosecuting attorney to communicate with the defendant without his assigned legal counsel present.<eos> So, if you'll excuse us, we'd like to resume convincing Mr. Castle that, unlike his current legal counsel, we can actually help him.<eos> - You already did.
- Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> The fact that it fades...<eos> We took our blanket down to... our spot.<eos> She was by the carousel on the lawn...<eos> Then I heard her shout.<eos> Scream.<eos> It was a grown man.<eos> Who did you see?<eos> I didn't.
She was covering her tracks, but the trail just kept spreading wider.<eos> And when I caught wind of it, my hands were tied.<eos> It was... it was just too late.<eos> But I couldn't let myself go down with her.<eos> So you slipped Karen the X-ray.<eos> Reyes ordered the DNR on Castle?<eos> His family was gone.<eos> Castle was hanging by a thread.<eos> She just wanted the problem to go away.<eos> Well, it didn't.
No, I just...<eos> I just did what you taught me, Stick.<eos> Matty, I'm... proud of you.<eos> Come on, old man.<eos> Let's get you out of here.<eos> Hello, boys.<eos> Do you remember when we met... you told me you'd never abandon me?<eos> It's funny.<eos> For the life of me... I can't remember being so naive I'd believe you.<eos> But I did.
Unprecedented volumes of uncut narcotics into Manhattan.<eos> -How's he doing it?<eos> -Well, that'd be the mystery.<eos> Okay, look, there's, uh... an unfinished highway on Long Island that was illegally used as a landing strip in the '90s.<eos> I mean, it would require payoffs, bribes--<eos> This guy's a ghost.<eos> He works alone or close to it.<eos> I just--<eos> -How do you know?<eos> -I just do.
What if... from now on, if... if we make it... wherever you run, I... I run with you?<eos> You're not serious.<eos> I've never been more serious.<eos> This... Elektra, this is a part of me that I need.<eos> And you're the only one who gets it.<eos> Without this, I'm not alive. I'm not.<eos> Not really.<eos> And I know that now, thanks to you.<eos> I don't know what we are together, and if we have any chance in the future...<eos> I don't...
The enemy had set up an ambush at the only LZ that would accommodate one of our birds.<eos> Sorry, Colonel?<eos> LZ is a landing zone that can accommodate a helicopter.<eos> So the enemy, they block this landing zone, knowing it was the only shot the team had to get out alive.<eos> All they had to do was wait.<eos> They knew that Frank's team had to come to them.<eos> Fish in a barrel.<eos> So to speak.<eos> Only fish don't know they're gonna die.<eos> These men did.
Kid... pulls the knife from the breast of his dead mother and goes to work.<eos> He cuts down some of the Hand's finest warriors.<eos> They're lying dead... kid's standing.<eos> They give him a name.<eos> The Chaste.<eos> And he's just one kid?<eos> Alone?<eos> Kid grows up, rounds up every warrior he can.<eos> Men, women, young, old, doesn't matter as long as they kick ass.<eos> And they do.
But we found his parents.<eos> They're dead.<eos> Then where the hell is he?<eos> Come with me if you want to live.<eos> I always wanted to say that.<eos> - That's younger you?<eos> - What'd you tell him?<eos> That we work for a secret agency called A.R.G.U.S.<eos> - I think he bought it.<eos> - Course he did.
We can blast our way out.<eos> This isn't "Bonnie and Clyde."<eos> And I'm not going anywhere without the rest of the team.<eos> Maybe I didn't make myself clear.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Don't act like you're that same cold-hearted bastard that I first met.<eos> I remember Russia.<eos> And you were the one who told me not to kill Stein.<eos> Yeah, because you seem to have a problem with being a killer.<eos> I, however, don't.
Even with only a partial induction, you were the greatest of our hunters, Chronos.<eos> After we're finished, temporal criminals and time pirates alike will quake at the sound of your bootsteps.<eos> Mm, well, for your sake, you better hope that plan works.<eos> 'Cause if it doesn't, that boot's gonna crush your skull.<eos> - What is this place?<eos> - Our Holy of Holies.<eos> The Oculus viewing chamber, our most powerful window into past, present, and future.<eos> The source of all our information on the timeline.<eos> Why did I now know about this?<eos> No captain does.
Don't make it painful.<eos> You forget.<eos> I love pain.<eos> I'm an angel.<eos> You can't beat me, little demon.<eos> Stop and hear me out.<eos> Men they always want to talk.<eos> Enough!<eos> We want the same thing!<eos> Oh, do we?
Godfather with a twist?<eos> But surely you've heard the expression...<eos> "Deal with the Devil"?<eos> - Mm! - Come on, give me a break.<eos> No, people come to me to ask for favors, and more often than not, I'm happy to oblige.<eos> What do you get?<eos> Well, sometimes, I have something in mind, but, usually, like with Benny, it's simply to be repaid at a later date.<eos> A devilish IOU, if you will.<eos> Who would take a deal like that?<eos> They all do.
I was, yes, but I have good news for you on that front.<eos> I'm healed.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Yes. Yes, back to my normal, devilish self.<eos> No pesky empathy to be found.<eos> I'd kick a puppy if one waltzed by.<eos> I'm joking. Puppies don't waltz.<eos> You like to hide insecurity in humor, don't you?<eos> (laughs): I don't have insecurities.<eos> Mm. Everyone does.
Well, there was a... a roach from another joint, freshly smoked.<eos> Nick's pupils weren't dilated.<eos> He didn't seem high.<eos> Maybe he wasn't alone.<eos> Where's the roach?<eos> Well, I added it to my joint. (sighs) Well, it's the best part.<eos> So our only evidence is currently in your lungs?<eos> Uh, you really wanted to say "up in smoke" then, didn't you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I most definitely did not.
So how do you afford this place?<eos> I don't; it's my mother's.<eos> I moved in after Dan and I separated, okay?<eos> LUCIFER: Penelope Decker?<eos> Hold on a minute.<eos> Your mother's Penelope Decker?<eos> - Queen of '80s cheeseball sci-fi?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> (gasps) You have to introduce me.<eos> Mm, I don't.
I'm just realizing the gravity of what you're saying.<eos> That I'm allergic to lead projectiles?<eos> All I have to do is wait for some pitiful thug to end you.<eos> And right back to Hell you go.<eos> People come to me to ask for favors, and more often than not,<eos> - I'm happy to oblige.<eos> - What do you get?<eos> A devilish I.O.U., if you will.<eos> Who would take a deal like that?<eos> They all do.
He shot up your church, he's most likely running a drug ring behind your back, and, oh, yes, killed a man.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> Look, what if it's true?<eos> Then he needs me even more.<eos> How can you still have faith in this boy?<eos> God has faith in him.<eos> In all of us.<eos> Even in our darkest moments.<eos> Oh, you really believe that.<eos> I do.
Please tell me, we didn't...<eos> Did we ever.<eos> And I'm pretty sure we made Rosemary's baby.<eos> Oh, Detective, it was extraordinary.<eos> The heat, the gymnastics.<eos> I mean, you had moves that made even the Devil blush.<eos> Oh, no, this is bad.<eos> Whatever happened last night, don't tell me, I'd rather not know.<eos> What, that we didn't do the nasty?<eos> We didn't?
The least I could do is ruin your night.<eos> Enjoy your evening.<eos> How'd you even find me, Maze?<eos> Followed the sweet stench of failure.<eos> Look, don't blame me for your problems, all right?<eos> It's not my fault that you betrayed your boss.<eos> My problems are your problems.<eos> Which would be the only thing that you and I have in common.<eos> And so you came here because... because you have nowhere else to go?<eos> Yes, I do.
What is it you think I desire,<eos> Detective?<eos> To do good.<eos> To help people.<eos> I did some research into you, Will, and apparently, you don't charge for your services here at the foundation.<eos> I make a nice living, thanks to my corporate work.<eos> Yeah, you protect your clients like a bulldog, but underneath it all, you're a big softie, aren't you?<eos> I don't need to take money away from those kids.<eos> No.<eos> But Vanessa does.
I knew some folks who moved to Buenos Aires back in the day.<eos> Oh. Good people?<eos> Nazis.<eos> No extradition treaty in Argentina.<eos> Just a nasty bunch of miscreants hiding in plain sight.<eos> Gosh, they got away with murder.<eos> You did kill your husband, didn't you?<eos> No, that's absurd.<eos> I have to admit, I'm not entirely sure why, but Detective Decker will figure it out.<eos> She always does.
Tucking marvelous.<eos> Right, we're all here to honor Tim Dunlear's legacy, and what better way to do that than to reveal his killer?<eos> Wouldn't you agree, Mrs. Dunlear?<eos> Time to show your friends your true colors.<eos> Tell them all your nasty desires.<eos> No need.<eos> We already have everything, how she embezzled money from the foundation, and when Tim found out about it, you killed him.<eos> Ah, see? Told you she'd figure it out.<eos> You have no proof.<eos> Actually, we do.
I kept it a secret.<eos> I thought I could use it to get us back home.<eos> And you'd give that to me?<eos> Believe me,<eos> I don't understand this either.<eos> Why do I feel like I'm walking death row?<eos> Should I order my final meal now to save time?<eos> Dan says he has it handled.<eos> You do, right?<eos> I do.
Trixie!<eos> Come out, honey!<eos> Mommy, is it over?<eos> Yeah, baby, it's over.<eos> Come here.<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh, I'm so happy you're okay.<eos> Excuse me if I don't join the group hug.<eos> I thought he killed you.<eos> Oh, he did.
Move it up.<eos> OK.<eos> Take the brace.<eos> A student for the strut, a cushion for the head.<eos> Vets, they march ahead<eos> Their dicks up proud in the air<eos> Cuz a vet will fuck you anywhere<eos> They are men - yes sir! With giant balls, for her<eos> They like a laugh, they like a drink They like to screw and we do too!<eos> Oh yes, they do, and we do too
Where you kids off to?<eos> Just having some shawarma.<eos> Then back to campus.<eos> You're at the vet school?<eos> I came down there once with my pig, he had the flu.<eos> Flu's bad for pigs.<eos> But he's better now.<eos> You have a pig in your truck?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We all do.
In private.<eos> Off the record.<eos> Lay everything on the table.<eos> Sounds remarkably like a date.<eos> But what does your boss think?<eos> My boss isn't always willing to take the necessary steps to get things done.<eos> You're going rogue?<eos> How fun.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?<eos> You don't.
Afraid.<eos> I know.<eos> I once went to sleep for a long time, too.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> But when I woke up, I wasn't alone.<eos> You're not gonna be alone either.<eos> Thank you,<eos> Kara.<eos> She didn't deserve what happened to her.<eos> No, she did not.
Again. I'll work on a plan with Hank.<eos> Keep your eyes open.<eos> Ms. Grant, everything okay?<eos> No, I need you in the office...<eos> Now.<eos> Hank.<eos> J'onn.<eos> I should have known... this isn't your fault.<eos> If I hadn't pushed you to use your powers, none of this would have happened.<eos> But it did.
My wife and daughters... burned.<eos> I escaped.<eos> I survived.<eos> To my great shame.<eos> I will hear my family's screams until the day I die.<eos> Look at me.<eos> J'onn, look at me.<eos> There's no shame in surviving.<eos> If your family would have lived, you wouldn't want them to be ashamed.<eos> But they didn't.
Look, I-I know she's a little unusual... but we've both been put through the same wringer.<eos> That's what I told Bob.<eos> "They're living together because who else could understand that situation?"<eos> But you're past all that now.<eos> Honey, she's holding you back.<eos> -Nobody wants to be around her.<eos> -No.<eos> Just a second--<eos> Oh, come on, you've been saying she drives you crazy for years.<eos> Well, she did.
That's what I told Bob.<eos> "They're living together because who else could understand that situation?"<eos> But you're past all that now.<eos> Honey, she's holding you back.<eos> -Nobody wants to be around her.<eos> -No.<eos> Just a second--<eos> Oh, come on, you've been saying she drives you crazy for years.<eos> Well, she did.<eos> And she does.
The FCC will pull their license.<eos> It ain't about airplay.<eos> We get the DJs talking, the kids will find the record.<eos> Yeah, but they have to hear it first, don't they?<eos> They'll hear about it from the DJs who'll tell them about it after they hear it at the Dolls concert.<eos> With those fucking lyrics?<eos> They'll be arrested.<eos> No, they're cool over there.<eos> Nobody will call the cops.<eos> Great if they do.
Like you give a shit.<eos> "Community Carers"?<eos> That sounds kind of gay.<eos> Gay for safety, maybe.<eos> Gay for justice.<eos> -Huh? -It is not gay.<eos> At least in the pejorative sense.<eos> We are a group of like-minded individuals that does not want to see this prison overrun by gangs and gang violence.<eos> Don't you want that?<eos> I do. Ow.
It doesn't bother me.<eos> Well, JT and I ought to have your new office up and running today, so you can work in some nice peace and quiet.<eos> I'm so excited to show you.<eos> I'm excited to see it.<eos> Thank you again for taking the lead on finding that place for me. I have just...<eos> I have been crazed.<eos> Yeah, no, don't mention it.<eos> I've been having so much fun.<eos> You'll love it.<eos> Kyle did.
I still don't understand... why are we here?<eos> Why can't I go home?<eos> What if Albert calls?<eos> Because until we find out exactly why your husband was taken, Mrs. Toland, DHS needs to keep you safe.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Um, are you sure that you don't know anyone by the name of Dmitri Voynov?<eos> Boys, no jumping on the furniture, remember?<eos> Do you have any guns in the house?<eos> Yes, we do.
He hasn't even paid taxes in four years.<eos> Which is around the same time he stopped making money as an accountant.<eos> Who is this guy?<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Wait, what happened?<eos> - Don't ask.<eos> He doesn't want to talk about it.<eos> You sure Secretary Hill said that Albert worked for Voynov? - Yeah.<eos> Doesn't he?
There's been a lot of change.<eos> But... this can still be a good thing for us.<eos> We have to move on.<eos> I can't.<eos> Sorry, Mum, but we were part of something.<eos> We... saved them. I can't move on, and why would I want to?<eos> Mia will come back.<eos> She's got a point, Mum.<eos> It's pretty hard trying to be normal when we know what we know.<eos> Stuff no-one else in the world does.
And someone's like, "Are you out of your fucking mind?<eos> Your spine'll snap.<eos> Sit down!"<eos> "Okay."<eos> "I tried. I'm sorry."<eos> That looks amazing.<eos> I really want that old guy confidence that I see... in the locker room. Yeah. That's another thing.<eos> Another thing I've noticed since joining the gym, there's two types of guys:<eos> Guys that are 65 and older, and then guys that cover their dicks.<eos> Because old guys... do not.
I... I need to de-poof.<eos> Oh, this poor kid.<eos> She's not gonna know what hit her.<eos> You Grace?<eos> It took me frickin' forever to find this place.<eos> There's like no street parking and your neighbor's dog is a dick.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> All right, let's start with the basics.<eos> -Do you have a résumé?<eos> -I do.
Rafael, I know exactly what it feels like to be angry with God.<eos> My husband, Brad, he was... he was the love of my life, and God ripped him away from me.<eos> Afterwards, I was just consumed with rage.<eos> I was his most faithful servant.<eos> Why take my Matthew?<eos> I asked myself the exact same question when I lost Brad.<eos> All of that pain, it is... it is overwhelming, isn't it?<eos> It burns.<eos> And that's why you felt the need to take the lives of those boys because each time you took one from this world, you thought that it would stop that pain.<eos> But it didn't, did it?
Turns out the Feds suck.<eos> I just hope I can find Vincent before it's too late.<eos> I tracked Vincent's earpiece to 62nd Street near the airport.<eos> You want Tess to send backup?<eos> I think I'm bringing my own.<eos> You really don't want to do this, you know.<eos> I know.<eos> But I don't have a choice.<eos> No, no, no, we all have a choice.<eos> You didn't.
Well, then why are you acting like you do?<eos> Because he knew I could forgive almost anything but this, with her.<eos> Oh, get over yourself.<eos> Sol did a stupid emotional Sol thing.<eos> And married me 24 hours after he did the stupid thing he did!<eos> He wanted to tell you, but I wouldn't let him.<eos> Not before you went into surgery.<eos> -So you knew?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Everyone did.
Sol did a stupid emotional Sol thing.<eos> And married me 24 hours after he did the stupid thing he did!<eos> He wanted to tell you, but I wouldn't let him.<eos> Not before you went into surgery.<eos> -So you knew?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Everyone did.<eos> Why-<eos> - What does it matter now?<eos> It doesn't anymore.
Oh, of course.<eos> You won the argument.<eos> You always do.<eos> You're a great lawyer.<eos> But every time you won with me, you just proved you cared more about the argument than you did about me.<eos> And I hated you for it.<eos> Robert, this is the great love of your life.<eos> And you're just gonna throw it away?<eos> I didn't throw it away.<eos> He did.
I mean, animals are getting smarter every day.<eos> Instead of hunting, wouldn't you like to go to a high school talent show?<eos> -I need a happy distraction.<eos> -From what?<eos> Frankie, why did you really come out here today?<eos> I dig you.<eos> I mean, that's before I found out you were Ted Nugent.<eos> So what is it?<eos> You don't want to hear about the Chilean soap opera that's become my life.<eos> Actually, I do.
- He married Miss Utah, and then I went on to medical school.<eos> Brains and beauty.<eos> I'll be damned.<eos> When I get off here tonight, drinks for the good doctor are on me.<eos> All right.<eos> There you go, guys.<eos> But-- But why not stay a pilot?<eos> Because I almost died.<eos> I was-- I was flying over Lake Placid one day, and my co-pilot dared me to walk out on the wing and jump.<eos> So I did.
Of course, Daddy.<eos> Very happy.<eos> So kiss the girls for me.<eos> Tell them I'll see them very soon.<eos> Yes, I would like to put a call through to Chicago.<eos> A Mr. Hugh Hefner.<eos> If you'll remember, it was me who lobbied for you when we first met.<eos> I was the one that wanted you as a major investor.<eos> I do remember, and then you threw in with some perfume magnate instead.<eos> No, I didn't do that.
I'll show you slides of, well, many things.<eos> What kinds of things?<eos> Women of all shapes and sizes of various hair colors, clothes, naked women, their genitalia, then we'll move on to couples having sex, men.<eos> Men?<eos> I'm not attracted to men.<eos> So then you won't get an erection.<eos> It's the point of the wires.<eos> The body doesn't lie.<eos> Look, Dr. Masters, I want to get better.<eos> I really do.
Because... for 12 years, I've tried every way-- every wrong and misguided way to win your heart only to realize, in these last very dark weeks, you wanted something else.<eos> So you picked someone else.<eos> Which means that part of us together is over... for good.<eos> I'm glad that that is clear between us.<eos> Well, there's not a lot we know about St. Joseph.<eos> He was Jesus' earthly father.<eos> He, uh, dreamed a lot, and, well, in those dreams, he was visited by angels.<eos> And, uh, one day, an angel appeared to him and told him that he must take the Virgin Mary as his wife.<eos> Does everyone understand what--<eos> They do not.
We need to get fire trucks here immediately.<eos> There's a unit in Dharavi.<eos> This whole block will go up.<eos> I just wanted to give him better life.<eos> He has suffered enough.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> This doesn't have to be the end.<eos> I could not let him go without good heart.<eos> - He deserves that.<eos> - He does.
What became of the Ancients from the Old World?<eos> - The rest of the seven?<eos> - We have not had<eos> - any contact with them.<eos> - My guess is that He destroyed them before coming to the New World.<eos> And now he's come here to finish the job.<eos> Setrakian may be a thief, but he's a fighter.<eos> Which is more than can be said for the lot of you.<eos> We want to know what you've learned from the Lumen.<eos> Of course you do.
- rudderless.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You realize the Master saw all this through the eyes of those munchers, right?<eos> He's probably already got a workaround, you know?<eos> No, no, no, he didn't see shit.<eos> The signal paralyzed their communication systems when it paralyzed them.<eos> They just went off his grid.<eos> You want to seal him in this, the device can help you do that.<eos> It worked on strigoi, but do you think it could also incapacitate the Master?<eos> I do.
- It's just smooth as silk. - No 'hood shit.<eos> Yo, nothin' pops off in this club, y'all hear me? - Got it.<eos> - Got a lot of rich white people here that ain't afraid to call 911.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - So don't get jumpy.<eos> I heard you, motherfucker, we good.<eos> - Let's get money.<eos> - Let's get it.<eos> Man of the hour, Mr. Rashad Jennings.<eos> James, how you doing?
We'll get right to work.<eos> I can't wait.<eos> - To us.<eos> Oh, Tasha.<eos> Good to see you again.<eos> What the fuck are you doing here?<eos> Oh, you know, now it's our club too.<eos> Now that the paperwork is signed, we have to talk.<eos> I don't have a damn thing to say to you.<eos> Oh, but we do.
Very well.<eos> Let me talk to his mistress.<eos> For God's sake!<eos> How should I trust the evidence of this woman?<eos> Because this woman is my sister.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Yes, Your Highness.<eos> And?<eos> Does Count Odo talk freely of his ambitions?<eos> Yes, he does.
But I know the boy is safe.<eos> Athelstan walks beside him, every step, every mile.<eos> Of that, I am most certain.<eos> And now, forgive me.<eos> I am weary and must rest.<eos> Bjorn!<eos> What?<eos> Tell everyone. We're going to make camp here.<eos> Why would we camp here?<eos> - Just do it.
- He thought so, too.<eos> So he said, "Sabine, fear makes you strong if you face it."<eos> Oh. That's good advice.<eos> I'm sorry. Such a chatterbox today.<eos> It's just... it's been so long since I had someone to talk to.<eos> Don't you dare be sorry, Sabine.<eos> I feel the same way.<eos> You know, the truth is, I work with men all day and right now, I cannot believe how nice it is to be talking to a woman.<eos> - I thought I told you to go away.<eos> - You did.
Look, since Ghost closed down the Laundromats, we're gonna need to figure out another way to handle the money.<eos> Baby, I'm gonna fuck this up if I do it on my own.<eos> We use Tasha till I learn the ropes, and then we get rid of her.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> But we'll figure this out together, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> But together.<eos> I was thinking about something.<eos> If I had found the location on Lobos, you had a plan in place?<eos> I did.
He's hurting.<eos> My little boy is hurting.<eos> I would do anything for you.<eos> I would die for you.<eos> I would give my life.<eos> Did you murder Janine Laurent in the early hours of this morning?<eos> This is my child.<eos> It doesn't matter to me what he's done or what becomes of those... ..little tarts who walk the streets of Montmartre at night.<eos> Did you kill Janine Laurent in the early hours of this morning?<eos> Yes, I did.

- You're not old.<eos> Well, I'm old enough to have had more than one man.<eos> How many?<eos> His name is Nicu.<eos> He is five.<eos> - And where is he?<eos> - With my parents in Bucharest.<eos> But how can you stand it?<eos> Don't you miss him?<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> Yesterday, you said that you were gonna draw boundaries<eos> - and spend more time with me.<eos> - I-I know.<eos> But instead, you blew me off and... and spent the night at work, curled up with your ex?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, but I-I am so sorry, you know?<eos> And... and all I can think of to say is...<eos> You sure look pretty after a 5k run.<eos> Do you know how long a 'k' is?<eos> Because I did not.
You know, don't be afraid to use my power.<eos> Ms. Burke.<eos> Looks like it's just us now.<eos> I don't even know how to say this.<eos> My husband Randall... he's not my husband anymore.<eos> He's not?<eos> His manners, his speech, his drinking...<eos> - He needs a drug and alcohol program?<eos> - No. He used to drink a lot.<eos> And now he doesn't.
It is not about Hillary Clinton.<eos> It is not about anybody else.<eos> It is about you.<eos> With tensions high and PACs dredging up scandals from the 1990's and earlier, it's no wonder everyone seems to have politics on the brain.<eos> I would hope to be able to enlist Bernie, uh, in helping me reach out to his supporters.<eos> Adding to the tension is the defiant Bernie Sanders.<eos> Don't let people tell you that you can't think big!<eos> The Democrats are still struggling to fight the unconventional campaign of that most most unconventional Republican candidate, Donald Trump.<eos> Eight years ago, many Hillary supporters swore they would never vote for Barack Obama.<eos> But then many did.
Yeah, I'm sorry, dude, but if she's the perfect reflection of you, doesn't that make her fifteen years too old for you?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> They're very friendly.<eos> Yeah, I think he... picked up on that.<eos> Isn't he supposed to have a muzzle?<eos> Yeah, he is, but he didn't like it.<eos> Oh, he didn't?
- Use that.<eos> - We've never met before.<eos> Remind her who the First Lady is.<eos> Good morning, Julia.<eos> Good morning, Mrs. Underwood.<eos> Please, have a seat.<eos> We want to be inclusive.<eos> We'd like the NRA to work with us on getting this bill passed.<eos> We have major support on both sides of the aisle.<eos> Well, you do for now, but not for long.
I can make you a deal.<eos> I can...<eos> I can make you an offer.<eos> See, Hassan, this type of behavior... this suggests to us something we call<eos> "avoidance and transference".<eos> It's what makes me think you're lying.<eos> Of course he's lying.<eos> Look at him.<eos> If you hadn't seen the Carsons, why didn't you just tell us?<eos> I did!

I missed you.<eos> I missed you, too.<eos> How was your trip?<eos> Everything worked out.<eos> How are the boys?<eos> They still fighting?<eos> Um, they've been inseparable since you left.<eos> You know they take care of each other when you're gone, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course they do.
Sheriff, they want a picture with you.<eos> Oh, okay. All right.<eos> - I'll be right back.<eos> - Okay, big shot.<eos> Norma Bates?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Rebecca Hamilton.<eos> I work for the bank.<eos> Oh, how do you know me?<eos> I don't.
He did.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mighty fine food here.<eos> What happened to my husband?<eos> Old George, he carried me to the hospital.<eos> That was long after he cut off my arm here.<eos> - Grandpa cut off his arm?<eos> - Son.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he did.
- Jana!<eos> Clear!<eos> How much longer are they gonna extend the quarantine?<eos> There's some things about the cordon I'm not gonna be able to tell you.<eos> And you say exactly what they want you to say.<eos> Last night I'm a hero, but today I'm the enemy.<eos> Where there's a mouthpiece, there's a secret.<eos> Until the virus dies out, we can't break the cordon.<eos> Then how do we get the healthy people out?<eos> We don't.
I'm just trying to help.<eos> Okay, Liz, you want to help?<eos> Then you find out who killed my client in jail and get your damn car out of my driveway, please.<eos> So, how you holding up?<eos> Must have been pretty tough yesterday.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> This Jackson guy.<eos> He wasn't at our wedding, never even heard his name before last week, and then, all of a sudden, he's Boots' lawyer?<eos> How do you guys all know him so well?<eos> We don't really.
Look, if it brings Barry back to this Earth, I'm doing it.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> The more we talk about it, the less sure I'll be, so let's just do it.<eos> Okay. There's an override switch on every stabilizer ring.<eos> - I'll create the vortex.<eos> - Yeah. And you flip all of them.<eos> They should all reboot.<eos> Got it.<eos> Once that's done, you power up the cannon. - The breach should stabilize.<eos> - And what if it doesn't?
It's February 3rd, 3:00 in the afternoon.<eos> I'm Paul Wincott, Deputy District Attorney for Alameda County, California.<eos> This hearing will be visually recorded as well as transcribed by a duly appointed stenographer for the Supreme Court of the State of California under the jurisdiction of the honorable Judge Thomas Vancleeve.<eos> Doctor, now it's my understanding that you'd like to make an opening statement before we proceed with a series of questions pertaining to your case.<eos> This is a confession.<eos> It has very little to do with the dead bodies you found at my clinic.<eos> They were simply collateral damage.<eos> My confession deals with the professional killer Frank Kitchen or whatever his real name is.<eos> Contrary to my oath as a physician and all civilized medical standards I performed unwanted and unnecessary radical surgery on Mr. Kitchen whom I admit was a completely unknowing and unwilling patient.<eos> I did it partially for deeply personal reasons.
Mrs. Said, I can reach you wherever it is you're staying and give you updates as I receive them.<eos> I cannot go until my son's body returns home.<eos> Then I will take him and have him buried next to his father.<eos> Now, Mrs. Willis, if you'll come with me, I'll be able to fill you in on the details of your son's disappearance.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Mrs. Willis, what aren't you telling me?<eos> I was just trying to protect her.<eos> Malik's mother doesn't know who her son really was.<eos> But you do?
Mitchell, you can't talk and feel the burn at the same time.<eos> Donkey-kick like you mean it, Jennifer.<eos> I'm just curious, because this tape was on its way to goodwill, and all of a sudden, you pulled it out of your back pocket.<eos> I put on a couple of extra pounds, and Jane got me out of a similar situation in the '80s.<eos> Please tell me you were wearing leg warmers.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Oh. We got this, girls.<eos> March it out.<eos> Well, for whatever it's worth, dad, I didn't notice.<eos> Gloria did.
of coconut oil.<eos> Uh, we looked into coconut oil.<eos> At length.<eos> But palm oil has it beat.<eos> Mm-hmm. It doesn't require hydrogenation.<eos> -It comes with its own antioxidants.<eos> -It inhibits cancer growth.<eos> It has amazing mouthfeel.<eos> And it doesn't affect taste or smell.<eos> Coconut oil does.
-Oh, how are you, sweetie?<eos> Rock bottom.<eos> My life is in the crapper of the crapper and Frankie's not talking to me.<eos> Mmm, sounds like you might have something to do with that?<eos> I don't know why she has to blow everything out of proportion.<eos> You know, I might have said some terrible things to her, but I was drunk.<eos> -I didn't mean it.<eos> -Oh, really?<eos> Did you know in North Korea they use vodka as truth serum?<eos> No, they don't.
Why would you do this?<eos> So I was prepared for any occasion.<eos> So, for example, I'd had a bad day, you'd come to the box and give me a gift. -That you bought years earlier.<eos> -Yes.<eos> Except they were in a drawer then.<eos> -Big picture, Robert.<eos> -Ooh, pretty.<eos> I don't understand the problem.<eos> The problem is you don't understand the problem.<eos> - I don't.
- Yeah, so, what'd you do?<eos> - Told him to leave.<eos> So, he went ballistic, my manager got involved and then things got physical.<eos> You okay?<eos> I can take care of myself.<eos> I don't need no police.<eos> - So why'd you call us?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> You didn't call us?<eos> Who did?
Did he ever tell you about my brother John Rayburn?<eos> - The cop?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Carlos isn't in trouble.<eos> He just needs to talk to my brother.<eos> About what?<eos> You know, my family's helped Carlos a lot, and now we need him to help us, so if you could just tell him to contact my brother.<eos> I don't even know if I'll hear from him again.<eos> - But if you do?
Not happy to see me? - I told you<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know, I know, I know, I know, you're sorry.<eos> So you feel better now you cleared your conscience? What do you want?<eos> What do you want from me? !<eos> I want the truth, Bobby!<eos> All of it!<eos> I told you everything on the tape yesterday.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, you didn't.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
You think you can fix it?<eos> Yeah, it's actually quite common, ma'am.<eos> All you got to do is shut the main valve off.<eos> Uh, right.<eos> And that would be where?<eos> Usually they're along the retaining wall of the property.<eos> Sure.<eos> Hmm. No valve out here.<eos> You all have a basement?<eos> We do.
We'll release her to his custody at the end of the isolation period.<eos> It won't be long now for the rest.<eos> Ma'am, this way.<eos> I'm sorry, Aimee.<eos> It's for your own safety, ma'am.<eos> We can't trace all these people.<eos> Until the virus dies out, we can't break the cordon. Yeah.<eos> OK, fine.<eos> But how do we get the healthy people out?<eos> We don't.
I think the guy we saw was the female doctor's boyfriend, which means either he got her sick or she infected him.<eos> Either way, this ledger should prove that Sayid came in after Dr. Sanders was already sick, but the pages are missing.<eos> Someone tore them out.<eos> Katie, I just incinerated a little girl's body and collected the ashes of a fellow cop.<eos> OK?<eos> Can we save the detective act for the morning?<eos> Please?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you have a bad day?<eos> In an endless stream of them, yeah, I did.
I got someone in there, too.<eos> - When this is all over...<eos> - It's been two days.<eos> What?<eos> She hasn't been out in two days.<eos> Well, with this heat, could you blame her?<eos> Just because you haven't seen her, that doesn't mean...<eos> You know exactly what that means.<eos> I know you're probably gonna tell me that me being up here, being able to look in, has absolutely no effect on whether she's still alive.<eos> No. It doesn't.
I was wrong.<eos> Let us out!<eos> Stay back.<eos> Stay back!<eos> Thomas is a carrier.<eos> You'll be quarantined here for 48 hours.<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> - Don't test these guys.<eos> - I didn't even touch him.<eos> But I did.
I was wrong.<eos> Thomas is an asymptomatic carrier.<eos> If Thomas leaves the Cordon, the virus leaves with him! THOMAS:<eos> Miss Katie!<eos> You need to take him back!<eos> They're letting people out!<eos> You'll be quarantined here for 48 hours.<eos> - Get out of my way. - (guns cock)<eos> I didn't even touch him. LEX:<eos> I did.
Lex Carnahan, I never expected to see you under investigation.<eos> And yet you called me in.<eos> I don't remember getting your name.<eos> Blake.<eos> And, Lex, I'd like to look at this as a conversation between coworkers.<eos> We want the truth to emerge, and I would imagine you want that, too.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> And your cronies watching from that camera in the ceiling, they want the same thing, too?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, they do.
He also said that this technology was actually three meteors.<eos> Captain, I have surveillance footage which might be relevant.<eos> Thank you, Gideon.<eos> I've seen that rock before.<eos> Savage had one of those in 1958.<eos> He took our blood.<eos> He said he would use it in a ritual to erase time, take the blood back to 1700 B.C.<eos> - What are you doing? - Come on, man.<eos> We got to try it again.<eos> That thing that we did in World War II.
- Can't be.<eos> - Can.<eos> Thanks to time travel, and it's because of time travel that I know you're here.<eos> You're out here tonight, because you have felt an immanent presence of... something.<eos> - A... a meteorite?<eos> - And I'm going to give you a use for it which will give us the power to rewrite destiny itself.<eos> Change the course of the entire world.<eos> So if Savage plans on blowing up the world three times,<eos> - how do we stop him?<eos> - We don't.
We're gonna figure out a way to fix this mistake.<eos> This wasn't a mistake.<eos> You're sitting there acting like you don't know who this was.<eos> It was Darryl.<eos> I saw him in the street, and I recognized him, and I just...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just snapped.<eos> And I'm not sorry about it, either.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, he had it coming.<eos> They all do.
Detective Winters.<eos> Liz, this is Jackson.<eos> You said you wanted to talk.<eos> I'm ready to listen.<eos> You want to tell me what's going on?<eos> Boots is lying in a hospital bed.<eos> Gil told me you're his lawyer and that he got arrested for attempted murder.<eos> - Why did you lie to me?<eos> - I didn't lie.<eos> Yes, you did!
We'd be fish in a barrel. It's out of the question.<eos> You need to call your people off. We're better off with the tunnel.<eos> Your tunnel will take months to finish.<eos> You could be relocated before it's ready. But if it works, we can get everybody out.<eos> Two hundred of you, running around the forest?<eos> No papers, no clothes, no place to hide? You'll be hunted like dogs.<eos> Yeah, it's risky.<eos> But the truth is, we don't know how long we have left.<eos> Eric didn't know.<eos> None of us do.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> So, assuming we can get him face to face, why doesn't he just arrest us?<eos> Because if we don't come back, our cell releases incriminating photos of Sabine, and she'll be shot for treason.<eos> - What photos?<eos> - I told him we had photos<eos> - of her fraternizing with me.<eos> - But we don't.
because you'd finally be on the same side.<eos> - Please, talk to me.<eos> - I had to.<eos> I had to... execute 68 innocent men.<eos> As a display of reprisals for the murder of Generalfeldmarschall Brandt.<eos> You "had to"?<eos> I, I had to.<eos> I believed I had to.<eos> Like you believed you had to sacrifice your boy to the power you're serving now.<eos> What if you didn't?
He said he was scared.<eos> Let's just bury our dead.<eos> You must think I'm a monster.<eos> You're not a monster.<eos> Doing that to our own son...<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> I shouldn't have told you.<eos> No, no. Sabine,<eos> I know what it feels like.<eos> I do.
Oberfuhrer Franz Faber had a son.<eos> I saw a picture in his safe, same time as I saw the file on Camp X.<eos> His son was... different.<eos> - What does that have to do with Aurora?<eos> - She and Sabine were in church.<eos> Sharing secrets.<eos> She told Sabine that she killed René.<eos> Wait, René died in Ste.<eos> Lynette.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Of course they will!<eos> They will cheer me when I enter the city.<eos> I will be protector of the king.<eos> And then in a year or two, the little swine can have a fatal riding accident or die of typhus.<eos> But my army will hold the city until you, Gaston, give me back my title and full independence for Lorraine.<eos> I will no longer be France's vassal.<eos> In a few years' time, he'll be ordering his Council to double the price of wheat and throwing anyone who protests in jail.<eos> Do you have a problem with this?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Stop!<eos> What's the meaning of this?<eos> We have orders to stay these executions and take charge of the prisoners.<eos> Take charge and let them live?<eos> They want to release the murderous Spanish scum.<eos> What are you doing, Marcheaux?<eos> Let's see who the orders are from?<eos> No royal assent?<eos> Minister Treville needs no royal assent.<eos> Yes, he does.
Well, we know where he is now.<eos> Although, we've all fallen for that trap before.<eos> This time we've got the advantage.<eos> This note's addressed to three of us.<eos> Grimaud thinks D'Artagnan's dead.<eos> The midwife betrayed you.<eos> What made you so cruel?<eos> Why would you bring a child into this world?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> Oh, you don't, do you?
Mister.<eos> Mister Spence.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Didn't you call me that when we were first dating?<eos> Nope.<eos> I've never called you that.<eos> Really?<eos> I think I'd remember calling you a stupid nickname.<eos> Thought maybe that interview triggered something.<eos> Oh, well, it didn't.
You just have to prove that Spence had an alibi.<eos> Good. Yes.<eos> I'm just so worried.<eos> Honey, is any part of you worried that Spence might have done this?<eos> Of course not!<eos> You all knew him.<eos> You worked for him.<eos> And when he got drunk, he was a totally different person.<eos> One time, I thought he was gonna kill me.<eos> But he didn't.
I'm very flattered, but let's just forget this ever happened, okay?<eos> No one needs to ever know.<eos> You here to drink or dance?<eos> You look like a dancer.<eos> That's sweet, but no.<eos> I've been checking all the bars nearby.<eos> I want to know if anyone saw my friend here the other night, hmm?<eos> Oh, yeah, I know him.<eos> He's the guy that killed that actress.<eos> No, no, he didn't.
I knew you'd come around.<eos> I'm not breaking up with him.<eos> He's great, and I think I owe it to myself to see where it goes.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Well, I appreciate your telling me that in person.<eos> I really don't want to hurt you, but I just felt it best to be up front and honest.<eos> Of course.<eos> And I suppose it was a lot of me to ask of you anyway.<eos> So, you understand?<eos> I do. Completely.
I'm...<eos> I've been just so lonely.<eos> I guess I was grasping at anything that would help.<eos> You've gone through times in your life without men before. You've gotten through those, right?<eos> It was different.<eos> I had Zoila then.<eos> Men have come and gone, but Zoila...<eos> She was my constant.<eos> She just needs time. She'll come around.<eos> What if she doesn't?
Only her name.<eos> But the rest of what is coming cannot be seen even as I look right at it.<eos> It is a terrible thing to look at oneself and all the while see nothing.<eos> Hello?<eos> I had arrived in the first few days of August, hired to care for Ms. Blum.<eos> The winter of that year proved to be unseasonably warm, and by February, all that was left of the snow on the sides of the highways had turned mostly black.<eos> It rained too much in the spring, and the fruit in the trees hung heavy at the ends of bent branches.<eos> The sun in the summer months was unreasonably hot and stung my bare shoulders whenever I let it.<eos> I remember thinking that it felt like fall would never come.<eos> And then it never did.
I needed to know how you lived with it.<eos> So, you tracked me down?<eos> You got a job at my favorite restaurant.<eos> You got close to my best friend, and then you rent my studio?<eos> I didn't know that was your favorite restaurant.<eos> - It's true.<eos> - Was this part of the plan?<eos> - No.<eos> This just happened.<eos> No, it didn't.
Baby, look at this.<eos> This is little Boots.<eos> So sweet.<eos> - Little Boots.<eos> - ‭So sweet.<eos> You have something you want to talk about, T?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Eddie.<eos> We got a problem.<eos> We do?
Now all he needs to do is run, and his Speed Force will transfer into this vial. but only as long as I calibrate it.<eos> Get to work.<eos> Wells.<eos> One day... I'm gonna knock that smug expression clean off your face.<eos> So this was your plan all along?<eos> Ever since the skies parted and showed me another world... with another speedster.<eos> Once I saw you, I came here, figured out what I had to do.<eos> How are you still alive?<eos> We saw you die.<eos> You did.
I'll do it.<eos> I'm so sorry I left you.<eos> I had to run after him.<eos> - Rile's waiting outside.<eos> I need to end this.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> You have to.<eos> I shouldn't have put you in this position.<eos> I wanted it.<eos> I still do.
One day this is all gonna fade away.<eos> Just like a bad dream.<eos> But until that day comes, I'm gonna protect you.<eos> Better than one of these ever could.<eos> - You gave him everything<eos> - I didn't give him your badge.<eos> - You lost that on your own.<eos> - Oh, Jesus, come on.<eos> Did it feel good, Mark?<eos> Doing what you did to him?
How was the turnout at service this mornin'?<eos> They'll be back.<eos> Is he there?<eos> Jesus, come on, Rev.<eos> Didn't you do enough damage the other night?<eos> I want him to see me on my feet.<eos> For him to know that I've beat the count. Round two.<eos> You really think he's the devil?<eos> You saw what he did to me.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Sliced himself up pretty good.<eos> If you're finished, you should go home.<eos> You know, Anderson doesn't seem to be gettin' your message.<eos> And what message is that?<eos> Well, that the clock's ticking.<eos> He better pack up his shit and get the fuck out of town before whatever you're here for gets real.<eos> What do you think I'm here for?<eos> Must be big.<eos> Considering what I'm guessing you did to get this house.<eos> And what you did to Anderson.
I think you know.<eos> What is it?<eos> He has Amber.<eos> Kyle, wait.<eos> This is about more than us.<eos> He is a false prophet.<eos> If we don't stop him, the devil will reign for a thousand years.<eos> You really believe that?<eos> That that man is the devil and that you have to stop him, no matter what?<eos> Yes, I do.
Who is he?<eos> Don't know, don't care.<eos> But if he's here, Zoom must need something from him.<eos> So what does Zoom need you for?<eos> That is an excellent question, Caity.<eos> You know, I've been asking myself the same thing.<eos> But doesn't matter now.<eos> I'm not gonna stick around much longer.<eos> Wait, I thought you said your powers don't work inside this cell?<eos> They don't.
Here she comes.<eos> - She hates us.<eos> - Good.<eos> The feeling is mutual.<eos> - Why are they here?<eos> - To help on the case.<eos> He's already pleaded guilty.<eos> What do I need help with?<eos> - You made it.<eos> - Of course I did.
Annalise is still really sick, so if she said something...<eos> What do you need?<eos> Maybe I can help.<eos> Did she teach you how to do this?<eos> How to act the whore in order to play people?<eos> - You're the whore.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> You waited until after you screwed me to show me that gun.<eos> And I fell for it, even thought about breaking the law for you, because I thought I knew you.<eos> But I don't, do I?
I don't care.<eos> Nothing's changed for me.<eos> What I saw in there proves the process works.<eos> Jason's life is worth saving.<eos> You might think you know what you're doing, but you're in denial.<eos> Jason lied to you.<eos> He stood there over your son while he bled out.<eos> Hate won't win.<eos> Don't you get that?<eos> Well, it just did.
We have time.<eos> Mm. Suit yourself.<eos> So, Gibbins is your dad's last name?<eos> No.<eos> They changed my name when I went into foster care.<eos> - Who did?<eos> - My foster family.<eos> They thought it'd help me acclimate.<eos> And you believed that?<eos> No, of course you did. I-I just...
I don't care if you're not talking to Annalise.<eos> You need to get over here.<eos> I can't say why over the phone, but it involves Philip, so call me back.<eos> What?<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - You mean you do?<eos> You said you wanted to know me, even the bad things.<eos> Because I never thought you'd admit - to killing a pregnant sorority girl. - Hey.<eos> Everything that has happened, Sam dying, whatever it is that happened to Rebecca, although something tells me you killed her, too.<eos> - I didn't.
Everything that has happened, Sam dying, whatever it is that happened to Rebecca, although something tells me you killed her, too.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Great.<eos> There's one thing going for you... if I can even believe that.<eos> Why would I lie about that now?<eos> Because you want me to ignore what you did.<eos> That's not what I'm asking for.<eos> Then why are we down here?<eos> To find out if I told Annalise?<eos> Well, I didn't.
What?<eos> No! No one can see this.<eos> I'm not playing with our lives anymore.<eos> Give me the damn computer!<eos> Annalise Keating.<eos> What can I help you with?<eos> Philip Jessup.<eos> Wish I had something.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Now you do.
Will I?<eos> 'Cause I haven't done these like everyone else, who seem to be really good at them.<eos> You will be, too.<eos> And you know why?<eos> Because you're smarter than people think.<eos> Where were you at 8:30 p.m. the night Emily Sinclair was murdered?<eos> Uh, that was a long time ago so I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> - I think you remember.<eos> - Except I don't.
What the hell was that?<eos> - I did you a favor.<eos> - How?<eos> He freaked out at the idea we framed Catherine, so imagine if he knew the truth.<eos> You chopping up Sam's body, for example...<eos> Stop.<eos> Fine.<eos> Just... You're welcome for saving your relationship.<eos> I thought you stopped drinking.<eos> I did.
I would've told you if I were.<eos> Well, since when, then?<eos> Well, we heard that you'd been shot and stopped by to see how you were doing.<eos> So it's all my fault.<eos> I did not say that.<eos> After everything that he's done...<eos> You act like he beat me.<eos> No, the worst thing he did was to move across town.<eos> How do you know he's not gonna leave again?<eos> I don't.
We'll see each other again.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Uh, Oliver's gone rogue.<eos> He's hacking the po-po for A.K.'s warrant.<eos> Oh.<eos> Good. Could've told me that downstairs.<eos> Yeah, I-I know. I just thought maybe we should talk about... you know.<eos> There's nothing to talk about.<eos> Right. Yeah, yeah. We'll just pretend like it never happened.<eos> - Because it didn't.
There's nothing to talk about.<eos> Right. Yeah, yeah. We'll just pretend like it never happened.<eos> - Because it didn't.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> 'Cause, I mean, if, like, Bonnie found out...<eos> She won't, and neither will Caleb, who hopefully isn't dead right now.<eos> Yeah, I do just... I want to say this.<eos> Um... It was bad morally. I feel that.<eos> I just don't want you to think that I didn't... enjoy it.<eos> Because I did... uh, thoroughly.
No.<eos> The party wants someone with experience, and so does the country.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> But... it is an open convention, and so we have to operate with the belief that anything could happen.<eos> I mean, the press is certainly enjoying imagining it.<eos> Well, sure.<eos> It makes for a good story.<eos> Yeah, and it's the kind of coverage that we can't really control.<eos> You know, I mean, these things have a way of taking on a life of their own.<eos> Like the Zoe Barnes story did about my nomination for Secretary of State.

I'm sorry.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> Chip!<eos> Chip, are you in there?<eos> Of course you're not in there.<eos> Why the fuck am I yelling?<eos> This is stupid.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> - Hey. - How'd it go?<eos> It didn't.
You told me you found out this morning.<eos> Yeah, that Chip was drinking again.<eos> Not that he didn't...<eos> - You're saying that you killed...<eos> - Dennis.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> - Don't make a big deal about this.<eos> - Oh, my God. He fucking lied.<eos> Of course he did.
Juliette?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> That looked like...<eos> That was her.<eos> That was Juliette.<eos> How? You told us she was dead.<eos> Her hair was different, the way she moved was different, but it was her, I know it was her.<eos> But she died in your arms, Nick.<eos> You said.<eos> She did.
Oh, my God!<eos> That looked like...<eos> That was her.<eos> That was Juliette.<eos> How? You told us she was dead.<eos> Her hair was different, the way she moved was different, but it was her, I know it was her.<eos> But she died in your arms, Nick.<eos> You said.<eos> She did.<eos> She did.
They sent me on assignment that night.<eos> It wasn't till I got to Bangkok that I heard rumors about them trying to turn a Hexenbiest into a warrior.<eos> But nobody told me if it worked.<eos> It did.<eos> She just took out 20 Wesen who tried to kill me.<eos> By herself?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, somebody does.
Yeah. The Angels, what they did, it released a tremendous amount of energy, and there's fallout, so this whole area is poisoned.<eos> You can heal me, right?<eos> No, I can't, and the closer you get to the blast site, the worse your sickness will become.<eos> How worse?<eos> The last time there was a smiting of this magnitude, lot's wife turned to salt.<eos> Awesome.<eos> All right, Dean, you need to go back.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, no, we got to -- we got to go see if it worked, see if Amara is alive or dead.<eos> We don't.
You know, I actually could use a place to stay.<eos> For a night or two.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I don't think I can afford this place.<eos> Where's home for you?<eos> Panhandle.<eos> What brought you down here?<eos> I came for my son.<eos> - He told me you two had met.<eos> - Yeah, we did.
You were looking for a ride to Tilly's? Yeah, no, it's good.<eos> Good, yeah.<eos> - Who's Tilly? - Just a friend.<eos> - His wife.<eos> - Ex-wife.<eos> Now, she's just a friend.<eos> I thought you weren't divorced yet.<eos> Well, I don't think London wants to hear about this. - Oh, no.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> - Oh, she does.
Um... San Diego.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Let's get that...<eos> San Diego? Yeah.<eos> Your dad, is he in the military?<eos> No.<eos> Did Chip live here with his ex-wife?<eos> What was her name again?<eos> Tilly.<eos> No. No, he didn't.
We both decided it was for the best.<eos> We don't have to worry about him, Francis.<eos> You sound tired.<eos> Make sure you get a full night's sleep tonight.<eos> - Francis? - Yes?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> - Okay, tomorrow.<eos> - You're certain Underwood knew?<eos> - And Walker didn't.
- You said he was a vampire.<eos> Well, don't worry. You're safe here.<eos> No monsters in the White House.<eos> I'll show you where you're staying.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on, Charlie.<eos> - Have you ever been in the Oval?<eos> - Once, when I was a kid.<eos> My Boy Scout troop, we met with Reagan.<eos> Of course they did.
You're saying you didn't blackmail them?<eos> I pressure a lot of people, Tom.<eos> That's part of politics. But never those two.<eos> Danton's parents say LeAnn Harvey came to their house in Miami.<eos> Well, I imagine that's because he wanted LeAnn on the Russian plan.<eos> Then why did she come to him instead of him coming to her?<eos> Look, I'm not gonna get into the weeds on this, but let's just cut to the chase.<eos> The allegations that you're making are just as ludicrous as they were the first time we met.<eos> I had nothing concrete then.<eos> This time I do.
This... is Diamond.<eos> Hey, Nucleus.<eos> You dumbass Level One motherfuckers.<eos> Diamond is a fucking Powers legend.<eos> This one with you?<eos> Yeah, she's my partner.<eos> Is she gonna take a shot at me if I untie her?<eos> Not if she knows what's good for her.<eos> You fuckers really don't know who this is, do you?<eos> He does.
Yeah, he's dead. All his top guys are dead too.<eos> Oh, fuck me.<eos> Dr. Death's with them now.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> It was a Hack.<eos> You're sure?<eos> Well, it couldn't have been a Quantum. He had some kind of tech. Maybe he's a shape shifter.<eos> It looked like Laser, but it wasn't him.<eos> Yeah, we don't know that.<eos> I do.
You ain't black no more.<eos> You blue.<eos> Which is why I can help.<eos> I got access to every fucking thing.<eos> Motherfucker,<eos> I was the call you made when you dropped your first body.<eos> You were the first person to know I fuck with girls.<eos> Now we gonna play each other like this?<eos> Candie didn't know what you meant by "Ghost."<eos> I do.
Previously on "Quantico"...<eos> My son's a greater danger to himself than you know.<eos> - I'm on a rescue mission.<eos> - Who are you trying to rescue?<eos> Ross Edwards.<eos> It's true the world doesn't know where my son is, but neither do you.<eos> Only I do.
You have to be able to confront the doubts and fears that live within all of us.<eos> Because if you can't, you don't stand a chance against the bad guys.<eos> So gather up your stuff.<eos> We're gonna go on a little trip.<eos> Last time we spoke,<eos> I know things got a little heated, but I hope I can count on you.<eos> For what?<eos> Well, in the time of crisis, a group needs a leader, and you're that leader.<eos> I didn't ask for that.<eos> Yeah, well, a leader never does.
I didn't know they were gonna do that.<eos> They told me later that they had to to make it look real.<eos> They said she was gonna be okay, and she was.<eos> And they knew that after I was rescued, I would be taken to Quantico for questioning.<eos> - What?<eos> - I could get them information about the campus... entrances, exits, how many guards.<eos> The more they talked about this attack, the more I knew what I was doing was wrong.<eos> But when I started questioning them, they tried to kill me and I got away.<eos> They never cared about me.<eos> No, they didn't.

No, that is not all that matters.<eos> What matters is your health.<eos> Have you seen a doctor yet?<eos> For what?<eos> Stress?<eos> That's all that this is.<eos> Or anxiety or exhaustion or any of the number of excess pressures they put on us here.<eos> Don't forget I have four weeks on you.<eos> This will pass.<eos> And what if it doesn't, Drew?
Pretty ballsy move, you walking in here that way.<eos> Problem is, you just put one of my best men on the bench, and that's gonna cost me money.<eos> That's not my problem.<eos> It will be if you don't tell me why.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I think you know who I am.<eos> Secretary Hill hired you, uh, twice to take me out, if I remember correctly.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Sure you do.
I'm going to follow those barrels.<eos> Get back to your gravel patch.<eos> Slumber well... knowing you are going to be whipped tomorrow at my command.<eos> What can I say to make you turn around and walk away?<eos> Tell them I did this to you.<eos> They may just pardon you.<eos> - You told her.<eos> - What?<eos> About me.<eos> I didn't!
When's she flying back in again?<eos> She's back in New York, but she asked about you.<eos> - Do you think she likes me?<eos> - She wanted to know if you were retarded.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Fuck her.<eos> What are you doing? Not right here.<eos> Come on, big college man.<eos> Don't you want me?<eos> I do.
And uh, you know, his wife just had a baby and everything.<eos> - If I see someone...<eos> - He asked me. He said...<eos> Do I shoot him?<eos> And I said...<eos> "You shoot the shit out of him. "<eos> Before I got into the Tower, and this is not too nice, I took up a position behind a column at the Academic Center.<eos> And I gave him the I-talian digit.<eos> He fired once at the column and hit it.<eos> But he didn't do it again.
Fucking batshit.<eos> Who, then?<eos> Who did Retro Girl?<eos> Besides you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe half the Hero League for all I know.<eos> Motherfucker.<eos> Remember the question?<eos> ! I had no idea that shit was gonna go down!<eos> I didn't.
I know what was in the fucking letter, Gus.<eos> Applicant is unreliable.<eos> He has a history of instability.<eos> You want me to keep going 'cause I can quote that motherfucker line for line.<eos> That letter was confidential for Mr. Mikey McFarlane's eyes only.<eos> Yeah, well, guess what.<eos> Mikey McFarlane was just in Grand Rapids and he told me how you fucked me, college buddy.<eos> You have any idea what happened to me after I missed out on that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I say we just, uh, put him back in the water.<eos> Okay. Really consider this before you react.<eos> We cut off Milo's hands and we leave him on the boat.<eos> Look, Jesús cuts of hands and feet, right?<eos> Milo's already lost his feet so we just leave him on the boat and then it'll look like a drug deal gone bad.<eos> Then, if somebody finds him, they won't be looking for us and that might buy us some time.<eos> That's... actually... a smart idea.<eos> All right.<eos> This is all I could find.<eos> I did the feet.
So-so come out with your hands up.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Man, give me this.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm giving you three seconds to come out of there or I am going to light this motherfucking closet up, you hear me?<eos> Three, two... One!<eos> Do it, do it.<eos> I can't. I can't.<eos> Hey, buddy, look, we don't want to hurt you.<eos> - I do!
- I left it at the villa.<eos> - So did I.<eos> - Why?<eos> - What do you mean, why?<eos> Why don't you have your passport?<eos> Can we slow the fuck down, please!<eos> Who walks around with their passport in a foreign country?<eos> - I do.<eos> - So do I. Everybody does.<eos> No, they don't.
One of the team left, took off.<eos> It was Joel, right?<eos> Gus.<eos> Why did you think it was Joel?<eos> Cobi, I asked you to manage your team.<eos> Yeah. Um, I know.<eos> Well, you know, I didn't think he was gonna do it.<eos> But then I was pretty sure that, you know, he was gonna come back.<eos> So I'm-I'm not exactly sure if this, like, affects things m-moving forward. Yes.<eos> Yes, it does.
And you know they do, so you use it on them.<eos> I can tell because you give it a little extra.<eos> Hi.<eos> You're aware of it.<eos> If a person were perceptive, they'd be aware that you are aware of it.<eos> Maybe that's all part of it.<eos> A whole other conversation happening with your smile.<eos> Do you want to fuck?<eos> I used to not say what I think.<eos> Now I do.
Jesús.<eos> Right?<eos> Who?<eos> Jesús.<eos> We know that you and your accomplices were involved<eos> - in her murder.<eos> - Okay, look.<eos> You can speculate all you want on that, but you're gonna have to have some pretty hard evidence for that to stand up in court.<eos> - I didn't kill her.<eos> - Then who did?
Don't leave him.<eos> Why?<eos> He... just-just... just give him another chance.<eos> You know?<eos> He loves you.<eos> If you are able to tell us who murdered her and we are able to secure a Case on the strength of your information, then I see no reason why we cannot release you.<eos> Joel Kransey.<eos> You know where he might be?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
We've got...<eos> The Long Surrender. Autumn Conquest.<eos> I needed to have serious books recorded sensibly.<eos> Uh... What about anthropology and sociology?<eos> All that was basically available in the United Kingdom was detective novels and romantic fiction.<eos> Well, I'm interested in reading contemporary social sciences.<eos> No, look, how do blind people read big books?<eos> They said, "They don't."<eos> Anyway, um, I'll sort it out, so thanks for your advice.<eos> They don't.
Frame me for her murder? How will I prove my innocence?<eos> I sent the servants away, Elizabeth.<eos> You have to help me to evade the gallows.<eos> I will do all I can.<eos> We cannot be seen together.<eos> I have my kingdom and the future of my reign to consider.<eos> And our child. Wha...? What of our child?<eos> Elizabeth, that child gives us motive. We could both go to the gallows for Amy's death.<eos> But this child was to be our greatest blessing, and what do I do about it?<eos> Robert, what do I do?
That comes with saying "I do."<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Where'd they come from?<eos> Are we doing the right thing?<eos> I think I'm making progress-- you just got to keep DHS off my tail just a little bit longer.<eos> Yeah?<eos> They must have spotted Vincent coming to the park.<eos> What?<eos> - I don't know how they did it, but he's got to get out of there.<eos> You both do. Now.
She wants to go back to work at the biscuit factory.<eos> She can't do that.<eos> Well, I don't think it's a great idea, but she keeps going on about how they were all very nice to her, the other people, and them that ran it.<eos> I mean, they are a legitimate business.<eos> - It doesn't matter. - What, employing trafficked women?<eos> No, that's...<eos> The people who own it probably don't even realise they are trafficked, they probably were perfectly nice to her.<eos> - The problem is... - How can they not know?<eos> - They don't pay 'em!<eos> - No, they do!
In fact, you could call it Catherine and then next time you get cross with me, you could...<eos> - Throw it at you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, that'd work.<eos> Or I could call it by your nickname.<eos> - That might make me happy.<eos> - Sure! Absolutely.<eos> Except I haven't got one.<eos> - You do! - No...<eos> - Do I?
And all the other stuff, all the lies I got convicted over.<eos> I did not rape Ann Gallagher.<eos> That were Lewis.<eos> It were me that used to bring her Mars bars and let her use t'bucket.<eos> I did not kill that little police girl up on t'moor either.<eos> That were Lewis.<eos> And I had to kill him, cos he come at me with that knife!<eos> - I know.<eos> - But nobody believes me.<eos> I do.
"You have to pay me up front."<eos> And he goes, "I'll pay you after,"<eos> but they only ever say that when they haven't enough.<eos> I said, "Well, it's not happening, then."<eos> But...you know... And I couldn't stop him.<eos> I was struggling but then he had his hand on my throat.<eos> He's pressing down on me, he's inside me without a condom and I can't breathe.<eos> And he's a big fella and I can feel meself going red in t'face.<eos> And he goes, "If you don't stop wriggling, I'm going to shove "a broken bottle up you."<eos> Did he indeed?
You think this is funny?<eos> - All right, get out of here.<eos> - You know where you are?<eos> ! - Get out!<eos> - You know where you are?<eos> ! - Get out. - Do you have any idea where you are?<eos> Get out. Get out of here.<eos> G... they're just stupid kids, man.<eos> I don't know what happened here, Gil.<eos> Nobody does.
And we need to take advantage of it.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> Gil!<eos> Hey, Jessie... hey, you want to do this, all right, he's got a point...<eos> you have to be careful.<eos> I know.<eos> I will.<eos> But we need answers, right?<eos> Yeah. We do.
You know, I'm gonna drive the baby around so he's not fussing.<eos> - Yeah, good.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'll be right back.<eos> - All right. Hey, little man.<eos> So, what do you want to listen to?<eos> Little classical, jazz, some hip-hop?<eos> All right, we'll go with some jazz.<eos> You know why I pulled you over?<eos> No, I don't, Officer.
Emma... the spell's not steady. He can't hear you.<eos> Just tell us where you are.<eos> Something's happening.<eos> It's not holding.<eos> Talk to us.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Killian!<eos> He doesn't know we came for him. We... he doesn't know we're here.<eos> He doesn't know that I care.<eos> Yes, he does.
It was a good joke.<eos> It was funny. No, it wasn't.<eos> Can we start over?<eos> Hi, I'm cat.<eos> Hi--hi, I'm [laughs]-- I'm spencer.<eos> It really is nice to meet you, In person, finally.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> Tell me a little bit about yourself.<eos> Do you really have 3 ph.D.S? Yes.<eos> Um, I--yeah, I do,
One of the data points that her research told me about was age.<eos> I'm, uh, too young to display the chromosomal signs, So I'm just gonna have to... Learn to live not knowing.<eos> [door opens] Oh, my god.<eos> Oh, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. What is happening right now?<eos> You're what's going on.<eos> Right now is what's--<eos> You are here.<eos> Do you know what's happening right now?<eos> It is--it is done. The dirty dozen is done.<eos> Yes, done.
Did you just threaten me?<eos> Oh, I didn't, actually.<eos> That would have looked like this.<eos> Take another step toward me and I'll pluck your vocal cords from your throat and use them to play a rather sporting game of pin the tail on the deputy.<eos> Stop...<eos> Please.<eos> The party was lovely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> When were you going to tell me that you lost your grip on reality?<eos> I just did.
Thank you.<eos> You can go now.<eos> That's it?<eos> You already did what we needed. We?<eos> You're helping her?<eos> You're the easiest way to get to Stefan.<eos> Don't take it personally.<eos> "Don't take it personally"?<eos> I have a family, Matt.<eos> So did I, and a girlfriend and a life.
I think so.<eos> Yes, here it is.<eos> Why?<eos> I was just thinking i would pay him a visit.<eos> Well, suit yourself.<eos> Yes.<eos> A nice little visit.<eos> It's the least I can do for one of my fans.<eos> So, how'd it go?<eos> It didn't.
Your father begged me to trade in the theater tickets so we could go to the casino instead.<eos> You know how that's his favorite thing, so we did that. And he was so happy, too.<eos> But I have to tell you, I couldn't stop thinking about you and all that happened today.<eos> So look, I have a thought.<eos> This show isn't going anywhere anytime soon, right?<eos> So, what I was thinking was, well, maybe we can make it back here later in the month to see it ourselves, you know?<eos> Solo tu y yo. And believe it or not, your father actually won some money tonight, so he can pay for everything.<eos> That'll teach him.<eos> I know how much you wanted to see it, mijita, and what it means to you.<eos> Everybody does.
yeah. What'd you expect?<eos> She's a vampire.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> just like you did before.<eos> you and I.<eos> How do you know I don't want to stake you?<eos> Do you?<eos> I do.
Liz!<eos> Navabi.<eos> What's that, son?<eos> The pass code-- it is "Navabi."<eos> It's "Navabi"!<eos> Open the door.<eos> N-A-V-A-B-I.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Open the door!<eos> Do it!
- I don't care.<eos> - I do.<eos> You've done enough.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I opened the door.<eos> Agent Mojtabai, stand down.<eos> Aram. Aram, look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I don't blame you for letting me out.<eos> I don't.
He seemed to know you.<eos> Did he? I don't know.<eos> I've never seen him before in my life.<eos> What, are you jealous?<eos> No, I'm upset, all right?<eos> I tried to surprise you with a nice anniversary party.<eos> Yeah, you surprised me, all right.<eos> It obviously didn't please you.<eos> I don't want to talk about this right now, Evan, it's late.<eos> Well, I do.
In China.<eos> A place I knew his supporters would not travel to.<eos> I took the throne from under him.<eos> They say I cheated.<eos> I don't think it's wholly the election Kaidu's after, but humiliation.<eos> He wants to shame me.<eos> Disgrace my name.<eos> Would he be justified in his quest?<eos> I want you to know who it is you're protecting.<eos> I do.
I panicked.<eos> And after Robyn went to jail, I just...<eos> I felt so guilty.<eos> Is that why you started N.B.P.?<eos> I thought maybe I could help Robyn, somehow make a difference.<eos> Except she found out the truth, confronted you, and that's why you killed her.<eos> I didn't kill Robyn.<eos> I-I didn't even know she found out the truth.<eos> Look, Linda, it's time to come clean.<eos> I just did.
Come on.<eos> Well, I went to MIT, but I didn't study a lick of magic in school.<eos> - This is brilliant.<eos> - Magic is science.<eos> Hard to crack on your own, but far from impossible, if you have the natural bent.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, sometimes, I wonder if I do... have it naturally.<eos> What if it's all just one big party trick that never adds up to anything?<eos> So?<eos> What if it doesn't?
But the killer...<eos> Do you remember what I said to you early on in this case?<eos> Money never lies.<eos> Debt is the black heart of this crime.<eos> I feel it.<eos> To the murder site!<eos> Do you think you've been clever?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - You told her about Sally.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Scrofula, that's it.<eos> Great purple blotches, swellings of the neck.<eos> Since the trial, you would not know him.<eos> I cannot tell if it's because Ross was saved or if something happened while he was in Bodmin.<eos> He shared your room the night before the trial.<eos> Did you notice any strangeness in mood or behaviour?<eos> Not that I can recall.<eos> From something he said, I had the feeling...<eos> You may think me callous or hysterical, but I could almost believe that Francis had intended to kill himself.<eos> Did he?
- Our house in London.<eos> Caroline will want the latest thing.<eos> She can well afford it.<eos> I wonder whether it shouldn't be Wyatt?<eos> His Pantheon in Oxford Street has pleasing dimensions.<eos> Perhaps you'd better secure the lady before you start spending her fortune.<eos> Mr Aukitt.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Remind me, you still have shares in Wheal Leisure?<eos> Yes, I do.
Or at least until Prudie do kill 'im again!<eos> Jud's alive?<eos> What happened?<eos> How?<eos> Oh, ask me tomorrow.<eos> I'm weary to the bone.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I did see him with my own eyes.<eos> Elizabeth looked well tonight.<eos> She did.
So, captain of the football team and the prom king.<eos> Can we make a quick stop?<eos> Do you have to pee?<eos> I begged you not to drink so much.<eos> No, I want to go to Bethlehem.<eos> - Pennsylvania?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's where Andre Hannan is. He's on death row.<eos> - You want to go see him?<eos> - I do.
Bird pun not intended.<eos> And while he does dabble in tech, there is one thing he can't resist...<eos> Rare paintings.<eos> Specifically, rare stolen paintings.<eos> Found myself breaking a lot of laws since working for the FBI, but here's a new one:<eos> art forgery.<eos> You know, Bob Ross always made it look so easy.<eos> Happy trees, happy clouds.<eos> Bob didn't paint psychologically disturbing naked people.<eos> Well, Winton Miller did.
He's gone rogue.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - These are for you.<eos> You're gonna put them on, and then you're gonna tell me what the hell is going on between you and Senator Morra.<eos> Rebecca! Hi.<eos> My name is Rebecca Harris, and you're probably wondering why a bullet is coming my way at about 1,900 miles an hour.<eos> I wasn't raised for gunplay.<eos> In fact, I grew up in a creative household, surrounded by art and laughter.<eos> If things had kept going the way they started, I'd probably still be making pictures today.<eos> They didn't, though.
He's in Canada, huh?<eos> Wh... Where?<eos> Sit down.<eos> I cannot sleep, okay?<eos> Not with everything in disarray.<eos> Sit.<eos> Down.<eos> You're angry with me, huh?<eos> You don't want to get into this with me right now.<eos> I do.
Wh... Where?<eos> Sit down.<eos> I cannot sleep, okay?<eos> Not with everything in disarray.<eos> Sit.<eos> Down.<eos> You're angry with me, huh?<eos> You don't want to get into this with me right now.<eos> I do.<eos> No, you don't.
-l'm sure he's coming, Lynda.<eos> I'll try his office again.<eos> - Director's line.<eos> - Dr. Huffnagel here.<eos> I'm sorry to call again, but I'm here with Lynda.<eos> - She's wondering if Peter is on his way.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> The Director got to your office two minutes ago.<eos> No.<eos> He didn't.
- Oh, my God.<eos> - Oh, your God can't help you now, Peter.<eos> You're traveling over the Atlantic, on the Venezuelan president's airbus...<eos> -...on your way to the Hague.<eos> - You're insane.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> But you're going to have the distinguished honor of becoming the first American official ever to be charged with even a single war crime let alone the slew of them you will undoubtedly be accused of before the week is out.<eos> The United States isn't party to the Rome treaty.<eos> - We don't recognize its authority.<eos> - But Venezuela does.
He's got the juice to call this kinda meeting.<eos> What, 'cause we roughed him up a little bit?<eos> Seems like a bitch move.<eos> It is totally and absolutely unacceptable.<eos> It is totally and absolutely unacceptable.<eos> If someone can't pay We sit down, we discuss it<eos> Like civilized men And women, no?<eos> ...Doña venganza,<eos> You need to teach them a lesson.<eos> All the lords do.
Really?<eos> Because I'm not your people, remember?<eos> You never gave a shit about me or this place,<eos> About what we've built.<eos> Richard, we are flunkies.<eos> All right? We go to mid-bosses and we beg for money.<eos> This place is built on bad blood, On the body of a dead kid.<eos> So we're going to go there again.<eos> I didn't kill kate.<eos> Carlos did.
Emilio.<eos> It's official.<eos> Calavera was one of the captured.<eos> We sentenced him to the labyrinth centuries ago.<eos> Inside the temple of the eternal feast.<eos> The twister?<eos> Yes, the twister.<eos> It was destroyed six moons ago by carlos madrigal.<eos> The skull keeper did not escape from hell, He escaped from our prison.<eos> They all did.
Daddy.<eos> They're not gonna die tonight, right?<eos> I told you, Felicity.<eos> You don't have to concern yourself with these things Felicity.<eos> Are ya fucking deaf?<eos> Philip!<eos> Philip!<eos> Philip!<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yes ya do.
That's my sweet Felicity.<eos> No matter what the cost.<eos> No matter what the cost.<eos> I'm a real sumbitch dad.<eos> Don't you dare disrespect your...<eos> Thank you Philip.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> Y'all know how to read?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You do?
They're just... they're gonna need a little more from you than Lobos; that's all.<eos> And like I said, you want Lobos, I will give him to you, but anything beyond that is on you people.<eos> As soon as Nunez returns, I'm taking my information, and I'm leaving.<eos> I'd strongly advise against that.<eos> You would, huh?<eos> Why is that?<eos> 'Cause I know you ordered the murder of Nomar Arcielo, and I know you had Tommy Egan do it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I didn't kill anyone, and I don't even know who that is.<eos> Yes, you do.
All right, gents, change of plans.<eos> Scott, you and I will take out the cult monkeys and surround the redhead.<eos> Professor, you create a diversion.<eos> [Amaru] On your feet.<eos> My Queen... we did not expect you.<eos> Itzpa serves me well.<eos> A true daughter of Xibalba.<eos> She says you have something special for me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, of course we do.
Oh my God, who writes this shit?<eos> We still have no idea how to kill these things.<eos> First, we gotta find 'em.<eos> If Scott leads them back to the band, I've got the license plate number to their tour bus.<eos> I can call it in.<eos> Well, what the fuck are you waitin' for?<eos> Go!<eos> I don't think he likes taking orders from me.<eos> Little secret? Mmm.<eos> Nobody does.
You took her from the neighbors, 'cause they always kept her chained up. Remember that?<eos> - I was so bummed when she ran away.<eos> - Yeah, well...<eos> She didn't run away.<eos> I found her in the orchard one day.<eos> She was all bitten up by rats. Covered in blood, foaming' at the mouth, all right? So, I ran, I got Dad, and I...<eos> Are you fucking with me right now?<eos> - Dad shot Peaches?<eos> - No.<eos> I did.
That's adultery.<eos> You heard me wrong.<eos> I didn't have sex with Tanya.<eos> I was just joking, you know?<eos> Just guy stuff.<eos> No, no, no, no, no!<eos> No. Ohh, ohh...<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Actions have consequences.<eos> I didn't do it.
Why?<eos> To tell you what the decision is.<eos> But that's already been decided.<eos> It is, but you're supposed to get the call, before the letter.<eos> Well, is he gonna change his mind?<eos> No, the call's just to discuss the decision.<eos> Well, I know what the decision is, I've got the letter here in front of us.<eos> D'you want us to read it to you?<eos> But he should have called you first.<eos> But he didn't.
Readings are good.<eos> Looks like your sprint alignment is balancing out.<eos> You know, I've been thinking...<eos> I'm gonna need a name, aren't I?<eos> You got a problem with Martinez?<eos> Come on, you know what I mean.<eos> I'm not here just so you can pimp my ride or to help you around the house.<eos> It's time to get back to shit that matters.<eos> Yeah, Special Forces certainly doesn't make a habit of putting gimps back in the action.<eos> No, they sure as hell don't.
I can't go and see him. It is the worst moment of his life, and I'm not there for him.<eos> Well, you will be when you can.<eos> On top of all that, I don't know what my dad's gonna do when he gets there.<eos> You called your dad?<eos> Rachel, I don't think that was a good idea.<eos> Well, I couldn't just sit here and do nothing.<eos> Mike's been arrested.<eos> Jessica's talking about unindicted co-conspirators.<eos> Okay, well then, he and Harvey will just have to work it out.<eos> And what if they don't?
They did that song, "If You Leave."<eos> It was in... "Pretty in Pink"<eos> - in the last scene, when Andie...<eos> - Jules.<eos> My guess is that it's an encoded message.<eos> I think McCarthy's telling Slavich that he needs help getting out of the country.<eos> Slavich's next shift starts in four hours.<eos> We're gonna take a team, stake it out, see if McCarthy shows.<eos> Abby Carroll may turn up with McCarthy.<eos> And if she does?
It killed him.<eos> - "It"?<eos> - The poltergeist.<eos> It's in the house.<eos> So you're saying an evil spirit... pinned your husband to the wall with swords?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you didn't hear anything?<eos> I've been... taking a tonic to help me sleep. Why didn't the poltergeist kill you, too?<eos> I don't... I don't know.<eos> I do.
You're going to love it.<eos> An apartment.<eos> That's right.<eos> It's going to be so much better than this big, creaky...<eos> There's something you're not telling me. No.<eos> There isn't.<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I do.
Then you're gonna have to tell me the truth about everything. Right now.<eos> And it's not going to be protected by attorney-client privilege, and you're going to have to trust that I'm not going to turn you in.<eos> I was never worried that you were going to turn me in.<eos> I was worried about putting you in a position where you had to lie.<eos> But I was ready to tell you that night anyway, so I might as well tell you now.<eos> Rachel, what's going on?<eos> I just got a call.<eos> They took Donna down to the US Attorney's office.<eos> We have to get down there right now.<eos> No, we don't.
Harvey?<eos> I need to ask you to do something.<eos> Of course, Donna. I'd do anything for you.<eos> Well, it isn't for me.<eos> It's for my father.<eos> He wanted to know if you would consider investing in his real estate project.<eos> I'm sorry. I can't do that.<eos> You just said that you would do anything for me.<eos> I meant I'd consider anything.<eos> And I just did.
You're goddamn right that's what she's doing.<eos> But that's not all she's doing.<eos> Because from the second that she found out about you, she's had to lie for you and she's still treated you like family and it cost her everything.<eos> Give me a break.<eos> Until now, it didn't cost her anything.<eos> You better watch yourself.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> It cost her her relationship with me!<eos> You didn't know about that, did you?<eos> Well, now, you do.
You didn't know about that, did you?<eos> Well, now, you do.<eos> So, you'll destroy that if I give you mine?<eos> I'm an attorney.<eos> I can't destroy evidence.<eos> But you?<eos> You can do whatever you want.<eos> You trust me to do that?<eos> (SCOFFS) No, Mike.<eos> Jessica does.
The guy you saw in court.<eos> Yes.<eos> His name is David Green.<eos> He must have told Gibbs about me, and then she used that to get the Dean to strong-arm Rachel.<eos> That's abuse of power.<eos> I told you, the only problem with that theory is,<eos> David Green tells Gibbs about you and his career is done.<eos> Then he must have told her anonymously.<eos> Which doesn't help us, because we still don't have any proof that she contacted the Dean.<eos> No, we don't.
And Harvey wasn't gonna tell me because he's playing dirty.<eos> He's not your enemy, Mike.<eos> He's just doing what he thinks is best.<eos> Then I'm gonna do what I think is best.<eos> And what exactly is that?<eos> Donna, he may not be my enemy, and you may not be my enemy, but as long as we're in this trial run, I'm not trusting you with anything.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> Jessica Pearson,<eos> I wasn't aware we had an appointment today.<eos> We don't.
- Your Honor.<eos> Let me rephrase.<eos> Is Ms. Griffith going to be perjuring herself or are you?<eos> Yeah, I was jealous of him.<eos> And if he lied about all of that, what's to make us believe that he wasn't lying about everything else?<eos> No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Your Honor, prosecution calls Donna Paulsen to the stand.<eos> Don't worry, Donna.<eos> She won't ask you point-blank if you knew Mike was a fraud.<eos> What if she does?
Don't worry, Donna.<eos> She won't ask you point-blank if you knew Mike was a fraud.<eos> What if she does?<eos> If you lie, they'll never know.<eos> Ms. Paulsen, it's my understanding that you arranged<eos> Mr. Specter's interviews for the position currently filled by Michael Ross.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> I assisted in the process, yes.<eos> Did you find it suspicious that Mr. Ross wasn't listed on the Harvard class ranking from his first year?<eos> - No, I didn't.
- What's on your mind, Donna? - Nothing.<eos> I guess I just never thought I'd see the day when you thought Harvey was gonna lose.<eos> And who says I think Harvey's going to lose?<eos> - A mistrial says it.<eos> - No, it says I'm not willing to take a chance on 12 complete strangers.<eos> It says you don't have faith in him.<eos> Donna, you don't know what you're saying. Don't I?<eos> I know I'm not a lawyer, but isn't it true that if Mike gets found innocent, there's no double jeopardy, but if a mistrial happens, they might come after him again one day?<eos> Yes, Donna, that is true, but Harvey and I are banking that never happens.<eos> - And what if it does?
- behind Harvey's back.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> I already had it to his face.<eos> Tried to get him to do the right thing and turn himself in, but he wouldn't.<eos> I'm not going to convince him to do that.<eos> I know, because he'll never be convinced.<eos> Which is why we need to go to Gibbs together...<eos> - Goddamn it, Jessica, we don't have any time!<eos> Did it ever occur to you that if Mike gets found guilty, the first thing Harvey is going to do is walk in there and take the bullet for me and you?<eos> - No, it didn't.
So you want to turn yourself in because some cheater called you a bully?<eos> No, Donna, I want to turn myself in because he was right. I'm not unbeatable.<eos> No, Harvey, I think he made you feel guilty, and now you're not seeing clearly.<eos> Donna...<eos> Harvey, if it were anybody other than Mike on trial and you saw his closing, do you think that the jury would convict him?<eos> I don't know, Donna, but I can't afford to be wrong about this.<eos> Then let me as you a question:<eos> Why aren't you talking to Dr. Agard about this?<eos> - How do you know about her?<eos> - Because I do.
He has me hold his phone.<eos> Says it messes up the lines in his suit.<eos> I have nothing to confess to you.<eos> Oh, that.<eos> I wasn't really interested in hearing it.<eos> Although I suppose life in the abbey must be full of intrigue.<eos> What I am interested in is a proposition.<eos> Care to hear it?<eos> RICHARDS: You have a job for The Vehm?<eos> I do.
What you're proposing requires trust.<eos> We have none.<eos> None of my clients do, which is why you, like all my clients, must swear to uphold and enforce not only this merger, but all mergers brokered with my assistance.<eos> Here is my client list.<eos> They are powerful and well-armed.<eos> Should either of you betray the other, they will destroy your families.<eos> You'll want some time to think it over.<eos> I do hope you see the merit in my proposal.<eos> We do so love a wedding.<eos> Yes, we do. Yes, we do. Yes, we do.
She's not going anywhere.<eos> Oh, for God's sake.<eos> I knew it.<eos> He's your informant.<eos> That's why you have so much juice, why they let you off.<eos> Isn't that right, comrade Rostova?<eos> I told you not to call me that.<eos> Comrade--<eos> Mr. Pitt and I have a plane to catch.<eos> We most certainly do not.
Josephine, no.<eos> I bought this flat four years ago.<eos> So that some day I could bring you here to the scene of your crime.<eos> Josephine Molire.<eos> Now, listen...<eos> Josephine's father was the most prolific criminal arms dealer in Eastern Europe.<eos> But for all his success, he had a problem, an enemy.<eos> An aggressive and lethal competitor named Stockwell.<eos> I had nothing to do with what happened to that poor girl--<eos> Yes, you did.
Call me when it's done.<eos> LIZ: I want him gone.<eos> - He's here for your protection.<eos> I don't want his protection any more than I want your money.<eos> RAYMOND: The money isn't for you.<eos> LIZ: It's very generous.<eos> I can appreciate that it comes from a place of concern.<eos> But it's dirty money, and I just don't want it.<eos> I don't need it.<eos> No, but your child does.
Understandable.<eos> But i assure you, you have nothing to fear.<eos> Unless... That is, you're hiding something.<eos> Raymond reddington.<eos> I saw him.<eos> You brought him here.<eos> No, i...<eos> Does he know about me?<eos> What i've done?<eos> Does... He...
Yes.<eos> Irina Velov?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - This is for you.<eos> It's from your father.<eos> He told me you're estranged.<eos> And my name's Elizabeth, by the way.<eos> He couldn't find you, so--<eos> Anyway, he says it explains everything.<eos> Yes, it does.
Rubber--<eos> - My, what a dear, sweet child.<eos> - How did you get in here?<eos> With the seven-figure donation that built this wing.<eos> The grasp of these tiny fingers...<eos> I'd forgotten.<eos> I understand we'll be working together to find the man who took Elizabeth.<eos> - You took her from me.<eos> - No.<eos> Alexander Kirk did.
Captain, there's no reading for me to lock onto.<eos> The alien must be generating some sort of sensor shroud.<eos> Sir?<eos> Playing a hunch.<eos> No!<eos> Ensign. You're supposed to be off-duty right now.<eos> Sorry, captain.<eos> I couldn't sleep.<eos> Our visitor leaves a strong impression.<eos> Yes, it does.
I've been able to detect several hearts beating at different rates.<eos> No lungs.<eos> Very high salt levels... and that's it.<eos> There's just not enough data.<eos> I am perplexed by its biology as well.<eos> The exoskeleton is quite formidable.<eos> Complex living polymer chains interwoven with infrangible metals and minerals.<eos> I am not able to calculate how it propels itself at... such high velocities, although obviously it does.<eos> Nor am I able determine how it survives the vacuum of space, but...<eos> But obviously it does.
But you are also half-human. Aren't you?<eos> - I am, admiral.<eos> - Mister Spock...<eos> As a student, you were accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.<eos> - A tremendous honor.<eos> - Affirmative.<eos> Yet you turned down admission.<eos> Did your "human emotions" play a role in that decision?<eos> No sir.<eos> They did not.
We acknowledge and respect your culture's beliefs.<eos> - But I must tell you...<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> I'm well aware that my people's prejudices are hopelessly outdated by modern standards.<eos> I appreciate that you recognize that, sir.<eos> A large faction on Tellar Prime argues against our government's stance on this matter.<eos> And I, for one, am part of that faction.<eos> I believe one of your greatest human writers once said...<eos> "A lady's 'verily' is as potent as a lord's."<eos> That he did, sir.
And I don't want it in my house, not with my kids.<eos> We'll take care of it.<eos> Elizabeth, your mother died.<eos> We had someone with her.<eos> She wasn't alone.<eos> And she spoke of you and Paige, wanted to send a message that she loved you.<eos> Did she?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Did she really say that?<eos> Of course she did.
I did what he wanted.<eos> I'm sorry I ever went anywhere near him.<eos> You don't seem sorry.<eos> Ready?<eos> Who was the... Other one?<eos> Who was the... First one?<eos> Mark, when I was, um, in eighth grade.<eos> He used to come over.<eos> How did it... Start?<eos> It just did.
Why were Mateo and his friends expelled?<eos> That's not your business.<eos> If it affects us, then we have a right to know.<eos> Mateo was defending us.<eos> No, he wasn't.<eos> He was defending one of us.<eos> Evy was being harassed.<eos> Mateo was protecting her.<eos> S-she doesn't deserve suspension.<eos> Those black boys do.
I came in, there was no one.<eos> And your wife had just let me in.<eos> Why did she open the door?<eos> She thought it was me.<eos> I'm telling you straight.<eos> I went to the bathroom door and called the kid.<eos> Then she started screaming.<eos> - I took off.<eos> - You went in.<eos> I didn't.
The lies, the accusations.<eos> Our son was damaged, and right now, I need to focus on Kevin,<eos> I need to work on my family, I...<eos> I need to work on me.<eos> I did things that I don't admire in other people.<eos> But here is where I need to start rebuilding.<eos> You know, this has all... It's all played out very publicly, and when things...<eos> It... it doesn't make it any easier<eos> - to focus on what you need to focus on.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Are you thinking about coming back to Leyland?<eos> No.<eos> Everything going all right for you at Marshall?<eos> Yeah, it's all right.<eos> It's just, I heard they were having a lot of problems at that school.<eos> Some kind of a riot or something?<eos> Taylor, I have to say, I thought you got a...<eos> I thought the school could have handled your situation better.<eos> I see things here sometimes, and... I just think you deserve better than how you were treated.<eos> A lot of us do.
I'm okay. Well, I-I-I've been calling. Y-You didn't pick up.<eos> I didn't feel like talking.<eos> You still want me to come out there, right?<eos> I very... very much want you to come out here.<eos> Good, good.<eos> Look, I'm boarding from New York right now. I'll take a direct flight to Indy.<eos> Just... breathe.<eos> I'm going into work.<eos> No, n-no. - Mm, yeah. - Don't...<eos> Don't do that.
You and Dad, you came. It can be different.<eos> Remember...<eos> Remember when you and me were gonna ride our bikes all the way to Chicago?<eos> - Stop it.<eos> Grabbed a box of cereal, bottle of water, threw them in a backpack?<eos> We got about a mile...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Shut up.<eos> We got about a mile, and then it got too dark for us to see anything, and you told me to turn around.<eos> And we did.
No. No, I hit traffic on my way up.<eos> By the time I got there, they were closed, and I had to turn around empty-handed.<eos> Thought Ellen would be pissed, but if you're asking me for an alibi, you must really have no idea who did this.<eos> We were wondering how you felt about the pregnancy.<eos> The what?<eos> Your wife was almost two months pregnant,<eos> Mr. Jacobs, despite her tubal ligation.<eos> You didn't know, did you?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Jennifer and I adopted.<eos> I had a vasectomy 20 years ago.<eos> Megan...<eos> Ellen, she had her tubes tied.<eos> Then last month, she told me what had happened. She was... pregnant.<eos> She was gonna... she was gonna keep it.<eos> So you killed her?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> I miss something? You already close another case?<eos> As a matter of fact, Detective, you did.
Evan Berner.<eos> What about him?<eos> You tell us.<eos> Uh, he was working a case for me.<eos> He got cold feet; he took off.<eos> He was found torched in his car yesterday.<eos> Are you messing with me right now?<eos> No.<eos> You have anybody in custody?<eos> No, we don't.
No dice, so I was just waiting for him to come forward.<eos> I think you're lying to cover your ass.<eos> What?<eos> Who the hell are you to talk to me like that?<eos> You let his sister think she was looking at ten years and a felony charge on a dime bag.<eos> And you let Evan step into her shoes.<eos> I'm gonna talk to you however the hell I want to talk to you.<eos> You flip the minnows to get to the sharks.<eos> Do you even know how Narcotics works?<eos> - Actually, I do.
- What?<eos> Ryder?<eos> Come here, sweetie.<eos> - Mommy. - Hey. Hey.<eos> He's a cute kid.<eos> You ever want to see him again?<eos> So these are copies of what I submitted to the Ivory Tower.<eos> My NPR and a To-From to my commander and a closing report.<eos> It lays out what I did...<eos> And what I didn't do.
It's about winning, about providing society with superior things, and about proving that you have taste, and good values and you work hard.<eos> And what a wonderful relief, every so often, to know who the enemy is.<eos> Because in the garden, the enemy is everything.<eos> The aphids, the weather, time.<eos> And so you pour yourself into it, care so much, and see up close so much birth, and growth, and beauty, and danger, and triumph.<eos> And then everything dies anyway, right?"<eos> --"But you just keep doing it."<eos> Washington showed me this when I started the garden.<eos> She thought I'd like it.<eos> I do.
Are we not gonna address the coffee issue?<eos> Jefferson... were you there, in the cafeteria?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Was there an altercation? Did...<eos> Did Washington provoke him in some way?<eos> What are you asking me?<eos> If she deserved to die?<eos> No!<eos> There were conflicting reports with some key witnesses claiming she had a weapon.<eos> Man, like hell she did!
Shit.<eos> Here it is.<eos> --Pop his ass!<eos> You like that?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Shoot him!<eos> You like that? Huh?<eos> Come on, girl!<eos> Come on!<eos> Just do it!
Here it is.<eos> --Pop his ass!<eos> You like that?<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Shoot him!<eos> You like that? Huh?<eos> Come on, girl!<eos> Come on!<eos> Just do it!<eos> Do it!
It's a who.<eos> What the hell is this place?<eos> I was hoping one of you could tell me.<eos> - That's...<eos> - Ed Clark. Turner's had him here right under our noses since his murder.<eos> Why?<eos> Maggie: I didn't know anything about this chamber.<eos> This is your lab!<eos> How could you not know?<eos> - 'Cause I didn't.
Get out of my way. Camille!<eos> How wonderful to see you.<eos> And with my Linus.<eos> Yes, it is a treat to see you, Camille.<eos> We came to see this hovel you left us for.<eos> - He doesn't mean that.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> So you don't like it?<eos> He likes it.<eos> We both do.
Noted.<eos> Noted.<eos> Miss Baptiste, you are a legend at the agency.<eos> And you, Mr. Blair, are an unknown.<eos> Your reputation for plain talks is not for nothing.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> For?<eos> Effective immediately, you're promoted to acting director of the Stitchers Program.<eos> Not sure I want the job.<eos> Sure you do.
I'm speaking to you.<eos> Please don't stand there like a half-wit.<eos> She worries about you.<eos> Oh, not about me.<eos> About herself.<eos> She wants to get her hands on this house.<eos> Pack me off to watch Wheel of Fortune and drool with other unloved old people.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> She seemed nice.<eos> Of course she did.
Fine, but guess what?<eos> He gets to feel shitty for the rest of his natural life.<eos> Oh, and beyond when he's a tandoori skewer in hell.<eos> What if he's just like a regular person who made a mistake?<eos> Right?<eos> I mean, come on, we both know I'm not innocent.<eos> Yeah, but you never--<eos> Okay, you did... shoot a human being with a hunting rifle.<eos> But she had it coming.<eos> No, she didn't.
So I need you to send a team to the island to make sure that they're all right.<eos> Just do it.<eos> I'm suspending Agent Patterson, effective immediately.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Her actions resulted in a man's death.<eos> She's not responsible for what happened to that boy.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The moment she left this office with those files, she broke the law.<eos> She had my permission.<eos> Did she?
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.<eos> I'm dropping it.<eos> Matthew Weitz, Assistant U.S. Attorney.<eos> We spoke on the phone.<eos> Whoever's listening to me right now, I know you're there.<eos> Call me.<eos> You want to tell me why a federal prosecutor's bugging my apartment?<eos> Is it better or worse when you thought I was CIA? - No, no.<eos> You have no right...<eos> - Actually, I do.
What?<eos> Remember who?<eos> The man who just tried to kill me and my entire team.<eos> Cade.<eos> - It has to be Cade.<eos> - Start talking.<eos> He's one of our founding members.<eos> Integral to the design of this plan.<eos> We should have paid attention to the warning signs, but his strengths outweigh his flaws.<eos> - Till they didn't.
Activating fire suppression system.<eos> Go!<eos> Go, go, go, go!<eos> Run! Run!<eos> We're in.<eos> Now what?<eos> Okay, those wire bundles control the communication going in and out of the building.<eos> Phone, cable, Internet.<eos> Okay, how do we know which ones to disable?<eos> You don't.
Appearances can be deceiving, given the fact that radiation damage is almost entirely internal.<eos> Well, almost.<eos> Aside from the superficial scarring and the lifelong elevated risk of rare mutation-based cancers, I'm surprisingly healthy.<eos> And what about your previous situation?<eos> Oh, "The Company" has not come knocking.<eos> Perks of being called a player in the story of the century.<eos> So can't take me off the grid.<eos> It's good to see you, Caleb. How you feeling, buddy?<eos> Good to see you, too.<eos> - How you doing, man?
And what about your previous situation?<eos> Oh, "The Company" has not come knocking.<eos> Perks of being called a player in the story of the century.<eos> So can't take me off the grid.<eos> It's good to see you, Caleb. How you feeling, buddy?<eos> Good to see you, too.<eos> - How you doing, man?<eos> Ryan, how was D.C.?<eos> Well, I briefed Congress, who seems to think that I know exactly what happened.<eos> Still not sure I do, but...
So let's figure this out.<eos> What is Caleb Brown's weakness?<eos> This is gonna be the easiest case I have ever tried.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> The defendant has a history of arrest for robbing high-end houses while working as a cater waiter.<eos> Sadie Beakman caught her in the act and the defendant killed her in order to get away.<eos> Isn't that all circumstantial?<eos> Yes, which is why it's a good thing I have you...<eos> An eyewitness. The defendant really should've taken that plea deal I offered.<eos> Yeah. Why didn't she?
But you didn't leave it, did you?<eos> You can see on the tape that we did.<eos> Sure, and then once you stopped recording, you went back to get it.<eos> Over a billion dollars in cash went missing during the Iraq invasion.<eos> What's a lousy $5 mil?<eos> You couldn't just leave it, could you?<eos> Yeah, that's exactly what I did.<eos> Except Sadie didn't, did she?<eos> No.<eos> She didn't.
Sure, yeah.<eos> Uh, when was the last time you heard from Claire?<eos> Two days ago.<eos> She called me from her lunch break.<eos> Did she sound upset or under duress?<eos> She seemed fine.<eos> Her usual upbeat self.<eos> When did you realize that something was wrong?<eos> Usually Claire would beat me home from work.<eos> But that day she didn't.
Wednesday morning, and the cause of death appears to be multiple lacerations, but of course, the autopsy report is practically illegible.<eos> Dolls picked a great time to go AWOL.<eos> Uh, I need to see the body.<eos> So, is this strip poker?<eos> I'm not shy.<eos> - No, you're engaged.<eos> - Maybe we can bet just pennies.<eos> I think I'm more comfortable with pennies.<eos> Is it true that everybody has a tell?<eos> Well, I most certainly do not.
He blew my magic right back at me.<eos> Milah...<eos> I couldn't stop it.<eos> She's gone.<eos> Milah.<eos> Milah was here?<eos> Milah?<eos> She helped us get to you.<eos> Hades has much to answer for.<eos> Indeed he does.
We're not a sideshow for tourists.<eos> Your work relies on the delicate balance of good will, which I must maintain.<eos> Here you have French bureaucracy against British foreign interest against Egyptian home rule.<eos> The country is a powder barrel and you sit above it, flicking matches at whomsoever displeases you.<eos> I don't care cos I'm not a bloody diplomat.<eos> I would never have said you were.<eos> May I remind you that neither of us will ever discover anything more important or wonderful than what is in that desert?<eos> - If only everyone felt the same way.<eos> - Yes, well, they should.<eos> But they don't.
I trusted you.<eos> Trusted both of you.<eos> I will never forgive that man!<eos> "That man"?<eos> For God's sake, Papa!<eos> This is Carter you're talking about!<eos> You have known him for 15 years.<eos> He is your best friend.<eos> He went behind my back!<eos> No, he did not!
It's adorable.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Kira.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> Felix's real sister.<eos> Real sister?<eos> How?<eos> Uh, we have the same father.<eos> I thought you didn't have a father.<eos> Well, I didn't, but now I do.
MK?<eos> I'm here.<eos> MK?<eos> You said you'd meet me in person. - He's Topside.<eos> - What?<eos> Rachel's contact, he did their wet work, their cleaning.<eos> - Is he your source?<eos> - Yeah, I made a decision.<eos> Sometimes you have to work with people you don't like.<eos> No, we don't.
- Hey- - Hey-<eos> MK didn't show.<eos> If MK shut you down, I'm sure she had good cause.<eos> I'm out of options, Dizzy.<eos> I need you to help me find her.<eos> You keep banging on my door asking for favors.<eos> You ever think about what I might want?<eos> All right, what?<eos> I need to know exactly what's going on between you and this twin of yours.<eos> - No, you don't.
Please be kind to Ira.<eos> CASTOR was never completely under my control, to be raised homogeneously like that.<eos> I wanted him to be different.<eos> And me?<eos> Raised by Aldous Leekie.<eos> Sent off to boarding school.<eos> Topside...<eos> Helsinki?<eos> You weren't supposed to know about Helsinki.<eos> Well, I do.
You're testing me.<eos> - I'm not glitching.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> It's been two months since your last cognitive exam.<eos> Hook me up right now.<eos> Susan gets to restart human cloning with new lab rats to study the genome.<eos> And in return, you get that bot out of your face, and we get to collaborate on a cure.<eos> Aren't you and Scott well on your way to that?<eos> The last viral vector didn't work.<eos> And even if the next one does...
Where is she?<eos> Where's Kendall?<eos> You think I'd kidnap Kendall and then allow myself to be taken hostage?<eos> You'll do anything.<eos> You hunted her down for 20 years.<eos> It wasn't me!<eos> It doesn't make sense, does it?<eos> You don't actually believe her?<eos> She's got the genome, she doesn't need to do this.<eos> But Ira does.
Then we can't just accept this.<eos> We may have been raised without familial bonds, but you, Ira, are my brother. And I'm beginning to believe that means something.<eos> You just stood without your crutches, and your aphasia completely cleared.<eos> Apparently passion helps.<eos> No coffee, but I made chai.<eos> You still feeling it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I haven't had a two-day hangover in a long time.<eos> How are you?<eos> I almost did something desperate.
- When?<eos> In the elevator.<eos> Yes, you told me!<eos> I love it!<eos> I love it?<eos> Hello, this is Doctor Ana?<eos> - Hey!<eos> Hi! - Hi!<eos> - Do you speak English?<eos> - Yes I do.
Yes, of course.<eos> Erm... - Let me.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Yes, the sky-high adrenaline levels, constantly on edge.<eos> It can be very... tense.<eos> And the models, getting them to do what you want,<eos> - when you want, the way you want.<eos> - I try to keep a level head.<eos> Uh-huh. You didn't, though, on December 10th, 2014, did you?
Well, it's really rather simple.<eos> You see, two days ago, Zoe programmed an alarm on her mobile phone -- um, a reminder to call her parents... .. and it got me thinking, you didn't actually need to be there<eos> when the photographs were taken -- not if you programmed your camera to continue taking photographs whilst you made your way into the marquee and murdered Zoe.<eos> You simply set your camera to automatic mode, and with the audience's attention above the catwalk, you slipped beneath it unnoticed.<eos> Without anyone being aware of what you were up to, you made your way under the catwalk.<eos> But one of us would have seen him.<eos> Not if he had his timings right...<eos> It takes two people to get someone into a dress?<eos> Quite intricate.<eos> .. which he did.
Someone who loved her.<eos> Over 500 photographs, one of them conveniently catching the killer in action, giving you the perfect alibi.<eos> I assume that was planned, Jay.<eos> That you wanted us to find it.<eos> It's rather audacious, really.<eos> This... .. is the photograph we enlarged, only to discover that within it was the image of Zoe's actual murder taking place.<eos> The other ten or so images are the ones that were taken around it, and there was something about them that bothered me, something that I couldn't quite get my head round, and then it hit me -- they were all framed identically.<eos> The angle didn't change once.<eos> And you presumed we'd never notice.<eos> But unfortunately for you, we did.
For Rosie to step onto the catwalk -- and once she'd gone, all you needed was for Zoe to return.<eos> As you strangled her, as she fought for her life, arms flailing,<eos> I think she was reaching out, grabbing.<eos> Without your knowledge, the stocking ended up in her clutch.<eos> Caught out by a single stocking.<eos> So close, Jay.<eos> So close.<eos> Mind your head.<eos> Excuse me, do you have a moment?<eos> Of course I do!
Look!<eos> Another one!<eos> Come on.<eos> Wait!<eos> She's not a bobber.<eos> She's alive.<eos> We still gotta do it.<eos> No.<eos> We don't have to do it.<eos> Yes, we do.
God damn it!<eos> We lost the hydraulics!<eos> - Try downshifting!<eos> - I tried that already.<eos> - Can you fix it?<eos> - I'm not a mechanic.<eos> McDonald, let's put our new trainees to work while we wait on the fix.<eos> Everyone, grab a shovel and let's get started.<eos> Uh, shouldn't we finish going through safety training - before we get started?<eos> - You did.
- Fuckin' A.<eos> - How?<eos> Alex, what did you do with the body?<eos> You're sitting on him.<eos> Parts of him.<eos> I mean, he's all over.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Stop.<eos> Look, just because I sit behind a desk all day does not mean your job is harder than mine.<eos> As a matter of fact, it does.
If everything goes well, we'll be done in three dives.<eos> There are 16 people in this operation.<eos> We have Kaitsu, Patte and me.<eos> Our job is to dive the deepest, to the victims.<eos> We'll release them and bring them up to shallower water.<eos> But we cannot do this without safety divers and assistant divers.<eos> They will make sure that we get out safely, and they act as a link between us and the surface.<eos> I am the surface manager.<eos> I handle the operation on the surface.<eos> The others do the diving.
It was totally our own fault.<eos> Now that we know the deal, the next dive should be quick.<eos> Way to go, guys!<eos> - We can call it a day.<eos> You bet.<eos> We felt so great after the successful dive on Monday.<eos> In many ways it went better than we expected.<eos> Even though you try to avoid being lulled into thinking the next dive will be easy, that's kind of what happened.<eos> You should never expect that a dive will go well.<eos> Because then it never does.
Hey. You made a deal?<eos> What kind of deal?<eos> It's a year's license suspension...<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - Five years probation,<eos> - $14 million in resti...<eos> - No jail time?<eos> You think these women want to get dragged through a trial?<eos> I think those women want justice.<eos> I do!
Improper opinion.<eos> Sustained.<eos> What about any other witnesses who...<eos> Asked and answered.<eos> Yes, Ms. Shelby, move on.<eos> Your Honor, someone has to speak for these victims.<eos> You don't speak.<eos> You ask questions.<eos> And if nobody else saw the doctor dosing...<eos> Someone else did.
I lost a $53 pair of sunglasses.<eos> My girlfriend at the time, she was pissed.<eos> She gave them to me.<eos> But out of spite, I went back in there and won my money back.<eos> Five minutes on that blackjack table.<eos> So you from Mexico or Guatemala?<eos> Mexico.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Know how to cook that Mexican food?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I know.<eos> Please, please.<eos> Please don't shoot...<eos> Please, no, no!<eos> Please...<eos> Please...<eos> You don't have to do...<eos> You don't have to do this...<eos> You don't have to... do this...<eos> No, I don't.
Look, it's pretty simple, ok?<eos> If we make it to the base and it's still up and running I might not make it out alive.<eos> Who knows what they wanted me for before you got stuck with me?<eos> Hell if I know.<eos> It's gotta be a cure though, right?<eos> I mean, they had to think that you were gonna help with this mess somehow or they wouldn't have committed so much manpower to keeping you alive.<eos> And I never felt "stuck" with you, for what it's worth.<eos> Axel.<eos> You know what I'm saying.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Maybe some of us have other ideas as to what we wanna do with our lives right now.<eos> - Such as?<eos> - I don't...<eos> I'm just saying!<eos> Look, I'm just trying to keep you people safe, and that includes you, Doc.<eos> So, until we know where we're going or what we're doing, we can at least agree to hunker down someplace for a couple of days, yeah?<eos> Then what do you suggest?<eos> You got a bomb shelter in your back pocket?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe I do.
Let's go!<eos> Go ahead... but not me.<eos> There is something I gotta do. What?<eos> I've left one too many people behind...<eos> I can't do that again...<eos> I'm gonna take another quick look for Gorman...<eos> It's a gong show up there because of that explosion and you got ferals everywhere,<eos> You are gonna have to take point, you ready for that?<eos> Always gotta be last man out, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
If it moves, fling it.<eos> I could never understand it, you know, hotel rooms being smashed up.<eos> That's like hard work.<eos> You'd get a sweat on.<eos> What do you do? Go to bed at 10:00 every night?<eos> I don't think so, you know what I mean?<eos> You only get it once.<eos> You're going to live it to the full.<eos> Have it!<eos> And we did!
If anyone's going to ruin my career, it's going to be me, not you.<eos> The one voted for by the fans means a lot.<eos> Anything that's voted for by fans is special.<eos> Anything that's voted for by idiots, corporate pigs, means nothing to us.<eos> You know, because really the music, fuck all that.<eos> Writing songs is difficult.<eos> Talking shit is easy.<eos> When I do an interview, I'm there to be a fucking gob-shite and to cause as much fucking trouble as possible.<eos> As soon as people realise that the majority of people in this country take drugs, then, I mean, the better off we'll all be.<eos> Everybody does it.
Yeah, so tiresome how law enforcement concerns themselves with intimate activities.<eos> How do you think your clients will feel about their intimate activities... been filmed on hidden cameras?<eos> That must take a bite out of your business.<eos> Makes me think someone made you an offer you couldn't refuse, like, maybe, a certain assassin.<eos> Maybe these theories amuse you, but I have pressing shit to attend to.<eos> Okay, I reconsider cutting this short, since we know you're a paid informant for the FBI.<eos> You told Agent Lange you have no connection to Heavy.<eos> But... she doesn't know that your boy, THX, helped him kill Retro Girl.<eos> - She doesn't know?<eos> - No, she does not.
It's the most un-Dolls thing you've ever said to me.<eos> Pardner, they're looking to settle up the tab.<eos> Tick-tock.<eos> Tick-tock.<eos> What a shit.<eos> Waverly, I can explain.<eos> There is a face that I didn't want to see again.<eos> Jay Novak, my probation officer.<eos> Why would your friend Henry kill him?<eos> - He didn't.
- Everybody went to see Auggie for a shave and to confess their sins.<eos> What was he? - Like, the Father Confessor?<eos> - Well, in a town with no church, you needed one. But Wyatt found out about a cattle rustler who confessed his crimes to ole Father Auggie.<eos> So Wyatt aimed to put Auggie on the witness stand.<eos> Let me take a wild guess.<eos> - Auggie never made it to court?<eos> - Mm-mm. Disappeared the night before the trial.<eos> People say foul play was involved.<eos> Wait. How can August be a revenant, I mean, if Wyatt didn't kill him?<eos> Oh, but he did. Most definitely.
We know where he is, and we know what he wants.<eos> That means we know how to beat him.<eos> How do you propose we do that?<eos> We use me as bait to lure him back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Cisco and Wells can kill him... again.<eos> Who are you pretending to be now?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> Yes, you do, Barry.<eos> You have all the time in the universe...<eos> - literally.<eos> - No, I don't.
Being out there with you guys, fighting meta-humans, saving people...<eos> It's the first time I felt normal in a long time.<eos> Come here.<eos> - This is a group hug moment. - Yeah.<eos> It is.<eos> So all of Zoom's meta-humans are locked up in Iron Heights?<eos> Most of them.<eos> Some are somewhere else.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> No you don't.
I'll miss you too, Cisco.<eos> So I guess I can't text you from another Earth, huh?<eos> I guess not.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> Thank you guys, seriously, for saving our home. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can't stop thinking about my dad's doppelganger.<eos> Seeing him, knowing that he's out there, that should've made it easier.<eos> It doesn't.
Hey, relax!<eos> Everything's fine!<eos> Don't run, you idiots.<eos> He's going to save us, don't run.<eos> Stop, you damn morons! - He's coming!<eos> - My son is a hero!<eos> You hear me?<eos> He's a hero! You really mean that, Dad?<eos> You think I'm a hero?<eos> Of course I do.
If you tell everybody this lie, what'll happen to us?<eos> What'll happen to our family? You'll blow everything up - based off something you think you saw.<eos> - Let me by, Chris.<eos> Whatever you think you saw, it's wrong, Alicia.<eos> I froze.<eos> That's it. That's all that happened, okay?<eos> - Chris, let me go.<eos> - You have to believe me.<eos> You can't say anything.<eos> What if I do?
Get it through your heads.<eos> Both of you. This place is dangerous.<eos> That woman is dangerous.<eos> She's just upset.<eos> I can talk to her.<eos> You stay away from Celia.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Travis is coming over that hill.<eos> When he does, that's when we move.<eos> What if he doesn't?
It's a white label deal, so they have the right to resell these boxes in any form they choose.<eos> Yeah, but Jack, if they have exclusive rights to the algorithm, then we can't use the algorithm to build the platform.<eos> For five years.<eos> They wanted seven, I talked them down.<eos> I know, but you said that we could build the platform once we gave you the box.<eos> Yes, but I never specified a timeframe.<eos> Are you serious? I save your ass and you stab me in the back like this?<eos> - In the front, Richard.<eos> - Laurie, did you know about this?<eos> - I did not.
- Wasted?<eos> - Yeah, the first one we saw, we thought it was a guy who had too many.<eos> You know, he was stumbling.<eos> Till he took out one of our bros.<eos> Never making that mistake again.<eos> Where'd you learn to kill?<eos> Your pops?<eos> It just came to him like it comes to all of us.<eos> Necessity.<eos> How many you done?
What did you do?<eos> They looked up to me for help.<eos> I contained the situation.<eos> I have the hotel to think about.<eos> We were at capacity.<eos> All my guests, it was a sickness.<eos> I couldn't let it spread.<eos> I locked them in...<eos> Hector and I... till help could come.<eos> It never did.
The lesson was to play along, to act as if, not to become one of them.<eos> You don't fit in with these guys.<eos> We all know that.<eos> But what you did, saving James today, that was huge.<eos> You proved your worth.<eos> Shoot, you could come out of this a hero.<eos> I don't want to be a hero to these guys and neither should you.<eos> Look, just be careful how you play this, Dad.<eos> We need them.<eos> No, we don't.
I don't understand, why kill you?<eos> Why not just leave you here?<eos> Back down in the Sea or Cortez we had a friend with us.<eos> Yeah, your friend who got bitten, right?<eos> Yeah, Troy.<eos> You know, he was-- he was sick and we were still figuring shit out.<eos> We didn't know how it worked. We didn't know what was gonna end up happening to him.<eos> We knew there was no way he was not gonna turn.<eos> Troy knew that, so he made us promise not to let that happen to him.<eos> And we didn't.
You can't.<eos> So just hear me out, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> It's about your father.<eos> His accident... it wasn't an accident.<eos> What?<eos> I just- - I thought I was doing the right thing by not telling you. I didn't know.<eos> I just- - I didn't know what--<eos> You told me he fell asleep.<eos> He didn't.
And I'm not interested to find out what that means.<eos> Okay.<eos> Shall we?<eos> To Coleman Blair!<eos> Let's close this fucker.<eos> Good luck, fellas.<eos> Remember, you just sit there and look pretty.<eos> Leave all the talking to me.<eos> And if you mention my Montblanc, then... don't make it overt, like I told you to.<eos> But do.
I want you to break into hell with me and rob the gods blind.<eos> Why would I do anything with you?<eos> Because of what's in that safe.<eos> I have the combination.<eos> May I?<eos> I could simply change you, make you follow me.<eos> But that's not my way.<eos> I want you to see exactly what the gods have in store for you.<eos> Because when you do, you won't have the faintest idea what to do with yourself.<eos> And I do.
You set the rules, I follow them.<eos> But, frankly, I'm not interested in a heavily regulated, closely guarded interview with the leader of the free world.<eos> Nor is that what we want to give you.<eos> I want a conversation with the man.<eos> A meaningful one.<eos> I want to know, is Fitzgerald Grant hell-bent on making a difference in the final days of his presidency, or is he happy just tending the store?<eos> I want to know if the man I voted for thinks he succeeded or failed.<eos> I have no ulterior motive here, aside from wanting to write a damn good article.<eos> Do you want me to write a damn good article?<eos> Of course we do.
So I was looking at some gentlemen's special interest material recently on the Internet, and this ad popped up for a penis-enlargement cream.<eos> I thought, "Well, I'll read on.<eos> I'm not buying a fucking Audi."<eos> Basically it said, "Rub this cream on your penis and it'll get bigger."<eos> I thought, "Well, I'll stop you there.<eos> Rub your penis without the cream, it'll get bigger."<eos> That is the nature of rubbing and penises.<eos> They bloody love it!<eos> Second thing, if this stuff actually worked, wouldn't the guy in the after photos in the advert also have massive hands?<eos> He did not.
There's room in my legs for the boys.<eos> Maybe we could just store old clothes in you.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> And you know what, Flanders?<eos> I think we owe you guys a trip.<eos> Always wanted to visit the postcard museum.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> I wonder if they sell postcards in the gift shop.<eos> We don't.
I... ah-ah-ah... ah...<eos> Aw, for heaven's sakes, Cathy, when we got married, you used to speak for hours.<eos> But since we moved to New York City, nothing! Wow.<eos> It all magically fits.<eos> Come on, Cathy, say something!<eos> Anything!<eos> Fuggedaboutit!<eos> And scene!<eos> I said "fear of public speaking."<eos> Yes, you did.
Humans do that from time to time.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, I am... off to eat.<eos> Oh, you sounded... lovely before.<eos> Oh. Thank you, Walter.<eos> Good night.<eos> Wait, hold on.<eos> Was that a "bending" compliment, or a real compliment?<eos> Why should it matter?<eos> Because it does.
Looks like he won't be a problem after all.<eos> Richard castle investigations.<eos> This is vasily.<eos> I have most important news to discuss.<eos> Uh, listen, if it's about the case...<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You see, I'm a writer, too.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> I have an idea for a nikki heat novel.<eos> -Of course you do.
I'm a zombie, too.<eos> Those 322 people are suspected zombies.<eos> - Kill them?<eos> - I'm a fan of submarine movies.<eos> Cut to the sailor who receives that order closing that hatch on his comrades.<eos> The man that closes that hatch is a hero, isn't he?<eos> If this doesn't work...<eos> If the cure doesn't happen...<eos> - It's going to.<eos> - But if it doesn't...
Which would you prefer, Viv?<eos> Vian.<eos> I only drink liquor that comes out of a barrel.<eos> The way God intended.<eos> Double-fisted it is, then.<eos> So tell me about all the cool stuff your mercenaries will be doing when you pump 'em full of Super Max.<eos> They gonna be dodging bullets Keanu Reeves-style, huh?<eos> You know, the thing about private military contractors is that they love gabbing with strangers about what they do.<eos> So, I've noticed you have a lot of undercover security here tonight.<eos> Do I?
So, I told the 7-7s where he was, and they hit his house, took him out.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> You're saying Dooley's dead?<eos> I didn't do it, but I saw it happen.<eos> What are thinking, man?<eos> We spoke about this!<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> It's not just him, okay?<eos> I went to pick him up, and we took some drugs and some cash that was laying around...<eos> You did wh...?
They just don't send kids from Quitman here anymore.<eos> Don't need to.<eos> They got state-of-the-art everything at that New Quitman.<eos> All I had was a stethoscope and a toilet.<eos> You gonna tell me why you keep digging through admissions from 1988?<eos> How good are these records?<eos> If a name's not on there, they were never here.<eos> Kids never even made it.<eos> Did you say something?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Arnold didn't know how to save you.<eos> He tried, but I stopped him.<eos> Do you want to know why I really gave you the backstory of your son, Bernard?<eos> It was Arnold's key insight, the thing that led the hosts to their awakening... suffering.<eos> The pain that the world is not as you want it to be.<eos> It was when Arnold died, when I suffered, that I... began to understand what he had found.<eos> To realize I was wrong.<eos> But you kept us here in this hell.<eos> Bernard, I told you, Arnold didn't know how to save you.<eos> I do.
Murdered in Texas, buried here, which makes it your play.<eos> Parish PD's a little cranky about it.<eos> Special Agent Suggs, FBI.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> Now here's what we're looking at.<eos> It's a single GSW, through and through.<eos> The size of that skull, I'm thinking adolescent male, maybe 12 to 14 years old.<eos> No, we don't know the gender.<eos> Actually, we do.
Hello?<eos> Hi, Ms. Nagle, it's Janey calling from Dr. Parson's office.<eos> Hi, Janey.<eos> I'm good, thank you.<eos> So, we got the labs back from your 12-week visit, and everything looks great.<eos> Good.<eos> Do you want to know what you're having?<eos> Uh, Dr. P looked at the ultrasound, so I can tell you if it's a boy or a girl.<eos> If you want to know.<eos> Actually, I do.
She was on her school's varsity team since eighth grade.<eos> In between seasons, she liked to play against the boys in the pickup games at Kaiser Park.<eos> When he wasn't dealing drugs or running with his gang, Hector Mendoza liked to play there, too.<eos> A little over a year ago, she embarrassed him on the court.<eos> I mean, just... humiliated.<eos> He went to his car. He came back with his gun, and he pistol whipped her.<eos> He didn't kill her, but he might as well have.<eos> She has irreversible brain damage.<eos> I ran his name yesterday. I didn't see anything about that in the system.<eos> Of course, you didn't.
It was just a temporary fix.<eos> I'm just trying to help.<eos> Trying to one up all of us like usual.<eos> You know what we call her.<eos> Queen Elizabeth.<eos> Queen Elizabeth-- like it's a big secret!<eos> We're not stupid, Maureen.<eos> We're not deaf!<eos> I never called her that.<eos> I didn't!

Some very interesting information indeed.<eos> I can tell by the face you're making, you want me to ask, "What information?"<eos> But I'm not gonna.<eos> 'Cause I don't give a shit.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> I'm going to Houston to meet Dany for the exchange, so we'll keep it a surprise till I get back.<eos> And I know...<eos> "Not doin' jobs anymore, Tulip.<eos> I'm a soul-saving preacher now, and no means no."<eos> - Yes, it does.

Well... with God, it's...<eos> It's never too late to make things right.<eos> I couldn't agree more.<eos> What's this?<eos> That's a deed of transfer for your church and land, as agreed upon.<eos> It's all aboveboard.<eos> Had Miles take a look at it last night.<eos> I'm sorry... you need a pen?<eos> Odin, I didn't agree to this.<eos> Yes, you did... in my office.
Jesus.<eos> Where is god?<eos> I am the resurrection!<eos> I am the way and the truth!<eos> Where is god?<eos> I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know!<eos> None of us do.
Meat!<eos> Nothing has changed.<eos> We are still gonna comb our hair and brush our teeth and do our best at school.<eos> Daddy's still in heaven, like he's always been.<eos> The good part of heaven, not that scary part.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> But we just need to stay strong, be true to ourselves, okay?<eos> We don't need god.<eos> And I'll let you guys in on a little secret, okay?<eos> We never did.
Is there, like, a secret password?<eos> Seriously?<eos> He just keeps the key under the doormat?<eos> It's a million tons of condensed dwarf star.<eos> He said only a select few can pick it up. So...<eos> Welcome to the Fortress of Solitude.<eos> Hey, that's the pod that brought Kal-El...<eos> Clark, to Earth.<eos> Can't believe Clark never invited you here.<eos> He did.
What happens on a retreat is private.<eos> It's between the Ascender and The Light.<eos> Why are Bill and Felicia here?<eos> Why do you think Bill and Felicia are there?<eos> Because they think I'm fucking up with running things, this whole... This whole thing with Miranda Frank.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> Everything you need to know, you know.<eos> You're 10R, after all.<eos> Well, I don't know what Eddie's hiding.<eos> Huh. Don't you?
It's genetic engineering facility that treats aliens like lab rats.<eos> Amputated.<eos> Skinned.<eos> Drained.<eos> Injected with experimental drugs.<eos> Why would they do that?<eos> Weaponizing alien abilities for military purposes.<eos> What do they do to humans?<eos> Does Clark know where it is?<eos> No. No one does.
You think this is funny?<eos> Everything I have feared has come to pass.<eos> I couldn't be more serious.<eos> We have to stop them.<eos> They're using your satellites.<eos> Can't you reprogram them and destroy Myriad from the inside?<eos> I tried. There's some pretty epic force fields around those satellites at the moment.<eos> You're always 10 steps ahead, Max.<eos> I know you have a plan.<eos> Of course I do.
Are you all right?<eos> Well... And who's this?<eos> Oh, uh, yes, that's a little harder to explain.<eos> - I don't understand, sweetie.<eos> - I... Dr. Danvers, you might want to step back.<eos> - What the hell?<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No, whatever that is, that killed your father!<eos> - No, he didn't.
Afraid I'll win?<eos> You've already lost.<eos> Accept it and the glorious fulfillment of Astra's vision.<eos> In the end, she defeated you.<eos> This doesn't look like victory to me.<eos> And all you're doing is betraying her.<eos> I was with Astra in her final moments.<eos> We forgave each other, we paid respect to our blood bonds.<eos> - She didn't want this.<eos> - Of course she did.
This TV station is old.<eos> Not that old.<eos> Not old-old.<eos> But old enough that it uses broadcast technology instead of digital.<eos> We can transmit a signal by calibrating it to Myriad's frequency, without leaving any online fingerprints.<eos> Take that, Indigo.<eos> It'll ride the wave without anybody knowing a thing.<eos> - I have one question for you, Max.<eos> - Shoot. The earrings, how did you know I would wear them?<eos> I didn't.
It's not my personal division.<eos> It's the Bureau's International Response Team.<eos> I'm the unit chief.<eos> And this is S.S.A. Clara Seger.<eos> Lieutenant Doshi, your reputation precedes you.<eos> I'm afraid that's my cross to bear.<eos> The candles?<eos> I'm sure you waited...<eos> Until the scene was processed.<eos> Yes, I did.
He just wanted that noise to stop.<eos> He said, "Get it out of my head."<eos> Did you notice anything else, a drop in temperature?<eos> No.<eos> But the power went out.<eos> And when I looked through the broken window,<eos> I saw something.<eos> What did you see, exactly?<eos> You're not gonna believe me.<eos> They certainly didn't.
-No.<eos> Not bad per se.<eos> A compliment. Not grudging.<eos> You were right when you said that I don't really even understand--<eos> -Naman, don't you have a girlfriend? -Yes.<eos> No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Either way, you're unfaithful.<eos> No doubt you have some twisted Brahman justification to explain it away.<eos> He does.
But he died from asphyxiation.<eos> They found neurotoxic venom in his system, which caused paralysis, inhibiting his diaphragm from contracting.<eos> How did that happen?<eos> M.E. has no clue.<eos> But the report suggests the skin of the victim's face was removed while he was still alive.<eos> You remember the case we handled with the alien sightings?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The missing cow ovary mystery.<eos> Never figured that one out.<eos> Well, actually, we did.
Ready?<eos> Come on.<eos> Stay low.<eos> How the hell did they find us again?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> They lost us when we went in that cave, right?<eos> And they found you two when you went outside with the rubies.<eos> We never even had a chance, then.<eos> We don't.<eos> But you do.
You know, we could never serve this where I work.<eos> It's over roasted and totally acidic.<eos> Jodi, it's an AA meeting.<eos> The only thing this coffee needs to be is not vodka.<eos> You do know you two aren't fooling anyone, right?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Mom, everyone knows you and Steve are dating.<eos> - No, they don't.
What are you talking about?<eos> That is so not true.<eos> Look, I know we agreed to keep it discreet, but at a certain point, I got to wonder are-are we boyfriend and girlfriend or just quickies and takeout?<eos> Well, you say quickies and takeout like it's a bad thing.<eos> I'm not asking you to marry me, I'm just asking for us to go out to dinner sometime.<eos> Maybe... see a movie?<eos> Take a romantic walk in the park.<eos> Why do I always have to be the guy?<eos> Hey, just because I have feelings doesn't mean I'm not a man.<eos> Eh, it kind of does.
No, they give you four for a reason.<eos> Well, um... we're here, so...<eos> Uh, thank you for a lovely evening.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I... really had a good time.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> When can I see you again?<eos> Well, uh, that's a little tricky.<eos> You get how this situation is complicated.<eos> I do.
Aye.<eos> She can have the Blue Room.<eos> I meant... for the two of you.<eos> You must've...<eos> discussed it between you.<eos> I'll make up two rooms, then.<eos> The fever is infectious.<eos> Reckon she caught it from the Partridge lad.<eos> She needs a doctor.<eos> They both do.
This whole town is to pack up and move on?<eos> There's the family house.<eos> If I borrow money against that, we can pay the men.<eos> It might give Jericho a chance at least.<eos> Well, then do it.<eos> It's what my father would have expected.<eos> It seems you can't fight who you really are.<eos> When you told me you were a Blackwood, I knew this day would come.<eos> This doesn't have to change things.<eos> With the best will in the world, Johnny, it does.
I've nothing new to tell you.<eos> We didn't have a body back then and with the blanket there's a direct link to someone in your house.<eos> Anybody could've taken it, including you.<eos> Happy to let yourself into my home without permission.<eos> How do I know you've not done it before?<eos> You're not the only one who lives under this roof.<eos> Skinny, paying bed and board.<eos> And Johnny Blackwood.<eos> He and Red never saw eye to eye.<eos> A lot of folk didn't.
- They're awfully gassy.<eos> Yes.<eos> I suppose one can always open the windows.<eos> - Don't you miss it?<eos> - What?<eos> The country of your birth.<eos> The people here.<eos> Your own flesh and blood.<eos> Well, I would've done if they'd accepted the woman I love.<eos> But they didn't, so I don't.
- Clarence House...<eos> - Our home.<eos> What about it?<eos> We have to give it up.<eos> The home of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom is Buckingham Palace.<eos> Says who?<eos> Me.<eos> I thought you hated that place.<eos> I do.<eos> We all do.
Yes, I'd like his scope recorded for the first quarter mile tomorrow morning.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> And then we might have to think about pairing him with another rider.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Yes?<eos> - How could you?<eos> - Margaret.<eos> You gave me your word.<eos> Promised me he'd still be there when I got back.<eos> - I did.
No, you're... my best friend.<eos> You wanna get something to eat?<eos> Uh, remember the boy in the red baseball hat?<eos> The one I saw in Captain Mulaney's memory?<eos> He must be connected to both cases.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - You don't like it?<eos> Arrest me for breaking and entering.<eos> You don't get to select our cases.<eos> Then who does?
- And?<eos> - Her name is Nina.<eos> - And?<eos> - That is all I know.<eos> Except for the fact he was on the phone with her until 3:00 a.m. last night talking about Doctor Who.<eos> David Tennant this, Tardis that, all night long.<eos> I love my Time Lords as much as the next guy, but I need eight hours of man sleep.<eos> Sounds like an episode of Nerd Love.<eos> Wait, does Kirsten know about Nina?<eos> She does now.
What? What's the emergency?<eos> Veronica Mars here wants to stitch into Sandy.<eos> Maggie gave the go-ahead?<eos> Okay, then we're going behind Maggie's back.<eos> Intriguing, tell me more.<eos> I can't stop thinking about that note.<eos> What if it was meant for me?<eos> Look, I know you're focusing on finding your father, but honestly, it sounds like a stretch, Stretch.<eos> Not all roads lead to Daniel Stinger.<eos> Yeah, but what if this one does? What if...
Get up.<eos> Nice.<eos> Well, I played hockey in high school.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Tell us about Sandy.<eos> There's nothing to tell.<eos> All right? We went out once and she blew me off.<eos> I just wanted a second chance.<eos> She didn't have to call the cops.<eos> She didn't.
Trust me, it helps.<eos> That's not just tea.<eos> Some situations require more than just tea.<eos> Like when you shoot your first person?<eos> You didn't have a choice.<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> At least you didn't kill her.<eos> She's lucky you aren't a better shot.<eos> How did she know about the Stitchers program?<eos> She didn't.
Where were you Friday night?<eos> One of my kids was sick.<eos> I spent the night in the emergency room.<eos> And I got no idea how I'm gonna pay for it.<eos> Guess what I've got.<eos> Mr. Bray.<eos> I take it from your self-congratulatory expression, you have found the missing bones.<eos> I did.<eos> We-we did.<eos> Hodgins did.
Well, I never saw her use drugs.<eos> That wasn't my question.<eos> Look, are you willing to swear that you didn't know?<eos> 'Cause we got her e-mails.<eos> She said it was only once in a while.<eos> So, you let a known drug user work in your office defending clients.<eos> It wasn't right, but I understood.<eos> If she lost a case, a family got broken up or a child's hopes for the future destroyed.<eos> She needed an outlet.<eos> We all do.
You remember Meisner?<eos> I've seen him.<eos> I know he's here.<eos> Wait, you've seen him, and he hasn't told you?<eos> Told me what?<eos> He was in the helicopter that night.<eos> He killed the King and got Diana.<eos> Meisner has Diana?<eos> I said he got her, not that he has her.<eos> Then who does?
What are we doing out here?<eos> Jones needs more data.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You really think that more data's gonna stop that?<eos> Your silence is deafening.<eos> No one's forcing you to stay, Deacon.<eos> You could always join the rest of your men.<eos> How many was it went AWOL this week?<eos> I'd ask what's keeping you here, but we both know, don't we?<eos> Does she?
This the sacrifice you were talking about?<eos> Hmm. - You knew this was gonna happen?<eos> - Ticky-tock, those eyes.<eos> Left, right, swaying like a granddaddy clock.<eos> Can't take 'em off me.<eos> God damn it, Jennifer.<eos> Today is September 23, 2044.<eos> The day I die.<eos> This didn't have to happen.<eos> It already did.
Previously on Stitchers... - What's your name?<eos> - Kirsten.<eos> - I'm Cameron.<eos> - Cameron met a girl.<eos> Her name is Nina.<eos> - Wait, does Kirsten know about Nina?<eos> - She does now.
Calista, please don't take the law into your own hands.<eos> Don't tell me what to do!<eos> Okay.<eos> But you came to me, remember?<eos> What do you want to be?<eos> The kind of hero you spoke about at the gala?<eos> Somebody like Janice, or a Power full of hate and vengeance?<eos> Both.<eos> You know you need me.<eos> We don't.
Well, today I went out to see a witness on this thing, and, uh, had to take an Uber over here because somebody dumped fish guts all over my car.<eos> Jesus. Why?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> So nobody around your shop's mentioned my case?<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> - Not even the Crypt Keeper, huh?<eos> Come on.<eos> The shit on my car smells like a fucking fish farm, okay?<eos> I just want to know if Cooperman had anything to do with it. Did he?<eos> Of course he didn't.
That's where the best man is.<eos> The only man.<eos> They're better equipped to deal with gall bladder problems in America. Due to the high fat diets they have here.<eos> Leaving me without you for the summit with Ike.<eos> - Can't you delay it?<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> Besides, you have already stated your ability to run the ship without me for some time.<eos> In jest, my dear boy, when you become mutinous and presumptuous.<eos> You know how much I depend on you.<eos> - I do.
The School Certificate, then.<eos> Any privately-tutored equivalents thereof, perhaps?<eos> I see.<eos> Her Majesty the Queen, Ma'am.<eos> This is a surprise.<eos> To what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> I came because I wanted to ask you a question about my education.<eos> What about it?<eos> - The fact that I didn't receive one.<eos> - You did.
Goodness.<eos> That's the second consecutive private audience that he's missed.<eos> - It's most unlike him.<eos> - Yes, isn't it?<eos> Are you all right, Martin?<eos> Your Majesty, I've had the opportunity to think about your very kind offer to become your Private Secretary.<eos> And I'm afraid I must decline.<eos> Why?<eos> In this instance, I really do believe you'll be better served by Michael.<eos> No, you don't.
- I think you know precisely.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> But I can't just summon the brightest, most formidable men in the country and give them a dressing down, like children.<eos> Why?<eos> You are in the right, they in the wrong.<eos> Yes, but they're far more intelligent than I am.<eos> Any confrontation, they'd out-debate me, out-think me and out-maneuver me.<eos> But this isn't about education or intelligence. This is about integrity and principle.<eos> Ma'am, you say you don't have what it takes to do battle with these people.<eos> You do.
He always plays up.<eos> That's who he is.<eos> You don't seem the slightest bit worried.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Well, can I just say one more time, for the record...<eos> I think we should start fast, and run at a good clip.<eos> - Noted.<eos> - I am right sometimes, you know.<eos> Even you said yourself that I have good instincts.<eos> You do.
You were smitten, blushing like a little girl.<eos> - Well, he is rather a wow.<eos> - A "wow"?<eos> Tall and handsome, saturnine.<eos> A bit of a Heathcliff.<eos> He wants total control.<eos> Well, any artist worth anything would insist on that.<eos> - You don't really want a flatterer.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> No, you don't.
It's the water, the play of light.<eos> The trickery.<eos> The fish, down below.<eos> I think all our work is unintentionally revealing and I find it especially so with your pond.<eos> Beneath the tranquility and the elegance and the light playing on the surface, I saw honesty and pain, terrible pain.<eos> The framing itself, indicated to me that you wanted us to see something beneath all the muted colors, deep down in the water.<eos> Terrible despair.<eos> Hiding like a Leviathan. Like a sea monster.<eos> - You saw all that?<eos> - Yes, I did.
So he can call straight in.<eos> I know only because I tried to get one for Mike and was refused.<eos> Yes.<eos> On account of him not being a family member.<eos> - Porchey is like family. - Is he?<eos> Yes.<eos> Part of the furniture.<eos> Well, as long as you don't sit on him anytime soon.<eos> - Well, that all seemed to go well.<eos> - Yes, it did, didn't it?
Okay.<eos> See you later.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> What does EST say about death?<eos> I don't, um-- I don't know.<eos> It never came up.<eos> Gabriel said that our people were with my mother when she died, that she wanted me to know that she loved me.<eos> Paige knows we love her, right?<eos> Of course she does.
No, but she's still on the island.<eos> Kirk's preparing her exit plan.<eos> I don't know what the preparations are, but I know who can find out-- Manuel Esteban.<eos> The Chilean Spymaster?<eos> - Who's Esteban?<eos> - Our next Blacklister.<eos> Manuel Orentez Esteban.<eos> Leader of Pinochet's Caravan of Death that institutionalized a state-sponsored system of terror through abuse, abduction, and murder.<eos> According to our database, he died in 1989.<eos> Except he didn't.
Leader of Pinochet's Caravan of Death that institutionalized a state-sponsored system of terror through abuse, abduction, and murder.<eos> According to our database, he died in 1989.<eos> Except he didn't.<eos> Esteban is alive and well and a legendary enforcer for a series of authoritarian regimes.<eos> Assuming what you say is true and Esteban is alive, what makes you think he can help locate Keen?<eos> Kirk's man in Cuba is protected by the military.<eos> If the military is involved, Esteban will know about it.<eos> We'll never find Esteban in time.<eos> We have no assets in Cuba.<eos> Of course you do, Harold.
I'm not leaving without her.<eos> You think I'm gonna let you tag along so you can inform the people who kidnapped Elizabeth they have the right to remain silent?<eos> I appreciate your assistance, but I'm not interested in having an ethical debate with you about whether they have the right to consult with an attorney before I put a bullet in their head.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What about that dirtball?<eos> I suppose you think, uh, I should be okay with letting him walk.<eos> It's entirely up to you.<eos> You made a deal with him.<eos> Yes, in order to save Elizabeth, I made a deal with the devil of the day.<eos> I did.
Okay, you're really putting on mixed signals here.<eos> Please stop talking.<eos> Okay. Of course you're insecure about your body.<eos> You're a teenager.<eos> It's part of the job description.<eos> But if this whole skinny-dipping thing ever even happens, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> -Easy for you to --<eos> -You're still talking.<eos> You have nothing to worry about because nobody's going to be looking at you, because all those other kids are gonna be too preoccupied with their own insecurities.<eos> But i-if they do?
Who's Oliver?<eos> My brother.<eos> I thought you were an only child.<eos> I am.<eos> "Oh"?<eos> [ Both laugh ] It's Sunday-night dinner.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Um, this is a surprise.<eos> You keep saying that you don't want to eat at the house.<eos> Well, tonight, I do.
I hate to interrupt your moment of Zen, but it's time you fill me in on the details of the buy.<eos> Keehi Small Boat Harbor, tomorrow morning.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now I know the where and when.<eos> Who's the buyer?<eos> Guy I hooked up with while I was on the inside.<eos> Nobody you would know.<eos> That's reassuring.<eos> Look, I would tell you that you can trust the dude, but really, I shouldn't have to, because you should trust me.<eos> I do, Levi.
Copy that.<eos> What have you got?<eos> Found a fresh print on that old pistol you guys recovered.<eos> Pretty good chance it belongs to whomever shot the kid.<eos> Ran it through AFIS, came up snake eyes.<eos> But I did find a different set of prints on the bullets inside the magazine.<eos> Pretty sure these babies were left there over 75 years ago.<eos> I was able to lift them during a process called cyanoacrylate fuming, ironically a technique invented by the Japanese.<eos> Eric... did you get a hit?<eos> Indeed I did.
That's what Pilcher says, right?<eos> Dr. Yedlin.<eos> That was... very impressive, what you did in there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I mean... segmental recession of saphenous vein interposition graft?<eos> That's right.<eos> I was... just wondering, sir, if it might be possible for you to teach me that.<eos> I don't work here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You... You don't?
It's just... maybe he would have more success without the upset of your visits.<eos> That's absurd.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, he gets upset, but at his situation here.<eos> He just expresses it to me.<eos> We think it's more than that.<eos> We?<eos> Wait, who's we?<eos> His... his doctors feel this way?<eos> His entire treatment team does.
Don't bring us any more darkness.<eos> And if you don't do The Walk, I will tell Sarah everything... about Miranda, about Alison.<eos> I'll tell her you don't believe.<eos> Dr. Gottlieb is wonderful.<eos> A brilliant dentist and the kindest man you'll ever meet.<eos> And this is where you would sit.<eos> - Looks like home.<eos> - Doesn't it?<eos> So do you have any experience in the dental field?<eos> Oh, no. I don't.
You need to appreciate what that woman's do...<eos> They canceled school.<eos> So we're gonna...<eos> Hang out, I guess.<eos> Hang out, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> He got the message.<eos> Damn right he did.
How else would you know about Mina's situation?<eos> I've been to lots of places.<eos> Have you enjoyed them? 'Cause your time of coming and going is now squarely in the past.<eos> You think I killed that FBI agent, but... you don't have a murder weapon, just some blood in a car.<eos> I've already come up with six different ways to explain it.<eos> Tell me one.<eos> I hope you come to my trial.<eos> Should be fun.<eos> Think you can lie your way out?<eos> I do.
The maid or Kensi?<eos> Both.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> I got it.<eos> Oh, I see you're playing cards.<eos> We're not gonna talk about that.<eos> Listen, so I was thinking maybe, uh, Jack should stay with us tonight.<eos> That is a good idea.<eos> I mean, 'cause our couch doesn't have bullet holes in it.<eos> It does not.
Fuck you.<eos> He's always in.<eos> Put him on, Nicole.<eos> He's not in.<eos> Therefore, I must by law allow this lawsuit to proceed.<eos> Mr. McBride has filed for a number of discovery requests and moved for an expedited discovery schedule.<eos> Well, obviously, we'll need a few months to comply with those requests.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> A client like Borns Tech has most files online already.<eos> We don't, actually.
Do any of your talking points address why you had someone else take your SATs for you?<eos> Okay, first of all, the SATs are culturally biased.<eos> It's a fact.<eos> And B, are multiple-choice tests even within your jurisdiction?<eos> No, but murder is.<eos> We know Bailey threatened to expose your academic fraud.<eos> That gives you motive.<eos> Oh, you think I killed her?<eos> Oh. Yeah, no.<eos> No, I did not.
Steve was one of my Cls.<eos> He helped me make a lot of Utopium busts.<eos> So many, that I wondered if he was playing me, actually working for the guys behind Lucky U.<eos> And I came over here to confront him.<eos> And it turns out, I'm not so bad at my job, I was right.<eos> But unbeknownst to me, Bailey was trying to set him up.<eos> She didn't know he was a CI.<eos> He found the wire on her and he used it to strangle her.<eos> - He admitted all of this?<eos> - Yeah, he did.
You can have all you need.<eos> Great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Just sign up for the brain plan.<eos> 25 grand a month.<eos> We now take Bitcoin.<eos> I can bring you a brain in return in a couple days.<eos> It's not brain friends, Liv, it's brain business.<eos> You did hear the part about the apocalypse, didn't you?<eos> Sure did.
You're not a bouncer.<eos> God, you breathing.<eos> It's like...<eos> You want me to stop breathing?<eos> It's very distracting.<eos> I mean, look, Ned, you just don't need to get so wound up, okay? - I mean...<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I get it.<eos> I really do.
I don't need a billion dollars.<eos> What's going on with these two?<eos> They're just having a thing.<eos> Sorry I asked. Anyway, before he was an angel investor,<eos> Overson was in the navy.<eos> He was assigned to the National Security Agency, where he was instrumental in developing part of their mass data collection program.<eos> Now, that I didn't read in the book.<eos> It was highly classified, and for that reason, SECNAV has tasked us to investigate his murder.<eos> We got a crime scene?<eos> We do.
Yeah, no, I get it.<eos> It's-it's really clever.<eos> Um, just seems like a pretty narrow market.<eos> 30% of Los Angeles households have pets.<eos> That's, like, a million people.<eos> I bet you have a pet. A dog.<eos> Monty.<eos> Does Monty have a butler?<eos> No.<eos> No, he does not.
You should be very proud of yourself.<eos> Thank you, Avery.<eos> Eight million. Oh, my God.<eos> You can tell me.<eos> I won't tell anybody.<eos> Come on, you know where it is.<eos> Let's go get it right now.<eos> - I didn't steal it.<eos> But I'm gonna find out who did.<eos> And when I do...
On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?<eos> Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behavior.<eos> I hope that you can accept my apology.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> And, Emily, I'm sorry for saying dermatologists aren't real doctors.<eos> And I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.<eos> Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?<eos> Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady faces...<eos> Okay, the point is that we accept your apology.<eos> Uh, maybe you do.
We should be pretty close to those coordinates.<eos> Everybody keep your eyes peeled.<eos> For what, asbestos?<eos> 'Cause that's all I can see.<eos> Ooh...! Easy.<eos> It's original brickwork.<eos> This museum's built on the bones of an 18th-century church.<eos> This is original subfloor. - A smuggling vault.<eos> - The church smuggled?<eos> - Ooh. - Everybody did.
I'm back, Pop.<eos> Good. Think like a profiler.<eos> Your team will find this farmhouse.<eos> That's inevitable.<eos> But what will they find when they walk in the door?<eos> FBI!<eos> Morgan?<eos> Spence.<eos> Anyone want to say anything?<eos> I do.
Good. Think like a profiler.<eos> Your team will find this farmhouse.<eos> That's inevitable.<eos> But what will they find when they walk in the door?<eos> FBI!<eos> Morgan?<eos> Spence.<eos> Anyone want to say anything?<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
Dad...<eos> What is it, Morgan?<eos> What is it?<eos> I'm scared, Pop.<eos> I can't feel anything.<eos> Pop, I'm scared.<eos> Dying is easy.<eos> Not being there for your son.<eos> I want to.<eos> I do.
Probably on his way to find Eva.<eos> Who's probably gonna try to kill him.<eos> I've already put a BOLO out.<eos> Patton's monitoring his cell phone and credit cards. We're hitting the streets.<eos> He won't get far, King.<eos> Yeah, that's all well and good, but there's still one thing we need to do.<eos> Somebody's got to tell Abby.<eos> He did what?<eos> ! How could you let this happen? !<eos> I... I-I didn't.
All right. You're going to be out of here before you know it, aren't you?<eos> Man, I'm trying to.<eos> So all I need is seven more credits, and then I'm done.<eos> That makes me feel so happy.<eos> I am too, Michael.<eos> I'm very excited for you.<eos> Cool, thank you.<eos> I'm kind of sad.<eos> You don't want to see me graduate?<eos> You do but you don't?
Just gonna go with it.<eos> Everyone thinks I suck at everything I do, because I never commit to it.<eos> I hate to sound like a punk-ass teenager, but I just don't care anymore.<eos> I don't want to live my life by a plan.<eos> I don't want to live in between lines that tell you have to do these certain things.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> I'm tired of everyone telling me I need to do something.<eos> Nobody's ever even told you you need to do this, this, and this.<eos> Yes they do!<eos> Everyone does!
There they come.<eos> How could someone who was in my life for six years suddenly be gone?<eos> It's impossible to understand.<eos> But he was here.<eos> He did exist.<eos> And he has a legacy that I have to fulfill for him.<eos> And that I will fulfill for him.<eos> Gun violence, for me, was always just something that I saw in the news.<eos> And I certainly never thought it would impact me or my community.<eos> And then it did.
I don't remember. I...<eos> I think that...<eos> I mean, there was a period of time that I mean, I lied to her.<eos> I mean, I lied to her too.<eos> I didn't like, fess up to her and then lie to the world. The primary person, I was trying to protect finding out about this was Huma.<eos> And so, I think I was hacked. I think, you know, whatever it is, I don't...<eos> I don't I mean, the same stories I was telling, I was...<eos> It started out as my... my telling her.<eos> Did Huma want you to get back into politics?<eos> Well, she did.

"He's fought for my community "for a very long time and<eos> "you know, if Huma can forgive Anthony then why can't a voter forgive Anthony?"<eos> My mom at first was actually really opposed to it.<eos> She said, "Oh, no, you can't work for him."<eos> "You can't work for him. That's awful.<eos> It's awful what he did."<eos> I tried making the reference to like Bill Clinton.<eos> And then she said, "No, Bill's different."<eos> I believe in Anthony and..<eos> Some people don't, but a lot of people do.
I think you do, grandpa.<eos> Let's do this again. Let's do this again.<eos> Before you go can you assure us that you're gonna stay in the race? That even if the going gets really, really tough which it will be nationally, possibly internationally.<eos> I don't want to support someone who's going to later drop out.<eos> I'm not gonna stop doing it because I wanna make sure that my son grows up in this great city and be able to stand on a street corner and yell at his future mayor.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> If you mean that.<eos> That's a good man, a good politician. - Thank you.<eos> - I support Anthony Weiner.<eos> - Yes, we do. - Yes, we do.
Employee ID number 32823?<eos> Handled security over there, and then he came back to the States<eos> - to work for you here?<eos> - I don't have any idea.<eos> Who would know for sure?<eos> Main counsel for personnel matters.<eos> Donald Cooperman.<eos> Once again, Donald Cooperman.<eos> Mr. McBride, do you have any more questions for this witness?<eos> Oh, no, Your Honor, I don't.
And while he may elicit your feelings of compassion... feelings are not facts.<eos> Judge: Mr. McBride?<eos> Rebuttal?<eos> Callie Senate is an excellent attorney.<eos> I've known her a long time.<eos> And she's just doing her job.<eos> And I'm doing mine.<eos> Does she want to win?<eos> Of course.<eos> Do I?
- No.<eos> - Was I talking to you?<eos> This verdict is off the charts.<eos> It'll be set aside by the court of appeals.<eos> We'll take our chances, okay?<eos> Between appeals and motions of remittitur and the present-day value, by the time you get it--<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, are you under the impression that you won?<eos> Because you did not at all.
It's all we have right now.<eos> Okay. Let's do this.<eos> So much for surprising him.<eos> Oh, we'll think of something else.<eos> We always do.<eos> What if...?<eos> What if I could burn our names off the gravestones that Hades made for us, the ones holding us here?<eos> I looked for a spell like that.<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> Actually, it does.
This is pointless, Belle.<eos> Where is Rumplestiltskin?<eos> Look, Gaston, please stop this.<eos> I can't!<eos> Seeing him dead is the only thing I care about anymore.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> You broke into my locker?<eos> Gaston, I want to help you move on.<eos> If you still have this book, it must mean something to you.<eos> Of course it does.
Some dad, huh?<eos> Calista, we need your help.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> You're gonna walk in calmly and talk to him.<eos> No.<eos> Calista and I will go in together.<eos> I will use my energy cubes to separate him from the hostages.<eos> It'll be a bloodbath.<eos> He wants to talk to you, alone.<eos> 'Course he does.
Then that's where the fighting starts.<eos> We'll dig in there.<eos> O.<eos> Be careful.<eos> We're all set.<eos> Ok. You're ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, try doing that hanging upside down.<eos> This will work.<eos> And if it doesn't?
Might be where this came from.<eos> Give me a sec.<eos> - Thanks, Doc.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> Did the doctor say I can shower yet?<eos> I can't imagine how hard this is... but we need you to hold on just a little bit longer.<eos> Carolyn, I just want to make sure you know that none of this is your fault, okay?<eos> You guys have a brave little girl here.<eos> Yes, we do.
Whoa, hold on.<eos> Obviously, there's been a mistake made.<eos> Hey, whoa, wait a minute. I'm telling you--let go... wait!<eos> Sir.<eos> I threw a punch.<eos> I know, it was stupid.<eos> I just got off a 14 hour flight.<eos> I'm tired, I'm cranky.<eos> You know how I get when I get cranky.<eos> Yeah, I do, yeah, hmm.
I think we're good, but things like this make me wonder if Emily's really the right person for me.<eos> I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other? No.<eos> Never.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> What?<eos> Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.<eos> Fine.<eos> I had reservations about you, too.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> No, I didn't.
Hello.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Meemaw, look,<eos> I'm sorry, but...<eos> I have to defend my girlfriend to you.<eos> Oh, Sheldon, thank you.<eos> Oh, great, now you're gonna get emotional.<eos> I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop.<eos> I-I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person.<eos> I did.
MEDINA:<eos> KNOX, NEED TO DEBRIEF ON LOBOS.<eos> Duty calls.<eos> Enjoy the bagels. Later.<eos> TO: DRE. TAKE TARIQ TO SHOOT HOOPS.<eos> KEEP HIM AWAY FROM TRUTH.<eos> They require so much.<eos> I was arranging a... a pickup for my son after school.<eos> Do you have kids?<eos> No, I don't.
The mother's in no condition to answer any questions.<eos> You all right?<eos> Not really.<eos> Is that how you came out?<eos> I don't know.<eos> My parents didn't have baby pictures.<eos> I can't believe it came from McCarthy.<eos> He's a fu... monster.<eos> Briggs knows the controls?<eos> No, he doesn't.
You can't trust her.<eos> And whatever they look like on the surface... they're monsters underneath.<eos> You're ruthless.<eos> World domination cometh.<eos> You get the killer instinct from your parents?<eos> My parents are dead, aren't they?<eos> Truth is, we don't know much about anything about... your parents, about you, about any of it.<eos> So you don't know shit.<eos> Not about me.<eos> No one does.
1939.<eos> This is a first edition.<eos> Fiona, I can't take this. This is too generous.<eos> I wasn't clear, I'm sorry.<eos> I'd like you to take it to Sherlock.<eos> It's his. He loaned it to me.<eos> He did?<eos> The day the police arrested Phil.<eos> He knew I liked cats, so he thought I might like poems about them, too.<eos> I didn't.
You are now left to manage your business, alone.<eos> What of it?<eos> I have recently lost some of my capital and am pondering the wisdom of having all my eggs in one basket, as I'm sure you will understand.<eos> So, I have been thinking, perhaps I could be persuaded to invest in a new business.<eos> And if it was something already established, all the better.<eos> You're proposing a partnership?<eos> Scrooge and Fagin.<eos> It has a certain warmth to it, does it not, my dear?<eos> May I speak plainly?<eos> Please do.
No, we will not have it said that it was written under duress, that you were coerced, that this was somehow false.<eos> She will read it and see the truth of it in your eyes.<eos> This is not a matter for negotiation.<eos> - Is the carriage here?<eos> - Yes, miss.<eos> SHE SIGHS I feel sick.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> ..Martha, a glass of water?<eos> I don't want to be late.<eos> Or do I?
There's a $30 admission fee to Dacey's Lounge. Go.<eos> Get down there.<eos> Me, too, Gibbs?<eos> Keep digging on our gangbanger.<eos> Yeah, Duck.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm on my way down.<eos> It was nothing, Doctor.<eos> You would have found it eventually.<eos> But I didn't, Mr. Palmer.
Let me rephrase that.<eos> The case was affecting my vision.<eos> As an analyst, I should have seen things more clearly.<eos> Now there were two women missing, and the trail was still cold.<eos> Like everything else.<eos> Dan the creepy '90s owner man was right.<eos> We checked those backdoor cameras, and the wires had clearly been snipped.<eos> Likely for a reason.<eos> You check the back alley?<eos> We did.
You would have my back, obviously.<eos> Right?<eos> Who?<eos> Me or Jay?<eos> Because I think I want to watch that fight.<eos> It's just surreal, you know?<eos> The two of them, they were cell mates.<eos> Now he's just on the payroll.<eos> I'm sure Voight has his reasons.<eos> Yeah. He usually does.
What no? Your mouth looks full of that crap.<eos> You swallowed it or what?<eos> Don't eat crap like that.<eos> No, no.<eos> You chew it too?<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> Go spit it out!<eos> For real?<eos> - I swear I don't.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Watch TV if you like.<eos> The remote's right there.<eos> I'll make some tea.<eos> Archie. When did they arrive?<eos> - A little while ago.<eos> Look at what mom sent me.<eos> Wool cap for the baby, sweets!<eos> Everything's going to be fine now.<eos> Go, serve them tea.<eos> - What? No way! You do it.
So, you come all this way to carry out this attack, and then stop to save a bunch of innocent people's lives?<eos> What the hell were you doing, tangling with Aman Bashir?<eos> - You blew six months...! - Whoa!<eos> Whoa, whoa!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> of CIA surveillance!<eos> Wait a minute, wait a minute!<eos> If you told us why you were here, we would have handled it differently.<eos> I don't owe you any explanations...<eos> The hell you don't.
Whatever you're involved in, it's not too late.<eos> We can stop it.<eos> We're gonna stay here.<eos> As long as it takes.<eos> The scar is not from Bashir.<eos> I got it when I escaped from my kidnappers.<eos> You escaped?<eos> Yes.<eos> The night that they thought you died.<eos> I almost did.
I'll know more in a few hours.<eos> Yeah, well, we've got exactly two of those before Nolan's supposed to meet with Bashir.<eos> Yeah, if we let him go, he's gonna help attack New Orleans.<eos> Or help us save it.<eos> Thanks a lot, Charlie, much appreciated.<eos> NOPD canvassed the street Calloway was killed on.<eos> An old woman said she saw a white utility truck with some ad on the side.<eos> Sounds like the same truck I saw Bashir escape in.<eos> She get plates?<eos> She did not.
Say the word.<eos> I'm not making any more decisions concerning LokSat without Beckett.<eos> Now that is the smartest thing I've heard all day! Ohh.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Okay, I'll get you more aspirin.<eos> You are not quitting.<eos> I'm unfit to be a cop, Captain.<eos> If you hadn't talked me down back there...<eos> I had every intention of pulling that trigger.<eos> But you didn't.
That's a postal felony.<eos> -I feel so dirty.<eos> -She's got three kids.<eos> One apparently had some surgery as a baby.<eos> He's nine now, in a wheelchair.<eos> -So, I'm thinking...<eos> -Same thing I am.<eos> Hey, give that back, seriously!<eos> -Who wants a grilled cheese?<eos> -SAM: I do.
I think you should call Kot, just in case he's trying to intimidate you for testifying against Freddie.<eos> Lucas?<eos> I'm Lieutenant Casey.<eos> Remember me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You pulled my dad out, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well... a lot of people are looking for you.<eos> I don't want to see them.<eos> [somber music] I didn't, either.
Right, uh, so I guess Men Now really is taking off.<eos> I guess you'll just have to keep all those profits to yourself.<eos> Please.<eos> Money means nothing to me.<eos> Right, which is probably why you're driving around in those junky cars.<eos> No, we bought those junk boxes because driving around in nice cars got too expensive.<eos> I cannot tell you how many times some feminazi shattered their windshields or keyed their cars.<eos> Forensic evidence shows that Emil was struck multiple times in the head.<eos> Do you know of anyone who threatened him?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
What happens next time?<eos> I have to send him back.<eos> I have a responsibility to both these inmates and the community.<eos> It means making a lot of tough choices.<eos> Come on inside.<eos> Through this doorway is our group therapy room.<eos> And, uh, was Lola involved in group therapy as well? Certainly, yeah.<eos> We-we focus on coping mechanisms in high-stress environments.<eos> Mock interviews, conflict resolution.<eos> And how did Lola do with that?
Either you'll throw me back in prison, or he will kill me.<eos> He who?<eos> I can't tell you.<eos> I can't.<eos> Ms. Warren. Please take a look at the posterior surfaces of the left third through fifth vertebral ribs.<eos> Now, run your finger along the damage.<eos> It feels like pitting.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How does this help us find the path of the bullet?<eos> It doesn't.
Do you have the results of your swabs of the injuries?<eos> Yeah, I ran them through microspectrophotometry, and found traces of steel and also carpet fiber.<eos> It's a polyester and polyolefin blend, like what you'd find in the trunk of a car.<eos> Angela, now place the victim inside the trunk of a car.<eos> The amount of damage caused by the beating suggests the killer presumed Lola was dead when he placed her in the vehicle.<eos> You think she regained consciousness and tried to claw her way out as he was driving.<eos> Then when the killer reached the dumpsite, he found she was still alive, and he shot her.<eos> The bullet hit the bottom of the trunk with enough force to cause the blowback which ricocheted into her body.<eos> Dr. Hodgins, can you determine the kind of car based on the carpet fibers and the metal alloy?<eos> Uh, yeah, actually, I already did.
Well, that's it.<eos> That's me off.<eos> See you when you're back from the tour in... 23 weeks.<eos> - Well, call me if you need anything.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You won't, of course.<eos> - You don't need me anymore at all.<eos> - Yes, of course I do.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Neither of you does.
This had better be good, Brown.<eos> My wife is not amused.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> You sent for me? What the fuck do you want?<eos> I didn't send for anyone.<eos> "Come to the offices of the Low River Company at once.<eos> Douglas Brown."<eos> I didn't write this.<eos> I did.
Come on.<eos> Please just help us out.<eos> I cannot.<eos> I would be fired.<eos> We know about the marijuana charge in Arizona.<eos> It was just a small amount.<eos> Yeah, but there's still a warrant for your arrest.<eos> All right, listen, you talk to us, answer some questions, we'll take care of that.<eos> It's not gonna be a problem.<eos> And if I don't?
I would take it.<eos> I'd put the gun down.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Do it! Put it down.<eos> Oh, I thought you were smarter than that.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You aided and abetted a known terrorist and mass murderer.<eos> Not to mention fraud charges.<eos> I have no authority to cut you a deal.<eos> I do.
Oh, I... I had to... convince him that I believed every crazy word coming out of his mouth, just to get him to fly me back.<eos> Walker...<eos> He is dangerous, okay?<eos> He's like a fucking nuclear bomb, bouncing all over the Earth.<eos> Yeah. Without Janice, it's only a matter of time before he blows.<eos> - We got to stop him.<eos> - No, Walker, Morrison.<eos> No, Morrison doesn't exist.<eos> - I've looked...<eos> - The fuck he doesn't!
Yeah, she's taken care of.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What, so you didn't kill her? I did.<eos> A number of times.<eos> Turns out, she only has eight lives.<eos> The last one's the problem.<eos> Turns out that if she dies for good, everyone with that scar on your chest does as well.<eos> So we can't kill her. No.<eos> But the good news is the armory has her, and they're not gonna let her escape.<eos> Except for that time they did.
Um, If I win...<eos> When you win.<eos> I want to know who's behind all of this.<eos> This has never happened to me before.<eos> Ripped Corrected By mstoll<eos> We're not gonna kill anyone, are we?<eos> 'Cause I'd like to know that up front.<eos> Renard is cooperating with Black Claw.<eos> Did he know that Dixon was gonna be assassinated?<eos> Not at the time, but he does now.
He asked me for money and when I said no, he got angry.<eos> He was gonna hurt me and then Adalind came in.<eos> She told him she was gonna call the cops, and then he went after her and it just...<eos> It just happened.<eos> She broke every finger on his hand without even touching him.<eos> And then he ran away.<eos> She didn't want it to happen, but it did.<eos> She was scared of what you'd do to her.<eos> I told her she had to tell you, Nick.<eos> Well, she didn't.
Why not?<eos> Rosalee told me that Adalind is a Hexenbiest again.<eos> What?<eos> It happened when I was in Germany with Monroe.<eos> Rosalee told Adalind to tell me, but she did not.<eos> Well, now I know why you're not getting enough sleep.<eos> And that's not all.<eos> Eve told me that the captain is knowingly working with Black Claw.<eos> He knew Dixon was gonna be shot?<eos> If he didn't then, he does now.
That's why your mother and I do what we do... to keep things like that from happening.<eos> Do you really think it makes a difference?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just hope we're all together when it happens.<eos> - Paige.<eos> - And quick.<eos> It's better if we just... get wiped out straightaway than get sick or anything.<eos> You shouldn't have to think like that.<eos> Don't you think about it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Don't we have to call the police?<eos> We have to call the police.<eos> We can't do that, honey.<eos> We can't draw any attention to ourselves.<eos> Did you have to... do that?<eos> Yeah, I did.
No, you are the one who is useless.<eos> What did you say, droid?<eos> Not this time, you little...<eos> Where are those coordinates?<eos> Uh, sorry, Chopper is, um, unavailable at the moment.<eos> Who is this?<eos> I am Chopper's friend.<eos> Friend?<eos> Chopper doesn't have any friends.<eos> He most certainly does.
Okay, if Gus does not show up, I want you to walkie me.<eos> Channel 2.<eos> Or you can just give me my phone back.<eos> Nice try.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Oh, hey!<eos> Sorry, kids.<eos> I was just breaking in the new bathroom.<eos> So who want to get in the pen and help me feed the warthogs?<eos> I do!
If we run fast the animals can't catch us. Come on!<eos> - That is a suicide mission.<eos> And you're better off with them?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - Yes!<eos> Help us!<eos> Rex, prop his head up.<eos> Oh my god! Am I starting to turn into one of those things? No.<eos> We don't even know if what they have affects humans.<eos> But what if it does?
Why do you make your life harder then it needs to be?<eos> All I ever wanted is to be left alone.<eos> That's why I chose security.<eos> People usually walk the other way when they see me coming.<eos> It's fine by me.<eos> I don't need anybody to like me.<eos> I kinda like you.<eos> No you don't.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> I don't.
Do people like money-- is that what you're asking?<eos> A... a lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.<eos> Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday that's basically national sex night?<eos> I'm sorry. You're pretty, I'm stupid.<eos> Hello. Uh, just checked again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?<eos> I'm afraid so. Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think you may have dropped this?<eos> Did anybody lose a 20?<eos> I did.
I was working in a hospital up in Seattle.<eos> The next tragic series of events still haunts me.<eos> First, the power goes out.<eos> Really?<eos> Next, my idiot friend Matty starts flipping light switches to see if they're working.<eos> Next, I started getting stressed about the mess.<eos> I had surgery in the morning and I can't go to sleep with a dirty house, so I started doing the dishes.<eos> The soap must have lubed up my hands, because my Harvard class ring fell of.<eos> Did I tell you I went to Harvard?<eos> Well, I did.
Any second now, he's gonna come back, and my mind will be under siege again.<eos> This isn't something, like, I-I...<eos> Mr. Robot has become my god, and like all gods, their madness takes you prisoner.<eos> There was this...<eos> I guess I couldn't avoid Gideon's death after all.<eos> My dam of guilt is finally cracking.<eos> I want to cry, but I'm so high that I can't.<eos> There was an Indian man working behind the counter, and I made fun of his accent.<eos> And talk like this.<eos> "Hello, how you doing?"
addicts afraid to believe the truth... that there is no order, there's no power, that all religions are just metastasizing mind worms meant to divide us so it's easier to rule us by the charlatans that want to run us.<eos> All we are to them are paying fanboys of their poorly written sci-fi franchise.<eos> If I don't listen to my imaginary friend, why the fuck should I listen to yours?<eos> People think their worship's some key to happiness.<eos> That's just how he owns you.<eos> Even I'm not crazy enough to believe that distortion of reality.<eos> So fuck God.<eos> He's not a good enough scapegoat for me.<eos> Please tell me I didn't say all of that out loud.<eos> Shit. I did.
Yes, yes.<eos> We could blow up the whole Western Hemisphere, but you know me.<eos> I'm old-fashioned.<eos> I always opt for the simpler path.<eos> Occam's razor and all that.<eos> Be that as it may, it is a slower path, and time is of the essence, Phillip.<eos> I want to remind you that closing the plant is not an option.<eos> And how many minutes have you allotted for this phone call?<eos> I didn't start this game.<eos> You did.
You scraping so hard like you ain't ever asked yourself this before.<eos> I said, do you want to be here right now?<eos> And I don't mean, like, here-here, but I mean here in a cosmic sense, bro.<eos> Like, existence could be beautiful, or it could be ugly, but that's on you.<eos> How do I know which one's for me?<eos> Dream.<eos> You got to find out the future you're fighting for.<eos> Sometimes you got to close your eyes and really envision that shit, bro.<eos> If you like it, then it's beautiful.<eos> If you don't?
What?<eos> What did it say?<eos> "They've caught up with me."<eos> I knew it wasn't a stroke.<eos> It's starting again, isn't it?<eos> We need that gun.<eos> - OK, I'm not doing this.<eos> - Wyatt Earp's gun.<eos> - Same one disappeared the night... - Told you, never talk about it!<eos> - And I don't!
What's her connection to Belikov?<eos> Does she work for Belikov?<eos> I got fucking people coming after my family.<eos> How are they connected?<eos> Please, no.<eos> Please...<eos> Stop!<eos> No!<eos> I didn't realize you had a child at this school.<eos> I don't.
I'm sorry, Abs.<eos> I'm so fucking sorry.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I don't care about any of it... not the house or the money.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just want to be with you.<eos> That's it.<eos> Always have.<eos> And still do.
Don't let him bleed on my rug.<eos> Okay, here's what's gonna happen, Nick...<eos> Your brain's gonna tell you that you're drowning, and you kind of will be really drowning, so you're gonna start to believe it.<eos> Basically, this is all the fun of drowning without having to leave the dock.<eos> Now, I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> This is going to really, really suck, so my advice to you is to tell us who took care of Fiona's body right now.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Defiance. Defiance.<eos> That's an extraordinarily stupid attitude. But I like it.<eos> I really do.
You know what that means?<eos> It's jail...<eos> A record.<eos> Dad went to juvie. Didn't hurt him.<eos> Don't be a smartass.<eos> He didn't have to do that.<eos> He didn't have to scare me like that.<eos> Conor...<eos> He thinks I'm an idiot.<eos> - You all do. - No, we don't.

Get on the ground.<eos> You gonna tell me what this is all about?<eos> This? This is about seeing old friends.<eos> Who would have thought that a rich divorcÃ©e from Bel Air would be at the center of Dmitri Sokolov's LA operation?<eos> How did you find her?<eos> Waller gave her up too.<eos> We put a call in to Interpol.<eos> Customs official ID'd her in Grenada.<eos> She won't talk.<eos> Oh, she already did.
It's ahead of Trump's latest.<eos> Can you believe that cocksucker is actually running this time?<eos> I mean, if I wanted, the things I have on him could put me on his ticket.<eos> Politics... is for puppets.<eos> Besides, if you did run for office, you'd no longer be "The Last Honest Man."<eos> Thank you, Terry.<eos> Anyway, I need you to see our friend,<eos> Winston Campbell, about this issue tonight.<eos> I understand he still owes you some favors.<eos> He does.
Look over there!<eos> Well, I'm stuffed.<eos> Rocket, they're not supposed to eat anything but grass.<eos> No, no! Ugh!<eos> No!<eos> Moombas have been plotting against us this entire time, and you mock me.<eos> Check this out.<eos> The moombas have been injected with an explosive compound, but it only reacts to a certain kind of protein.<eos> Don't eat meat, no problem.<eos> But if they do...
Fall back.<eos> He means to attack.<eos> Ech, of course, the friendly ones stay.<eos> No, this is good.<eos> We can use this one to generate a portal and catch up with the rest of the herd.<eos> I am not in favor of this plan.<eos> I am Groot.<eos> What do you mean, make an antidote?<eos> Antidotes don't grow on trees.<eos> Or do they?
And then at some cheap hotel.<eos> What did you do with the key card of your hotel room?<eos> I think I put it in a bowl on the counter.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You didn't take it with you.<eos> I just said.<eos> - I put it in a bowl on the counter.<eos> - No.<eos> You said you thought you put it in a bowl on the counter.<eos> Well... I did.
But thank you.<eos> What happened?<eos> Witness saw it parked here last night.<eos> It was still here this morning so he had a look.<eos> Driver's shot.<eos> - Hassan El-Sayed?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - That's why we got it.<eos> - You said he didn't see anything.<eos> He didn't.
Steve!<eos> Hello?<eos> Steve, can you hear me?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Of course they took the phones.<eos> ♪ No work till Monday... ♪ How's it going?<eos> Hey, I'm, uh, Detective Danny Williams.<eos> I'm with Five-O.<eos> Got a badge to back that up?<eos> No, I-I don't.
I swear.<eos> Until I saw what was on it.<eos> I know that's me, but I swear it wasn't me.<eos> I would never hurt Staci.<eos> I loved her. I was at a dinner the entire time.<eos> If you don't believe me, ask Melissa or the waiter.<eos> Or any of the 75 other people that were there.<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> Relax.<eos> I do.
She was part of the elite crew that snatched me up.<eos> If, by elite crew, you mean a single, solitary, 120 pound... 115 pound, actually.<eos> I don't know, she's pretty tall.<eos> I know, but she's pretty athletic.<eos> W-W-W-W-Wait, you're saying that girl...<eos> That woman.<eos> Excuse me, that woman...<eos> No, no, she could not breach my security and kidnap me on her own.<eos> This didn't happen.<eos> Yeah, actually it did.
No, no, no, check this out.<eos> What's up? Normally, the consul general is in San Francisco, but for the past month he's been operating out of L.A.<eos> Hopefully not that consulate property in Hancock Park<eos> Callen and Sam shot up?<eos> No, it's an estate in Palos Verdes.<eos> Question is... what has he been doing in L.A. for the past month?<eos> Probably planning this charity gala.<eos> It's tonight.<eos> It starts in an hour.<eos> Of course, it does.
After everything that I just told you? - I'm sorry.<eos> - Stop saying you're sorry!<eos> Lower your voice.<eos> Drinking on shift is a fireable offense.<eos> It would be even if you didn't have the two strikes.<eos> - Yup, okay.<eos> - Chili!<eos> None of this changes how we at 51 feel about you.<eos> If you need help, just ask.<eos> I just did.
Can you please deal with Joe?<eos> And also get a therapist?<eos> Mama!<eos> That is not coming from his bedroom.<eos> Mama!<eos> I wanted a glass of water, and I got stuck.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Why didn't I close that door so you didn't get stuck like Manny's gerbil in the glue trap? !<eos> But you said he ran away.<eos> Yes, most of him did.
Wow. And that is for ever forgetting that you are the best husband.<eos> What's that for?<eos> For whatever's crawling all over me!<eos> Oh, no! They're on me, too!<eos> $40 for the hour.<eos> Songs are in the book.<eos> Anyone want a cocktail?<eos> You know how to make a Manhattan?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, you don't.
Just...<eos> Come --<eos> Hey, Dex, do you mind if I make a personal observation?<eos> If it's about my hips, blame my mother.<eos> No, no.<eos> It's - - It's about the song that you sang yesterday.<eos> It seemed like you were trying to express something -- some feelings you might be having that you think might not be met with approval from your... "community".<eos> Or it's just a song.<eos> Has nothing to do with his personal situation.<eos> -No, it does. -Ha! Ha!
There is a difference somehow!<eos> Oh, hey, kids.<eos> Actually, I'm waiting for Sarah, so if I could have the room for just a -- a minute.<eos> Thank -<eos> - Okay, funny.<eos> Whoever turned out the lights, please turn them back on.<eos> They're not working.<eos> Might be a fuse.<eos> Oh, um... Mitchell, we have a problem.<eos> No, we don't.
Hey, man!<eos> We had to cramp you home. You good?<eos> You're gonna pay for this!<eos> We'll give him another second.<eos> ♪ He's in a trunk ♪♪<eos> This is illegal, man. You can go to jail for this.<eos> You lost those rights when you let bad guys on to the tarmac to shoot people and steal old statues.<eos> I wasn't involved.<eos> They almost killed me.<eos> Yeah, but they didn't.
- Maybe he knew his killer.<eos> - I think he did.<eos> Josh was a host on ZipCouch, a new couch-surfing app for "adventurous and thrifty young travelers."<eos> Nick Mero, tech nerd turned hipster mogul, started ZipCouch when he was 28.<eos> According to Josh's profile, he was expecting a new guest last night.<eos> Meet Denise Buchwald.<eos> She's a swimsuit model who grew up on a popcorn farm just outside Des Moines.<eos> Still calls Iowa home.<eos> She doesn't look like she could kill anything.<eos> She didn't.
♪ Pump it up ♪<eos> ♪ Feel it ♪<eos> ♪ Pump it up!<eos> That's right, my friends, it's Mardi Gras, Fat Tuesday!<eos> Time to cut it loose, get the Devil out ya!<eos> I want to send a big shout-out to my man, our host this evening, Mayor Hamilton.<eos> Come on up here, Mr. Mayor!<eos> Hey!<eos> Here he is-- John Cleary!<eos> How you doing?
Let's roll.<eos> Let me see the picture.<eos> Fourth guy from the left.<eos> - Tate? - In position.<eos> All she wanted.<eos> Needed, really.<eos> You think she knows we got him?<eos> Yes.<eos> I believe she does.<eos> They both do.
Fine, you're not psycho. You're not psycho.<eos> You're delightful. Top notch.<eos> I'll answer whatever, OK? Just put my necklace back on me, please.<eos> On second thought, you're not really in a position to do any bargaining, are you?<eos> OK, look, we just need the entrance to your old bootlegging tunnels, that's it.<eos> Let's say I was willing to help you. And I ain't.<eos> Those tunnels are of no use to you or anyone.<eos> They were boarded up a long time ago.<eos> - Nobody knows how to find them.<eos> - Well, somebody does.
- The impossible.<eos> Would you girls kindly get your butts in here! Willa!<eos> How much propofol did Dolls give her?<eos> Enough to calm her down.<eos> I thought she was gonna hyperventilate to death.<eos> Yeah, I know how she feels.<eos> How can a woman recently sprung from a hippie forest cult...<eos> Be our big sister Willa?<eos> I don't know her at all.<eos> Dude, none of us do.
I remember 'cause you'd just been released from St. Victoria's.<eos> Tried to burn down your classroom.<eos> Ms. Hanson called my diorama an aberration.<eos> Stayed up all night handcrafting those little papier-mâché demons.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> You don't look a miracle in the mouth, Wy.<eos> This could heal us all.<eos> We need to get her memories back, and I don't have a magic pill for that.<eos> You could start by telling me the truth.<eos> I did.
Everyone.<eos> I let it in my head.<eos> At least you didn't have a meltdown in front of your boss.<eos> Gummy bears.<eos> Fuzzy Peaches.<eos> I remember we used to play in here with gummy bears.<eos> We would dance them across the beams and into our mouths.<eos> Then you turned 11 and you wanted to practice making out with the gummy bears.<eos> And you promised - to never tell anyone that.<eos> - I never did.
Like, if Cryderman is dirty that means someone is feeding him some BBD intel.<eos> Someone we know or someone you work for?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Black Badge isn't just a... - ...a job for me.<eos> - Yeah, no kidding.<eos> I get it. Feeling like you're about to lose something.<eos> It's OK if you don't like her, you know.<eos> I'm happy she's back, I really am. It's...<eos> I never really knew her, you know.<eos> Still don't.
It's OK if you don't like her, you know.<eos> I'm happy she's back, I really am. It's...<eos> I never really knew her, you know.<eos> Still don't.<eos> Yeah, we'll get to the bottom of it, alright?<eos> - Yeah, I'm sure you will.<eos> - All of us.<eos> You're good at what you do.<eos> Doesn't matter how many Willas come back.<eos> Doesn't.
One of our bombers was recently shot down over Old Town.<eos> Drone images show it crashed into Westhole prison.<eos> Took out a wall in the Blue Unit.<eos> Cut out all communications.<eos> Blue Unit?<eos> Where we keep our most dangerous political prisoners.<eos> We can't have the enemies of the Company running free.<eos> My job is to extinguish the Old Town rebellion, not feed it.<eos> Why not just send in Company Officers?<eos> Oh, I did, twice.
Cruella, we're not gonna let you harm these people.<eos> Oh, you think I'm just going to keep them here?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm going to keep all of you here.<eos> It's only fair, considering it was your son who refused to write me back to life, and you, you dissolved my James, the best toy in the whole playpen.<eos> I'm still waiting to hear how you're going to stop us from leaving, Fuzzy.<eos> Because all your magic can do is make a dog roll over and beg.<eos> True.<eos> I don't have the magic to keep you all penned in here.<eos> But I do.
From a guided missile destroyer?<eos> Jacob, who leaked that story to you?<eos> About Captain Chandler aboard the Nathan James.<eos> Came from one of the regional leaders.<eos> You know I can't say which one.<eos> You realize you're being used, Jacob?<eos> Used and manipulated.<eos> So they're gunning for you.<eos> I thought you said it came from only one of them.<eos> It did.
Now I have to start counting all over.<eos> Stan, what are you doing here?<eos> We told you not to worry.<eos> The thing is, I'm a worrier.<eos> I was worrying about my family, and that stressed me out, so I tried to get away from them.<eos> But I just started worrying about you guys.<eos> Turns out if I love someone, I worry about them.<eos> And if someone's gonna stress me out, I'd rather it be my family than you guys.<eos> Did Stan just say he loves us?<eos> He did, Gorney. He did.
Whoa.<eos> You think your dad would hire me?<eos> 'Cause I don't have a lot going on since I lost my frisbee in that scary bush.<eos> It'd be hell to work for my dad.<eos> He has never once said I did a good job.<eos> When I was a kid, my dad would always take me to the same beach.<eos> So for father's day, I drew him a picture of our beach.<eos> My bedtime story that night was a 45-minute critique of my drawing.<eos> Well, if it were me, I would have drawn it on a single piece of paper.<eos> I did.
You've got to fire Mr. Deliver!<eos> Look who it is...<eos> Mr. No Money, No Chocolate, telling me how to run my business.<eos> Oh, hey, Steve.<eos> Principal Lewis, this is the boy with anger issues I was telling you about.<eos> But don't expel him.<eos> Give me a chance to give him a chance.<eos> There's no way this guy's qualified to teach those kids.<eos> Well, he did go to Harvard.<eos> No, he didn't.
You can hate me.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> But the reasons matter.<eos> To me, they matter.<eos> Then I will tell you.<eos> Another time...<eos> I will tell it to you all.<eos> Everything.<eos> Anyone up here request an Uber?<eos> Yes, we did Commander.
So, rations get delivered on Tuesdays here, but, uh, with you here, I guess we get double.<eos> "Rations"?<eos> It's, uh... been less and less.<eos> You know, it's part of the reason that caused the rebellion.<eos> But we've been told there will be a harvest soon.<eos> I know this is very hard for you, Theo. But it's also hard for them, you know?<eos> To find the right balance between not enough information and too much.<eos> You know, when you, when you wake up, and you're taken out of the cryogenic pods...<eos> You don't believe this. You don't believe any of this.<eos> At first, I didn't.
And this scratch was likely caused by the killer?<eos> Which results would you like first? The swab or the ink analysis?<eos> I'll let Dr. Wells decide.<eos> The ink analysis.<eos> Okay, so I ran a thin layer chromatography on the actual plus sign.<eos> And then, to confirm the results, I actually processed it through imaging electro-spray ionization, as you can see.<eos> The results were definitive.<eos> The plus sign was made up of two different inks.<eos> As a gentleman, I will do you the courtesy of not saying "I told you so."<eos> Even though you just did.
Take a look at that, huh?<eos> Ten times more than my mortgage.<eos> Okay, she's rich. So what?<eos> Exactly, she's rich.<eos> Okay, rich people don't go around wearing nine karat gold or cubic zirconia.<eos> Only young women wear that.<eos> Yeah, but she's got a motive.<eos> Her husband was having an affair.<eos> Kerry Napoli's got an alibi.<eos> Does she?
Court business is at a standstill while the queen is away recuperating from her poisoning.<eos> However, I understand she's scheduled to return home soon.<eos> Very well.<eos> That concludes our business then.<eos> This was nice.<eos> Has been quite some time since we've seen one another.<eos> For business.<eos> I've had no need for diplomatic negotiations of late.<eos> So unless you have something else of an official nature to discuss.<eos> I do.
Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?<eos> Yeah. Why?<eos> Well, if you made a guidance system, couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?<eos> I've never thought about that.<eos> And since it's in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence.<eos> Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks.<eos> Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City.<eos> You may have actually just come up with something.<eos> You think so?<eos> I really do.
I have a feeling that what we're about to do is going to be equally frustrating.<eos> Oh, give it to me.<eos> Just tell me where I need to poke.<eos> Go down.<eos> The femoral artery runs down the inside of his leg, from the kneecap to the groin.<eos> Time out. We can't do this.<eos> You most certainly can.<eos> We're divers, not doctors.<eos> We don't even know what we're doing.<eos> But I do.
This wasn't a hit, it was a robbery.<eos> The question is: what was this guy carrying inside of his body... that was worth taking out a whole room full of people?<eos> We weren't supposed to meet for another 72 hours.<eos> Yeah, well, couldn't wait.<eos> Clearly.<eos> Okay, so what's going on?<eos> Five-O knows about you.<eos> Yeah, well, I suppose that was inevitable.<eos> The important thing is they can't know about you.<eos> They don't.
According to the information that we have, she's involved in a clandestine operation in Kiev.<eos> Ukraine?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you have any way of reaching her?<eos> My understanding is she's not scheduled to check in with her handler until the end of the week.<eos> Of course, the fear is that by then it might be too late.<eos> Commander?<eos> Do you have a direct line to Lieutenant Rollins?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Time to go.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> I can't thank you enough for doing this.<eos> Gosh, I should be thanking you.<eos> It really should only take a couple of hours.<eos> Don't even worry about it. Take your time.<eos> Kelly and I have a lot to talk about.<eos> Yes, you, we do, don't we?
Yes.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> I can't thank you enough for doing this.<eos> Gosh, I should be thanking you.<eos> It really should only take a couple of hours.<eos> Don't even worry about it. Take your time.<eos> Kelly and I have a lot to talk about.<eos> Yes, you, we do, don't we?<eos> We do.
He hitched a ride home and that stupid story It is a crazy attempt to keep his civilian guise.<eos> That, or you're a spy.<eos> A decision which I'll leave for court martial.<eos> I need to talk to this man alone.<eos> There's no chance.<eos> Captain, there are things, things about this mission that you do not know.<eos> Flash Gordon there will be under guard<eos> - Until we reach the coast.<eos> - With pleasure.<eos> And if we do not?
Once I'm settled, I assure you, I will repay you for these horses three-fold.<eos> I'm certain you'll make good on that promise, Mary, Queen of Scots.<eos> I know I speak the truth.<eos> How?<eos> Have you seen my portrait?<eos> No one in this region has been to Edinburgh Castle, let alone the portrait gallery.<eos> Rest assured, your identity is a secret here.<eos> And one I intend to keep.<eos> I don't understand how you knew.<eos> I didn't at first.
Oh, slightly domineering.<eos> Also Stefan's type.<eos> Wow.<eos> Much better.<eos> I had to get you healthy so we can do the transfer spell.<eos> Yeah, about that.<eos> There you are.<eos> Hey, check out the sky.<eos> The bartender has a theory.<eos> Of course he does.
This is it. Stardom awaits.<eos> Argh, slow down.<eos> No, I could have done, he said...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Yes, I'll be sure to pass that on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Deliveries are around the back.<eos> Actually, I'm here to see Livi.<eos> I'm sorry. I thought you just said you were here to see Livi.<eos> - I did.
Is your mother a good cook?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Oh, boy, is she the absolute best.<eos> Why did you use the word "typical" to describe your relationship?<eos> Oh, well, I think I just meant normal.<eos> Is that important to you, having your relationship described as normal?<eos> No, no, I just don't think that we are abnormal.<eos> Yes, we're close, but we had to be.<eos> You know my father died, right?<eos> I do.
It smells like cologne.<eos> Uh, yeah, this guy, Scott Rice, friend of Severide's.<eos> Well, sort of.<eos> Didn't really end well.<eos> Huh. - What? - What?<eos> What what?<eos> I said Severide's name, and your face turned all 50 shades of red.<eos> - You guys know each other?<eos> - My face got 50 shades of red?<eos> - It... it did. - Okay.
All right.<eos> Edna, always a pleasure.<eos> You men think I don't know what's going on, but I know.<eos> And don't you go spitting that out.<eos> I made it fresh this morning.<eos> I hope you cleaned the bathtub out beforehand.<eos> That's what I like about you, Jake.<eos> You're a funny guy.<eos> Sense of humor's important, don't you think?<eos> I do.
There he is.<eos> The mono-syllabic Sam you used to know?<eos> No, the cool Sam.<eos> And look at you now, the winner-takes-all lawyer you've become.<eos> Said by the NSA hard-ass you've become.<eos> How'd you know about that disagreement?<eos> NSA hard-ass, remember?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> If one of my associates talked to the NSA out of school, you have the obligation to inform me.<eos> Anna didn't.
We don't have much time, so listen to me carefully.<eos> Kirsten?<eos> I'm picking up the anomaly again.<eos> Find the source.<eos> You have a sister.<eos> Kirsten?<eos> Um, Cameron, I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, any one of them could have wanted Anna out of their way.<eos> My parents had another daughter?<eos> Your father did with his first wife, Elizabeth.
Based on your tone, something that pisses you off.<eos> You know, when I was your age, you broke a tool, you had to craft a new one with your own bare hands.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna have to call BS on that one.<eos> What gave it away?<eos> The smile on my face?<eos> I know, I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> Yeah, it's no big deal.<eos> We're all done here.<eos> Yeah, it's just, I didn't hear the alarm, so...<eos> Oh, I did.
Never mind.<eos> I heard a good joke today.<eos> So... a horse walks into a bar, right?<eos> Why would a horse walk into a bar?<eos> To get a drink.<eos> It's a horse.<eos> He'd drink outside in a trough.<eos> Well, this horse wanted something stronger.<eos> Horses don't drink alcohol.<eos> This one does.
Anyway, the, uh, funeral's less than a day's drive.<eos> I say we go pay our respects.<eos> Uh... Don't you think o-our plates are a little full?<eos> I mean, it's bad out there, Dean.<eos> Yeah, Sam.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> We've done nothing but mainline lore for a week, okay?<eos> We've got Jack on another hand of God and Amara, and we've got even less Jack on how to save Cass.<eos> If he wants to be saved.<eos> He does...
My wife is flying back, but her flight's been delayed in London, so...<eos> I'm alone in all this.<eos> Well, we're to help however we can.<eos> I appreciate that, but... why would the FBI have any interest in this?<eos> Just...doing our due diligence.<eos> You know what?<eos> Why don't you go ahead and tell us about the night of the attack?<eos> Nobody believes there was an attack.<eos> E-Even the Internet thinks I'm crazy.<eos> Well, we don't.
If you want to leave, I get it.<eos> But if you want to help me...<eos> I'm looking for pretty much anything with "barbital" in the name.<eos> This will work?<eos> It has to.<eos> Okay.<eos> After I do this, go get the doc and tell her to, um...<eos> If not... no hard feelings, okay?<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I can help.<eos> My dad's a plumber.<eos> No, that's okay.<eos> I got it. Um...<eos> Uh... she's not feeling well, so you should just get out of here.<eos> You can leave the basket there.<eos> Call the police, go, go, go, go, go, go.<eos> Would you please lock it?<eos> If I hear sirens, 'cause you just told those two kids to call the police, I am gonna cut off her nose right in front of you.<eos> - I didn't.
It goes beyond cosmetic.<eos> She's in critical condition.<eos> I can't make any promises.<eos> But we have our best surgeons on it.<eos> Well, we all want to donate blood.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, everybody who's donating blood, y'all follow me.<eos> Right now, let's go.<eos> I understand Ms. Dunhill ended her relationship with you?<eos> Yeah, she did.
Mr. Amberson, Jack Kennedy here.<eos> The Secret Service tells me that, uh, my wife and I, uh, owe you our lives.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome, sir.<eos> The First Lady would like to speak with you.<eos> All right.<eos> - Mr. Amberson?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> I don't know how to say this, but I had a feeling that something terrible could've happened today.<eos> Thanks to you, it didn't.
Liam.<eos> That Liam?<eos> Is he the reason you weren't at the library?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You wanna know why?<eos> Because he's connected to Daniel Stinger.<eos> And Maggie wanted me to find out what information I could get on him.<eos> I suppose she didn't want you telling me.<eos> No, I wasn't allowed to tell anyone.<eos> So, I didn't.
I'm right behind you!<eos> Where are Mickey and Minnie Mouse going?<eos> Max, where were you?<eos> You're late, we lost the space, and I had to learn that our real estate agent wants to have sex with Han, but remain a... front virgin.<eos> Please understand me. Oh, she's working the ol' loophole argument?<eos> What, you never heard of that?<eos> The girls at St. Bridget's invented it.<eos> I can't take any more of this!<eos> That's what they said!<eos> But then they did.
There was a while back I was doing pretty good.<eos> We all go through rough patches.<eos> When you, uh... first came to see me, I was...<eos> I was a little cold to you.<eos> - Yeah, you were.<eos> - Mom.<eos> Look, if this is some sort of apology... it's just a little late.<eos> Just let her talk.<eos> I wish I could go back and change our history, but life doesn't work like that.<eos> Nope, it doesn't.
I wanna talk about the Red Reef Motel a little bit more.<eos> Have you been back there since the night of the murder?<eos> Once.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Someone tried to kill Danny.<eos> I'm a cop, I wanted answers.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - Did we come up with the same answers?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Did we?
- Yep.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Robert used to sing that song for the kids, all the time.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Danny told me.<eos> That's why I learned it.<eos> And Danny used to sing it to Nolan when he was a baby.<eos> Danny couldn't sing.<eos> Yeah, but he did it anyway.
I can't screw this up.<eos> Hey.<eos> This thing between you and me wasn't gonna last forever.<eos> You knew that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did I?<eos> It's crazy 'cause I'm the only one who's ever really taken care of you.<eos> I mean, your parents didn't.<eos> Right?<eos> Danny didn't.
It wasn't my idea.<eos> A chambermaid of Anne's claimed to have seen Anne and her brother George... together.<eos> Wait, a chambermaid said this?<eos> Anne's night maid.<eos> But he knew that no one would believe it unless it came from someone like me, a close friend to Anne.<eos> And so he turned the screws on my family.<eos> Threats... and promises.<eos> After the trial, Henry awarded me the Boleyn family lands.<eos> And Henry knew the chambermaid's story was a lie.<eos> Of course he did.
That might be true, but these photos are mug shots taken of Sang Min for crimes committed during his illustrious career as a criminal.<eos> Looks like an evolutional chart.<eos> Only, it's going the other way.<eos> Do you recall what offense you committed when this mug shot was taken?<eos> Why don't you tell me, Paco?<eos> I'd be happy to.<eos> It's from... your early years as a criminal mastermind.<eos> When you and James Lam were arrested for extortion.<eos> Only, Lam never went to prison.<eos> And you did.
Lock them up for jaywalking if you have to.<eos> Start flipping these guys one at a time.<eos> Someone is gonna talk, especially if they're looking at time.<eos> - Commander.<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> Reverend.<eos> I don't have to tell you that this case is the highest priority right now<eos> Sergeant.<eos> You know Reverend Pembelton?<eos> Yes, I do.
All right, thanks.<eos> That was Vikan from the gang unit.<eos> He said Brian is affiliated with the gang, but he's not a trigger man.<eos> He does just enough to not have fellow gang members question his allegiance.<eos> He can't imagine any scenario in which the G Park Lords would put a hit on Brian, let alone on his 6-year-old son.<eos> Good news.<eos> We could use some.<eos> I was able to contact Maurice Owens.<eos> Know of him?<eos> I do.
Okay. Sorry to barrage you with more questions, Janet.<eos> I just can't believe it.<eos> Me and Finny were just goofing around, like always, and the last thing I said to him... that no one had a gun to his head... it's one of those things you sort of say without thinking and... the next thing I knew, he...<eos> It's okay, Janet.<eos> "Finn's gone."<eos> That's what he said to me.<eos> With a smile on his face.<eos> Was it this man who said it?<eos> No.<eos> The one doing all the talking.
American missionary work anywhere in Africa is hardly unusual.<eos> True, Doc, but this is our second Africa reference of the day.<eos> The first was Beimler in Zaire, and now this.<eos> Ah, and what doctors do we know with experience in the Sudan?<eos> Oh, hey, what about our friends in the international doctors' group-- the-the ones you rescued.<eos> Uh, David Woods and his wife Jeanne?<eos> There's no way they're involved, boss. I didn't say they were.<eos> Well, of course not, but they might know people who might know people.<eos> And right now, we don't have a whole hell of a lot else to go on, do we, DiNozzo?<eos> No, we don't, boss.
Bye.<eos> How low can we go?<eos> You talking to me?<eos> Stood up at a diner.<eos> Makes us both pretty sad cases, I'm just saying.<eos> Nah, I'm not sad.<eos> Or stood up.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> I got a friend coming.<eos> Doesn't everybody?
Maybe I've just been spending too much time with Wesen.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> Look, if you keep having these dreams, just make sure to call Rosalee.<eos> I'm sure she has something that can make you sleep better.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Look, uh, I'm just gonna get changed, and I'm coming back in.<eos> Oh, no. You're staying home.<eos> Will you please take the day off?<eos> I mean, Portland will survive one day without you.<eos> And what if it doesn't?
I suppose I do.<eos> It's okay.<eos> What if we couldn't get in this way?<eos> You've already done the hard part.<eos> No.<eos> The next part is the hard part.<eos> After that, they'll never recover.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> Your feelings matter.<eos> No, they don't.
All right.<eos> You're really gonna leave him in jail?<eos> Kid needs to grow up.<eos> I feel for him.<eos> Well, it can't be easy being Walter Davidson's son.<eos> No.<eos> Here he is, Mr. Harley.<eos> Thank you very much, Officer.<eos> My dad didn't come down? Uh, no.<eos> No, Walt, he didn't.
Ahh. While on the topic of foreign lands, I think the future...<eos> We need to look outward, boys...<eos> Internationally.<eos> A Japanese company wants to purchase our designs and manufacturing know-how.<eos> Buy? Not lease?<eos> Buy.<eos> As in Harley-Davidson Motorcycles with someone else's name on it.<eos> What's the difference between a Harley-Davidson bike with a Japanese name on it and one that says Ford?<eos> You know about the Ford proposal.<eos> I do.
Come on.<eos> I got it!<eos> Do they know where their son is? No idea.<eos> Jake's cell phone's off.<eos> They gave me the number of some of his friends.<eos> I'll make some calls.<eos> But Jake's parents are scared and worried.<eos> They don't know any more than we do.<eos> And you believe them?<eos> Yes, I do.
Because an expert marksman like that would have kept a family heirloom locked away in a case.<eos> Which was my hope for the evening.<eos> Any chance for a refill, Inspector Clouseau?<eos> Ah.<eos> Sure.<eos> And speaking of marksmen, there's no way Petty Officer Muldoon would've taken three shots to drop that guy.<eos> He would've nailed him on the first shot.<eos> He's a pro.<eos> Yeah, well, pros do miss on the first shot.<eos> You sure as hell did.
That's a good look for you.<eos> Abby...<eos> I told you to go home.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> And miss an all-nighter?<eos> I feel like I'm 13 years old at Missy Trayman's house when her dad passed out drunk and we got to stay up till dawn.<eos> Now that I think about it, Missy had a pretty sad childhood.<eos> Okay.<eos> You said you had something.<eos> I do.
I know.<eos> We talked a lot.<eos> But just as friends.<eos> She finally told me about being raped.<eos> She said I was the first guy she felt safe with since it happened.<eos> So... how do you jump from that to "Want to grab a drink sometime?"<eos> I'm the last guy you want to take advice on women from.<eos> So what now?<eos> She had a case for self-defense.<eos> She still does.
Yes. She cheat on Sunday crosswords?<eos> Regularly.<eos> But she would never steal money from her own charity.<eos> And she damn sure wasn't involved in trying to kill anyone.<eos> Patton, you're too close.<eos> Come on! You got to admit there are a lot of unanswered questions.<eos> We need to check Kayla out.<eos> That's just what we do.<eos> We need to look into her personal computer.<eos> No, we don't.
- What else did you see?<eos> You know my mind.<eos> I'm after that crown.<eos> You help me get it, and I'll help you find the Hammer of Tek.<eos> The one weapon that could destroy the Darkspore, once and for all.<eos> - The Happer of Tek is gone, no one knows where.<eos> And no mortal can wield it.<eos> - Well, with the Iron Crown of the Dwarves, I could.<eos> - Szorlok has the Iron Crown.<eos> - That he does.
Let's go inside and do business.<eos> All right, they're inside.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, we need to get to that shed.<eos> Slight problem.<eos> The stun gun that Tim gave us back at the base must've been hit by a stray rock on the drive. Shoot.<eos> It's broken.<eos> We need that.<eos> No, we don't.
I escaped into the night.<eos> Before he caught up with me, I've... I found a barn full of horses.<eos> [Sighing] I tore apart every single one.<eos> Nothing I could do to stop it.<eos> And so why are we here?<eos> We should go back home where Alexei can't hurt anyone, where it's safe.<eos> We give Elena time.<eos> We let her absorb what I've told her, okay?<eos> We don't have time.<eos> Alexei doesn't.
Oh. Born and raised in L.A.<eos> Former Army Special Forces.<eos> Says here he's working overseas.<eos> He has an aunt that lives in Pasadena.<eos> We should go talk to her, see if she knows anything.<eos> Sure, we could do that.<eos> Or we could just pretend you never found this.<eos> Fine.<eos> But my dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.<eos> Of course he does.
- "We"?<eos> - We.<eos> Yeah, "we."<eos> We.<eos> You and me. We.<eos> You know...<eos> Dr. Edwards is such a good doctor, and, um... and I know you've been working hard, but real change takes time, and if you just work with him just a little longer, you'll be that much stronger when you do come home.<eos> All right?<eos> That makes sense, doesn't it?<eos> It does.
So, I'm guessing you had nothing to do with bringing it on yourself.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Can we not?<eos> I need to win this court case so I can clear away the mess of my life and start fresh.<eos> Well, my cab is waiting, so if you wouldn't mind signing my form.<eos> - Are you married?<eos> - I was married for 26 years.<eos> Now I'm divorced.<eos> Potential Juror number 11, before your divorce, did you and your husband ever seek any kind of counseling or therapy?<eos> Yes, we did.
And besides, the publisher is your purview.<eos> Yes, but we'll make a much better case that Masters Johnson are back on track if both Masters and Johnson are in that room.<eos> Together.<eos> I've already asked Betty to book the first flight.<eos> You just... assumed I'd go?<eos> I... hoped.<eos> There... there's no way.<eos> I have to review this statement, and, uh, I'm working on a list of questions for the prosecution's witnesses.<eos> You really don't think that Keller's got that covered?<eos> What if he doesn't?
I need to know what the witness is gonna say.<eos> Uh... here it is.<eos> Eliot Laskin.<eos> Hmm? Bachelor.<eos> Lives in an apartment in Rock Hill, works at the Shawnee Country Club, before that as a bellhop at the Park Chancery Hotel...<eos> The Park Chancery?<eos> He... he's got nothing to do with this case.<eos> Prosecution thinks he does.<eos> Well, believe me.<eos> He doesn't.
The Park Chancery?<eos> It's a time that we were at our best.<eos> The way we can be again.<eos> For godssake, Virginia I can't.<eos> Because...?<eos> Because you you don't love me.<eos> What?<eos> That is preposterous.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You don't.
- You want your friends to live, you're gonna do something for us.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Easy, Marty.<eos> The witch chose us three for a reason.<eos> Each of us guarding a different piece of the puzzle!<eos> I knew about the hand, Gary hid the stupid book; now I need you to get your piece!<eos> We didn't trust each other and now look what I done!<eos> Put down the knife! The heir's gonna help us!<eos> I do know the numbers.<eos> 'Least, I did!
But I couldn't stop.<eos> I... you know, I was already coming.<eos> And he-he looked scared.<eos> He thought I... that I was trying to hurt his mother.<eos> And that's how our problem started.<eos> Is that something that can be treated?<eos> It is.<eos> Do you masturbate successfully on your own?<eos> - I do.<eos> - He does.
And I'm not ready to leave the clinic when we've barely begun our tenure.<eos> And I'm not willing to put up with as much as you are.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> How I must look.<eos> Raccoon eyes, huh?<eos> And here I... I wanted to take your breath away.<eos> As if I still could.<eos> Oh, I'm sure you take your husband's breath away.<eos> Oh, he-he doesn't look at me.<eos> Or he does.
You know where she is now?<eos> Bar.<eos> Liquor store, hotel room.<eos> I don't suppose it's a coincidence, Louise picking up a drink the week we began treatment.<eos> How very astute of you, Doc.<eos> See, you gave her hope.<eos> She thought she had found a cure.<eos> Abracadabra, I come in and you'd wave your magic wand, and just like that it'd all be better.<eos> I tried.<eos> I really did.

What in the world are you talking about, Harry?<eos> Well, all around 'em, there was nothing but black, and they were wearing those helmets too, so where their faces should have been, there's just more black, like, uh, they were lost or... invisible.<eos> Are you all right, Daddy?<eos> Harry, I think you've had enough to drink tonight.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It's getting late anyhow.<eos> Do you mind giving me a hand with the dishes before you go?<eos> Sure, sweetheart.<eos> I'm sure Gini mentioned that, uh, I came in to see her.<eos> - Uh, yes. Yes, she did.
You confessed the one thing you knew would end our marriage in a room you knew was being taped.<eos> Sometimes what we want can surprise even us.<eos> I assumed you called me in because of my last session with Cherlyn, which was very successful.<eos> This isn't about your last session.<eos> Or your time here as a patient.<eos> This is about your work with us as our publisher.<eos> Our relationship to Little, Brown.<eos> Which we assumed was an exclusive relationship, in that we've given you the rights to all our work.<eos> And in entrusting our work to you, we assumed it would engender a loyalty between us, one that went both ways.<eos> Of course it does.
- All up in the bug juice. You don't know the flavor, woman.<eos> We said - no trash talk in the bedroom.<eos> We said no work talk in the bedroom.<eos> Just for the record, I am right. You are wrong.<eos> Meddler.<eos> I still think - I should wait until next year to apply for the grant.<eos> Why?<eos> You're eligible now.<eos> Technically, but they always give the grant to a senior resident anyway.<eos> Except for when they don't.
Oh. God bless your heart.<eos> I'm glad you told me... about Jackson's father.<eos> Now you understand why I'm doing this.<eos> Not a bit.<eos> Ah. It was an awfully sad story.<eos> But it was your story, not theirs, and stop trying to make it theirs.<eos> I don't have a choice, Richard.<eos> The woman I married... believed in second chances... that anything was possible... and that the glass doesn't always have to be half empty.<eos> And you said your ex-husband didn't know the woman he married.<eos> Well, I do.
- Do you hear me?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> Not when you're having my grandbaby.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Listen, what I said before, that was just me being...<eos> Insecure.<eos> I deserve that.<eos> You could have said a lot worse.<eos> I did... earlier.
Kevin! No, we have to go back for Kevin.<eos> Your friend is fine.<eos> They're not after him.<eos> I thought...<eos> I thought they were gonna kill him.<eos> They were gonna shoot him unless I did something.<eos> They needed validation.<eos> Proof that you have what they're looking for.<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't!
Just like that?<eos> Do you have any idea what a slap in the face this is?<eos> How long?<eos> !<eos> How long have I been sitting on a couch discussing my marriage with someone who has already checked out?<eos> - That's not what I was doing.<eos> - I just want to know when it happened.<eos> When did you decide that you were done?<eos> - She didn't say that.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
- Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Too bad you won't be getting any sleep.<eos> I don't want to talk, because you know what?<eos> I know what you're gonna say!<eos> You're gonna say "You love me, but"!<eos> You don't know what I'm going to say!<eos> - Oh, I'm pretty sure I do.<eos> - It doesn't matter!<eos> You don't!
No!<eos> What happened?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Sorry, Sunset.<eos> Uh, Twilight, I think something happened.<eos> (screams)<eos> (yelp)<eos> (sigh) Is it time to get up already?<eos> Twilight, we really have to talk about this.<eos> No, we don't.
There you are.<eos> Filthy Rich is back.<eos> - You want me to handle it?<eos> - Absolutely not!<eos> I've got this!<eos> (screaming)<eos> Fluttershy, enough with the screaming.<eos> - I didn't scream.<eos> - For once.<eos> Nobody did.
Oh, here you go.<eos> Pinky, don't!<eos> (sigh)<eos> What?<eos> Ooh, did you think the nails would explode like the sprinkles?<eos> Wow, glad that didn't happen, huh?<eos> Sorry girls, I didn't mean to.<eos> I don't know how to control this.<eos> It's okay.<eos> None of us do.
As you intend to race off to Scotland, I'm curious, what will you do about Lola?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> She's still in England.<eos> And once your military campaign to reclaim your Scottish throne goes public, well, I don't imagine Elizabeth will react well.<eos> Are you really playing the concerned husband now?<eos> You are Elizabeth's rival.<eos> Once you're ruling on England's borders, then Lola's value as a hostage increases tenfold.<eos> Elizabeth will keep my wife captive forever.<eos> But I don't suppose that even crossed your mind, did it?<eos> Actually, it did.
Sleep tight, we're fine.<eos> Hell, they hardly even know we exist.<eos> All right, that's enough outta you today.<eos> - On campus we're a name, but off campus in the middle of the country,<eos> - where the voters are... - Hey, listen.<eos> We've had enough of you talking.<eos> We're just the kids who skip class, call it a sit-in.<eos> Yeah, well, if that bomb would have gone off,<eos> - different story.<eos> - Well, it didn't, so...
Obviously, there'll be some failures, such as yours.<eos> Which is why we need to encourage the First Generation to bear children as quickly as possible.<eos> I understand that.<eos> But you can preserve humanity and try to hold on to some, at the same time.<eos> You do realize you're asking children to bear children.<eos> Ye... it-it's a survival strategy used by numerous societies.<eos> Primitive societies.<eos> Megan, these girls should have a choice.<eos> Lucy has a choice.<eos> Actually, Rebecca, she really doesn't.
Pilcher sent a dozen nomads in a dozen directions out beyond the fence. And Adam's the only one who's ever returned.<eos> They're gone.<eos> This is a rare opportunity.<eos> With the Abbies retreated, we can work without fear.<eos> I want to come with you.<eos> Let me find my son.<eos> But every time one thing here seems almost rational, two things pop up that make absolutely no sense at all.<eos> Every member of our community has a duty to ensure the future of the human race.<eos> Lucy has a choice.<eos> Actually, Rebecca, she really doesn't.
Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> If they can learn, let's teach 'em some consequences.<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> Hey, think about it... if you kill her, we all die!<eos> Kerry.<eos> If she does control them, is killing her a risk you want to take?<eos> I don't have an answer yet for what will end this war, but eliminating what I believe is a crucial piece of it is not what I would advise.<eos> Or do my words not hold any weight for you anymore?<eos> Of course they do.
And when you wake up, I will be there, too.<eos> Wherever I am... and wherever you are.<eos> Come on.<eos> The last group is moving towards the pods.<eos> Which we hope will work.<eos> There are no guarantees in this life.<eos> You're a surgeon; you know this.<eos> I've had lives in my hands.<eos> Held a human heart, beating.<eos> Did one earlier today, as a matter of fact.
- Sure. The people with the most spears.<eos> - But there's more to it than that.<eos> I mean, we sacrifice some of our, um, independence to a government in return for security. And a kind of collective wisdom.<eos> Security's just another word for "the most spears."<eos> Every time there was a vote, the minority didn't count up the spears and, uh, decide not to revolt.<eos> Once you make the deal to have a government, that government takes on another kind of authority.<eos> What, like a moral authority?<eos> - Well--<eos> - So Ronald Reagan has moral authority?<eos> Of course he does!
Okay, if there's one thing Ronald Reagan definitely does not have, it's moral authority.<eos> Sure has a great head of hair, though.<eos> Sorry, just kidding.<eos> Continue.<eos> Let me put it like this-- if the states had voted on slavery, we would have lost the vote.<eos> So, yeah, at that point, moral authority kicks in to, uh, defend the minority against the will of the people.<eos> And that's when the spears come out.<eos> Yeah, I watched the news last night too, Barry.<eos> Jesse Jackson said that thing about slavery.<eos> Yeah, he did.
You look amazing.<eos> So, what you think?<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Whatever you say, B. Enjoy yourself, though.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - How you doin', PJ?<eos> - I'm good, Ms. Denise.<eos> - I'm fair for a square.<eos> How you doing?
Right-right. Uh, Parisian pasta porcino.<eos> It's a technique.<eos> An artistry, if you're good.<eos> High-power polish, small arcs with a trowel...<eos> Uh, that movement would create a reverse pattern of what we see on the photo.<eos> This guy's a lefty.<eos> Didi, I got something for you.<eos> So I talked to the contractors from all five houses.<eos> And all used the same Parisian pasta porcino guy, didn't they?<eos> No. But two of them did.
You're sure enjoying it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Last night, as I went to sleep,<eos> I thought, "Tomorrow I hope to stand around"<eos> "in the alley behind the station" "talking to some hairy, bug-eyed munchkin."<eos> And here we are.<eos> You can joke on me all you want, but something's happened to her.<eos> Something she didn't choose.<eos> Now, I don't got the resources to find out what.<eos> But you do.
Charlie, man, it's a process, with the boys.<eos> It's always kind of, like, evolving.<eos> It's not...<eos> It's not even my words, my melody.<eos> It's...<eos> It's not my nothing!<eos> It's got to be mine.<eos> Change it back.<eos> Look, I liked your version.<eos> We both did, right?
That's a fairly risky career path.<eos> What do you think?<eos> About?<eos> About what we're talking about.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm not myself today.<eos> Thank you, Charmain.<eos> Sure.<eos> We got a meeting with Cutler.<eos> We do?
You're wise beyond your size.<eos> Okay, we got ourselves an egg hunt!<eos> Let's search every tree hole, rabbit hole, watering hole, and ice hole in this entire valley.<eos> We'll find 'em.<eos> I promise.<eos> - Hey, don't you want to follow the map?<eos> - Map, schmap.<eos> We have a D.T.S. Diego tracking system.<eos> My nose, and these instincts, can't miss.<eos> They just did.
And then, therefore by doing that, they find love.<eos> Then, the concept came up, the love triangle, Scrat, nut and girl, Scratte.<eos> The Scrat sequences in general are not scripted.<eos> They are all invented in story and with the director.<eos> Carlos definitely had the idea of the Scrat arc, meeting the girl and a basic idea of what would happen.<eos> But as far as every individual sequence, they leave it to us.<eos> The first thing we do is a first rough pass.<eos> Rough, dirty awful looking drawings, and then you pitch them in front of the whole room.<eos> You act it out.<eos> You do voices.
But yes, I agree.<eos> Wendy, what do you think?<eos> Schwing!<eos> You're all crazy.<eos> I spent years with that guy, watching him get high and fail at selling pot because he was too paranoid to answer the door.<eos> Yeah, but he's all cleaned up now.<eos> He's got a good job, bright future, and without hair, probably moves pretty quick through the water.<eos> - (Laughter)<eos> - Christy, all kidding aside, do you still have feelings for this man?<eos> Yeah, do you?
Nah, we gotta get going.<eos> Our movie's at 2:00.<eos> Mom, why don't you come with us?<eos> Oh, uh, no, this is... Time you spend with your Dad.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> Come on, Christy.<eos> It'll be fun.<eos> Sure.<eos> I don't see why not.<eos> - I do.
Yes.<eos> Not sure I ever imagined what breathing through one lung would feel like.<eos> Turns out there's barely any difference.<eos> Good. Good.<eos> Though... probably wise to let the Princess Elizabeth undertake the Commonwealth tour? Hm?<eos> What say you?<eos> - Is she up to it?<eos> - Yes, I'd say so.<eos> Besides... we have to start breaking her in gently, don't we?<eos> Do we?
- Drawing room!<eos> - Now?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We do both so love living at Clarence House and he has all sorts of ideas about how to modernize it.<eos> He really is rather ingenious like that, actually.<eos> - Now, Peter.<eos> - Your Majesty. Your Royal Highnesses.<eos> I have to make a decision about Christmas.<eos> Tell me, do you think the King will be well enough to go to Sandringham?<eos> I do.
There he is.<eos> There's my Tommy-boy.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm sorry to just...<eos> I was in the neighborhood, and suddenly I said, "Oh.<eos> This is where Tommy lives." So, I...<eos> I hope I'm not interrupting.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> Dion, this is Pilar.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
This weather front from the Atlantic continues to bring heavy rain... Right...<eos> I'm going to turn in.<eos> Bill, Moira, I'm so sorry to burst in like this but a man's just driven off the road by our place.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Is he...?<eos> Is he badly hurt?<eos> We don't know right now.<eos> we've called an ambulance, but God knows when it's going to get here.<eos> Claire needs some medical things -- she thought you might have some for the animals.<eos> Of course I do.
I must caution you that here in the north, Death can be brutal. And come without warning.<eos> I do hope you understand. The world you find yourselves in.<eos> I have faced far more formidable circumstances, lord benton,<eos> And not only have I survived, I found the experience... Fulfilling.<eos> But I appreciate your concern for our welfare.<eos> It's late.<eos> We are raw from travel.<eos> Perhaps a meeting tomorrow?<eos> I do have a proposition for you.<eos> You yankees always do.
God, I love you.<eos> Bash, you've been quiet this journey.<eos> Is something troubling you?<eos> You needn't worry about me.<eos> - It was my choice to come here to serve you, to protect you, and I will.<eos> You're not responsible for me or my happiness.<eos> So, my maids' gossip is true.<eos> And I thought Melaniee came along<eos> - because she could cook.<eos> - She did.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Well, I hope she's worth it, 'cause right now, she looks like a scared kid in way over her head to me.<eos> Yeah, well, don't tell the attorney general that.<eos> To wrangle this rendition, I had to make it seem like Hijriyyah held the key to Hizb Al-Shahid's entire network.<eos> Maybe she does.
I know.<eos> We can change the locks.<eos> It's not about the locks.<eos> It's this place. I hate it here.<eos> No, no!<eos> You're just gonna try and change my mind.<eos> We should at least have this conversation instead of calling some stranger.<eos> In case you haven't noticed I don't have anyone else to talk to.<eos> We're gonna catch this freak.<eos> And what if they don't?
I almost want to let him go myself, except for one thing... he's a liar.<eos> He thinks he doesn't have to play by the same rules. But we know he does.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - I pled guilty.<eos> If you think I'm gonna let you do this, you're out of your goddamn mind.<eos> He cut a deal to save this firm.<eos> He cut a deal to keep us from going to prison.<eos> We give Evan people who already want to go, and I give Anita Gibbs murderers in exchange for Mike.<eos> And what if it doesn't work and we lose everything?<eos> Then we do.
They just walked the hell out and went somewhere else.<eos> Then we can sue their asses.<eos> With what lawyers, what resources, and what money?<eos> Because I don't know if you noticed, but this firm has been gutted because of your recommendation.<eos> No, Jessica, it was gutted because of mine.<eos> Damn it, Louis.<eos> I told you not to call him. Well, I did.<eos> Because he's a partner, and like he just said, he was the one who wanted to sever the noncompetes in the first place.<eos> You're right, Louis.<eos> I did.
Then we need to know who the hell tipped them off.<eos> It doesn't matter who tipped them off.<eos> What matters is, if we lose this suit, we can't handle the money.<eos> How much are they suing us for?<eos> - $100 million.<eos> - God damn it.<eos> We need to get those partners back.<eos> I told you, we're never gonna get them back.<eos> And right now we don't even know where they went.<eos> I do.
My God, she knew.<eos> I got news for you, Louis.<eos> They always know.<eos> Oh, you're so right.<eos> You're so right.<eos> She... I need 15 minutes to myself.<eos> And that's it.<eos> I cut a deal, and now I'm here. Wait a second.<eos> If you're a fake lawyer, they had to give you a chance to turn on someone to get out of it.<eos> They did.
Sure thing, kid.<eos> Just give it back when you're done.<eos> Well, now that we're starting fresh, can we please finally get rid of that hideous duck painting?<eos> - No, Louis, we can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because it's like you.<eos> I can't stand it, but it's part of the family.<eos> Speaking of family, where's Gretchen?<eos> I can't believe she would walk out on us too.<eos> She didn't.
Morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Hell of a drive, huh?<eos> Halfway here, I was thinking I should've packed my passport.<eos> Flat white?<eos> We're doing a run.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> That'd be great.<eos> I thought she got to choose her own Counsel Assisting.<eos> She did. Oh, wow!
Andy? Mate?<eos> Excuse me. I'm sorry.<eos> So let's think about Todd Wilson.<eos> What do we know already?<eos> Pretty popular at school, good footballer, both parents deceased.<eos> Studied electrical engineering at TAFE.<eos> Fixed EFTPOS machines for a living.<eos> Married his best mate's sister two years ago.<eos> That's Elaheh? Correct.<eos> She did science.
That was really great.<eos> It's gonna make a huge difference.<eos> Hang on. Um, everyone?<eos> Doing all our surveillance now, Sergeant Grieve from the AFP.<eos> Please, Bianca.<eos> TI's activated and timing of ID installs on three houses, plus the roster for 'Eyes On Keisha' that began last night.<eos> So far, she came straight home from work.<eos> Hasn't left. I've gotta run but I'll meet everyone later.<eos> She knows her stuff.<eos> She does.
How is any of this my fault?<eos> What did I do to you?<eos> Tell me.<eos> What did you do?<eos> You were born.<eos> Born an Al Fayeed.<eos> You are here because of what your family did to mine.<eos> My father's trying to change that.<eos> You think you know your father?<eos> You don't.
You can come and visit a few times a month.<eos> But if not for me, then at least for Isabela.<eos> Are you sure it's me, or is it just another political ploy?<eos> Do you sincerely doubt me?<eos> After all that's happened between us these past few days?<eos> I've been telling everybody how much I need you.<eos> This battle between us is over.<eos> But I need you to give me the girl, Teresa.<eos> When my son was murdered by the cartel, I spent every waking hour trying to find the man who did it.<eos> I never did.
10... 10,000. But if we...<eos> Motorcycle industry is booming. And you limit your potential with sentiment.<eos> You should never have written that editorial.<eos> You'll never catch up with Indian after that.<eos> We did what we thought best.<eos> Those motordromes sell out darn near every event.<eos> Their riders are stars.<eos> Now, some of them dead stars, sir.<eos> They basically make money for the manufacturers, you know. And fans love it.<eos> Everyone does.
Plus Otto Walker's a war hero.<eos> He was discharged early. And Jones comes home in a week.<eos> We're back, art!<eos> Listen, Walt. I got a job at the dealership now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What if this racing thing's a bust, they don't take me back?<eos> You want to sell them or ride them?<eos> People are already flocking to the tracks. Just wait until the wrecking crew resurfaces.<eos> Plus, we got a war hero.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Thank you.<eos> We're being sued.<eos> It's a class-action lawsuit for infringement on the patented clutch design from Indian, excelsior, a few others.<eos> What?<eos> This isn't anything.<eos> Everyone steals from each other.<eos> We didn't steal anything.<eos> I designed the damn thing. I...<eos> You just didn't patent it?<eos> Well, apparently, someone else did.
Warren's married to the Chief, so he's scrubbed in down there on a surgery while we're stuck watching up here.<eos> You don't think the two are related?<eos> I know they are.<eos> - It's unfair.<eos> - Uncool.<eos> Lame.<eos> So lame.<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> We sound just like...<eos> Yeah, we do.
His mother agreed.<eos> Clear!<eos> Okay, charge to 150.<eos> Get that epi on board.<eos> Bailey, we told his mother we would not resuscitate.<eos> Clear!<eos> - 200!<eos> - Bailey!<eos> His heart stopped?<eos> Yes, it did, but only just for a second, and then...
Do you have any idea what you've done?<eos> I made a mistake, Miranda.<eos> People make mistakes.<eos> Surgeons make mistakes.<eos> I don't, not like that.<eos> You made an astonishing error in judgment that I'm trying to accept and forgive.<eos> And it's gonna take me a lot longer than six months.<eos> All bleeding must stop.<eos> Well, I am sorry I disappoint you.<eos> Sometimes it does so at a cost.
Okay, uh, Courtney Hall, 23 weeks pregnant.<eos> She's post-op from a fetal laser photocoagulation to separate a shared blood vessel between two of her babies.<eos> Wow, uh, quadruplets?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what I said when I found out.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> You got it.<eos> This is for you guys.<eos> No, you did not need to do that.<eos> Yes, we did.
Dr. Karev is just trying to get some air into his lungs.<eos> She's still having contractions.<eos> Okay, uh, increase the magnesium rate.<eos> Uh, you know what?<eos> Um, I'm still confused.<eos> Take me through the deductions again.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> First, the obvious.<eos> Do you have any dependants?<eos> Uh, we do.
She's still having contractions.<eos> Okay, uh, increase the magnesium rate.<eos> Uh, you know what?<eos> Um, I'm still confused.<eos> Take me through the deductions again.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> First, the obvious.<eos> Do you have any dependants?<eos> Uh, we do.<eos> We do.
Me, too.<eos> I have a son now, too.<eos> You're just packing.<eos> Should we resuscitate?<eos> No.<eos> He's gone.<eos> He herniated.<eos> He was brain-dead minutes ago.<eos> Time of death, 18:09.<eos> Did I...
Hi!<eos> Hi!<eos> - ♪ rest your head ♪ - You paged?<eos> Um, Robbins has requested you for her service for the foreseeable future.<eos> Apparently, you're really good with the moms.<eos> Yeah, I'm not.<eos> I just did what Robbins...<eos> No, you helped that woman through the scariest hours of her life.<eos> I did, didn't I?<eos> Yes, you did.
Do you think he'll just turn the bloody crystal and all of its power over to us?<eos> He's right.<eos> Let's go get that crystal.<eos> Let's.<eos> - Where should we start?<eos> - Actually, um... I was thinking maybe you should sit this one out.<eos> Oh, that's why you were trying to be delicate with me.<eos> You're worried the Evil Queen is about to come out to play.<eos> No, I just want what's best for you.<eos> No, you don't.
The purpose of this meeting is to decide if you are worth rehabilitating or not.<eos> And if I am? Then I get you a job.<eos> And if I'm not?<eos> Then you never see me again.<eos> And the next time you have an incident, you will go to solitary confinement for a month.<eos> So I suggest you go back to your cell and you think long and hard about what you want to accomplish during your time here.<eos> I have to say, I'm glad you've decided to settle rather than fight these suits.<eos> Well, as you can see, things are a little tight around here, so you have us at a disadvantage.<eos> What I have is the fact that you don't want to be talking about having hired a fraud in court for the next six months.<eos> No, we don't, so...
Mike took one meeting with Rothman Insurance.<eos> Jack Soloff told Stemple about it. - No way.<eos> - It's all right here, Harvey.<eos> And if we don't pay him off tonight, he kills that deal tomorrow and we're out of business ten minutes later.<eos> That's blackmail. I'm not giving in to blackmail.<eos> Oh, come on, do you think I want to do this?<eos> He's got us by the balls, Harvey.<eos> If we don't pay him, what was everything we went through the other night even for?<eos> Which means right now, we just have to figure out how much we're willing to pay.<eos> No, we don't.
Bobo, I have it.<eos> That's not Peacemaker.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Waverly!<eos> Where is your sister, pretty lady?<eos> Come on, Waverly. We just wanna talk!<eos> Forget talking.<eos> Where's Wynonna?<eos> Bullshit, they do.
Bad idea! Bad idea!<eos> Listen very carefully.<eos> As we slide this plant into your chair, gradually replacing the weight of your body...<eos> Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!<eos> You're gonna Indiana Jones me here? - You bet your ass we are.<eos> - You are betting my ass, Detective.<eos> - You are literally betting my ass!<eos> - Hey, it worked in the movie.<eos> - No, it didn't!<eos> - It did for a second!
There's no answer at the Heritage Society, and Molly's not picking up her phone.<eos> Didi, get word to Cole and to Bomb Squad that we're heading to Angelino Park, 'cause that's where our bomber is.<eos> And here we have the De Rosa House built in 1887 by Randall Stringer, a land speculator and real estate developer.<eos> If you follow me inside, we'll go take a look.<eos> So as you can see, the house is just magnificent.<eos> Everyone at Heritage worked really hard to save it.<eos> What made this worth saving, hmm?<eos> I'm not... sure I understand.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> You never did.
Think about David.<eos> This is all for David.<eos> He gave me a chance when nobody else would.<eos> Where I come from, I was chemical engineer.<eos> Here, I couldn't get work as a janitor!<eos> That shop, it was my...<eos> Home.<eos> When you came to this country, you left behind the only home you'd ever known.<eos> And you had no idea how hard it would be to find a place where you felt like you belonged.<eos> But I did.
Charmain's on her way.<eos> Let Kristin take Vickery to get help.<eos> You know about the wheel of karma?<eos> Something Charlie told me about.<eos> The wheel turns and turns and some days, it just sends you up to that bright starlight, and then the next, it crushes you.<eos> No.<eos> We have a daughter.<eos> She's never done anything to anybody.<eos> She has got no bad karma coming.<eos> Your husband does.
It sounds better, a rounder figure.<eos> Thirty is a number...<eos> If you leave the firm, yes.<eos> Marcel, would you leave?<eos> -Me?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -No.<eos> -No.<eos> But I do have to leave.<eos> I do.
Buttercup has a clock in his head.<eos> He can do the course in perfect time.<eos> Don't forget how he runs across the pasture whenever he sees me.<eos> He's an angel on this earth.<eos> And he moves like a cat.<eos> The way he transitions into a canter, it's like...<eos> like... Floating on air!<eos> Dr. McCord.<eos> I did not realize you knew where my office was.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You don't have to be a psychotherapist to figure out why she shut down.<eos> What if she's not working with us because she's with them?<eos> Politically and emotionally.<eos> I doubt she has the sophistication<eos> - to run a game that deep.<eos> - All the same, maybe it's time to start treating her like an enemy combatant, and less like our nation's favorite houseguest.<eos> You want to take a terrified young woman to a black site for enhanced interrogation.<eos> - Yeah, hello. - That's a good idea.<eos> Whatever works, right?<eos> - Okay. - 'Cause this approach does not.
Oh, come on, Chuck, man. I brought you here to break your funk, not to see you sink deeper into it.<eos> Yeah, Buffalo and New Orleans ain't calling me with no huge contract.<eos> - You got options, brother.<eos> - And so do you.<eos> Option number one is going over there and telling Siefert he's a piece of shit for cutting you like he did.<eos> That ain't me.<eos> Well, sometimes we got to do things we don't want to do.<eos> Like you think I wanted to go on that stage and put myself on display like a piece of meat?<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah, I do.<eos> No, I did not.
I've run a successful construction business for ten years.<eos> Lieutenant Casey has not missed a beat since the campaign began, Chief.<eos> - No? - No.<eos> I've reviewed 51's company journal.<eos> How many shifts would you say that you switched or stepped out on since starting your campaign?<eos> Too many.<eos> But the campaign events are done with.<eos> It's not gonna be a problem going forward.<eos> I'm holding you to that.<eos> Please do.
- Mmm. - Told you.<eos> So, how did Grant's band break up?<eos> Okay, so Grant's drummer got caught sleeping with the bass player's fiancé.<eos> And... I sound just like Grant.<eos> They didn't make it.<eos> Like 99% of all the other bands.<eos> You think he'll ever change?<eos> He doesn't have to change.<eos> He just has to grow up.<eos> I did.
But you can't talk to them.<eos> You know what they'll say?<eos> They'll say you went crazy 'cause Eli was stepping out behind your back.<eos> They'll know that he didn't want to have kids.<eos> They'll say that you snapped Courtney's neck because you couldn't handle being a mother, and then what?<eos> Look at all those parents whose kids disappeared.<eos> They spend years in court trying to clear their name.<eos> How did you know Courtney's neck was snapped?<eos> Well, you told me.<eos> No, I didn't.
Um, or he figured it out.<eos> No, I mean, I-I told Karev.<eos> I just asked him to keep it to himself. What, keep it to himself?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> That I'm seeing people. That I'm dating.<eos> That I went on a date.<eos> So, April knows, huh?<eos> Uh, that you're seeing other people.<eos> - Does April know? - No!<eos> N... She doesn't.
- I don't know. I heard he's pretty gassy.<eos> - Oh, you found your audience.<eos> - It's your birthday?<eos> Happy birthday!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Oh, you should come to her birthday tomorrow.<eos> - Oh, I would love to!<eos> Wait, how do I get there?<eos> - Do you have a car?<eos> - I do!
Let me just text Nancy really quick to see if...<eos> - you know what?<eos> Please, come in.<eos> Make yourself at home.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Ooh, jell-o shots.<eos> All right.<eos> You know, I am starving.<eos> - How's it going? - Excuse me.<eos> - How you doing?
Made it real easy.<eos> He'll be city lock-up.<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.<eos> You have the right to an attorney and to have an attorney present during questioning.<eos> If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.<eos> Do you understand these rights as I have read them to you? Yes.<eos> You were just gonna lie to everyone?<eos> Did you know about Karev? No!<eos> I didn't.
What?<eos> You think I'm keeping my job or my medical license?<eos> We don't know what's going to happen.<eos> I'll tell you what isn't gonna happen.<eos> Me ever setting foot in that hospital again.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Why?<eos> You didn't punch the guy.<eos> But I told Bailey.<eos> You did?
It should be okay to remove the sensor.<eos> It's over.<eos> Let's get you both out of here.<eos> Let's get you up the ladder.<eos> Let's get you out.<eos> I see movement in that window.<eos> Get those people out of there.<eos> Life is nothing compared to heaven.<eos> We have no choice now.<eos> Of course you do.
You know the prophet, alayhi as-salam. said a person who commits suicide is doomed to all eternity to repeat his death over and over.<eos> Don't listen to him!<eos> Americans lie.<eos> Sam, using images from your body cam and their entrance visas, we've matched three...<eos> Make that four.<eos> Sorry, four children, using their birthdays, to the same clinic where Nadir was born.<eos> Means they have parents.<eos> Use it.<eos> You have a family out there.<eos> No, we don't.
Perhaps they could use some help, Mr. Hanna.<eos> Wouldn't do to have something untoward happen to him on our watch.<eos> They're pretty closed to outsiders.<eos> In the minibar in your room, is a water bottle with a green label on it.<eos> It contains an odorless, tasteless syrup of ipecac.<eos> Doesn't that cause violent vomiting?<eos> Well, for a short period.<eos> But it's harmless.<eos> Hetty, one of us could have opened that.<eos> But you didn't, did you?
No, no, no.<eos> It's not all good.<eos> I almost stuck a thermometer in his liver.<eos> Uh, so is he stable?<eos> Well, I'm still running tests, but he seems completely healthy despite having ingested a deadly dose of tetrodotoxin.<eos> Hm?<eos> TTX. It's a neurotoxin found in several species of fish.<eos> It's extremely potent.<eos> And yet he survived, so do you have an explanation.<eos> No, but your husband sure does.
- Which means...<eos> Someone at Zantium Labs is trying to kill me!<eos> Someone at Zantium Labs is trying to kill you!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Is that what we sound like?<eos> Certainly hope not.<eos> I mean, it was cute but just overly cute.<eos> Alan. Huh?<eos> Do you know who ordered the L.A.H. for Zantium?<eos> I do.
Not unless I want to stuff my pants with<eos> Andrew Jackson's face. So you're lugging around money?<eos> Yeah, it's my life's savings.<eos> Every penny of it.<eos> Kelly, my girlfriend, she didn't trust banks in the best of times, let alone during the animal apocalypse.<eos> So, uh, why carry it around with you? Why don't you just - leave it at home?<eos> - We had some wolves get into our apartment in Halifax.<eos> It was bad.<eos> I got out.<eos> But Kelly didn't.
That's what the gun's for. That's it.<eos> And call me nuts, Jamie, but I would think me having a gun would be a good thing to you.<eos> I mean, unless you're gonna defend yourself with your one good foot.<eos> Can we please go back to the cabin?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> - When you give me the gun.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah, really.<eos> Do you realize how crazy this sounds?<eos> Yes, I do.
He's waiting for me.<eos> Just doesn't make any sense, though, one minute he's trying to kill you, the next, what... guy wants to have a beer and a crossword party?<eos> - Get behind the wheel. - Whoa, whoa, hey.<eos> - You're not going in there.<eos> - What else should I do?<eos> We sit here, we wait for him to come out, we stuff him into a bag and we throw him off the Taylor Bridge.<eos> Ah, it's not going to be that easy with this guy.<eos> Why?<eos> Worked for Rasputin.<eos> Actually, it didn't.
He knows we won't do anything with humans around.<eos> That's it?<eos> He's a liability to all of us, he needs to be put down before he kills anyone else.<eos> More bodies to bury.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - The coordinates for where I laid Karen Morgan's body to rest.<eos> For Jeremy.<eos> He wants to visit her grave.<eos> Jeremy appreciates everything you do to protect us.<eos> We all do.
It's got to be something else.<eos> Okay, so, uh, in the-in the basement, there were the photos of all of us.<eos> No, no, I'm not buying that, all right?<eos> The photos, they're just a smokescreen.<eos> Well, I agree.<eos> Everything else points to Dr. Brennan.<eos> The way the victim was clothed.<eos> The way her hair was cut.<eos> The question is, how does killing Melissa get him closer to Bones?<eos> Well, it doesn't.
I mean, we were having a healthy debate between a husband and wife.<eos> Right, sometimes our debates are so "healthy," I end up sleeping on the couch.<eos> It's true.<eos> Mynameis Dr. Temperance Brennan, and I am a forensic anthropologist with the Jeffersonian Institution.<eos> And my name is Seeley Booth, and I'm a special agent with the FBI's homicide division.<eos> When I'm called out to a scene where the remains are badly burnt or decomposed, I call in Bones.<eos> He calls me "Bones." Mm-hmm.<eos> Even though I'm his wife and the mother of two of his children, he still refers to me by a nickname I despise.<eos> Well, you used to despise it, but now I think you like it.<eos> No, I don't.
Booth has formed a connection with the victim's father because he, too, has an addiction to gambling.<eos> It's... it's a struggle Booth knows all too well.<eos> And because Booth can now see himself in the victim's father, he no longer feels the man would be capable of killing his own son.<eos> This is why I trust science over heart.<eos> Science cannot be swayed.<eos> And right now the science is saying my husband is wrong.<eos> The victim's father mentioned, uh, owing money to a bookie.<eos> I mean, if that bookie really wanted his money, I mean, there's a possibility he may have gone after the guy's son.<eos> Your wife thinks you're wasting time on the bookie.<eos> Of course she does.
... then I will have him swab the fracture.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Am I, uh, interrupting a date?<eos> Maybe a drug deal?<eos> Excuse me for a minute.<eos> Yeah, just a minute.<eos> Or maybe five to ten years.<eos> So... you aren't a groupie at all, are you?<eos> I never said I was.<eos> You did.
Girl, this is a compilation of the top ten local RB bands.<eos> All you need to do is pick which one you like best.<eos> I have never seen you this organized.<eos> Honey, I know that the last thing you want is to spend the next year having everybody fussing over you.<eos> Now reach in the back and grab that binder.<eos> ♪ Oh, baby... ♪ What is all this?<eos> Locations, caterers, florists, honeymoon ideas.<eos> All you need to do is kick back and fill in the checklist.<eos> Okay. I thought you said you wanted to make this quick so you could get back to your case.<eos> I do.
So you flew halfway around the world to tell her your suspicions.<eos> I knew that she could not look me in the eye and not know that I was speaking the truth.<eos> All right, let's pretend you are telling the truth.<eos> All right, you dropped this bombshell on her, she confronts her husband, he kills her.<eos> Either way, there's still blood on your hands.<eos> Don't you think I realize that?<eos> This man has money and power.<eos> And in my experience, people with money and power will do anything to keep it.<eos> Why would I trust you?<eos> Hmm? Your boss didn't.
You were either in the store with her or you were just her source. No.<eos> Either way, you're an accessory to murder.<eos> Or maybe you killed her yourself.<eos> Why on earth would I do that?<eos> Because you were having an affair with her.<eos> I'm afraid you are mistaken.<eos> Well, here's what I'm not mistaken about.<eos> The thief working with her was six-foot-two, athletic build, and knew exactly when the Topkapi Dagger was gonna show up.<eos> Does that sound like anybody you know?<eos> Maybe it does.
Please tell me there's not a third.<eos> Actually, Mr. Eichorn, we're here to speak with Al Baxter.<eos> Is he around?<eos> No, he's... working from home.<eos> You hesitated.<eos> "Working from home" is usually code for "too hungover to come into the office."<eos> Why do you want to talk to him?<eos> God hates the Midnight Ranger.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> He just does.
And when the chips fall, it's important you know who your friends are.<eos> Is that clear enough?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> Stop the cart.<eos> What's down there?<eos> Uh... just an old bunker...<eos> I want to see it.<eos> I don't have any keys.<eos> We do.
Why'd you really bail on me last time?<eos> Yeah, I guess I gotta clear that up.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> Usually, when I meet a woman, she sees the chair right away, and I can tell from the look in her eye whether she's okay with it or not.<eos> But we met on the phone.<eos> Which is why... I couldn't bear the idea of you seeing me and giving me that look.<eos> Like the woman behind you is giving me right now.<eos> Don't turn around.<eos> - No, don't...
So?<eos> She caught him cheating on her, and then he cheated on that girl, too.<eos> So he's a player.<eos> Apparently.<eos> (sighs heavily) That's a shame.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> What do you mean, what is she going to do?<eos> She has to tell Bonnie.<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> - I don't?
Have you always lived on the sappy side, or did that come out when you became a mother?<eos> The only reason you warned Agent Hotchner about this storm is because your son had something to do with it.<eos> And now you need our help.<eos> Not as much as you need mine.<eos> Your son framed a federal agent and manipulated special weapons and tactics operatives to do it.<eos> So, here's the thing about SWAT.<eos> They don't like being manipulated.<eos> So now your son is on a shoot first, ask questions later list.<eos> I want him taken into custody, alive.<eos> Of course you do.
What do you mean by that?<eos> He started rambling about how I killed his team, which I expected.<eos> But then...<eos> He started to laugh...<eos> Like he was delighted.<eos> And I'll be honest with you, in that moment, I was scared... Of him.<eos> Of what he could do to his own team.<eos> Or his own son, for that matter.<eos> I was scared-- why would you believe anything he says?<eos> We didn't.
Ok, warden, we're 5 minutes out.<eos> Guys, the swatting, the reference to Asher-- this is exactly the larger plan we profiled.<eos> It worked.<eos> Rawdon has another group he's been working from the inside.<eos> By the time we clear Hotch, they'll be gone.<eos> Who's Eric Rawdon?<eos> He's behind this.<eos> Maybe he's your partner.<eos> If that were true, you'd have evidence.<eos> I do.
Don't remind me.<eos> Retirement isn't all it's cracked up to be.<eos> I was hoping I could help out around the office.<eos> Listen...<eos> I'm sure you'll find something.<eos> It doesn't have to be work.<eos> What about that flyer we saw in the lobby of your building.<eos> Something about water aerobics at the senior center?<eos> You promised you'd try that.<eos> Oh, I did.
Guy...<eos> Guy Giordano is your father?<eos> Was.<eos> Why didn't you tell me when I played you the recording?<eos> - Why didn't you say something?<eos> - Because I was trying to protect him.<eos> And I couldn't.<eos> I'm so, so sorry that you had to go through something like this.<eos> You know, I- - I know what it's like to lose a parent.<eos> - I really do.
There's a rougher side to Patrick's business that you may not know about.<eos> I kind of do know about that.<eos> I also know he's passionate about restaurants.<eos> Pilar, he's a criminal.<eos> Just... you should stay away from him.<eos> I'm telling you, there's more to him than you know.<eos> He could do more for us.<eos> - I think it'd be good for both of you.<eos> - Okay, you really don't know what you're talking about right now.<eos> I do.
Okay?<eos> You're doing great, you know.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Go, study, multiply.<eos> Yes, boss lady.<eos> Look, Jon, I know you've become close to the family.<eos> It's not about that, Bernie.<eos> We all want our clients to be exonerated.<eos> Of course we do.
Like I've said, you're one smart gal.<eos> Thank you, Teddy.<eos> Have you ordered?<eos> Nah, I was just waiting on you.<eos> I hope you haven't been here too long.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be.<eos> I got nowhere to go.<eos> Free as a lark.<eos> But I do.
He lives in Arizona.<eos> Arizona?<eos> Is... Is there any other family nearby?<eos> My wife was barren.<eos> Wasn't her fault.<eos> Just was.<eos> Well, what about neighbors or friends?<eos> Could they go get it for you?<eos> We had a falling out.<eos> Who did?
I hope you weren't waiting up for me.<eos> Your father never really liked the tire business.<eos> Okay.<eos> I mean, it wasn't in his blood or anything like that.<eos> But why would anyone have tires in their blood... stinky tires, for God's sake?<eos> It was just a business he could support his family with.<eos> Your dad was in the family business.<eos> What brought all of this on?<eos> I didn't want you to come back here to be my de facto psychiatrist.<eos> I really didn't, Amantha.
That's about 90 miles away.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cost of gas and $100.<eos> Throw in lunch?<eos> Sure.<eos> Let's roll.<eos> Name's Ted.<eos> Dog.<eos> Did you say "Dog"?<eos> I did.
The rest is embedded in his quadriceps.<eos> What, the phone was inside his leg?<eos> It was in his pants pocket.<eos> It shattered when the car crashed, and the pieces, I say, embedded in his thigh.<eos> Well, so much for getting those contacts.<eos> I think it's safe to say that his last contact was with the pole.<eos> I made a joke.<eos> Wow. You cut the car in half.<eos> No.<eos> The firefighters did.
So it's the chemical composition for vinyl.<eos> What's made out of vinyl?<eos> Records?<eos> Bumper stickers.<eos> Oh. I bet this shred scraped off when the two cars collided.<eos> Can you tell me what the bumper sticker says?<eos> Based on a shred that's 3.2 millimeters long?<eos> No.<eos> Ooh, you have something else, don't you?<eos> I do.
Leah Ramsey-- that's not her real name.<eos> 18 Leah Ramseys have Social Security numbers in the United States.<eos> Not one matches her age and description.<eos> Does she have a phone, DiNozzo?<eos> Look, she gave me her e-mail, which I threw away, because I never intended to see her again.<eos> Well, how did you contact her the first time?<eos> I met her at a bar.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> She approached you.<eos> Well, they usually do, but I...
I needed another set of eyes.<eos> Of course.<eos> It's an honor.<eos> I haven't been to the inner sanctum in a while.<eos> Welcome back to Casa DiNozzo.<eos> I wish it was under better circumstances.<eos> And I get to say hello to Kate and Ziva in their cute little bowl.<eos> Yeah, Ziva's gained a little weight.<eos> You can drop by anytime.<eos> Senior does.
This is Emma.<eos> Maggie's daughter, right?<eos> Hey, there.<eos> Hi.<eos> Uh, can I talk to you outside for a second?<eos> - They seem interesting.<eos> - That's one word for it.<eos> I can't believe you're leaving.<eos> - Your mom came by and talked to Tina.<eos> - Did she?
That's what I came here to tell you.<eos> - You're back on the book?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I convinced Jillian that I'd be able to prep the manuscript faster than anyone else, and she agreed.<eos> You're gonna edit the book?<eos> More that I'll be a kind of creative gatekeeper.<eos> Make sure everything goes well and everybody stays reasonably happy.<eos> Do we have a problem?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Do we?
- You're disturbing her.<eos> - And what about what she wants?<eos> If you keep pushing I promise it'll be detrimental to her health.<eos> God, what's taking her so long?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I never should've agreed to marry them.<eos> Ali never should've agreed to marry him.<eos> I mean, they only dated for one week.<eos> We know nothing about him.<eos> Yeah, well, apparently, neither did she.
27 years before that, another 8 disappeared.<eos> All within the same time frame?<eos> Couple days?<eos> Same time of year, too.<eos> And how far back do the disappearances go?<eos> That's it.<eos> The town's only been here since the '50s.<eos> It was all virgin forest till they found coal here.<eos> So then how do people explain the missing?<eos> Mostly they don't.
Get off me. Get off!<eos> Women and children, huh? Huh? !<eos> You did it, didn't you? ! You did it!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about!<eos> I want to stay.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, Bendek.<eos> That's out of the question.<eos> Linda doesn't know, does she?<eos> That you're leaving?<eos> Yes, she does.
You killed my brother.<eos> - I didn't.
No?<eos> Liz Harper, Benjamin Williams,<eos> Grace Gibson, Beth Bacan,<eos> May.<eos> I don't think it's him.<eos> Well, we've got his DNA, there's evidence at his house, and he hasn't got any alibis.<eos> Our man is a methodical cold-blooded killer.<eos> Yann doesn't fit that profile.<eos> - He could have faked the panic attack.<eos> - He didn't.
Nothing.<eos> The DNA from his hair was in the hand of a murder victim.<eos> I know.<eos> Have you got the forensic report?<eos> Uh... Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're saying Andrew Barnes was murdered?<eos> It seems like it, yes.<eos> That's terrible, but what's it got to do with us?<eos> You did business with him?
Do you think we can use it against Amara?<eos> What is this?<eos> The Rod of Aaron.<eos> A Hand of God.<eos> If we're gonna fight her, what better way to arm up than with an actual dose of His power?<eos> It's kicked.<eos> You're out of juice, huh?<eos> We've got jack on another Hand of God, and we've got even less jack on how to save Cass.<eos> If he wants to be saved.<eos> He does.
You're right.<eos> You're actually handy to have around.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Lovely of you to say.<eos> Crowley, ticktock.<eos> You with us?<eos> The crux of your dispute is your contention that Lucifer, and only Lucifer, can use the Horn to beat Amara, right?<eos> You got it.<eos> Well, that scenario only works if you actually possess said Horn, which you do not.<eos> No, we don't.
Guys.<eos> Look at this.<eos> I hate this.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And, by the way, where the hell is Crowley?<eos> I mean, we're essentially all set up.<eos> Yeah, I mean, he's the one that boxed us into doing this.<eos> You'd think he'd have the decency to --<eos> Show up?<eos> He does.
- Yeah, sure. Let's do the cake.<eos> Okay, I've been on Mutiny asking around, trying to figure out what I could about this SwapMeet.<eos> - From what I can tell, it sounds seriously less robust than what we have in mind for Exchange.<eos> Plus, it's focused on sports memorabilia, so I just can't see it reaching anywhere near the size and scope of our user base.<eos> Hey, sure was weird that Jennifer came to the party, wasn't it?<eos> We will not lose to an inferior product.<eos> - I refuse to be Betamax.<eos> - 'Cause I don't remember inviting her.<eos> Oh, no, we didn't.<eos> Joanie did that all on her own.
- Wait, he just said 400.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> My mistake. - 325, how's that sound?<eos> We just saved you $250,000. I'd think you'd be happier.<eos> I am happy, very.<eos> I'm just a little surprised by how completely off-book you went.<eos> I thought this was supposed to be handshakes and how do you dos.<eos> You see an opportunity, you take it. That's the sport of it.<eos> It could have gone the other way.<eos> But it didn't.
Well, it's better than screaming.<eos> I've heard quiet make you beg for screaming.<eos> - Put that there.<eos> I want to apologize for my outburst yesterday.<eos> It was totally inappropriate. And it shouldn't have happened.<eos> So if I made anyone feel uncomfortable, then I'm sorry.<eos> Well, that little speech made me very uncomfortable.<eos> - I'm kidding.<eos> - It never happened.<eos> - What? - It so clearly did.
- What? - It so clearly did.<eos> - It's a thing you say.<eos> Okay, look, we don't have to discuss this ad nauseam, but we thought saying nothing seemed equally stupid.<eos> So we're saying something.<eos> We are aware that bringing a marriage into the workplace is complicated and we're doing the best we can, okay?<eos> Now, can we try to get back to where we were?<eos> Okay, great. The big Ryan-shaped hole.<eos> Did you find any prospects last night?<eos> No, but I decided we don't need anyone.<eos> - Of course we do.
I was gonna say lovely.<eos> My date just cancelled and I have a plus one.<eos> I could check with Gordon, see if he could watch the girls tonight.<eos> No, um... I was thinking about John Bosworth.<eos> Oh. I mean... really?<eos> You know, there'll be a whole slew of Valley big shots there.<eos> It's a great opportunity for John to make some business connections.<eos> Sure.<eos> But... nobody calls him John.<eos> I do.
Your honor.<eos> Listen, the Green Arrow is not coming.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> Just for the fun of it, how is it that you know so much about Mr. Arrow?<eos> I have it on pretty good authority that he's tied up right now.<eos> Are you his buddy?<eos> I have connections, and I--listen.<eos> You let these people go, and I'll make something happen.<eos> Do we have a deal?<eos> No, we most certainly do not.
So I told him if he got a good review in the Times, my life rights were his.<eos> But he had contact with you before the show premiered.<eos> He wanted to meet again.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He said it had to do with the movie, but I could smell his, uh, desperation through the phone, especially when I said no.<eos> And later that night, he was dead.<eos> Pero Mira.<eos> I didn't bring you all the way out here to talk about Los muertos.<eos> You didn't?
What is going on In Abuddin makes it even more important for us To put the pressure on.<eos> This American is not going to be President forever, and before he steps aside,<eos> We need to encourage him to make a war he's going to regret.<eos> Your plan for Al-Qadi Backfired.<eos> Instead of making the American more powerful, It created an alliance against him.<eos> Now you want us to rush into war Because you see your window of opportunity closing?<eos> The Sheik chose Ihab,<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> If he were alive, I know what side he'd be on.<eos> We all do.
The court handed down its sentence.<eos> Is he going to be executed?<eos> In three days.<eos> They'll let me see him once before.<eos> You should go. Say your good-byes.<eos> Say good-bye for me, too.<eos> You hate him.<eos> I don't hate Wafiq.<eos> Then you hate me for loving him.<eos> No, I don't. I...
I had to put a target on your back and make sure you wouldn't capitulate to the authorities, but you didn't.<eos> Wesley, you murdered people.<eos> You killed Bryce.<eos> You're damn right I did!<eos> He and Her Majesty's Kingdom abandoned me, so they had to be punished.<eos> Which is why you sent our worm to plunge London into darkness.<eos> Oh, Wes, your captors drove you mad.<eos> How can you of all people say that to me?<eos> They had it coming.<eos> They all did.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...<eos> I have a family, Matt.<eos> So did I.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...<eos> I have a family, Matt.<eos> So did I.<eos> And a girlfriend and a life.<eos> And now I don't.
So go to her.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't give up.<eos> I'm not asking you to give up.<eos> I need to make sure that she doesn't.<eos> Thanks for getting back to me.<eos> I'll admit, I was surprised to see you on my phone sheet.<eos> Is there something I can do for you, Damon?<eos> I have a rather lengthy list of hell stone rejects that I need killed posthaste, and I hear you have the resources to do it.<eos> I do.
All the deaths that were covered up as animal attacks.<eos> The more I dug, the less sense it made.<eos> So what did you find?<eos> That there was at least one vampire in Mystic Falls the night Penny died.<eos> It was you.<eos> Yeah, I was there.<eos> I came back for the anniversary of the sheriff's death.<eos> I knew it'd be a hard day for Caroline, and I thought there would be a good chance she'd show up, and if she did, I wanted to be there for her.<eos> But she didn't show, did she?<eos> No, she never did.
Rayna screwed us.<eos> She failed to mention that by giving Bonnie her life, she was actually giving Bonnie her lifestyle.<eos> So now when Bonnie wakes up, she's gonna be Rayna 2.0.<eos> And does that gift begin with a very long nap?<eos> I didn't get a chance to ask as she burst into flames. And before you ask, no, I did not get a chance to interrogate her little shaman friend, because he vanished at the same time.<eos> Damon, did the spell work or not?<eos> ! I don't know, Enzo.<eos> I have no idea why she's not waking up.<eos> I mean, the least she could do to thank us for saving her life is just open her eyes, let us know whether or not she wants to murder us.<eos> What if she doesn't?
Damon... Hello?<eos> Hang on.<eos> What did you just say?<eos> I can hear her in the vault.<eos> Damon. Elena is in a warehouse in Brooklyn.<eos> I know, but...<eos> Damon, help me.<eos> What if something happened to her?<eos> What if the Armory took her?<eos> They didn't.
We don't have the algorithm yet!<eos> Walter, I need your answer.<eos> Toby, do we have this?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Sly?<eos> I'm searching!<eos> Mr. O'Brien?<eos> Ah! Look what I found!<eos> Does this help?<eos> Sure does!
- Yeah, I shot you!<eos> - I didn't do anything!<eos> - You shot my partner!<eos> - I didn't do anything!<eos> - You mother... what the hell did you do?<eos> - What the hell did you do?<eos> - You shot me!<eos> What is your problem?<eos> Stay down! What are you doing?<eos> I didn't do anything!
Feed you the info as I get it.<eos> I appreciate that, but because of the profile of the incident, we'll be doing a parallel and independent investigation.<eos> My people are already talking to the victim.<eos> This is a clean shoot, Peter.<eos> I sure hope so.<eos> You get me those reports ASAP.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Ellis?<eos> I'm Detective Halstead, this is Detective Lindsay.<eos> They're saying Michael shot the police.<eos> Yeah, he did.
I mean, heck, if Blake Shelton wants to teach you how to sing, you don't go with Shakira, right?<eos> Well, for what it's worth, Coach is crazy.<eos> I mean, who knows more about getting Garrison to State than Colt Bennett?<eos> I guess you haven't heard about the new Colt Bennett.<eos> You know, I'm driving.<eos> Yeah, I have.<eos> Josh, you know, he's just another read-option clone.<eos> I mean, he can hit the short crosses and extend plays with his feet, but he stares down his primary receiver and that is just begging to be intercepted.<eos> Okay, now I'm offended they didn't ask you to be the new coach.<eos> Well, actually, they did.
Hey, hey. If they ask, she's 21, all right?<eos> Everybody put your hands in the air... and wave 'em like you just don't care!<eos> The hell?<eos> - What up, boys?<eos> - Beer Pong!<eos> - He's cute.<eos> - Hey, how we doing, boss?<eos> Nikki has a thing for cops.<eos> It's true.<eos> I do.
Seriously?<eos> That's your response to this whole thing?<eos> You know what?<eos> I came here to have a good time and that's what I'm going to do.<eos> You can do whatever you want.<eos> I'm going to put on that robe, have a glass of wine, turn on those Jacuzzi jets, and have myself a good old time.<eos> Now I get it.<eos> It's so I don't jump.<eos> Who wants to do a shot... from my mouth?<eos> I do.
All right, Roth girls, y'all have a good day.<eos> Hey... what did you do?<eos> Colt... it would be unsavory to give you the details of the things I did to your girlfriend's mom last night.<eos> You cannot date Heather's mom!<eos> Are you intentionally trying to fuck up my life?<eos> You don't need my help to fuck up your life.<eos> Who does that?<eos> I mean, I was cool with you going out with her sister, but you don't bang the mom, dude.<eos> Hey, I like the mom, dude.<eos> No, you don't.
You know why?<eos> They didn't have a TV!<eos> Look, we can't afford to keep the calves.<eos> We can't even afford to keep the lights on.<eos> What are we gonna do for the winter, huh?<eos> I mean... me and you, we can eat Colt.<eos> What are the cows gonna eat?<eos> I didn't work my ass off all year, so I could go in the hole.<eos> We can hold on a little while, things will turn.<eos> And what if they don't?
He is a very gifted liar.<eos> Took me many years to find that out.<eos> Those poor voters, they never stood a chance.<eos> Anyway, gentlemen, we're here to discuss business, so I'd like to start now.<eos> I'm sure you're all aware that ever since I left, profits have dropped 15%.<eos> I made a deal with Jimenez.<eos> I gave them a piece of my Dallas operation, and in return, they will move our product.<eos> In addition to that, I want to regain market share, and in order to do so, I need to increase shipment by 30% a month.<eos> We don't have the infrastructure to move that amount.<eos> Ah, but we do now.
So glad you talked me into this.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> This is Matt Casey.<eos> I'm looking for an Alderman Dooley.<eos> So when the alarm comes in, you just tap right there and that lets the alarm office know that the company is responding. It's pretty straightforward.<eos> And pretty boring, so try not to fall asleep.<eos> Well, I don't think I'll ever sleep again, so it shouldn't be a problem.<eos> Sooner or later, this guy's gonna come up for air, and the cops'll be there. Yeah.<eos> Thanks for having my back.<eos> The whole house does.
A conspiracy theory?<eos> That's why we're all here?<eos> Excuse me, Master Bruce.<eos> Pardon me, sir, might I have your name, please?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your name... please, sir.<eos> Crowley.<eos> Mr. Crowley, did your parents ever teach you any manners?<eos> I don't have to listen to this.<eos> Oh, but you do, sir!
- Had a kid Odell's age.<eos> Didn't want to risk her identifying with him.<eos> - Used a preempt.<eos> - Mm. You didn't preempt Keith Johnson.<eos> He had a 17-year-old child, as well, but he was white.<eos> Are you reading my notes?<eos> White jurors are more likely to incarcerate black defendants.<eos> Tess.<eos> ADA Bonotto knows the stats on jury diversity.<eos> We all do.
I know, and there's no excuse for that.<eos> He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn't shown him any physical affection for years.<eos> I was wrong, there's three excuses for that.<eos> Oh, my God, it's working.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Look.<eos> The system is maintaining its own stability. The quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.<eos> You're right.<eos> You realize what this means? Yeah.<eos> I do.
Hang on!<eos> So, after your husband passed, you never remarried?<eos> No. Just focused on work and the church.<eos> Ah!<eos> And what do you do? I work at the church.<eos> Well, they're lucky to have you.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Do you realize what's happening here?<eos> Yeah, I do.
'Cause I didn't understand anything after "fan of your work."<eos> I always wondered where all the Avengers' enemies came from.<eos> That android this morning?<eos> It had your signature all over it.<eos> Not our style.<eos> We're not into faking things for TV.<eos> But your "heroic" group sure came out of nowhere to find fame and fortune by flashing around some pretty cool powers.<eos> Stolen powers, based on my scans.<eos> Do you know what you can do with your scans?<eos> [laughs] Yeah, I do.
And our next version...<eos> Oh, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry. Our?<eos> No, no. You must mean Bill and I because I... I don't see why we would...<eos> Forget about trams, cars, trains.<eos> This is like nothing else.<eos> I'm... I'm... I'm still shaking.<eos> I rode it until it ran dry twice.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> It didn't.
I love the motorcycle that we built, but this, this is less of a risk.<eos> There he is.<eos> I'm Cecil Mason.<eos> - This is my brother...<eos> - Mason Gears.<eos> These are your new friends?<eos> Is there a problem with that?<eos> Not if there's no conflict of interest.<eos> We didn't know you had a contract with Bill.<eos> We don't.
Well, we're not entirely sure that's what happened.<eos> There's a good chance that, uh, both men were killed by the same person.<eos> No.<eos> Nope, I've never seen this man before.<eos> Um... is this Jared's desk?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A few deals went belly-up last year.<eos> We could barely afford a real office, so about, uh, six months ago, my house became our headquarters.<eos> Something like that can put a lot of stress on a partnership.<eos> Yeah, it did.
You're doing a great job.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't forget to vote.<eos> - Ladies. - I'm voting for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't forget.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Our neighborhood needs to change.<eos> Of course it does.
Pretty much.<eos> Everybody kind of scattered when the cops showed at the park, but we all ended up at the same place.<eos> Looks like you found your path.<eos> In here, every decision is made for you.<eos> Faith is one choice I could still make, so I did.<eos> Once you got back to the station, then what happened?<eos> Until my first night in here, that was the most scared I've ever been in my life.<eos> They kept saying...<eos> Tell us the truth, Seamus.<eos> I did.
Yeah, but I had already spoken to Vishwa, we'll<eos> Falak, where is that ***** Minal, I want her to apologise.<eos> Peflod!<eos> Rajvir, please...<eos> Please don't talk like that.<eos> Look...don't lecture me on morality.<eos> Get that ***** on the line, now!<eos> Don't you get it ...<eos> I don't have a problem with you.<eos> But I do!
One drink - Huh!<eos> At the restaurant.<eos> And one<eos> - One?<eos> In the room<eos> - Yes.<eos> Out in the restaurant you struck an obscene conversation with Rajvir to which the manager is a witness.<eos> What was that about?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> You don't?
Did he force you?<eos> No. he didn't force me.<eos> He didn't pay me.<eos> We liked each other.<eos> We did it because we wanted to.<eos> Right.<eos> After that, your close acquaintances which also includes Vishwa, testified before the police that you have had other relationships.<eos> Did you have 'sexual relations' with all of them?<eos> Some of them<eos> - So you did.
No. he didn't force me.<eos> He didn't pay me.<eos> We liked each other.<eos> We did it because we wanted to.<eos> Right.<eos> After that, your close acquaintances which also includes Vishwa, testified before the police that you have had other relationships.<eos> Did you have 'sexual relations' with all of them?<eos> Some of them<eos> - So you did.<eos> You did.
That on the night of March the first this is exactly what Rajvir Singh and his friends would have naturally presumed about you.<eos> That you are fairly promiscuous and it wouldn't really matter to you if you went to bed with one more guy.<eos> I understand that they are not mature enough to understand that whenever it happened before - happened with your consent.<eos> Without any money being involved, without any coercion.<eos> But the prosecution has proved that you're a woman of questionable character.<eos> And since you were a woman of questionable character in the eyes of the accused Rajvir Singh and his friends on that day, at that moment, what did you do to make it clear that right now I am not interested in sex?<eos> What did you say?<eos> I refused<eos> - What did you say?<eos> What exactly did you do?
Answer the question.<eos> I know all about your mistakes.<eos> You took money<eos> - Objection, your honor.<eos> You want to humiliate me like Minal.<eos> Answer my question!<eos> Did you take money?<eos> Did you demand money?<eos> You want to humiliate me publicly just to prove that we took money.<eos> You did!
You took money<eos> - Objection, your honor.<eos> You want to humiliate me like Minal.<eos> Answer my question!<eos> Did you take money?<eos> Did you demand money?<eos> You want to humiliate me publicly just to prove that we took money.<eos> You did!<eos> You did take money!<eos> Of course you did.
His clients have admitted to solici... -Alright, sit down.<eos> Carry on, Mr. Deepak.<eos> Okay, let me ask you another question?<eos> . Once you saw that Minal is making a drink for herself Didn't you feel that she might be one of 'those' girls and you should leave!<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> Do women in your family drink alcohol?<eos> Only the men drink.<eos> Your mother?<eos> Your sister? Do they drink?<eos> Women from good family don't!
New high score!<eos> What is happening in there?<eos> Another statistical improbability.<eos> So... call me?<eos> I will... call you.<eos> Yes. Okay.<eos> That was interesting.<eos> I'm hungry. Are there any egg bagels left?<eos> Did she come by for a date? Yes.<eos> Yeah, she did.
The imam's wife has pictures of her children everywhere in her house, but not a single one of her husband.<eos> Maybe, like my mom, Kadisha couldn't stand looking at his face anymore.<eos> She visited the mosque 23 times in the month prior to the bombing.<eos> And how many of those times did she carry a bag big enough to hold a three-ring binder?<eos> Only once.<eos> And what day was that?<eos> September 11, 2011.<eos> The day of the bombing.<eos> We need to find that bag.<eos> Yes, we do.
Do you have the authorization? When Penny submitted her case to the CIU, she gave us access to all her defense materials and waived client confidentiality.<eos> My work up of Owen Price's case.<eos> The ER docs pumped 260 milliliters of soy sauce from his stomach, enough to cause fatal salt poisoning, if he'd had the time to metabolize it.<eos> So the soy sauce didn't kill Owen? Well, I understand why the M.E. would come to that conclusion, but Owen also had a blood glucose of zero.<eos> I believe that's what caused the seizures and eventually his death.<eos> Why didn't the defense bring this up at trial?<eos> If you found an alternative cause of death, why didn't you disclose it?<eos> Could this have cleared Penny?<eos> Tess. My contract with the defense forbade me from revealing any findings, and the defense had no obligation to reveal any information that would not benefit their clients.<eos> My findings did not.
So, here's what's gonna happen, Andre.<eos> You're suspended for two days.<eos> And then when you get back, you're gonna be on lunchtime cleanup duty.<eos> Wait-- suspended?<eos> I work.<eos> I don't have anybody to watch him.<eos> His mother's not exactly available.<eos> What about all the bullying?<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Walker, but Andre has to learn that his actions have consequences.<eos> Yeah, they sure do.
Back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Couldn't get anything out of Hetty, but she's definitely concerned.<eos> Hmm. You okay?<eos> I don't know what I am.<eos> I mean, is Nate in danger?<eos> Is Callen?<eos> Is there a plan?<eos> If he is in trouble, I just wish he'd reach out somehow.<eos> Maybe he did.
You will begin this process immediately.<eos> Now, don't worry, after your interviews and your polygraphs, most of you will keep your jobs, but it just probably won't be here.<eos> I realize this is a lot to process, so we're going to try and make this transition as quick and painless as possible.<eos> It's obviously going to take a few days to complete the handover, during which time I ask for your continued cooperation and patience.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I feel like we're being punked.<eos> How is SECNAV allowing this?<eos> I don't know why she would, if she had a choice.<eos> Please tell me you have a plan.<eos> Actually... I do.
G, up here!<eos> Come, come, come!<eos> Go!<eos> Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!<eos> Drone footage coming online now.<eos> And I'm being told an osprey is heading towards our guys.<eos> It'll never make it in time.<eos> Beale, is that drone armed?<eos> Yes, sir, but we have no authority to order a strike.<eos> But Duggan does.
Top-down?<eos> 'Cause the Corbett's being controlled by a satellite that's above them.<eos> It's top-down...<eos> I'm gonna clean up some more confetti.<eos> Top-down? That's brilliant.<eos> We can't destroy the satellite because the missiles are grounded, but if we can disrupt the satellite's signal before it gets to the ship, then we can regain control of the destroyer.<eos> But even if we disrupt the signal, you can't reprogram the Corbett's computers without physically being on the boat.<eos> You try to go out to that destroyer, Walt, I guarantee you the hackers will use the ship's weaponry to turn you into Swiss cheese.<eos> And it's moot, anyway, because we have no way to disrupt the hackers' sat signal to the ship.<eos> Yes, we do.
How do we know him?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Dad?<eos> You're the puppet guy that tried to sue us two years and three businesses ago by saying we injured you.<eos> She broke my puppet.<eos> Wait, we never had sex.<eos> Did we?<eos> Do you wiggle a lot?<eos> I do.<eos> But we didn't.
We need to start over.<eos> - Start over?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And I know exactly where.<eos> Can I finish this?<eos> Wait, this is "Badass Cop"?<eos> I thought you said they had a million hits.<eos> This say 403.<eos> You know, the view kind of resets after you hit ten million.<eos> No, it doesn't.
This conflict is bigger than any one of us.<eos> If it means ending the war one day sooner, Amaya would happily make that sacrifice.<eos> But she doesn't have to.<eos> Look, I know you and your team think we're a group of irresponsible losers, but I know Ray Palmer, and he has a plan to get out of that bunker.<eos> We just need to give him time...<eos> Which means giving the Nazis time.<eos> I'm calling in the strike.<eos> I can't let you do that.<eos> You don't have the authority.<eos> Yes, she does.
You found me.<eos> - Bad timing?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Nope.<eos> Masako, these are, uh, my friends I was telling you about.<eos> Hajimemashite.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?<eos> Sake, lots of it.<eos> What he meant to say is thanks for your hospitality, but we must be going.<eos> - No, I didn't.
It looks to be some kind of escape pod.<eos> No doubt, it fell out of the Temporal Zone.<eos> No sign of anyone.<eos> Well, the power core looks exposed.<eos> That mean what I think it means?<eos> Only one way to find out. Ah.<eos> Thought you'd never ask. Back up, everyone.<eos> Ah, what's next?<eos> Don't you think that's enough incineration for one day, Mr. Rory?<eos> No, I do not, Professor.
But it starts right now with us not giving up.<eos> Zambesi.<eos> Your amulet.<eos> You are a warrior of the Zambezi.<eos> You're familiar with it.<eos> That's where my mother was born.<eos> We must follow her.<eos> I believe in her.<eos> I believe in them.<eos> Then I do, too.
I'm obliged.<eos> Ah, your man Colonel Sanders, he, uh... tells me you're his captain.<eos> In any case, he mentioned something about you having regrets about putting men in harm's way.<eos> I don't think that's something I can ever get used to.<eos> You know, by the time I had taken over this division, there had already been three other generals in place before me.<eos> They'd all stepped down and given up.<eos> But I believe in my men.<eos> And I believe in the good that we're doing.<eos> Do you? Do you believe in your mission, Captain Lance?<eos> I do.
Which is probably the most heavily guarded dinner in history.<eos> I think we know someone who may be able to help.<eos> Is that so?<eos> One of Amaya's old JSA buddies, and, by old, I mean old.<eos> He may still have some government contacts we can exploit.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Whatever Darhk is planning to exchange with the Soviets, @ ~ it can't be good.<eos> Well, I'll contact the FBI.<eos> You don't have to worry about it.<eos> Except we do.
- You, Jax, and ray, stop the train.<eos> The rest of us, we'll deal with turnbull.<eos> - You sure about this?<eos> - Of course.<eos> This isn't my first rodeo.<eos> I wanted to say that.<eos> - There's our train.<eos> - Loaded with enough dwarf star to punch a hole in a mountain and cut off the pass to the east.<eos> - How do we stop a moving locomotive?<eos> - We don't.

Harry, we can help her.<eos> We can train her just like we did with Barry.<eos> I don't want you to train her, okay?<eos> I brought her here for you to talk her out of it, not talk her into it, all right, Ramon?<eos> You...you should talk to her. You're a meta.<eos> Yeah, which makes me the last person she should talk to about not using her powers.<eos> Okay, Snow...<eos> Caitlin... You and her, you've always had such a special relationship.<eos> You talk to her.<eos> - No, we don't. - Yeah.
Car alarms, transformers.<eos> What is the connection?<eos> Yeah, we'll get there, fellas.<eos> We'll get there. We just got to keep trying.<eos> Maybe someone's pulling power out of the transformers and using it to power the monster.<eos> Power... yes, the monster.<eos> That's... ah, you just beat me to it, San Francisco.<eos> See, that can't be it, H.R.<eos> - Can't be it... - 'Cause we would have detected<eos> - a surge in the power grid. - We did not.
There was no team to help you.<eos> It was just you and Iris.<eos> The two of you were a brother-sister superhero crime-fighting team.<eos> Why didn't you tell us this before?<eos> You didn't want to know about your Flashpoint lives.<eos> But look, listen to me, you got hurt, all right?<eos> You got hurt bad. So what?<eos> That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster. I... I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.
Stupid about what?<eos> God, I swear I fixed the security system.<eos> Who the hell are you? HR.<eos> Apologies.<eos> HR.<eos> See? Ah.<eos> What you've just been witness to was my partner's likeness, Randolf Morgan.<eos> Okay, I see what's going on here.<eos> You don't have facial transmogrification on this planet, do you?<eos> No, we certainly do not.
6 of hearts.<eos> Come on, 6 of hearts, where are you?<eos> My kingdom for a 6 of hearts.<eos> You shut up for five minutes, I won't have to kill you.<eos> Whoo! There's that temper.<eos> Good thing your kid won't have to grow up with it like your brother did, huh?<eos> What'd you say to me?<eos> How's all that going, anyway?<eos> You ever find that group that paid me to off him?<eos> They didn't.
Johnny, that's insane.<eos> Actually, it's the first thing that's made sense to me in a long while.<eos> Ever since I killed Andy.<eos> You think you need to be punished?<eos> I know I do.<eos> Lyla, I didn't have to pull that trigger, but I did.<eos> Something's wrong with me, baby. Then let me help you.<eos> We will figure this out together.<eos> When I thought Lawton killed Andy, all I wanted to do was bring his murderer to justice.<eos> I still do.
Well, Oliver forfeited his opinion when he left.<eos> Ok, but this is an all hands on deck situation, rag-covered hands included.<eos> Just saying.<eos> Where's Private Jesseman?<eos> This is usually his delivery.<eos> Flu's been tearing through the base, sir.<eos> I drew the short straw.<eos> I don't see you on the list.<eos> Your C.O. should have submitted a change of personnel form.<eos> You sure he didn't?
Wait. 4 years?<eos> I thought there was some other guy in the hood.<eos> No. That was Oliver.<eos> The Hood, the Arrow,<eos> Green Arrow-- all him.<eos> That notebook belonged to my father, and when I was first starting out,<eos> I thought that it was my way to save the city.<eos> Well, I think we now know the message Prometheus is trying to send.<eos> You do?<eos> Because I don't.
What makes you so sure?<eos> Because that guy with the list wouldn't have even thought to ask the question.<eos> I need a cleanup on aisle 12, and also, I got a list of potential victims.<eos> I know you're all upset with me, so thank you for showing up despite that.<eos> Well, we were afraid you would kill us if we didn't.<eos> Heh.<eos> Too soon? Probably.<eos> I was able to cross-reference the list with the city census, nailing it down to 6 potential targets.<eos> How do we know who he'll hit?<eos> We don't.
My fiancée's name is Anna... or was.<eos> What's happening?<eos> You're remembering.<eos> Son, don't you think you should be getting your tuxedo on?<eos> Are you all right, Oliver?<eos> I just need to speak with Thea.<eos> I think I saw her talking to Malcolm over by the ice sculpture.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think you need to clam down.<eos> We both do.
Seriously... No one could have seen this coming.<eos> We don't have time to play the blame game.<eos> We have to find Claybourne.<eos> We were hoping there was something here that could help.<eos> Like ashes?<eos> Those look like crematorium ashes.<eos> The question is whose?<eos> Right. Well, I got to go, so you guys need to run a DNA test on these ashes and bone fragments to find out who this person was and why Prometheus is keeping their remains.<eos> You guys know how to run a DNA sequencer, right?<eos> No. Of course you don't.
He went out to track down a lead, didn't come back, his missed his last 3 call-ins,<eos> GPS on his phone's been switched off.<eos> Do you think he's dead?<eos> I think that every cop that's crossed paths with Prometheus is.<eos> Whether or not Billy's alive-- and believe me, I hope that he is-- the ACU and the SCPD, they need instructions.<eos> Well, we've had a BOLO out for weeks.<eos> I'm not talking about a be on the lookout order.<eos> I'm talking about a shoot to kill.<eos> I don't know how that will sit with the public.<eos> I do.
Have you ever heard the name aaron kim?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's one of the people hobbs helped smuggle into the u.S.<eos> Okay, he was killed this morning.<eos> Did you know him?<eos> I'd met him.<eos> They sent a version of me to kill everyone on the hobbs list, And now you want my help.<eos> Jennifer, it has nothing...<eos> Jennifer? She never told you<eos> No, she didn't.
She's not showing off.<eos> She's genuinely happy. Okay.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> I guess I'm just saying that I'm more Of a wedding on the beach kind of guy,<eos> With just a few people that you love and that love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> And I know that a small beach wedding Sounds absolutely incredible.<eos> It does, right? Mm-hmm.
And 118 just so happens to be the same company that put out the fire this morning.<eos> This surveillence video is from the western annex of the bottling facility.<eos> The fire was nowhere near this location, and yet...<eos> Do we know who this guy is?<eos> Well, firefighters generally have their names printed on the bottom of their turnout jackets, but this bag is blocking it, and happens to be the perfect size for two stolen hard drives.<eos> We don't like the implication either.<eos> But we can't ignore it.<eos> Simpson's killer may be one of his fellow firefighters.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> No one does.
Will do.<eos> You know, this house is Mr. Clean clean.<eos> There's no sign of any criminal activity.<eos> And this sucker is locked up tighter than Fort Knox.<eos> Multiple layers of encryption.<eos> I got to get this back to the lab, see if I can crack this sucker.<eos> Yeah, the only thing I found strange are these.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Bond visited maybe the most romantic destinations in the city.<eos> Hmm, pretty damn intimate for a couple of operatives.<eos> Yeah. Kind of unusual, but then again, NOLA does that to folks.
Sly's working the formula I found.<eos> We should check out the farm?<eos> Yes, go.<eos> We'd better hurry, or Toby's gonna get tortured again.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't think he's being tortured at all.<eos> I heard that call.<eos> He wasn't being tickled.<eos> He said this wasn't a game and Toby wouldn't be leaving with any parting gifts like on a game show, so who wants to bet he saw us when Sylvester was on The Price Is Right?<eos> Even if he did, so what?
Well, who cares?<eos> Get over here.<eos> Toby's in trouble.<eos> I know.<eos> I heard about the trap over the comms.<eos> But I can't just leave him here.<eos> Tell them how to save Toby!<eos> Now! Or what, you'll brain me?<eos> I clearly don't care, Walter.<eos> But you do.
I, um, don't want to talk to anyone right now.<eos> Hey, um, if you still want to go, we should probably hit the road.<eos> It's gonna be a long drive.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Of course. Um, I'll just meet you out by the car.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wow. That was... messy.<eos> Yeah, it's a mess that I made.<eos> I should've stood by my position on intraoffice relationships.<eos> I didn't.
I did get a pretty good screen-grab of one of the people involved.<eos> That's great.<eos> But why are we whispering?<eos> Because.<eos> Look at this.<eos> It's the only image we have of the perpetrator.<eos> They're very aware of the cameras, very prepared.<eos> Until the part where the elephant got away.<eos> Great, but I thought you said you got a clear picture of him.<eos> I did.
Right, and that Beretta is the first piece of hard evidence ever linking him to a crime.<eos> Chin, when was that Beretta supposed to be presented in court?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Without that gun, Waiola walks.<eos> Well, I can assure you my client had nothing to do with the theft of the prototype suit or that Beretta.<eos> Okay, uh, that's-that's fine.<eos> We think, uh, maybe he wasn't behind it, but he had something to do with it and knows who it was.<eos> As a matter of fact, we're pretty sure your client was the first person contacted after that gun was stolen.<eos> You have any evidence to support these claims? Yeah, we do.<eos> We do.
I'll give you that.<eos> B, it's relatable, everybody poops.<eos> And C, it's easy to monetize.<eos> I mean, biology tells us that in order to poop, you have to eat, and I control the food supply.<eos> All right with the biology, okay?<eos> You sell 99 cent virtual penguin food, all right?<eos> Get over yourself.<eos> Winner, winner, chicken-waffle dinner.<eos> You got a location?<eos> I do.
HPD's working on it, but, uh, Vanessa's got no relatives on the Island, and as far as we know, Sara's father is not in the picture, so it's gonna take a little time.<eos> Well, where's the kid? She's next door, at the neighbor's house, where she stayed last night.<eos> Um, HPD's gonna pick her up when Social Services assigns a caseworker.<eos> Anybody told her about her mom yet?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> Speaking of people who need looking after, the killer saw Hirsch's face, so until we catch this guy, he's gonna need some protection.<eos> Yeah, who's, uh, who's gonna be in charge of that?<eos> Officer Kalakaua.<eos> When they told me I was getting protection, I was hoping you'd volunteer.<eos> I didn't.
Why is that, uh, why is that funny?<eos> It's just that you guys seem pretty confident despite your track record.<eos> I'm sorry, "track record"?<eos> Oh, meaning Five-O hasn't had a whole lot of success getting people to open up about me.<eos> You talking about the prison guard from Halawa?<eos> That guy was... he was terrified of you.<eos> But Jimmy Brigante, he's a tough kid.<eos> I mean, I guarantee you, he's gonna give you up in a second if it means less prison time for him.<eos> Her lawyer's upstairs.<eos> How you doing in there anyway?
Yeah. It happened just after the guy ran off.<eos> We were waiting for help.<eos> Angie said she couldn't breathe, and... she was wheezing.<eos> I thought she was going into shock, so I tried to keep her calm until the ambulance came. But then her eyes started to swell shut, and, um, her, uh, her skin broke out.<eos> She was unconscious before the ambulance even got there.<eos> Strange as it may sound, if she was allergic to something on the shooter's clothes, it might help us catch him.<eos> Was she having any symptoms before he grabbed her?<eos> Is it possible it was something in the food?<eos> No. She didn't have any food allergies.<eos> No one in my family does.
I'm the one who-who... knocked out the assailant's front teeth during a Protective Operations exercise.<eos> Yeah, everyone started calling me "The Incisor-nator".<eos> No, still doesn't ring a bell.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I need a snack.<eos> I saw that.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You saw what?<eos> You do remember her.<eos> Course I do.
You don't even rem...<eos> So what do you remember about me?<eos> Um... I do remember you were not the most naturally-skilled agent I've ever seen.<eos> Maybe I'd rather not know.<eos> But that being said, you were persistent.<eos> And every time you got knocked down, you'd get right back up.<eos> And you never made the same mistake twice.<eos> Well, being a field agent definitely forced me out of my comfort zone.<eos> Well, Gibbs made the right call.<eos> He always does.
Go fish.<eos> Took you a pretty long time to figure out if you had a five.<eos> I had to double check.<eos> I like to be certain.<eos> - You like to be cheating.<eos> - Uh, excuse me?<eos> You asked if I had any fives.<eos> So what you need to do is go grab a hook, pop a worm on it, and go damn fish.<eos> He said a swear!<eos> He certainly did.
Thomas Flynn.<eos> Uh, yes...<eos> A warrant to search your residence.<eos> Just step inside.<eos> Tommy, what is this?<eos> What's going on?<eos> You know Mariela Hernandez?<eos> Yes.<eos> She says she delivered a baby girl here two weeks ago.<eos> She didn't.
This is my son, Gerald.<eos> You were on Neighborhood Watch when you heard the shots?<eos> Yeah, two blocks west on Canal Street.<eos> I heard the shots.<eos> Maybe two dozen.<eos> Sounded like a semi-auto.<eos> You trained on handguns?<eos> We're both tactically certified.<eos> Do you all carry weapons?<eos> - Some of us do.
Hey, Polly...<eos> Have you ever met a person and just known that you didn't have to worry about them?<eos> Like, no matter where they go, everything's gonna be okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess.<eos> Aunt Nancie and Uncle Marshall, this is Erin.<eos> She's a detective.<eos> She helped me a lot.<eos> So, Doc, how did you know the girl was gonna remember the shooter?<eos> I didn't.
- Why?<eos> - Last night Serafino left his job.<eos> That thief took off the apron and touched the balls!<eos> - Without any explanation? "I would only have missed that idiot had greeted me."<eos> Pretty joke made me after all these years!<eos> Now I must find someone fast!<eos> Do not talk like that to the commissary, Gaeta, what are you going to think?<eos> Poor, with what happened to him, was very bad.<eos> - Do you know if Serafino is wearing the alliance?<eos> - Of course he does.
Your witness is a delinquent with four priors.<eos> But the priors are for tagging.<eos> I don't care if they are for jaywalking.<eos> This is not a slam-dunk case.<eos> If you saw the kid, you would know he was telling the truth.<eos> Let me explain something to you two about how this works.<eos> First, you build a case, then you go for an arrest.<eos> I don't know who the hell told you it was a good idea<eos> - to bring in...<eos> - I did.
You're funny, I'll give you that.<eos> I was just thinking, you know, we got a lot in common, all right?<eos> You've been chased by assassins, I've been chased by assassins.<eos> Apparently, we wear the same size pants.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - Uh, of course not.<eos> I've never worn your pants.<eos> But anyways, this is what I'm saying... I think it would just benefit everyone here if you gave me your number.<eos> Or I could just look it up in your file.<eos> Or... maybe I already did.
His son wasn't so lucky.<eos> Paul got 15 years at a prison in Upstate New York.<eos> He was just four years from finishing his term when he got killed by another inmate.<eos> Stabbed during a fight ten months ago.<eos> There's another wrinkle in the story.<eos> Didi, tell him the wrinkle.<eos> This is excellent work.<eos> I couldn't do my job without you.<eos> If there is by any chance that this story has another wrinkle...<eos> Why, it does.
That's enough!<eos> My son is dead. Did you know that?<eos> He was killed in prison.<eos> In a fight with another inmate.<eos> Vaughn, I had nothing to do with that, okay?<eos> You had everything to do with it!<eos> And that's when I knew I couldn't let you get away with what you'd done to me.<eos> So I got in touch with my friends in low places.<eos> Keeping watch until someone made a mistake, and then...<eos> Someone did.
You have a family with another child on the way.<eos> Isn't your life already a fantasy?<eos> I actually think it helps my marriage.<eos> Should we test that theory? What about the girl?<eos> Look, I passed out, drunk.<eos> I woke up around 5:00 a.m., and... Heather or Destiny or whatever the hell her name is was already gone...<eos> along with my credit card.<eos> I'm the real victim here.<eos> All right, it's not that we don't believe your story.<eos> - We don't.
This is a prank phone call. We're detectives.<eos> How about this for a bet:<eos> Cole asks us to investigate a prank phone call, and I'll kiss you square on the lips.<eos> I need you to investigate this prank call.<eos> - I did not give consent.<eos> - We didn't shake on it.<eos> Captain, we're detectives.<eos> Don't you think this is a little beneath us?<eos> Just curious, did either of you donate half a million to the mayor's reelection campaign?<eos> Because Walter Brighton did, so...
And, you know, I couldn't figure out the reason...<eos> There was no reason, okay?<eos> You can't find sense where there is none.<eos> And it's okay, it's not your fault.<eos> - But when you lost them...<eos> Taken.<eos> By them.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I said no.<eos> I should never have said anything.<eos> And I'm not saying anymore.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, this little conversation here never happened.<eos> Now, get out of my office!<eos> Who is this man in the yellow hat, dude?<eos> He takes a monkey into a bakery and just leaves him there.<eos> And then he decides all of a sudden that he wants to go run errands.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> He did the same thing last episode.
Could I just, um, stretch my legs for a minute?<eos> Just for a few steps?<eos> We've been in here for hours.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Pickering may not talk, but we know there is more going on inside than anybody thinks.<eos> If we take what we've learned and bring it to Taymor...<eos> He'll arrest us before we even get a chance to talk.<eos> And even if he does let us talk, we can't prove any of this.<eos> But we have to do something.<eos> Yeah. We do.
Totally understandable.<eos> Okay, I think we've proven once and for all that you think I'm amazing.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Come on!<eos> You picked me out of that entire group of cops to be your hero.<eos> You signaled to me.<eos> I was signaling to anyone who was watching.<eos> I didn't even see you out there.<eos> I don't even know how he fits an ego that big into a frame that small.<eos> Did I do it?
Okay, there's gotta be something we can do.<eos> Something I can do.<eos> I was the one that suggested it in the first place.<eos> Do we have $20,000?<eos> What?<eos> Monte knows this attorney who specializes in helping people get off the list, and that's the discount rate.<eos> Okay, how does this help you?<eos> Well, if he can get Gabe's record expunged, it's like he was never on the list and then we did nothing wrong.<eos> All right, well, I hate to tell you this, honey, but we don't have $20,000.<eos> We do on a line of credit on the house...
Can I help you?<eos> Hi, Sheila.<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Callie?<eos> - Oh, Callie!<eos> - Hey.<eos> Come in!<eos> Your project sounds wonderful.<eos> I just hope you remember this home as a safe and loving one.<eos> I do, yeah.
And alive.<eos> I really think I would have killed myself if... if you didn't tell me that you love me.<eos> That meant so much.<eos> The fact that someone as beautiful as you are loves me.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> You're like my reason for living.<eos> I do love you and want you to get better, but... not for me... but for yourself.<eos> As long as I have you, I can do that.<eos> I do have you, right?<eos> Yes, you do.
Well, then, let us go find that alternative, okay?<eos> Because that's what Chloe wanted.<eos> Please. I need you to come with me to my orchard.<eos> You know, we're not gonna go anywhere with you.<eos> You can keep your stupid plane.<eos> We'll find another way to get Jamie and find a cure.<eos> What he said.<eos> Did Chloe ever mention "The Courier"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did, right...
So where are all the snakes hiding?<eos> Snake came in through the toilet, right?<eos> It certainly looks like it.<eos> I think I got an idea.<eos> This is the aquifer that runs underneath your property.<eos> It supplies water to all the farms in the county.<eos> My thought is that the snakes are shedding their toxic glass directly into your farm's water supply.<eos> What about the drinking water?<eos> The county draws it from the river, so at least we don't have to worry about - contamination.<eos> - But we do.
You put a suicidal mission in office, and I took advantage of it.<eos> We are public enemies number one and two.<eos> The people don't trust us.<eos> That's because they've been poisoned.<eos> We'll change their minds.<eos> You know, before the quarantine was in place in St. Louis, it was just me and 115 people in a Costco.<eos> But I was able to protect them, because they wanted more than anything to be there.<eos> Not like those broken people we saw in that shelter.<eos> Back then, ‭the people wanted to fight.<eos> They still do, sir.
Loop in Harpers Ferry PD.<eos> Gibbs, I was doing background on Anne Marshall, and the situation she's in is completely unfair.<eos> What situation?<eos> The only reason she can't practice law here is because West Virginia's bar doesn't reciprocate with California.<eos> So, her 15 years of experience went to nothing just because she crossed state lines.<eos> Bishop, focus on the case.<eos> It's not right, Gibbs.<eos> When troops fight for their country, their families do, too.<eos> Anne Marshall, all the military spouses out there, who-who fights for them?<eos> We do.
A little of this, a little of that.<eos> I've been making that for my mom since I was, like, seven.<eos> - Oh! Oh, you're serious.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You want to give me a hand with this?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Careful.<eos> Hey! Well, if it isn't Emma's co-conspirator.<eos> Oh, so sweet of you, but you didn't have to bring anything.<eos> Oh, I didn't.
this is great.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Why did you change your mind?<eos> Eli.<eos> He said you wanted something big.<eos> Hey, let's go...<eos> let's go say hi to some people.<eos> Why did you invite Stavo?<eos> I thought he creeped you out.<eos> He does and I didn't.
I've been on for 17 hours.<eos> Getting too old for this.<eos> I bet you're glad I saved his life.<eos> How's Tom Anderson?<eos> His arm's broken.<eos> He's undergone a closed reduction to pull the bones back into position.<eos> He's been sent home with his arm in a cast.<eos> Given that you're less likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder if you don't sleep after a bad experience, maybe I should...keep you awake a wee bit longer at least.<eos> Don't you have a home to go to?<eos> I do.
Peter, no, you didn't.<eos> Peter, Brandon's alive, okay?<eos> And we're gonna take care of him right now.<eos> All right?<eos> I'm gonna need to talk to you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> We told that kid that he didn't kill his friend.<eos> He didn't.
They're not even my kids.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> They're family.<eos> Family messes you up.<eos> That part's new for me.<eos> Got a minute?<eos> Ben. What are you...<eos> I just came by to, uh...<eos> You know, I-I had a nice conversation - with Don Heller just now.<eos> - You did?
I'm sorry. It's very unlikely.<eos> The gun was locked up.<eos> It was supposed to be locked in a drawer.<eos> - I don't know how they...<eos> - Kids watch.<eos> You cut just deep enough They pick up everything you do.<eos> I'm very sorry that this happened.<eos> Hey.<eos> Brandon didn't die?<eos> No. He didn't.
Then, I'll just...<eos> I'll do a repeat ultrasound in two weeks to see...<eos> Two weeks?<eos> I can't wait two weeks.<eos> We might be able to do something.<eos> I know that you're worried, but I... I really...<eos> Look, what about a fetal MRI...<eos> To get a better look at the baby's brain?<eos> To get a clear image, I'd have to put you and the baby under general anesthesia, and I... I don't want to do that unless I have to.<eos> Neither do you.
So many objections.<eos> Badgering, irrelevant...<eos> - Sustained. - I'm sorry.<eos> I don't mean to belabor the point, but you said it yourself.<eos> You've only known Sofia a few months, so...<eos> No, that is not what I meant.<eos> But that is what you said.<eos> All right, Counselor.<eos> I know what grade she's in.<eos> I do.
Stephanie, stop.<eos> We tried everything we could.<eos> His brain had already infarcted from herniation.<eos> It was too far gone.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> And she's standing there with these sad eyes like she's the victim.<eos> She's not the victim.<eos> Callie caused all this, she set it all in motion, and now here we are and there's not one part of it that doesn't suck, you know?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
I didn't know you could do that.<eos> Are you a doctor?<eos> I am.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Um, Louise, do you remember your son at all? Donnie?<eos> Son? Son? I...<eos> I don't have any children.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, a-actually, you do.
- She used to score big from some other guy before she got clean.<eos> But then Gillian cut him off completely, and the guy, he was super pissed.<eos> Right, and where can I find this other dealer?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Oh... - No, I-I-I swear<eos> I've never met him.<eos> Look, he goes by the name of... of Bobby B.<eos> Lovely.<eos> I thought you said this case doesn't have anything to do with your mom anymore.<eos> It doesn't.
Look,<eos> I don't know what your deal is, but you make me a better detective.<eos> And you've always got my back.<eos> What more could I ask for?<eos> And you need the eggs.<eos> Damn right I do.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> We don't have an appointment.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
Sounded... ridiculous.<eos> But you convinced me.<eos> It took you months, but you convinced me.<eos> You made me want it, and then you took it away.<eos> You have to believe me when I say how sorry I am, and that I know I screwed up.<eos> But honestly, I did it for you.<eos> Because I believed in you so much...<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - You know I did.<eos> - Y-You didn't.

It is the wedding of NSA Chief Jake Ballard and attorney/Washington socialite Vanessa Moss.<eos> The two are set to wed later today in what many insiders are calling the wedding of the decade in the nation's capital.<eos> When you break the news to Jake that he's still going to marry Vanessa, tell him that you've changed your mind.<eos> I know what you're planning, Olivia.<eos> He's throwing his life away for you.<eos> You think this is about me getting power.<eos> See, unlike you, I've had power, achieved greatness.<eos> This is about Jake finally stepping forward and accepting his own greatness.<eos> He doesn't want it.<eos> He never did.
'Cause I really don't want to give her that kind of news.<eos> Tamarac Sugar.<eos> I believe you're familiar with them?<eos> They're currently under investigation by my office, so, yes.<eos> I'd like you to drop your investigation.<eos> And why would I do that?<eos> Because there's still time before the primary, which means there's still time for me to change my mind and endorse someone other than Senator Grant.<eos> Say, Susan, for instance.<eos> Do you realize what you're suggesting, Governor?<eos> Because maybe you don't.

Hold on just one second.<eos> I just want to get this over with, okay?<eos> He's gonna be in his old classroom.<eos> Listen, we don't know what you're walking into right now.<eos> We have no idea.<eos> True?<eos> I'm about to "convince" sleazy Branson to keep his mouth shut.<eos> I don't trust him.<eos> You came to me because you said that I'm dark and I understand this stuff.<eos> Well, I do!
Whoa!<eos> No, I thought you were the paramedics.<eos> One of the teachers fell.<eos> It's awful.<eos> - Ms. Lang!<eos> - She's still breathing.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Brooke, you were supposed to stay outside.<eos> - Did somebody call an ambulance?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, he did.
Oh, God, or something even worse.<eos> So, why didn't he go through with it?<eos> - The janitor.<eos> - He was interrupted by the janitor.<eos> Before you got there, before he could finish whatever he was doing.<eos> If that hadn't happened, who knows what I would have been walking into?<eos> This isn't good, Maggie.<eos> Emma and I came back here.<eos> We didn't find anything.<eos> Well, I did.
She was young when she had her daughter.<eos> Perhaps she felt the need to seduce him on her rise to power, or theirs was a love for the ages.<eos> Neither scenario changes what we have to do now.<eos> I notice you didn't mention anything about Krasnov.<eos> You don't want him to know that we know that he was the one who set off the bomb.<eos> Why tempt him to disappear his favorite assassin?<eos> If we can find Krasnov and connect him to Vikner...<eos> We'll have them both.<eos> The police know about Krasnov. How do we explain Vikner?<eos> We don't.
Earlier with the girls, all that stuff you were saying about my grades not being worth anything, - it hurt my feelings.<eos> - Oh, come on. I was kidding.<eos> Didn't feel like kidding.<eos> Everybody there said they were happy for me, proud of me, even the waitress gave me a free piece of cheesecake.<eos> All you did was put me down.<eos> For God's sakes, that was just me kibitzing.<eos> That's what I do, I kibitz.<eos> You still never said you were proud of me.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> No, you didn't.
- you mean...<eos> - Cholinesterase.<eos> It's a sedative.<eos> Hypnotic.<eos> Who says we never do anything fun together, huh?<eos> Okay, you ready? No.<eos> All right.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought you'd just ignore what I want.<eos> Well, of course I did.
You didn't tell her, did you?<eos> About what?<eos> The surprise party.<eos> Oh.<eos> No, I wouldn't do that.<eos> Because she was asking if the three of us wanted to hang on Saturday, so I thought maybe she suspected something.<eos> No, I would never do that.<eos> I know how to keep a secret.<eos> Good to know.<eos> Too bad Rafe doesn't.
Time to move on.<eos> This doesn't have anything to do with last night, does it?<eos> Why would it be?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Look, you're the one that should be all fucked up, knowing your boyfriend pimped you out to somebody else.<eos> He didn't.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, no offense, Dillon, but you know nothing about our relationship.<eos> No, but I know quite a bit about Elliott.<eos> Not as much as I do.
- Speak when spoken to.<eos> Where are your scrips?<eos> No need to rush, Brother.<eos> Let's eat first.<eos> - We shouldn't linger.<eos> - We haven't eaten in two days.<eos> This fool and his money aren't going anywhere.<eos> He's got apples.<eos> Nobody has apples anymore.<eos> He does.
Those guys hurt my back.<eos> There's a bag up there.<eos> Can you reach it?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> My supervisors called me a fraud when I told them the ARQ was generating limitless energy.<eos> I couldn't really blame them, though.<eos> Perpetual motion's a myth.<eos> Then Torus seized the ARQ.<eos> Now why take something that didn't work?<eos> Because it does.
Then... what?<eos> Give me five minutes alone with Renton.<eos> Leave you two alone together?<eos> Yeah, that won't look at all suspicious.<eos> Just go to the kitchen and eat.<eos> That's believable.<eos> We're not here to eat.<eos> He has apples.<eos> Nobody has apples anymore.<eos> He does.
What? She wants to kill it?<eos> That is not her intent, but if she has her way, it will be the result.<eos> Well, sorry to hear that.<eos> Nothing's settled yet, but moving forward means getting all the equity owners to overrule her.<eos> We've got 35%, and then there's Diane and Bos and Doug and Craig.<eos> And Cameron has no idea this is happening?<eos> It's all talk at the moment, but I...<eos> I have to explore every option.<eos> We don't own 35% of the company.<eos> - Yeah, sure we do.
I would not call it kicking it.<eos> We didn't exactly chill balls.<eos> He did offer me a job, though.<eos> - What was the pitch?<eos> - Oh, you know, the ushe. ASM's doomed. Miami Wealth is my only lifeboat.<eos> I shouldn't trust you. Trying to turn this whole thing around on me, huh?<eos> See you dudes later.<eos> Good luck with that cough.<eos> You do trust me, right? Yeah.<eos> Of course I do.
I'll pass.<eos> Come on, Spence.<eos> You can't let your pride derail you of making the right decision again.<eos> I can't get you anything you want. I can get it myself.<eos> I don't need you to get it for me.<eos> How you gonna hunt down $15 million?<eos> None of your goddamn business where I'm gonna get it from.<eos> I'll get it. Tell me you're not gonna get it from your clients.<eos> Spence, that is the reason why me and you are in this mess.<eos> Please, do anything but that.
- Siefert said they overlap...<eos> Siefert said?<eos> You know what? Fine.<eos> We'll go without you.<eos> You're going with him?<eos> Aw, look at the little babe.<eos> - She's adorable.<eos> - Oh, my "widdle-widdle."<eos> Aw, you know, Manny, she really likes you. Manny:<eos> She does, she does. Julie:
There really is an app for everything.<eos> Smart thinking.<eos> Well, it is smart, but it's also very risky because, you see, now we have a list of everybody that you sold drugs to.<eos> - Look, man, we know this meth isn't being made on this island.<eos> Okay?<eos> I mean, the level of purity-- there's an industrial process going on here.<eos> And Oahu is too small to run that kind of operation without attracting attention.<eos> See?<eos> He looks a little confused.<eos> He does, doesn't he?
Can you please just be honest?<eos> Honest about what?<eos> About everything!<eos> About anything.<eos> I...<eos> I'm not doing good here, man.<eos> Everything's a frigging joke to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You want honesty?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You good?<eos> See now, Mo.<eos> You done made my breakfast all cold.<eos> I need something to heat this up with.<eos> Now I'd like to go back and finish the rest of it before it all get cold, too. So I'll make this quick now.<eos> Who shot Joelle?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, you do. - You do know.<eos> - I don't.<eos> - I really don't.
My nigger.<eos> You did good. You did good, blood, you did good.<eos> Cut him loose, make sure he get back across 95.<eos> - Say what?<eos> - You heard me.<eos> That ain't how we do.<eos> I'm the one who say how we do.<eos> Jey-jey'd want me to waste 'im.<eos> - He didn't kill nobody.<eos> Davis did. - Eye for an eye.
He is in here because of us.<eos> (SCOFFS) Keep telling yourself that, Ezra.<eos> (SPEAKING UGNESE) Who's the pig?<eos> Purple guy, Mando girl, and Ezra Bridger.<eos> My, look how you have grown.<eos> Ah, I knew you would not let your old partner, Hondo, rot away in this prison.<eos> Hondo, it's good to see you.<eos> Not really.<eos> You better have the intel you promised.<eos> Yes, we do.
Don't worry, Sabine.<eos> I got us into this, I'll get us out.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What is he doing?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> What's that driver doing?<eos> We're not rebels!<eos> They're over there!<eos> SABINE: When did Kanan teach you that?<eos> He didn't.
You sold us out.<eos> Not me. Check your own backyard.<eos> Thanks for this, by the way. Good work.<eos> I mean it.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Well, we kind of figured you wouldn't give us the jellyfish.<eos> - Antivenom.<eos> - Thinking these might come in handy.<eos> - We don't have time for this.<eos> Yes, we do, okay?
- I said do not worry.<eos> Do you know... It's both Dussehra (HINDU) and Muharram (MUSLIM) today.<eos> While the Muslims mourn, Hindus celebrate.<eos> This year, the festival of Ganesha and Bakr-Eid coincided too!<eos> People sin so much that they need religion to hide behind.<eos> It's a carnival of religions out there.<eos> ...so much that even God is paraded on streets. Each religion flaunting its might of majority.<eos> But we... real children of God... converse with him.<eos> Do you converse with God?<eos> Do you?

You will feel my wrath.<eos> The wrath of Savitar!<eos> Did it work?<eos> That was so scary.<eos> I mean, that was... was it not truly frightening, what the voice and the prophesies and the... it was...<eos> I mean, that a scare-a-thon, wasn't it?<eos> I'm gonna have a mint tea and a coffee and a lay down.<eos> Do you think the things that he said about one of us betraying him and one of us dying could really be true?<eos> I mean, if it really was future Barry that pissed him off and locked him up somewhere, then maybe he knows what happens to future us.<eos> He doesn't.
Out of bounds.<eos> Wait. What do you mean by "lives"?<eos> I want to see Amenadiel. What?<eos> It's time.<eos> I am not going to live in fear of my own son.<eos> We may have had our differences...<eos> He literally carried you to Hell.<eos> But I created him.<eos> Certainly that has to count for something.<eos> It doesn't.
Yes. And lucky for me, I found out where you were headed.<eos> I mean, these videos are enthralling.<eos> No, I-I can't.<eos> I can't watch these.<eos> Oh, I've seen worse.<eos> But never so many collected in one single room.<eos> You know, if I ever go back to Hell, I am getting me one of these.<eos> Selfish bastards get to see everything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They do.
Just like the people you punished.<eos> I don't!<eos> I...<eos> I do.<eos> I-I like seeing them beg for forgiveness.<eos> You see, the difference between us is that you became part of the problem, Ray.<eos> Someone deserving punishment.<eos> You're right.<eos> I do.<eos> We all do.
And since Williams is targeting spouses, if we find Mrs. Peterson, assuming...<eos> No, wait... crap.<eos> - What?<eos> It also says that the trial was run by a Dr. Sally Peterson.<eos> They're a husband and wife team.<eos> Great.<eos> Who's the target?<eos> Well, it could be either one.<eos> We got to get to both of them.<eos> Yeah, before he does.
But it's not a metaphor,<eos> Doctor.<eos> You need to take me seriously.<eos> You need to believe what I'm saying.<eos> Otherwise, you'll never understand...<eos> I'm a monster.<eos> A monster who... deserves to be punished.<eos> I believe you feel that way.<eos> And I want to understand.<eos> I truly do!
That was a terrible move, Detective.<eos> It was, right?<eos> What were you planning to do, Chloe?<eos> Crash the christening?<eos> I don't know, Dan!<eos> I was angry.<eos> The guy killed my father.<eos> He had the nerve to smile at me.<eos> Do you have any idea what that feels like? No.<eos> No, I don't.
Mourn with him, maybe?<eos> ! - I...<eos> - So I reached out, and guess what I got back.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Like always.<eos> So I figured that if his toys started stabbing each other with a celestial blade, that maybe he might take a moment.<eos> Humans are dying because of you.<eos> Well, humans die.<eos> They all do eventually.
I got to rush back.<eos> Where's Lucifer?<eos> Something came up at his club.<eos> I don't think he's coming back.<eos> Oh, well, don't worry, Chloe.<eos> He never stays away for too long, right?<eos> Huh. Hey, Lucifer.<eos> So, did you splint the stubbed toe, or did you kiss it and make it better?<eos> Well, that's an interesting theory, but we don't have any evidence that Eric Cooper's the killer.<eos> Mm, actually we do.
He's on his way to MIT, full scholarship. And you want him to throw all that out for a contract to be a rapper?<eos> The world doesn't need another rapper.<eos> Lucious...<eos> Lucious did that so that you could be pissed at me.<eos> Are you for real?<eos> Yeah. That's how he plays, dirty.<eos> All right, well, I don't care about all that.<eos> This kid's future is bright.<eos> So whatever y'all did to tempt him, you need to undo it.<eos> - Oh, I do, do I?
I haven't seen your mother yet, dear.<eos> She's about to make her entrance.<eos> Everyone knows that I dislike artifice, so I'm going to thank you all in advance for your very generous contributions to Angelo's mayoral campaign.<eos> Please fill out the cards, place them in the little velvet bags being passed around by my staff, and enjoy the champagne et canapés, mes amis.<eos> Well done, Mother.<eos> So, where is Cookie Lyon?<eos> Um, I don't know.<eos> Let's give her... a few more minutes.<eos> You don't know?<eos> I don't. Mother.
Where you been, anyway?<eos> I'll take it from here, thanks.<eos> Ah... Can you give us a minute, Tiffany?<eos> You want to get your nails done?<eos> Nah, I'm more of a rub and tug type.<eos> Listen, so far, we got nothin'.<eos> All right, no disrespect, but your cornball half-brother lives like a monk.<eos> Okay, he doesn't gamble, no drugs, doesn't really drink, I mean, it's damn near insulting.<eos> I thought we had somebody on the inside.<eos> We do.
And I felt the devil at my hands.<eos> I yanked that wheel right into oncoming traffic.<eos> She did this to me.<eos> She did this to us.<eos> She has taken lives.<eos> Don't you understand that by keeping her here, we're protecting you?<eos> By doing what?<eos> Beating the hell out of her?<eos> Pain purges sin.<eos> No, it doesn't.
I don't know!<eos> Ask the guards.<eos> All right, I want you to listen to me.<eos> That nursery's owned by a drug dealer.<eos> And we suspect that those warehouses are tied to his business, but what I can't do with a suspicion is take it to the police and use that as probable cause to look into those shipments.<eos> So I need something specific.<eos> Something you've actually seen.<eos> I don't want to get in trouble.<eos> You don't know what it's like in here.<eos> Actually, Nate, I do.
Juvenile detention.<eos> Yeah. I, um... I know what it is.<eos> You didn't know he went there.<eos> Figures.<eos> You wouldn't have slid that ring on your finger if you knew half the things I do.<eos> What things?<eos> Good God.<eos> I told you.<eos> You had it coming.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Now that's another lie, isn't it?<eos> Wait! Just...<eos> - Please...<eos> - Get out.<eos> - Let me... - I said go!<eos> Now!<eos> How do they know where to go?<eos> He refuses to eat.<eos> He will eventually.<eos> And if he doesn't?
Green for bonded, blue for unbonded.<eos> Yes, but how did you get your eyes like that?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Are your primary users out?<eos> Mr Barber resides here, but is in Barbados on holiday with Marissa.<eos> Marissa's your sister?<eos> Marissa's Mr Barber's lover.<eos> She is 27 years old.<eos> She occasionally stays here when Mr Barber does.<eos> When he does?
- Okay.<eos> - Thanks so much for having me.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Heard so much about you from Ron.<eos> Really?<eos> Good. Good.<eos> I brought you guys some wine.<eos> I know he doesn't drink.<eos> I didn't know...<eos> - No, he doesn't, but I do.
Honestly, I don't know.<eos> No, I didn't before.<eos> The person that... - Taylor!<eos> - ...that I knew!<eos> But no...<eos> You know me.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I don't know you!<eos> I don't know you because, Nick,<eos> I don't, okay?
Nice work.<eos> How'd you get it?<eos> I hacked his shit way before you came to us.<eos> Our girl got trust issues.<eos> So... what's the catch?<eos> The catch... is that you're not gonna use that to blackmail him.<eos> You... work for us now.<eos> You're gonna use it to bring him down without implicating us in any legal activity.<eos> I don't think you understand how this works.<eos> - We don't? - No.
I'll be back.<eos> I was working on your commencement speech, and I was hoping you could give me some personal anecdote that-that proffers some nugget of wisdom that we could give the kids.<eos> Uh, saving the Pacific Rim Trade Agreement, for example.<eos> Détente with Russia.<eos> Dropping the embargo with Cuba.<eos> I mean, there's a lot of good options.<eos> Yeah, I-I-I don't know if any of that really jibes with my overall message.<eos> You have an overall message?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do I?
We didn't break up.<eos> I-I just needed a little time to freak out.<eos> It was the worst<eos> - five days of my life.<eos> - Three.<eos> Followed by the greatest proposal ever.<eos> Yes, the discount skywriter.<eos> "Mar Me Elibet."<eos> Hey, it worked.<eos> It did.
- How many?<eos> - 400.<eos> We'll figure it out.<eos> And, Matt, you're not gonna be a disappointment.<eos> You're gonna crush it.<eos> Elise.<eos> Russell...<eos> Now that I'm on the other side of this, it is pretty rude.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Yes, we do.
Sailor.<eos> How's she doing?<eos> I have to be judicious with the antimalarial treatment because of her pregnancy.<eos> - Did you test her blood?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Both Kyoko and her husband have the virus and the cure in their bloodstream.<eos> - The cure is just not working.<eos> - Then you need to run more tests.<eos> Sir, now that Dr. Scott's lab is broken down, I don't have the equipment to do extensive blood work.<eos> And even if I did...
We ran out of polish.<eos> Hey, I can go get you some more.<eos> Is that "Flamingo Drag?"<eos> "Watermelon Pie."<eos> You would do that?<eos> What, to kick those up a notch?<eos> Hey, why don't we both go?<eos> We'll grab some more colors, a couple of lattes, and then we'll come right back.<eos> You can trust her.<eos> I do.
I've never done that before.<eos> Hmm. How'd it feel?<eos> Empowering?<eos> I just have something I need to tell you before you go.<eos> How do you know I'm going?<eos> Because I'm Abby Sciuto, and I know things.<eos> Why did I ask?<eos> I know how much... Ziva... really loved you.<eos> And I need to know that you know that, too.<eos> I do.
- No! I'm not done.<eos> And you know what I saw?<eos> Nothing!<eos> No white light.<eos> Just big, black, empty nothing.<eos> And that's where Jake is right now!<eos> Instead of up here, with me, where he belonged.<eos> Unless we wake up and stop acting like this isn't Murderville, we're all gonna end up like Jake.<eos> And we'll deserve it.<eos> But he didn't.
I think you pirated a very sensitive file from Noah's computer and sent it to Emma.<eos> - Okay, and why would I do that?<eos> - To make me think it was Noah, cause a rift between us, get me out of the picture.<eos> I'm not stupid, Audrey.<eos> You're obviously impossible to get out of the picture.<eos> No wonder Noah's still a virgin.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean for that to sound so...<eos> Jealous?<eos> 'Cause it did.
Hey there, stranger.<eos> Miss me?<eos> I was starting to think we'd never get any alone time.<eos> No need for the silent treatment.<eos> Everything worked out perfect.<eos> They all showed up, just like you wanted.<eos> I guess I'll just have to find somewhere else to put my lips.<eos> They're not labeled.<eos> How do we know which breaker controls that giant room?<eos> We don't.
Oh, and Nadine?<eos> I know you're trying.<eos> I appreciate it, but you need to try harder.<eos> Here are the shells. Good luck with the bird.<eos> Good to see you, Bob Lee.<eos> Got your regular order right here.<eos> Not today, Henry.<eos> I'm trying out a new rifle.<eos> You got any .338 Lapua Magnum?<eos> Sure we do.
What? The Singularity?<eos> It's when computers learn to outsmart man like women did years ago.<eos> See, what I was doing, it was like a joke.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Well, that's what you call a joke? Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, you guys have those.<eos> - You guys have those here, right?<eos> - Yeah, yeah. We do at the moment.
- The one who's been calling?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Why'd he give it to you, Pop?<eos> Said we could do it ourselves, any one of us.<eos> What about Brad and Travis?<eos> What about them?<eos> They want their cut, too.<eos> You really wanna have that conversation now?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do, actually.
Nothing will happen?<eos> So vulnerable, that the parents decide to become their pillars of strength.<eos> And when this responsibility comes on a single parent, he needs double the strength.<eos> Like I did.<eos> Is Mom in Heaven?<eos> Some people do call America Heaven.<eos> Why did she go there?<eos> She went there to work, and grew fond of that place.<eos> Did she love me?<eos> Yes, of course she did.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I'll go back to Bogotá with the body until the funeral.<eos> They call his wife?<eos> Yeah, she's on her way from Madrid.<eos> This ain't on you, Javi.<eos> It's on Escobar.<eos> And one way or another, he pays.<eos> We all do.
Let's do it.<eos> Thank you, everybody!<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> And welcome to the first ever Grand Tour.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, we hope you like our tent.<eos> We think the great thing is that because it roams around the world, we get a different view out of the big picture windows every week.<eos> So this week, obviously we've got the high desert of California.<eos> - Next week, who knows?<eos> - I do.
Daewon?<eos> He's not here.<eos> Look around. My guy traced the IP address back here... this morning.<eos> You, my friend, look like someone who works very hard, huh?<eos> Maybe you should have a little fun.<eos> - Please, take Karina.<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> I said don't do that!<eos> Don't do that.
Just say "nigga," be done with it.<eos> - God, I was not gonna say that!<eos> - No! No! - Listen!<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> - That's not what this... shut up!<eos> Let me know when there's no one making threats to me or my entire family. We can talk about business.<eos> Let me know when you grow a sack of nuts.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Listen, I believed in GenCoin, Izzy.<eos> - I still do, but not like this.
No, it's good.<eos> Your dad's thing?<eos> Yeah, his fundraiser.<eos> I was thinking about putting you in a foursome with him.<eos> Really? I mean, you totally don't need to go if you don't want to.<eos> I just don't want him to try and hook me up with a job or anything.<eos> I know, I know, but look, that's my dad, okay?<eos> It's literally the only way he knows how to show people he cares about 'em.<eos> - He likes you.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Yeah, his fundraiser.<eos> I was thinking about putting you in a foursome with him.<eos> Really? I mean, you totally don't need to go if you don't want to.<eos> I just don't want him to try and hook me up with a job or anything.<eos> I know, I know, but look, that's my dad, okay?<eos> It's literally the only way he knows how to show people he cares about 'em.<eos> - He likes you.<eos> - No, he doesn't.<eos> - Yes, he does.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
You dodged a bullet.<eos> You missed it by that much.<eos> I'll still show you my dick if you wanna see it.<eos> Leo tells me that you work at a bank.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Valencia.<eos> - What do you do there?<eos> - Small business loans.<eos> What, he didn't... he didn't tell you all about it?<eos> - He did. - Yeah.
Total. All in.<eos> What you worth?<eos> Man, nothing.<eos> I'm in debt.<eos> I've been paying off a student loan for 10 years.<eos> - Shit!<eos> - I know.<eos> I've been in your spot.<eos> How you pay your rent?<eos> He doesn't.
What you worth?<eos> Man, nothing.<eos> I'm in debt.<eos> I've been paying off a student loan for 10 years.<eos> - Shit!<eos> - I know.<eos> I've been in your spot.<eos> How you pay your rent?<eos> He doesn't.<eos> His girl does.
See you tomorrow.<eos> Ronald: Homeboy smart.<eos> He knows how he gonna market the shit.<eos> He already know how he gonna monetize the shit.<eos> He knew that shit before we came to his house like some chumps holding swimming trunks.<eos> He wants to know why you.<eos> He wants to know your personal story.<eos> Nick: Well, I can tell him about microfinancing and NGOs.<eos> I can't imagine he wants to hear that.<eos> He definitely doesn't.
You good.<eos> Let's see what these other fools talkin' about.<eos> Come on, now, open season.<eos> Cook your own meat, dawg.<eos> Let's charbroil this fool.<eos> You about it? You about it?<eos> Cook your own meat.<eos> Don't I take care of y'all?<eos> Don't I take care of y'all niggas?<eos> You goddamn right I do!
Man, fuck the club!<eos> Could have stayed at home and finished "Amadeus" and had a better time, man.<eos> - Well, that's true.<eos> - Look, man.<eos> Marcus Miles over there getting all the cream, man, hogging all the hos.<eos> Fuck him too!<eos> Marcus Miles is pretty cool, man.<eos> You know he got that invisible car?<eos> What?<eos> Nigga, no he don't.
Don't worry, I'll be out soon, we'll make up for lost time.<eos> The toughest thing is being without you, my love.<eos> When I get out, I'll chew you up!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> Now that our Spanish friend's gone, things are changing fast, understand?<eos> I know, Mom, soon as I'm out, I'll get back in shape, move around.<eos> No, Lelluccio, you're fine like this, just stay calm.<eos> Then when you're out we'll get moving again.<eos> Just trust your mom, OK?<eos> I do, Mom.
Too bad, because they're going to capture you and eventually kill you and your cute little family.<eos> Alex said you might be able to help get my family out of the country.<eos> Maybe.<eos> What's it gonna take? For the hero of Russia?<eos> 100,000 even.<eos> That's the hero rate?<eos> I've had expenses.<eos> I think Swagger just sent me a message.<eos> You think?<eos> Either he did or he didn't.
This isn't about Swagger.<eos> He thinks he's a hero.<eos> They're impossible to control.<eos> He'll get a Silver Star for what he did today.<eos> And you?<eos> You'll be allowed to serve out this tour.<eos> You'll never get another chance to command troops in the field<eos> Like you have that kind of juice.<eos> I don't.<eos> My boss does.
Animals are drawn to me.<eos> I'm a target.<eos> I'll just...<eos> I'll keep bringing heat to the team.<eos> No. We can handle it.<eos> What about what you said?<eos> About the future?<eos> Do we really want to bring a child into this mess?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
What about what you said?<eos> About the future?<eos> Do we really want to bring a child into this mess?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> You can't answer that quickly.<eos> Before, I was wrong.<eos> But now I have something to fight for.<eos> Unless you don't want to.<eos> I do.
It'll be like that Mother's Day when you were five.<eos> You wanted to make your mom an omelet.<eos> Oh, come on, no omelet analogies.<eos> Indulge me.<eos> I cut the bell peppers, the mushrooms, cracked the eggs.<eos> And you poured everything into the pan and finished the omelet.<eos> - Remember?<eos> - No.<eos> What I do remember is Mom coming downstairs and saying that she was craving pancakes.<eos> She did, didn't she?
How?<eos> Make a distraction.<eos> Uh... ahem. Excuse me, can I get a glass of water, please, sir?<eos> Swallow your spit, boy.<eos> I'm not a boy, actually.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You have eyes, right?<eos> You can tell I'm not a child, and I am definitely not your son, so don't call me "boy."<eos> I'm not sure you realize where you are, boy.<eos> Actually, I do.
No, it's okay.<eos> No, no.<eos> Nobody be alarmed.<eos> Nobody be alarmed, this isn't a real baby.<eos> This baby can't feel a thing, because everything's fake!<eos> God forbid we have real emotion in this show.<eos> What do we got here?<eos> We got a real suitcase.<eos> Finally, we got something real.<eos> Oh, no, we don't!
You know what?<eos> I'm gonna name you.<eos> From now on you'll be known as small dick.<eos> Smalls for short.<eos> Come on, smalls, why you goin' so slow?<eos> Don't you want this?<eos> You want it?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Come on, smalls.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Because it's a secret.<eos> Raimy...<eos> I know what kind of father I've been, okay?<eos> And I know what I've lost.<eos> I lost your mother... and I lost you.<eos> I know what I've lost, okay?<eos> I do, I... and I know what I got to do to get it back.<eos> Dad, please don't go.<eos> Raimy, I know you mean well.<eos> I do.
I haven't heard you play in a while.<eos> Maybe you can bring it with you on the trip?<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> We'll see.<eos> You're excited.<eos> I reckon so.<eos> Don't overdo it out there.<eos> I know my limits.<eos> You worry too much.<eos> No, I don't.
So only if there's an emergency.<eos> So no new news is good then?<eos> Exactly.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Dishes.<eos> You know, I thought it was a good idea when Charlie pitched it.<eos> But now that they're gone.<eos> Aw, honey, don't worry about it.<eos> Charlie knows what he's doing. He does?<eos> Sure, he does.
We'll just...<eos> Oh, we'll just...<eos> Okay.<eos> Will you help me, please?<eos> It's a lost cause now.<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on!<eos> I got it!<eos> Grandpa, help me.<eos> I thought you had it trapped.<eos> I did.
What about you, Dad?<eos> What do you wish Grandad would have done for you?<eos> Why don't we keep it light, huh?<eos> Nah, come on...<eos> I wanna know.<eos> - Nah, Dad... - Tell me.<eos> Really.<eos> Well, I, uh... I really wish that you had read my book.<eos> I've read your book.<eos> - No, you didn't.
Those were your words?<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah?<eos> Well, that's funny 'cause you've never listened to anything that I've said!<eos> - I listened.<eos> - You have never listened to me!<eos> You never listened to me.<eos> You never encouraged me.<eos> - I wanted to be a writer!<eos> - You tried.<eos> Yeah, I did.
- You have never listened to me!<eos> You never listened to me.<eos> You never encouraged me.<eos> - I wanted to be a writer!<eos> - You tried.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> I tried that.<eos> I wanted to be a writer, and you wanted me to be you. Or at least one of your beloved Mustangs.<eos> That's true.<eos> I did.
She... is. She... fractured her pelvis.<eos> Kara's here?<eos> Wait.<eos> Kara was driving the car?<eos> She's pregnant?<eos> You have got to be kidding me!<eos> She had the nerve to show up!<eos> - Kara did this to us?<eos> ! - She said it was an accident.<eos> - Of course she did.
I understand.<eos> All right? Karev is your friend.<eos> He's your... He's your guy.<eos> Things are gonna be awkward enough at work.<eos> Can we just say three weeks?<eos> It's just that my medical bills have been eating up a lot of my savings...<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop.<eos> I don't...<eos> That's not... No, I don't want that.<eos> You don't?
Baby's in the nursery, so I'm here to finally sleep.<eos> Dibs on bottom bunk. Don't you have a bed of your own at home?<eos> Not my home.<eos> I can't day nap there 'cause it's cleaning day, and people are vacuuming and polishing.<eos> It would feel rude.<eos> You're making very little sense.<eos> You know that thing they say about how you're supposed to sleep when the baby sleeps?<eos> That's a lie!<eos> Babies don't sleep. - I'd like to sleep.<eos> - At least my baby doesn't.
Come on!<eos> They're coming.<eos> Shit, they're coming!<eos> We have to go.<eos> Now! They obviously don't catch us, Todd, or they'd remember us in the future from the past, which is currently the present, so...<eos> Right?<eos> What do we do?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - It worked last time.<eos> - No, it didn't!
It's... It's boring.<eos> I just wanted to be in charge, but what they don't tell you is that, once you're in charge, there's all this other, like, blah-bleh-bleh-bleh-bleh, top secret, bleh.<eos> You know what? They can't arrest me.<eos> Like, we're gonna go kill the rest of those body-swapping guys, and it's all, like, top secret, so it's off of books, and all I had to do was write, like, an e-mail.<eos> And then we're gonna go get the, uh, the psychics, too... all the ones that you've been tracking and more.<eos> And they wouldn't let Riggins do it, I guess, but they like me... more... better, because they gave me $80 million.<eos> We have to kill everybody who knows about it.<eos> So... I guess I got to kill you, too. No.<eos> No, you don't have to do that.<eos> You don't, uh...
What are you even talking about?<eos> Get on your knees.<eos> Give me the dog, or I'll kill her!<eos> Give us the her or we'll throw the dog off the bridge!<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm bluffing, but if he shoots her, throw the dog off the bridge.<eos> - Why did you attack us?<eos> - We didn't!<eos> - How do you know who we are?<eos> - We don't.
- Why did you burn my house down?<eos> - I burnt your house down?<eos> - Where's Lydia?<eos> - She's not here.<eos> Bring me the dog.<eos> - Why do you want it?<eos> - Why did you take it?<eos> - We don't know!<eos> - Why did you kill Patrick Spring?<eos> - We didn't.
I'm a rock star!<eos> I'm a rock star...<eos> I'm a rock star...<eos> I have mace.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> You're Lydia Spring.<eos> Are you the one that wrote this letter?<eos> I am.<eos> Do you really have answers?<eos> I do.
It's me.<eos> Good to finally meet you. You said you were attacked.<eos> Yes, so many times.<eos> There's a group of people, some kind of cult or secret organization hunting us.<eos> They said they didn't kill Patrick, but they have Lydia.<eos> They're a key piece in what's happening.<eos> Two of them even came after us while we were trying to dig up the machine.<eos> - Got them both, though. - Yeah.<eos> You killed them?<eos> Well, the shark did, certainly.
When we met? You were right the first time.<eos> Farah!<eos> You're going to have to come with me.<eos> This is lunacy.<eos> You must see that.<eos> Cops showed up at the temple, had to kill one of them.<eos> Should I be expecting more?<eos> You lost your mind when you betrayed Rainey.<eos> The Supreme Soul had a plan for us, for all of us. Oh, really?<eos> Did he, now?
- Ronnie, I'm sorry,<eos> - but we made a decision.<eos> - Why? - Why what?<eos> - Did I stutter?<eos> No.<eos> No, you didn't stutter.<eos> Why'd you make the decision?<eos> - Well...<eos> - Because we landed Benedict Blush for 1.5.<eos> Nick did it.
You make some dumb mistake and ruin everything.<eos> Mistake?<eos> No, this is payday.<eos> And what have I ruined for you?<eos> I have things here, okay?<eos> Things that I don't want to run away from.<eos> And by "things," you mean your cousin's girlfriend?<eos> Don't you understand that if we stay, we risk them finding out everything about us?<eos> Yeah, no, we gotta go.<eos> No, we don't!
Emma and Audrey are on their way to the James farm.<eos> The pig farm?<eos> Did Kieran say why?<eos> No, and Emma won't answer my calls.<eos> Stevens, let's move.<eos> Fabulous.<eos> It's a crumbling, creepy house.<eos> Yeah, there's also a crumbling, creepy barn to match.<eos> It used to belong to the James family.<eos> Or it still does.
No...<eos> No, Kieran...<eos> Tell me that I'm wrong.<eos> Kieran?<eos> You're not wrong.<eos> Emma!<eos> You know... he probably really liked you.<eos> You're a monster.<eos> And the best part is... you just told me you love me.<eos> I did.
- To Baird.<eos> - Thanks, guys!<eos> And thank you, Flynn, for this strange, inappropriate, and ultimately life-saving gift.<eos> Colonel, may I see that?<eos> This is not from Mr. Carson.<eos> This is Mimiko's mirror, a Japanese shaman queen.<eos> It is one of the Library's rarest relics.<eos> How did I end up with it?<eos> Well, you asked earlier if the Guardian guards the Librarians, who guards the Guardians, and there is your answer.<eos> The Library does.
Or maybe a vampire.<eos> What if he's Dracula?<eos> Wait. It's daytime.<eos> Wrong count.<eos> Monte Cristo? Sorry.<eos> Not on the menu. Never a fan of the eggy bread.<eos> No, Granny.<eos> It's a place. And its Count has quite the reputation.<eos> Why would he want to meet with us?<eos> He doesn't.
Then why are you doing this?<eos> Because she has my heart!<eos> Who, Edmond?<eos> Who has your heart?<eos> The Evil Queen.<eos> She can't be.<eos> Yeah, well, it looks like she is.<eos> But it doesn't matter.<eos> We'll find a way to stop her.<eos> We always do.
It might not be permanent, right?<eos> He might get his memories back.<eos> He might.<eos> I've obsessed about this for so long.<eos> But now, the way it went down, I just feel...<eos> You know.<eos> I try not to think about the ones I'm going to catch.<eos> I prefer the think about the ones I'm going to save.<eos> You don't want to catch Peter Lewis?<eos> Of course I do.
You stole Tahani's diary.<eos> I know I broke some ethical rule, but I had good reason.<eos> Eleanor, in order to be a good person, you have to do good things.<eos> And not stealing people's stuff, that is just a basic kindergarten rule.<eos> I mean, do I also have to tell you to not throw sand?<eos> First of all, throwing sand is an excellent way to put out a vodka fire.<eos> Why would you even know that?<eos> Second of all, I know that it may not be nice, but neither is pretending to be 100% perfect, like Tahani does.<eos> - She wrote that note.<eos> - No she didn't!
It destroys their minds, permanently.<eos> What can we do?<eos> Nothing.<eos> The code.<eos> I made it work, it could bring her back.<eos> - I'm coming.<eos> - She'll be gone before you've got here.<eos> We have a minute, maybe less.<eos> Mattie, hack the global uplink network, push the code to all units.<eos> I did it before.
Which means it's one hell of a résumé, am I right?<eos> And how do you know her?<eos> You know, I don't want to know.<eos> So, can you help us?<eos> Is there anything you want to say to me?<eos> You help us out, I'll put in a good word with the judge.<eos> That's not what I'm talking about.<eos> A reduced sentence.<eos> That should wipe the slate clean - between us.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Whenever I did anything he didn't like, he'd always tell me that,<eos> "The Ponaturi's gonna come get you, suck your bones out tonight."<eos> Used to frighten the hell out of me when I was a little kid.<eos> Your grandpa always had a way of taking it too far.<eos> Next you're gonna tell me you saw one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wouldn't be surprised.<eos> Everyone, the Reverend Brother's back!<eos> Devyn brought an outside girl here, and she attracted a flying beast.<eos> No, she didn't.
We knew the columns on Jane's tattoo are consistent with a particular architectural style, but the hidden bullets, that was news to me.<eos> From Jane's perspective, they look almost exactly like .40 caliber rounds.<eos> I cross-referenced the bullets with the building style, and guess what.<eos> The same rounds were used to shoot up the wedding of a Mexico City narcotics officer last year.<eos> Police suspected the Juarez Cartel, but the investigation dried up because detectives kept getting murdered.<eos> That level of violence definitely matches the Juarez M.O.<eos> I tracked down the serial numbers for the guns recovered at the scene.<eos> Three months before the massacre, they were recovered in a raid by the New York DEA.<eos> How does a Mexican cartel steal weapons from the New York DEA?<eos> - They don't.
Empty.<eos> 10.3 grams of antimatter. Perfectly stable.<eos> How close did we come?<eos> I already told you, there's no way of knowing.<eos> It was pretty close, though.<eos> Doctor, I can't emphasize enough how important--<eos> FBI, my ass.<eos> Who are you people?<eos> Blondie over there can't be much over 20, and the technology Beefcake carried in on his shoulder doesn't exist.<eos> Well, obviously, it does.
What the hell did she say to you to make you consider not having a medic on our team?<eos> She didn't have to. I know what she's going through.<eos> Do you?<eos> What happened to "the mission comes first"?<eos> She just needs a little time. I'm sure she'll make the right decision.<eos> You shouldn't have given her the choice.<eos> It's a little more complicated than that, Carly.<eos> Look around.<eos> She has a life in the 21st.<eos> We all do.
Oh, thank God.<eos> Give me the gun.<eos> - Give me the gun!<eos> - What?<eos> Lock the door.<eos> Hey, hey, let her go! Let her go!<eos> I'll shoot!<eos> I'll shoot.<eos> We have a shotgun?<eos> We do now.
Come on. Why don't we try being friends?<eos> Put it away.<eos> I'll make you some coffee.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> By the way, Norm, word of advice...<eos> You had your safety on.<eos> Shit.<eos> I heard something on the radio, but they weren't supposed to hit the Earth.<eos> Well, that one did.
Oh, yeah, that's where I put it.<eos> Oh, I mean, I know you're pregnant.<eos> I just... never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby.<eos> Which MIT did you go to?<eos> Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house!<eos> We don't have a crib, we don't have diapers.<eos> We're not baby-proofed.<eos> Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!<eos> Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.<eos> Do we?
I rewrote the piece myself.<eos> What?<eos> You can't just rewrite my piece.<eos> Actually, Snapper, I can.<eos> 'Cause I'm your boss.<eos> Doesn't feel good to have somebody encroach on your job, does it?<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> I have complete control of editorial content.<eos> No. No, you don't.<eos> I do.
We should know something within the hour.<eos> Yields from the greenhouse are low.<eos> It's been too hot, and it's gonna keep getting hotter.<eos> The solar stills ain't making enough fresh water to keep us on survival rations.<eos> My guys on edge... from the linesmen all the way down to the fish crew.<eos> Everyone's itching for a fight.<eos> Report to me when you got news from Junk City, hmm?<eos> I find out they wasted a flare, I'll personally go down there...<eos> I don't think they would do that.<eos> I really don't...
Get it out of my arm! Stay seated.<eos> Oh!<eos> Hand me another tourniquet.<eos> Oh, uh, here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Karen, those bugs.<eos> Parasite or predator? Parasite.<eos> They were feeding on the corpses.<eos> Only thing we can do is get it out.<eos> Then do it now!
But still, he waits on the Lusitanians.<eos> Without them, Hannibal's favorite kind of war is mobile war.<eos> He's not much given to static warfare.<eos> And the Lusitanian's epitomize mobile warfare.<eos> They're fast, they have light cavalry, they're good at ambushes.<eos> So Hannibal and the Lusitanians are made for each other.<eos> If you're right, and Rome is the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen...<eos> I am right.<eos> Then you'd better have something they don't.<eos> I do.
We take their weapons, we take their land, we take their lives, and still they fight back.<eos> They are a proud people.<eos> Then we will take their pride.<eos> Let the men have him.<eos> When they've finished, cut off his sword-hand and let him go.<eos> If Viriathus unites the tribes?<eos> I cannot go back to Rome without the head of Viriathus.<eos> The head of your ghost, sir?<eos> We don't even know who he is.<eos> Someone does, Marcus.
Leading them is Arminius, a son of Germania, who was raised as a Roman, an enemy on the inside, with a plan to defeat the Empire using its own battle plans, combined with a barbarian guerilla tactics.<eos> Where are my boys?<eos> Where are they?<eos> Where are they?<eos> They've been taken to Rome.<eos> Then they're dead, you bastard!<eos> When they get word of your rebellion in Rome, they will kill them. They were dead anyway.<eos> They would have been taken next year as fodder.<eos> At least this way they have a chance.<eos> Your daughter did not.
Katie, what were you watching?<eos> Right out in the middle, there's this piece of luggage...<eos> I don't know, it's one of these fancy labels, right?<eos> Something...<eos> Whatever, it's nice.<eos> And she goes, "It's stuck," right?<eos> And I just said, "Hey.<eos> How'd it get there?"<eos> - You did not say that.<eos> - I did, I did...
What's a kids' show supposed to do?<eos> Make you feel good, right?<eos> Special hook.<eos> Make you want to live in that world.<eos> That's what "Candle Cove" is all about.<eos> You made this.<eos> Had you, didn't I? It's fan-fic.<eos> It's a love letter.<eos> You don't have the real show?<eos> Nobody does.
And when I'm not...<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Good.<eos> Why is it when bad things happen, we always bring food?<eos> Back then, after they found Jacob, all my friends and neighbors came with casseroles and pies.<eos> You're gonna be all right.<eos> We're survivors.<eos> You still have a son.<eos> And he needs you.<eos> Like sons always do.
10K?<eos> No lobotomy. I don't understand.<eos> Now that we have the technique perfected, this next one should be much easier.<eos> Prep the patient for a bi-cranial trans-orbital resection and lobotomy.<eos> Now hold on!<eos> This is my patient. And I accept full responsibility for him.<eos> He can't just do that, can he? Can he?<eos> Well I have the cure for 10K fever right here.<eos> Well then, if you have this under control...<eos> I do.
It's not a trick question.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No. I just... I'm not used to being the topic of conversation at the table.<eos> Mmm. Well, I think it's time for a lot of things to change around here.<eos> Um... well then, maybe Frida Kahlo.<eos> Kahlo.<eos> Uh, let's see.<eos> She painted The Wounded Deer.<eos> Yeah. Wow.<eos> She did.
-[Bethany] Okay.<eos> Okay, you ready?<eos> [Bethany] Mmm-hmm. [Keith] And now!<eos> [chuckles] It's for you to get around.<eos> -But her legs work fine.<eos> -Oh, come here.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> -Okay. Have a seat.<eos> I think we should let Bethany decide if her legs work or not.<eos> Because they don't.
[laughs] See how you can do it, Mr. Know-it-all.<eos> [Jim] Wrong!<eos> Wrong.<eos> All wrong.<eos> Give me that.<eos> No, all wrong.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I just... I just--<eos> Those were just some sword flourishes that I thought would translate nicely to the flags. But...<eos> -Uh, but they didn't.
We film you swimming in a bathtub full of Slurpees.<eos> Ew, Uncle Jim.<eos> It's not even summer.<eos> Okay, here's one I thought of last night.<eos> A cinnamon challenge.<eos> You know what? Let me stop you there.<eos> I went to that theater and I got myself a gig.<eos> -You did?<eos> Without me?<eos> -Yes, I did! I did!
According to her, another faction from the future.<eos> I don't know about any faction.<eos> Well, neither do I... but apparently, things have changed since we left, and not for the better.<eos> That's not good enough.<eos> It's all I got.<eos> I only know what she told me.<eos> That's a problem.<eos> It doesn't have to be.<eos> - Does it? - Yeah.<eos> It does.
-Detective Galen.<eos> And what did he ask you, Miss Cannonbury?<eos> He asked me what I saw. He asked me about Jacob Appley.<eos> He asked me did I see his face.<eos> He wanted to know if it looked like Appley was looking for Dr. Benton. And then what did Appley do afterwards? Did he just run or was he looking at Dr. Benton on the ground?<eos> And, um, he wanted to know, did I see anyone else there?<eos> Anyone else?<eos> What did he mean by that?<eos> Did I notice anyone odd or different or unusual?<eos> -And did you?
-You know what?<eos> I want you to come with me.<eos> Mother, when you came to see me in the hospital, there was a doctor, he was in the room.<eos> Tell Nina what he looked like.<eos> -A doctor?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> He was talking to me.<eos> Tell Nina.<eos> I don't remember a doctor being there.<eos> Yes, you do.
But Ruben was scared of this fellow?<eos> I was pretty drunk.<eos> I don't remember anything at all.<eos> Just where we met him.<eos> How about you tell us one thing you remember from that night, Sheri?<eos> The beer was the best.<eos> -The Altstadt.<eos> -The Altstadt.<eos> He told me to... well, wait there in that bar.<eos> Uh, but I didn't.
I understood that he died in his own pool.<eos> Sorry. I knew I ate too many cakes.<eos> -Here you go.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> We got some information that he was dealing drugs.<eos> Drugs that came from here.<eos> Does this business have something to do with his death?<eos> You don't sound too surprised.<eos> Are you saying that you knew he was thieving drugs?<eos> Uh, yes. We did.
My wife, she works for a charity.<eos> My conscience is all squared up.<eos> The scales are evened up just the way I like it.<eos> Now people are flawed, I get that.<eos> It's the way of things. But I sleep well at night.<eos> -How about you?<eos> Now I get the feeling that you need chemical aid in that department.<eos> Am I right?<eos> A few days ago we didn't know about Mainline.<eos> Now we do.
What?<eos> So we decided to form this furious four.<eos> Bob, seriously, man, one suggestion?<eos> Shut up.<eos> I mean, the baby is already asleep. Aw.<eos> Enough!<eos> Time for revenge most sweet.<eos> - Uh... - Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said "furious four."<eos> I did.
You're a good dreamer.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I guess.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So I guess you found the guy you were looking for?<eos> In the dream?<eos> You said, "He's here."<eos> Did I?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you?
I know.<eos> You and I are a couple of tough, old dogs.<eos> But we're gonna get through this.<eos> Yeah, life goes on, see.<eos> For both of us.<eos> Has to.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it has to.<eos> It's just so great to see my favorite customer, right back where he belongs.<eos> I always did my best thinking on this stool.
Well, you should.<eos> I'm your Grandpa.<eos> Haven't seen you in almost forever.<eos> Grandpa left town when grandma went to heaven.<eos> I missed you.<eos> Gimme a hug.<eos> Well, um, I know you'll are busy and I'll get out of your way.<eos> You mean, you're not staying for Christmas?<eos> Your grandfather never really liked the holidays.<eos> - I did.
Well, it turns out he knows my father.<eos> I thought he was gonna be a jerk at first, but there's something really sweet about him.<eos> He even offered to do the dishes.<eos> And that makes him what, Prince Charming?<eos> I'm telling you, Chief, you got a pickpocket working main street and you've charged the wrong person.<eos> Do your fishing in Cabo, Foster.<eos> That case was open, and now it's shut.<eos> The wallet was found in the kid's backpack.<eos> Luke Tate didn't steal anything.<eos> Then who did?
It's, like, take this.<eos> I felt it, but it was soft.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> ♪ Yo, you amaze me sometimes ♪<eos> Hey, who here knows how to tap dance?<eos> Thanks.<eos> I have a quick question.<eos> Who here knows how to tap dance?<eos> - I do.
Your daughter was blown up, Mrs. Valera.<eos> I'm saying she lost more than her legs.<eos> Stuff you don't see.<eos> If I hear from her, I'll tell her that you stopped by.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I know where she is.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> I wanted to understand a few things.<eos> You think her father and I gave up on her?<eos> We didn't.
This is the path we've chosen.<eos> Got something.<eos> Where's Deeks?<eos> Ah, he's gonna stop by the hospital to see Kensi on his way in.<eos> How's she doing?<eos> Still unconscious as of last night.<eos> So... do we still have jobs?<eos> Yes.<eos> I mean, I think so.<eos> Don't we?
Look.<eos> Who do you think these women are?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I know somebody who can find out.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh... just practicing my marksmanship.<eos> Why?<eos> So I can qualify with my service weapon.<eos> Well, technical operators don't require a service weapon.<eos> Yeah, but special agents do.
I want my unit back, and I want you to keep Duggan on this side of the Mississippi.<eos> But that doesn't solve your security issues.<eos> That's my resignation.<eos> It's signed and dated 90 days from now.<eos> If we haven't resolved this to your satisfaction by then you won't even have to ask me to leave.<eos> Where's she going?<eos> What, you're letting her go?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I can't believe you let her play you.<eos> She didn't.
Cahill called me. The deal's gonna take a few more days to go through.<eos> And if Gallo even thinks that I'm stringing him along,<eos> Mike may never get out of there at all. I'll clear your schedule.<eos> Hey, I need to talk to you.<eos> Before you do, I just want to say I didn't mean to put it all on you earlier.<eos> No, that doesn't matter now.<eos> Listen. You said that when you got arrested, you turned down a deal to turn on Sutter.<eos> I need to know exactly what they said.<eos> I don't understand what that has to do with Jill.<eos> It doesn't.
You here to bring me bread and water?<eos> If it was up to me, I'd let you starve.<eos> Let me guess: you're here to tell me how much time they're tacking onto my sentence.<eos> Well, it doesn't matter how much. 'Cause I'm gonna get to him, and I'm gonna get to you.<eos> Sorry, Frank, but you're not getting anything tacked onto your sentence.<eos> Your parting gift is going back to the maximum security hellhole you came from.<eos> No way.<eos> You don't have the power to make that happen.<eos> You're right, I don't.<eos> But my friend at the SEC sure does.
You go to that school, you're gonna get infected with their lawyer mind-set and when you come out, you're not gonna give a shit about your fellow man.<eos> If you think that, then you should've spent more time with me.<eos> Because you don't know me at all.<eos> Ms. Pearson?<eos> Ms. Pearson, are you ready?<eos> Mr. Forrest... so many lives were ruined that night.<eos> Your daughter's, her boyfriend's, yours.<eos> Is there a question?<eos> Someone had to pay for that, didn't they?<eos> Yeah, they sure as hell did.
Thank you guys so much.<eos> - Sorry for the imposition.<eos> - Oh, bah. Oh, well, if you want to know the truth, we asked Michael if we could stay with you.<eos> We are obsessed with your relationship.<eos> Always whispering, locking yourself in the house all day.<eos> I thought I was an expert in true love 'cause of my old job, but I have a lot to learn from you guys.<eos> Your job? What was your job?<eos> I was a marriage counselor.<eos> You could say I wrote the book on healthy relationships.<eos> And I did!
Easy targets, no one reports them missing.<eos> But the boy/girl pattern he's established suggests that there might be some kind of fantasy he's trying to perfect.<eos> So what's the fantasy, then?<eos> Is he righting some kind of wrong?<eos> Getting revenge, maybe?<eos> If he has kids of his own, it might have something to do with them.<eos> I can't imagine what would drive a parent to do something like this.<eos> If he's mentally or chemically imbalanced, a tragic life-altering event could have been the trigger.<eos> Pyros like to watch, right?<eos> Yeah, they do.
It's over, Widow.<eos> There's no way out of this one.<eos> Cap, don't make me go out there.<eos> I'm afraid I have no choice.<eos> None of us do.
You Kevin Miller?<eos> Who are you?<eos> -Harvey Specter.<eos> I'm Mike Ross's lawyer.<eos> Look, I already told the warden I didn't see anyone touch his food.<eos> Did you see Frank Gallo with him?<eos> Did you or didn't you?<eos> Are you trying to get me killed, man?<eos> Did he touch his food or not?<eos> Yeah, he did, last night at dinner.
I've left him a dozen messages--<eos> Then leave him a dozen more, and while you're at it, don't leave your desk until he calls back.<eos> - I can't do that.<eos> - Why the hell not?<eos> Because I'm making sure that Louis doesn't blow it with another tenant today.<eos> - Then get Rachel to do that.<eos> - Harvey, Rachel has law school.<eos> And besides that, this is something that I want to do.<eos> Donna, I don't give a shit about Louis and his tenants.<eos> Well, I do.
- Donna, please--<eos> - Flinked the flank? What does flink the flank mean?<eos> It means I'm not finished enjoying this.<eos> When do you think you'll be finished?<eos> Because I need to know what to do.<eos> I don't know. When does their lease expire?<eos> Oh, my God, I cooked in an extension option!<eos> Louis, relax. The important thing to remember here is that this is your fault for not listening to me.<eos> How does that help me?<eos> It doesn't.
I don't care about that.<eos> You asked me to take a chance on you, and now you march in here and tell me you're giving up?<eos> No, no, Mr. Bailey...<eos> You said you would fight for me.<eos> I did fight for you.<eos> Well, then fight goddamn harder!<eos> I'm sorry, and I understand how you feel, but there's just nothing more that I can do.<eos> How do you know what I feel?<eos> You don't know what it's like to be kept away from your loved ones.<eos> - Actually, I do.
I just found out we have less time than I thought we did to get this firm back on its feet, and I can't afford to spend one minute on anything else.<eos> But, I mean, really...<eos> Rachel ...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Now if you'll excuse me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank your counselor, Mr. Rowe.<eos> - I will.<eos> - You must trust him a lot to let him in on your little arrangement.<eos> I do.
It's just...<eos> I'm just saying she's not you.<eos> - Who is?<eos> - Nobody.<eos> Was this the kind of thing you're looking for?<eos> Oh, my God, it's perfect.<eos> Is it still available?<eos> - An offer went in this morning.<eos> - We have to beat it.<eos> No, Louis, we don't.
I'm looking for.<eos> Did you find Maria?<eos> You know, I haven't even started looking for her yet, because you lied to me.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't lie to you about shit.<eos> Well, you certainly didn't tell me that you and Maria were high the night of those murders.<eos> - Who told you that?<eos> - Georgina Casey.<eos> You went to see my old lawyer?<eos> Yes, I did.
A lot of manpower has been devoted to your pursuit of this virtual stranger. And by manpower, I mean my precious time.<eos> So I think it's time that you took care of this yourself.<eos> Goddamn it. Don't you think if I could have I would have?<eos> What I think is, if you can't figure out how to have a simple date with a woman who's already agreed to go out with you, then maybe you don't deserve to go out with her in the first place.<eos> How's that for advice?<eos> Harvey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What do you mean what am I doing here?<eos> I need to know if you have anything yet.<eos> - I don't.
I'll take care of it, Louis.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - That's my guy.<eos> - Your guy?<eos> My private investigator.<eos> Why doesn't it say it on the card?<eos> Because a guy that good isn't in the phone book.<eos> Listen, Rachel, when you get to a certain level, everybody has their person.<eos> Harvey has Vanessa, I have Carter.<eos> And now I do too.
Exactly. And if you do this for me, I will owe you one.<eos> Rachel, you're my daughter.<eos> You'll never owe me one.<eos> Mm-mm. I'm not here as your daughter.<eos> I'm here as a lawyer.<eos> Then don't forget this.<eos> Because someday, I'm gonna come calling.<eos> Mike, sit down.<eos> I hope you didn't come all the way down here just to tell me that we're running out of time, 'cause I already know that.<eos> I didn't.
Previously on "Suits"...<eos> Your execution date has been set.<eos> - When?<eos> - 30 days.<eos> You said you were gonna find Maria.<eos> You have one week to find a witness. After that, his execution date is set in stone.<eos> We found the guy who's been feeding Sutter his information.<eos> Phillip Allen. I know.<eos> He came by to cut a deal two hours ago, so I gave him one.<eos> - No you goddamn didn't.
Come on.<eos> All right, yeah.<eos> I don't think this was a random attack.<eos> These are CRs filed against Platt.<eos> The top two are lawsuits she's racked up.<eos> We think she knows her assailant.<eos> A guy came in the district last week, made threats.<eos> I want to know why, and I want to know who, and fast.<eos> Sergeant, you know we got those new cameras installed downstairs?<eos> We do?
I didn't do anything.<eos> Yeah? Then why did you run?<eos> Stay down!<eos> Who is this?<eos> Who'd you text?<eos> Huh?<eos> "Police." Is Leonard Milwood here?<eos> He's talking to you.<eos> I don't have to talk to you.<eos> Yeah, you sure do.
You see, Regina never had her happy ending because she's never been strong enough to let her story run its course.<eos> I won't make that mistake, mnh-mnh, for myself... or our new arrivals.<eos> What about those people?<eos> What do you want with them?<eos> Patience.<eos> You just wait until those untold stories play out.<eos> But here's a little spoiler.<eos> Cinderella's story won't end well.<eos> Why would you want to hurt Ashley?<eos> I don't.
No criminal record, but the last few weeks, he suddenly appears all over Tyler's social media profile.<eos> Mouse, you dump his phone records?<eos> Yeah, there's dozens of calls between Tyler and Tony Chin, all less than two minutes in duration and at all sorts of crazy hours.<eos> Have Atwater and Ruzek take a run at this guy.<eos> You know, Tyler... he was 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine.<eos> - When?<eos> - '08.<eos> He was spitting distance from us in Kandahar.<eos> All right, well, they saw some action.<eos> Yeah, they did.
Burrows says it's terrible branding.<eos> But either way, this is a battle for hearts and minds.<eos> - What can I do?<eos> - Facts, Simmons.<eos> I need cold, hard, scientific facts to back up our case during this debate.<eos> I can put together a PowerPoint on, um, Inhuman genetics, biology, sociological impact...<eos> Yeah, here's the thing.<eos> I think it might be better if I literally had what's in your head... in my head.<eos> Even S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't have that kind of technology.<eos> Oh, sure it does.
"A team that trusts is a team..."<eos> Don't.<eos> Robbie.<eos> Hey, what's up, man?<eos> Look, uh, sorry about all the drama.<eos> I'm just glad to see you're safe.<eos> Me?<eos> What about you, disappearing like that?<eos> I thought you trusted me.<eos> Well, I do.
He bent down to check on you.<eos> And then you moved.<eos> That's when I knew you were alive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> Well, the first part is like you said.<eos> The fire, the chase, the shooting.<eos> But what I remember most is feeling like I screwed up... that because of me, you were going to die.<eos> We both were.<eos> We didn't.
Quake was here the entire time.<eos> But she was not responsible for the danger here today.<eos> Agent Johnson... saved us all.<eos> Just go with it.<eos> You'll thank me later.<eos> We need to get this to Gabe.<eos> Belongs to him now.<eos> I wouldn't count out the previous owner just yet.<eos> You think Robbie will make it back?<eos> The last Ghost Rider did.
Elizabeth, someone is stalking our family.<eos> How could a former student who is obsessed with you not be relevant?<eos> He just wanted me to be his thesis advisor.<eos> He wanted you to be a lot more than that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Admittedly, Ray got a little weird.<eos> - A lit...<eos> - And don't say,<eos> "He got a lot more than that."<eos> - Well, he did.
He just wanted me to be his thesis advisor.<eos> He wanted you to be a lot more than that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Admittedly, Ray got a little weird.<eos> - A lit...<eos> - And don't say,<eos> "He got a lot more than that."<eos> - Well, he did.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> He did.
So you're telling me we owe this game-changing intelligence coup to a lucky break from Scooby and the gang?<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> And if the launcher is already there, the missiles are only days away from delivery.<eos> This is a massive escalation.<eos> And China needs to know that it won't stand.<eos> Madam Secretary, I don't know where you're getting this information.<eos> From the server you tried to destroy.<eos> But we'll come back to the cyber warfare another time.<eos> You've got bigger problems right now.<eos> Do I?
Just like we didn't think they were in Rome.<eos> Let's check with DEA.<eos> See if we can trace this back to the seller.<eos> Susan.<eos> I'm sorry to disrupt your schedule, Madam Secretary.<eos> N-No, no, no.<eos> I'm-I'm sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> The...fallout from Rome has been getting all the attention.<eos> - You know how that goes.<eos> - I do.
And luckily for you,<eos> I wasn't interested in what she was offering.<eos> Resisting the darkness?<eos> This is a new you.<eos> Is there something you want?<eos> Jekyll has a head start on you with a new serum, one that can destroy Hyde for good this time.<eos> He just needs your help.<eos> Rise and shine!<eos> Well, well, someone had quite the night.<eos> I did?
Detective Lutz, Detective Ortiz.<eos> Hello, detective.<eos> Nice meeting you.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Nice meeting you.<eos> Please, please sit down.<eos> All right.<eos> So what is this about, detectives?<eos> Mr. Lawson, do you know Hassan Ali?<eos> Yes, I do.
Baby, let's go.<eos> It's okay.<eos> A little further.<eos> Can you give that to me again please?<eos> Can you just give that to me one time, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey. Yeah, I do understand.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, I do.
He doesn't just have people killing for him, he has them sending him pictures, evidence of his work.<eos> That is a highly sophisticated form of manipulation.<eos> The government of Hawaii has empowered us to do whatever is necessary to, uh, to catch whoever's responsible.<eos> So I need you to tell me what it's gonna take for you to come and work for us, temporarily, of course.<eos> I'm sorry, Commander, but I'm...<eos> I'm retired.<eos> Do you understand that innocent people are dead?<eos> Innocent people with families.<eos> That's got to mean something to you.<eos> It does.
If they look like you... sure.<eos> Well, let me cut to the chase.<eos> I have your diamonds.<eos> If you want them back then meet me on the patio in two minutes.<eos> I misjudged you.<eos> You're not confident, you're stupid.<eos> You think you can come down here and shake me down?<eos> And here I was thinking that we'd have some time to ourselves.<eos> You never said to come alone.<eos> No, I didn't.
It's working itself out.<eos> Thank you for asking.<eos> How is Mr. Walters?<eos> George is a tough son of bitch.<eos> - So is cancer. So it goes. - Yeah.<eos> Well, I have seen the place about a dozen times, but let's make it official.<eos> Right.<eos> You brought the Pope.<eos> I brought the Pope.<eos> Well, the Second City First Committee did.
Can you please stop doing that?<eos> This is not your home.<eos> You came and begged me for help with a case of demonic possession, and now you got your knickers in a twist 'cause I didn't bring you flowers?<eos> I don't actually know you.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> There are stages to a demonic possession, my friend.<eos> Right now, my guess... the demon's gone possum.<eos> Gathering its strength, waiting to show its ratty little teeth.<eos> And when it does...
Hi.<eos> It's Sabine.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Hey.<eos> I've been calling and... you've not been answering, so I... figured I'd leave another message.<eos> I just...<eos> I wanna explain...<eos> I screwed up. And that's on me, but... and...<eos> I know I should've thought of you more.<eos> I do.
You fill out this little bitch-ass prescription.<eos> Holler at me tomorrow, motherfucker."<eos> That's the right doctor for me.<eos> I don't want my doctor to be some bratty Indian kid who grew up in Mississauga.<eos> When he's doing an operation, he just goes, "Fuck this shit.<eos> I wanna play guitar."<eos> Then the black guy has to run in, "Don't worry, dog.<eos> It's gonna hurt and shit."<eos> I never had to worry about doing anything great with my life.<eos> I didn't.
Show him out, boys, and make sure he bleeds.<eos> Yeah, not the best idea.<eos> But right now, we need a distraction.<eos> no one, I mean no one, likes a bar fight better than me, but you just blew up half the bar with us in it.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> You're gonna kill us before marco does. That's a brilliant plan.<eos> Come on!<eos> what?<eos> You told me to wait in the car.<eos> Technically, I did.
D-77?<eos> Heard stories about them in prison.<eos> They're like mercenaries or something, right?<eos> MacGYVER: Terrorists for hire.<eos> Ex-insurgents and extremists who traded in their politics for cold hard cash.<eos> They're highly trained and very careful.<eos> Every member hidden by multiple false identities.<eos> Every expense paid for by shell corporations.<eos> - So how do we find these guys?<eos> - We don't.
Let's just take a seat.<eos> - Come on, there you go.<eos> - Where do... Hey, you're really tall.<eos> Where did you go?<eos> What's the emergency, Mr. Schott?<eos> Is she drunk?<eos> Mon-El took me to happy hour.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> He knows how to drink drinks.<eos> Of course he does.
I don't know what that means.<eos> I mean... Um...<eos> I started to... Develop feelings... For her.<eos> Feelings?<eos> Like...<eos> Yeah, those... Those feelings.<eos> So, Maggie thought that I should... Tell you.<eos> And so I did.<eos> I just...<eos> I just did.
Uh... DEO's reporting an alien attacking civilians in an alleyway downtown.<eos> I'll go get the alien.<eos> You get the girl.<eos> Hold it!<eos> Mon-El?<eos> Ah, okay, before you say anything, you should know that this gentleman here...<eos> Stand up, Brian.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> Brian here has a bad habit of not paying back his debts promptly.<eos> I do.
Guardian, huh?<eos> Not bad, could have been better.<eos> Look, I want to help people, and what better says that than Guardian?<eos> You did pretty good out there last night.<eos> Taking down the Purple People Eater.<eos> Not too bad, yourself, man in the van.<eos> You want to keep on doing this, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - So do you.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
This place is...<eos> Exotic.<eos> You know, for a place that caters to aliens, they have some pretty good chicken wings.<eos> How do you know that's chicken?<eos> The latest in a series of armored truck robberies was thwarted last night when National City's newest crime fighter took a stand.<eos> The new guy.<eos> Of course.<eos> Guardian?<eos> I thought you said he helped you.<eos> He did...
Tonight you'll join us.<eos> Oh, will I?<eos> Perhaps after a year-and-a-half, you might be open to a new method.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Illinois Compiled Statutes.<eos> Emergency Admission by Certification, Section 3.610, right here.<eos> "Not later than 24 hours, the respondent," that's Casey,<eos> "shall be examined a second time by a psychiatrist,"<eos> and that didn't happen.<eos> - Mom, it did. - No.
Emma, I really don't think chasing a bird is an effective form of therapy. Last time, he took me to the Oracle.<eos> He'll do it again.<eos> She knows what's going on with my visions.<eos> She says she knows, but I can actually help you.<eos> This is not dream interpretation.<eos> Emma, this is the opposite of how therapy's supposed to work.<eos> - I mean, we're... we're making progress.<eos> - Well, I don't see it. My hands are still shaking and the visions are still haunting me despite all the hours on the couch.<eos> So no more talking.<eos> Today we do something.
He knows her.<eos> It's too easy to pass up.<eos> Okay, well, that's your opinion.<eos> You have a better one?<eos> Or maybe you listen to me and find him.<eos> Oh, sure, yeah.<eos> I'm just gonna go make a call.<eos> Goff has been AWOL for 20 years on my end, and I am the one dealing with the fact that this psycho beat and strangled Mom.<eos> Everybody wants a memorial for her. They want to mourn her.<eos> Of course they do.
It's always the job, right?<eos> You know I get it.<eos> You know, I'm under the same kind pressure, but, Frank, it's been two years of<eos> "Daddy will be home for Christmas." He'll be here for your birthday when you're seven, or when you're eight.<eos> Maybe you just shouldn't make promises.<eos> No, I want her with me.<eos> I want her to stay here with me.<eos> You know what she said when she got home last night?<eos> "Everybody needs to stop lying to me. I'm not a baby anymore."<eos> Of course she did.
Man, from your lips to God's ears.<eos> Bagels here suck.<eos> Got to try Stein's, best in the South.<eos> Suit at the cleaners?<eos> Casual Tuesdays.<eos> No Percy?<eos> No, she had to go home.<eos> Thank you. Stepfather's sick.<eos> Didn't think they got along.<eos> They don't.
Are you crazy?<eos> You can't put that on Snapchat.<eos> Fine, I'll put it on Facebook like a caveman.<eos> You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer.<eos> That's not a bad idea.<eos> Well, you must have someone in your family that's a lawyer. Why?<eos> Because I'm Jewish?<eos> That's like me saying, "Hey, you're Indian.<eos> Doesn't your cousin work in a call center?"<eos> My cousin does work in a call center.
I feel terrible.<eos> Is it even possible to get this done in two months?<eos> Well, maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> We'll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week.<eos> Which means I won't be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and she'll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage.<eos> I love your French toast.<eos> Oh, thanks, man.<eos> So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?<eos> We didn't. Sheldon did.
Um, when was the last time you saw this "Big Earl"?<eos> 1961.<eos> We were sweethearts.<eos> But I went to Havana to visit my family and to bring Earl back some cigars.<eos> Then the revolution came and the rest is communism.<eos> Earl's got people hunting him down across time and space, and I can't get a second date?<eos> Earl!<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> I recognize that swagger.<eos> She does?
I took over his desk.<eos> Belardo made the error of leaving these letters at the back of a drawer.<eos> - Have you read them all?<eos> - Only the pertinent passages.<eos> The steamy ones. The ones that prove that Belardo has had a woman for years.<eos> You should have read them all, and with care.<eos> In this last one, he states he'll never send these letters to that woman because he's married to God.<eos> Do you have any evidence that they were mailed?<eos> Any envelopes with canceled stamps?<eos> No, no, I don't.
So long, Ma.<eos> Your Holiness, don't you feel well?<eos> No, no.<eos> Just a passing discomfort.<eos> - Should I call the doctor? - No, no, it's nothing serious.<eos> It's over.<eos> Are you certain you don't want me to call the doctor?<eos> All better now.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> I... yes, I do.
Not a great salesman.<eos> Let's park this thing so I can show you the inside.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> We have lit candles in here.<eos> Han's with a girl?<eos> Oh, ho, that is one magic car.<eos> You know what that means.<eos> Even Han got sex before Caroline.<eos> Who had 32 years for Han in the pool?<eos> Uh, I did.
I understand how angry you are with Keen for doing what she did...<eos> Yes, and that is part of why I'm leaving, but it's not just that.<eos> It...<eos> It's this place.<eos> You never know where you stand with anyone... whether they'll be there for you when you need them.<eos> If there's anything I can do to get you to reconsider, you let me know.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> You're a good partner.<eos> I wish there was.<eos> I really do.
When is the last time you saw him?<eos> I think it was in the summer.<eos> Not this summer.<eos> Last summer.<eos> You called him Time Clock?<eos> That was a joke name we gave him on account of he was always talking about his job.<eos> Wait, he works?<eos> Nah.<eos> Don't know where he went to, but it wasn't a real job.<eos> Did it every single day, though.
We just do what we do.<eos> Follow our instincts.<eos> Right over there's where you brought us.<eos> Remember?<eos> I swear, you've got the wrong person.<eos> In the morning, as soon as the light got in, you took the pigs one by one.<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> FBI!<eos> Drop the weapon now!<eos> Do it now!
I would, uh...<eos> I'd choose L.A., also.<eos> Oh, snap!<eos> Watch and learn, because Sam and Callen are two of the best.<eos> Obviously, behind Hetty and Granger and myself.<eos> Kensi, whoa, Kensi's the best.<eos> Do not mess with her, because she can do good cop, bad cop all by herself.<eos> She just uses her good eye and then her weird eye.<eos> She probably freaks people out with that thing.<eos> She does.
And you thought this wasn't gonna be a great party.<eos> You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school.<eos> Well, it's not exactly like it.<eos> We're all extremely smart.<eos> Wow... you popular girls are mean.<eos> I'm gonna get some coffee. You want some?<eos> Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?<eos> Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem.<eos> I do. You don't.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
The things that you've seen.<eos> Honestly, I... felt like a nobody.<eos> And then one night, I met Jack.<eos> And the next morning, it was all different.<eos> Like a roller coaster.<eos> You ever wake up one day and not recognize your own life?<eos> Es, actually.<eos> A lot lately.<eos> And now I never know what's going to happen next.<eos> I really don't.
So if you saw him, if you can give a description of him, this is gonna help a lot of people out, okay?<eos> I didn't see anything.<eos> What about what he was wearing?<eos> - Can you remember what he wa...<eos> - Hey, Frank.<eos> She didn't see anything, okay?<eos> What else do you want?<eos> Go on, Eva.<eos> You seem like a good guy.<eos> You do.
- I should have told you sooner.<eos> He took my mom only six months after he took your mother.<eos> So then you know what it's like.<eos> The loss.<eos> It drowns you.<eos> I used to pray every day, hoping somehow she was still alive, being kept somewhere.<eos> I used to dream about it.<eos> But now, after this, I hope she died quick.<eos> I feel like when we were little you told me you saw his face.<eos> Did I?
It's pretty hard.<eos> Not for me.<eos> - See?<eos> I got "up here" skills. Ow.<eos> - [Thunk] Yeah. And when you add this new math skill to your other two hunting skills, that'll be...<eos> - Ten skills!<eos> - [Eep and Thunk] Three skills.<eos> Right, three.<eos> I meant to say three.<eos> Sure you did, Dad.
Not for me.<eos> - See?<eos> I got "up here" skills. Ow.<eos> - [Thunk] Yeah.

Splarg and Splorg?<eos> Who are they, and why are they hogging all the food?<eos> - Uh, they're not real people.<eos> - Wh... What?<eos> - How can not-real people hold eggs?<eos> - The eggs also aren't real.<eos> Then what are we even talking about?<eos> Handprint, please.<eos> Okay, you have three smashfruit.<eos> I do?
Glorious.<eos> See how amazing I made them sound?<eos> Uh, next scream.<eos> ♪ Give up, you stupid feather head ♪<eos> ♪ We will scream until you're dead ♪<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're supposed to scare it, not entertain it.<eos> [gasping] [screaming] Why did you teach those kids those useless, beautiful sounds?<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> Or do, but not like that.
If they're gray, eat away."<eos> So close, but it's actually,<eos> "If they're gray, you'll get violently ill today."<eos> That's not nearly as catchy.<eos> It's not funny.<eos> Stop laughing!<eos> [snickering] It was a trick question.<eos> They're all poison.<eos> [grunting] [screaming] You have nothing to be afraid of.<eos> Of course I do.
Fine.<eos> Then from now on, you can be in charge of you on that side.<eos> This is my side.<eos> You stay out of it.<eos> Happy to.<eos> My side's got more sunshine.<eos> Well, my side's got better clouds.<eos> - My side's got Womp.<eos> - Yay!<eos> - My side doesn't.
Love makes you go number one.<eos> No!<eos> Don't stop!<eos> Hunters are coming!<eos> [Grug] We are right on your tail... [stammers] wherever you are!<eos> Fine, fine, you did your thing.<eos> Now let's, uh...<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> Move!<eos> Do it for true love!
No, no, we're not stopping now.<eos> Trust me, I know what's best and fun is just around the corner.<eos> [shrieking] Okay, a different corner.<eos> [everyone] Are we there yet?<eos> No.<eos> [groans] Do you even know where "there" is?<eos> Next question.<eos> Admit it.<eos> You don't know where we're going, it's dark, and we don't even have a place to sleep!<eos> Sure we do.
You sold me out.<eos> You had them send some goon to threaten me and my family.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I'd never do that.<eos> You're like a son to me.<eos> Now, for you to think that I would...<eos> I don't know what to think of you.<eos> Well, now you know what they're capable of.<eos> You have to cooperate.<eos> We both do.
We can't hold 'em off much longer.<eos> We almost got 'em all out.<eos> You all need to hightail it now.<eos> You gotta come with us.<eos> You just be sure to tell everybody I fought off a thousand of 'em.<eos> One-handed.<eos> Get. He has to take this letter to General Houston.<eos> John Smith is gonna be the first mayor of San Antonio.<eos> - You have to deliver this.<eos> - The hell I do.
Yeah, it also means that whoever did this knows exactly what they're doing.<eos> No, what is she doing?<eos> Why, what's up?<eos> Never mind.<eos> But I gotta go.<eos> Hey, fill in Pride on what you found out, all right?<eos> Uh... okey-dokey.<eos> And that's Scott Hamilton...<eos> I wish I could help you, I do, but I don't know how.<eos> Yes, you do, Dana.
I hit Dana's e-mails and text messages with some Triple P-grade hacking of my own.<eos> Turns out, she's not just the advance coordinator for the races, she's the advance planner for the robberies.<eos> Well, it makes sense.<eos> Advance coordinators go to the next town a week ahead of each race.<eos> That's plenty of time to prep for the next heist, and it's a perfect cover, too.<eos> And that text indicates that they're planning a hit today, in our town.<eos> You know where?<eos> She left the location out of the digiverse.<eos> You think they took Dana to pull off - one more heist?<eos> - If they did, then they did it by force.
What is it?<eos> The op's been blown.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means trouble.<eos> We need to go to your suite.<eos> For what?<eos> Just being cautious.<eos> Hey, Mac.<eos> I thought you said this train was nonstop.<eos> I did.
Can we not do this right now?<eos> They're heading towards her suite.<eos> - Let's go say hi.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Riley, stay here.<eos> Watch our backs.<eos> You're our eyes and ears now.<eos> And what am I supposed to do if those guys find Katarina before you find them?<eos> You don't know martial arts, do you?<eos> No, of course you don't.
That sounds awesome!<eos> Let's do this!<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Now what?<eos> Now we, uh...<eos> We go back to Plan "A".<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said that Plan "A"<eos> could kill everybody on board the train.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Just wait till he's governor.<eos> Allie...<eos> Allie! He's lying.<eos> Why don't you let me talk to him alone?<eos> No.<eos> This whole alpha male pissing contest isn't helping, Kurt.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> He's not gonna open up with you there.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He just did.
She must be activating the bug software that's messing with the Penter server!<eos> Penter server?<eos> Something's messing with the election.<eos> Well, things just got a lot more complicated, because that woman is Sophia Vasquez...<eos> It's the president's chief of staff.<eos> All right, Happy, you're certain you stopped the footage at exactly 7:13?<eos> I know what seven, one and three look like.<eos> Okay, if the president's chief of staff downloaded that bug, and the president sent the FBI to get us to fix the server...<eos> How do we know Backside, Fart and Go-Smell-Me aren't in on this?<eos> We don't.
It's true.<eos> It's not a book for children, and it's not a book for morons.<eos> The book is published in 1970.<eos> You were equipping people with this knowledge to do what?<eos> I'm...<eos> Yeah, I don't think that...<eos> I don't think I hoped they would do anything with it, quite frankly.<eos> "This is a book for anarchists... "those who feel able to discipline themselves "on all the subjects, from drugs to weapons, to explosives."<eos> I don't think the book actually says, "This is what you should do with this information."<eos> In fact, it doesn't.
There was some of that in the thing I had to drink to find Aladdin.<eos> And you kiss me with that mouth?<eos> Let's get this up to Henry so he can pack the Bug before the new tenant comes.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, Hang on, hang on.<eos> Look at me, look at me.<eos> You're worried about your parents, and that's making this worse, but they're gonna be all right.<eos> They're gonna find that magic little baby tree thing and defeat the Evil Queen.<eos> They're gonna find that magic little tree thing?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> What if they don't?
Federal agents!<eos> On the ground!<eos> Put your hands up!<eos> I got him.<eos> Hands behind your head.<eos> Look out!<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm good.<eos> We have a problem?<eos> No, we don't.
Yeah.<eos> I know, totally.<eos> - Cliché, right?<eos> I always hated playing this game.<eos> - Uh...<eos> What?<eos> You liked it more than I did.<eos> I did not like it more than you.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I didn't.
- It appears that way, sir.<eos> - But we have a location for them.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> This ELT signal's an older model.<eos> Analog frequency. No digital signal to carry GPS coordinates.<eos> ELTs are notoriously unreliable, especially if they're... submerged underwater.<eos> We've narrowed the search field to 220 square miles.<eos> SAR teams are gearing up now.<eos> I know this is not about me, it is about Agent Keen, but I don't know if I have the strength to lose her again.<eos> None of us do.
Any visual?<eos> Still no movement.<eos> Standing by.<eos> Thank you for doing this, Samar.<eos> I can't tell you how much I appreciate it. Come on, Liz.<eos> We're not gonna do this now.<eos> She hates me.<eos> Uh, yes. For now.<eos> She needs time.<eos> We all do.

Perhaps another go with the candiru fish.<eos> I understand they burrow into the most impossible nooks and crannies.<eos> All right, I-- I give him blood transfusions once a month.<eos> And, uh... weekly erythropoietin injections.<eos> When did you last see him?<eos> - Six days ago.<eos> Then you'll be seeing him within the next 24 hours.<eos> Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No, I-I-I don't.
Where's my money?<eos> I'm working on it, but that amount of money takes time.<eos> "Better than he deserves."<eos> What did you mean by that?<eos> You ever invented anything?<eos> You ever experience that moment of discovery?<eos> It's a revelation.<eos> And the man you shot?<eos> Will never know what that feels like.<eos> But I do.
I thought it was a solar aircraft module.<eos> I was planning to calibrate the tracking algorithm at home.<eos> You can't do that at school?<eos> I wrote some code that doesn't run on the lab computers.<eos> Solar aircraft, for the military?<eos> It's a civilian project.<eos> Okay, then why would Chapman keep it in a secure lab?<eos> You'd have to ask him that.<eos> Or, more importantly, how did you get into a secured lab?<eos> I didn't.
He was doing charity work in Afghanistan, giving medical care, when he was killed by a U.S. drone strike.<eos> I'm very sorry to hear that.<eos> So this is about revenge?<eos> No.<eos> It's about survival.<eos> My family only receives $120 a month in benefits.<eos> They're living in poverty.<eos> They're starving.<eos> And they deserve much better.<eos> Yes, they do.
Yep.<eos> How many coats in there with you? Shoes?<eos> Boxes?<eos> It's dark in there.<eos> Give me one second. I just wouldn't have pegged him for claustrophobia.<eos> Six months of solitary can do that to you.<eos> Solitary?<eos> How would you know that?<eos> León likes to talk.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Well, I'm not on your team.<eos> Besides, Owen said day one there's no such thing as team in the CIA.<eos> But... how would you feel about second place?<eos> You're helping me?<eos> Why?<eos> Because I like you.<eos> And unlike everyone else, you don't lie about who you are.<eos> How are we gonna win?<eos> They told us to leave our phones there.<eos> I did.
I come bearing office-warming gifts.<eos> Oh, that is so nice. Thank you.<eos> So, how's it going?<eos> Weird.<eos> Yeah? It started with the I'm gonna hurl first day jitters, but now there's this.<eos> I was able to increase the budget to hire a new agent.<eos> That's great.<eos> Yeah. Anyway, what's up?<eos> I was just checking to see if we had a case.<eos> We don't.
He want them to patch things up so they can be a family again, and, today, Gabriel is flying in.<eos> Him and Tara have agreed to meet at a coffee shop.<eos> They're going to swallow their pride and maybe, just maybe, they will put the past behind them.<eos> Sweet, right?<eos> Yeah, it's really...<eos> No, it's terrible, because what if he asks for money?<eos> What if she can't say no?<eos> What if she gets caught up in his whirlwind of manipulation?<eos> Did she put it that way?<eos> No, I did.
Ok, you know what?<eos> You guys, I thought you were my friends.<eos> But you suck.<eos> You all suck.<eos> Especially you, new guy.<eos> But then you always suck.<eos> Newbie.<eos> I had 14 hours. I think I win, right?<eos> Uh, who had 11?<eos> Oh, I did.
The pictures are obviously of Gabriel at different ages, but normally one would arrange them in chronological or reverse chronological order.<eos> 15, 11, and 32 is a pattern that he wants us to see.<eos> Not us.<eos> Tara. It's a pattern he wants her to see.<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> I remember this.<eos> His 32nd birthday party.<eos> His sixth grade graduation.<eos> He made the Honor Roll that year.<eos> Yeah. He did every year.
Take your pick.<eos> That punk had problems with everyone in the school.<eos> How many had problems with him?<eos> What, you're looking for a list or something?<eos> His death wasn't accidental.<eos> He was poisoned.<eos> Well, then you got your work cut out for you.<eos> Everyone had problems with that kid.<eos> Abbs, McGee said you had something for me.<eos> Yup. Yup, I do.
I made a 3D avatar of you, using NCIS security camera footage.<eos> And the hairs slowly went up on Agent Quinn's neck.<eos> Oh, no, no! I just...<eos> I needed to know your sizes, because... I'm knitting you a "Welcome to NCIS" sweater.<eos> But until it's done, welcome... to NCIS.<eos> Well, thank you very much.<eos> Do you want a tour?<eos> I do, uh, but later, 'cause Gibbs wanted me to...<eos> He wants to find out where the earring came from.<eos> Of course he does.
So, if he wants to keep his family together, he's doing the right thing.<eos> I mean, I get how rewarding it is to be a war-zone doctor.<eos> Go to those places no one else will.<eos> Sweep in, save lives, sweep out.<eos> Yeah, but Annie's only six.<eos> She deserves a father.<eos> We figured out how to balance our lives, right?<eos> So can he.<eos> The fact that he wants to turn things around says a lot.<eos> Yeah, it does.
That's a...<eos> That's a big earthquake, right?<eos> Where?<eos> - Venezuela.<eos> - Yeah, that's huge.<eos> Everything's been knocked out.<eos> There's no communication.<eos> There hasn't been much upkeep on the infrastructure there, but a quake that size could be devastating.<eos> Do we have an embassy in Caracas?<eos> Yeah, we do.
I know.<eos> I know, you're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We're all a little on edge.<eos> And I can see how this would be a little more sensitive for you.<eos> I know Carla Alvarez.<eos> Did you know her well?<eos> I'd see her when Vincent and I visited down there.<eos> Arabelle doesn't know I ever went to the ranch.<eos> Unless she does.
Actually, we've been doing a little bit of experimenting, Hammond.<eos> I've made a prototype.<eos> This is a gearstick with a jet knob on the top.<eos> It's brilliant.<eos> I mean, it's not polished yet, but you change gear.<eos> It does make your hand a bit dirty.<eos> But, no, that's a handy reminder. It is.<eos> Exactly.<eos> No, you're absolutely right 'cause you know, sometimes you drive an unfamiliar car, you're on the motorway and you think, "Oh, did I change into sixth?<eos> Yeah, I did."
Everyone was going, "When will you make it?"<eos> "We're not.<eos> It's just to show you what we could make."<eos> Why did they show us?<eos> - Just don't do that!<eos> - Yeah, exactly.<eos> Actually, no, it doesn't matter, because they've come up with something else instead.<eos> This look.<eos> This is actually an homage to the original 2002, which is the old car on the left, and that, I think, actually looks pretty fab.<eos> -It does.
rubbish. It's undriveable.<eos> You know, it's a very good point, because a racing car on the road is a bit like trying to play tennis with a cricket bat.<eos> It's technically possible...<eos> Two totally different disciplines.<eos> The only trouble is, that looks so good, I do find myself going...<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for reminding me, Hammond.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> -Did that go well for you?<eos> -No, it didn't.
It's technically possible...<eos> Two totally different disciplines.<eos> The only trouble is, that looks so good, I do find myself going...<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for reminding me, Hammond.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> -Did that go well for you?<eos> -No, it didn't.<eos> -Oh, did it not?<eos> -No, it didn't.
Now, what we've got here, I think, is a really rather effective parking sensor.<eos> What?<eos> I don't like this!<eos> - I like it.<eos> I like it.<eos> You get back in.<eos> We'll bring a car in so that...<eos> Yeah, so you've got something to reverse up to.<eos> I need to drill some holes for your eyes.<eos> - You bloody don't!
So, I, uh...<eos> I know that you and Thanksgiving have a... somewhat of a spotty past, but, um...<eos> I wanted you to know that no matter what happens this year, you're gonna make it to the pie.<eos> Hey, Kevin.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh...<eos> I was just kind of wondering if... maybe this year, I could wear the hat?<eos> Oh, you want to wear the hat?<eos> Yeah, I do.
And then whoever's turn it is, is going to pull on this yarn and then throw it to the next person.<eos> Okay.<eos> I am thankful... for my family.<eos> I'm thankful that we're all safe.<eos> And... there's no one in the world I'd rather be too hot or too cold with.<eos> I am thankful for my family.<eos> I am thankful that everyone's safe.<eos> And there is no one in the whole world I'd rather be too hot or too cold with.<eos> Grandma always says the same thing.<eos> Yeah, she does, doesn't she?
American cheese is like a...<eos> A bed you can just fall into.<eos> So, whose good-bye party is this anyway?<eos> Frank pendergrass-- tree branch fell on him three days ago when he was jogging through central park.<eos> Bang.<eos> Dead.<eos> Well, that sucks.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You knew him how?<eos> Oh, I didn't.
reopens old wounds, you know what I mean?<eos> Yeah, well... this wound's not gonna close.<eos> Not until I find The Ghost and put him away.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's make that happen.<eos> So, looks like this guy also kept financial records on his laptop.<eos> It's a tangle of shell and holding companies.<eos> Very confusing stuff.<eos> Which means you probably found something, right?<eos> I did.
I'm coming back for you.<eos> I'm gonna get you out of this.<eos> Hey, Mac.<eos> Whatever happens here... it's not your fault.<eos> Okay?<eos> It was never your fault.<eos> I got this.<eos> We go to great lengths to keep the people we love safe.<eos> We spend days and nights worrying about them.<eos> Did we do enough?
Well, you're gonna have to be a bit more specific than that, mate.<eos> You know who I'm talking about.<eos> All right. Well, I'm gonna grab another drink.<eos> Who wants one?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yep. Is he someone we can even, verify having existed?<eos> Well, there goes our fun-spirited, team-building game.<eos> Yeah, his name was Elliot.<eos> What'd he do for a living?<eos> He didn't.
Please!<eos> I have a daughter. Lucy.<eos> She's 9 years old.<eos> They just want to know about the drives.<eos> Please don't let me die in here.<eos> Don't let me miss the rest of my daughter's life.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> But you believe me?<eos> You do.
Of you ever need somewhere to crash, there's always my place.<eos> Oh, no. I don't want to be an inconvenience.<eos> You've got all your lady friends, and...<eos> Actually, I'm single now.<eos> What?<eos> ! When did that happen?<eos> It's okay. It's by choice.<eos> Well, their choice, and it's not okay.<eos> Sorry. I didn't know.<eos> Nobody does.
Jeez, how do I explain this?<eos> Report.<eos> Garcia Flynn stole the tape from the White House.<eos> We didn't have a chance to stop him. Nixon was on it.<eos> He sounded terrified about Rittenhouse, mentioned something about a document.<eos> Destroy the doc. How?<eos> I'm not...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't have it.<eos> When you do.
I am sure that there are times when you've hated me...<eos> But you never poisoned their minds...<eos> Or stopped them from loving me.<eos> And for all of that...<eos> With all my heart,<eos> I am grateful to you.<eos> Why are you saying this now?<eos> Because it needed to be said.<eos> You told them.<eos> No, I didn't.
You know, your big finish...<eos> Get down! Finish...<eos> Your directions have taken us nowhere near our destination.<eos> We are lost.<eos> Zounds, odds bodkins, and so on and so forth!<eos> You two lost?<eos> Perhaps one of you can direct me back to the place mortals call, "North Hollywood"?<eos> So be good commoners and start talking, or else my buddy Thor here will rip you guys to shreds.<eos> Hey, brother, you just call us "commoners"?<eos> Yeah, we did...
Then I'll write it down.<eos> When he gets out of the pool, you need to put lotion on him or he gets ashy.<eos> Lotion.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you think that my son could play with yours sometime after school?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I think we can do that.<eos> And does he need sunscreen or not?<eos> He does, right?
So, Kate, do you know anything about my store or my background?<eos> Hmm... a little.<eos> I know that you've had this store since 2013 and before that you sold your own designs on etsy, until you partnered with that woman that you met at uc Santa Cruz-- go, banana slugs-- at her wedding in Thailand.<eos> Oh, so beautiful.<eos> Like, that is my dream trip.<eos> And then you imported those scarves then it just, like, took off from there.<eos> Oh, and you're divorced, you have no kids and you look amazing in wide-brimmed hats.<eos> I assume.<eos> You just have the head for it.<eos> I don't.
I...<eos> Because I'm in no position to judge you whatsoever.<eos> But you need to know, if I was in a position to judge you, you'd be getting a very high score.<eos> That story you told about helping to bus little black kids in Pittsburgh.<eos> That was '86, '87?<eos> Thereabout.<eos> So you were clean then?<eos> Just... functional?<eos> Because you know what this little black kid was doing?<eos> I don't...
Well, I haven't heard her make any requests.<eos> Have you?<eos> No, June can get the next match. Damn it!<eos> Damn it.<eos> Damn it. Grey, she's been on the list three years.<eos> Which means she's very strong and she can wait.<eos> Our patient will die in hours.<eos> She needs this.<eos> I know she does.<eos> And so does Granny June.
He just wanted one joke, and I went blank.<eos> I could've thought of something, anything.<eos> He just wanted to laugh.<eos> Well, the good news is, that was a terrible joke.<eos> I know.<eos> If the clot hadn't killed him, that joke would have, so it's a really good thing he didn't hear it.<eos> That's not funny. How can you...<eos> Edwards.<eos> No, you have to find the good.<eos> Andy did.
She's not listening.<eos> They're saying... that without the treatments, the cancer will kill you before the baby's even born.<eos> In a month, two months, you'll both be dead.<eos> I went to court to fight a traffic ticket so I could save $360 so we could buy an organic crib mattress.<eos> This is how my day started.<eos> And now I'm...<eos> All day long, I have been thinking that there is... there's a reason that I was in that line.<eos> There's a reason that I met you.<eos> And I don't believe in God or fate or anything.<eos> She doesn't at all.
- We need to get the upper hand.<eos> - How?<eos> Figure out why they're keeping us.<eos> As León said, we're here for a reason, but what?<eos> How are we all connected?<eos> They could be listening to us right now.<eos> We know they pose among us.<eos> So, maybe as we speak, we'll expose them.<eos> - Why should we trust you?<eos> - Because Alex and Ryan do.
She's right.<eos> She's an ass, but she's right.<eos> Dr. Webber?<eos> She's gonna be okay, right?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I think you'll have your secret weapon locked and loaded before the regionals.<eos> Dr. Webber, do you think I would push her to get surgery for some silly tournament?<eos> She's tried to drop out of the team six times, and that team is the only thing that keeps the lot of us from sitting around, watching TV in the common room, and moldering away like all the other old, wet sponges.<eos> She needs to stay in the game.<eos> We all do.
Mm.<eos> Fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Actually, no.<eos> Um, what did you mean before when, uh...<eos> When you said...<eos> "Promise me we'll never have kids"?<eos> Oh.<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> Yeah, but... you did.
How'd it go?<eos> It's bad.<eos> Nothing to be done, really.<eos> Some experimental treatments that'll give him a few more months.<eos> He's upstairs resting.<eos> Peacefully with his arms crossed over his chest, no doubt.<eos> I have no idea how I came from that man.<eos> I'm so sorry, babe.<eos> Yeah, I don't know what I expected.<eos> Yes, I do.
Um... yeah.<eos> That was... that was-- God bless her, that was my mom.<eos> Ah, wonderful woman.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had a good talk with her at the hospital.<eos> Well, she thinks that Kensi's gonna wake up and everything's gonna be fine, so...<eos> But you don't?<eos> No, I-I do.<eos> You know, but I'm also a realist, and I understand there's a possibility that she doesn't wake up.<eos> Or what if she does...
- Ask her.<eos> Or stop talking about it.<eos> Ever the romantic.<eos> Got a dead body on a destroyer.<eos> Quinn and I are in a helo out of Andrews.<eos> - You know, I spent a year as an agent afloat early in my career.<eos> It was amazing, but would any one of you rather go? 24 hours of seasickness?<eos> No, thanks. I'll pass.<eos> You know, they make medication for that.<eos> Do they ever.
- Yeah, well, I hope you're flexible, because you can kiss your ass good-bye when I get done with you.<eos> You already caused me problems, Stewart, so just get there.<eos> My brother says he doesn't know who signed on the ship as him.<eos> But he was headed up to meet me and my mom in Norfolk, so getting to NCIS headquarters won't be a problem.<eos> He's gonna keep his phone on?<eos> Yes.<eos> And if he doesn't answer all of their questions, you have my permission to shoot him.<eos> Mm. It'll be a mercy killing.<eos> Not like this job wasn't hard enough before, you know?<eos> I do, actually.
Yo, man, you didn't tell me you guys had all this stuff.<eos> Yo, this Tiger cruise is lit, son!<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Freeze!<eos> NCIS!<eos> Put your hands up.<eos> No!<eos> - So, why don't you tell us why you boarded the ship as Stewart Baxter and filmed classified areas.<eos> I didn't. I mean, I did.<eos> I did.
Walter, wake the hell up!<eos> Wait, what's going on?<eos> He's unconscious! Let him hear your voice.<eos> Walter!<eos> Remember, you promised to come back to the garage with me!<eos> Walter!<eos> It's no use.<eos> He's out.<eos> All right, so if he's out cold, how we gonna get the oxygen to him?<eos> We don't.
Well, welcome to the lab.<eos> Cool.<eos> Hopefully, these solar lights still work.<eos> Yeah, you'll be safe here.<eos> You sure?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> No one can see us from the road, and nobody in the whole world knows about this place, except for me and my best friend.<eos> We built it together.<eos> After my mom died.<eos> Mine did, too.
Yes, it is.<eos> I understand.<eos> Dinner at Isobel's. Clinch, party of two.<eos> I'm in.<eos> How's Agnes?<eos> She's fine.<eos> Screaming.<eos> I know we're supposed to let her cry herself to sleep, but talk about cruel and unusual.<eos> She missed you tonight.<eos> We both did.
You'll have to commit to a vitamin and mineral regimen the rest of your life or risk things like anemia, osteoporosis-- diseases you would never think of.<eos> And I thought the surgery itself was the only thing I had to be concerned about.<eos> It sounds scary, I know.<eos> But this surgery is actually a very positive choice for most people.<eos> It's just part of my job to make sure everyone knows all the dangers.<eos> Well, you're very good at it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And, because I know we're all anxious to get out of here and start our holiday,<eos> I hope you have something very fun planned.<eos> We do.
Not much of an appetite.<eos> So it spread?<eos> Yeah, it's everywhere by now.<eos> - Prognosis?<eos> - Poor.<eos> And you didn't think I'd want to know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I came here tonight to tell you I'm sorry;<eos> Did you?<eos> I didn't.
There's a difference.<eos> What happened to you in Georgetown?<eos> Since most of our viewers don't believe in demon possession, can you help me... help us... understand what you went through?<eos> I-I don't really remember it.<eos> You do.<eos> She does.<eos> I remember that I couldn't control my body sometimes.<eos> There was just this voice.<eos> It kept asking me to come closer.<eos> And when I did...
Well, I don't know.<eos> Would you like to call me Nana?<eos> Or maybe together we could come up with something cute.<eos> I'll think about that.<eos> You know who you look like?<eos> Me.<eos> Do people ever say that to you?<eos> That you look like a young Chris MacNeil?<eos> No, not really.<eos> Well, you do.
Rumors about possession tend to confuse the issue.<eos> I don't know where Marcus is.<eos> Maybe you can shed a little light on something else.<eos> We've been investigating this case as a kidnapping. But...<eos> I understand that your daughter broke a man's jaw on the L and then was held in the psych ward at Adams Memorial.<eos> It's not possible that... she could have done this, is it?<eos> I mean, I hardly think that's possible.<eos> Mrs. Rance, please, we're not trying to upset you here.<eos> Did they have families?<eos> Mr. Harris did.
Um, I hope you don't mind, I wanted to ask you a few more questions about Chris.<eos> Did you know him well?<eos> Actually, yeah.<eos> I'm a night owl, so I work late.<eos> He and I would have long talks about life. Life.<eos> So marriage, as well?<eos> Sure.<eos> Kelly was a frequent topic.<eos> Not to speak out of school. No.<eos> Please, do.
Is she gonna be okay?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, tell us what happened to our son.<eos> It was dark.<eos> And I fought as hard as I could, but she took him.<eos> Who?<eos> Who took him?<eos> The Black Fairy.<eos> Storybrooke felt like a dream.<eos> Now this does.
I got to get another meeting as soon as possible.<eos> Where are we with Catalan?<eos> TIDE and Interpol came up with nothing.<eos> The only hits on any watch lists are old Spanish radicals.<eos> Did you run him as a specially designated national?<eos> Nothing.<eos> How the hell are we gonna get lucky?<eos> Well, not everything the CIA knows comes up on the TIDE database, so...<eos> - You got a source?<eos> - I do.
Okay.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> - Sir.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We found him, sir. - We found Gabriel Thompson.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> He's on foreign soil, Mr. President.<eos> I thought we froze his passport.<eos> - How did he get out?<eos> - He didn't.
The FBI just handed in their report, and it concludes that Jason Atwood did, indeed, kill Majid Nassar.<eos> That's incredible.<eos> I asked Ms. Jordan to stay on as a White House correspondent to keep us honest.<eos> She kept up her end of the bargain.<eos> We need to do the same.<eos> Tell her we'll give her an exclusive on the man that we have in custody, but she's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sir, I'm sorry about Atwood.<eos> I know you didn't want it to be true.<eos> None of us did.
We're 10 minutes out.<eos> You got eyes on Kirk?<eos> Aram's trying to locate the escape vehicle.<eos> - Where are you on Dr. Shaw?<eos> - Nowhere.<eos> Reddington got to her.<eos> If we're right and Shaw knows how to cure Kirk, Reddington has just made sure that's not going to happen.<eos> Which means Liz is his only hope.<eos> Kirk's not gonna hurt her as long as he needs her stem cells to survive.<eos> But he doesn't.
Then I felt... this rush of exhilaration.<eos> I climbed up, looked into the yard... and she was just Dancing.<eos> ... unafraid.<eos> Daring.<eos> Being.<eos> I'd never seen anything like it.<eos> She had A joy for living.<eos> She was more alive than anyone I knew.<eos> When I heard she killed herself... I didn't believe it.<eos> I still don't.
Bouncing around three different women at the same time.<eos> I was a bad guy.<eos> But she saw through my insecurities.<eos> She gave me a chance to be the man that she knew that I could be.<eos> But you know what it's like.<eos> She was in love over this nonsense playboy life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I sure do.<eos> For certain.<eos> No, they don't.
Hey.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> You know, I don't know.<eos> Sara and I usually talk every day, but I haven't heard from her in almost a week.<eos> I keep leaving messages for Jorge and Maria but... I can't help thinking that they're distancing us on purpose.<eos> Well, you know, um, she's at a new school, making new friends.<eos> That's probably all it is.<eos> Why don't you try that again and maybe, this time look me in the eye?<eos> Cuz, you don't really want to know what I think.<eos> Actually, I do.
Mr. Williams, hi. What's up, buddy?<eos> I didn't know you were gonna be here.<eos> Yeah, I didn't know either.<eos> I got to... I got to ask you a favor.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Grace, I promised her that I would not spy on her tonight.<eos> Um, so I don't want to spy on her, but I want to ask you some questions, do a little research.<eos> Look, Mr. Williams, I-I already know where this is going, okay?<eos> You want me to tell you about her boyfriend.<eos> Yes, I do.
You have a very sexy... somethin'-somethin' going on, believe me.<eos> But there's a thing about you that bugged me.<eos> You walk around like you own the place.<eos> It's annoying. Mm.<eos> It's charming.<eos> Do you want to grab a drink some time?<eos> See?<eos> That. That is what I mean.<eos> No, I do not want to grab a drink with you. Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
Uh, I, uh, asked you all to come here because I have big news.<eos> Junior has decided to lease his apartment, and he's asked me to act as his landlord.<eos> A Mr. Roper, but with class. Wait.<eos> So this place is available?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> - Oh, it's very reasonable, but, uh, there is one catch.<eos> Uh... fish don't, uh, travel well across the pond.<eos> Oh, I will be the best fish mom. Uh, really, Abby?<eos> Because growing up, they called me "The Fish Whisperer""<eos> They did not. They did.
Now!<eos> Melissa DeLeon admitted to abducting Sierra.<eos> Your conviction's been vacated.<eos> You're a free man.<eos> People will still think I was involved... no matter what I do.<eos> I'll do whatever I can to make it right.<eos> I've been in here 10 years.<eos> Do you have any idea how long that is... when you're locked in a cage, staring at a cement wall?<eos> - I know you've been through hell.<eos> - No, you don't.
But, in reality, much of this success was a facade.<eos> The banks that had lent Trump millions had discovered that he could no longer pay the interest on the loans.<eos> Trump's empire was facing bankruptcy.<eos> His wife Ivana hated him because he was having an affair with Miss Hawaiian Tropic 1985.<eos> And then, a famous Japanese gambler called Akio Kashiwagi came to one of Trump's casinos and started to win millions of dollars in an extraordinary run of luck. Trump, who was desperate for money, panicked as day-after-day he watched millions being siphoned out of his casino.<eos> So, he turned for help to Jess Marcum.<eos> Marcum came to Trump's casino in Atlantic City.<eos> He analysed all the data about the way the Kashiwagi had been playing. He then told Trump to suggest a particular high-stakes game that he knew the Japanese gambler could not resist.<eos> His model, Marcum said, predicted that Kashiwagi had to lose.<eos> And after five agonising days, he did.
- _ - So,<eos> - _ - we took his dad's video camera and hooked it up to a homemade hot air balloon, sent it into the sky.<eos> Did it work?<eos> I imagine it did.<eos> We never saw the camera again, but I'm sure the footage looked great.<eos> Second time's the charm and all, right?<eos> Do we have picture?<eos> We sure do.<eos> How you supposed to steer it?<eos> You don't.
It's been hemorrhaging money for years now.<eos> The congregation has shrunk.<eos> Father, we've been growing recently. I...<eos> I can't abandon my parish.<eos> Your parishioners will be absorbed into nearby congregations.<eos> It happens all the time.<eos> Tomas, St. Anthony's will be shuttered, whether you accept this promotion or not.<eos> And, believe me, it is a promotion.<eos> You don't want me here.<eos> Of course we do.
No time to spare.<eos> I want people to be like, "How the fuck did you get in?"<eos> -"Just made it!"<eos> I know, I didn't think I was gonna make it, but I gave up that kidney and... here I am."<eos> "Where the bitches at?" No...<eos> I definitely don't wanna go to hell.<eos> I don't wanna got to hell.<eos> I don't wanna go to hell, Paul.<eos> I don't even know how hell works.<eos> I don't.
It's terrible.<eos> What if Anthony and Flynn ruin this?<eos> Today of all days?<eos> Let's find them first.<eos> I'll check Flight Ops.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Hey, need some help?<eos> No. Just, um... trying to get my card to work. You got to have the right kind of clearance to get in.<eos> Yes, I'm supposed to have all access, so...<eos> Just like you do.
I'm not a liar.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You lied about Jessica, you lied about hearing God's voice... that was a personal favorite.<eos> "Look at this family.<eos> See how they are suffering."<eos> I was trying to help.<eos> You were trying to be special.<eos> You were trying to pass the buck on every lousy decision you've ever made.<eos> God didn't want you, Tomas.<eos> He never did.
I'm gonna text you.<eos> Hey. You just made his Christmas.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look.<eos> I guess this goes without saying, but...<eos> You're glad I'm not another psycho hacker hell-bent on ending the world?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That. - Mm.<eos> But, Riley, I will admit, I had my doubts.<eos> He never did, though.
It's called a learning curve.<eos> - I got another word for it...<eos> - He's out of control.<eos> - Someone'll get hurt.<eos> - He's not a team player.<eos> He's gonna do it again.<eos> I just do not like him.<eos> Enough. I don't want to hear anymore.<eos> Unless you have a better idea.<eos> We do.
Who altered them?<eos> I did.<eos> Well, congratulations, you just got downgraded to a flea on a gutter rat.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I was ordered to do it.<eos> By who?<eos> The defense firm I worked for.<eos> We were told to help prolong the confinement of detainees who refused to produce Intel vital to the War on Terror.<eos> And how do you sleep at night?<eos> I didn't.
There was a reason we were sitting on him.<eos> We were building this case for months!<eos> That's right, you were.<eos> A case you would never have had if it wasn't for Susie Freeling.<eos> That chemical company she was looking into?<eos> They weren't even on the FBI's radar, were they?<eos> You told me yourself, she came to you, told you what they were up to.<eos> If it wasn't for her, you would never have had it.<eos> Did he tell you anything?<eos> Yes, he did.
I'll give the Barbarians something.<eos> They don't give in easily.<eos> Can we defeat them?<eos> We'll find out on the battlefield. Or wherever these cowards decide to crawl out from under their rocks.<eos> Is it true they have us surrounded?<eos> They do not have us surrounded. They do have us unsettled, only because I wasn't here to lead a... a direct counter attack here.<eos> If we hadn't gone back to Rome, we wouldn't be in this predicament.<eos> But we had to go back to Rome.<eos> We had to go back.<eos> Yes, yes we did.
Jamie!<eos> Stay right there!<eos> Hands up!<eos> Jamie, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> What'd you do that for?<eos> I dropped the knife!<eos> Doesn't matter. You grabbed for my gun.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> No, I didn't!
But not you.<eos> You've stayed right up where you always are, and believe it or not, I have so much more respect for you for doing that than if you'd flip and act different.<eos> I hope to God that you're never where I am right now.<eos> Me, too.<eos> But right now, I'm a voice for your son, and if you want to help me find who did this to him, you got to work with us, not against us.<eos> The 18 in selected sherry oak casks.<eos> Are we celebrating, or should I be worried that you've gone on the pad?<eos> That's one thing I haven't been accused of.<eos> I thought that shooting team gave you a clean slate.<eos> They did.
So you gave her the job.<eos> Guessing Petty Officer Gordon didn't agree with that.<eos> He never gave Cobb a moment's peace.<eos> Harassed her during rehearsals and after hours.<eos> Cobb complained to me, I decided to have him transferred.<eos> And that's when he attacked you?<eos> Ending his Navy career.<eos> Giving him even more of a reason to have it out for Heather Cobb.<eos> Petty Officer Gordon doesn't drive a white Jeep, does he?<eos> As a matter of fact, he does.

What do you think you're doing?<eos> Separating my delicates.<eos> This is the level you're stooping to.<eos> No.<eos> This is the level I am stooping to.<eos> I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate.<eos> Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy.<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> I'm here to put the crib together.<eos> Ooh, sorry, I already did it.
All of us wholeheartedly praise her.<eos> this candle is for my mother.<eos> for whom is yours?<eos> what you feel is normal.<eos> the Lord says you shouldn't suppress it.<eos> please forgive me.<eos> how are you and Fabian?<eos> why do you ask?<eos> I think he likes you.<eos> he doesn't.
Well, like I told you, there were no errors made during the trial.<eos> - You're on a fishing expedition.<eos> - Ease up, Bill. I win more cases than any other A.U.S.A. in New York.<eos> It's a noble thing you're trying to do, but you're not gonna save this guy.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> We need a copy of the execution briefing sheet.<eos> Got to love New Yorkers.<eos> Knocking's a formality.<eos> You said for me to make myself at home.<eos> - No, I didn't.
We're not investigating the fraud case.<eos> Well, maybe we should be.<eos> Nina told me that there's an internal memo that proves that the person who actually committed fraud is Earl's boss, Sean Rasmullen.<eos> No memo like that was introduced at trial.<eos> Probably because it didn't exist.<eos> There's no proof that memo wasn't just made up.<eos> As a matter of fact, there is.<eos> Nina kept a copy.<eos> Why didn't she turn it over as evidence?<eos> She did.
We've been friends forever.<eos> Since we were kids... little frost giants just causing trouble.<eos> Olafsson and Finklestein.<eos> Finklestein and Olafsson.<eos> Uh, we were never friends!<eos> You were always jealous of me.<eos> The Viking warriors always paid more fealty to me because they liked me better, and that made you crazy.<eos> Well, you bribed them!<eos> You said they'd cross oceans if they prayed to you.<eos> - They did! - Oh!
Come on.<eos> Everything's ready.<eos> Please, please be seated.<eos> I'm sorry again for being late.<eos> I was at church, and (Chuckles) things went really long.<eos> So, basically, you're blaming God.<eos> I am so glad we're doing this.<eos> Uh, Mike, want to say the blessing?<eos> Uh, wait a minute.<eos> Why doesn't Rob do it?
I have water.<eos> Just let it drag on.<eos> While all this is going on, all the hostage families are gathered at a school right across the street from the prison.<eos> [woman on TV] The school's doors remain open for loved ones.<eos> Dozens of family members have been here since the standoff started, and they vow to stay till the end.<eos> I got a phone call from prison officials.<eos> They said that a riot had erupted at the prison and that Bob was unaccounted for.<eos> And that's when I threw the phone.<eos> I thought, "If I get this phone out of my hand, it'll all go away."<eos> But it didn't.
Walls were designed to withstand rocket attacks.<eos> Armed convoys stood ready to repel ground assaults.<eos> And high-risk inmates wore monitoring bracelets 24/7.<eos> Authorities assumed that Altiplano prison was escape-proof, but El Chapo and his Sinaloa crew had other plans.<eos> Since 1989, the Sinaloa cartel had been burrowing beneath the Mexico-US border, carving out over 100 narco tunnels.<eos> By 2015, they'd become the drug underworld's most sophisticated tunnel rats.<eos> But Altiplano poses a whole new set of challenges.<eos> How do you dig out of one of the best guarded prisons in Mexico?<eos> The answer?<eos> You don't.
This is, um, gonna sound really weird and really awkward and totally inappropriate and I apologize in advance but...<eos> You've seen my daughter.<eos> You're not the first.<eos> Please come in.<eos> My husband Jerry, he hated the visitors.<eos> The first was a young boy.<eos> Will was his name.<eos> His father was the detective assigned to my daughter's case.<eos> No one believed me.<eos> Not even my dad, but... she did.
Let me see your goddamn hands!<eos> Get your hands in the air!<eos> Why'd you do that?<eos> What, are you gonna shoot everybody?<eos> - What the hell is happening?<eos> - Who the hell knows?<eos> - Quick, let's go.<eos> - Don't use your cell phone.<eos> - Why?<eos> - They did.
- The world's been at peace.<eos> Good you are here, Lothar.<eos> It would do the Guardian a world of good to see a friendly face beyond this old one.<eos> He can't refuse you...<eos> nor King Wrynn.<eos> Not if he's summoned.<eos> Chop chop.<eos> Did you summon him, Moroes?<eos> No.<eos> He did not.
Nights.<eos> But the Renegades rehearse at night.<eos> Hello? How's that gonna work if all you guys are so busy at night?<eos> It's not.<eos> The Renegades are breaking up.<eos> What?<eos> - No!<eos> - Things are changing.<eos> None of us have enough time to be in a band anymore.<eos> I do!
You thought that I was rude.<eos> - You were rude.<eos> - I was not rude.<eos> You were staring at me.<eos> I was...<eos> I was mesmerized.<eos> I was mesmerized by your beauty.<eos> I even had to get off at the wrong Metro station just to ask you your name.<eos> I lied.<eos> She did.
The station is temporarily under MGB jurisdiction.<eos> I think it's not good.<eos> It's not good.<eos> We can't go this way.<eos> We have to find another way.<eos> I think I know someone who can help us.<eos> I don't like this.<eos> I don't like him.<eos> I don't trust him.<eos> But I do.
Yeah, they say there's some kinda protest downtown, snarling' up traffic pretty bad.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I saw Castillo.<eos> - Hmm. Yeah.<eos> - He was talking to the IMF.<eos> I heard.<eos> He said a referendum.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - He promised. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he did.
We were young and stupid.<eos> Only one of us was stupid.<eos> Don't be so hard on yourself.<eos> I was irresistible back then.<eos> I'm gonna go check the readings upstairs.<eos> And she goes, just like she fled our marriage.<eos> Straight into the arms of academia.<eos> Safe, stable academia.<eos> - Still misses me though.<eos> - No, I don't.
Because I told them we would get Shakira for the National Jamboree.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> - I got to work.<eos> - Yeah. - Go get 'em.<eos> - Way to go!<eos> - Burning up the track.<eos> - Burn, baby, burn.<eos> Shakira?<eos> - How did he get Shakira?<eos> - Well, maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
I'm just a regular citizen that Congressman McCoy took the time to see... on the last day of his life.<eos> Because... he was a generous and caring man.<eos> I was there.<eos> I was there when he died... trying to Heimlich the cookie chunks from the Speaker's throat, but we just couldn't Heimlich enough and I blame myself.<eos> - Don't blame yourself.<eos> - I do. No, I do. I blame myself.<eos> I'm a woman with a nail in my head that I cannot afford to fix, which might hemorrhage and kill me at any time.<eos> But he was a man who I have learned happily crushed every piece of health legislation that he could get his hands on during his 31-year career.<eos> But... do you know what his last dying words were?<eos> I do.
Love.<eos> Oh, honey...<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Again!<eos> Again!<eos> - Again?<eos> Dear champion vending company, comma. This letter is in regards to No, wait.<eos> In regards to vending machine number 714 located in the intensive care unit of Saint Andre's hospital.<eos> I put five quarters in the machine, and proceeded to push b2, which should've given me the peanut MM's, period.<eos> Regrettably, it did not.
And can you push my lunch with Bob rice?<eos> I got a lot of catching up to do.<eos> Yeah...<eos> I handed you people a billion dollars' worth of committed capital and all you can give me is 150 million dollars' worth of companies to buy.<eos> Doesn't anyone like to shop?<eos> Should I call my mother?<eos> Phil.<eos> They called the house.<eos> Told me you were up here.<eos> They did?
I know.<eos> But it made me think, and I concluded that you might be right.<eos> God bless con ed.<eos> And there was light!<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've gotta go.<eos> Thank you for dinner.<eos> Really?<eos> "Moreno" means brown in Spanish, did you know that?<eos> Yes, I did, of course.
Yeah, we'll wait.<eos> Nah, I'll catch up.<eos> I'm pretty regular.<eos> We go.<eos> We've still got a couple more miles.<eos> How far back is she?<eos> She's gaining.<eos> - I don't think... - I don't...<eos> We need a new plan.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
William Ernest is in the living room watching telly's trolley.<eos> You're welcome to join him if you like.<eos> Why in the world would I ever watch a retard show like that?<eos> Listen here, miss Gilly Hopkins.<eos> One thing we better get straight right here tonight.<eos> I won't have you making fun of that boy.<eos> Just because somebody ain't quite as smart as you don't give you no right to look down on him.<eos> Who am I looking down on?<eos> You just said. You just said William Ernest is retarded.<eos> I did not.
Alive again, back from the dead.<eos> Enough of this make-out session.<eos> Focus on the launch.<eos> - Carson.<eos> Carson for you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Welcome back to the driver's seat.<eos> - At your service.<eos> We have a small window to gain control of our cyber intruder.<eos> Yes, we do.
When she gets off the plane in Oahu, she likes to see Allison there.<eos> She likes her salute.<eos> And so do we.<eos> Stay away from our girl!<eos> Current lat and lon is 34, 52... 85 east, 69, 17, 17 north.<eos> Poor Gilcrest.<eos> You took the vanity road, didn't you?<eos> You ruined yourself to impress a girl.<eos> And did you get the girl?<eos> No, I didn't.
T-1000.<eos> Liquid metal.<eos> Shape-changer.<eos> It just needs to touch something to mimic it.<eos> You know about terminators?<eos> And you know who I am?<eos> You were sent to protect me by John Connor, the leader of the Resistance.<eos> My son.<eos> I don't understand. You can't know any of this.<eos> But I do.
No.<eos> We go to 1997.<eos> Reese, put that back!<eos> I can't let you do this.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> But that is my one bullet to fire at the heart of Skynet.<eos> Give the chip back.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I thought you would be smarter, and that you would understand.<eos> I'm sorry, John.<eos> That thing won't hold him for long.<eos> Come on!<eos> Reese!<eos> Whatever they did to him, we need to reverse it.<eos> We need to get him back!<eos> He's not even human.<eos> We don't know what the hell he is.<eos> I do.
I suggest you think these things through before you make unfounded accusations against me.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Just".<eos> By the way, let me ask you a question.<eos> How did you know we was involved in jai alai?<eos> Happy Saint Patrick's Day.<eos> How are you?<eos> Everybody always commented on my work, right.<eos> - Sure, they did.<eos> - They did! They did!
I grew up with Billy, Southie.<eos> Sol know him, I know that he knows that it would be crazy for him to get mixed up in anything that Jimmy does.<eos> It's, you know, too brazen.<eos> I'll ask you again.<eos> How come no one has done Whitey Bulger?<eos> He seems to be involved in every crime in the city and yet the Bureau keeps saying he's clean.<eos> It's only when another agency has an informant that I hear maybe Whitey isn't so squeaky clean.<eos> Well, I hear that he's very careful, he doesn't use phones, that kinda stuff, and, uh...<eos> Who did you say these other informants were?<eos> I didn't.
- Where did he come from? !<eos> I thought we threw him off the rig!<eos> There's high ground just beyond that thing.<eos> - He means the tree.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Leave him to me. - Say, anyone notice that bright light?<eos> Encroaching gunfire?<eos> - Get out. - I can do this.<eos> I know this machine.<eos> He does.
"This day in April, 1948, my husband, Hank Williams<eos> "has a violent and ungovernable temper.<eos> "He drinks a great deal, and during the last month,<eos> "he's been drunk most of the time.<eos> "The past few months, he's been engaging in the wildest extravagances<eos> "and wasting the funds which come into his hands."<eos> I've been wasting the funds.<eos> Audrey ran up a hell of a tab at Lowry's Furniture.<eos> The owner says he wants it all by the end of this week.<eos> Does he now?
You want it back, you're gonna have to earn it.<eos> You're gonna have to come work for me.<eos> I'm not wearing a lab coat.<eos> Appreciate your work, miss.<eos> Oh, you gotta untuck that shirt, man.<eos> Is that Adolf?<eos> Long time.<eos> Still not German.<eos> And we don't need any more help.<eos> Yes, you do.
Reed, come on!<eos> The re-entry's not working!<eos> I don't know what to do!<eos> Get us out of here!<eos> Reed!<eos> Do something! We gotta go!<eos> Guys, can you hear me?<eos> Sue! Can you hear me? Johnny!<eos> Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?<eos> Yes, yes, I do!
He works for the government.<eos> But they didn't see us.<eos> It's 10, 15 years in jail.<eos> What if they woke up?<eos> Look, they didn't see...<eos> They had a kid!<eos> We're fine. We're totally fine.<eos> What if one of the neighbors saw my license plate?<eos> No one saw you. How do you know that?<eos> - They didn't.
We're fine.<eos> They do it all the time.<eos> It's right over that ridge.<eos> There it is.<eos> Look.<eos> We fucking did it.<eos> - I told you we could do it.<eos> - We made it.<eos> We did it.<eos> We fucking did it.
What, better than you?<eos> How many men would sacrifice their careers for their family like you have?<eos> Oh, I didn't sacrifice anything.<eos> I have everything I've ever wanted.<eos> - Debbie.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Will you continue to be my wife?<eos> I wondered when you'd give that back to me.<eos> I was wondering if you still wanted it.<eos> I do.
"Andreas, you got to stay off the 'roids."<eos> And he'd get mad, and hit me with a car antenna.<eos> Maybe that's the way kids are.<eos> No. Not really.<eos> So I adopt him, help him get his citizenship. The second the papers come through, guess what happens?<eos> I already know.<eos> They shack up together in Barstow.<eos> It turns out Andreas is her boyfriend, Brad.<eos> I did not see it coming.<eos> I actually did, about one, two words into your story.
Oh, damn!<eos> Rob!<eos> What happened?<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Elizabeth, get me a clean rag.<eos> I don't think the door's gonna hold.<eos> Let's just go up there and fucking kill 'em all!<eos> No, they're just paper tigers.<eos> Radiation sickness fucks up your strength<eos> - as much as it does your...
You flew here to tell me that?<eos> Why?<eos> Anyone can see that there is a real estate bubble.<eos> Actually, no one can see a bubble.<eos> That's what makes it a bubble.<eos> That's dumb, Lawrence.<eos> There's always markers.<eos> Mortgage fraud has quintupled since 2000 and the average take-home pay is flat, but home prices are soaring. That means the homes are debt, not assets.<eos> So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who gets his hair cut at Supercuts and doesn't wear shoes, knows more than Alan Greenspan and Hank Paulson.<eos> Well... Dr. Mike Burry, yes, he does.
I always get option-pay adjustables.<eos> I'm a private contractor.<eos> I need flexibility.<eos> And you tell the mortgage company what you do?<eos> I write "therapist".<eos> - You can touch me. - Always?<eos> Only in V.I.P.<eos> No, no, no, you say you always do adjustables.<eos> And you have more than one loan on a property?<eos> Everybody does.
And you tell the mortgage company what you do?<eos> I write "therapist".<eos> - You can touch me. - Always?<eos> Only in V.I.P.<eos> No, no, no, you say you always do adjustables.<eos> And you have more than one loan on a property?<eos> Everybody does.<eos> At least down here.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> Everybody does.
Not if there's no market left to sell them in.<eos> Forget it.<eos> We're not giving out any lifeboats.<eos> If Morgan goes under, we end up with nothing.<eos> Vinnie.<eos> Jesus, come on.<eos> I say when we sell.<eos> Look, I get that this is personal for you, but we have a fiduciary responsibility.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
Eventually, people get caught, things go south.<eos> It's fucking plummeting, man.<eos> When the hell did we forget all that?<eos> I thought we were better than this. I really did.<eos> And the fact that we're not doesn't make me feel all right and superior.<eos> It makes me feel... Sad.<eos> Every time I fucking hit "refresh" it's dropping, man.<eos> And as fun as it is to watch pompous, dumb Wall Streeters be wildly wrong, and you are wrong, sir,<eos> I just know, that at the end of the day average people are going to be the ones that are gonna have to pay for all this.<eos> Because they always, always do.
Oh, you know, just...<eos> You haven't really talked about it?<eos> Well, not really, no.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think He has a plan... and all three of us are part of it somehow.<eos> But it was us believers, don't you think?<eos> Just like this valley-- why it survived, why you and I did-- because we have faith.<eos> What if you don't have faith?<eos> You have to.<eos> Not everybody does.
They tried to put him down, but he was under my command so I took the blame.<eos> Two scars across my back as a reward.<eos> You know, you both have marks on your neck, but they're slightly different.<eos> The brand of the splicer.<eos> Marcellian Cahun was her name.<eos> She loved bees.<eos> My father would be freaking out right now.<eos> Do you know what this will do to people when they find out the truth?<eos> I don't think that most people would want to know the truth.<eos> I do.
When you're a kid, you don't think about consequences.<eos> You're invincible.<eos> Of course, they tell you all kinds of things to scare you.<eos> "Nothing comes easy." "There is no pleasure without pain."<eos> But, there's something about the Summer, the promise that anything can happen.<eos> And in my case... it did.
What makes you think I know where he is?<eos> I don't think you do, but I think you know someone who does.<eos> Uncle Rudi.<eos> I've also been told that your father was never... Actually a Nazi.<eos> He was forced to work for them.<eos> So I'm here to help him.<eos> - Why don't you help me.<eos> - With what?<eos> If I had 15 minutes, we'd drink tea, eat biscuits, I'd talk, you'd laugh, and we'd be on our way.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't.
He's an astronomer.<eos> Just retired form Stanford.<eos> His claim to fame is that he discovered an unusual comet.<eos> Unusual in what way?<eos> Well, It has a mathematical proven perigee.<eos> So, based on his calculations, it would pass by Earth in the winter 1981.<eos> - Did it?<eos> - No<eos> God!<eos> It did not!
I'm straight, by the way.<eos> I also happen to be Laurel Hester's partner on the force.<eos> We've worked together for many, many years now and I can tell you from firsthand experience that she is about as fine an officer as Ocean County could hope to have.<eos> Now, Laurel, Stacie, and I could solve this problem real quick, okay?<eos> I could go get a justice of the peace, take them to Laurel, and we could get married.<eos> And then when she dies, I'd get her pension, no questions asked.<eos> I could pass it along to Stacie, no problem.<eos> But we're not gonna do that because Laurel would never agree to it.<eos> I used to tease Laurel about her integrity, her ideals, because I'm one of those cynical hard ass cops who likes to say he doesn't believe in the system, or justice.<eos> But Laurel does.
Hello, there.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> Let the little ones have their share.<eos> We don't want you getting an upset stomach.<eos> Gus-Gus, you're a house mouse, not a garden mouse.<eos> Isn't he, Jacqueline?<eos> And you mustn't eat Mr. Goose's food.<eos> Isn't that right, Mummy?<eos> Do you still believe that they understand you?<eos> - Don't they, Mother?
There was no magic to help her this time.<eos> This is perhaps the greatest risk that any of us will take.<eos> To be seen as we truly are.<eos> Have courage, and be kind.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I am Cinderella.<eos> Your Majesty, I'm no princess.<eos> I have no carriage, no parents, and no dowry.<eos> I do not even know if that beautiful slipper will fit.<eos> But if it does,
Kind of looks like a penis, only smaller.<eos> Wes?<eos> Wow, boys' locker room.<eos> Nice.<eos> I need to talk to you about something.<eos> - So...<eos> - You have a question?<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Question?<eos> You do.
Guess what, so are you.<eos> So is everybody.<eos> There's always gonna be somebody prettier or more talented or richer than you, but it shouldn't affect how you see yourself.<eos> You label everybody to try to keep them down, but you end up missing out on all this great stuff around you.<eos> You have Wesley, and you treat him like he's stupid, but he isn't.<eos> And people don't like him because he's with you. They like him because he's, like, an amazing guy.<eos> Look, I like myself.<eos> I wouldn't wanna be anybody else.<eos> And I realize now that none of this matters to me.<eos> But it does to you.
You have notes?<eos> Whatever you wanna call them.<eos> But most of them revolve around cutting out Vincent Chase's mutant brother.<eos> - Drama.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He's an abomination and he's got to go.<eos> The challenge for me was I was the only human in that scene.<eos> Everyone else was living dead.<eos> So how did that affect how you played the role?<eos> It didn't.
What, you don't think my brand's doing fine already?<eos> I think you could always be doing better, no?<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Is this a business meeting?<eos> Uh... - Because I didn't know.<eos> - I didn't know either.<eos> Is this a date?<eos> I don't cook for people who are trying to pitch me.<eos> I thought a nice, normal guy wanted to hang out for once.<eos> I did.

And why do you always have to be so fucking honest?<eos> That's just who I am.<eos> - And I guess that's why we're not together. - No.<eos> We're not together because you fucked my stepmother.<eos> Don't ever forget that.<eos> And you told me that if I came clean and admitted it, you'd get over it.<eos> So don't forget that.<eos> I tried, Eric.<eos> I mean, I didn't move to New York because I really wanted to try.<eos> I did.
You cannot imagine what I've been dealing with.<eos> - These girls here are crazy.<eos> - I'm never touching another one again.<eos> Why, because of this or because no one'll let you?<eos> Guys, you know I love you all, but right now... I don't give a fuck about what you're talking about.<eos> We got a real problem with this Travis guy, and I need my manager-producer back now, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Did Ari tell you why he's not gonna release the money?<eos> - He didn't like the movie?<eos> - What didn't he like?
Uh, I just... I needed a little time, that's all.<eos> Come in.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, it's this thing Roger turned me on to.<eos> You heat it up to 209 degrees.<eos> No, I mean, what in the actual fuck are we gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, I never really had a plan for when life shits the bed like this.<eos> Do you have any sense of how many phone calls and hysterical emails I've gotten?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Go home.<eos> I can't.<eos> 9/11 was just the beginning.<eos> Protect your home, please.<eos> Protect your family.<eos> Bin laden, Saddam Hussein-- they have Anthrax now.<eos> Bump.<eos> What is it?<eos> You said you had a lead on marzin.<eos> We do. "We"?
Oh, it's just, um-- just the office, back home.<eos> Baseball emergency?<eos> Yeah, they, uh-- they put in this new surveillance system.<eos> It's giving everybody fits.<eos> I gotta get to the laptop in the hotel.<eos> You're really not gonna tell me where you're going?<eos> You know what?<eos> Truth is, it's probably better I didn't ask you to come with me.<eos> This way, I got to spend the next 13 years pretending that you might have actually said yes.<eos> And I did.
That's, um...<eos> Thank you.<eos> I guess he's probably the one who, um, you know, makes me the hardest.<eos> Jesus H!<eos> Well, you're going to be huge, kid.<eos> Richer than rich.<eos> Famous as shit.<eos> More women than you know what to do with.<eos> I'm telling you this, and I've got to ask, why are you sitting there staring at me looking like that information scares the livin' shit outta you?<eos> Because it does.
No way!<eos> You did this.<eos> Aw.<eos> You guys should know better, you know, you don't surprise a guy my age.<eos> You'll give me a heart attack.<eos> She looks like a young Jackie O.<eos> I look absurd with her.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> We have to make her sign a prenup, don't we?<eos> Yes, we do.
Thank you, man.<eos> -Thank you so much for...<eos> Thank you.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> So, now that the educational portion of the day is over, uh, let's get to the fun stuff.<eos> What fun stuff? Like...<eos> No, we're just gonna go back home.<eos> No, you said a day.<eos> Remember?<eos> No, I didn't.
Ten years ago I could not have pictured myself dragging my family the other side of the world to start over in some mid-management job.<eos> At least you're making a good living.<eos> And.....<eos> Doing good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know the bill of goods those Cardiff boys sell you.<eos> You got something against clean drinking water?<eos> Apparently.<eos> Maybe I do need a shot. No, you don't.<eos> No, you don't.
The nurse said, "You might want to turn that video camera off."<eos> And then your Dad looked at me and said,<eos> "You need to talk to her.<eos> You need to tell her to breathe because she knows your voice."<eos> "Loud."<eos> - "Say it to her."<eos> - So I started yelling,<eos> "Breathe, Lucy.<eos> "Breathe, little Lucy, please."<eos> And then I did?
What's up?<eos> Yo, is Leila all right?<eos> Where's Leila?<eos> Uh, she doesn't want to see you today.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> She doesn't want to see you today.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But I think we're gonna have to give her some space and respect her wishes.<eos> She said... she-she said that?<eos> Yes, she did.
Do you want to know what everybody called me?<eos> - What?<eos> - They called me a slut.<eos> Do you remember that? Hello?<eos> Do you remember that or not?<eos> Petra, I'm sorry.<eos> It was sixth grade, I didn't know what I was doing, and I'm sorry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I probably didn't have any titties to whisper to anyway.<eos> Nobody did.
- Call me Joan.<eos> Thank you, Joan.<eos> Take the kettle off the boil, dear.<eos> I'm borrowing the van, Mum.<eos> Did you hear his speech?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Poor old boy.<eos> Never wanted the job, did he?<eos> Got on with it, though.<eos> Yes, he did, didn't he?
By the way, what's a knocking shop?<eos> Just stack 'em over there.<eos> Come on.<eos> Papa...<eos> Mummy.<eos> Sorry we're late.<eos> This is my friend, Jack Hodges.<eos> He should have breakfast with us.<eos> I don't think that that would be appropriate.<eos> Well, I do.
Yes.<eos> It's in Farsi.<eos> But a medieval form of it.<eos> Can you read it?<eos> "With them, the seed of wisdom did I sow<eos> "and with my own hand labour'd it to grow."<eos> "And this was all the harvest that I reap'd "I came like water and like wind I go."<eos> Miss Bell, you know poetry?<eos> - You know Omar Khayyam.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Lieutenant, is there something I can help you with?<eos> Who allowed you to leave in the middle of the night, without a permit by the authorities?<eos> - There must be some misunderstanding...<eos> - We do have a permit.<eos> - You, who are you?<eos> - I'm Fattuh. The servant of Ms. Bell.<eos> Ms. Gertrude Bell, I know who you are.<eos> Do you have any weapons?<eos> No.<eos> We do not.
Fine.<eos> - We are...<eos> Sam<eos> - Sam.<eos> You okay?<eos> Do you really expect me to believe this joke?<eos> I can only tell you what happened.<eos> And your friend just flew across the room?<eos> I wouldn't believe it either before this.<eos> I do now.
- Inside.<eos> - Mag.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Maggie?<eos> Maggie?<eos> Get in the truck!<eos> -What's wrong?<eos> -Just do it right now.
How are you, Marty?<eos> Settling in?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> Good.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Um... I'd like to challenge the protective order in the Geoghan case.<eos> You want to sue the Catholic Church? Um...<eos> We're just filing a motion but, uh, yes.<eos> You think it's that important?<eos> Yes, I do.
Put it away. I don't want you recording this in any way, shape or form.<eos> Not on paper, not on tape, nothing.<eos> In fact, I probably shouldn't even be speaking to you, so...<eos> Look, Mr.Garabedian, I know there's things you cannot tell me.<eos> But I also know there's a story here, and I think it's an important story.<eos> I already talked to the Phoenix.<eos> Yeah and there's a reason I didn't see it.<eos> Nobody reads the Phoenix anymore.<eos> They're broke. They don't have any power.<eos> The Globe does.
But I also know there's a story here, and I think it's an important story.<eos> I already talked to the Phoenix.<eos> Yeah and there's a reason I didn't see it.<eos> Nobody reads the Phoenix anymore.<eos> They're broke. They don't have any power.<eos> The Globe does.<eos> If we cover this story, everybody will hear about it.<eos> The Church thinks in centuries, Mr.Rezendes.<eos> Do you think your paper has the resources to take that on?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I think there's a pattern.<eos> Sounds thin.<eos> What else you got?<eos> Sacha's got another guy from a victim's organization...<eos> Phil Saviano.<eos> From Snap? Oh, boy.<eos> We reported on him too.<eos> I thought you were watching the game, Steve.<eos> That guy's pretty banged up.<eos> We did a couple stories on him.
People need to know what actually happened.<eos> We should probably get these to go.<eos> Right.<eos> Geoghan shows up and my mom, you know, she's...<eos> She's thrilled.<eos> I mean, this was like God showing up, you know?<eos> Sure, right.<eos> So what happened then?<eos> You really want to hear this shit? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Patrick, I do.
Do you want a cup of tea, Sacha?<eos> I'm okay, Nana. Thanks.<eos> Hi, Joe.<eos> It's Sacha Pfeiffer.<eos> Hi, Sacha.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm good, thanks.<eos> Um, listen, Joe, I just wanted to follow up on one thing.<eos> You talked to Phil Saviano about all of this, right?<eos> Yeah, I did.
We would draw up a demand letter and send it to the chancery.<eos> You never filed anything in court?<eos> It's a private mediation.<eos> So, this is just you and the archdiocese's lawyers in a room?<eos> Correct.<eos> Anyone else?<eos> Occasionally the Church would bring in another defense attorney to help out.<eos> You have names?<eos> Nope.<eos> No, I don't.
It's okay, Kim.<eos> I can vouch for him.<eos> I'm Pete Conley.<eos> I'm on the board of Catholic charities.<eos> Welcome to Boston, Mr.Baron.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I appreciate you joining us.<eos> We're very proud of the work we do here in Boston.<eos> Oh, the Cardinal said you had a nice visit.<eos> Yes, we did.
Cloth cap?<eos> Whippet?<eos> Jan?<eos> Jan?<eos> When she hugged me, nothing came back.<eos> I didn't ask for this.<eos> Well, where else could we have gone?<eos> I'm only here because I'm sick.<eos> They must think I'm so fucking selfish.<eos> No, they don't.
No cops, no neighbors. It's perfect.<eos> - No. - Yes<eos> I said no.<eos> Shit!<eos> Shit!<eos> Shit!<eos> Rory, get up!<eos> Someone spitting.<eos> - How did you know I wasn't dead?<eos> - We didn't.
You don't give a fuck who hurts as long as it is not you.<eos> She's lying!<eos> Patrick!<eos> Patrick!<eos> Rory!<eos> More chains!<eos> Go!<eos> This way!<eos> Bitch deserved it.<eos> No, she didn't.
Seabiscuit.<eos> All right, all right, come on.<eos> And then he met you.<eos> And being around a good, grounded girl really did something to him.<eos> I mean, seriously, it changed him.<eos> You are so much better because of her.<eos> Last year, when Ivan got bedbugs and then came over to my place, and promptly gave my apartment bedbugs as well, they were generous enough to have me on their couch for about two weeks.<eos> And every morning Jon would make coffee, which seemed like a simple thing, and then we would all get up and have breakfast together.<eos> And it wasn't until the third or fourth day that I realized that Jon doesn't drink coffee.<eos> Elissa does.
Fuck. What the fuck?<eos> - That's coming out.<eos> - I don't feel good.<eos> Phil, bro, that wasn't even a blow job, man.<eos> Seriously, she just bit him.<eos> That was the exact medical procedure that you would follow if Jon had gotten a snake bite on his penis.<eos> - You okay, Phil?<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> - Daphne. - Phil showed you the wedding video?<eos> - Yes, he did.
Can't it just be fun?<eos> Mr. Walker, please tell me you can do better than "fun."<eos> Anything's possible.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> If I was walking down the street, and I saw some kid with a jet pack ﬂy over me, I'd believe anything's possible.<eos> I'd be inspired.<eos> Doesn't that make the world a better place?<eos> Well, I suppose it would.<eos> If it worked.<eos> Unfortunately, it does not.
Perhaps a common feature of his treatment here.<eos> A stranger releases him using a magnet and tickler as any fool can.<eos> They make their escape urgently, as they must for the circus is against them.<eos> They flee.<eos> A chase.<eos> A man dies.<eos> Manslaughter in self-defense at most, I would say.<eos> "Wanted for murder." Have it copied.<eos> I thought you said it wasn't...<eos> I did.
Yes!<eos> Pump all that blood around the larger body.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> He'd need it.<eos> Igor...<eos> Earlier, when my father was here...<eos> I was reading.<eos> I didn't hear a thing.<eos> Did he say anything interesting?<eos> No, he didn't.
So let's not get too far ahead of ourselves.<eos> No, let's don't do that, because we are not going to get anything out of this.<eos> Anything.<eos> We walked in miners and we will walk out miners.<eos> I didn't sign the book deal.<eos> Was I going to?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did I want to provide for my family and for my kid?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I didn't.
Mm-hmm. Hit me again, Mike.<eos> Or maybe not, I don't know.<eos> Right now it's just a theory.<eos> So, what's all this fuss about my dahlia?<eos> How do I know I can really trust you?<eos> The truth will set you free.<eos> The ID number matches the one that came through the wormhole.<eos> But that's probably just a coincidence.<eos> You people don't believe in coincidences.<eos> Sure we do.
Forty eight hours.<eos> We have to prevent that, don't we?<eos> We do. We should.<eos> I say we don't do anything.<eos> Don't open the other end of the wormhole.<eos> - Then it's like it never happened.<eos> - Have you considered--<eos> I'm here.<eos> It happened.<eos> Yes... yes, it did.
You're gonna get somebody killed, man!<eos> What's going on?<eos> So, the old train station in Paris, tomorrow night.<eos> You gonna jump in this time?<eos> I'm still hurting from the last one.<eos> - You're the guy I snaked, right?<eos> - Yup. And the one who plucked you off the ocean floor.<eos> I guess you never surfed anything that big before, right?<eos> - Has anybody?<eos> - He almost did.
People are attracted to people with talent.<eos> People without it find that threatening.<eos> Maybe you should see a therapist.<eos> Certainly couldn't hurt.<eos> I meant you literally threatened me.<eos> At Flint, right before the Mac launch.<eos> I was recompiling . I was trying to debug the voice demo.<eos> And you said if I couldn't find a solution, you'd call me out in front of the audience.<eos> Did it say "hello"?<eos> It did.
You know what "Lisa" stood for?<eos> What?<eos> The computer. The Lisa.<eos> Do you know what it stood for?<eos> I'm sorry I said that about the iMac. It's not what I really think.<eos> Behind my back, at the office, you know what it stood for?<eos> Local Integrated System Architecture.<eos> I was five!<eos> Why couldn't you just lie?<eos> I did.
My God, Bauer.<eos> There's no network.<eos> No connection to other facilities.<eos> Just us and some computer telling us that we're not alone.<eos> You're not alone, my love.<eos> It's designed to keep us from losing our minds.<eos> Bauer, are you there?<eos> Where else would I be?<eos> If the system is a lie, automated... how do we know if there's anyone else out there?<eos> We don't.
It'll be quick.<eos> It'll be painless.<eos> You have to do this for us.<eos> You know how much this hurts me?<eos> - We're supposed to be family!<eos> Family!<eos> - Yes, she needs me!<eos> - Look, look!<eos> - Goddamn it!<eos> She does.
Two words?<eos> "Or else."<eos> Wow, that's actually really fucking creepy.<eos> That's really creepy, right?<eos> Come on.<eos> You gonna pay for those?<eos> - Um, I did.<eos> Didn't I pay for these already?<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, I didn't.
Cross country running, wise guy.<eos> For what?<eos> To win, to compete.<eos> To impress girls.<eos> Nobody wins around here, White.<eos> Doesn't have to be that way.<eos> I watched you run.<eos> You can beat somebody.<eos> If I felt like it.<eos> Which I don't.
That goes away.<eos> - What are you wearing?<eos> - A dress.<eos> - What's it made of?<eos> - How should I know?<eos> Cotton, I guess.<eos> We said there's no way you're gonna do it.<eos> So what'd we do?<eos> Said, double your quote.<eos> And he did it.
Because, honestly, your clothes, they're disgusting.<eos> Says the guy in the crop top.<eos> What's up?<eos> Are you guys poor people?<eos> Are you guys poor?<eos> We packed light.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What did you pack, Tina?<eos> The basics, bikini, mouthwash, diaphragm.<eos> Hell, yeah, you did.
All we've got to do is stick with her and we're going to have the best seats in the house.<eos> Trust me, this last battle will blow your minds.<eos> - Okay, selfie time.<eos> - Duncan!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I think I almost just pissed my pants.<eos> - You did piss your pants.<eos> - What?<eos> No, I didn't.
Yeah, we took a vote and you get to share my sleeping bag.<eos> Thanks, Kurt.<eos> But I'm saving myself for someone who doesn't have a needle dick.<eos> Yeah right, it's like a hammer dick, if anything.<eos> It's a sledgehammer.<eos> Who are they?<eos> They're the new counselors.<eos> They're super nice.<eos> - We don't have new counselors.<eos> - Well, now we do.
And she just died.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Which is why we need to nominate a new final girl.<eos> And I'm willing to be it.<eos> - What?<eos> - Well, you're not a virgin.<eos> I am, too, a virgin!<eos> I technically am that...<eos> Whatever, what does it matter?<eos> Because it just does, Vicki.
Whoa?<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> I mean, it's just, when your son told me that your husband left you for a 19-year-old,<eos> I guess I thought you were gonna be, like one of those "hot when we first met in high school, "but then let herself go and got a potbelly and turkey neck<eos> "with a hairy chin."<eos> But clearly that's not the case.<eos> So more like, "Whoa, I should have brushed my teeth before I left the house this morning."<eos> Or studio apartment, if we're getting real here.<eos> Did you really not brush your teeth this morning?<eos> No, I did.
But this time the monster was real.<eos> And who was this monster?<eos> Pac-Man.<eos> Pac-Man?<eos> Boom.<eos> That's my jam.<eos> Let's get us some light cannons and blow this sucker back to whatever planet it came from.<eos> No!<eos> No, light cannons don't kill Pac-Man.<eos> Those little ghosts do. Boom!
What does she look like?<eos> - God.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> - I wanna know.<eos> She's a husband-stealing Pilates teacher.<eos> She's hot!<eos> And limber.<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> Yes!<eos> Actually, it does.
Come on, Dad!<eos> Lawrence, it's incredible.<eos> This is the third mini quake since we've been here.<eos> And the magnetic pulse rate has increased before each one of them.<eos> We got a pattern, my friend.<eos> That was a 2.2.<eos> Our model's predictive.<eos> We got it right, man!<eos> Finally!<eos> Yep, we sure did.
These things have a shelf life of over three years.<eos> They don't taste so good.<eos> Blake!<eos> I think we're going to have a problem with that big nozzle thing you were talking about.<eos> What?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We have to go to Plan B.<eos> I didn't think we had one.<eos> We do now.
Emma.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How'd you know we'd be safe?<eos> Just get up against something sturdy. Protect yourself.<eos> Triangle of life.<eos> Let's go.<eos> She's gonna be okay.<eos> But how do we get through that?<eos> We don't.
Please.<eos> That was his choice.<eos> It was the only way to save his kid's life.<eos> You gave them money?<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Insurance wouldn't step up, so we took care of things.<eos> It was the only way to get the little girl back on her feet again.<eos> You shouldn't have come here, Eddie.<eos> - This doesn't concern you.<eos> - Like hell it doesn't!
You are now, Jagoff.<eos> That right there is an east German model SMI-35 landmine.<eos> And it ain't no dud.<eos> If you ever loved me, stop.<eos> It's too late.<eos> I can't.<eos> I couldn't even if I wanted to, But I really, really don't.<eos> Daniel, Daniel, I fucked up, Okay, I know I fucked up,<eos> But for God's sake, man, don't do this!<eos> I already did.
Help, help!<eos> I'm gonna fucking kill you!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Alicia!<eos> Alicia!<eos> I'm so sorry, help!<eos> Oh, please, no!<eos> Oh, mom...<eos> Sorry, do you speak English?<eos> Yes, I do.
You have to be quiet.<eos> Gabriela, run!<eos> You should have killed me when you had the chance.<eos> Dad?<eos> Dad?<eos> Michael!<eos> Put that gun down.<eos> - I'm innocent!<eos> - I know.<eos> - I didn't do anything!
- Some.<eos> Which?<eos> You better speak, Nicholas.<eos> And I suggest you begin right now.<eos> I'll ask just two questions, Baby.<eos> If you're gonna answer them to your satisfaction, do what you will.<eos> First, why would I use a gun?<eos> The fuck kind of question is that?<eos> Why does anybody use a gun?<eos> Nicholas never does.
A prayer, OK.<eos> To make me feel better.<eos> Yeah.<eos> OK, uh... uh...<eos> Say the "Our Father" prayer.<eos> Our father...<eos> All right.<eos> Our father...<eos> I don't think I know that one.<eos> Then do the "Hail Mary" prayer.
A more aggressive story about the corruption within these aid agencies.<eos> But we felt it was too broad.<eos> Don't imply this has anything to do with anyone other than you, Mike.<eos> You said write about one boy.<eos> Suggest the issues through one boy's story.<eos> A personal portrait.<eos> And you were right.<eos> You were absolutely right.<eos> I assumed you had the research.<eos> I did, just not all in one place.
Anyway, I heard a couple of splashes.<eos> andaskedhimwhat was going on.<eos> He said,<eos> "Nothing."<eos> Yeah...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Could you point to the man?<eos> Let the record show the witness points to the defendant.<eos> Do you know the defendant?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Did a little drama nerd tell you not to touch it?<eos> I think he told me too.<eos> But then I didn't listen to him because I'm such a badass.<eos> Dan and Mark, can I see you guys up on stage?<eos> - Ryan.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - I know you don't take any of this seriously.<eos> - I don't.
Elliot and Jose helped us move in.<eos> Jose is Ana's friend, although I think Elliot's trying to poach me.<eos> He's a cool guy!<eos> Ana, where is your family from?<eos> My step father's in Montesano and my mom lives in Georgia<eos> - Georgia? Which part?<eos> - Savannah.<eos> How nice!<eos> Although I hear it gets really humid in Georgia this time of year.<eos> Oh my god it does.
- I want you.<eos> I'm trying, Christian.<eos> I know you are.<eos> Why can't we sleep in the same bed?<eos> Why won't you let me touch you?<eos> Why does it have to be like this?<eos> If you would just sign the contract you wouldn't have...<eos> Why do you care so much about the contract Christian?<eos> - Don't you like me the way I am?<eos> - Of course I do.
Uh, Jarrah...<eos> Jarrah told me a story.<eos> He told me about the, uh...<eos> the Rainbow Serpent.<eos> And how the women...<eos> the women were saved.<eos> Can you help me find my daughter?<eos> - I don't know anything.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Yes, you do.
I did.<eos> Give me interview.<eos> Come on and make it a good one?<eos> Esther Greely, birthday number 88.<eos> Bless her heart.<eos> Now, 600 words, and I insist you spend the minimum amount of time on it.<eos> That "Franklin Journal." It's always striving for excellence. Yeah.<eos> Did my, special order come in?<eos> The biographies?<eos> Yes, the did.
This was my best year.<eos> I am an asshole, Dan, because I have to make decisions to keep the company strong.<eos> You make a living from this company.<eos> You're replaceable, frankly.<eos> If you were to leave, Dynamic would continue.<eos> So, don't minimize my company's interests.<eos> Now, if you would please, as I said before, walk with me.<eos> We can discuss this in my office.<eos> Chuck, just because you caught me... which is, granted, a pretty big feat... in a trust fall at the company retreat... which you make us all go to... and that I don't like, by the way, that nobody here really likes.<eos> Nobody does.
Sit down.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah. I just got tear-gassed.<eos> A whole canister.<eos> I got caught in the crowd and in the horses.<eos> I just got shot, all over.<eos> I'm just explaining why I look so effed-up.<eos> "Effed up"?<eos> "Fucked."<eos> Oh, "fucked." Yes, you do.
.mov, .avi, or a .mpg file.<eos> We look forward to meeting you." Well, I guess that's meeting me.<eos> I swear I don't even know what language that was.<eos> What are you doing tonight, Ben?<eos> - A frozen lasagna? - Well...<eos> I could make a little salad, turn it into a dinner for two, like we did that time and never did again.<eos> You know that was over five months ago?<eos> No, no, we got to do that again, for sure, but okay if we take a rain check?<eos> - You're awful cute, you know that?<eos> - No, I didn't.
- Hi, honey.<eos> Over the hump.<eos> - So, how was your day?<eos> - Kind of okay.<eos> But you know what? Maddie said she didn't want to be my friend anymore.<eos> You know what? I don't think she meant it.<eos> She'd miss you too much.<eos> I'm starting to think that Maddie is bipolar.<eos> - We go through this every other day.<eos> - We do.
Like religious views, political views... - people who inspire you...<eos> - Jules Ostin.<eos> I'm not trying to brownnose you, but I've been in business a long time, and I've never run across anyone quite like you.<eos> You do inspire, Jules.<eos> I just knew, at the end of the day, that a woman with a glass of wine and a laptop had real shopping potential.<eos> And if you could actually promise her things would fit...<eos> - See?<eos> That's what I mean.<eos> - You have a favorite quote?<eos> - I do.
You will reach your destination in 300 yards.<eos> Little does GPS lady know she is an accomplice to a crime.<eos> The woman has a heart condition.<eos> Think of it as a good deed.<eos> I never thought you'd be a bad influence on me, Whittaker.<eos> Relax, fellas. This is gonna be a piece of cake.<eos> The key is under a flowerpot.<eos> We go in, we delete, we disappear.<eos> - She doesn't have an alarm, right? - Nope.<eos> She does not.
- No!<eos> Separately! Separate...<eos> - Ben.<eos> Ben, you there?<eos> Becky, don't screw around. Put Jules on. It's an emergency.<eos> - She's in a meeting.<eos> - Interrupt her.<eos> - Ben, what's up?<eos> - Jules, your mother has an alarm.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
- It's awesome, kid.<eos> So, how did it go?<eos> Well, you have a great kid, Jules.<eos> She's adorable.<eos> Thank you so much for doing that.<eos> So, you excited about our trip to San Francisco tomorrow?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I hope you don't have what Matt has.<eos> - I don't.
You remember the day I drove you to the warehouse? You were giving me the wrong directions and all that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, well, I stood in the back, and I watched you show the workers how to fold and box the clothes.<eos> I knew then that was why ATF was a success.<eos> No one else is ever gonna have that kind of commitment to your company, Jules.<eos> To me, it's pretty simple.<eos> About The Fit needs you, and if you don't mind me saying, you need it.<eos> Someone may come in with more experience than you, but they're never gonna know what you know.<eos> I never had anything like this in my life.<eos> Not many people do.
Not the love of God.<eos> It ain't the right one?<eos> I'm surprised that there's even a candle for it.<eos> Many people consider attrition a sin.<eos> How can repenance be wrong?<eos> If it's done for the wrong reasons.<eos> True repenance... Self knowledge.<eos> And it's made without hoping for anything in return.<eos> Come on, everybody that comes in here want something in return.<eos> Some do.
- It takes 100 years with them.<eos> - Maybe it's faster.<eos> - We need a list. - Look here.<eos> It says you fit it all.<eos> ... Horst Wohlers as new national coach.<eos> They had not cleared the contract... - I just need to...<eos> - Frits Ahlstrøm what has gone wrong?<eos> We must admit that it is a little unfortunate what happened.<eos> - Will Horst Wohlers coach?<eos> - No he does not.
You're in shock.<eos> Get away from me!<eos> Just get away!<eos> Did it cross your mind that you led them to me?<eos> I haven't got time for this.<eos> You need to tell me everything you know about L'Americain.<eos> Go to hell!<eos> I gave your father my word!<eos> And why should I trust you?<eos> Because my father did?
Why aren't you married?<eos> Because my husband met somebody else and left me.<eos> Oh... I'm sorry.<eos> And, well, would you get married again?<eos> - Has somebody asked you? - No.<eos> Not really.<eos> I won't ask what that means.<eos> Would I get married again?<eos> No, I wanna be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding house forever.<eos> Of course I do.
Where the hell have you been?<eos> No act.. you know what?<eos> Please, don't tell me that, because it's just another thing I would have to lie about in my weekly polygraph.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> Just keep walking.<eos> But, make sure you're not being follow.ed<eos> Oh. I didn't win those opera tickets, did I?<eos> No, I'm afraid not<eos> - So, where do we meet?<eos> - We don't.
This may be authentic. But there's only one person I trust to verify that information.<eos> You.<eos> No.<eos> My orders were to deliver you information regarding the Syndicate.<eos> Your orders were to infiltrate the Syndicate that we may learn more about them first hand.<eos> This isn't prove, it's a test, like everything else.<eos> The only way to pass, is to go back.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I betrayed Lane's trust too many times.<eos> And in every instance, you did so on you own volition.
- I want to know how!<eos> - Leave her alone!<eos> - How, how, how?<eos> - Leave her alone!<eos> - How?<eos> - It was her.<eos> Was she right?<eos> Was it.<eos> Was it.<eos> But I did not.
Four.<eos> Here... take this.<eos> $20, please?<eos> And how much money do you get in that month?<eos> First game is regular bingo or four corners... $50, $50.<eos> $100.<eos> How much did this cost?<eos> $20.<eos> That doesn't pay off, then.<eos> No, no, it doesn't.
So you hired outside contractors... so you could claim anonymity.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And then I guess you found out I was involved... when I helped Jeremy out with his loan thing.<eos> Oh, fucking Jeremy.<eos> And then you told them where to find me... and they found out about Andrea?<eos> I thought she was some weekend prostitute or something along those lines.<eos> I was shocked to find out you actually had a kid.<eos> Didn't really work out.<eos> No.<eos> No, it didn't.
Long time, no talk, huh?<eos> Um... Is this a bad time?<eos> No.<eos> I know it's been a while, but...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Uh, that's a good question. I don't know exactly.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm on Radio Hill across from Dodger Stadium.<eos> - Right. - Do you know where that is?<eos> I do.
It just sits there in the rubble.<eos> Three feet from our faces.<eos> And on the side of the shell Is painted one word.<eos> "Stark."<eos> We were trapped for two days.<eos> Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "This will set it off."<eos> We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.<eos> I know what they are.<eos> I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.<eos> Now I don't.
You can.<eos> You lack the materials.<eos> You're a brilliant woman, Helen.<eos> But we all have room to improve.<eos> I didn't realise you were waiting.<eos> I would've joined you, but, uh, it didn't seem like the right time.<eos> They used up all the hot water.<eos> I should've joined you.<eos> Missed our window.<eos> Did we?
By whom?<eos> Parties unknown.<eos> Do we have an ally?<eos> Ultron's got an enemy.<eos> That's not the same thing.<eos> Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.<eos> I might need to visit Oslo.<eos> Find our unknown.<eos> Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.<eos> I do.
We're imprinting a physical brain.<eos> There are no shortcuts.<eos> How could you?<eos> How could I what?<eos> You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world.<eos> It will be better.<eos> - When everyone is dead?<eos> - That is not...<eos> The human race will have every opportunity to improve.<eos> And if they don't?
That we're what's wrong with the world.<eos> This isn't just about beating him. It's about whether he's right.<eos> Natasha!<eos> Natasha!<eos> Bruce?<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The team is in the city. It's about to light up.<eos> I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere.<eos> Yeah. I did.
You didn't see that coming?<eos> Oh, for God's sake.<eos> - Zrinka!<eos> - Costel! Baby!<eos> No, no, I'm fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> Wanda.<eos> If you stay here, you'll die.<eos> I just did.
Official.<eos> Maybe they're overcompensating.<eos> It's kind of hard to call everybody up out of the blue after two years.<eos> Nobody's seen her?<eos> I ran into her and David at a supermarket, and a little bit after that, I heard they disappeared.<eos> And they met in the grief group?<eos> Mm-hmm, while we were still married.<eos> Yeah, I guess you could have put odds on our divorce.<eos> No, people don't think like that.<eos> Yes, they do.

I don't even understand a lot of the words in your book.<eos> I sat there with a dictionary.<eos> I try to learn. But I'm never going to be smart.<eos> And I'm ugly.<eos> I find it enormously charming that you read any book with a dictionary next to you.<eos> My last boyfriend was eight years ago.<eos> And he wasn't even my boyfriend.<eos> He was almost 60 and fat and he worked in Human Resources and he had a wife and his daughter was older than me.<eos> And the only reason he pursued me was because he thought he'd have a good shot.<eos> Which he did.
- 65, - 65.<eos> 66, 67,<eos> - That must be your daddy. - Hello, Mr. Aird.<eos> - Come on, better finish up. - Is she upstairs?<eos> Mommy, can you come skating, too?<eos> I wish I could, sweet pea. Why not?<eos> Pretty please?<eos> Hiya, sunshine.<eos> Daddy, I want Mommy to come.<eos> Oh, you do, do you?
It's lovely.<eos> And yours?<eos> Carol.<eos> - Carol.<eos> - And two dry martinis.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> So, I'm sure you thought it was a man who sent you back your gloves.<eos> I did.
It wasn't enough to rob your family and try to destroy it.<eos> No.<eos> You had to be eradicated from history.<eos> So the paintings reached the Belvedere.<eos> In 1941.<eos> Your uncle, Maria, died...<eos> At the end of the war, 1945.<eos> So, contrary to the request in Adele's will, the paintings ended up in the Belvedere well before his death.<eos> And if I'm not mistaken, he wrote his own will before he died.<eos> Yes, he did.
You know, you sound the same.<eos> You sound the same that you did 50 years ago.<eos> Well, I just...<eos> Well, I just want to say that I love you so much, mom.<eos> You know, I just love you so much.<eos> But I just want to say that I've... you know, it's like... It's not like I've ever forgotten you.<eos> I've never... I've always thought about you and you've always been in my, you know, my thoughts.<eos> Um, well, I know exactly what you went through.<eos> I have seven children, and I...<eos> Yes, I do.
- I'm ready.<eos> Okay, let's get this show on the road.<eos> All right, guys.<eos> Let's get Chloe.<eos> Oh, careful, this moves.<eos> It was all fear, basically.<eos> The fear was... was put in...<eos> And I still have fear.<eos> I still have fear to this day.<eos> But who doesn't?
- Uh, should what?<eos> - Be quiet.<eos> - I'm silent.<eos> - Enjoy yourself, Mrs. Rasal.<eos> Oh, I intend to!<eos> Can you please be more respectful?<eos> Yes!<eos> Slap it!<eos> - She likes it.<eos> - Oh, I do! I do!
You don't have to.<eos> We do.<eos> And we will.<eos> Grace said you were in some kind of trouble.<eos> - We're working it out.<eos> - You know you can always come home.<eos> The Man won't find you up with us.<eos> Neither will email.<eos> You know we love you.<eos> Yes, we do, baby!
Dude, I love this band.<eos> Look, there's David.<eos> Oh, my God, he's actually gonna go for it.<eos> A little more difficult than it looks, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> "Before the world ends, I have to dance all night."<eos> Pretty dumb.<eos> Hey, I wrote that.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, it's a pleasure To finally meet you.<eos> You are a clever girl.<eos> Hey.<eos> Stay where you are, pal!<eos> [Laughs] You think we don't know What we're dealing with here?<eos> You were fantastic hypnotizing half the world,<eos> Let alone my two guys at the bank,<eos> But now we have something that you're gonna have to do for us,<eos> Something that we knew about,<eos> But my stupid son didn't.
So I just want you to initial next to those two numbers as well.<eos> So just sign there.<eos> She put up with just about anything.<eos> Until when she had to bring the hammer down she brought the hammer down.<eos> She couldn't know what was to come.<eos> That she'd go on to make another 100 record-setting patents.<eos> Skinny 'velvet-hangers' make neater closets.<eos> That's a big deal to a lot of people.<eos> I mean, who thinks of things like that?<eos> Joy did.
-We'll see you tomorrow, OK?<eos> -Thank you, ma'am.<eos> And good luck.<eos> -Thank you for coming.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -Go get the next person, Tony.<eos> -OK.<eos> Neil.<eos> Sorry, we have legal stuff with Barry, now.<eos> Yes, we do.
All right, send me pictures and...<eos> I know what kind of pictures you want.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Don't be a bitch out there!<eos> You know me.<eos> I don't know where he is... I don't know where Johnny is.<eos> What'd you say?<eos> Hey, what did you just say?<eos> - What'd you say?<eos> - Nothing. I didn't...
Claire!<eos> Claire!<eos> Claire!<eos> Please, I need help!<eos> Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, thank...<eos> Get away from here.<eos> You... you have to help us.<eos> I already did.
Got some heavy shit going on up there today.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> One of the companies in that building got a surprise visit from Interpol.<eos> You know Interpol?<eos> You know, I think if I went home right now and, with the little space that I've got, but I put my mind to it, I could finish that tree house lickety-split, you know?<eos> Sometimes we make our problems bigger when we put off doing it the right way the first time round.<eos> Then they just get harder and harder to face.<eos> You think?<eos> I do.
I can do this by my... this is my thing right now with Amy, so...<eos> But I am your mother, and you are going to sit with me and allow me to be your support system.<eos> I'm not gonna sit with you.<eos> I'm gonna do this by myself because I'm a big girl and I need my privacy sometimes, so can you please go?<eos> Let's just give her a minute.<eos> This is about her.<eos> You don't have to be here right now...<eos> But she needs somebody to support her through this.<eos> - Uhh! I'm fine!<eos> - No, she doesn't.
Well, that's fine.<eos> It was nothing to do with me, do you hear me'?<eos> I didnae kill Wullie, I didnae kill Chris, and don't you go telling the fucking police any different, you hear me'?<eos> Okay, Barney, okay.<eos> I won't go to the police.<eos> Fucking dare you.<eos> You fucking bastard!<eos> What'?<eos> I'm sitting here begging you, and that's all you can say to me'?<eos> - I didn't!
Plainer than you might like to hear.<eos> In the past few days your brother has deemed it fine enough to mix business with pleasure by repeatedly engaging socially with my daughter.<eos> My only daughter.<eos> Sir, I'm aware that I have no position to offer, but the fact is...<eos> You are falling in love with her.<eos> Is that it?<eos> You play the part well.<eos> The other day, my daughter asked me why I didn't like you.<eos> Honestly, at the time, I had no good answer.<eos> But now, I do.
Can we keep it?<eos> As you wish.<eos> Now, Your Ladyship, may I have the honor?<eos> Goodness.<eos> How many rooms are there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Would you like to count them?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Does it look the part?<eos> It does.
Guy Chambers.<eos> Lavinia Beech.<eos> The name again, please?<eos> Guy Chambers.<eos> Mr. Chambers.<eos> Forgive me for the cursory nature of my greeting.<eos> I am Sunil Indrajit Kapoor, owner and proprietor of this great and sincerely profitable hotel.<eos> I'm pleased to meet you...<eos> Of course we have our most luxurious room available.<eos> - We do?
You think because you're with this white woman that you've climbed a treetop?<eos> You think her white hair is going to fluster me?<eos> Don't talk rubbish!<eos> Just because you've caught hold of some old white buffalo you think I'm going to give in...?<eos> Every single word... ...?<eos> 25,000 Rupees...<eos> Done.<eos> What did I say?<eos> That you understood every word he was saying and he should have more respect for his elders.<eos> Well, he does now.
And I think I'm open to it now because of our talk.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's good. I love the fact that you're listening.<eos> I love that.<eos> You know, you're the best boyfriend I never had.<eos> Ha, ha. Okay. Ha-ha-ha.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm not totally giving up.<eos> There is time.<eos> - And things change with time.<eos> - No, no, they don't.
I was right there.<eos> I can't believe you remember that.<eos> You a hero.<eos> Shut his perverted ass right down.<eos> I never forget it.<eos> So you and Greg are coworkers?<eos> Naw, we friends.<eos> He just hates calling people his friend.<eos> Dude's got issues.<eos> Yeah, he does.
I've been clean two years today.<eos> I hope it stays that way.<eos> I've fought hard for this.<eos> Each and every day, even now.<eos> You know, my mom... she always said that in life you can be whatever you want if you want it hard enough.<eos> What bullshit.<eos> It's bullshit and she knows it.<eos> She's always sat behind the till at the supermarket well, stood.<eos> I always wanted to be Madonna.<eos> Still do.
She's always sat behind the till at the supermarket well, stood.<eos> I always wanted to be Madonna.<eos> Still do.<eos> You don't always get to choose.<eos> What weather it will be, what men you fall for... getting hit by a car and ending up in a wheelchair.<eos> You don't choose those things.<eos> You can lie in bed all day, crying.<eos> Or you try to make a go of it, one day at a time.<eos> That's what I did, 'cos that's a choice I do have.<eos> You all do.
This isn't Social Services.<eos> Nico, I'd like to help, but like I said, times are hard.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Penalty!<eos> It's a sure thing, it's gonna be OK.<eos> Don't mess up!<eos> Robert, if he scores, I'll double up your 600.<eos> - I'll go to the bank right now.<eos> - Kid, it's not worth it.<eos> And if he doesn't?
Your cock sucked?<eos> It might be nice.<eos> This is what I'm saying!<eos> There comes a time when, you know, every woman knows you gotta suck a cock!<eos> How would you know that?<eos> 'Cause I've done it before?<eos> You've sucked a cock. Yeah.<eos> When was this, and how come I didn't know about it?<eos> My man days. You know about my man days.<eos> No, I don't.
Okay.<eos> Careful, dad.<eos> Oh my god! Wow. The Johnson's left their home.<eos> That's weird.<eos> So, uh... are you gonna see your... Friends again?<eos> Yeah, we'll see who's there. Woah.<eos> So fast.<eos> Sorry I gotta ask you this...<eos> You got money, yeah?<eos> Yes sir, I do, sir.
You're on your own, Danny.<eos> I can't be implicated in any of this.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I work for Mattel.<eos> You piece of shit.<eos> Killing him at Fenway Park wasn't enough for you, huh?<eos> What do you wanna do now?<eos> You don't deserve him, John.<eos> you never did, you never did!
-I don't know.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> If I had a dime for every time I did something a cocktail waitress told me not to do, I'd be rich.<eos> Look.<eos> Oh, my God, the cocktail waitress was wrong.<eos> Sorry, my mistake.<eos> I should listen to you more often, Lou.<eos> All right.<eos> You just learned a valuable life lesson.<eos> I did.
He won't care.<eos> He's here to kill you, Katia.<eos> And I'm here to stop him.<eos> I know you don't have any reason to trust me but look at him. Look at how he moves.<eos> Look at the shadows on his coat.<eos> Look at his eyes, and tell me that I'm lying.<eos> Why would anyone want to kill me?<eos> For the same reason you're trying to look for someone you can't find.<eos> The man I'm looking for, Do you know where he is?<eos> No, but you do.
So, the Syndicate doesn't know we're here?<eos> There's a open contract out on us.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Here, try not to take this apart.<eos> - Robert, please! - How did they find us so quick?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> - No games.<eos> - What makes you think this is a game?<eos> The cameras in the Terminal didn't see me.<eos> But the one outside, near the exit, did.
Good.<eos> Next, your boss on the line with me in 15.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> I have $74 million of his money. You make it possible.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your note said that you know me, but I don't know you.<eos> But that's not really true, is it, Hathaway?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I know you.<eos> Ah, you do?
Yeah. Go for it.<eos> Read it and weep.<eos> Take it easy there.<eos> - Right, you can stop.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - You're in great shape, Beck.<eos> - I'm in great shape.<eos> - Yeah. - 6 days a week in the gym<eos> - ought to do it. - Your wife must have love that.<eos> Yeah, she does.
You okay?<eos> I'll see you then.<eos> 04:00 PM There she is. (04:00 PM)<eos> Almost there, mate.<eos> Dig deep, Doug.<eos> Dig deep.<eos> There you go.<eos> There you go.<eos> Huh, you made it.<eos> You did it.
Just one more thing.<eos> The two of you, you're out here alone, are you not?<eos> Yeah, just us.<eos> I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.<eos> Service will be up in 20.<eos> Finn's preparing the feeds now.<eos> You fucking kidding me?<eos> Nancy, you should have taken the hotel.<eos> So how do we know we can trust these guys?<eos> We don't.
I just...<eos> I just don't know how to make this work.<eos> I don't know either.<eos> But I know that I want to.<eos> Are we just crazy?<eos> Do you think it could work between us?<eos> We just come from such different worlds.<eos> But I've never felt this way about anybody before.<eos> Not everybody gets that.<eos> You did.
Speaking of my parents, they're gonna swing by here on their roadtrip for Andrew's birthday party.<eos> So... You're gonna need to work on the lawn.<eos> What's wrong with the lawn?<eos> Oh, Daddy wouldn't approve of those hedges.<eos> Well, it's not his lawn.<eos> Well... He did help pay for the house, Don, so I guess that makes it partially his lawn.<eos> Does he partially own the kids because he pitches in for their private school?<eos> He just wants what's best for them.<eos> And I don't?<eos> Of course you do.
Can I go play Xbox now?<eos> "May" we, not "can" we. And yes.<eos> Andrew?<eos> Thank you, Ally.<eos> Good job, buddy.<eos> Don...<eos> Honey, how was your day?<eos> Same old, same old.<eos> Did the new hire make a sale?<eos> Actually, she did.
Watch your head.<eos> Dom, you have a package out here!<eos> It's from Tokyo.<eos> Tokyo?<eos> What? Is Han trying to convert me over to a turbocharger?<eos> All right, you ready?<eos> There we go.<eos> - Yeah! - Hey, buddy. Cars don't fly.<eos> Hey, cars don't fly.<eos> This one did, huh?
I don't know, but you being in front of me feels right. Ooh! Ah.<eos> Okay!<eos> I float like a butterfly, sting like a...<eos> I used to have my own bistro in Laguna Beach.<eos> Only one house rule.<eos> Absolutely no substitutions.<eos> Aah! Oh, yeah.<eos> Nice on, cabron.<eos> Landed flush.<eos> Yeah, it did.
- What?<eos> - I have been hand plucked to be put on a waiting list, to put on a very well known TV singing competition.<eos> - Yep!<eos> I know what you're thinking...<eos> Oh! Bumper! You shut your face and kiss me, Bumper<eos> Bumper, please, just...<eos> That is not even how I talk.<eos> You talk exactly like this. - I do not.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't.
That's awesome for you.<eos> I never went to college.<eos> That doesn't have to be a permanent state.<eos> You aren't an amputee.<eos> I know that.<eos> You can still go to college.<eos> We'll get lifted and you'll tell us about this venture.<eos> Do any of you kids know how to make an apple bong?<eos> No one knows how to make an apple bong.<eos> I do.
Be it their comfort we are coming thither.<eos> I have words that would be howled in the desert air<eos> where hearing should not latch them.<eos> My ever gentle cousin.<eos> Stands Scotland where it did?<eos> Alas, poor country, it's almost afraid to know itself.<eos> It cannot be called our mother but our graves.<eos> What's our newest grief?<eos> Let not your ears despise my tongue which shall possess them with the heaviest sound that ever yet they heard.<eos> How does my wife?
Is he happier now?<eos> No.<eos> What does he want?<eos> None of your business.<eos> I know one thing.<eos> He wants you to remarry.<eos> Nothing strange about that.<eos> His son needs a father.<eos> His woman needs a man.<eos> She doesn't.
Irma is as well as can be expected.<eos> Mmm. She kept running into doors, if I remember, your wife.<eos> Cut lips, black eyes...<eos> Can I help you?<eos> That all miraculously went away when you become a hunchback.<eos> Tilly... I heard she was back.<eos> I had no idea she was so beautiful.<eos> Gertrude knows fruit preservatives.<eos> Female intimate apparel.<eos> She does her own hair too.
You don't want to?<eos> Yes, but...<eos> Then you must. I mustn't.<eos> Nobody would know.<eos> Please go now.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> 8:00.<eos> The hollow in the ferns.<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> I do.
619!<eos> Thanks.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Daniel Bryrock, have a flyer.<eos> No, thanks, Cenastone.<eos> I don't want your flyer.<eos> - Please, please.<eos> I insist. - I said, "No, I don't".<eos> - But I think you wanna say, yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't!

Randy.<eos> I'm leaving you.<eos> You gonna miss me?<eos> About as much as you gon' miss me.<eos> Randy, don't underestimate yourself.<eos> I've... actually grown quite attached to you.<eos> All this time together... this is how you say goodbye?<eos> Somehow...<eos> I know that you won't forget me.<eos> Most people don't.
I have what I'd like to call a sensitive soul.<eos> I can see and feel a lot more than some people.<eos> Makes for a wonderful palate.<eos> When I drink wine I can feel the grapes and soil and the weather.<eos> But sometimes... sometimes it goes deeper than that.<eos> I get connected to a person or a place.<eos> It comes out of nowhere.<eos> It wraps its fingers around your heart and won't let go.<eos> Did you see something at the house?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I did.
- Did you play with his chicken and eggs?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can't.<eos> Ha-ha-ha. Did you give him a pirate key?<eos> What is a pirate key?<eos> I don't even know what that is.<eos> That's horrifying.<eos> Well, it depends on who the pirate is.<eos> - It didn't work out on the date. - Mm.<eos> It never does.
Cut it out, Mrs. Capponi is excellent.<eos> - You're wrong.<eos> - Livia, you don't study, that's it.<eos> But I did lots of quizzes for my license.<eos> - License?<eos> - For the scooter.<eos> The scooter is far off.<eos> But you promised!<eos> - We didn't promise a thing.<eos> - Dad did.
And never get complacent because, you know, As you get calm and comfortable around them,<eos> That's when they'll turn around and kick you or bite you.<eos> Don't release when he's kicking out. We have 13 wild horses for this trip. And it's gonna take us four months to train them.<eos> Two professional trainers, Jerry Jones and Lenny leech, Are gonna take them for the first 30 days.<eos> After that, we're gonna train the horses For another three months and get them ready for the trip.<eos> The word many people use for wild horses is "mustangs," And that's not a particular breed or a species.<eos> That's just a folksy word for the wild horses we have<eos> Not even to take on the whole, "are they native,<eos> Or are they feral," but the question of, you know, Do these horses have a right to be here?<eos> Yeah, absolutely they do.
...and they let me use it.<eos> I don't know why you got to pick your identity. I had to go as a freaking cat lady.<eos> -Amber!<eos> -Yes?<eos> Who is this?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know the police were here.<eos> This is my colleague, detective.<eos> The one I fucking told you about.<eos> No, you didn't.
Well, he overcame cancer, and I've had cancer, so I can appreciate it.<eos> Cancer... it's a brutal experience.<eos> But you meet yourself along the way.<eos> I approached my disease the same way that I'd approach a race.<eos> There's an enemy to be defeated.<eos> I recall one time in the hospital, the third cycle of chemo, very weak, making my way down an endless hallway and a nurse comes up to me with a wheelchair.<eos> She said, "Mr Armstrong, would you care to sit down?"<eos> And I said, "Thanks, but no thanks."<eos> "I'm gonna walk."<eos> And I did.
Any man of honor who finds the lost throne and dons the crown will unlock all of the magic and ascends to the throne as king of the world!<eos> Of course, it's all made up.<eos> The man that attacked me is dangerous.<eos> If he gets his hands on the crown, he will use its powers for evil and personal gain.<eos> Well, with the right amount of power, every man is dangerous.<eos> Do you see that, Father?<eos> Those are words of a king.<eos> - I don't want to be king!<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I do not. - Yes, you do!
Why do you continually go into things that will be a disaster?<eos> I've been trying to get you to help me heal this family.<eos> And when you finally show up, you just bring more pain.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> The parking lot's filling up.<eos> We need to open now.<eos> Okay. Hey, you.<eos> I can't talk about this anymore right now.<eos> I wish I had time.<eos> But I don't.
In 1932 and 1933, Ukraine suffered a terrible famine, which led many people to resort to cannibalism.<eos> We'll be interviewing famine survivors, but we're here mainly because of Boris Glaskov, charged with cannibalism, who decided to speak about it openly.<eos> It'll be a cannibal's confession.<eos> Oh, you think that's too much?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I think it's good.<eos> I think we need to keep constantly shocking the viewer.<eos> I mean, if it's too much, we can edit it out later, right?<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> [laughs] How do you do?
Fine, I won't touch the glass, okay?<eos> No touch.<eos> Happy?<eos> So he's gonna charge us $800 for a cab?<eos> He's nuts.<eos> That's more expensive than London.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Yes, but it's hundred kilometers from Charkoc, which is the closest we can get.<eos> And as well, he wants half of his money in advance, so he wouldn't come here empty-handed.<eos> Well, of course he does.
- Yeah, what, now you need a green card to be fucking abducted?<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> I mean, he shouldn't even be here.<eos> What does that matter?<eos> Ask him if he was in the country legally.<eos> Ask him.<eos> Ah, see?<eos> Come on.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Sure it does!
Oh, come on, come on, come on!<eos> Don't do anything!<eos> They'll both die.<eos> We have to know what happens.<eos> What is wrong with you people?<eos> She's just a kid.<eos> Why Would you go after her?<eos> One of them has to die.<eos> We need to decide.<eos> - No, we don't.
Don't worry...<eos> I'm not voting for you.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> Yeah, We're...<eos> We're gonna get out of here, man.<eos> - Yeah, sure we are.<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> No, you come on, man.<eos> He knows the truth.<eos> We all do.
I'm not calling anybody idiots, all right?<eos> All I'm saying is this...<eos> if there is a God, is this something... does this seem like he Would allow this?<eos> Is this something he Would do?<eos> You fuckers are gonna kill me because You're afraid I'm right?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're fucking cowards, huh?<eos> Wait, please.<eos> I didn't even say anything wrong.<eos> He did.
Why didn't they tie?<eos> Yeah, it doesn't make sense.<eos> Why did they tie the first time and not the second?<eos> 'Cause somebody changed their vote.<eos> Who?<eos> Why don't you ask your wife?<eos> It was you?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, yes, but... why'd you switch?<eos> I didn't.
What?<eos> What is your husband's name?<eos> He already said his name.<eos> That's right.<eos> When?<eos> The first time he spoke, he said his name.<eos> Just drop it, man, okay?<eos> What's... His name?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Of course she doesn't.

- We say this at every panel we're asked to present.<eos> Your future hasn't been Written yet, right?<eos> - No one's has.<eos> - No one's has!<eos> Your future is whatever you make it.<eos> - So, make it a good one.<eos> - Make it a good one.<eos> -[screaming]<eos> -[Gale] People always say to us, "Well, you guys must have known you were gonna do sequels "because of the ending of the first movie."<eos> Well, no, we didn't.
I'm dead inside.<eos> So we should go where life began.<eos> - Outer space?<eos> - Africa, man.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Why would you wanna go there?<eos> You gotta take a lot of antibiotics to go there, Joe.<eos> What about Sweden?<eos> You always said swarthy guys fare well in Sweden.<eos> Yeah, we do.
All right?<eos> Everybody just owe me 50 bucks.<eos> I'll pick up everything we need.<eos> No,I 'mnot givingyou50 bucks.<eos> Where are you getting alcohol?<eos> Relax. I can get us a deal.<eos> I know a guy.<eos> You know a guy?<eos> Who are you, fucking Pablo Escobar?<eos> No run... Or do.
Ugh! You're disgusting.<eos> - Raymond, you're disgusting.<eos> It wasn't me, I swear.<eos> Sure.<eos> All right, so what?<eos> I farted.<eos> As if you never fart.<eos> Girls don't fart.<eos> - My auntie farts.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
- Raymond, you're disgusting.<eos> It wasn't me, I swear.<eos> Sure.<eos> All right, so what?<eos> I farted.<eos> As if you never fart.<eos> Girls don't fart.<eos> - My auntie farts.<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> - Yes, she does.
Where is this guy?<eos> - It's them. - Hey!<eos> What, are you back for more?<eos> Did you do this to him?<eos> No...<eos> I did it.<eos> You?<eos> So the little baby brought his nanny.<eos> I thought you told me that a big guy beat you up.<eos> I did.
Come in, sit down.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And thank you for seeing me on such a short notice.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> So how can I help?<eos> Well, I came here because, uh, I coach a bunch of the kids at the community center.<eos> But because of the budget cuts, we're having a difficult time supporting them.<eos> So I was wondering if you would have any interest in supporting us.<eos> I assume you have some experience in tournament competitions.<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
- What's up?<eos> Good, man.<eos> He in the doghouse, yo.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Later, man.<eos> - Hit me.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Yeah. Why are you getting into so many fights?<eos> I don't like to be teased.<eos> Nobody does, Rasheed.
Coach, look at my nails.<eos> That's great.<eos> Boys, how do like your hand massage?<eos> This is awesome.<eos> - Hey, Coach?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> What does the Bill of Rights mean?<eos> Oh, oh, I know!<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Mr. Newman...<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I have an animation here that might be of interest to your theater.<eos> A sort of bonus reel on local Kansas City issues.<eos> The pot holes, for instance.<eos> Aren't you too young to make Felix the Cat?<eos> That's not mine, sir.<eos> That's too bad, because he's the biggest star in Hollywood and that's what my theater shows.<eos> Well, I have something much better.<eos> Sure, you do.
I don't know what's happening.<eos> It's all falling apart.<eos> I feel the rigor mortis setting in.<eos> Walt, you have a lot of people that believe in you.<eos> Don't loose faith.<eos> I can't keep people working on faith.<eos> I don't blame them for leaving.<eos> They just don't have the vision that you have... they don't see what you see.<eos> I don't even see what I see anymore.<eos> I do.
Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.<eos> Volcan!<eos> Volcan!<eos> Volcan!<eos> Volcan! I was about to fall asleep before that.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Oh! Kenny Loggins?<eos> You're still playing?<eos> You guys had guns?<eos> Oh, hell, yeah, we do.
- Sir, your watch. - Keep the watch.<eos> Keep it.<eos> I want you to have it.<eos> Damn!<eos> He's a good guy.<eos> Franny, I was just thinking.<eos> And?<eos> - Why do I just wanna strangle him? - What?<eos> Don't get me wrong, I like him.<eos> I do, but...
Will you be going up to your study?<eos> No, not as yet.<eos> Ah, yes. Home again.<eos> Home again.<eos> Mrs Munro!<eos> It would appear we've had a decrease in population.<eos> Did Mr Healy not come by to take care of the apiary whilst I was gone?<eos> Yes, but he won't be able to do it next time.<eos> - Did Mr Healy say that?<eos> - No, his daughter did.
They're all you care about!<eos> No!<eos> I care about Roger.<eos> I care about him very much.<eos> The bees...<eos> Didn't do it.<eos> The bees were not to blame.<eos> It was the wasps!<eos> Roger was trying to find out what was killing the bees.<eos> And he did.
Masuo Umezaki.<eos> Maya...<eos> Umezaki.<eos> Ann.<eos> And who is that one for?<eos> Me.<eos> You.<eos> Well, not yet awhile, surely?<eos> Did you finish what you had to do?<eos> Yes, I did.
- But that's not a relationship.<eos> Jack is, is nobody's but mine.<eos> - When he was born, did it, did it ever occur to you... to ask your captor to take Jack away?<eos> Away?<eos> Well, to take him to a hospital, say... Leave him there where he could be found.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> - So Jack could be free.<eos> Now, this is the ultimate sacrifice and I understand that... but did you think about him having a normal childhood?<eos> - But he had me.<eos> - Of course he did.
- I'm starving.<eos> So, where'd Monroe go this morning?<eos> EST.<eos> It's this personal growth workshop thing he's doing in Sacramento.<eos> That's hilarious.<eos> He's trying to better himself.<eos> I think it's noble.<eos> You don't understand him.<eos> - Minnie...<eos> You don't.
Because he doesn't want you to be happy.<eos> He can't deal with the fact that you've moved on, and he hasn't.<eos> You are so full of shit, Monroe!<eos> I've seen you staring at her tits!<eos> My God, are you...<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I don't even know if she has tits.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> Maybe she does, maybe she doesn't.
Is it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hello.<eos> Yeah, there they are.<eos> She's beginning to suspect.<eos> You make it so obvious.<eos> I'm only human, whether you realize it or not.<eos> And I have feelings, too, you know?<eos> But I know how to keep things in check, not let it go too far.<eos> And you, you don't.
What went wrong?<eos> Well, one of Fuller's associates, she's highly trained, possibly ex-military.<eos> I suppose I should thank you for coming back for us.<eos> It's what Kevin would have wanted.<eos> We're even.<eos> You just saved my life.<eos> I guess I did.<eos> Ironic, considering all the times I've wished you dead.<eos> Kevin wanted to get out.<eos> No, he didn't.
What about Matthew?<eos> I can leave him with my mother.<eos> It's just a logistical thing, nothing for you to worry about.<eos> Politics is logistics, son, and I worried plenty, especially about highly trained ex-military woman y'all can't seem to deal with.<eos> Yes, I do have a plan, sir.<eos> Well, good.<eos> Run it by Doug when he gets there.<eos> Uh, sir, I can assure you there is absolutely no need to send Mr. MacArthur.<eos> We have the situation well in hand.<eos> Do you?
Do you think we'll see her again?<eos> Oh, undoubtedly.<eos> We have what she wants.<eos> She wouldn't risk it.<eos> Ha, of course she would.<eos> Ha-ha, talk of the devil.<eos> There you are. I missed you at the hotel.<eos> I didn't miss you.<eos> I want my property.<eos> Well, of course you do.
Before I thought that it was Mom trying to contact me.<eos> But it's not.<eos> It's something else.<eos> - Are you sure it wasn't just a bad dream?<eos> - No!<eos> I saw him.<eos> He had on a mask.<eos> He had on a breathing mask.<eos> I believe you.<eos> I do.
Well, I'm not gonna have to.<eos> Arlen, we can do this.<eos> We can beat them.<eos> We can win!<eos> - I don't care if I win.<eos> - Bullshit!<eos> Everybody wants to win.<eos> No, you want to win. I want to change things.<eos> - I want to win so that I can change things.<eos> - No, you don't!
Why are we drinking it?<eos> What's up?<eos> Ramiro might call you later from jail depending on whether they can get any of his prints off the gun.<eos> No, you got the wrong house.<eos> -You got the wrong kid.<eos> I'm not trying to get into your business.<eos> I just think you need to know what's happening.<eos> No.<eos> -You don't know anything about us.<eos> Actually, I do.
I don't know.<eos> I mean, last I saw, it was still at the dock.<eos> You know, I can't know anymore. I don't want to know.<eos> God, I'd be dying to know.<eos> Yeah, I know you would.<eos> Hey, what the hell?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go to Iceland.<eos> - That sounds great.<eos> - It does.
Emory, it's the only game in town.<eos> How about you?<eos> Me? No. I didn't go to college.<eos> I went right to work.<eos> I was a secretary.<eos> That's interesting.<eos> Is it?<eos> Ah. Here we go.<eos> This smells delicious.<eos> It does.
Well you did your time.<eos> I hope you can let it go now.<eos> When I was in solitary, I had a lot of time to think.<eos> About?<eos> Some things that happened when I was a kid.<eos> Best not to dig up the past, Nora.<eos> I thought about Mum dying, how hard that must have been for you, how lonely.<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> But I do, Dad.
Miss Smith, this is Sergeant Evans.<eos> We have your location.<eos> Stay where you are, we're sending a...<eos> There is a man she is identifying as Nichols as being inside her house.<eos> Now, once again, we do not have independent confirmation... is talking about a woman in Duluth, Georgia, who has called the local police to say...<eos> Visual on them, give me 20 feet.<eos> You two, the second team.<eos> So you're saying you didn't know him at all.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
So, we are not just talking about shoes, Jean.<eos> We're talking about personal expression. We're talking about a wearable diary.<eos> With your help, this store will be the place for people to come when they want to fit in and stand out.<eos> -We overslept. -"We"?<eos> Well, la-di-da.<eos> Details, please.<eos> Did Lance notice that I was missing? Um, yeah.<eos> Oh, he's coming.<eos> Listen, tell him there was a wreck on the 405 and you got trapped in that dead zone next to the Getty so you didn't have cell service.<eos> Okay, do it, do it.
♪ And I'd do anything just to see her face ♪ ♪ But she's far... ♪<eos> [ding] -I'm sorry.<eos> -Sorry.<eos> Um, James.<eos> I know, I'm Leah.<eos> ♪ Far, far away ♪<eos> ♪ If I could make it right, I'll do just that ♪<eos> Come on, man. That ain't right.<eos> That ain't right.<eos> -Like you never done it.
Maybe some of those Celtic designs, or you could go with something a little more American.<eos> Good afternoon, gentlemen.<eos> Hey, I was wondering if you could take a look at this photograph right here.<eos> I'm a little busy right now, dude.<eos> Can it wait a second?<eos> Sure.<eos> No problem.<eos> You, uh, doing a pentagram?<eos> You want one?<eos> -Maybe I do.
I'm talking statistic-anomaly fuckin' huge.<eos> Every Friday night, like fuckin' clockwork.<eos> Why don't you just cut to the chase and tell me what's on your mind?<eos> The way it appears to me, is they're taking in a shitload of money every Thursday night<eos> and laundering it out through the casino.<eos> You're telling me this because?<eos> Put 'em in an awful bad spot, if someone were to rob them of that money.<eos> It's not like they're going to go crying to the police about someone stealing their dirty cash.<eos> Well, sounds like you've got this all figured out.<eos> I do, except for one piece.
If we get you the shit you need, can you keep him alive?<eos> We get it, can you keep him alive?<eos> Yes or no?<eos> Definitely for longer, but I don't know how long.<eos> You there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, we need to get IVs, pain meds, bandages, clotting agents.<eos> I can get all that for you.<eos> I just need to deliver it in person.<eos> Of course you do.
He transferred to Boise, right?<eos> Theresa, I can't...<eos> You can't disclose any details.<eos> I know, I know. I heard it a million times from Ethan to the point where we barely talked.<eos> Theresa.<eos> I need to know if Ethan is in Boise.<eos> I can't believe you went to the hospital.<eos> Maybe you do have brain damage.<eos> I thought I saw my wife and kid.<eos> Maybe you did.
There seems decomposition? N.<eos> It looks like someone's removi ? .<eos> Very good.<eos> Very observant.<eos> They were removed Sliced. With a dagger, while a? n was alive.<eos> Like elsewhere.<eos> Well, you really He has upset someone.<eos> You do not know the half of it.<eos> Userkare to be a King, I do not recognize the name.<eos> A very impressive if you did.
Give me your hands.<eos> Give me your hands.<eos> There's blood.<eos> What were those things on the other side of the wall?<eos> Wolves.<eos> This is wolf country.<eos> Here.<eos> Take this.<eos> That man almost killed us, Ethan.<eos> Well, he didn't.
Why did you bring me here, Peter?<eos> "Before I built a wall,<eos> I'd ask to know what I was walling in or walling out."<eos> That's Robert Frost.<eos> Which is it?<eos> Is it keeping us in?<eos> Or something else out?<eos> Why don't you tell me?<eos> Most people want to leave when they first get here, just like you.<eos> But I didn't.
But I didn't.<eos> It let me be someone new, you know, forget my past.<eos> Problem is, you can't forget forever.<eos> It'll catch up to you.<eos> It's caught up to me.<eos> There's only one way out.<eos> But this is the end for me.<eos> you don't have to do this.<eos> You're right.<eos> You do.
Oh, the hell with it.<eos> Cooper, are you seeing this?<eos> Cooper, are you there?<eos> Hello, Cooper?<eos> What are you saying, boy?<eos> Oh, you wanna go out for a walk.<eos> You heard the nice lady they'll throw us back out into the storm!<eos> Dumb dog.<eos> Oh, we don't wanna do that.<eos> Do we?
You know, it wasn't like that...<eos> Don't joke about these things, Fred.<eos> The prostate is serious.<eos> You are always fall for my jokes, Mick.<eos> You've been believing my every word for sixty years.<eos> I invent stories, Fred.<eos> I have to believe in everything in order to make things up.<eos> Do you remember the other day? When you told me you don't remember your parents any more?<eos> No, I don't remember.<eos> Of course you do.
- Yeah?<eos> - You are not a robot.<eos> - Yeah, but how do you know?<eos> I have the weirdest thoughts in my head right now.<eos> I know. I know, babe.<eos> Do you know what a M1 Abrams is?<eos> It's a type of tank.<eos> I could list like 50 types of tanks right now.<eos> When did I learn about tanks?<eos> I didn't.
I shouldn't have said anything.<eos> Because why would he?<eos> You're right.<eos> I can stay.<eos> Europe will be humming at 5 a.m. I know the drill.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you.<eos> Ray is a prick and a narc.<eos> You're gonna tell me that superannuated hippie didn't smoke in his day?<eos> That he still doesn't?
Look, I'm not an expert.<eos> But, I don't know.<eos> - This all seems a little...<eos> - It seems a little strange, doesn't it?<eos> I suppose umm...<eos> I often tell my students that the mind is a whole universe.<eos> I read an article about this.<eos> Regressive hypnosis has made great progress, gentlemen.<eos> Anyway, I hope you didn't... interrupt my classes, to discuss these topics with me.<eos> Or did you?
I know I should hate them.<eos> But they're my family.<eos> I talk to her every day.<eos> She left us.<eos> All of us.<eos> Despite everything my Dad put her through.<eos> You don't believe, do you?<eos> In praying.<eos> I believe in you, Angela.<eos> I do.
There's no need to cut this man's body.<eos> Why does an apparently healthy favourite son of this city... become self-mutilating and homeless at 50?<eos> Cardiac arrest may be how he died, but not why.<eos> - Prepare the body, please.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I think what he's saying is that sometimes in life, you know, you just...<eos> You're asked to leave it alone.<eos> But sometimes you can't.<eos> Do you believe that he thinks this is a time that I should leave it alone?<eos> No, I don't.
We need a goddamn drink.<eos> I solved the problem.<eos> all they have to do is put on the side of the helmet,<eos> " The Surgeon General has determined that... " " playing football is hazardous to your health. "<eos> You got to put it on both sides of the helmet.<eos> Did you know that Paul Tagliabue, this is the former Commissioner Tagliabue, did you know that Paul was a partner in Covington and Burling?<eos> Which is the same law firm... that represented the big seven tobacco companies.<eos> Of course he was.<eos> But now they're representing the National football League.<eos> Of course they do.
Crazy, man!<eos> Goddammit!<eos> Hey, Cricket.<eos> Goddamit!<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, listen, I've had a hell of a day. I just broke out of a hospital.<eos> What the hell you laughing at, it's true!<eos> These fuckin' guys tried to kill me.<eos> They did!
- Stealing.<eos> - Twice.<eos> Twice!<eos> - Will you spare him?<eos> Or do you lust for justice?<eos> Justice!<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Justice!<eos> - Do they ever have mercy?<eos> - Oh, yes. They do.
- My child.<eos> - I know that.<eos> Why do you act so pious?<eos> It's pathetic.<eos> It's a good thing you never had children.<eos> Oh, I'm sure you think that.<eos> You would.<eos> - Don't presume to know me.<eos> - I can see why she never came here.<eos> She just did.
No. What...?<eos> Come on, Billy.<eos> Come on, calm down. Come on.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> No one's gonna care.<eos> Come on, Billy.<eos> Let me go!<eos> I still gotta take you back, Billy.<eos> You don't know what goes on in that place.<eos> Sure I do.
He's most likely their senior member in the United States.<eos> What do you know about his brother?<eos> I wasn't aware he had one.<eos> Guillermo.<eos> His brother's name is Guillermo.<eos> Do you know anything about his cousin?<eos> I didn't know he had one of those either.<eos> None of that is in his file. His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> No one does.
Un-fucking real!<eos> Front and back.<eos> Kate.<eos> Kate, come on.<eos> Fuck these people, man.<eos> They've been using us from the beginning.<eos> We don't have to do this.<eos> I need to know what they used us for.<eos> Doesn't matter what!<eos> Yes, it does!
- Yeah.<eos> They abandoned their moon missions in the 70s.<eos> Maybe they made it, but kept it a secret?<eos> He didn't burn to death.<eos> Fortunately, and I know we just met I think you're socio-centric, which gives you hope.<eos> I mean, that you can, if you sort of face it head on... can help that stagnated individual get beyond... that sort of... I would say immature... stagnation in their development, cognitive development.<eos> Of course, it's not your job to be anyone's clinician.<eos> You know, I'm not saying you have to, you know, put on a lab coat or anything.<eos> Although I think you'd look great in a lab coat.<eos> I do.
Oh great, we've only been out here for hours.<eos> You've got a good base Chanda, you'll be fine.<eos> That's great, I'm right here.<eos> What happened last night?<eos> The fucking sand killed my boyfriend is what.<eos> Okay, how, when, what changed, what happened?<eos> Who cares!<eos> Get me out of here!<eos> Yeah, Gilbert's right, does it matter?<eos> Yeah, it does.
But that's why I don't want him to ruin it again.<eos> Look, we can postpone the reopening.<eos> That's not a problem.<eos> But there's press in town.<eos> And there isn't a whaling village in the entire world that can hold the news cycle like the story of a broken-hearted little angel.<eos> A girl who loves her dog...<eos> --..she grew up loving.<eos> And, Your Honour, since it is ultimately your decision, well, I guess every story needs its villain.<eos> Mr Slater does make a valid point.<eos> Yes, he does.
Oh, yeah, sorry.<eos> I forgot. There's an even better reason to leave soon.<eos> - Well, spit it out.<eos> - Yeah, give, professor.<eos> What's got you so spooked?<eos> Well, every year, sharks swarm, sometimes 15,000 in an area less than two miles wide.<eos> They define hunting territory, mate, devour everything in sight, then move on.<eos> I'm concerned that what we've got in the front yard is just a scouting party waiting on a thousand of their dearest friends.<eos> No, this doesn't sound good at all.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Somewhere in there.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> What's on next?<eos> Algiers, starring Hedy Lamarr.<eos> Have you seen that?<eos> Um, no.<eos> It's one of the greats.<eos> And Hedy Lamarr is fascinating.<eos> She invented, uh-- She invented frequency hopping.<eos> No, she didn't.
All right, bro.<eos> What you want, a scooby snack or some shit, man?<eos> I'm just saying. You always trying to act like I'm not paying attention and shit.<eos> Call it correct.<eos> We saw you at the diner.<eos> Saw you following us and shit.<eos> You have fun?<eos> What the fuck do you want, man?<eos> I want to know who did the drive-by on one of your corners.<eos> Oh, you do?
Looks good.<eos> - All right. Let's take a picture.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> - That's a good one.<eos> Do another one. - Okay, okay.<eos> - Different pose.<eos> - Hold on. Okay.<eos> How do we know if Alonzo's even here?<eos> We don't.
I need to find him.<eos> Fast.<eos> Ten years ago this place was a school.<eos> It's just me here now.<eos> I've lost my wife, I've lost the farm.<eos> I don't want to lose my son.<eos> - Bedwyr's asthmatic, isn't he? - Yes.<eos> - Does he smoke?<eos> - No.<eos> - Somebody with him does.
You're taking my legs out from under me here.<eos> - Is the Terrace Café open for lunch?<eos> - Yes, it is. I'm out.<eos> Bring it in, Heath.<eos> Little tighter, bring it in.<eos> Yes.<eos> Just a little bit closer range. I can't let this out.<eos> But it seems to be that I'm going to be delivering the keynote speech tonight at the security officers' convention.<eos> You know, I think they canceled that.<eos> They didn't.
- Yeah, that'd be terrific.<eos> - Yeah. - Vegas, baby!<eos> - Let's hit the tables!<eos> Have her call me if you want to get her nails done or whatever.<eos> Problem?<eos> They've already upgraded the lock on Mr. Van Gogh to the dual control.<eos> You said the upgrades weren't scheduled till tomorrow.<eos> Because that is what the security e-mail said.<eos> Now, I do have a guy on the inside who was supposed to alert me if the schedule changed.<eos> Obviously, he didn't.
"We live as we dream." "Alone."<eos> Turns out I am giving thekeynoteafterall , so it'd mean a lot if you could be there, peanut.<eos> You were supposed to tell me<eos> - if the schedule got moved.<eos> - Let's calm down. And no one told me anything.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Get her.<eos> And yet, when people ask me, "Why do you do it?" I have to laugh.<eos> 'Cause they think I have a choice.<eos> I don't.
Are you with anyone?<eos> Are you with anyone?<eos> No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I have to find it.<eos> Okay, it must be this way.<eos> I walked that direction.<eos> I could not find any trail.<eos> You don't want to leave.<eos> I do.
So... why end your life?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> If god is not waiting for you on the other side, who is?<eos> Why do you want to die?<eos> I'm here sightseeing.<eos> For sightseeing?<eos> What?<eos> I don't know who the hell you are but I stopped to help you.<eos> - You did.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Takumi.<eos> That your whole name?<eos> Nakamura takumi.<eos> Tell me about your family.<eos> My wife kiiro she's so smart charming.<eos> We have one daughter, fuyu.<eos> Sorry I yelled at you, earlier.<eos> Maybe I deserved.<eos> No.<eos> No, you didn't.
What the fuck I tell you about talking, huh?<eos> I'll bust you in the mouth right in front of these people.<eos> I don't give a fuck! You never gave your name, sir.<eos> John Ruth.<eos> Are you a lawman?<eos> I'm taking her to the law.<eos> So you're a bounty hunter?<eos> That's right, buster.<eos> Do you have a warrant?<eos> Yeah, course I do.
It's Oswaldo Mobray.<eos> Oswaldo?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well<eos> I got my warrant, Oswaldo.<eos> I take it you're Daisy Domergue? That's her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I see.<eos> Uh, it says here 'Dead or Alive. Yeah.<eos> It does.
Thank you.<eos> What did she mean when she said "The bounty hunter's nigger friend in the stable"?<eos> He's got a nigger bounty hunter friend in the stable.<eos> But all that just to guard her?<eos> Uh, I don't think that was the original idea, but that's the idea now. Oh!<eos> Mm. Want a little snake bite in your coffee?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Five of you?<eos> Well, well, well, looks like Minnie's Haberdashery is about to get cozy for the next few days.<eos> Yes, it does.
But I still ain't done it yet.<eos> Minnie still serve food?<eos> Do you consider stew food?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then we serve food.<eos> She still stinking up the place with Old Quail pipe tobacco?<eos> Minnie doesn't smoke a pipe. She rolls her own.<eos> Red Apple Tobacco.<eos> But, mi negro amigo, I think you already know this.<eos> Yeah, I do, Senor Bob.
Oh, yeah.<eos> That's nice.<eos> So how you doing, Black Major?<eos> I ain't in the mood, Chris Mannix.<eos> Leave me be from your horseshit.<eos> John Ruth says you got a Lincoln letter.<eos> I told you, jackass, go hee-haw someplace else.<eos> That's right, John.<eos> You did say that, didn't you?<eos> Yeah, I did.
General Smithers, don't you listen to him.<eos> He didn't know your boy. He just heard tell why you're here, is all.<eos> It was cold the day I killed your boy.<eos> And I don't mean snowy-mountain-Wyoming cold, uh-uh.<eos> It was colder than that.<eos> And on that cold day, with your boy at the business end of my gun barrel I made him strip right down to his bare ass.<eos> Then I told him to start walkin.<eos> I walked his naked ass for two hours 'fore the cold collapsed him.<eos> You never even knew my boy?<eos> No, he didn't!
So when you tell me Minnie went to the north side to visit her mama well, I find that highly unlikely. But okay, maybe.<eos> But when you tell me Minnie Mink took the haberdashery the most precious thing to her in the whole world and left it in the hands of a goddamn Mexican?<eos> Well, that's what I meant in the barn when I said that sure don't sound like Minnie.<eos> Now I am calling you a liar Senor Bob.<eos> And if you lyin' which you are then you killed Minnie.<eos> And Sweet Dave.<eos> Four measly bullets and there goes Senor Bob.<eos> But that still don't get us no closer to which one of y'all poisoned the coffee, though.<eos> Do it, Chris?<eos> No, it sure don't.
and he's gonna have my sister with him. And he is gonna have her in chains.<eos> He's taking her to Red Rock to be hung.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> No.<eos> $10,000.<eos> That's why.<eos> Now, when he gets here I'm gonna kill that fella and turn my sister loose.<eos> Now, do you have any reason why you would want to interfere with me saving my sister from a hangman's rope?<eos> No.<eos> You don't?

No deal, tramp.<eos> Chris! You're making the biggest mistake of your life!<eos> When our boys get here in a couple of days they're gonna cut your nuts off!<eos> And there won't be a stick left in that town unburnt!<eos> Well, I guess I should be plumb scared right now, huh?<eos> If you had any brains you would be!<eos> You see<eos> here 's the problem, Daisy.<eos> In order for me to be scared of your threats I got to believe in those 15 extra gang members waiting it out in Red Rock.<eos> And ,boy oh, boy, I sure don't.
That's enough.<eos> Show my parents some respect.<eos> They are playing you music.<eos> - That's OK.<eos> - No, Mother, it is not OK.<eos> Please continue.<eos> Do you want us to perform the same piece or something else?<eos> Something else.<eos> Didn't her parents play beautifully?<eos> Yes, they did.
Now that you two are friends, you can go hunt animals with my dad, right?<eos> So we can have real food more often.<eos> I think that's a good idea.<eos> I can help your dad hunt... and he can help me go get ammunition... and other supplies in the store.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think you don't need my dad's help to go into town.<eos> You, when you were a kid, did you know how to add and subtract?<eos> Well, not much.<eos> I tell you what, not much now neither.<eos> Well, I do.
Please, Faye, you got to work with me.<eos> The trial will be over in another week.<eos> Then, I'll take a vacation and find someone else.<eos> I promise.<eos> And leave here again with her?<eos> It's just for another week.<eos> What am I gonna do without Hamlet?<eos> He's a cat.<eos> He'll find his way home.<eos> They always do.
- How are you?<eos> - Intense.<eos> Intense.<eos> I just heard that Whole Foods are gonna be carrying my pickles nationally, so...<eos> Yeah, we'll have to expand production post haste!<eos> That's amazing.<eos> So I'm just manning the stall.<eos> Get away from the chaos at the factory.<eos> Well... Do you still have those Bavarian pickles?<eos> Sure do.
- Thank God it's Friday.<eos> - I know.<eos> So I was thinking if we take all the kids ice-skating, then you can take Justine to that movie.<eos> - No, it won't!<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> I'll take you and Lily to something else.<eos> Why don't we see what's playing?<eos> Justine, where are the Band-Aids?<eos> - Have you heard from John?<eos> - I did.
No more ideas, period.<eos> You've had your thinking license revoked.<eos> I'm not gonna get involved with anybody's fate ever again.<eos> Not even my own.<eos> I'm gonna become a completely passive, non-interventional<eos> Buddhist.<eos> But I think that if you just saw him, you guys just...<eos> You have to let this go, Maggie.<eos> This story has its own momentum, apart from you.<eos> It always did.
- It's so good.<eos> Oh, how's that?<eos> Go ahead, Michelle.<eos> You know it, bitch.<eos> Whoa. I'm gonna snort.<eos> - That's dirty.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Rebel!<eos> They look like they're having so much fun.<eos> Yeah, they do.
You need to pay a mechanic a visit.<eos> Get your gauge right.<eos> Need a little more juice.<eos> MAN: That's right.<eos> I got the juice! MAN:<eos> Yes!<eos> Jesus...<eos> Hallelujah. ALL: Hallelujah.<eos> I got the juice.<eos> Yes, you do.
He didn't say.<eos> That's weird, man.<eos> It's a job interview!<eos> All right.<eos> Forget it. A job is a job.<eos> We go by there tomorrow then.<eos> No, no.<eos> He said to come through tonight. 11:00.<eos> I can't believe that Mom let you borrow the car. (INDISTINCT CHATTER)<eos> She didn't. What?
She was surprised to hear you're coming in every day.<eos> God is our refuge and strength.<eos> A very present hope in times of trouble.<eos> Psalm 46.<eos> One of my favorites.<eos> But how are you doing?<eos> I'm... I'm scared, Father.<eos> Cast thy burden unto the Lord and he shall sustain thee.<eos> I have faith in God's strength, believe me.<eos> I do.
Deacon's a match and you are not?<eos> That's the situation.<eos> No wonder you two are not close.<eos> Alright.<eos> There is the question of money.<eos> My doctor friend has a price of $20,000 American.<eos> Look... Deacon, I don't have that kind of cash on hand. Do you?<eos> George, what about you?<eos> For God's sakes, no.<eos> I do.
You have a brother?<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Shocked I was to receive such a request from yourself.<eos> As you know I'm a simple honest janitor these days in this lovely old theater.<eos> I have this.<eos> You see that?<eos> I'm limited to one block around my house and my work.<eos> And if I'm caught even near a computer I go straight back to jail to serve out the rest of my sentence.<eos> - You of all people know this.<eos> - I do.
I did.<eos> Look... can we do this? I can do it.<eos> But I worry about what you might think about me breaking my promise to Jesus, my savior.<eos> My daughter, Isabella... she's on the recipient list.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> George, I owe you.<eos> So listen to me.<eos> You don't really want the list.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> No, you don't.
You don't belong here at all.<eos> Do you... Philippe?<eos> I knew it!<eos> Philippe Petit.<eos> Daredevil wire walker.<eos> I saw you in Paris on top of the Notre-Dame Cathedral.<eos> Yes!<eos> -Yes, wow.<eos> You know, the cops had absolutely no idea what to do with you.<eos> They never do.
All civilians are innocent.<eos> Act like the bullets have eyes.<eos> Then, how about taking a photo?<eos> For the historical record.<eos> Comrade Ahn, you can change clothes.<eos> Okay.<eos> We can't fight on an empty stomach<eos> Captain Yem said you would cover our compensation.<eos> What's with you?<eos> He did.
Damn it!<eos> I'm 30, I haven't had time to do anything.<eos> All day on the sofa, no trips, no wild stuff...<eos> - Now you think of that?<eos> - Travel is overrated.<eos> Well, you were never home.<eos> All your life out saving the world, you forgot about me.<eos> Since I'm going to die, I'll get it off my chest:<eos> Secret agents don't have kids.<eos> James Bond didn't, or Jason Bourne.
- The other one?<eos> - It's empty.<eos> - There's nobody in there?<eos> There he is!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Open it.<eos> I find out that she's hurt, or you even so much as fucking touched her, then I'm gonna make you pay. - Understand?<eos> - I didn't touch her, Holmes.<eos> I swear.<eos> Nobody did.
When do we announce the nomination?<eos> Listen, I wasn't gonna bring this up tonight, but you should know that there are some serious doubts from people at the State Department.<eos> You mean Cathy.<eos> And some on her staff.<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, in over your head, wearing two hats, the obvious things.<eos> And are you saying this because you don't want to move forward?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm sharing with you so you fully understand - what you're getting into.<eos> - And I do.
Back in the circle in five... four... three... two... one!<eos> South wins!<eos> Who the fuck tries to fast draw with a Desert Eagle, huh?<eos> Just admit you've got a small dick, save yourself pain and money.<eos> Colt.<eos> - John.<eos> - John.<eos> Kind of ballsy giving him a breath after that first shot, huh?<eos> He might've knocked one back at you.<eos> He didn't.
I, uh, I sold...<eos> I sold computers.<eos> Big-screen TVs, stereos.<eos> Well, you asked what I did before.<eos> About 100 years ago.<eos> Yeah... that's about how long it takes.<eos> I went to watch, at first.<eos> Because that's who I was... a spectator.<eos> And this kid, maybe 20, he had this look on his face... like this was one more thing he was gonna fail at.<eos> And he did.
No, I know.<eos> I know, Frankie, I'm sorry.<eos> You're going to school, and I need to get your socks on.<eos> I don't wanna go to school!<eos> Stop! Do not kick me because--<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, Frankie, okay.<eos> Why are you so upset right now?<eos> I don't want to go to school.<eos> You don't? No.
- What?<eos> Where you been?<eos> You want some of this or what?<eos> - 'Cause I'm not waiting around.<eos> - Depends.<eos> On what?<eos> - You want some of me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
Luckily Yannis broke them up, otherwise the Doctor would have cut him to pieces.<eos> Yannis got hurt too. He got stabbed in the knee.<eos> - Goodnight.<eos> - Goodnight.<eos> It probably cut a tendon, but if you see Christos's face you won't believe it.<eos> Nikolaou left in tears, the rest are down in their cabins.<eos> An ambulance is on its way.<eos> Christos lost a lot of blood.<eos> You believed it.<eos> No I didn't.

The Weed of Christmas Present.<eos> I'm an athlete, so drug-free body.<eos> Drug-free zone. No smoking.<eos> You buying that for somebody and you're not gonna test it?<eos> That could be oregano.<eos> - Orega-what?<eos> - Oregano.<eos> So....<eos> Something special supposed to happen?<eos> It just did.
Not that long. She wanted to get serious, but he wouldn't meet her parents.<eos> She wanted to move in... and you said you weren't in the right head place for her to move in.<eos> That's some straight-up bullshit.<eos> Give me some, Ma.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> What, are you guys ganging up on me now?<eos> You like this woman?<eos> Yeah, she's awesome... but there's a whole history here that he's brushing over.<eos> You want her back?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Jesus. I mean, it's a dope dick.<eos> Dope dick homey.<eos> Tx. Do you want it?<eos> Do I want it?<eos> Of course I want a dick like that.<eos> Who wouldn't want a dick that looks like that?<eos> Do you want to suck it?<eos> Do I wanna suck it? Oh, man.<eos> I'm gonna start putting people's last names on my contacts.<eos> No I don't.
- Yeah.<eos> Why did you choose this picture for the home page of your computer?<eos> It's the last one taken of us together.<eos> Was there anything significant about that day?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Lindy, whatever he wants to tell you by sending you this picture could help us find Reese.<eos> In the original picture, your sister's wearing a bracelet, but in the replica, she's not.<eos> Why?<eos> - I didn't think anyone noticed.<eos> - I did.
Sorry, you forfeited that right.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm not sorry I wrote that piece.<eos> It's important.<eos> People are dying. Shh!<eos> I am trying to throw a party.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Detective Yaeger, can you please escort my dis-invited best friend out?<eos> Really?<eos> So, um, nobody does flowers anymore.
Oh, God, I'm gonna have to clear out her apartment.<eos> Does she have any family?<eos> Some, but they were a mess.<eos> She was the one that got away.<eos> Made a life.<eos> And now she's dead.<eos> For two years, Erika was on the Unos list for a new heart.<eos> Worked her way to the top but got so sick, her doctors put her on a drug trial to bridge the time 'til<eos> - an organ became available.<eos> - And one never did?
So...<eos> You get a date out of this little adventure?<eos> Well, as you said, a cop and a neurosurgeon, not exactly a match.<eos> Sure about that?<eos> - Give me a minute.<eos> Thanks for helping us.<eos> Erika created a perfect virus, but she never meant to hurt anyone.<eos> She just became obsessed.<eos> I don't think I understand that kind of obsession.<eos> I do.
No.<eos> Except she's totally freaked.<eos> Who would do this?<eos> Iluxa Electronic.<eos> They booked the apartment online.<eos> I thought maybe you could see who came in and out of the apartment.<eos> You should go to the police.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I'm this close to getting offered the job of a lifetime with Jake's law firm.<eos> They do thorough background checks.
I snoop because I love you.<eos> Sophia, no.<eos> Okay, we have been friends a long time.<eos> I...<eos> Okay, look, I will always support you, through anything.<eos> Bipolar disorder or whatever it may be...<eos> Sophia... But I looked into these drugs, and it's really bad to drink while taking them.<eos> So maybe that's something you need to rethink.<eos> Sophia, it doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
The killer led me down here, left me a phone to find.<eos> Can you trace it?<eos> Yeah, I... I guess, I... It's just gonna take some time.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Kent is out.<eos> It's not him we want to see.<eos> We spoke to Jennifer Marino.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Yes, you do.
You couldn't get to him so you used Lindy.<eos> And your point?<eos> Then you pretended to have information about her sister so she'd actually go through with it.<eos> Who said I was pretending?<eos> - You know about this?<eos> Well, so much for never letting anything happen to her, Tommy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So much for staying neutral.<eos> For God's sake, Catherine, if you have information about that girl's sister, you have to let her know.<eos> Do I?
- Second Lieutenant Sand.<eos> "You are in my charge and you will be escorted to the barracks."<eos> Ich hätte eine Frage.<eos> He wants to know why we kept fighting.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It was an unnecessary waste of lives.<eos> Our government had already capitulated.<eos> Didn't you know that?<eos> No, I did not.
What do you mean?<eos> Well, officially.<eos> I-I was her next of kin.<eos> I'm sure I told you this before, Kate.<eos> I think I would remember my husband being another woman's next of kin.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why what?<eos> Well, why were you her next of kin?<eos> Because they thought we were married.<eos> - Who did?
I sometimes think it's a shame not to have more photos around the house.<eos> We could put some up.<eos> Yeah, but we don't have any.<eos> Not really.<eos> I mean, not like Lena does with her wall display.<eos> I suppose it's because they've got children and grandchildren, and...<eos> I guess we didn't see the point of taking pictures of ourselves.<eos> Would have been a bit vain.<eos> You used to say that everybody taking pictures all the time stopped anyone having any fun.<eos> - Did I?
Is he smoking again?<eos> Looks like it.<eos> You should get him to shave before the big day too.<eos> - Hello, Geoffrey.<eos> - Hello, Lena.<eos> Hope you've got your speech prepared.<eos> I want to hear nice things about Kate on Saturday.<eos> So, I hear you don't want to go to the Crawley's lunch.<eos> I don't mind if you don't, but I wondered why.<eos> I just don't.
I can hear your heart.<eos> Yeah, well, I'd hope so.<eos> Boom, boom. Boom. It's getting faster now.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah. It's just a headache.<eos> I'm actually not supposed to be leaving my bed.<eos> Well, I'm glad you're okay.<eos> I'm glad you're okay.<eos> I never really thought about it before, but... last night made me realize how... at any day, any point... we could just die.<eos> We didn't.
I just put the kettle on.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> Go on.<eos> Sit down anywhere you like.<eos> Needs a bit of warming up.<eos> So...<eos> What do you think?<eos> Do you think that we look alike, me and Reggie?<eos> Oh, yes, certainly.<eos> No, you don't.
Have you got one of those?<eos> Wife, children, friends.<eos> A dog.<eos> Someone waiting for you somewhere?<eos> Yeah, I got plenty of people waiting for me.<eos> Plenty.<eos> How many?<eos> Hookers don't count.<eos> - Hookers don't count?<eos> - No, they don't.
It's my grandfather.<eos> B, tell Damir to get over here.<eos> Oprostite. Excuse me.<eos> It's our fault.<eos> Tell him the road was closed.<eos> We couldn't make it back last night.<eos> And Nikola behaved very well.<eos> Tell him... that Nikola took us to his house in Dukovo.<eos> He asks if boy went into the house.<eos> No, he didn't.
Yeah.<eos> Ryan, that man's grief was heartbreaking, but you can't blame yourself for his daughter's death.<eos> You were doing your job.<eos> I know.<eos> How many more people would Joe Carroll have killed if you hadn't stopped him?<eos> But so many lost their lives, you know, and it's easy to see them as just an extension of Joe, but I don't even recognize that name--Sherry.<eos> The more I really think about it, there's only a handful of names that I do remember.<eos> Joe Carroll turned those people into killers.<eos> But their lives, their families should still matter.<eos> And they do.
Wait for me.<eos> Please, please, please, just fucking stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop...<eos> This is barmy!<eos> No-one could hide down there.<eos> Ever get the feeling you're being hunted, Tubs?<eos> Stop calling me that.<eos> I ain't even fat.<eos> And, no, I don't.
I wouldn't want to be near one of them dirty bastards.<eos> Come on, Tubs, keep up.<eos> General?<eos> Is your suitcase ready?<eos> She died.<eos> Of Spanish influenza, after the war.<eos> Who?<eos> My wife Lesley.<eos> After all that, she died of the Spanish flu.<eos> So many did.
Very well, Doctor.<eos> We said singly or in a group.<eos> I'm going to read.<eos> I'm sorry, Dr Armstrong, but your agitation tires me greatly.<eos> LOMBARD: "Justice came."<eos> The killer and Wargrave having common cause, the same thrill... from handing out death.<eos> You took the piss when I said the Judge.<eos> Yes, well, now I think different.<eos> How many men has he seen dangle?<eos> What does that do to someone?
Women are the worst.<eos> I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong.<eos> No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.<eos> What happened now?<eos> Amy has ended our relationship.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Seriously?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Amy broke up with Sheldon.<eos> She did?
Evan, I have something to confess.<eos> Yes?<eos> I'm glad we knocked on your door.<eos> I'm having a way better time here then at that stupid party we were supposed to go to.<eos> Well, I have to confess, it's not usually this exciting around here at 1:30 in the morning.<eos> It's like destiny that we were meant to meet.<eos> Do you believe in destiny, Evan?<eos> I'm an architect.<eos> So obviously I believe that things happen by your own design.<eos> Well, I do.
I'm a good father!<eos> Until yesterday.<eos> That doesn't change how much I love them!<eos> Do you really love them, Evan?<eos> Really?<eos> More than anything in the world.<eos> So why didn't you think of them when you were inside us?<eos> Yeah, why, Evan?<eos> Last night had nothing to do with my family.<eos> Damn right it didn't, Evan!
So this is the holy city of the Jews?<eos> Why don't they hail their new governor?<eos> I don't come seeking their love, Claudia, only respect.<eos> How do I dress when we are taken to see the Jewish God?<eos> No one sees him.<eos> They believe hes everywhere.<eos> Everywhere?<eos> But cannot be seen?<eos> How do they know he exists?<eos> Maybe he doesn't.
Lei the mob see... who is truly fit to be king of the Jews.<eos> We shall release you!<eos> Blessing for the prophet!<eos> I'm told you work miracles.<eos> Do something.<eos> Anything wondrous.<eos> Make bread fall from the heavens.<eos> Feed us a morning meal.<eos> My preference is lentils and barley.<eos> Do something!
So... how come you came back?<eos> Work, as usual.<eos> Are you shooting a movie in Bacau?<eos> No, it's a TV thing.<eos> Oh, what's it about?<eos> Uh, it's a reality show,<eos> And we're looking for an Eastern European girl...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who can speak a bit of Italian.<eos> Oh, well... I do.
He's out of town now.<eos> And won't be back until tomorrow evening.<eos> We'll be leaving from here in seven hours.<eos> So you better rest a little.<eos> Solider.<eos> 100 if you tell me where Sofia is.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Where is Sofia?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who does?
I'll be lookout.<eos> You can do whatever you want, Q.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Dad, I'm sorry, okay?<eos> "I'm sorry"?<eos> That's completely unacceptable.<eos> I really like him, Dad!<eos> He does not love you!<eos> Yes, he does!
That's the problem.<eos> No one ever looks at me and thinks that I'm smart... or clever... or interesting, you know?<eos> I have a brain. I'm going to Dartmouth.<eos> So, uh... Is that what you're upset about?<eos> Becca and I got in a fight.<eos> She called me a bitch and a whore.<eos> And then she stood on a couch and shushed the entire party and told them I have chlamydia.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Which, I don't.
We received your letter and your demands.<eos> We are prepared to pay the sum you requested for Abigail Ashe.<eos> I am not Charles Vane.<eos> I have no demands.<eos> But I do have a request.<eos> Captain James Flint.<eos> You're Captain Flint?<eos> I am.<eos> And you wish an audience with Lord Ashe?<eos> I do.
I've been coming here.<eos> Are you just gonna stand up here while your sister gets her ass beat?<eos> Come on.<eos> I've been traveling here.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> I've been headed here, like a freight train.<eos> I couldn't have known then where all this was gonna end up.<eos> I didn't know why he decided to come back.<eos> I didn't know then what he's running from .<eos> None of us did.
- Because this doesn't make sense.<eos> - Which part?<eos> You're always on rne about how I don't talk to Mom enough, how I don't respect the family.<eos> Now I tell you I wanna come home, and I wanna help out, and that doesn't make sense to you.<eos> You know what, I'm sorry.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You want me to talk to Dad, I'll talk to Dad.<eos> Of course I will.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Doesn't hurt, does it?<eos> This is a sanctuary.<eos> The people who've joined us, they're trying to get away from people like you.<eos> -Sister Amy.<eos> -Are we really that bad?<eos> You'd remind them of things they left behind.<eos> And many of those are painful.<eos> You're doctors.<eos> I'm sure you don't want to cause pain.<eos> No. We don't.
- Last name's fine.<eos> - ( without accent ) P-E-Y-T-O-N.<eos> Oh, I was spelling it with an A.<eos> ( with accent ) Ah, that always happens when I give my name to people.<eos> We have you down for 2:00 PM tomorrow.<eos> ( without accent ) You do?<eos> I just want to confirm.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Someone's got good news.<eos> Someone does.
Yes, but it turned out that Emma Wilson and Yussef Khalid are connected.<eos> How?<eos> I went into the apartment and he was there.<eos> - Looking for something.<eos> - What?<eos> We didn't exactly exchange niceties.<eos> He got the jump on me.<eos> Got me on my knees.<eos> Thought he was gonna kill me.<eos> Why didn't he?
Great warrior?<eos> He swings a sword like a girl with palsy.<eos> My lord.<eos> Sword up, my lord!<eos> Some boys develop more slowly.<eos> He's still young.<eos> He's 13.<eos> Boys go to war at 13.<eos> - He has other gifts.<eos> - Does he?
~ living cheek by jowl with a lot of students. ~ No, I don't.<eos> I want to live in a spotless flat... with you. Say you will, Pats. Think of the fun we'd have.<eos> I don't have to live at Nonnatus, it was offered to me as a sort of perk.<eos> Lots of girls share flats.<eos> Not even a nun would bat an eyelid.<eos> BELL TINKLES<eos> Good morning, madam.<eos> I'm your fiance's daughter. Marlene Dooley, nee Buckle. You remember me?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I do. ~ Oh, what a lovely surprise. ~ Good.
Should.<eos> Built to last the full Ares mission.<eos> So, technically, it's only half way through it's lifespan.<eos> - But, if something goes wrong.<eos> - Then, we lose the crew.<eos> So, what?<eos> We, either have a high chance of killing 1 person, or low chance of killing 6 people.<eos> How do we make that decision?<eos> We don't have to make it, Bruce.<eos> He does.
But am I a friend to you, as Mr. Sofoyan is to you, and Amin?<eos> You dine all together.<eos> You go to the theatre.<eos> But in 20 years, I have not even shared table with you.<eos> - Get used to it.<eos> If they don't say your name, thank God.<eos> If they do, say a prayer.<eos> He knew his end was near.<eos> - How did he know?<eos> - He just did.
- Working on it.<eos> - Who the hell is that?<eos> - It's Umair Zaman, the former general. He's ex-ISI leader.<eos> He's our guy.<eos> He was our handpicked guy until he turned radical.<eos> He's still got a lot of support in the army. He's head of the Pakistani Unity Party, ran in the last election, lost, contested the results. I guess he's not bothering to wait around for a recount.<eos> Looks like he's in charge now. There...<eos> Ah, sound.<eos> - Who speaks Urdu?<eos> - I do, sir.
The other night on the stairs, I saw one for real.<eos> Where were you?<eos> In the Congo.<eos> Leopard was gonna have a baby.<eos> You think I'm not making sense...<eos> ..but I am.<eos> You weren't worried, were you?<eos> Nah.<eos> Can you imagine being told you've got it?<eos> Well, we don't.
- It was probably you, John.<eos> - Yes, you go through it.<eos> - Hurts my lungs to laugh.<eos> - Oh, sorry.<eos> And the boy videos - your family would enjoy Frisky Pool Party 7.<eos> That's right!<eos> Tim, the car isn't yours.<eos> No, but I need it.<eos> John told Lois that you had to have a scan.<eos> Did he, now?
Yes, all right!<eos> Good, okay.<eos> Let us start here.<eos> If you are firm in your resolve it, not to cooperate with the U.S. government...<eos> I am.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Then do not talk to anybody else about your case. Inside of government or outside.<eos> Except to me, to the extent that you trust me.<eos> I have a mandate to serve you.<eos> Nobody else does.
DINESHZ Okay.<eos> You and I both have to get ready for a board meeting.<eos> Can we just stop with the nonsense?<eos> - Nonsense?<eos> - Yeah. - This is nonsense?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know, half the yogurt's gonna go unused because one quarter of the jam can't come out.<eos> MONICA: Thank you for hosting.<eos> You have a lovely home.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Lawsuits happen.<eos> So, questions?<eos> - Oh, uh, I have a question.<eos> Mmm-hmm. My best friend's nickname is Cunty.<eos> - I'm sorry, her name is...<eos> - Cunty. And I was hoping I could call her Cunty while I'm here.<eos> Okay, that one's easy.<eos> No, you cannot. 'Cause, you know, I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch, and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty," then it's like, I'm not going to want to have Cunty over at all, which I feel, like, kind of violates my rights.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, it does not...
Yeah, you really shouldn't be looking at that. That's all proprietary.<eos> "Opportunities, fuck Gina"?<eos> Would you believe that was here when we came in?<eos> Double-A? Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Leave me alone for a sec.<eos> What's up?<eos> - Well, okay.<eos> I just saw a version of the player window that apparently you approved of that says Powered by Homicide on it?<eos> Oh, yeah, it does.
And we took time away from doing that to do this so we could get PR value.<eos> If no one sees the logo, then there's no PR value at all.<eos> Oh, man. I'm sorry.<eos> But you get it.<eos> No, I don't get it.<eos> Okay, look, you have to put our logo in the viewer.<eos> That's it, period. Mmm...<eos> Actually, I don't have to do a damn thing.<eos> - Yeah, you do.<eos> - No, I don't.
It means "asshole."<eos> You know what "bro" means in Portuguese? "Rapist."<eos> In Latvian, it roughly translates to "one who beheads the messiah."<eos> In Finnish, "bro" means "a baby's erection."<eos> In Urdu, "bro" is actually short for... which means "a dildo for a man."<eos> A man's dildo.<eos> "Fecal eclipse."<eos> It loses something in translation.<eos> We don't have a word for it.<eos> They do.
But I think it's important for me to show my dissatisfaction by walking out on you.<eos> Richard, I'd understand if you took it, but watching you end up over there would break my heart.<eos> What, like Julia Roberts from "My Best Friend's Wedding"?<eos> I never saw it.<eos> Richard Hendricks.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Russ Hanneman.<eos> True pleasure to meet you.<eos> Oh, yeah, I think I recognize you from TV.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- That's right.<eos> The Russ Hanneman with whom I am familiar?<eos> Yes.<eos> That-- that is with whom they chose to go?<eos> - Russ Hanneman?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He's a vulgar human being. He's utterly distasteful.<eos> And it would not be inaccurate to say that we at Raviga are now co-investors with Russ Hanneman.<eos> I tried to talk him out of it.<eos> I did, but...
Don't be sorry.<eos> I love my wife, Torvi.<eos> Floki.<eos> Priest.<eos> Lord, receive my soul.<eos> The things I do for you.<eos> For such a little man, Athelstan, you are terribly heavy.<eos> This is as close to your God as I can get you.<eos> I never knew what a martyr was.<eos> I still don't.
and enjoy each other.<eos> You see?<eos> You should never have called me that.<eos> Called you what?<eos> Ironside.<eos> As if the gods are protecting me.<eos> Go.<eos> You're alive, aren't you?<eos> Today went badly.<eos> Yes, it did.
- Am I this?<eos> Noah, you borrowed money from the fucking mob?<eos> It's one of your New Year's resolutions, Noah, become a complete fucking moron?<eos> What do you mean become a moron, he's always been a fucking moron.<eos> I am with ya, I swear, and a guy I know referred me and he borrowed money, he had no problem.<eos> - Noah.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Did he pay it back?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he did.
Frank told me you've been calling the office.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> What were you thinking, Lucy?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Terrence knows about us.<eos> He came home drunk last night talking all sorts of shit, and I don't know.<eos> But don't worry, he ain't going to say nothing.<eos> I think you've had enough.<eos> Don't you think you've fucking had enough?<eos> - No. - I do.
Folks don't care what color your skin is anymore, what your economic standing is.<eos> What people want, what they need is a leader to produce.<eos> I spent eight years in the state legislature, I did a term in city council.<eos> My wife is a well-respected attorney around here.<eos> So I think it's a matter of trust.<eos> - You grew up in a political family. - Yes, sir.<eos> Your father, Rayne Pryce, was mayor during the Seventies.<eos> He created numerous opportunities for the city's black population.<eos> I'd imagine folk down here still love your daddy, don't they?<eos> Yes, they do. Very much.
So, how's my park doing?<eos> Great.<eos> We're up 2.5% over last year.<eos> A bit lower than our initial projection.<eos> No, no, no, how's it doing?<eos> Are the guests having fun?<eos> Are the animals enjoying life?<eos> Well, guest satisfaction is steady in the low 90s.<eos> We don't have a way to measure the animals' emotional experience.<eos> Sure you do.
Can she see us?<eos> They say it can sense thermal radiation.<eos> Like snakes.<eos> I thought there were two of them.<eos> There was a sibling in case this one didn't survive infancy.<eos> Where's the sibling?<eos> She ate it.<eos> So, the paddock is quite safe, then?<eos> We have the best structural engineers in the world.<eos> Yeah, so did Hammond.
Hey, I'm asking.<eos> Are you playing games?<eos> Playing with me?<eos> Hey smarty, are you acting too smart?<eos> Hey smarty, you're getting to fat?<eos> Enough is enough, stop troubling me..<eos> And tell me where's that Singh.<eos> Or you don't know what I can do with you.<eos> Enough is enough, tell me where he is..<eos> Don't do powder of my brain.
- Yes!<eos> You're not a friend... betrayer.<eos> "My heart goes..."<eos> - Pompy.<eos> "My heart goes..."<eos> "My heart goes..."<eos> I also like cream in my coconut water.<eos> Pompy, did you get cramps too?<eos> Idiot, couldn't you warn me.<eos> I did.
Because I can't lose my parents.<eos> I'll miss you.<eos> I really... really love you a lot.<eos> You don't worry, you'll be fine.<eos> I am right here.<eos> I'll go and tell mom...<eos> Sara...<eos> No matter where a girl hails from, but she does feel shy.<eos> So she told you?<eos> Yes, she did.
But...<eos> Adelheid.<eos> - But why?<eos> Heidi!<eos> Stop right there.<eos> I said stop! - Heidi!<eos> Don't go!<eos> How dare you!<eos> Dete said I can leave when I want.<eos> Did she really?
I don't see it.<eos> That is- -A fingerprint.<eos> A big one.<eos> It might be a troll.<eos> A troll?<eos> Uh, yes, I understand your skepticism, Mr. Jones.<eos> Trolls are not indigenous to the Pacific Northwest. But with the return of magic to the world, all sorts of odd things are waking up.<eos> And if indeed it is a troll you're facing, we'll it's not been nice knowing you, per Se--<eos> How do we fight a troll?<eos> You don't.
Yeah, the Mother Goose Treaty of 1918.<eos> Only one way to be sure.<eos> If it is, the inside of this wolf will be stuffed with feathers.<eos> Scalpel.<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe the Obsidian Blade?<eos> That would be...<eos> Oh, well, that might work.<eos> Do you even know what you're doing?<eos> Of course I do.
- You ready?<eos> Let's go.<eos> - We need you to destroy the Vocavitque Rex Daemonia.<eos> - Destroy it?<eos> We came here to get it.<eos> - Those who performed the Black Hymn may try to reverse it before Aeloth's ascension.<eos> - Can't you destroy it?<eos> - No!<eos> Only those who still have a soul can touch the pages.<eos> I do not.
Yeah, my wife and I, we...<eos> We just got married.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Well, have a nice day.<eos> And you.<eos> How is your head?<eos> Fine.<eos> If your wife is coming, let me know and I'll wear a tie.<eos> She'd see right through you.<eos> They always do.
We okay?<eos> We are the same as we've been for a long time.<eos> No different.<eos> Okay.<eos> They asked if we wanted to go sailing.<eos> How wonderful.<eos> And you said?<eos> I said we hate boats and we hate people.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I didn't, but we do.
My first time.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, you're a natural.<eos> Can you hold it for me?<eos> You look beautiful laying there.<eos> Maybe I don't say that enough.<eos> It's difficult, because it makes me wanna be with you.<eos> And I know how hard it is for you to be with me.<eos> Only, don't begin to think he sees you any differently than I do.<eos> Of course he does.
No.<eos> - You're writing something?<eos> - Just drinking.<eos> I see.<eos> They told me who you are.<eos> I've read your books.<eos> - Have you? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> I think I like the first one best.<eos> I guess everybody did.<eos> Everyone did.
I think you're lovely, and I hope your life turns out just as you imagine.<eos> Wanna go for a drive?<eos> I thought we agreed we weren't going anywhere until you wrote.<eos> The rate I'm going...<eos> Let's go for a drive.<eos> I'd like to stop at a church.<eos> Okay.<eos> I prayed that God might forgive me for all the horrible things I said when we knew.<eos> And I prayed for the strength to mean it.<eos> Because I don't.
Is it supposed to be making that noise?<eos> What noise?<eos> You guys hearing some kind of high pitched beat?<eos> Like, eh-ehhhh-eh-eh.<eos> One short, one long, two short. It's Morse code.<eos> It's all for librarians.<eos> Hey, something's wrong.<eos> Come on.<eos> You heard me.<eos> Well, I did.
This was the meaningful act I was searching for.<eos> You can't just take it upon yourself to take someone's life.<eos> Well, I thought it was a very reasonable thing to do.<eos> She hoped he'd get cancer!<eos> But what the hell is hoping?<eos> Hoping is bullshit.<eos> You see, you have to act.<eos> You can't believe it was moral, what you did.<eos> - You don't think that it was moral?<eos> - Of course I do.
Just like a mansion to me, music.<eos> Only it worried me, that playing came easier than praying.<eos> And I... I said this, which may have been an error.<eos> Said it to whom?<eos> My confessor.<eos> He said that was another vent the devil could creep through.<eos> So, he outlawed the piano.<eos> Put paid to music generally.<eos> Said dividends would accrue in terms of growth of the spirit.<eos> Which they did.
I'll decide if and when Vincent needs to know.<eos> You keep him out of this.<eos> How's JT?<eos> Better than he thinks he is.<eos> I'm doing everything I can to help him, but there's a limit.<eos> You know, I'm not good with neurotic.<eos> I don't have the patience.<eos> Still, he almost died.<eos> I know that.<eos> But he didn't.
I mean, men, women, boys, girls, families.<eos> Ironically, no sororities yet.<eos> Um, but then it feeds and moves on.<eos> Moves on to where?<eos> Uh, the next dining location, I take it.<eos> I mean, we've known it's been doing this for at least a century.<eos> Uh, the first confirmed sighting was, uh, 1883, when a woman named Abigail Munson...<eos> I don't need the whole real-estate ad from hell.<eos> Just tell me how to get Katie's friends out of here.<eos> Well, you don't.
We killed a lot of people... some for the money...<eos> But mostly for the fun.<eos> People caught on.<eos> We were runnin' real desperate.<eos> And then...<eos> Like magic...<eos> A fine, little house in the middle of nowhere.<eos> My family never knew how special it was.<eos> Not one of them heard this house whispering.<eos> But I did.
Which'd be not really.<eos> Lydia a friend of yours?<eos> Not really.<eos> I'd be surprised to hear she had one.<eos> We share a mutual detestation.<eos> She disapproves of my disapproval.<eos> What do you disapprove of?<eos> Roman, mainly.<eos> Lydia isn't quite bright enough to see I'm just intimidated.<eos> Roman does, of course.
Look at me.<eos> Look at me!<eos> You'd better kill me now,<eos> Because if you don't, I'm gonna hunt you down, and I'm gonna kill you.<eos> You understand?<eos> Gentlemen..<eos> I hope I never see either one of you ever again.<eos> Wait!<eos> Do you know how she died?<eos> Yes, I do.
And you would have never found her body.<eos> But I did not kill her.<eos> She was like a sister to me.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I need you to leave Bangkok.<eos> You have made thing very difficult for me.<eos> What do you want in exchange?<eos> Do you want to know how Angel died?<eos> - You know how Angel died?<eos> - No, she doesn't.
They had a baby that was born a monster, and it fed upon humans as food?<eos> They say you can still hear its ghost after midnight, wandering around in chains, growling and moaning, looking to feed again upon unsuspecting theater-goers in these very aisles, not having a clue of the horror that could be in store for them.<eos> Please welcome our monster of the evening, and your horror host for tomorrow night,<eos> Danny Gray! Hi, everybody!<eos> Welcome to Ouija Ouikend!<eos> I'm Danny and this is our lovely assistant, Elena.<eos> Okay, so, the scares do not just end tonight.<eos> Tomorrow we'll be having a haunted tour of the Ritz Theater.<eos> Now, you may wonder, hmm, do we have anything else in store?<eos> Yes we do.
Do you think Eric would be open to rehearsing with me in the morning, early?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's Eric.<eos> Speaking of which, where is Eric?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Sorry, it's me.<eos> Oh, my God, you scared me!<eos> Um, sorry.<eos> Ty told me that you guys wanted to know a little bit about tomorrow.<eos> He does.
Hey, um, I'm sorry about earlier.<eos> I really wasn't doing anything.<eos> Well, Elena, just because we're exes...<eos> We're not exes.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I mean, I took you out to a nice restaurant, I bought you decent food, you know.<eos> I was having a great time, I mean, weren't you?<eos> No, I was just being nice.<eos> Elena I think I love you.<eos> Well, I don't.
A trip to St. Tropez there.<eos> And everybody is so happy.<eos> I mean, come on, really? Nah.<eos> And the only one not happy is my poor friend Colette.<eos> Colette's not happy?<eos> What?<eos> Between the divorce and selling the company...<eos> Poor thing, she's having a tough time.<eos> I told her not to sell.<eos> I did.
Children are never alone with the adults.<eos> The children are never alone.<eos> Come.<eos> I wanna show you something.<eos> What...? What'd you wanna show me?<eos> What do you wanna see?<eos> Or maybe you can show me?<eos> Show you what?<eos> What you people have.<eos> What my family on the island doesn't.
Michael and Anne know about this?<eos> Of course not.<eos> They're afraid of anything they can't control.<eos> Maybe they should be a little more afraid of me?<eos> What do I do with this?<eos> Children?<eos> Children.<eos> Gather around.<eos> Who wants to play a game?<eos> -I do.
I'm sorry I saved your ass.<eos> Even with the tiniest nick, the jars have to be recycled.<eos> No good if we can't get an airtight seal.<eos> So everything is grown here locally?<eos> Every last seed and stem.<eos> It seems very healthy.<eos> Michael says the bounty of the earth is ours to master.<eos> You must get tired of the same thing though.<eos> When I was a kid, I loved Red Vines.<eos> I still do.
No, you have to say, "Once upon a time."<eos> Okay.<eos> Once upon a time, six months ago I was in the Congo treating children a little older than you.<eos> There I met this little boy named Arthur and he was a very brave boy.<eos> He used to have a blanket that he would tie around his shoulders like a cape.<eos> I asked him one day, I said, "Why do you tie a blanket around your shoulders?"<eos> And he said, "Because I'm Superman, and Superman can fly.<eos> And he'll never get sick because he can fly away from any disease."<eos> Did Arthur get better?<eos> Yeah, he did.
How many?<eos> At the beginning, there were 500.<eos> We thought he was a god.<eos> Never aging, healing so quickly.<eos> He told us he was the only one, and we never questioned it.<eos> We trusted him.<eos> But when Agnes saw Dr. Jordan's eyes, she knew.<eos> We were such fools.<eos> You had no reason not to believe him.<eos> But now I do.
You're a funny one.<eos> Lucky, Caddie didn't catch you first.<eos> Sometimes he lets the rabbits run just so he can have a good chase.<eos> Says it tenderizes the meat.<eos> Only trouble is, when he catches them he eats the eyes all to himself.<eos> But we'll definitely be sharing yours.<eos> Blue's my favorite color.<eos> Tastes great with honey.<eos> You eat the honey?<eos> Of course we do.
You cheated me!<eos> My God.<eos> You did it, Peter.<eos> You saved the Abbey.<eos> Now you just have to finish the job.<eos> You did this yourself?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You showed me how.<eos> You said it would save Dr. Kyle.<eos> It did.
Murphy, join t' party, huh?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> All you guys having a good time?<eos> You gotta let it go, man.<eos> There's good that came out of this.<eos> Yeah, we used him, then we got him killed.<eos> No, we didn't kill him...<eos> Escobar did.
Sir.<eos> Your friend Gaviria has ordered Special Forces to raid the prison while you're still inside.<eos> I would have done the same thing.<eos> Don't kill him.<eos> If he dies... it will be at the hands of his own government.<eos> Good luck, Vice Minister.<eos> Now what?<eos> I'm sorry, Ambassador.<eos> We have a situation.<eos> Damn right we do.
I brought everything, including the special items requested by Pablo.<eos> - What's going on, buddy?<eos> - Blackie!<eos> - I thought you forgot about us.<eos> - Let me show you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> All right, boys!<eos> Get a ladder over here!<eos> The sicarios weren't the only guys in the prison who worked for Escobar.<eos> The guards did, too.
I also need to raise the war tax.<eos> From now on, a million a month, for both of you... and all our other partners.<eos> Good move beating him, you son of a bitch.<eos> If we get proof that Escobar is violating the terms of his surrender, then they have to send him to a real prison, but we need more than these aerial shots.<eos> Can you get us satellite communications or wire intercepts?<eos> There's a no-fly zone over the prison, with antiaircraft guns manned by the Colombian army to enforce it.<eos> You're playing with fire if Noonan finds out.<eos> We don't got shit on him without intercepts.<eos> - Don't need 'em. - What?<eos> The hell we don't.
It is fact.<eos> Our Packs are a reflection of our leadership.<eos> And your leadership is weak.<eos> You want to make an example of Malcolm?<eos> We need to make an example of you.<eos> An Alpha cannot show his throat like this.<eos> Is not personal, is politics.<eos> There's nothing more personal than politics.<eos> You have one week to deliver us proof of Malcolm's death.<eos> And if I don't?
And if we need to defend ourselves, trust me, we've got that covered.<eos> So, this is what a great werewolf looks like.<eos> Quite the specimen.<eos> I can see why he wants you.<eos> We can work together here, you know, eliminate him.<eos> Train you to work with us?<eos> Oh, I don't think so.<eos> I've seen what he's capable of.<eos> You need me.<eos> Of course we do.
She was creating aberrations under the guise of science.<eos> I never filed a complaint because I didn't want to run the risk of our university losing its funding.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> What sort of aberrations?<eos> Gene-splicing.<eos> Animal mutations.<eos> Stay clear of her.<eos> I don't want to see her taking advantage of another facility.<eos> Dr. Bauer survived.<eos> Yeah, she did.
At the compound, she was... forced to Change.<eos> In front of people.<eos> It's really thrown her.<eos> That's an incredible violation.<eos> But she never has to see those people again.<eos> And they will not remember seeing her.<eos> One will.<eos> One of them was Rachel.<eos> Elena never told me that.<eos> She didn't?
Guys, we're very grateful for your work.<eos> We truly are.<eos> But the research is no longer yours to explore.<eos> Uh, with all due respect, we found the marker gene.<eos> Yes, and with all due respect, we own the patent.<eos> But we started the research at the university. -Serge--<eos> -Exactly.<eos> Started.<eos> You see, after we gave you your grant, in case you didn't read the fine print, you signed over your patent rights.<eos> No, we didn't.
Well, for one thing, he's on Clonestra's board of directors. Mmm.<eos> That's why the wing.<eos> That's why a lot of things.<eos> Hey, kiddo...<eos> I'm sorry I didn't have more faith in you.<eos> Thanks, Mom.<eos> It's weird, you know.<eos> My whole life,<eos> Like even in kindergarten, everyone had all these... crazy dreams to be like the president or a veterinarian and...<eos> I just never did.
Now, that's not gonna happen.<eos> - He's my friend.<eos> - I understand he's your friend.<eos> And I don't know what you guys have been doing, but--<eos> You know, I'm pretty fucking good at my job.<eos> You want me to, I'll find out, but I--<eos> You- - You can't be hanging around with him.<eos> So I can come home, but I can't see my friend?<eos> You know, you wanna be part of the family business... you gotta have responsibility for the family name.<eos> We all do.
If Danny stays, what is he going to do here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We'll have to figure something out.<eos> We are, or you'll just decide?<eos> I'm sorry. What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Well, I just--<eos> You make these decisions and then come to us afterwards.<eos> - It'd be nice if you asked us first.<eos> - Mom wanted him home.<eos> - Dad didn't.
- It wasn't Marco.<eos> - You know what?<eos> - You are so off-base right now.<eos> - Look, I'm not here to judge you. Okay?<eos> I'm just saying you need to be careful because--<eos> What if he finds out about this?<eos> What if he found this?<eos> - How you gonna explain that?<eos> - I don't have to explain anything.<eos> No, you don't.
Kitchen is closed after this, sir.<eos> What's with the bear?<eos> My good-luck charm.<eos> How old are you?<eos> Old enough to know when someone's being an ass.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Immunization boosters.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> No, No. No. Nobody said anything about getting shots.<eos> Uh, yeah they did, during training.
Okay.<eos> Look, you know I have to make the call.<eos> Vega's file says that her next-of-kin is an aunt in Tampa.<eos> Did she ever mention anyone else?<eos> It's her father's sister.<eos> She's the only living relative as far as I know.<eos> Okay. All right, well, I thought I'd just check.<eos> I'll make the call.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yep.<eos> That was Wylie.<eos> They're all set.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, yeah, I'm ready.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Your brothers don't hate you, you know.<eos> Yeah, they do.<eos> No, they don't.
It's just something we have to ask.<eos> Uh, well, if you think of anything or hear anything, please give us a call.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> My name's Ree Osbourne.<eos> I'm here about the two that were shot last night, the two in the forest.<eos> Do you have information about the case?<eos> No, I don't.
No.<eos> I hear it's big.<eos> Huge. Yeah.<eos> How's the tea?<eos> Hot.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I would have mailed you your cup, but I didn't know where you were.<eos> Well, you knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
Sorry, the door was open.<eos> When was this carpet changed?<eos> What?<eos> When was the carpet replaced?<eos> Why do you change a carpet?<eos> Because there is an immovable stain on it, right?<eos> Like red wine or something.<eos> But why do you change the floorboards underneath?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
I witnessed it.<eos> I saw the whole thing.<eos> This is a car crash.<eos> Professor Stoddart Was hacked apart.<eos> If Dan had justification For suspecting frank Sutter did that, Then he had good reason to use<eos> Are you trying to persuade me, governor, Or are you rehearsing for a judge?<eos> Look, if your sheriff Is anywhere near those interviews, All the interview evidence will be deemed inadmissible.<eos> You're a lawyer;<eos> You want to conduct the interviews.<eos> Yes, I do.
Why do you think the sheriff was...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know what's in the sheriff's mind.<eos> Are you afraid to talk about this? No.<eos> Are you frightened to talk to me?<eos> No.<eos> Good. That's good.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> She says she doesn't have a relationship With sheriff Anderssen.<eos> So, she doesn't.
Cause of death-- scissors...<eos> Into the brain.<eos> Stabbed directly through the orbit of the right eye.<eos> Yes.<eos> Your fingerprints were on the scissors,<eos> As were the fingerprints of your lover.<eos> Yes.<eos> But nobody knows which one of you killed Ricardo Scelsi.<eos> Nobody.<eos> You do.
Where the fuck did he get it?<eos> I've changed my mind.<eos> I don't want you here.<eos> You think he killed Stoddart.<eos> You can't accept what he did because you know it's your fault.<eos> It's a receipt for something he shot on the glacier that he wanted prepared.<eos> It's here somewhere.<eos> Did Pettigrew ever talk about why he was here?<eos> He might've done.<eos> Well, did he or didn't he?
Why do you keep those?<eos> They belonged to a sergeant I served with.<eos> Guess they remind me what happens when I fail.<eos> What happens?<eos> He was killed... following me.<eos> He was a good leader...<eos> I don't think you keep those tags to remind you of your failures. I think you keep them because you can't get away from your past.<eos> The squad, the men... they will do the job when the time comes.<eos> Trust them.<eos> I do...
May I see Miss Angelique?<eos> But of course.<eos> Come this way, please.<eos> I trust you shan't be disappointed.<eos> I'm sure not.<eos> Be firm with her.<eos> She is willful.<eos> Like all children.<eos> I hope you know what you bought.<eos> I do.
They'll be here soon.<eos> I felt you walking to my door.<eos> Felt you standing there.<eos> "By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes."<eos> This girl you kissed, Mina.<eos> How you supposed to help her?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But she appeared to me for a reason.<eos> Everything have a reason, does it?<eos> This did.
Lupus Dei.<eos> He shall be your challenge, daughter.<eos> I want to know who did this to you.<eos> Get better, Mr. Roper.<eos> We have much to talk about.<eos> My name is Dorian Gray.<eos> Angelique.<eos> This is where I work.<eos> I hope you know what you've bought.<eos> I do.
Mr. Chandler felt you needed to know.<eos> "For thee are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies... but against mighty powers in this dark realm."<eos> "And against evil spirits in heavenly places."<eos> So these Nightcomers practice a form of black magic, while you practice a form of...<eos> Practicing any form of magic is unbelievable enough, do we need to parse it?<eos> We need to know what these things are.<eos> Yes, they're witches, understood.<eos> Witchcraft has a long history in many cultures, Doctor, as well you know.<eos> As do fairies and sprites, but they don't walk about - Greater London, do they?<eos> - These do.
Aren't you all dying to know?<eos> It's a story.<eos> A narrative that continues.<eos> Language to language.<eos> Greek to Latin to Sumerian to Arabic to 10 other obscure languages and pictographs, changing language from relic to relic.<eos> Is it the story of Lucifer, then?<eos> The angel cast out by God?<eos> Time will tell.<eos> How could this one monk know all these languages?<eos> - He didn't.

Father's murderers.<eos> All those figures screaming in his new crime scenes.<eos> Ah, Mr. Clare... it hurts me to create them.<eos> Like I'm bringing them to life and then torturing them.<eos> Like some sort of terrible African voodoo doll.<eos> They're all fresh when they come out of the molds... and then I make them suffer.<eos> Some people think that's what life is.<eos> Born fresh to suffer.<eos> Do you think that?<eos> Uh... I did.
It's like he's not really alive.<eos> Go on, my dear.<eos> "He took us by our winged backs and raised us over his head.<eos> Thence did he fling us from his heavenly throne and cast us down to Earth into hell, so, we were..."<eos> Damned?<eos> At the very least.<eos> I'm sorry, this is a fascinating narrative but I don't see it's much help to us.<eos> It's the hidden language of the demon.<eos> It must have a purpose.<eos> Not everything does.
Oh, it's fantastic.<eos> I wanted her to succeed here tonight.<eos> I...<eos> Be still your heart, doctor.<eos> This is but one evening.<eos> Mr. Gray is being a proper host to a new guest.<eos> That's all.<eos> You're smarter than that, Miss Ives.<eos> I wanted her to have a life.<eos> Now she does.
For once in my life, I didn't feel like running away.<eos> I felt I had a place to belong.<eos> She was your moors your solitude.<eos> In a way.<eos> Sir Malcolm's just looking for where he belongs now.<eos> Without Mina.<eos> Without you, even.<eos> But when he settles down, he'll come around.<eos> He won't forget about you.<eos> I certainly didn't.
To be free of pain.<eos> To be loved, simply for who you are.<eos> Is that not the engine of all human creatures?<eos> To be normal.<eos> Mother, I don't understand why Charles is so awful to me.<eos> We were drawing pictures and I made fun of her silly horse.<eos> - It wasn't silly.<eos> - Well, it looks like a hippopotamus. - Doesn't it, Clare?<eos> - I'm sure it doesn't.<eos> No, it really does.
All magician's assistants have to be beautiful.<eos> That's tradition.<eos> So... you'll divert the audience while I use my sleight of hand...<eos> And now the fun begins.<eos> I seem to be stuck on something.<eos> Shall we?<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Please.<eos> He really seems taken with us.<eos> He does.
~ The Lower Crosby Festival?<eos> ~ That's the one.<eos> Doesn't the festival start today?<eos> Not for him it doesn't.<eos> ~ No Kate?<eos> ~ On her way.<eos> Took the day off on account of the festival starting.<eos> Some sort of exotic stew?<eos> ~ Do people still eat eels?<eos> ~ Not live ones, they don't.
Check out the local angling clubs.<eos> See if any familiar names crop up.<eos> Anything from the crime scene?<eos> Forensics found a power cable for a laptop in Winning's home study.<eos> ~ And?<eos> ~ And there's no sign of the laptop.<eos> What about his phone records.<eos> He received a call early yesterday morning, made from a phone box.<eos> Do they still exist?<eos> The one on the Crosby Road does.
I have some serious news.<eos> It's bad news.<eos> Your mother is sick.<eos> She has lung cancer and it's very advanced.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> I've got to call her.<eos> She doesn't want you kids to know.<eos> Then why are you telling me?<eos> Because there's hope she could have more time.<eos> People do.
Well, that's not bad.<eos> My mom taught piano.<eos> Yeah?<eos> She still teach?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I wanna show you something.<eos> This is called a Buchla.<eos> It's a mod synth. There's only a couple of them in the world.<eos> Bowie used one of these in Space Oddity.<eos> Yes, he did.
It's good, yo.<eos> I know this nigga.<eos> We got business to discuss.<eos> Without the audience, QDubs.<eos> Y'all good.<eos> Rolla got killed doing some "I don't need niggas with me all the time" shit.<eos> I'm not the one.<eos> Streets don't got no idea who pulled the trigger on him.<eos> Cops don't know shit.<eos> But they never do.
He didn't exactly have a glittering career.<eos> ~ Sir Hugo?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> It came with the house.<eos> It's the anniversary of his death tomorrow.<eos> You obviously know a lot more about the old chap than I do.<eos> The date is on his grave.<eos> Mr Bainbridge says that you're very interested in paganism.<eos> He thinks you have big plans of your own to mark the day.<eos> I did.
It's very sad.<eos> This country never gave any recognition to its mixed-martial arts fighters as sportsmen.<eos> They never got the respect they deserved.<eos> Maybe even the government is afraid of setting the Indian fighters free.<eos> But now the entire world's going to hear about the Right 2 Fight!<eos> That is R2F!<eos> Come on, Gary.<eos> Time to go.<eos> Mr. Briganza, do you think we have world class fighters?<eos> Of course, we do.
- Hey, Daya, come on.<eos> - No. A person only gets married once or twice in her life, so go big or go really big.<eos> Yeah, and it's not just about you.<eos> - It's about all your family and friends. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - I love a wedding party.<eos> - I know.<eos> Me, too. Yeah, what makes you think she wants you there?<eos> Ay, Dios.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Of course she does.
I've heard girls talking about you, saying you can offer help.<eos> I'm in a pretty dark place.<eos> Is this like a guru situation?<eos> I went to see Amma once.<eos> The hugging saint.<eos> We waited for three hours to get hugged, but then Seamus said he felt sick.<eos> He said it was from the sun and the chia pudding, but I'm pretty sure he just got impatient.<eos> I could've used that hug.<eos> I don't know why I didn't stay.<eos> Yes, I do.
I understand.<eos> The only place I feel like I can really talk without getting jumped on is in Berdie's drama class.<eos> That's why I wanted to talk to you.<eos> Is it possible to change counselors?<eos> Well, you... you can't really... switch counselors.<eos> Unfortunately.<eos> You know. But if you're depressed, I can write a recommendation for the administration of appropriate medication.<eos> I don't like putting chemicals in my body that aren't found in nature.<eos> Well, do you want to get better or not?<eos> I do.
- Joey, he's her father.<eos> I'm her father.<eos> I'm the one who stuck around.<eos> He's her real father.<eos> He has a right to have a relationship with her.<eos> You're leaving me for Hank.<eos> He's doing really well for himself.<eos> They made a big chunk of change on that Warner's deal.<eos> - He has ambition.<eos> - And I don't?
Look, this is never gonna work.<eos> The tuna thing is a dead giveaway.<eos> Give me this.<eos> Yeah, it's just all fish.<eos> There's no nuance.<eos> Well, sure.<eos> You should know.<eos> I mean... you do know what a vagina smells like.<eos> Right, sweetie?<eos> Obviously, I do.
You can do this. You can do this.<eos> You're a champion.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Wait.<eos> I think I have something to help.<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> You think so?<eos> I mean, I hoped you'd think so.<eos> I just wasn't sure.<eos> I do.
Who are you?<eos> Michaela, stop.<eos> Are you two screwing?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Michaela, this is holden wescott. We worked together on the mayor's campaign.<eos> What is wrong with you? I don't know.<eos> I just --<eos> Everything at school is really hard.<eos> What does that have to do with me?<eos> It doesn't. I just -
Good.<eos> Look what happened the last time<eos> You told her one of our secrets.<eos> Look, look.<eos> Everything is gonna be fine, okay?<eos> We'll run the dna test.<eos> It'll show that he was the father,<eos> And then hopefully, the laptop will prove<eos> That he was on the roof of the sorority house.<eos> What if it doesn't?
Previously on "How To Get Away With Murder"...<eos> A woman's body was found inside the Kappa Kappa Theta house.<eos> Arrest record on Rebecca Sutter shows a history of drug charges.<eos> What's that?<eos> A Christmas card for Rudy.<eos> Why wouldn't his relatives know he doesn't live here anymore?<eos> Why are you obsessing about Rudy?<eos> You said you didn't know him.<eos> Because I didn't.
What are you doing?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - No, what are you doing here?<eos> - You mean in my house?<eos> - This is my house, too.<eos> Look, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but when Robert told me we were going in on this place together, I made him promise we would never have to be here at the same time.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Because I had Sol actually write that into the contract.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - No, I didn't.
All right.<eos> Female. Hispanic. Burns.<eos> Everything's consistent with the other girl, except that this body's been in the water longer.<eos> So I'm gonna have to take a closer look.<eos> - Talk to you soon.<eos> - All right, guys.<eos> Be well.<eos> That's a second body.<eos> But we don't know if they were on the same boat.<eos> - Sure we do.
You're making it too complicated.<eos> Why not stick to the basics?<eos> Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those chairs and hold your purses.<eos> I know I'd hate that.<eos> Leonard?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> Now then. It's settled.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Sounds kind of perfect.<eos> It does.
I did not jump on her car.<eos> I mean, she owes you money, Trevor.<eos> No, her credit card's expired, and we just haven't got the new one on file yet.<eos> - Deadbeat.<eos> - Collection's not even your problem.<eos> Well, yes, it is my problem if I am getting paid out per session, Trevor.<eos> You'll get paid for every session that you do.<eos> It's my problem, okay?<eos> Trevor, you said you were gonna text me the contact info for the walk-in.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Hey... look, I...<eos> I just want to say that I'm... I don't... I don't need you to give up on training because of any of this.<eos> Hey... you know, I got a bunch of... exercise equipment here that... I'm not gonna use.<eos> - Do you want to take some of it?<eos> - No, that's what I'm saying.<eos> I'm sure this whole experience has soured you on us, but... you know, and just because Power 4 Life wasn't the right fit for you in helping you achieve your goals doesn't mean you should use that as an excuse to, you know,<eos> to give up on those goals.<eos> Hey, you know, I've been watching your videos on YouTube.<eos> Yeah. And you make it seem like you believe all this shit, you know.<eos> Of course, I do.
Because we were under heavy fire!<eos> I don't remember!<eos> 2-5 is on the radio and two men in contact with the enemy.<eos> Jones and Stoffer are fighting to save Lasse's life.<eos> Oscar is in constant contact with the TOC at home.<eos> I do not remember who said what.<eos> But you know who is located in Compound 6?<eos> I react to a report that the enemy is in there.<eos> Did you also know, that there were women and children?<eos> - No, I did not. - Okay...
- That's a long story.<eos> My father was a butcher.<eos> And I have two brothers.<eos> - So we just got the nicknames Butcher.<eos> - Butcher and Butcher.<eos> There was Little Butcher, Medium Butcher, and Big Butcher.<eos> Okay good.<eos> In this court, we have heard the sound from a video clip, in which you pass on orders from the defendant to bomb Compound 6.<eos> At the time, did you know the reason for that order?<eos> Yes, I did.
You are ruining it.<eos> Call me Oli, I am not a spy.<eos> I am here because I think life can be so much better without any nuclear weapons.<eos> Okay.<eos> If they close the food this place is dead.<eos> You want us to have no food on table?<eos> Mum the fish is getting cold, eat.<eos> Well if your country uses nuclear weapons, half of this world would be dead.<eos> So Israel has no right to defend itself?<eos> Of course it does.
Sure, if it's okay with her mother.<eos> Who's Jennifer?<eos> She's on my Double Dutch team.<eos> I thought you were playing basketball.<eos> I wanted to jump rope again.<eos> Tony, you should go see her practice tomorrow.<eos> She's really very good.<eos> I'm out of town this week.<eos> When were you gonna tell me?<eos> I just did.
Well, if my man said that to me, I'd be angry, too.<eos> We don't fight that much anymore.<eos> After 31 years of stalemates, girl, it just is not worth it.<eos> I wouldn't put up with it.<eos> His money became your money the minute he said, "I do."<eos> So I'd give it to my sister anyway.<eos> I don't even like my sister.<eos> Just be careful, Elizabeth.<eos> You do not want World War III to break out in your home.<eos> No. No, I don't.
- I am.<eos> - You're Clyde?<eos> - I'm Clyde.<eos> - You got to be kidding me.<eos> - Hey, Elizabeth!<eos> - Hey, Danielle!<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> I'll let you all catch up.<eos> You never told me that your son was the city manager!<eos> I didn't?
- I'm fine.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> - I'm not who you think I am.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> Right.<eos> - I guess you've changed.<eos> - Yes.<eos> People don't change. When I was 16, I watched my father beaten into a coma by two men who looked just like you.<eos> Do you have any idea what that feels like? To watch your father helpless and bleeding, begging two thugs to spare his only daughter.<eos> They didn't.
- I do know that, too.<eos> - And I'm in with these wonderful people.<eos> And why not say I have a body issue?<eos> I just say... You just say the words, you know?<eos> - What's the issue?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I have an abnormally small dick.<eos> - I have an abnormally small dick! - Okay, uh-huh.<eos> - Sweetheart...<eos> - I do.
- We do.<eos> You don't have to hold this anymore. You know,<eos> I didn't even know it was small until middle school.<eos> Like...<eos> In PE class I would just see guys changing and I would...<eos> Like I knew something was wrong. But I didn't...<eos> Like I asked my parents about it and they were like,<eos> "Well, you'll hit puberty and it will grow."<eos> You know?<eos> But it just... It didn't.
- Honey...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I am very happy for you that you were able to have your little, you know, like, breakthrough over there, but I think we've reached that point in the evening where we should leave before anything crazy happens.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> We can't leave. - Sweetie...<eos> I'm just telling you this because I don't think that you'll firing on all cylinders right now.<eos> I'm not only firing on all cylinders, I am firing on cylinders I didn't even know I had.<eos> Honey, I'm pretty sure that we have moved from, uh, free wheeling, sort of California vibe to more of a swinger vibe.<eos> That's what it feels like to me.<eos> Oh! No, I... I don't...
Well, I don't know, maybe it is the perfect answer.<eos> That tells me, that tells me...<eos> What you just said tells me that the desire is still there.<eos> That tells me that a part of you thinks about what it would be like to be with other women.<eos> Come on! I mean...<eos> Honey...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Not that I think you would act on it.<eos> I mean, I trust you, I do,<eos> I really do.
This is a real thing and I don't think that we can deny it.<eos> I think that you think about other women and I think about other men.<eos> - Alex?<eos> - Do you wanna fuck my wife?<eos> - Stop it, Alex!<eos> - I'm not gonna stop it.<eos> I want to know.<eos> Do you wanna fuck my wife?<eos> Because I'm telling you, she wants to fuck you.<eos> - Oh! - She does.
_<eos> No, I do not need an appointment.<eos> Mr. Hancock knows exactly who I am.<eos> Stand back.<eos> Governor Hutchinson.<eos> I knew your uncle for 30 years.<eos> I first met him when I was quite young.<eos> Yes, you were, sir.<eos> He was a good man, a successful man, one who had the good sense to put you in charge of his quite profitable empire.<eos> That he did.
His family have been a thorn in my side for years.<eos> And now it would seem the sins of the father have been taken up by the son.<eos> Oh, I see, sir.<eos> Um... how am I supposed to help you with this Sam Adams problem?<eos> Well, I need you to take care of him.<eos> You need me to take care of him.<eos> Sir, why don't you just arrest him?<eos> Mr. Hancock, I've been quite kind to your family's enterprises, especially in terms of lax enforcement of certain customs duties.<eos> Wait... with all due respect, sir, we pay handsomely for those privileges.<eos> That, you do.
It is as easy as that.<eos> What was that?<eos> I think that might be my ticket out of jail.<eos> Drink?<eos> He can't stay here.<eos> Abigail, my flame-haired beauty.<eos> A little early for the tavern, isn't it?<eos> Actually, I find that alcohol shortens the day considerably.<eos> You Adams men think you're so charming, don't you?<eos> Indeed, we do.
Good evening, gentlemen.<eos> Mr. Adams.<eos> Mr. Adams,<eos> I am in. Whatever you want, whatever you need...<eos> I am with you.<eos> And why should we trust you? How do we know you're not working for Gage now?<eos> I resent that.<eos> Why the sudden change of heart?<eos> He took my house.<eos> Of course he did.
- You can be useful here.<eos> - Nothing's happening here. We've been at this for weeks.<eos> - No, your cousin, mr. Franklin, me-- We have been at it.<eos> You have been no help at all.<eos> Can you deny it?<eos> Have you done anything to convince these men?<eos> - These men... These men are all terrified.<eos> They're all just in it for themselves.<eos> They all want something.<eos> - Yes, they do, But you do not.
Forgive me, Lady Brienne.<eos> But experience has made me wary of outsiders.<eos> Lady Sansa...<eos> - if we can have a word alone...<eos> - No.<eos> - Please, my Lady, if I can explain...<eos> - I saw you at Joffrey's wedding... bowing to the king.<eos> Neither of us wanted to be there.<eos> - Sometimes we don't have a choice.<eos> - And sometimes we do.
Kneel before me.<eos> Lay your sword at my feet.<eos> Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark,<eos> Lord of Winterfell.<eos> He'll make you a Stark with a stroke of a pen.<eos> It's the first thing I ever remember wanting.<eos> I daydreamed that my father would ask the king.<eos> Just like that I would never be the Bastard of Winterfell again.<eos> No, you deserve that.<eos> You do.
I felt like I was a very lucky woman.<eos> Then he lost his job.<eos> And he started drinking.<eos> And then... beating me.<eos> I could guess how bad the beating would be by the hands of the clock.<eos> Time was a source of terror.<eos> But in here, every moment spent free of that man is a gift.<eos> But... why are you here?<eos> Because I put rat poison in his bibimbap and killed the motherfucker.<eos> She did her husband, too.
It's okay that you didn't wanna be a part of it anymore, Ty.<eos> Beth: You don't have to be a part of it.<eos> See, that's your problem right there.<eos> What's my problem?<eos> You didn't want to be part of it, but being part of it is being now.<eos> That's what it is.<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> Lizzie: You don't have to.<eos> Not if you don't want to.<eos> You don't.
Sit him up.<eos> You're being cautious.<eos> I completely understand.<eos> How many of your people are out there?<eos> You have a flare gun.<eos> You have it to signal your people.<eos> How many of them are there?<eos> - Does it matter?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, it does.
Alive.<eos> But the fight...<eos> It turns on you.<eos> You've got to let it go.<eos> That's what Bob was trying to tell me back at the church.<eos> What to risk.<eos> When it's safe.<eos> When to let someone in.<eos> The rules keep changing.<eos> They did for me.
That's what you worry about? !<eos> I'm trying to figure out what it is.<eos> What it is exactly.<eos> This... it isn't real.<eos> Sasha, you've been through a lot and I accept that, but what you just said... that's bullshit.<eos> Take your pick.<eos> Look, I've been thinking.<eos> Do we really need these?<eos> I mean, things go bad, yeah, sure. We do what we gotta do, but it's like you said. We don't need these for that.<eos> Right now we don't.
Well, it was just an owl.<eos> Grand scheme of things, I think we'll live.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Heard you lost your wife.<eos> You know... I'm sure it looks like we haven't lost much, but we have.<eos> We've lost things.<eos> Other things we're just fighting like hell to hold on to.<eos> Everything you people have been through, I don't know if you see that.<eos> We do.
Everything you people have been through, I don't know if you see that.<eos> We do.<eos> Bring your kids in for a checkup.<eos> I know I offered you one, but they really should come in.<eos> They were out there a while, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks, Pete.<eos> Let's be friends, man.<eos> We kind of have to be, right?<eos> Yeah, we do.
Could have told a story.<eos> What, you think I should have?<eos> They don't know what they're doing. - Any of them.<eos> - We'll show them.<eos> I don't know if they can see it. How things really are.<eos> I don't know if they can yet.<eos> - They haven't caught up.<eos> - We have to be here.<eos> - We have to.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
No, we exile him if it comes to that.<eos> We do that, we don't know when he comes back and what he does to them.<eos> Letting him go makes this place vulnerable.<eos> You really want to wait till someone in that tower has to take care of it?<eos> - And that's if we're lucky.<eos> - We are not... executing anyone.<eos> Don't ever suggest it again.<eos> That sort of thinking doesn't belong in here.<eos> People die now, Deanna.<eos> They do.
Deanna:<eos> Stop it! Stop it right now.<eos> You touch them again and I'll kill you.<eos> Damn it, Rick!<eos> I said stop.<eos> Or what?<eos> You gonna kick me out?<eos> Put that gun down, Rick.<eos> You still don't get it.<eos> None of you do!
Whatever your interpretation, it was still assault.<eos> This gentleman is willing to not press charges if you help us out.<eos> Get your client to tell us where he has the family stashed.<eos> Guys, I'm the definition of a broken record on this.<eos> Nacho is not your man, comprendo?<eos> Nobody took the Kettlemans.<eos> The Kettlemans took themselves.<eos> You gonna keep playing that line, it's gonna go rough.<eos> You know what?<eos> Do your worst.
I knew it. I knew it.<eos> Finally, someone believes me.<eos> - Why do you believe me?<eos> - I heard the details.<eos> - Your story makes sense.<eos> - Of course it does.<eos> Devil's advocate, like the cop said, the Kettlemans' cars are still at their house.<eos> No record of them leaving.<eos> How'd they get out of the country?<eos> They didn't.
You lost your virginity?<eos> Does it count if it's rape?<eos> You did the raping, right?<eos> Well, he was drunk, but his thing wasn't.<eos> How do you rape a dude?<eos> He was sort of paralyzed by Frank's beer or something.<eos> I thought he would like it.<eos> I thought all guys did!<eos> - We-- we do.<eos> - Well, Matty didn't.
No, I said I wanted Hamburger Helper!<eos> Where the fuck did you get grilled cheese?<eos> Just forget it, Dad.<eos> I'm gonna go to Sbarro.<eos> Mountain Dew, large.<eos> - Diet?<eos> - Did I say diet?<eos> Sorry. Most girls order diet.<eos> - Okay. That comes to $9.30.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
But, hey, I'm back in town.<eos> - Graduated, finally.<eos> - You look so different.<eos> - Really?<eos> - But that's still there, so now I see it.<eos> Yeah, well, anyway, I'm helping Coach P with Maggie here.<eos> Coach was saying that she's trying to get a hold of you.<eos> I don't know if...<eos> - Did you just say you graduated?<eos> - I did.
You hear about that ungrateful little bitch?<eos> If you're referring to Maggie, yeah.<eos> I heard she won't be coming back.<eos> She didn't even say it to my face.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I didn't see that coming.<eos> Yeah, I don't think we did.<eos> Fuck her, right?<eos> Who needs her?<eos> The gym did.
- Oh, shit! - And I think her bag's gone.<eos> I've got a bad feeling about this.<eos> Well, what do you want us to do about it?<eos> Um, meet me at S's, yeah?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Bye. - Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Helena's missing.<eos> No, no. You and I, we have other priorities.<eos> No, we don't!
Don't you go selling me.<eos> Don't you go selling me short.<eos> I've had a little pile stuffed in my mattress.<eos> Made some real smart investments.<eos> I'll have you out of here in no time.<eos> Another early payment.<eos> Just some judicious scrimping and saving, that's all.<eos> You'll have no problems from me.<eos> You run a good, clean establishment.<eos> Much better than Collier ever did.
Sheldon, this has to stop.<eos> You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.<eos> Amy, I've gotten more done in the last few days than since I made the switch to dark matter.<eos> What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?<eos> Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.<eos> Perhaps, but I'm not taking the cap off.<eos> It's one thing to make yourself miserable but you're making everyone around you miserable too.<eos> Now I'm telling you for the last time, take the cap off.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> What if I don't?
Why?<eos> Why did it feel different?<eos> "Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, "or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man "with porcelain skin and curious clothing<eos> "A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings."<eos> You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends.<eos> I'm starting to miss that.<eos> He still hasn't responded.<eos> What's taking him so long?<eos> Do you really want him to write back?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?<eos> - Please don't.<eos> Yep, you're mad.<eos> Okay, let me see the damage.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I think you broke the dowels.<eos> You won't have time to glue it.<eos> You'll have to nail it. - With what?<eos> - Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?<eos> - She does.
Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and...<eos> Fort Cozy McBlanket.<eos> I'd say... Knox over Ticonderoga 'cause it's got the gold.<eos> And McBlanket over Sumter 'cause it has a higher thread count.<eos> Oh. 10:00.<eos> Date night's over.<eos> Wait, no.<eos> We haven't picked a winner.<eos> We both know this one's gonna win.<eos> Well, of course we do.
We haven't had a good invisible man in a while.<eos> Clearly you've never seen me try to talk to a woman.<eos> Guys, in the time you've been sitting here playing video games I got the car washed, picked up supplies and went to the bank.<eos> I put on pants.<eos> Kiss ass.<eos> Okay, I don't know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today.<eos> You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.<eos> Hey, I don't even live here.<eos> Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry now?<eos> I do.
And there was something in his voice.<eos> It was how he was talking.<eos> It makes me think it was you.<eos> Stace, I don't think it was.<eos> I can't recall any late-night heart-to-hearts with him.<eos> Not around then.<eos> Maybe it was a CI, or a case.<eos> Listen I know what you're doing.<eos> You don't think I haven't had those thoughts?<eos> I do.
Lawyer.<eos> You're not under arrest.<eos> Did anybody here say "arrest"?<eos> Cop to cop.<eos> Lawyer.<eos> Fine.<eos> What lawyer?<eos> Ehrmantraut, who's got him and where?<eos> That way.<eos> Hey, fellas, how you doing?
You've been here before.<eos> On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and...<eos> - Where are you taking me?<eos> - Home.<eos> The Boltons have Winterfell.<eos> The marriage proposal... It wasn't for you?<eos> No.<eos> Roose Bolton murdered my brother.<eos> He betrayed my family!<eos> He did.
You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates.<eos> You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father.<eos> Stop being a bystander, you hear me?<eos> Stop running.<eos> There's no justice in the world.<eos> Not unless we make it.<eos> You loved your family.<eos> Avenge them.<eos> How do we get through there?<eos> We don't.
We must not let her sniff out any trouble.<eos> You can't leave me here.<eos> I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me.<eos> But it won't be for long.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black.<eos> He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way.<eos> But first, he has to take Winterfell.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
Why Daenerys?<eos> Why is she worth all this?<eos> As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion.<eos> Do you believe in anything?<eos> I believe in lots of things.<eos> In something greater than ourselves, I mean.<eos> The gods, destiny.<eos> Do you believe there's a plan for this world?<eos> No.<eos> Neither did I.
I know.<eos> Why should the people trust a queen who can't keep her promises?<eos> Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man.<eos> I can't remember ever seeing a sane man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you.<eos> He claims he would kill for you and die for you and nothing I ever witnessed gives me reason to doubt him.<eos> And yet he did betray you.<eos> Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayal?<eos> Yes.<eos> Many opportunities.<eos> And did he?
We're prepared to give you that new life.<eos> If?<eos> If you swear you'll join us when the real war begins.<eos> Where is Mance?<eos> - He died.<eos> - How?<eos> I put an arrow through his heart.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.<eos> Hey, none of you saw Mance die.<eos> I did.
and says, "Ignore that.<eos> It was a long time ago"?<eos> I got nothing to show her.<eos> Who cares about her?<eos> You should see what she does.<eos> It's so sensual.<eos> Get your camera.<eos> Why?<eos> I want you to take my picture.<eos> No, you don't.
No, I like it here.<eos> It's peaceful.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> You know, my dad, he actually built the cabin.<eos> Cut the logs for it and everything.<eos> That's impressive.<eos> I think your dad and my dad would have gotten along really well.<eos> Yeah, probably.<eos> He has his own way of doing things, John, you know?<eos> Yeah, he certainly does.
She's run away before.<eos> Did you file a missing persons?<eos> We can't.<eos> I know the last time we saw each other it wasn't...<eos> No, no, it's okay.<eos> I'll be right over.<eos> These are the most recent pictures of Emma.<eos> This her boyfriend, one of these guys here?<eos> Right here, but I've never heard her use that word.<eos> None of them do anymore.
And all of you are gonna watch.<eos> So, piggy bank, you getting mad yet?<eos> You getting mad?<eos> Do your thing.<eos> Do your thing.<eos> Oh, really.<eos> That's a little hard, Mr. Policeman.<eos> Mr. Tough guy, huh?<eos> I don't want to play that.<eos> How you doing?
Or what, you write me up and pencil bone me, you paper clip?<eos> Hey, you wanted to work with me, okay?<eos> This is me.<eos> So I've got to go out and find a pay phone?<eos> Do you got one in the car?<eos> Send the old guy out to find a pay phone.<eos> Is that it?<eos> I just bought you five minutes.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> - No, you don't.
I had to go to my kid's open house last night.<eos> Get some suction in here, please.<eos> No, no, it was, like, hours of us sitting on those little stools, you know?<eos> Hector.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Let me tell you where we are.<eos> We've got a witness who can put a car on the scene of a homicide, and we've got somebody who can put you in that car.<eos> We've got credit card and I.D. belonging to the vic in your possession.<eos> - I didn't kill nobody.<eos> - Who did?
No, no, it was, like, hours of us sitting on those little stools, you know?<eos> Hector.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Let me tell you where we are.<eos> We've got a witness who can put a car on the scene of a homicide, and we've got somebody who can put you in that car.<eos> We've got credit card and I.D. belonging to the vic in your possession.<eos> - I didn't kill nobody.<eos> - Who did?<eos> Why they got to shoot me?<eos> Who did?
Year of trying before Matt would even, um, you know, even respond to me, and then, you know,<eos> I don't know how long before he'd even...<eos> You know, he'd really talk to me.<eos> Having... having some kind of a relationship with them, that's what saved me.<eos> And I mean that how I say it.<eos> It saved me.<eos> So, um... you know, if there's anything that you can tell me about Matt...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Whatever.<eos> It doesn't...
Whatever.<eos> It doesn't...<eos> It doesn't matter now.<eos> Was Matt on drugs?<eos> D-did... did he... Did he deal drugs?<eos> - What? - Did... I mean, 'cause...<eos> No, but they're saying things about Matt.<eos> They're saying things about him, and I need to know.<eos> He had some grass around.<eos> Everybody does.
My Mercedes is in the shop.<eos> Yeah, I ought to give him a raise.<eos> You're right.<eos> Jim, I saw you on the TV.<eos> That billboard thing?<eos> And I had me a pair of insights.<eos> Insight the first: You ain't afraid to put yourself out there.<eos> And insight the second: You believe in the real America.<eos> Freedom. Self-sufficiency.<eos> I do. I...
Yeah, I ought to give him a raise.<eos> You're right.<eos> Jim, I saw you on the TV.<eos> That billboard thing?<eos> And I had me a pair of insights.<eos> Insight the first: You ain't afraid to put yourself out there.<eos> And insight the second: You believe in the real America.<eos> Freedom. Self-sufficiency.<eos> I do. I...<eos> I really do.
No, no, no, no, this is standard procedure.<eos> They do this on every crime show.<eos> You know, the murder police come down to the scene of the crime and they find some blue-collar guy and they talk to him while he's working.<eos> Let's just talk to this guy over here-- he could know something, right?<eos> Why would he know anything?<eos> He's moving crates from one place to... (clicks tongue) Will you just listen to me?<eos> Excuse me, sir, uh, do you work here?<eos> Yes.<eos> Please, don't stop your work.<eos> They never do on TV.
No, no.<eos> Please.<eos> We're trying to show Bill that life is worth living.<eos> Your dad loves you.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Has he not said it?<eos> Because I'm telling you, he just...<eos> He does.
Stay where you are.<eos> You guys are a little over-dressed for campus security, don't you think?<eos> Don't I at least get to make a phone call?<eos> To whom?<eos> Everyone you know is either dead or hates you.<eos> I could call a lawyer.<eos> Lawyers aren't really my thing.<eos> Tell me about your father.<eos> Why did he kill himself?<eos> He didn't.
- What?<eos> - What was it?<eos> - Got a Woodrow Wilson High School.<eos> - That's it.<eos> Tom?<eos> Tom?<eos> - That's it.<eos> Woodrow Wilson High School. That's where he's hiding.<eos> All due respect, Professor, how you know that?<eos> I just do.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Best of luck.<eos> I'm sure they, uh... they deal with this sort of thing all the time.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> Okay.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, fine.<eos> I thought the ER creeps you out.<eos> Still does.
Have fun.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Morning.<eos> How long have you been up?<eos> Since yesterday about this time.<eos> All night?<eos> Well, it's just the manager is counting on me to have this down.<eos> You're ironing your jeans?<eos> People iron their jeans.<eos> No, they don't.
In a former life, I was VP at Alpha Managers.<eos> No doubt you're familiar with our Texas branch.<eos> I think we were number three in the area.<eos> I'm Jim Adams.<eos> Jacob Masterson.<eos> Call me Big Jake.<eos> All right, well, tax codes can be a bit tricky around here, Big Jake.<eos> See, once a business hits a 250K threshold, municipality and state taxes can run up to 15%.<eos> - I didn't know that.<eos> - Yeah, not a lot of people do.
You'd take a big tax hit.<eos> Yeah, we don't have a choice.<eos> Trying to get our daughter to college.<eos> You mind if I...<eos> Oh, yeah, please do.<eos> Tell your husband to max out his contribution.<eos> They'll match him dollar for dollar. Wait.<eos> They'll do that?<eos> Nobody ever mentioned that.<eos> They never do.
Hi!<eos> I like your place!<eos> You haven't actually been inside before.<eos> Nope!<eos> Well, if you come to the kitchen, here's where your surprise is.<eos> OK!<eos> This reminded me of the one you were wearing the other night, so I had to buy it for you.<eos> I can't accept that.<eos> You don't like your present.<eos> I do!
He chose you.<eos> From where?<eos> He was one of my professors.<eos> Simon said he knew... that we were meant to be together from the first moment that we met.<eos> How long have you been here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A few years.<eos> Years?<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> No, we don't.
That kind of thing.<eos> Bad enough that I slept on the couch.<eos> And you were still fighting this morning?<eos> I left without speaking with her.<eos> But it's not like Jess to just run away like that.<eos> What about the time in Puerto Vallarta?<eos> - That was different. - How?<eos> It was before we were engaged, and I screwed up.<eos> Did you screw up again, Evan?<eos> No, I didn't.
John is already so hammered.<eos> He had way too much champagne.<eos> No, no.<eos> Thanks again.<eos> I thought a Batman-themed Bar Mitzvah was tacky, but this really can't compare.<eos> It was his idea.<eos> Well, we were gonna have it at the strip club, but that food is terrible.<eos> Yeah, well, congratulations to you.<eos> I hope you'll both be very happy and have a good lawyer.<eos> But we do.
- Is Mom with you?<eos> - No, she's coming up later.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Look, I know it's no secret that your mom and I have been having problems.<eos> I just want you to know that no matter what happens with us, you will always be my daughter.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's a miracle that you survived us.<eos> You must be some superhuman kid.<eos> You know how much your mom and I love you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Am I correct in assuming we're now square?<eos> Square.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Who is it, Craig?<eos> Oh, it's Mr. McGill.<eos> Good morning. Come on in.<eos> Oh, I love what you've done with the place.<eos> Last time I was here, it was well, not a contender for the cover of Good Housekeeping, that's for sure.<eos> - Do you have news about our case?<eos> - I do, in fact.
You're skipping from thread to thread,<eos> Each one another possible path history could have taken.<eos> What's with all the magic?<eos> We learned how to use it in order to hunt it.<eos> When my brain tumor grew, I used magic to save my life,<eos> But it altered my brain permanently.<eos> This is horrible.<eos> History will continue to unravel until All of time is undone.<eos> How do we fix this?<eos> We don't.
Where is he now?<eos> He just climbed into the helicopter.<eos> He knows you're here.<eos> Do you have a plan for getting in?<eos> I'm going with a nine-millimeter tucked under my arm.<eos> Buffie doesn't trust you.<eos> He believes you know what happened to Steiner.<eos> I've been trying to call my son since yesterday, but he doesn't respond.<eos> Do you know where Steiner is?<eos> I do.
Riley.<eos> It's me.<eos> Will...<eos> Are you real?<eos> Left. Go left.<eos> I'm not gonna be able to carry her out of here.<eos> - We have to wake her up.<eos> - How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
- I don't understand, sir.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Guys, come on.<eos> It seems he's not coming back.<eos> Van Damme always comes back.<eos> Daniella, I don't think you both were listening to me.<eos> What I'm saying is that he came to the set.<eos> - He came to the fucking set.<eos> - The director says he knows him.<eos> Yes, he did.
Had the nicks ground off the blade, and polished off the rust with a bit of whale oil.<eos> You needn't have troubled yerself.<eos> It was no trouble.<eos> - Looks better than new.<eos> - Aye.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> So, my stomach's rumbling like thunder.<eos> Jenny, how about you put some supper on the fire?<eos> You know yer way to the dining room, lads.<eos> I do indeed.
Didn't hear you come in.<eos> Yeah, it was late, and I didn't want to wake you.<eos> What did Cornell want this time?<eos> Just...<eos> More questions, and...<eos> I didn't tell you that I went down to the station earlier 'cause I didn't want you to worry.<eos> Little late for that.<eos> Why does she keep wanting to talk to you?<eos> I mean, she can't seriously think...<eos> She does.
! Are you following me?<eos> ! Scott is dangerous!<eos> You are so wrong!<eos> He's a really good guy.<eos> Nat, are you...<eos> What's going on?<eos> His own wife said he's violent and unstable.<eos> You... you... you have to stay away from him. I don't have to do anything you say.<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - No, I don't!
- That's bullshit. - Ah, so what?<eos> I'm finished.<eos> With this, all of it.<eos> So, what about Li-Na? Huh?<eos> - Well, intel has her in Paris. - Oh, come on, boss.<eos> - Do you believe that?<eos> - Michael... It's called the chain of command.<eos> You obey the person above you without question.<eos> - You believe that?<eos> - No, I don't.
You'll have to shoot me in the back.<eos> Don't worry, you're only following orders.<eos> Arret!<eos> Arret!<eos> What do you want to do, Mikey?<eos> To tell you the truth, I'd rather not get into it with them.<eos> We hand her over, it's game over.<eos> Take her in ourselves and they'll roll out the red carpet.<eos> Since when has that ever mattered to you?<eos> It doesn't.
Well, it's cold out there.<eos> The Agency is the best bet for survival.<eos> Besides, I was fucking good at my job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You were.<eos> Don't you fucking move.<eos> You just still see the bad we did.<eos> I see the good.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I don't know how long it lasted.<eos> Something went down.<eos> If you say so.<eos> I didn't hear anything about it.<eos> Could've been the President was called away.<eos> That happens all the time.<eos> Not this time.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Clearly, I have a source that knows more than you.<eos> Hmm. Most sources do.
It was legal, it was necessary, and it was right.<eos> Heather Dunbar?<eos> She's never run for office.<eos> You don't become Solicitor General without being politically savvy.<eos> It takes more than savvy to be elected president.<eos> Don't forget, she has a national profile after the Walker investigation.<eos> Truth and justice personified.<eos> If the leadership wants to redefine the party, she's--<eos> No one with this little experience has ever been a real contender since Ross Perot, and at least he had the money.<eos> So does she.
I keep those relationships private so no one will suspect any bias toward me.<eos> But Robert and I are very close.<eos> He and Ruth have me over for dinner once a month.<eos> So you already knew about the Alzheimer's?<eos> He told me the day he was diagnosed.<eos> I've never had anything but his best interests at heart.<eos> You don't care about Robert.<eos> You wanted to sideline me.<eos> So you actually think you have a shot at this office?<eos> Yes, I do.
Could we do it alone?<eos> Could two men alone build the Brooklyn Bridge?<eos> Maybe. But it would take forever.<eos> Just how long do you think the residents of Sandpiper Crossing have?<eos> Referring this case to HHM is for the good of the clients.<eos> That argument you won today against the restraining order the judge was never gonna grant that.<eos> Schweikart is throwing softballs. And he's gonna keep on throwing them over and over.<eos> We'll be busy swatting them away we'll never spend time on the actual case.<eos> This case will span years. And we don't have the capital to carry it forward by ourselves.<eos> We simply don't.
Henry, your father...<eos> My father is dead.<eos> So is his dream.<eos> Mr. Habershorn, if you're interested, I'd be willing to sell you back your land at the full price to do with what you wish.<eos> I've received a letter of interest from the Mount Sinai people.<eos> I suppose I'll have no choice but to sell to them.<eos> That's sure to lose me some friends on the Upper East Side.<eos> But what's to become of this place?<eos> I don't want to tell you your business, Henry, but I feel I owe it to your father to provide my wise counsel at this time.<eos> No, you don't.
See, me and her, a ways back, we worked together.<eos> That's when I started having feelings for her.<eos> And I know she was having feelings for me, too.<eos> But there was no way that I could, uh... make her my own seeing as how she was... married to the Church and all.<eos> Then I figured a way out.<eos> I set her up.<eos> You set her up?<eos> Told a copper I knew what she was up to and he set a trap for her.<eos> I knew the Church wouldn't look too kindly on it.<eos> And you didn't.
there's someone's in the house.<eos> Huh? What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Caleb!<eos> Caleb!<eos> My baby!<eos> Where's my baby? !<eos> It's early, Ryan.<eos> My wife thinks I'm sneaking out of bed to have an affair.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Ms. Ryan?<eos> Last time I heard your voice was in a courtroom.<eos> Brody Nelson.<eos> I'm Special Agent Avery Ryan.<eos> Let me introduce you to the team.<eos> Elijah Mundo.<eos> Daniel Krumitz.<eos> Raven Ramirez.<eos> I wish we had time to chat.<eos> We don't.
- Thank you.<eos> - After you.<eos> So... we start over.<eos> As though we meet for the first time.<eos> Please.<eos> - Promise him a prison.<eos> - A prison?<eos> A brand new federal corrections facility.<eos> Why would his constituents want convicts in their backyard?<eos> They don't.
The pain that just consumes you?<eos> Oh. For a while, yeah.<eos> Still, on bad days.<eos> What was she like?<eos> Sorry, you don't have to...<eos> No, I don't mind.<eos> She was...<eos> She'd had a tough life.<eos> She had a lot of baggage.<eos> Which I did, too.
I could have answered your question when we first met.<eos> I was told it had to be here at the Temple.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Only the breath from the mouth of Gaia can guide the Oracle.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> You came all the way from the Forest of Troezen to ask your question, but when you saw that I'd run away, you went after me, risked your life, killed a man, and a cyclops, then dragged me back here, all because the priests said<eos> I had to stand over the mouth of Gaia?<eos> What, is that not true?<eos> Well, the mouth helps, but you could have let me try!<eos> I did.
don't embarrass yourself, Gravely.<eos> The hours of folly are measured by the clock, but of wisdom... No clock can measure.<eos> - Okay, what the hell is he talking about?<eos> - I never know.<eos> This is the watch stolen in yesterday's fire.<eos> Okay, I'm assuming that because that is in an evidence bag that you got it legally.<eos> No, it does not.<eos> I had to steal it so as not to blow Valentine's cover as a paid police informant.<eos> Speaking of blowing and of Valentine, did he happen to mention anything about me owing him 200 bucks?<eos> He did not.
Idealistic.<eos> I feel like buying girl scout cookies from her.<eos> She's got a theory on the crime?<eos> Yeah, and I agree with her.<eos> We all think you're half right.<eos> Your childhood enemies are thieves.<eos> And arsonists.<eos> No, just thieves.<eos> And Gravely wants to catch this firebug before it kills someone.<eos> We all do.
Draper!<eos> Oh, Melanie.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I must have overslept.<eos> They're coming before work.<eos> I told your service, but you never called me back.<eos> There's no time for a shower.<eos> I'll make the bed.<eos> Thought you were having the carpets cleaned.<eos> I did.
- Get out.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I tried your little saying and I'm off the business.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I made your joke and it failed miserably.<eos> - The soap thing?<eos> - No!<eos> The one where I told them they were assholes.<eos> You could have thought of something yourself, you know.<eos> I did.
I don't mind playing house, but as long as your mother and Kevin are away, why don't you call in sick?<eos> Let me take you to Bermuda.<eos> No.<eos> Cape Cod?<eos> I don't want to go anywhere I don't want to go.<eos> Don't make plans for me.<eos> All right.<eos> I have a lot of work.<eos> Look, I know I told you not to complain, but that doesn't mean I don't want to hear about it.<eos> But you really don't.
Well then it's on.<eos> We make a vow that this time next year, - Hell or high water, - 10, 9. - we'll be married.<eos> - 8. - Or engaged.<eos> - 7, 6, 5.<eos> - Or else.<eos> - 4. 3, 2, 1.<eos> Happy New Year!<eos> 365 DAYS REMAINING<eos> So here's the plan.<eos> We do internet dating, blind date 1 minute dating.
And you still think you have a winning hand?<eos> I was once a man of status.<eos> A respected figure.<eos> Now I am hounded out of my own country.<eos> Believe me, I have no hand to play.<eos> Then why gamble with your daughter's life?<eos> - Because I had no choice!<eos> - More games.<eos> I had no choice because I do not have the cipher.<eos> Samara does.
I'm so..<eos> I'm so sorry, I'm, I, I, I didn't mean, I... It's okay, baby.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay, I'll make something else. Sh, sh, sh. It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I wish Dad were here.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, I miss him too.<eos> You miss him?<eos> I do.
I'm so sorry, I'm, I, I, I didn't mean, I... It's okay, baby.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay, I'll make something else. Sh, sh, sh. It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I wish Dad were here.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, I miss him too.<eos> You miss him?<eos> I do.<eos> I do, so, so much.
Mortal danger.<eos> But there's nothing anyone from the medical community can do about it.<eos> There's no help she can be offered for what oppressing her now.<eos> You will have to forgive my inability to make unnecessary leaps of faith, when there is a clearly more rational answer sitting right in front of me.<eos> I will not turn a blind eye to the fact that Bethany is a clear danger to herself and to others, just to give credence to some half-baked notion that this family's problems are anything beyond explainable science.<eos> It's gone quiet now down there.<eos> That isn't my daughter anymore, is it?<eos> Of course it is, Mrs. Mills, please understand.<eos> I know my girl.<eos> A mother always does.
Why do you question what you don't know?<eos> Do you wish to know a pig that sits silently while atrocities are being committed here?<eos> I'll change the subject, then.<eos> What do you want with Bethany?<eos> To make her suffer.<eos> To make every breath an indignant agony.<eos> But why?<eos> Because we can.<eos> Because she let us in here.<eos> No, no no, I didn't.
Da Vinci...<eos> "Fetch me this."<eos> "Build me that."<eos> Well, I built a bloody submarine.<eos> A ship that moves... underwater.<eos> Underwater, you prick.<eos> I followed him across the ocean to the New World.<eos> Nearly died helping him.<eos> Think he says "thank you"?<eos> Does he, fuck.
You've got t minus 20 minutes.<eos> So you're American.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> How can you not be sure?<eos> Well, my mother was American.<eos> My parents met in New York City.<eos> And I just moved around a lot when I was young.<eos> Then my father decided I should come back here and go to school.<eos> I wish I was born somewhere else.<eos> Yeah, everyone does.
Where are you guys staying tonight?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> We were actually meant to be home a few hours ago.<eos> When?<eos> About, like, five hours or so.<eos> You should stay the night with us.<eos> We're actually married men.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> To me, it does. It does!<eos> To me, it does.
You didn't feel even a tinge of jealousy?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Have you told Oliver?<eos> You haven't, have you?<eos> How could you do that to the man you love?<eos> He was an absolute mess.<eos> His father was in jail.<eos> I wanted to tell him.<eos> I really wanted to tell him, but I had to wait for a better time.<eos> But you never did, did you?
But Nurse Elkins has everything under control.<eos> Perhaps I could lend a hand.<eos> I cared for a great number of women in my practice. Of course, none as lovely as these.<eos> We're really just organizing it now.<eos> Uh, who's first?<eos> How about you?<eos> Forgive me, my hands are cold, but my heart is yours, hmm?<eos> Hop up on the table, dear.<eos> I think we have everything under control. And they need their privacy.<eos> Don't we all.
Please don't be mad, Hermie.<eos> You know how special you are to me.<eos> And to the judge and to that fat fellow before him and to the Spaniard before him.<eos> Yes, I have been waiting that long.<eos> Ever since you obtained a new boss, it seems harder than ever to see you.<eos> Did he take out an advertisement in "The Morning Telegraph"? Hmm?<eos> Is there a billboard of you on Broadway?<eos> Are you jealous?<eos> I just thought you would always want me at the head of the line.<eos> I do.
What was all that talk just then?<eos> Mutual respect is all.<eos> Is this why you brought me out here?<eos> To show me a good time hoping I'd give you something back for all that you've done?<eos> Is that why you've done it all in the first place?<eos> - Was that your game?<eos> - Hey, this isn't a game.<eos> I got feelings for you, Harry.<eos> As much as just said so as did you about me.<eos> I certainly didn't.
No, no, it's a risk, I know, but I'll be with you the whole time and I'll be ready to inject you if the fever starts to take you.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Abby.<eos> Abby, this is a chance to cure you.<eos> You know, it would give you your life back.<eos> But can you be sure it won't take my life instead?<eos> No. I can't.<eos> My father... tended to Secretary of State Seward on the night Lincoln was shot.<eos> Did you know he was attacked, too?<eos> I didn't.
- No.<eos> And the father?<eos> Whaler she met at a saloon.<eos> He's somewhere in the Atlantic for all she knows.<eos> They can't just throw her in the street.<eos> I should try and get her in on the ward at the Knick.<eos> They'll certainly be eager to hear from you.<eos> I thought I had baby troubles just last month.<eos> I told you girls don't let the fella finish inside you.<eos> I didn't.
Of course. I'm sorry.<eos> After the swelling goes down, try to... keep it elevated and then you can go home.<eos> Excuse me one moment.<eos> Lucy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sure that must have been a surprise.<eos> A pleasant one.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I know I felt more than you at one point, but I won't pretend my treatment towards you after our falling out wasn't intended to hurt you.<eos> It did.
She's the dumb one.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Well, let's get started.<eos> If you'd like to come with me, please.<eos> Whoa, whoa. Where are you taking them?<eos> The X-ray room.<eos> I want to see what bones and organs they might share.<eos> If you want them to take their clothes off, that'll cost more if that's what you want them for.<eos> No, that is not what I want them for.<eos> Many men do.
If your colleagues threw your coat in the toilet - would you also just regret that it happened?<eos> - They are adults in a workplace.<eos> - This is my daughter's workplace.<eos> That they are children does not excuse this behavior.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> So what are you going to do?<eos> I will talk to the teachers and remind the students about our zero tolerance...<eos> Why should you talk to all of the students?<eos> - We don't know who it was.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
If you had that kind of money, I wouldn't be here.<eos> This is unfair.<eos> I have to get out.<eos> I got a business.<eos> - There are people I take care of. - I'm sorry.<eos> I can't stay here.<eos> You understand?<eos> Do your fucking job.<eos> I got things to do.<eos> Don't we all?
Who's that?<eos> That's my daughter.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Madeline.<eos> Maddie.<eos> She's pretty.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - She gets that from her mother, obviously.<eos> Didn't tell me you guys had a suspect.<eos> We don't.
I'll take it under advisement, Lieutenant.<eos> I'm his partner.<eos> What is this regarding?<eos> Do you have information about the case?<eos> Hold on. Harry.<eos> Guy say she's Nicholas Trent's lawyer. He refuses to talk to anyone but you.<eos> This is Detective Bosch.<eos> How can I help you? Do you have Nicholas Trent?<eos> Sir, we do not have your client in custody.<eos> No, sir, we do not.
That's funny. Okay, food and drinks over there, and suits in the cabana if you want to swim.<eos> But suits are completely optional.<eos> I'm the one who kissed a girl.<eos> You know, star of the viral video.<eos> Look, she's kissing a girl right?<eos> We'll be outside.<eos> She's got a bottle of Tequila and something to prove.<eos> I predict live girl-on-girl action by 10:00 P.M.<eos> I can't believe she just showed up.<eos> She didn't.
Two.<eos> Three.<eos> That was like a group mugging.<eos> - (Prince inhales) - People in New York are fucking nuts.<eos> Oh, fuck this.<eos> I need a real smoke.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hello.<eos> I think I hurt this guy and he's gonna come here looking for me.<eos> He already did.
And what was the real reason?<eos> He wouldn't tell me. Well, what did he tell you?<eos> Enough for me to know it would be unethical if somebody didn't look into this.<eos> But you can't, so you want me to get Harvey to.<eos> Well, you convinced him to look into my case when he didn't want to, didn't you?<eos> This is different.<eos> We don't take cases like this. Maybe, but I believe a man who can convince Harvey to hire someone who never went to law school could convince him to make an exception for this.<eos> What?<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> Well, I do.
These flight cases make a perfectly good dining table.<eos> Spot the bachelor.<eos> Yeah, well, at least now we have a proper control center.<eos> I'm sick and tired of working hunched up over a coffee table.<eos> Hey, you not eating those?<eos> No.<eos> So it was around dinner time that they took off, right?<eos> Yeah. Left all their stuff.<eos> Didn't even pack anything for the baby.<eos> Well, of course they didn't.
- Why would he be in Colorado?<eos> - Free weed. Not free, idiot.<eos> Legalized.<eos> Shouldn't somebody call the police?<eos> No!<eos> Weeds are free in Colorado?<eos> Uh-huh. That's right, sweetie.<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
What do you make of it?<eos> It's the temple on Mount Pelion.<eos> Its wings are said to touch the sky.<eos> The next full moon is in four days, and he wants to meet at sunset.<eos> Tell me she isn't useful.<eos> How do we know it's not a trap?<eos> For heaven's sake, of course it's a trap.<eos> The question to ask is whether we can turn Lykos's trap to our advantage.<eos> How do we know the message is even from Prince Lykos?<eos> We don't.
So you take on debt?<eos> Listen, if I get the property, I can expand, you know?<eos> L'll- - I'll pay it back.<eos> Well, you better. Or they're gonna own the place.<eos> I know how it works, Meg.<eos> Okay?<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, did you think about that other thing?<eos> Cutting Danny back in?<eos> Did you?
This... this was detached.<eos> This was a killing from afar by a sniper on a lonely highway.<eos> The victim was either chosen randomly or specifically hunted.<eos> Or you could be wrong about the whole thing, Mr. Know-it-all.<eos> [Sighs] If it's not a hate crime, then the lieutenant can't stall the civilian oversight anymore.<eos> Um, if it wasn't a hate crime, lieutenant, what would it be?<eos> A robbery.<eos> There's a key broken off in the glove box.<eos> Where did you find the car keys?<eos> We didn't.
Pink dresses.<eos> Yeah, that is interesting.<eos> W-what's interesting?<eos> Well, it appears that Jenna had appropriated your wife's personal style.<eos> She didn't appropriate you, too, did he... she... he?<eos> You didn't kill Jason for inappropriately appropriating your husband, did you?<eos> - What?<eos> ! - Are you insane?<eos> I would never do that, and I liked Jason.<eos> No, you didn't.
No.<eos> She slept with him.<eos> So she was a lesbian.<eos> Her husband didn't know anything about it, and she'd like to keep it that way.<eos> She only told me because I'm a minister.<eos> You did that on purpose.<eos> Did she admit to giving him the silver soda pop?<eos> Okay, who is "she" now?<eos> The lawyer.<eos> And, no, she didn't.

Where are you?<eos> I'm on the roof.<eos> They jammed the cell phone signals in the building.<eos> Listen, I'm innocent.<eos> John...<eos> You gotta believe me.<eos> I've heard that you shot and killed five cops in cold blood.<eos> You know me.<eos> You really believe that?<eos> No, I don't.
Did he come here?<eos> I just want to help him.<eos> I'm not here as a cop right now.<eos> Well, maybe Walt doesn't know that.<eos> That's what he said?<eos> I didn't talk to him.<eos> Dave, I can get your phone records.<eos> I can see who called here and for how long. I thought you said you weren't a cop, right...<eos> Did he say where he was going?<eos> - Mr. Hodiak, I don't...
Minx, I'm Claire.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You do?<eos> You're the lady who makes mommy cry.<eos> This is our home.<eos> You brought that woman into my house.<eos> Minx might be our only chance of finding out where Sean is.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He did.
It's the house I saw in my vision. No.<eos> Look, this is ridiculous.<eos> We have to go.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> - Good afternoon, ma'am.<eos> - You'd better not be from the bank.<eos> - I told y'all that...<eos> - No, we're from a charity devoted to helping wounded veterans. I...<eos> You know, I'm-I'm sorry, ma'am, I think my friend has the wrong house.<eos> - No, we don't.
What do you have in mind?<eos> Send out a legion of peace to Jaggar.<eos> These are Philistines, sir.<eos> They are barbaric in every sense of the word.<eos> Regardless, send them anyway.<eos> - And you go with them.<eos> - What?<eos> I see them approaching.<eos> They've got a white flag.<eos> So they do.
- Is that true?<eos> Thank you, Van Damme!<eos> Let's go inside.<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> - Come, come, come!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You'll never have outside privilege if you continue teaching me.<eos> I rarely get to go out.<eos> But today looks beautiful.<eos> It does.
I love dolls.<eos> My father could never forgive me for that.<eos> When I was eight years old, my father made me join a swim club.<eos> He'd been on the same club and... he said that the things that he learned in that locker room were the things that made him the man that he is today.<eos> I hated that locker room.<eos> At that age, I was really uncomfortable with my body.<eos> I didn't like to be naked, especially in front of other boys.<eos> But you had to take a shower before you could go in the pool, so I would do it, but I would wear my suit and a tee shirt.<eos> And the boys would tease me, but I would try to hurry and... ignore them, and it... it worked for a while.<eos> And then one day it didn't.
Sorry.<eos> Stiles says he can't find anything on the author.<eos> He thinks it's a pen name.<eos> "In a small New England town, teenagers are taken in the night and buried alive.<eos> "Days later they emerge transformed, wreaking havoc and spreading terror,<eos> "commanded by an ancient order of parascientists known only as<eos> "the Dread Doctors."<eos> Sounds vaguely familiar.<eos> How does it end?<eos> It doesn't.
Zack.<eos> There.<eos> You talk.<eos> It has begun.<eos> Come.<eos> This place is a maze.<eos> Where is it?<eos> It's, uh, here.<eos> You don't remember which unit?<eos> Of course I do.
This way of viewing the world is dangerous, and it will lead to failure and death.<eos> Did you see that coming?<eos> ! Hmm?<eos> Okay, where are you getting your information from?<eos> I'm one of the super psychics of China.<eos> That sounds very important.<eos> [Knock on door] That guy will fill you in.<eos> L-lieutenant, the Chinese government runs a psychic training program to hone the skills of gifted young children, and I believe that he is one of those gifted children.<eos> I'm... I'm surprised your government let you out.<eos> They didn't.
Already did.<eos> And it says...<eos> "You will be betrayed by your partner."<eos> - That's right.<eos> - And you found it where?<eos> Buried under a stack of ious made out to Dominic Chan.<eos> If it was up to me, you'd be out of that uniform tomorrow.<eos> Still have to write the exam.<eos> I never would have taken you as someone that believed in psychics.<eos> I don't.
Then I wouldn't give to Beckford, no.<eos> - I ain't sure about that guy.<eos> - Mr. Rayburn.<eos> - Take care of that.<eos> - Hey, Debbie from the bank.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - How you been?<eos> My sister got all the paperwork over, right?<eos> Everything's okay?<eos> - Yes, she did.
Hey, where's Mom?<eos> She's out back. Hey!<eos> I thought we had an understanding.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I watch your back.<eos> You watch my back.<eos> Are you mad at me for some reason?<eos> How about you lied to me?<eos> About the will.<eos> - No, I didn't. No, I didn't.
Mom, Aunt Libby. This is my friend, Tina.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> I shouldn't have to chase you into town to meet your friends, Henry.<eos> They're welcome at the house.<eos> Well, in fact, we are just shopping for dinner now.<eos> Tina, would you like to join us?<eos> That's so nice of you, but I really can't.<eos> My little one's waiting for me at home, and he gets anxious if I'm gone too long.<eos> Of course he does.
I-i need help!<eos> I need... I need help!<eos> Get a doctor!<eos> I need help.<eos> I need help. He's breathing.<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> I need help.<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> - Do something! - Sir!
I don't want to get into that.<eos> No, of course. Of... of course.<eos> Well, how... how you doing?<eos> You look good.<eos> - You're... army still good for you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I like Germany.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Um, I get to see a bit of Europe on my time off. - Yeah.<eos> - You doing all right?
Okay, this isn't helping anything.<eos> How do you know they weren't Gwen's drugs?<eos> How do you know she didn't get high before she started passing herself around?<eos> If we're gonna have the conversation,<eos> - we're gonna have the conversation. - Hey, that's enough, Barb.<eos> - Let's have it.<eos> - Let's have it.<eos> Let's have that conversation, Barb, because the things Gwen's told me...<eos> - Oh, the things she's said.<eos> - What? What did she...
Why shouldn't I blow your fucking head off, right now?<eos> Because you're not a murderer, James.<eos> A killer, maybe.<eos> But not a murderer.<eos> What?<eos> Bad things happen.<eos> But you're forgiven.<eos> That's all the plant is trying to tell you.<eos> It wants to help you, James.<eos> It does.
It's nice talking to you, officer.<eos> Forest ranger...<eos> Maybe next time, man.<eos> No worries, bro.<eos> All is forgiven.<eos> All is forgiven.<eos> Get the fuck out of here, man.<eos> Little souvenir for you.<eos> The kid got his head right, after all.<eos> That he did.

Really?<eos> Well, whoever it is, I'm guessing they don't get invited to the block party.<eos> - We're on the East Side, Nick.<eos> (PEOPLE CHANTING SLOGANS)<eos> PEOPLE".<eos> No justice, no peace.<eos> The best thing is, he has to rely on the districts that never vote.<eos> He had everything to the east where no one ever misses an election there.<eos> - 'Cause they give a shit, right?<eos> - This year they do, for sure, Hank.
You know, thatjudge, he lives in Westchester.<eos> And Sussman and them lawyers, they live where they do.<eos> You know, I'm guessing you got yourself a nice little place in Manhattan somewhere, or Park Slope? Am I right?<eos> But, you see, we live here.<eos> And when I pick up a copy of The New York Times and I read what you are writing about me, and about this kid mayor who's gone all wet, and about the housing thing, I know that it's got nothing to do with what's going on here.<eos> And what's going on?<eos> People working for their homes, for their neighborhoods.<eos> They want to keep what they have.<eos> And you really think that building a couple hundred units of public housing is gonna wreck those neighborhoods? (SCOFFING)<eos> Yeah, I do.
Let go.<eos> It's done.<eos> Do something new. Cut it.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Nay, just-- take the day off with me.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> You know Vinni is looking for any excuse to fire me, and you know that.<eos> I need you to snap out of it.<eos> - Do it for me, please? - Okay.
Well, word got around pretty quick that, uh, Daniel had confessed to raping and, uh, and killing Hanna.<eos> Did that surprise you?<eos> Honestly, I just felt relief.<eos> You weren't even surprised by the confession of the rape?<eos> Later, i-i thought about it, and I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just forget.<eos> Can we circle back?<eos> When trey came by your house that morning... Did you know that Hanna was dead?<eos> I did not.
S-so, where are you gonna stay?<eos> Oh, at Dad's.<eos> At your dad's?<eos> Janet and Daniel took a trip down the coast, uh, near Savannah.<eos> Good for them.<eos> But he's not coming back, Tawney...<eos> To Paulie.<eos> That's probably best.<eos> I wonder if he ever finished his kitchen project.<eos> He didn't.
- Turn it back on.<eos> - Why? It's hopeless, Vera.<eos> Schiller broke his seal, and it's only a matter of time before the rest of the Horsemen do it, too.<eos> What if he's right?<eos> It's starting to seem like this Apocalypse thing is a done deal.<eos> Because it is.<eos> Take it from the guy who can see the future.<eos> The future isn't always certain, and you know that. Look, guys,<eos> - we have to fight.<eos> - We did.
Probationary.<eos> You want to call her?<eos> She said it's urgent.<eos> I said get out of here.<eos> I got a plan.<eos> Your daddy's got Hakeem performing at Laviticus on Saturday.<eos> I'm gonna get you up on the stage, too.<eos> He don't want me there.<eos> I don't care what he wants.<eos> Well, we do.
Well he did.<eos> It was this big.<eos> I don't really know what I'm gonna get.<eos> I'm probably just gonna get a beer.<eos> Yeah, so many choices.<eos> I think me too.<eos> So your profile says you're into gardening.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it's just something I used to do with my mom.<eos> I should probably know what these are, but I have no clue.<eos> I definitely don't.
Dorothy cuda. Wow.<eos> You look great.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -How are you?<eos> -Really good. -Good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good. I'm good.<eos> I'm gay now. In case my mom didn't tell everybody.<eos> She did.
I saw on the news... It could have been a neighbor that killed Tom?<eos> Well...<eos> The press know even less than the police do.<eos> They just make things up as they go along...<eos> Hurting innocent people, ruining lives.<eos> Did you know Tom was yours?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, I have no business asking that question.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I didn't...
I didn't...<eos> Until after.<eos> It must have been devastating.<eos> You probably have some idea.<eos> I mean, after Malcolm was taken from you.<eos> Vanessa told me.<eos> Malcolm wasn't taken, Ben.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wish I could tell you that the pain of losing a child goes away...<eos> But it doesn't.
And who will suffer?<eos> My kids, my reputation.<eos> Guilty whether you did it or not.<eos> Yeah, well, that's why I'm going to court... fight the good fight.<eos> Look, you should go to the press, set the record straight.<eos> The press don't want the truth.<eos> They want a good story.<eos> Then give them yours.<eos> No one knows you're innocent until you tell them.<eos> The police do.
- Yeah.<eos> Man, I know I've been acting crazy. Yeah.<eos> But I still can't remember that night.<eos> Cornell's all over me.<eos> Maybe I'm just paranoid.<eos> No, man, she definitely has wood for you, but...<eos> I got your back, okay?<eos> Remember that.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You'd think a rich girl like her would've had that birthmark fixed.<eos> I don't know.<eos> If it was a birthmark, her parents would have had it fixed.<eos> That's a scar.<eos> I don't think she wanted it fixed.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Oh, it's a badge of defiance.<eos> Against everything she's supposed to be.<eos> She tell you that herself?<eos> Yeah, she did.
I'm all choked up.<eos> Have I answered all your questions, Detective?<eos> You haven't answered any of my questions.<eos> You took a young, naive, rich girl with daddy issues. Stop.<eos> And got inside her head... Stop.<eos> Now I'm getting choked up.<eos> Other than the money, what do you care?<eos> You didn't know her.<eos> Nah.<eos> But you did.
Tennessee Three Finger Hold 'Em.<eos> Your father took it very seriously.<eos> He asked you how to play.<eos> You said, "We each get five cards."<eos> You dealt them out, then you pointed to the far end of the yard and you said, now... "Whoever gets to the tree first, wins."<eos> You dropped your cards and were halfway there before anyone else realized what was happening.<eos> I've never seen your father more proud.<eos> See, here's the thing.<eos> I was terrified for you, I didn't know why.<eos> And now I do.
You know, there is no religious directive on file, so okay if I recycle him?<eos> Factory on 39 needs some fertilizer.<eos> Not yet.<eos> I'd like to know what the hell Holden is discussing with the Captain right now.<eos> For all we know, he could be working out a deal.<eos> Yeah, for himself.<eos> The only thing I see here is an incoming ship.<eos> One you can't even identify.<eos> How do you know they're coming for Naomi?<eos> We don't.
Powers Division is a circus.<eos> - Everyone knows that.<eos> - I don't think you're really in a...<eos> Cops never ever catch the really big, really bad Powers.<eos> You didn't catch Pulp or Black Mondo.<eos> Without help from other Powers, you're fucked.<eos> Wow. You're kind of a...<eos> I caught Wolfe.<eos> You didn't catch Wolfe.<eos> That old Power did.
She's a bird of prey and that's her perch.<eos> - That is badass.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How did you find out you had powers?<eos> In high school, back in Seattle, we used to sneak out onto the docks, climb the cargo cranes, you know, drink beer. Do dares.<eos> Who can go out the farthest on the gantry.<eos> I was out there pretty far one night, and the wind gusted and I slipped.<eos> I fell.<eos> I was falling, and all I wanted was to miss the ground, but I was gonna hit it no matter what.<eos> And then, I didn't.
Close your eyes.<eos> Wade into the quiet of the stream.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Thirsty.<eos> There's someone here very anxious to see you.<eos> They told me he knew exactly how to cut me.<eos> They said it was surgical.<eos> He wanted us to live.<eos> He left us to die.<eos> But we didn't.
Head, hands, arms, and legs.<eos> A topiary.<eos> This is my design.<eos> A valentine written on a broken man.<eos> Will...<eos> I do feel closer to Hannibal here.<eos> God only knows where I'd be without him.<eos> He left us his... his broken heart.<eos> How did he know we were here?<eos> He didn't.
It is.<eos> I say that without ego.<eos> I don't require conventional reinforcement.<eos> You would agree, Signora Fell?<eos> My husband's ego is not measured by conventional means.<eos> I first prepared this dish in honour of my sister when I was very young.<eos> I'm sure you've perfected the recipe over the years.<eos> The meat...<eos> - You have a very good butcher.<eos> - I do indeed.
- He should be back by now.<eos> - They'll be ok.<eos> They better be.<eos> Your whole plan rests on Bellamy getting in.<eos> He will.<eos> Counselor Kane and Clarke Griffin, please report to the south airlock immediately.<eos> We'll finish this later.<eos> Did he say something?<eos> No...<eos> But his blood did.
Roger that.<eos> You sent for me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Octavia has nothing to fear from me.<eos> I do trust you, Clarke.<eos> I know how hard that is for you.<eos> You think our ways are harsh, but that's how we survive.<eos> Maybe life should be about more than just surviving.<eos> Don't we deserve better than that?<eos> Maybe we do.
I can't do that.<eos> It would mean the end of our people, Clarke.<eos> Clarke, we need him.<eos> And I need his son to believe me.<eos> Don't make me do this.<eos> Dad...<eos> I'll take care of our people.<eos> None of us has a choice here, Clarke.<eos> I didn't want this.<eos> Neither did I.
Look at that, though.<eos> That's beautiful.<eos> Mom.<eos> - Hey, honey.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Bridal magazines?<eos> - What?<eos> You can't wait five minutes before you start planning this thing?<eos> Someone left this in Bungalow 4, and I'm just looking at it.<eos> They did not.
- Okay. - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> That was a stop sign.<eos> Y-yeah, it was.<eos> You just went right through it.<eos> Uh, y-yes, I did.<eos> Well, could you do me a flavor and stop at the next one?<eos> Carol, stop signs are there to mediate traffic.<eos> And traffic doesn't exist anymore, so essentially stop signs don't either.<eos> Yeah, except that they do.
- Sorry. - Okay.<eos> Uh, here, I'll just put it back the way you had it.<eos> That'd be great.<eos> Whoa, whoa, wait!<eos> Now, no, no, no!<eos> Be gentle!<eos> Carol, Carol! Watch out for my Jenga tower, okay?<eos> I spent a lot of time on that.<eos> Oh, and you think that's time well spent, Phil?<eos> Yes, I do.
-Claire--<eos> -No, Castiel, I'm done.<eos> I have to be on my own.<eos> Ain't life a bitch?<eos> Nebbishy little guy, me... always sticking it to the lunkhead jocks.<eos> You know what?<eos> Screw the Mark, let's just kill him.<eos> Boy, he really is a mess.<eos> Who knew the Mark was so toxic?<eos> Well, actually, I did.
So, you open, I'll sum up.<eos> And we should cash that check, have Karen see what she can find out about Confederated Global.<eos> Right.<eos> Where the hell is she?<eos> It's a fairly simple form.<eos> Here you agree, in writing, to never again disclose information regarding your former employer, the dissolved entity known as Union Allied Construction, or any of its affiliates.<eos> Upon execution of this agreement, the corporate interests, as they currently exist, agree not to pursue legal action against you.<eos> Against me?<eos> Well, you signed a non-disclosure agreement the day you were hired, Miss Page.<eos> Everybody did.
And we had a saying-- fubar.<eos> Yeah, we had that, too.<eos> So when you put a dead judge, the Gerhardt family, and some hitters from Kansas in a bag together, I go back to thinking it might be best just to confess to the crime myself-- go live a long life in a cell somewhere with hot and cold running water.<eos> He got a place in town, then-- your uncle?<eos> Rye.<eos> Something he doesn't tell people, where he can do his business?<eos> - You mean nail girls?<eos> - Girls, drugs.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't.
Tell me everything about this new group you're working with.<eos> What new group?<eos> You know.<eos> Your drinking buddies from the bar.<eos> I want to know their names, how you met, your mission.<eos> Their mission?<eos> No, they got nothing to do with El Jefe.<eos> Oh, so you don't want to see your brother again.<eos> No, no, I...<eos> I do.
Ah, look at me.<eos> My first international summit, and I am a nervous wreck.<eos> Have we done the right thing coming here?<eos> Wanting a better life for your people is always the right thing.<eos> You know what I'm up against, Helen.<eos> The only reason I'm here is to promote peace, while the warlords back home are ready to start civil war.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> Breathe, Abdul.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> We all do.
Lena?<eos> Come here a minute.<eos> I know it's awfully difficult at the beginning.<eos> Everyone struggles at first, but it's just a test.<eos> And you're doing very well, I must say.<eos> Honestly.<eos> Thank you, Aunt Gisela.<eos> I like you, Lena, and the others like you, too.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Hope will suffer far more than Freya.<eos> Hope's magic will be tainted with your vampire blood as well as the aggressive wolf temperament.<eos> Without the proper tutelage that only I can provide, hope's power will grow unchecked.<eos> She will lash out at everyone, including you.<eos> She'll devastate the city that you love, and then her terror will spread far beyond.<eos> I, too, am a firstborn, so I was the only one to help save Freya from herself, just as I'm the only one who can save your daughter.<eos> You've seen it, Klaus. You need me.<eos> Miss him already?<eos> Niklaus didn't kill Aiden.<eos> So... who the hell did it, then?
If the answer's yes, then you got to live with that.<eos> We're out of time.<eos> I've located Hayley, and I strongly advise, do not attempt to stand in my way.<eos> Niklaus' paintings contain Mikael's ashes in the soil.<eos> Go to the compound.<eos> You cannot stop me from getting that baby. You begin this spell.<eos> Prepare the battlefield.<eos> I'll bring hope to you.<eos> Your daughter will need my guidance...<eos> Just as Freya did.
What do we know?<eos> Apparently the federal marshal guarding Werner Zytle just started shooting while Zytle waltzed off in the panic.<eos> This is my favorite part.<eos> That's pretty convenient.<eos> Guy decides to wig out, and Zytle takes advantage.<eos> It's not convenient, it's planned.<eos> Those are the affects of his vertigo.<eos> Zytle was in a full set of restraints.<eos> How did he even manage to dose a federal agent?<eos> He didn't.
It's my job.<eos> It is my job to keep the people of this city safe.<eos> And that includes you, too, Speedy.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm always going to hate Malcolm Merlyn.<eos> But right now, he is a necessary evil.<eos> We can take care of ourselves--<eos> Not against Ra's al Ghul.<eos> You have to trust me on this.<eos> I do.
You're more than a friend, Anton.<eos> You're like a brother.<eos> Always had my back, always loyal.<eos> Stand up.<eos> So when they told me someone ignored my orders to lay low when they told me one of my crew shot a cop I beat the man who said it was you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Danny, that cop it was a mistake.<eos> What we're planning here requires two things.<eos> No mistakes and the cops not knowing anything.<eos> They still don't.
You let him get away?<eos> I saved your lives.<eos> Felicity, it wasn't your call to make.<eos> It wasn't my call to let Oliver go challenge Ra's al Ghul to a fight to the death either.<eos> Brick has who knows how much evidence, Felicity.<eos> And it was either that or the two of you, my friends being killed, so I made my choice.<eos> I chose not to let anyone else I care about die.<eos> We've been in tough spots. We've always managed to come out.<eos> No.<eos> Oliver did.
We not going to. I'm coming with you.<eos> Assuming that this works someone's going to need to bring Thea back home.<eos> We need a way to get to Nanda Parbat.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Something awful has happened. And I need a favor. A really big favor.<eos> Last time you asked for a big favor, I had to loan you my helicopter.<eos> I don't need your helicopter.<eos> I need your jet.<eos> Well, Oliver does. But both of us.
But you did see her again.<eos> And you'll see her again again. This is different.<eos> Just been thinking about the person I was the brother that I was and how he probably died when that boat went down.<eos> All this time, I've been struggling with who I am.<eos> You think who you're supposed to be is the next Ra's al Ghul?<eos> Honestly?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The only thing I can know for sure is that everything that I've done everything that happened it led me right here to this moment.<eos> And, Felicity, if that's true then I don't know what it was all for.<eos> I do.
I don't understand.<eos> Malcolm is gonna take you home.<eos> Aren't you coming with?<eos> Not now.<eos> You go on, I'll catch up.<eos> I love you, Thea.<eos> Don't ever forget that, okay?<eos> Oliver...<eos> Oliver, I don't know what to say.<eos> I do.
- Sounds good.<eos> - Actually, it doesn't.<eos> You were completely unhinged out there tonight, Dig.<eos> - You're in denial about how angry you are.<eos> - No, Felicity, I'm not in denial.<eos> But I am angry.<eos> Oliver.<eos> He was my best friend and he kidnapped my wife.<eos> You think that justifies hospitalizing people?<eos> No, Felicity. It doesn't.
I am not hungry. Yes.<eos> Many a bride has skipped a meal or two before their wedding day.<eos> I would rather die than wed this pretender.<eos> You speak as though they are the only two options before you, my daughter.<eos> Daughter?<eos> And to think I once wore that title with pride.<eos> Perhaps "mother" will suit you better.<eos> After your betrothal to Al Sah-him you will extend my lineage by having a child.<eos> - If you think I will bear his child...<eos> - Yes! I do.
!<eos> We're just going to negotiate with him now?<eos> Are we just going to give in? Turn over an innocent person?<eos> She's not innocent!<eos> She's the daughter of the Demon.<eos> She's killed hundreds of people.<eos> Enough!<eos> The only thing that matters is getting Lyla back.<eos> I don't care how we do it.<eos> Yes, you do.
I'd say you have the right to remain silent, but I'm not a cop.<eos> It's over.<eos> That's it.<eos> Nice and easy.<eos> The man you think I am, he'd kill you here and now.<eos> I told you to back off, and you didn't listen!<eos> So kill me, go ahead.<eos> Show Felicity the kind of man you really are.<eos> I have nothing to prove to her.<eos> But you do.
I haven't left the house since Daddy died.<eos> Whenever I had a problem, I could always ask Connie.<eos> Hmm...<eos> He always knew how to handle any situation.<eos> How would he handle this one?<eos> Oh!<eos> Ow!<eos> Ow!<eos> If you meant what you said in there, then you have to trust me.<eos> I do.

Larissa Moscovitz was murdered.<eos> She's dead?<eos> - What do you know about that?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> It's not... It's not what it looks like.<eos> I-I-it looks like something?<eos> What does it look like?<eos> Dmitri.<eos> It looks like I paid to have sex with her.<eos> It does?
- Okay.<eos> Or rejected by the rest of your family.<eos> Believe me.<eos> Your issues are real.<eos> Ms. Hale-Cooper can help you.<eos> I never heard such a load of crap in all my life.<eos> Yeah, I couldn't hear anything.<eos> There was static on the microphone.<eos> I just wish that Fleck had offered up a list of Larissa's clients.<eos> - Well, he didn't.
Detective John Almond and Officer Frank Moto here to see Mr. Keane.<eos> Oh. Hello again, Ms. McGrail.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Small world.<eos> Yeah, it's really small.<eos> Some people say follow the money.<eos> I say follow the roses.<eos> When asked about his knowledge of the crime Dmitri green replied that it wasn't what it looked like.<eos> McGrail then replied, "it looks like something?"<eos> Well, it did.
Number one, it's countdown to washout for the new guy.<eos> And two, the fail-safes on the ride never engaged because the coaster's computer never detected an emergency.<eos> You mean in time to stop the accident?<eos> I mean at all.<eos> According to this diagnostic, the coaster never crashed.<eos> What?<eos> There's no record of anything going wrong. Coaster ran every required pre-ride check.<eos> Proper functionality across the board.<eos> Yeah, it's like it never happened.<eos> But it did.
Sam will find her.<eos> And bring her home, that's our strategy.<eos> Maybe he shouldn't.<eos> What?<eos> We already found her.<eos> What good did it do?<eos> Ken, she's 16.<eos> Drag her back home, watch her day and night, she'll... find another window to climb out of.<eos> What does Manson want with you?<eos> He doesn't...

Dude gets loose.<eos> All he's got to do is roll on out of here.<eos> Can't even keep himself clean that long.<eos> Brothers, man, they always bitch...<eos> How a brother can't get a break.<eos> They let his ass go, cuts a dude, O.D.s his girl.<eos> I didn't do nothing, but I'm the one still stuck in here.<eos> Prosecutors want to talk to you.<eos> Hell, yeah, they want to talk to me.<eos> Now they do.
Asian.<eos> Well, could be worse.<eos> One more person I have to justify myself to.<eos> You don't have to justify anything.<eos> I used to see... grieving mothers on TV going after whoever they thought was responsible.<eos> I would think, "I get it. You're upset, but don't be crazy.<eos> Don't act crazy."<eos> There's nothing crazy about believing no one cares as much about my son and what happened to him as I do.<eos> The police don't.<eos> The lawyers don't.
I'll hide you.<eos> Walk behind me.<eos> Hey, what are you doing later?<eos> Working.<eos> Want to go for a drive?<eos> Where?<eos> ( singsongy ) It's a surprise.<eos> ( singsongy ) I don't like surprises.<eos> Everybody likes surprises.<eos> No, everyone does not.
Um, excuse me, how much are we talking about here?<eos> Stay out of this, Eddie, please.<eos> Jackie's 5,000 in arrears with another 10 due tomorrow to keep me on retainer.<eos> Attorney-client privilege?<eos> If I don't get that money by tomorrow, you'll need a new attorney for your nursing license hearing.<eos> Maybe your boyfriend here can help.<eos> Wow, I... hey.<eos> Everything I have is yours, you know this.<eos> I know, but you don't have a job, Eddie.<eos> Yeah, well, you barely do either.
What has he done?<eos> Can you hear me, Signor Pazzi?<eos> Take a deep breath while you can.<eos> Clear your head.<eos> I haven't had a bite all day.<eos> Actually, your liver and kidneys would be suitable for dinner right away.<eos> Tonight, even.<eos> But the rest of the meat should hang at least a week in the current cool conditions.<eos> I didn't see the forecast.<eos> Did you?
Excuse me.<eos> Terminal cancer.<eos> Wow. Talk about overdoing it with the alibi.<eos> Dr. Deb: Lieutenant backstrom.<eos> Hey. Gravely, this is my doctor, deb.<eos> Back in his home country of tandooristan, He is the sultan of surgery, But here he just works for the police union.<eos> I'm here visiting a patient who needed surgery, Just like I'll visit you when you're here For your quadruple bypass.<eos> Okay. You've missed three appointments.<eos> Do you have a good reason?<eos> Yes, I do.
She did.<eos> Brittany helped.<eos> So what? This is her dream board, not yours.<eos> The subconscious never lies.<eos> Is nursie on paquet's list Of those who had access to the credit card?<eos> Yes.<eos> She did it. She rented the car.<eos> Check her computer.<eos> Do I have your permission to search this computer?<eos> No, you do not.
I was a victim of cyber crime.<eos> Like you, I posted on social media, checked my bank account balance online, even kept the confidential files of my psychological practice on my computer.<eos> Then I was hacked, and as a result, one of my patients was murdered.<eos> My investigation into her death led me to the FBI, where I joined a team of cyber experts to wage a war against a new breed of criminal hiding on the Deep Web... infiltrating our daily lives in ways we never imagined faceless... nameless... lurking inside our devices,<eos> just a keystroke away.<eos> Hi.<eos> Surprised I could get a ZoGo at this crazy hour.<eos> You guys still taking the online coupon?<eos> Hey, what'd you say your name was again?<eos> I didn't.
Tamsin: The Ancients aren't exactly known for their honesty.<eos> Is there any chance Hades was conned?<eos> There are rumors that Zeus tricked Hades.<eos> That Hades was enticed to draw the short straw by a woman wearing a necklace of seduction.<eos> It's called The Brísingamen.<eos> Freyja.<eos> Thanks, Trick.<eos> What are you two up to, anyway?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> Just doing a little Intel.

You're right, I can't fake it.<eos> I know a fraud when I see one.<eos> And buddy, you're it.<eos> So, if you try to go after my friends, just know you'll have to go through me first.<eos> Too bad you're stuck in here.<eos> Is that what I am?<eos> Stop beating yourself up.<eos> Bo, if I had just given her the serum when I had the chance...<eos> Look, you had no way of knowing.<eos> But now you do.

A whole lot more noise than Zoey can make by herself.<eos> Confession...<eos> I am your union rep.<eos> - What?<eos> No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's an elected position, meaning you probably voted for me.<eos> Or not.<eos> I think I voted for that nurse with the baby arm.<eos> Of course you did.
Yes, I just need to get some air.<eos> Everybody okay in there?<eos> No one critical?<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> How's your crew holding up?<eos> The entire ER nursing staff of a major city hospital walked out and nobody cared, so it's a tragedy.<eos> - Do you want some help?<eos> - From you?<eos> Just 'cause I'm not standing out here with you guys doesn't mean that I don't agree with what you're doing.<eos> Actually, it does.
What kind of sin is he about to commit?<eos> (people chatting, gasping)<eos> This is pretty serious, ms. Calder.<eos> Your blood pressure's very low, which is why you fainted.<eos> I want to run some more tests, but i will say that a hematoma That size should not just appear overnight.<eos> I probably just bumped into something Without realizing it, that's all.<eos> You need to be admitted to a hospital.<eos> This could be serious, and until We figure out what's going on, I want you monitored.<eos> I can have an ambulance Transfer you to the nearest cardiology lab If you don't have someone who can drive you.<eos> I do.
I watched my mother... suffer and die so that some insurance company could increase its profit margin.<eos> I know.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I was abandoned once. Cast aside by those who should've cared, but I stood up and fought back.<eos> And you can do the same, Leland.<eos> Do you know what it's like to lose someone?<eos> To have them just snatched away from you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Wes!<eos> I can't believe you'd do this, that you would take Sean without even having the guts to talk to me about it first.<eos> I didn't have any say in any of this.<eos> You sat there on the phone with me last night, asking me questions... I don't...<eos> I don't agree with how this was handled, but Sean is the only one with inside information about this thing.<eos> He's a person, not some object for you to have your scientist experiments on. They're your scientists, too, Claire.<eos> They work for all of us.<eos> This isn't some underground, mercenary operation.<eos> This is the sovereign, federal government of the United States of America trying to protect our children from a threat that we don't fully understand.<eos> But Sean does, Wes.
My lawyer called three times.<eos> How the fuck did my hearing get moved up to today?<eos> Because I pulled every string to get you back on the floor before this place closes.<eos> A thank-you would be nice.<eos> Yeah, I, uh, need to tell you something confidentially as my lawyer, and I need you to not freak out.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> There is a small chance that, uh, I might have some drugs in my system.<eos> I have not used.<eos> I had a pill in my mouth less than an hour ago for... all right, this sounds terrible.<eos> Yes, it does.
That's curious, don't you think?<eos> I'm sure he had his reasons.<eos> And I wonder why you're lying to me, Ted.<eos> I'm not lying to you, Janet.<eos> Okay, maybe not, but you're sure not telling me something.<eos> I asked him to leave.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> And I asked him to tell you the reason.<eos> Well, he didn't.
Why's the treasure in a grave?<eos> There was no treasure in the grave. No.<eos> This is what pirates do.<eos> They leave a map or a code that needs to be ciphered.<eos> This is typical, classic pirate bullshit.<eos> Fell for it again.<eos> Do you think Injun Joe was here?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But whoever was here, they don't know where the treasure is and we do.<eos> We do.
Cute shirt, by the way.<eos> Have I borrowed that?<eos> Probably not.<eos> Well, maybe I should.<eos> Can I get a refill?<eos> I didn't sleep last night.<eos> Aria, I was here all night.<eos> Holbrook didn't come to the party.<eos> There's no way he could have left you that bookmark.<eos> All right, well, somebody did.
You know that.<eos> Don't make a fuss.<eos> Morris!<eos> It's the phone!<eos> It's happened again! Hello?<eos> Guy.<eos> What?<eos> This is it, this is, er...<eos> This must be just after Morris left.<eos> No, don't do that!

Let's do this.<eos> Ready to do this?<eos> Let's do this, baby.<eos> I wanna ask you a question that was asked of me late last night.<eos> Simple question, but one that rocked me to my core.<eos> It affected me so deeply, so profoundly, it could only have come from the Holy Spirit.<eos> The question I was asked was:<eos> "Do you believe in the cross of Christ?"<eos> I mean, that's a simple one for me to answer.<eos> Of course I do.
And his spirit in us gives us all believers the power over the temptations of this world.<eos> The cross of Jesus Christ promises to love you, forgive you, and give you a new life right now.<eos> Hold it right there!<eos> We all, as captives, are free from the bondage of this flesh.<eos> You know, he's saving a seat up there for you.<eos> Nah, I ain't staying.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I think you should.<eos> Man, you don't know me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Teri, Kathleen is gone.<eos> She's not away at college or working in Minneapolis.<eos> She's not coming back for Christmas.<eos> I know that, J.D, but this is my daughter's room.<eos> This is all I have left.<eos> This is not a room, sweetheart, it's a museum.<eos> We're not honoring her memory, we're living in the past.<eos> What else are we supposed to do?<eos> Teri, the world didn't end when she died.<eos> Ours did.

How about you?<eos> Mmm, I don't know.<eos> I think I'm still in the beginning stages of feeling sorry for myself.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, you some kind of religious nut or something?<eos> No, no, hardly.<eos> My sister gave me this.<eos> Her husband got saved a couple years back, and so Elena, she-- that's my sister-- she, I don't know, think she's, like, half saved, or five-eighths.<eos> I don't really think it works that way.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Right now, you need to be worried about your future.<eos> My money.<eos> Your money.<eos> It's right here.<eos> I haven't touched it.<eos> Show it to me.<eos> Now what would Jesus think about you trying to take my money?<eos> I think he would know I didn't want it in the first place.<eos> So you believe in Jesus?<eos> I do.

Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, we had a little accident, but I'm fine.<eos> I'd say so.<eos> Hey, I think somebody over there might like to see you.<eos> Joe!<eos> Hey, my little butterfly.<eos> You're looking better.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look, I brought your angel back to you.<eos> Yes, you did.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey, Joe.<eos> - How's the leg?<eos> Eh, gets me out of raking leaves.<eos> I want to thank you for taking them in.<eos> Oh, we're blessed to have them.<eos> We're one big family now.<eos> See, Mommy?<eos> God really does love us.<eos> He does, baby.
You're a survivor.<eos> Everything else just dust in your eyes.<eos> Blink it away, man.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll get your stuff.<eos> Take it to another hotel, all right?<eos> I just don't know how to be... out in the world, man.<eos> Hey, look out that window.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Nobody does.
And when I ran out of the woods and they found me...<eos> The woods?<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> You said...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Hey, look, I don't think...<eos> This wouldn't help you.<eos> It might.<eos> It usually does.
Where are you taking me?<eos> Me?<eos> Nowhere. This bus goes to Seattle.<eos> Hits a couple stops in between.<eos> You get out of here.<eos> Forget this.<eos> Maybe it can blow over for you.<eos> This is never gonna blow over.<eos> My life ended that day.<eos> Except it didn't.
Lie down, Frank.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I don't know, boy.<eos> I don't think them other kids like you.<eos> I don't think anybody does.<eos> Who the fuck wants some lanky loudmouth pissing in their ear, huh?<eos> Your mother sure didn't.
That kind of money, I can't blame him.<eos> You've already been questioned regarding Rinaldo Pazzi's murder, Signor Crawford.<eos> Since you're not in Florence on official FBI business, that will be all.<eos> Not you, Signora Fell.<eos> You stay right where you are.<eos> This is going to hurt.<eos> That bullet is still inside you.<eos> Chiyoh has always been very protective of me.<eos> Did she kill her tenant? Or did you?<eos> She did.
I've got everything I need from you now.<eos> You can't kill me, Margot.<eos> You'll lose everything.<eos> "In the absence of an heir, the sole beneficiary is the Southern Baptist Church."<eos> But there is going to be an heir, Mason.<eos> A Verger baby.<eos> Yours, mine...<eos> - Mostly yours.<eos> - Do you know what happens if we stimulate your prostate gland with a cattle prod?<eos> Hannibal does.
I hear you say that, and I ask myself, "is that grief?<eos> They let you out?<eos> I had an alibi.<eos> Well, then why didn't you come forward?<eos> My alibi was Nicole, and I didn't want to hurt Jess.<eos> Or you didn't want the MPs to find you.<eos> So brave when they're watching.<eos> People like you, buddy, have no idea.<eos> In World War II, guys saw 40 days in combat the whole war.<eos> In Iraq, I did 310 my first tour alone.

You expect me to say thank you?<eos> If I didn't need you alive, we wouldn't be having this conversation.<eos> So you just stand there and let me die, huh?<eos> But you couldn't kill me yourself.<eos> Is that where you draw the line?<eos> Tell me what I want to know about Fisk.<eos> You think you're different... from me?<eos> From him?<eos> But you'll get there.<eos> Sooner or later... we all do, men like us.
Oh, nice to see you, too, detective.<eos> This is assistant district attorney steve kines.<eos> I hate him.<eos> Love affair gone bad?<eos> Both: No.<eos> My theory is our missing musician Is a material witness in your case against the doctor.<eos> Rehab was a last-ditch effort to get him clean Before propping him up in front of a grand jury.<eos> Great.

'Cause I give a shit.<eos> 'Cause when you focus on other people's problems it's a lot easier to ignore your own.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing. Just-- just some NA bullshit.<eos> I'm here because I like you, asshole.<eos> You know, it's as if no one's ever said "No" to you, and you can't stand it.<eos> Now, you wait until your target's vulnerable, - then you pounce.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Tell me what you're here for, Fiona.<eos> - I just did.
Paige, you don't have to go.<eos> They arrested Alison for killing Mona.<eos> She's in jail.<eos> She won't stay there.<eos> Yes, she will.<eos> Tell your parents, they have to let you stay.<eos> It's safe now.<eos> Emily, I have to go.<eos> Listen to me, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
There is no Lip Gallagher on my class list.<eos> Right, no, yeah, there was a slight hiccup with Financial Aid.<eos> Uh, but, you know, I wanted to hit the ground running for when it gets sorted out.<eos> And you're interested in critical theory and postmodern thought?<eos> Absolutely, yeah.<eos> Yeah, you know, and also a lot of the other classes were already full, so it was between this and environmental studies.<eos> And hippies don't use deodorant, so...<eos> Do you even know what critical theory is?<eos> Is that a trick question?<eos> You don't, do you?
Was your wife, and you need to deal with her.<eos> I can't talk to her. You know that.<eos> Hell, I can't even talk to my own son anymore.<eos> I need help.<eos> So if you could just... Give her some perspective...<eos> Nobody gives that woman perspective.<eos> - Barb has a heart. She does.<eos> - After all this, you think that... that...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Sí.<eos> No tengo que hablar contigo.<eos> Me puedo ir a mi quarto.<eos> Mmhmm. - Esta tranquilo ahi, no hay mujeres...<eos> - Mm-hmm. Why you even come?<eos> It's the only way I can lay eyes on you... When you're locked down in jail.<eos> What the... is wrong with you, Hector?<eos> You lie and lie.<eos> Cincos años and nothing from you.<eos> Well, I don't...
This early, huh?<eos> I'm gonna be up three straight days once this hurricane hits.<eos> I need to get all the sleep I can.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I'll leave you be.<eos> Have one of the stewards wake me when it hits the coast.<eos> Francis.<eos> Francis?<eos> Where did it make landfall?<eos> - It didn't.
Meth head with a gun, I didn't want to be anywhere around him.<eos> Is this the same gun Mr. Nix had that night? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> - You're sure?<eos> Y-yeah, I'm sure!<eos> We have an issue.<eos> This wasn't the gun that was used to kill Matt Skokie.<eos> This also is not the gun that was in Carter Nix's possession when he was arrested.<eos> Do you understand what the problem is, Hector?<eos> I mean, um, it looked like the gun.<eos> No, it didn't.
And clearly, you have plans for Roy.<eos> Smart.<eos> Now, I'm just looking to see if I fit in anywhere.<eos> Lucille: Well, you're cute.<eos> But I got that one covered. For now.<eos> What else you bring to the party?<eos> Just ask Roy.<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> I like you.<eos> I do.
Gregory Mitchell?<eos> Yeah, you know, I could help you run them down.<eos> I have plenty of time.<eos> You know what, I...<eos> I need to do it myself.<eos> But thank you.<eos> Yeah, it's Gregory Mitchell.<eos> Any grade.<eos> I don't know how old he is.<eos> You do?
Regular for you would be staying out of trouble for six months.<eos> Regular for you would be buying a decent shirt and going to work on the first day.<eos> Why you always trying to make it so big?<eos> Why can't you just please try to do some regular... Okay?<eos> It's all gonna work.<eos> It's all gonna work out.<eos> Come on, papi.<eos> Eat it.<eos> I came here because you and I actually have a lot in common.<eos> We do?
I've made my choice.<eos> You'll die for this.<eos> Not by your hand.<eos> Come on, Athos!<eos> Vargas.<eos> Vargas!<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where is Rochefort?<eos> He didn't send you the letter.<eos> I did.
Good.<eos> Good.<eos> Good.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I don't want to talk about it right now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This is not what I intended.<eos> He can hear you.<eos> - He doesn't understand.<eos> - Yes, he does.
Yeah.<eos> You know, when you were a baby.<eos> Baby.<eos> You know, like, goo-goo, mama, itty-bitty baby shit.<eos> - Mom?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Monster, do you know where babies come from?<eos> Does he know anything?<eos> He does.<eos> He does.
Not really what I expected.<eos> You sure this one's to be trusted?<eos> She knows this one's to be trusted.<eos> No more games, Tobin.<eos> I'm just surprised Sifter let you keep the party going.<eos> Trust a black hat once, shame on them.<eos> Trust a black hat twice...<eos> How long do you think you can deny the thirst, Nelson?<eos> You have no idea how much money can be made selling the secrets at your fingertips.<eos> But I do.
Or he's playing us, and he's gonna disappear just like...<eos> Like Tobin?<eos> Black hats are hardwired to buck the system.<eos> Most can't be reformed.<eos> What do you want me to say, Elijah?<eos> I was wrong about Tobin.<eos> I will be wrong again.<eos> But I am not wrong about Nelson.<eos> I want you to be right, okay?<eos> I really do.
I'm nothing like him.<eos> What happened to your friends with the beards?<eos> They're all dead.<eos> You sure do have a knack for survival.<eos> You left me there to die, Sheriff.<eos> I'm not the sheriff.<eos> What do you want, an apology?<eos> I would have done the same thing.<eos> You know, being the sheriff never really suited you.<eos> No, it didn't.
What were the yards like?<eos> Big, fenced, with trees. Why?<eos> If this pilgrim feels a special relationship with the moon, he might like to go outside and look at it, before he tidies himself up.<eos> If one were nude, say, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for that sort of thing.<eos> One must show some consideration for the neighbours.<eos> Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight, Will?<eos> It appears quite black.<eos> You've come to wag your finger?<eos> I love a good finger-wagging.<eos> Yes, you do.
Not very handsome, but purposeful.<eos> He has a family.<eos> Save yourself.<eos> Kill them all.<eos> I have a little homework.<eos> Sure.<eos> If I'm keeping you from working, I can go.<eos> No.<eos> I want you to be here.<eos> I do.
Because I married your mum?<eos> Then you shouldn't put this guy in a mental hospital, you should kill him.<eos> I want to watch baseball.<eos> His team playing?<eos> He read about me in a Freddie Lounds article.<eos> I had to justify myself to an eleven-year-old.<eos> Resentment's raising a blister in you, Will.<eos> You think you might lose me after this, Jack?<eos> You think I might go back to my family?<eos> - For a minute, I did.
I never hurt you.<eos> I never wanted to.<eos> Let's just be friends and have a good time and forget about this...<eos> Shut up.<eos> I'm going to tell you something.<eos> The most important thing that you will ever hear.<eos> "Sermon-on-the-Mount" important.<eos> "Ten-Commandments" important.<eos> Got it?<eos> - Yes, D. I don't...
If you believe that sort of thing.<eos> I'm not sure what I believe.<eos> I'm not sure of anything any more.<eos> You're a far cry from the man I sailed the ocean with, to wherever the fuck that was.<eos> The Da Vinci I knew then tempted fate with his own purpose.<eos> He knew what he wanted from the world and he made it happen.<eos> I would have done anything for that man.<eos> There's nothing to do, but wait until the dawn.<eos> If he survives he will be with us.<eos> And if he does not?
It's a lot different when you're face-to-face with one that wants to kill you.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Well, glad I could help.<eos> I can go, right?<eos> Yeah, thanks, Bud.<eos> It's a relief to know.<eos> Well, for you to know, because I already know.<eos> Anything else, just call.<eos> Well, you're still here, so I have to assume you have a new understanding of the world we live in.<eos> I do, sir.
- I don't know.<eos> - I haven't seen them.<eos> The last I saw, he was chasing after Riken.<eos> You should have killed me when you had the chance.<eos> I'm gonna kill you now.<eos> Like hell you are.<eos> We've got to find Monroe and Rosalee.<eos> There!<eos> Did anybody get away?<eos> Because Riken sure didn't.
He's done nothing, said nothing.<eos> Please, do not undo the work.<eos> Quiet, please.<eos> Charlotte Parthenay died in my arms.<eos> Your musket, was it?<eos> I wouldn't try to run.<eos> Might give you a shock.<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> But you were there.<eos> Who did?
Please, do not undo the work.<eos> Quiet, please.<eos> Charlotte Parthenay died in my arms.<eos> Your musket, was it?<eos> I wouldn't try to run.<eos> Might give you a shock.<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> But you were there.<eos> Who did?<eos> Who did?
It'll look a little conspicuous where we're going next.<eos> I was analyzing the particulates that Clay Parker and Shawna Baez left behind, and I found something very interesting.<eos> When Clay's cells come into contact with Shawna's, they adopt her properties.<eos> Something bothering you?<eos> Why would you ask that?<eos> You're doing that biting-your-lower-lip thing that you do when something's bothering you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Cisco says I don't have a life.<eos> You don't, do you?<eos> I do!
Paris, in France - wow.<eos> That's exciting.<eos> The only French I know is..<eos> ...half a grapefruit.<eos> - Um, you have some ketchup on your nose.<eos> - I'm sorry, what?<eos> - Ketchup. - Oh!<eos> I put ketchup on my ketchup.<eos> - Those shoes look like they would hurt a lot.<eos> - Yeah, they do.
Keep going.<eos> Julia?<eos> Junior?<eos> Junior?<eos> Did you speak with him?<eos> How are you, Sam?<eos> I'm well.<eos> As well as can be expected.<eos> Day by day, you know?<eos> I do.
What are you thinking?<eos> That I really want a drink.<eos> Well, it's good there's not a bar around.<eos> You think there's no options in here?<eos> You'd be amazed by the options.<eos> You don't need a drink, Sam.<eos> What you need... is to forgive yourself.<eos> I don't know if I can do that.<eos> Not if Joe can't forgive me.<eos> And what if he doesn't?
We're not monsters!<eos> We don't tie people up and hold them captive against their will.<eos> Who have you all become?<eos> What do we do? You tell me.<eos> Where's Bonnie?<eos> Still trying to get ahold of her.<eos> Find her.<eos> Was that Frank again?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> - Yeah, it kind of does.
He saw Rebecca the night Lila was killed wet, and... and she dosed him with PCP because she knew he was a potential witness.<eos> PCP doesn't put you in a mental institution.<eos> Rebecca's right.<eos> And where's the actual evidence that this was a crime of passion?<eos> Or are we supposed to just trust you, Mr. Walsh?<eos> And the detectives could have told Rebecca that Lila was strangled before they started taping her confession.<eos> And Rebecca lying about having Lila's phone doesn't mean that she's a killer.<eos> I mean, where's the facts?<eos> An explanation of how she got Lila's body up to the water tank?<eos> She didn't.
I was unfair to you.<eos> I apologize for that and all the hurtful things I said to you.<eos> I have seen the error of my ways, and you're not the girl I said you were.<eos> So... Would you reach out to him?<eos> I know he acts strong, but he's waiting to hear from you...<eos> I am that girl.<eos> The one that tried to slap you, from the backwater bayou, that Southern ghetto trash.<eos> I just spent a long time trying to hide her away so I could claim the prince.<eos> Your shining, black, perfect son of a prince.<eos> And I did.
So I'm done.<eos> I was worried when I first found out you and Wes were involved.<eos> Because of you.<eos> I saw you for who you were.<eos> I recognized you.<eos> You're angry, you lash out, you use people.<eos> But only because you don't know better.<eos> Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.<eos> And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.<eos> He still does.
Rebecca!<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> She was gone when I got down there.<eos> Who was it?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Who let her go?<eos> Who let her go, damn it? !<eos> I didn't let her go.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> I do.
I love you.<eos> I know that now.<eos> It's just... Just taken me a while to accept it.<eos> But Annalise and I, we...<eos> We've been over for years now.<eos> And when I met you... I haven't felt this way in a long time, and I don't ever want to not feel this way again.<eos> It's you, Lila.<eos> I love you.<eos> Because what matters now is that... Sam killed Lila.<eos> He did.
- And after now?<eos> When you go home to her? I'm alone again, having a baby all by myself.<eos> You don't have to do this, Lila.<eos> You're 21 years old...<eos> I want this baby even if you don't.<eos> So stop trying to change my mind. I'm not going to.<eos> You said you loved me over and over.<eos> But you don't, do you?<eos> You love her.<eos> No. I don't.

The kid's down there.<eos> You're the one making all the noise.<eos> What's up, boy? You good?<eos> You want some breakfast?<eos> No, I want that shit you've been holding for me.<eos> - Still got it after all these years?<eos> - I just might.<eos> Let me go see.<eos> Your mama got the best ass in New York City.<eos> Always did.
See you later.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Morning.<eos> Ghost is in the shower, but there's hot coffee while you wait.<eos> Nothing happened between me and your girl.<eos> You and Keisha are single.<eos> If y'all wanna do it, be my guest.<eos> I don't want to keep playing these games.<eos> I like you. You like me, too.<eos> And what if I do?
Motherfucker was in my house while I was gone!<eos> I didn't touch your girl!<eos> She ain't even my type!<eos> - What the fuck does that mean?<eos> - Tommy!<eos> I don't fucking need you alienating our right fucking hand over some bitch.<eos> Call Holly a bitch again.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Tommy, alls I'm saying, man, is you're about to do Julio and do me over some broad you don't trust. - I trust her! - You don't.<eos> No, you don't.
You can't serious.<eos> You're asking me to commit fraud.<eos> Can you please watch your voice, sir?<eos> You're asking me to risk losing my license, lose my hospital.<eos> That's criminal.<eos> You're just a thug.<eos> Dr. Calhoun, if the IPO goes through and I die, Anika will become a billionaire in her own right.<eos> But it will not happen if I can't get... A key man policy.<eos> Does Anika know about this?<eos> No, she does not.
It means a lot to me that we're friends again, and I, um...<eos> We could finally just talk about it.<eos> It's...<eos> There's nothing to discuss, Jemma.<eos> Maybe there is.<eos> Agent Fitz, we're on the move.<eos> I'd like to formally voice my doubts About bringing him on this mission.<eos> I understand your concerns, May, But Cal's lived with the Inhumans.<eos> He knows what we're getting ourselves into.<eos> We do not.
What's that?<eos> Nice gambit, Harrison, but this isn't over.<eos> Hartley, what do you want? What do you want?<eos> I already gave my mea culpa today.<eos> The city already hated you.<eos> You don't think I noticed that press conference was a pathetic bishop sacrifice?<eos> No, no, no, I've played with you too many times to let you get away with that.<eos> This is between you, me and the Flash.<eos> You don't wanna play for those kind of stakes with me, Hartley.<eos> Actually, I really do.
Yeah, you remember him?<eos> I'm sure he means well, but you need to be with people who accept you for who you are.<eos> And they're out there.<eos> You should never apologize for being you.<eos> You, Ian.<eos> I love you.<eos> Should we dance on the tables?<eos> Well, it's an option, but I know what you really want.<eos> You do?<eos> I do.
The crack pipe is bad enough, but this guy?<eos> If you beat the cancer and learn you have AIDS--<eos> Oh, God-- how did you even find me?<eos> Did you follow us here?<eos> - You texted me.<eos> - What?<eos> I woke to your text this morning asking us to get you, with the address.<eos> Even said you'd leave the door open. - See?<eos> - No, I never sent that.<eos> Well, someone did.
- He gave me your number, and he said I should reach out.<eos> He said...<eos> He said you're kind of a punk and owe him money.<eos> Yeah, you know Edgar. Here's what's up...<eos> Uh, text me where you're at and I'll roll through.<eos> Hey, you Tony? - Yeah.<eos> - That's for Edgar.<eos> Tell him I put a little sweetness on top so he can shut up.<eos> He good to you in juvie?<eos> Yeah, he did some good looking out.
I don't understand.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> - Go!<eos> - Okay.<eos> Nice touch with the whiskey.<eos> I know how much you hate parting with good booze.<eos> Oh, come on now, what am I, a rookie?<eos> I got the good stuff in the wheel well.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> Of course I do.
Good-bye, John.<eos> Good luck.<eos> This is where Anne Marie found him.<eos> Even if we get in, I'm still not sure what we'll be able to do for him.<eos> John's more prepared than even I realized.<eos> You're gonna have to sneak a couple things in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Assyrian exorcism rite.<eos> How did he know he'd need that exact spell?<eos> He didn't.
No security cameras, no fingerprints.<eos> Guy was in and out like a ghost. Yeah.<eos> The murder victim, Edward Hu, he was the key witness in a murder investigation of one Kelvin Bittaker, who beat a guy to death over a spilled drink.<eos> The family has been of interest to the Dallas F.B.I. for some time.<eos> Their import/export car warehouse is a front.<eos> This murder case -- this is just a thin edge of the wedge.<eos> Now the hope here is to use Kelvin's conviction to take the whole family down.<eos> Kelvin might be looking at the needle, which might make him more pliable.<eos> Now how said the hope is, not was, from which I surmise that you have another witness to the murder?<eos> We do.
I like him too.<eos> But there's nothing I can do, not with the way things are.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Look, I'm glad we took down Flass, but there are people you go after and people you don't.<eos> So now everything we do is being watched.<eos> You got the bad guy.<eos> I'm sorry you got dragged into it.<eos> Don't be.<eos> Felt good.<eos> Did, didn't it?
And I'm like, fine, mom.<eos> Be a drunken whore, even.<eos> But don't be... a nagging... drunken whore.<eos> You know?<eos> Don't come yell at me to do the dishes... if you've been banging!<eos> ... a clown in the next room!<eos> You know?<eos> Long night, huh?<eos> Guess it got kind of ugly.<eos> Yes, it did.
He might not be in here.<eos> You see that?<eos> No, 'cause you took my glasses.<eos> Right there, underneath his coat.<eos> He's wearing a work shirt.<eos> "Kleg's Auto."<eos> Idiot.<eos> "The Red Hood Gang"!<eos> It's got a ring to it.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Is the party over?<eos> I... prepared a song. It...<eos> It includes a dance and everything.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I'm... Miriam Loeb.<eos> Did... Did my father send you?<eos> Miss Kringle.<eos> Oh, Mr. Nygma.<eos> Miss Kringle, I was wondering if you had dinner plans this evening.<eos> Actually, I... I do.
I don't know.<eos> Is your boyfriend gonna come home?<eos> I never said I had a boyfriend.<eos> I... assumed a woman as beautiful as you...<eos> You assumed I had a boyfriend and you assumed I would be the kind of woman who would cheat on him.<eos> Well, I'm not.<eos> And I don't have a boyfriend.<eos> And if a bus hit me tomorrow, huh, no one would care.<eos> That change things?<eos> Yes, actually it does.
I wanna apologize for my outburst in there.<eos> It was uncalled for.<eos> I have a little trouble dealing with my anger sometimes.<eos> Join the club.<eos> Yeah, something I'm working on, but this alien stuff messed with my head.<eos> And losing Trip brought back a lot of hard memories. For all of us.<eos> Well, I hope I didn't blow my chance to work on Lola one day.<eos> After that little RC version you built for me, I'm genuinely considering it.<eos> Although, I couldn't figure out how to make it fly.<eos> It doesn't.
Why did you come here?<eos> These transformed beings are abominations.<eos> I knew that I had to find the remainder of the Diviners before another monstrosity occurred, and erase any knowledge of it.<eos> How many Diviners are supposed to be in that crate?<eos> Enough to create an army.<eos> Sir, the crate is empty.<eos> My worst fear has come true.<eos> We have to assume they were all taken at the same time back in the '40s.<eos> Does that mean HYDRA has them?<eos> And if HYDRA doesn't, who does?
I get it.<eos> Didn't expect you to stay and roast marshmallows.<eos> This is temporary, Skye.<eos> I'll be back in a couple of days.<eos> - If you need anything... - I'll let you know.<eos> We'll figure this out.<eos> I promise.<eos> Captain Anderson, I believe your daughter goes to school with my boy.<eos> I don't have a daughter, sir.<eos> No, you do not.
I know that Fury brought you back from the dead.<eos> Right.<eos> I didn't ask for that. But I've come to appreciate the gesture.<eos> And that he filled your veins with alien blood.<eos> God knows what that did.<eos> Weaver thinks it made you into some kind of a messenger for an alien race.<eos> Can you say with certainty that that's not true?<eos> And we haven't even begun to talk about your protégé, Skye.<eos> You two have a lot in common.<eos> At least, you once did.
Seven agents down, Calderon barely hanging on, and you want to defend that thing?<eos> She's a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, not a thing.<eos> What happened wasn't her fault.<eos> I was there. Calderon fired at her.<eos> She was armed and hostile.<eos> She was scared and defending herself.<eos> I don't care if she was chasing butterflies.<eos> We can't wear kid gloves around something with powers of that magnitude.<eos> - She could've killed everyone.<eos> - But she didn't.
She fled Russia unharmed.<eos> Looks pretty strong to me, So it's important we don't spook her.<eos> Just a friendly chat to bring her in for evaluation.<eos> And if all goes really well, We'd gain an asset before the russians find her.<eos> The approach will be public.<eos> It's not ideal, but we go in now, we lose our window.<eos> Local military's not used to standing down.<eos> Welcome to Bahrain.<eos> Let's hope Belyakov cooperates.<eos> And if she doesn't?
Eh, bio always works. My name is Phil Coulson.<eos> I represent the Strategic<eos> Homeland Intervention Enforcement Logistics Division, And you are about to enter a quarantine site.<eos> Colonel, you can't send your men in there!<eos> A biological weapon was set off!<eos> Nasty stuff... Flesh-eating.<eos> Weapons sale gone bad with the Russians.<eos> Give my team time to assess.<eos> Did you say, "Biological Weapon"?<eos> Yes, I did.
And suddenly, it is.<eos> Uh these are for you.<eos> I want to thank you... Both of you... For giving me another shot.<eos> I know that my actions...<eos> I learned who my mother was today, And she... Taught me things.<eos> I've never had that before.<eos> That was possible because of you.<eos> That's all I really wanted for you.<eos> Cal, uh, Skye doesn't know when her birthday is.<eos> I do. July 2nd.
I asked him to go and protect you. To keep you safe.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> I should never have let you go at all.<eos> It was the right thing to do.<eos> We have to make sure that the Cal that we put out into the world is the same Cal that I've seen here.<eos> The safe and user-friendly Cal.<eos> You were trying to make it easy on him.<eos> You were being compassionate.<eos> How do we get Lincoln back?<eos> We don't.
Hello?<eos> Sounds like you made it out okay.<eos> I'm surprised you didn't join us.<eos> Thought it might be in my best interest to find an exit that wouldn't, oh, land me in a cell afterwards. Or, you know, my brain erased.<eos> Well, I'm glad you made it out all right.<eos> Yeah, we both know that's not true, Coulson.<eos> You wanna tell me what this call's really about?<eos> I always knew the team wasn't going to forgive me.<eos> Some people just don't deserve forgiveness.<eos> But Kara, she does.
Bastard sold us out!<eos> Put the gun down, now.<eos> It was the only way. - I won't warn you again.<eos> - Will you just listen to me?<eos> Do you want to get to Strucker or not?<eos> - Fitz? Are you all right?<eos> - Yeah, I'm delightful.<eos> Strucker wants powered people.<eos> Bakshi alone doesn't get you to him.<eos> Deathlok does.
Previouslyon "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> - Why should I trust you?<eos> - Because we all have our secrets.<eos> You have one sitting in the cargo hold of your ship.<eos> Some people just don't deserve forgiveness.<eos> - Kara? - She does.
I know that Whitehall subjected you to unspeakable horrors, that he took everything from you.<eos> A good man, Phil Coulson, put a bullet in him.<eos> - Where did you...?<eos> - SHIELD recovered it from Whitehall's office after his death.<eos> I know that you were separated from your daughter.<eos> I thought that that might belong to her.<eos> A traditional Chinese gift to ward off evil spirits, isn't it?<eos> I never got a chance to give it to her.<eos> I kept hoping that if she was alive, evil would never find her.<eos> Not like it did me.
So why is it colder than bloody blue hell down here, huh?<eos> And, uh, what's with the, uh... the doodad on my wrist, huh?<eos> That doodad monitors your vitals.<eos> I'll get you another blanket if you'd like, or maybe some hot cocoa.<eos> Are you mocking me?<eos> Torturing me after I willingly turned myself in?<eos> Torture isn't my thing, Cal, and surrender doesn't really seem like yours.<eos> Why did Jiaying send you?<eos> - Do you have children, Phil?<eos> - I do not.
Tragedy literally struck here five years ago, when Stetson Donovan and his wife, Patty, were found dead in each other's arms, killed by a massive jolt of electricity.<eos> Paul, get a little closer.<eos> Yeah, that's good.<eos> Skulls cracked, teeth literally shattered, eyes literally blown out.<eos> Nasty stuff.<eos> Legend has it, the husband's ghost roams here at night, mourning his soul mate, unable to pass on, while their killer, having never been found, walks free.<eos> No justice, no peace indeed.<eos> Really?<eos> You're gonna say that?<eos> He just did.
He didn't want to carry a gun anymore.<eos> My last words to him were that... he was weak.<eos> That he could never be a Panther, and... he was no brother to me anymore.<eos> That's why he was home.<eos> I fired him.<eos> His whole life, all I ever did was rag on him.<eos> I... I know it feels that way now, but you gotta give yourself a break, Bunchy.<eos> Families are... all the same.<eos> They don't work.<eos> But they do.
Howard.<eos> Peg, is this real?<eos> Bring him home.<eos> Howard!<eos> How long until he reaches New York?<eos> 12 minutes.<eos> Maybe less.<eos> Maybe we could talk him down.<eos> You think he'd listen?<eos> Chief did.
My boy said you had plenty to say to him.<eos> I put myself out there.<eos> You think it's my fault they don't see it, what I could bring?<eos> You wanna call me a loser to my face, you little shit?<eos> I didn't call you a loser, man.<eos> Oh, my boy's a liar now, huh?<eos> He say it, or not?<eos> - Speak up when I'm talking to you.<eos> - He said it.<eos> No, I didn't.

That the rules, the ones people like me and you, the people that work and struggle to live our lives, just live, don't apply to them.<eos> That they can do anything and live happily ever after, while the rest of us suffer.<eos> They do this from the shadows.<eos> Shadows that we cast.<eos> With our indifference.<eos> With a pervasive lack of interest in anything that doesn't directly affect us, we, in the here and now.<eos> Or maybe it's just the shadow of weariness.<eos> Of how tired we are, struggling to claw our way back to a middle class that no longer exist, because of those who take more than they deserve.<eos> And they keep taking, until all that's left for the rest of us is a memory of how it used to be before the corporations and the bottom line decided we didn't matter anymore.<eos> But we do.
Okay, present company excluded.<eos> All I'm saying is Armand Tully is a dead end.<eos> You find something out?<eos> I, um, did a little back-channeling with Marci.<eos> Okay, ew, just...<eos> What did you get?<eos> Tully really is on an island that he bought with the money that Confed Global is paying him for all his real estate holdings in Hell's Kitchen.<eos> Then, that's the link!<eos> I mean, it ties Fisk directly to what's happening in the tenement case.<eos> No, it doesn't.
With things like this?<eos> Not today.<eos> I think I've had enough.<eos> - Tell Foggy I'll see him in the morning.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, Matt.<eos> Yeah?<eos> If there is a God... and if he cares at all about... about any of us... Fisk will get what he deserves.<eos> You have to believe that.<eos> I do.
Bad idea.<eos> Please, stop!<eos> I'm... I'm sick.<eos> Okay!<eos> Okay, the purse!<eos> I'll tell you who snatched it...<eos> Listen, I've hurt a lot of people tonight to get what I need to know.<eos> The asshole that killed Mrs. Cardenas shoots up at this address, likes cheap menthols.<eos> Thinks it covers the stench of his rotting teeth.<eos> It doesn't.
Oh, shit, not Marshall.<eos> "We must dissent from the indifference.<eos> We must dissent from the apathy.<eos> - We must dissent from..." - "From the fear." Yeah, I know.<eos> You've read it a million times.<eos> You think what happened in there today was right?<eos> No, Matt, I don't think it was right.<eos> But according to the law, if he did disclose trade secrets<eos> - to a third party other than his doctor...<eos> - He didn't.
It was a hell of a speech, Fisk.<eos> You ever think about running for office?<eos> I'll leave that to people like you, Senator.<eos> That's a good answer.<eos> You, um... got a minute to talk about that zoning issue?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I'll be back in a minute.<eos> I didn't vote for Senator Cherryh last election.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Few people did.
Lot of that going around.<eos> Seems like it's the only thing we still all have in common.<eos> I'm sorry, Karen.<eos> For which part?<eos> All of it, pretty much.<eos> You want coffee?<eos> Yeah, please.<eos> You know, he thinks he got her killed...<eos> Elena.<eos> He didn't.
It won't be enough.<eos> You sound just like Matt.<eos> You talked to him?<eos> He asked the same about you.<eos> - He did?<eos> - When I was over at his place.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> And don't... don't tell me that it was a car accident.<eos> Ask him.<eos> - I did.
- No, it wasn't.<eos> The cop on the phone, I had a run-in with him before in the mask.<eos> He works for Fisk?<eos> He was talking to someone about Hoffman.<eos> They're looking for him.<eos> Detective Hoffman?<eos> He's alive?<eos> From what I could tell, Owlsley has him holed up somewhere.<eos> Fisk wants him found, bad.<eos> Hell yeah, he does.
I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Well, thank her for us.<eos> For everything she did helping bring Fisk down.<eos> Fisk still needs to go to trial.<eos> Just getting a court date on a case this big could take a year.<eos> - That long?<eos> - He's where he belongs, that's all that matters.<eos> And we put him there.<eos> Yeah, we did.
They have never had compassion for anybody.<eos> Never.<eos> Ever.<eos> Get everything you can out of him and put him into the ground. Immediately.<eos> Understood.<eos> I recognize your face from somewhere.<eos> I am Dr. Jose Manuel Mireles.<eos> The one who's always on TV.<eos> You took out your stitches already?<eos> Yeah. I already did.
Yeah, man.<eos> Maybe you should move down to Louisiana, help me start my fishing business!<eos> You and I together, man, we could catch a lot of shrimp!<eos> I mean, there's rock shrimp, Atlantic shrimp, salt shrimp, boo-boo shrimp, tater shrimp, shrimp on a stick, shrimp remoulade, shrimp in your pasta, you know what, fuck shrimp!<eos> Okay, so, no on the shrimp biz?<eos> What's the situation with your hair?<eos> Did I call your number?<eos> Are we in a deli?<eos> We are not.<eos> And I did not.
I... yes...<eos> No!<eos> You mustn't speak!<eos> I thought I had made that clear.<eos> If you speak, I will have to cut out your brother's throat.<eos> Now then...<eos> Where did your son and queen go?<eos> I'm afraid I don't know.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> None of them do.
- How about fifty?<eos> - Fifty-five.<eos> Fifty-five years.<eos> And what is your name, ma'am?<eos> - Agnes.<eos> - Yeah, I think you mean Saint Agnes. Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Well, Francis and I are only halfway there, but I bet you know your husband as well as you know yourself.<eos> - Am I right?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Lots of Americans, of all ranges of income, choose to send their children to private or parochial schools.<eos> But isn't it true that you want your children to have a leg up on everyone else?<eos> Is that balancing the scales?<eos> Or is that hypocrisy?<eos> Or maybe it's that you didn't want to raise them yourself so you sent them to boarding school.<eos> Wow. You must really want to be president.<eos> I would never in a million years bring up your children in a debate.<eos> The way you choose to raise them is your business.<eos> Do I want the best for my kids?<eos> Yes, I do.
George, I don't think it's so much what Underwood did, but what he didn't do.<eos> He remained presidential.<eos> And when the attacks came his way, he held the high ground.<eos> Now, Dunbar and Sharp, they came out swinging, and I think it hurt them both.<eos> Yeah, but Sharp had to do something.<eos> She's 20 points behind the other two.<eos> But the sexism thing?<eos> And going after Dunbar's kids?<eos> - It seemed quite desperate.<eos> - She did do some damage to Dunbar.
That's the best part.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I'll save you the trouble of trying to convince me.<eos> Claire Underwood.<eos> We need to hit her hard.<eos> You want dirt.<eos> I don't have any.<eos> You must.<eos> If I did, I don't know if I'd shovel it your way.<eos> But I don't.
You should go.<eos> Put this behind you.<eos> I guess it was naive to think that we could remain close.<eos> So this is it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It is.<eos> Jackie?<eos> Jackie...<eos> She says she has it.<eos> She doesn't.
I got to do something before.<eos> I'll see you for our date tonight, okay? I'll be here.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You need something?<eos> I live, um, over the hill...<eos> South face.<eos> You know, we're neighbors.<eos> I-I didn't know that we had any neighbors over the hill on the South face.<eos> Well, you do.
It's just a ceremony.<eos> You can't do it after?<eos> No.<eos> Dr. Hillcroft is going out of town and he's booked solid, so they're squeezing me in.<eos> Just take a couple of deep breaths and relax, okay?<eos> Are you nervous?<eos> A little.<eos> You know I hate needles.<eos> I just need to have faith.<eos> And I do.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Mom...<eos> That's not your fault.<eos> _ _ _<eos> I get that, ma.<eos> But do you think that that's what he'd want?<eos> Because I don't.
I couldn't speak.<eos> And then I saw someone running away... the only other one of us who could find it... the one that got away.<eos> Man... is angry.<eos> Your father... did he ever tell you about the Army of the 12 Monkeys?<eos> Okay, listen, well, that's who we are, and your father is important to us.<eos> I don't want to hurt his daughter, but can you tell me, Jennifer, where to find the Night Room?<eos> The man... he smelled of lavender and jasmine.<eos> Then it was my turn, but he said, "not today."<eos> Those men died because of me. No.<eos> No, they didn't.
Ramse. It's been a while.<eos> Where's the West 7? Huh?<eos> - Where's Deacon? - I don't know.<eos> Don't bullshit me!<eos> Where are they?<eos> How many?<eos> I'm alone, OK? I swear.<eos> - I left the 7.<eos> - Nobody leaves the West 7.<eos> - You and Cole did.
You saw me there, didn't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I stayed away.<eos> I had to follow Henri without you there.<eos> Left just after the quarantine ended.<eos> That was you outside the tents that night.<eos> The lights...<eos> I was wrong about the plague.<eos> People could have died because of me.<eos> But they didn't.
Your move, Allen.<eos> What's next?<eos> So, what's wrong with you?<eos> Why hasn't someone snatched you up yet?<eos> Uh, it's work.<eos> Just a sec.<eos> H9)'-<eos> - Hey, I know you're on a date but we got a jumper on 52nd and Waid.<eos> Sir, please, you have everything to live for.<eos> No, I don't.
Accept each other.<eos> Once more unto the breach, dear friend.<eos> Cait...whatever happens, just remember I'll always love you.<eos> Can you hear me, Ronald? Professor?<eos> It appears we merged properly on this attempt.<eos> Wells was right about balance and accepting.<eos> Behind you!<eos> Ronald, there's more of them.<eos> Eiling, this ends now.<eos> Yes, it does...
Enjoy.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - See you.<eos> Am I supposed to know what that means?<eos> It means that I'm gonna help you figure out what's going on at S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> I think our Burning Man used to work there.<eos> So why'd you bring me here?<eos> I don't know how and I don't know when, but one day soon, I'm gonna be in this house again, 15 years ago.<eos> And I'm gonna fail...<eos> Unless this time, I don't.
Allen, make sure he doesn't go anywhere.<eos> I need to be out there.<eos> Joe, you're always the first one to tell me when I'm not thinking clearly.<eos> I took down Clyde.<eos> I can take down his dirtbag brother too.<eos> You didn't do that alone, remember?<eos> You're right.<eos> How are any of these guys gonna protect me? They don't know.<eos> They don't know what Mardon's capable of.<eos> All right, well, lucky for you, your friends at S.T.A.R. Labs do.
- You used to live there.<eos> I did.<eos> You ever go back?<eos> No.<eos> Too many memories of Tess. That's right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You, Detective, are one of the few people I know that truly understands that kind of loss.<eos> Iris's mother, you never talk about her, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
They're getting away, guys.<eos> They're not getting away, Eddie.<eos> Let's get these bozos up ahead of us first, and then we'll worry about the idiots at the Shiny Diamond.<eos> All right.<eos> We're gonna run out of room, though.<eos> I'll take care of that.<eos> What do you think he meant by that?<eos> That's what he meant.<eos> I think we lost them.<eos> Oh, no, you didn't.
You're out of your mind.<eos> I'm not gonna try and convince you with promises.<eos> But, Detective, give me a chance.<eos> I think we already know what you're capable of, Doctor.<eos> You hurt a lot of people that night.<eos> So those doctors in there, they're good enough?<eos> The best in the city, best in the country.<eos> Look at them. They have no clue what's going on.<eos> They're baffled, and the reason for that is what's happening inside Barry is a mystery, and they don't have the tools to solve it.<eos> - But you do?
So by transitive property, Barry and Iris are our business.<eos> Wait. How did you find out?<eos> When I touched The Flash the other night, I felt a jolt of electricity.<eos> The only other time I have ever felt anything like that was when you were in a coma after the accident.<eos> I can't believe I didn't figure it out sooner.<eos> I can only imagine how angry you are.<eos> I'm not angry, Barry.<eos> I'm just disappointed.<eos> Okay. Does Eddie know?<eos> Yes, he does.
I was.<eos> But now you're not?<eos> What did he do to you?<eos> He didn't do anything to me, Iris.<eos> It's what he showed me.<eos> What could he have shown you that would make you change your mind?<eos> The future.<eos> He showed me the future, Iris.<eos> We don't get married.<eos> You and Barry do.
Relax.<eos> She won't do anything, will you?<eos> Just, um, yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Ready, Warren?<eos> Uh-oh. I think I broke Warren.<eos> Guess you're gonna have to do everything.<eos> We're looking for a friend of yours, likes to put people in boxes.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> No, you don't.
Where did you say you were from?<eos> South Mercia police.<eos> We're looking at an old case.<eos> On 14 April 2012, were you the bridesmaid for Martin and Esther Kelly's wedding at Longthorne Hotel?<eos> I don't know if that was the date but I was at the wedding.<eos> Did you have sex with a man called Ricky Gillespie that night?<eos> Wow, you don't mess about!<eos> You mean Ricky whose girl was killed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, I didn't.
~ Why should the jury believe a single word you say?<eos> You ain't all that.<eos> I wouldn't have gone anywhere near her if I'd seen that!<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry! Do you know what, maybe if you spent a little less time trying to tell me how to do my job and a bit more time on your own work we'd stand a chance of getting him off.<eos> Chin up.<eos> Did you enjoy yourself, lying in there?<eos> It's not my husband in the dock.<eos> ~ I suppose you knew all along.<eos> Of course you did.
~ I've said no. Joe Miller is guilty.<eos> Has he ever categorically confessed his guilt to you?<eos> No.<eos> Why not let the jury decide?<eos> Besides, if you're so sure about his guilt, why have you been visiting him?<eos> He told you? There are no secrets between a barrister and her client. Like the Seal of the Confessional.<eos> I went to see him because I believe in forgiveness and redemption.<eos> I hoped to find a repentant man, but since you showed up that seems to have gone out the window.<eos> You gave the service at Danny's funeral.<eos> I did.
Tricky relationship with her dad.<eos> Still uses her mum's surname.<eos> ~ She babysat for you quite regularly?<eos> ~ Every other week.<eos> Sometimes she'd stay over, other times I'd take her home. ~ Did she have a boyfriend?<eos> ~ No-one regular.<eos> Did you fancy her, Ricky?<eos> She was my niece.<eos> I had to ask.<eos> No, you didn't.
We'll stop now, you can report those offences, I'll be arrested.<eos> You want that?<eos> We can do that.<eos> Say the word.<eos> But that's not why you're here, is it?<eos> You're here because of Lee.<eos> So what are you thinking?<eos> We bring Lee in, he gets a fright seeing that and then, instead of betraying you you're banking on him realising he needs to stay close to you because of what you know.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> I don't.
I didn't get enough.<eos> This was taken a week before, just as you were installing your own floor.<eos> Those boards are not the same boards that are down on that floor now, Lee.<eos> Those are dark oak floorboards.<eos> What's down there now is light oak.<eos> The same light oak boards you bought Saturday morning and again Monday morning.<eos> What did you use those boards for, Lee, between Saturday and Monday?<eos> What happened on the floor, Lee?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No, something did.
Alone.<eos> And I slept.<eos> I don't know for how long.<eos> And then he woke me up.<eos> "Road trip", he said.<eos> We were halfway there when...<eos> I realized... we were going to my parents' house.<eos> Go on.<eos> Well, then he tied them up to a chair... and, uh..., he told me to talk to them... about my childhood issues.<eos> So I did.
You know, I agree with Winthrop.<eos> I'm tired of all the lies.<eos> Based on that conversation, I did a little digging around the Winthrop family tree.<eos> And it turns out that Collin Winthrop had a daughter.<eos> May.<eos> May went missing around age 15.<eos> Police at the time determined that she was not kidnapped.<eos> She just ran away.<eos> And, Brother Larson, I think you know where she ran to.<eos> Hmm. I do not.
You know what this is all about?<eos> Paul Winthrop has been killing his mother over and over, getting ready for his End of Days.<eos> And with Jared gone, that time has come.<eos> Paul will find May.<eos> He will render judgment.<eos> Unless you protect her.<eos> As, apparently, I no longer can.<eos> Okay.<eos> If I'm gonna protect May, I need to know where she is.<eos> You already do.
Home.<eos> - Oh, my God. - Barry.<eos> We have to shut down the Wormhole.<eos> Caitlin.<eos> You didn't save her?<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> You could have had the life you wanted.<eos> You could have had everything you ever wanted!<eos> I already do.
Help me!<eos> -Pick a hand.<eos> -What?<eos> Pick a hand.<eos> -Oooh! You're lucky.<eos> You've seen 'Deer Hunter', right?<eos> It's a classic.<eos> -Pick a hand.<eos> -Please.<eos> Do it.
I'm gonna go check on my sons. Be right back.<eos> Hi, Elle.<eos> * The star of the show tonight. *<eos> How you doing?<eos> Fine, thanks.<eos> I-I know we haven't had a chance to talk much, but I just wanted to take some time to tell you how happy I am that you're here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's a big night for you.<eos> Yeah, if you'd have told me a month ago I was going to be performing again... I wouldn't have believed you.<eos> She did.
You go to the cops, tell them what you know.<eos> That backs up my story.<eos> And then maybe if we're lucky, if we're very lucky, there's proof that Raul threatened Michaels and Lange, just like he threatened you.<eos> I don't want to shit on your pillow, boss, but we've got a couple of glaring problems.<eos> First, Travis is still out there wanting to put a couple of extra holes in your head.<eos> Then there's Cooper.<eos> A psycho ex- compadre who likes burning and blowing shit up.<eos> Doesn't mean Cooper's part of this.<eos> You wanna bet your life on that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Will Tanner's luck hold on?<eos> Will he survive?<eos> Do any of you have the stones to bet it all that Tanner will survive my little game?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets!<eos> That's funny!<eos> Place your bets!<eos> Let's go.<eos> What?<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I figured someone drives by and sees, I'd have to kill them.<eos> You know, and somebody else drives by and sees, and I'd have to kill them.<eos> You know, and another car drives by and sees and I have to kill them.<eos> You know, and...<eos> I mean, 'cause...<eos> He's cool.<eos> I already told him all this shit anyway.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, we had a great talk on the drive over.<eos> He says you guys are with Tigerhawk Security?<eos> He did, huh?
- You all right? ! - I...<eos> I can't hear shit.<eos> Now you think these virgins gonna make it through?<eos> 'Cause I'm thinkin' not.<eos> You gon' be all right!<eos> - Damn it, boy.<eos> - Goddamn.<eos> We're gonna have to let this vent for a few hours.<eos> Now after that '90 collapse over in Joseph's Valley, didn't I hear you swear up and down on your mama's grave that you'd never go in without a good sounding?<eos> I did, indeed.
No one's pinning anything on anyone.<eos> Emma, maybe you should take your friend to see one of those grief counselors.<eos> Hey, Audrey.<eos> Come on.<eos> Audrey.<eos> Look, we're gonna figure this out, I promise.<eos> The crazy thing is, I kind of want it to be Tyler.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I just want it to be over.<eos> Everyone does.
- Yeah, well... Neither did the victims of the BTK Killer till they were staring down the business end of a boning knife.<eos> I thought he was your favorite teacher.<eos> He is.<eos> Which is why the possibility is so alarming.<eos> Maybe he was being manipulated by another psychopath.<eos> Nina.<eos> Nina discovered his secret and blackmailed him into planting the malware.<eos> Then anyone she trolled could have motive.<eos> The guys she slept with...<eos> The guys she didn't.
I said, turn that off!<eos> Audrey, what did you do?<eos> Why'd you make me watch?<eos> I can't un-see that now.<eos> I can't. It can't be how it looks.<eos> You mean how it looks like premeditated murder?<eos> I mean it. I need, like, a Men in Black brain wipe.<eos> She was so angry.<eos> Noah, we both know Audrey.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I came as soon as I heard what was happening.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You're sorry?<eos> Have you talked to Mom?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I wasn't sure she'd let me see you.<eos> In your last letter, you said you were doing good.<eos> My last letter out of the dozens that you've ignored?<eos> I wanted to answer them, Emma.<eos> I did.
That was her bar story.<eos> Yeah, see?<eos> You know her M.O.<eos> Yeah, and I know that that story usually ended with her going home with the guy.<eos> I asked if I could call her a cab.<eos> But she kept insisting that she was gonna drive herself.<eos> So I drove her home.<eos> When we got there, she wanted me to come in.<eos> I...<eos> I didn't.
If you can't hear me and trust me...<eos> Then Branson won.<eos> Even sitting in his jail cell, he beat you.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> Where's Kieran?<eos> He left.<eos> I messed things up royally.<eos> Or maybe he left because he did it.<eos> Audrey, I know that you want justice for Rachel...<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm gonna find him.<eos> And then I'm gonna find you, you sick son of a bitch.<eos> Then let's see what you've learned, Emma.<eos> Can you put all the pieces together in time to save him?<eos> Or will Daisy's heart be broken the way she broke Brandon's?<eos> It's up to you.<eos> But I can promise you one thing, it's gonna be gut-wrenching.<eos> The killer called.<eos> He said that tonight's the big finale.<eos> Of course he did.
It's not Almy's money yet.<eos> Please?<eos> We'll talk about it.<eos> Officer Trotwood?<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Yes. I'm sorry to bother you.<eos> How are you?<eos> Fine, thank you.<eos> Miss Borden, you might not remember me.<eos> Of course I do.
Fellow by the name of Skipjack did most of the damage.<eos> Skipjack works for Flowers.<eos> He was found murdered this morning.<eos> A woman who whored for him shot him through the heart.<eos> Is she alive?<eos> Her throat was cut.<eos> What was her name? The papers didn't say.<eos> It's Adele.<eos> Lizzie said that she thought that this Adele might have run off with Spencer.<eos> Of course she did.
(Siringo) You know that there's a fair in town next week? You like elephants?<eos> [laughs] Sure.<eos> So, you know, Spencer Cavanaugh never did come back.<eos> Yeah, you said you saw him with Lizzie, is that right?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's not unusual for someone to skip out on a bill.<eos> You think he skipped out?<eos> Don't think that every time a sparrow dies, Lizzie Borden is to blame.<eos> You said that you grew up with her.<eos> Yeah, I did.
That's all I know.<eos> Is she all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, she had a couple of rough nights on the row, but she'll be okay.<eos> Who's coming to the party?<eos> Oh, none of these people.<eos> They've declined.<eos> And these are the only replies we've received for a party that begins in less than six hours.<eos> No one wants this.<eos> - I do.
Hence me having offered you the job, which you rejected.<eos> Wasn't personal. I just prefer freelance.<eos> No ties.<eos> So you said, with an impressive string of expletives.<eos> Okay, is being drunk an excuse?<eos> You know, it's really about professionalism.<eos> You are erratic and you are volatile.<eos> Effective.<eos> You've brought me eight jobs no one could deliver on.<eos> I did.
He says that you attacked him.<eos> Maybe I should call my lawyer first.<eos> Ma'am, I know who you are.<eos> And you should know that if I have to come back here with an arrest warrant, then the chances are this whole business ends up on the news.<eos> Which I'm sure that you're used to, but it wouldn't be my first choice.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I'm sorry, Officer...<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Shit.<eos> Go home.<eos> Bandage yourself up.<eos> Forget this ever happened.<eos> No. No, no, no. Just tell me what the hell happened.<eos> Okay, why did I try to kill myself?<eos> Or why did I try and kill...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I killed...<eos> No. No, you didn't.
It knocks people out.<eos> This is what made you think that you killed Trish.<eos> You know, I've spent my whole life protecting people.<eos> You're still you.<eos> You just need time to...<eos> I did things in the line of duty, horrible things, but I have never wanted to kill an innocent woman.<eos> Do you want to kill her now?<eos> - No.<eos> God, no.<eos> - No, because you never did.
- More important than a paying customer?<eos> Life and death, actually.<eos> Figured you were blowing me off.<eos> I wouldn't just bail on you.<eos> You've done it before.<eos> I don't even know what the hell I'm looking for.<eos> Anything that points to where Antoine might've gone.<eos> Airline receipts, train schedules.<eos> Won't find any of that if someone grabbed him.<eos> No one did.
How would I do that?<eos> You would have to stay with him, giving up your life as Trish Walker, living with him.<eos> - You mean have sex with him.<eos> - No, not that, but you'd have to be with him and point him in the right direction.<eos> Would I have any guarantee that he wouldn't use his abilities on me?<eos> None.<eos> But you could potentially change the world.<eos> What would you do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Do not presume to know!<eos> Before I met you, I got... everything I wanted.<eos> And I didn't... realize... how unsatisfactory that was until you left me to die.<eos> You are the first thing, excuse me, person... I ever wanted that walked away from me.<eos> You made me feel something I had never felt before.<eos> Yearning.<eos> I actually missed you.<eos> Well, I'm here now.<eos> You've got me.<eos> No, I don't.
Don't do that, either.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Uh-huh. Here you go.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> The cart on 41st Street has pastrami fries.<eos> I need you to witness something.<eos> I don't like what I see when you're around.<eos> Oh, you mean that room full of cops that put their own Glocks to their heads?<eos> I don't know what that was about.<eos> I do.
We've been waiting for you.<eos> "We"?<eos> The folks with the nooses around their necks.<eos> They want a plan, or at least some news.<eos> Well, they're gonna have to keep waiting.<eos> Come on, I... I gotta tell them something.<eos> We're meeting tonight.<eos> Tell them to forget it ever happened.<eos> You asked them to lie, to let you handle it.<eos> They did.
Well, take a bloody number.<eos> Did Jessica tell you to do this?<eos> No.<eos> I followed her here, thought she might lead me to you.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Just great.<eos> Get in the sodding car.<eos> Go on.<eos> I didn't kill your silly wife.<eos> Jessica did.
Clearly not, or you wouldn't have walked all the way over here.<eos> Look... it's not gonna change how you find or kill Kilgrave.<eos> - But it's important.<eos> - Yes, and private.<eos> So if you didn't have company, then...<eos> Ugh! It's not like you're interrupting some romantic interlude.<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause people are dying.<eos> Look, he obviously has feelings for you, and you definitely have feelings for him.<eos> I do not.
You help people.<eos> That's who you are.<eos> And you make the rest of us look like selfish pricks.<eos> Is that a compliment or...<eos> There are other nurses at the hospital who can help.<eos> There's only one that can help Luke.<eos> I just don't want him to wake up alone, not knowing what's happening.<eos> I don't even know what's happening.<eos> It's asking a lot, and you don't know me, but...<eos> Sure I do.
Yeah, I...<eos> I grew up.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> Look, I lied back then when I said I joined Yearbook for the hot teacher.<eos> I joined for you.<eos> - What?<eos> - Totally.<eos> I mean, I had the hugest crush on you.<eos> - You did not.<eos> - I did. I did.
If Milhouse can play, anyone can play.<eos> Once again, I'm the lower bound.<eos> You're it!<eos> Is that a grown man going between the children's legs?<eos> Well, there's nothing in the rule book against it.<eos> It's on page one of the rule book!<eos> That's where I doodle.<eos> It's a comic strip I do called Bumble and Grumble.<eos> Grumble likes to yell, but deep down he loves Bumble like a son.<eos> No, he doesn't.
If you want to know what his visions are, then you need him alive just as much as we do.<eos> Do I?<eos> I'll give you till the count of ten.<eos> - One... - It's a mistake.<eos> Don't listen to him.<eos> - Two...<eos> - What choice do we have?<eos> - Three...<eos> - How do we know this isn't just a lie? - Four...<eos> - We don't.
To Smart Rain.<eos> To Smart Rain.<eos> Do you mind if I record this?<eos> Um... no, no.<eos> So it was a really nice party your company held today.<eos> Uh, thank you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah, Smart Rain's been in development for... for seven years, so... It's by far the biggest project we've ever done.<eos> And the company... It started as a-a family business, is that right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, it did.
He's taking the company public tomorrow.<eos> Uh, timed out with the launch of Smart Rain.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> From family farm to Fortune 500.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sometimes I... miss the family part of it.<eos> You know... enough about me.<eos> What about you?<eos> Do you... do you have any, uh, any family?<eos> I do.
I guess he thought that Vincent was more right for the job, so...<eos> But, you know, I mean, it's like Vincent, he's always had this way of charming my dad.<eos> I-I can never match that.<eos> That must've been tough for you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, I was... I was the good student.<eos> I was the straight As, the valedictorian, and Vincent, he just has this charisma, so then my dad pays all this attention to him.<eos> It's always the same, you know?<eos> I'd come up with the ideas for the farm and then Vincent takes credit for it.<eos> Still does.
Let me guess.<eos> Vincent loves a quick score.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So... it made things difficult.<eos> Now, we don't often see eye to eye on certain projects.<eos> Like Smart Rain?<eos> Yeah, exactly like Smart Rain.<eos> And when it destroys farms after Vincent launches it, he'll make sure I get all the blame.<eos> I get it.<eos> Really, I do.
I don't know what happened then, but I was panicked and scared, and when I suddenly came to, it seemed like I was being attacked by a stranger.<eos> Then I felt a power surge from my body.<eos> Sir, I need you to remain...<eos> They grounded the flight in Houston, then took me in for questioning.<eos> I couldn't explain anything, but they had no proof.<eos> My lawyer believed I would be released.<eos> Then orders from the Defense Department arrived, and I ended up in this hell hole.<eos> Defense Secretary Richards has to be the one who's behind this.<eos> You believe I'm innocent?<eos> Yes, I do.
"I left the back door open so my buddy could drop off that dime bag he owed me."<eos> Look, I-I-I don't know why the door was open.<eos> It just was. I don't know George's day-to-day.<eos> I was just glad that the a/c was working.<eos> You said you hadn't talked to George in a long time.<eos> I did... say that.<eos> It had been a while.<eos> Too long, obviously.<eos> Look, we hunkered in, and we kicked back a couple of beers, waited for George to mosey on home.<eos> But he never did.
Look, I-I-I don't know why the door was open.<eos> It just was.

"George ain't coming," just out of the blue.<eos> Now we all know where George was.<eos> Where was that?<eos> Carl...<eos> If you're trying to catch me on something, it ain't gonna happen.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> I'm just trying to piece together what occurred... What you saw, what you were thinking, that kind of thing.<eos> I understand.<eos> It just gets a little confusing sometimes.<eos> Of course. These things always do.
You won't find it so easy passing your bill through the House of Lords.<eos> Thomas More and the old aristocracy are for the Pope and not afraid to say so.<eos> Well, we'll see. Archbishop Warham.<eos> This um, prophetess you harbour in your diocese - Eliza Barton?<eos> How is she getting on?<eos> What do you want, Cromwell?<eos> Well, I hear that she's telling people that if the King marries Lady Anne, he has only a year to reign.<eos> I just wondered who is controlling her.<eos> She may be a simple country girl but she has a genuine gift.<eos> She does, doesn't she?
Maybe they think you got potential.<eos> On the TV, they say that science is dying.<eos> I don't want it to die.<eos> So, what do you wanna do about that?<eos> Well, I wanna be the first person to visit their planet.<eos> Then that is what you'll do.<eos> Who knows why they chose 15 years? But things have gotten a whole lot better.<eos> I got a place at MIT, graduated. I got a job in astrophysics.<eos> Mom got clean and looked younger than ever before.<eos> In fact, everyone did.
Why would Korbell order a hit after an unsuccessful raid?<eos> I mean, it just calls more attention to him.<eos> Exactly.<eos> The animal that escapes a snare doesn't necessarily go after the poacher.<eos> Okay, everyone, we can ask these questions in San Antonio.<eos> So, saddle up.<eos> What does this guy Peterson have on you?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Because you're acting like he has something on you.<eos> He doesn't.
So do I.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I have good reason to believe that Simon has been skimming from the clubs, hiding assets.<eos> And I don't have proof yet, but I know he's working with an outside company, Ravenna.<eos> Ravenna?<eos> That sick bastard.<eos> What is it?<eos> Our daughter's name.<eos> I didn't know you had kids.<eos> We don't.
And soon I will have it.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Withered by age and failure, yet your blind optimism carries you on.<eos> Don't tell me you still cling to your belief in the Supreme Being?<eos> - You should fear his wrath.<eos> - Your "Being" doesn't exist.<eos> Realized that when I was 10 years old.<eos> Prayed for him to heal me.<eos> He never answered.<eos> Yes, he did.
Yes?<eos> Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?<eos> Do you feel it?<eos> Do you feel it all?<eos> Feel what?<eos> You don't feel it.<eos> Your consciousness is too small to comprehend it.<eos> I feel the emptiness of messages bombarding me, telling me to consume.<eos> I feel like there's something lacking in my life, and I feel like you might have the answer.<eos> I do.

Maybe I should just leave?<eos> Even for you, we have tasks.<eos> - I bet.<eos> With the Autobahn, for example.<eos> They need people for the toll booths.<eos> Or in construction. - Yes.<eos> You have to stay Hitler?<eos> - Yes, so I can get things done.<eos> So you don't have any Hitler-free moments?<eos> No, no, I do not.
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> He loves you and misses you more than life itself.<eos> He thinks about you every moment of every dying day.<eos> He thinks about how you met at Colonel White High School.<eos> He's saying something about your hair.<eos> Does that mean anything to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he always liked it long.<eos> He still does.
You did all this for me?<eos> Why wouldn't I?<eos> We're in this together, aren't we?<eos> How do you mean that?<eos> Simmer down.<eos> I have my own bedroom.<eos> Well, this is all very beautiful, but when do we get serious?<eos> Don't make the mistake of thinking we're not.<eos> We did not come all this way again to go back empty-handed.<eos> No, we did not.
What did they say?<eos> Not much.<eos> They said they'll review my request.<eos> I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't have asked that.<eos> I guess we're gonna find out.<eos> Looks like our vics were living pretty much off the grid:<eos> no bank accounts, no tax returns.<eos> Can't find a vehicle registration or driver's license for either one.<eos> Sounds like people who don't want to be found to me.<eos> Well, except the bounty hunter did.

Gordon. Get him down here.<eos> My husband's name is Mike.<eos> Mike?<eos> Okay. I got that, yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> The dog's tag says Mr. Bojangles?<eos> Like the song? Yeah.<eos> But he responds to Jangles.<eos> So they knew him.<eos> Well, the husband did, Mr. Ryan.
You gotta narrow it down.<eos> Hey, give me a break. Don't you think I'm trying?<eos> I don't have the processing capacity to do it here, and I can't very well sneak off to the university towing bodyguards.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry, man.<eos> I'm just... I'm frustrated, and I'm hungry, and I'm cold.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait, doesn't the hospital have supercomputers?<eos> Yeah, they do.
I know.<eos> Might explain why we keep getting away from him.<eos> CATHERINE: Why would whoever's behind this want us back alive?<eos> VINCENT: I don't know, but whatever the reason is, I think he knows it's a trap.<eos> Look, maybe we should just head back, right?<eos> No, he's still following us.<eos> We stick to the plan.<eos> At least we know he's after us and not our friends.<eos> Till death do us part, right?<eos> Yeah, till death do us part.
Pushed the nervous system too far, caused a painful overdose.<eos> Please, don't.<eos> lam telling you the truth.<eos> In a city of 8 million people, you zeroed in on my test subjects by chance?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> DHS knew about your experiments long before we did.<eos> We were just helping them.<eos> - DHS hired a beast?<eos> Really?<eos> - Yes, they did.
Well, it's a good thing we didn't elope, then, right?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> My parents, they didn't romanticize their wedding the way yours did.<eos> Oh, well, you know, everybody's different, you know?<eos> Doesn't mean they didn't love each other.<eos> No, I know.<eos> It wasn't until it hit me that we might not get a real wedding that I realised that I might want one.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
When you're done for the night.<eos> - May I know what about?<eos> - I'll tell you then.<eos> It's nothing bad.<eos> At least...<eos> No, I'll tell you then.<eos> I don't think Mr Molesley meant to be unkind about Miss Marigold.<eos> I'm sure he didn't.<eos> Only, it seemed to put you in a strange mood.<eos> Did it?
A full marriage.<eos> As opposed to...?<eos> Living together in companionship, I suppose.<eos> In friendship.<eos> Warm friendship, I'm sure.<eos> Is that what she's offering?<eos> Warm friendship?<eos> She has to know what you expect.<eos> Ever think of a time when we're told the whole Mr Green business is over?<eos> - Of course I do.
- Enough.<eos> I find I'm most disappointed in Tony Gillingham.<eos> Don't be.<eos> He wanted us to get married.<eos> Our week in sin was just part of his plan to persuade me.<eos> Then why did you say no?<eos> Because, when it came to it, he wasn't right.<eos> At least, not for me.<eos> And you didn't think of George?<eos> Of course I did.
Say I forgive her. Wish her luck.<eos> What will they do now?<eos> She'll serve time for manslaughter.<eos> She won't hang.<eos> So Mr Green goes on ruining lives.<eos> But not your life.<eos> Not any more.<eos> I'm sorry for what we've put you through, Mrs Bates.<eos> I probably shouldn't say it, but I am.<eos> You did no more than your duty, Sergeant Willis.
Hey, Jamie. This is a nice surprise.<eos> I have something for you.<eos> [ sighs ] Seriously?<eos> Yes.<eos> Get in here.<eos> - You. - You.<eos> Come on. Open it. Open it.<eos> Open it.<eos> You really didn't need to do this.<eos> Yes, I did.
Well, Henry, why didn't you tell me he was back?<eos> I needed to find out why he had returned, what he wanted.<eos> It seems he wants to make amends of sorts.<eos> He mentioned you, that he had no intention of harming you because of what you'd been through...<eos> What you'd both been through.<eos> That's why he said he was an expert.<eos> It's hard to believe that Adam is capable of a kind gesture, but I believe that ledger is his way of apologizing.<eos> But that doesn't change what he did to me.<eos> And God knows what he's done to others. No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
But follow their lead.<eos> You got greedy, Chappy.<eos> You got greedy, and you killed Rick for that gold.<eos> That's not true.<eos> He was gonna split it with us.<eos> You don't have to split anything if you steal it.<eos> You know, I could see a big guy like you handling a harpoon.<eos> Why would I kill him?<eos> Rick was the only one that knew where the gold was.<eos> Now nobody does.
You can ask my assistant.<eos> This one?<eos> [ chuckles ] Great.<eos> This is how it is now?<eos> Does no one have any damn privacy anymore?<eos> I know that hero doctor.<eos> [ sighs ] this really wasn't necessary.<eos> Henry, you saved the life of a little boy.<eos> I thought it was heroic.<eos> And clearly, the newspaper did, too.
No, no, it's okay. I can't stop thinking about Sarah, either.<eos> Detective Martinez, my partner, made me promise that I wouldn't talk about any murders on our date.<eos> Oh, is that what this is?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh-huh. I'm not up on all of the latest rituals... But be aware, you're currently being courted.<eos> Duly noted.<eos> Here's to fate bringing us back together and justice served.<eos> I'm not quite sure that's the case.<eos> What do you mean? I thought you had a confession.<eos> We do, but...
They've just had a recent outbreak of dysentery.<eos> No, um, Isaac wants to take me on vacation.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, he doesn't waste any time, does he?<eos> Yeah, I think he's getting impatient with me.<eos> Having trouble narrowing down a place?<eos> No, it's just, things are...<eos> Well, they're moving so fast.<eos> And... you're afraid you don't like him?<eos> No, I-I-I'm afraid that I do.
-Hey!<eos> You want a ride?<eos> -No, I'll see you over there.<eos> -See her where?<eos> -Oh, she invited me to some tribal dance thing.<eos> -We move out at 2200 hours.<eos> I suggest you grab some chow and get some rack time.<eos> -Wait.<eos> Are you giving me a curfew?<eos> I don't do curfews, Pops.
Your family's been drugging you.<eos> I think the question is, why?<eos> What do they have to gain by you seeming crazy?<eos> As long as I'm incapacitated, Mother controls the inheritance that Daddy left me.<eos> See, she already burned through hers financing Lyman's campaign.<eos> Oh, and to think Lyman chose mental health funding as his platform.<eos> Oh, no, but we don't know he's involved.<eos> - Even the simplest implication would derail his career.<eos> This could've killed you, Louise.<eos> But it didn't.
What is this?<eos> I'm so sorry. After everything you've done for me...<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Nolan's house. Victoria asked me to find it for her.<eos> And in the state I was in, I just wasn't thinkin' clearly.<eos> Yeah, but... But I've never seen this before.<eos> It was in the kitchen in that folder.<eos> Kate's folio.<eos> Look, I don't even know what it means.<eos> I do.
Come on.<eos> This is insane.<eos> I didn't rape Jess, I didn't put that in her sink, and I haven't seen that jacket since the day in the woods.<eos> I know, Mr. Crawford.<eos> What do you know?<eos> I know all about Jess Murphy.<eos> I know you didn't have the jacket.<eos> And I know you didn't kill Tom.<eos> You know?<eos> I do.
It's, uh, 9:27.<eos> Hi, Sandra, also.<eos> And Arthur, I guess.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, Stan.<eos> I need to see Sandra.<eos> Of course.<eos> I thought he was gonna pull the trigger.<eos> And when he didn't...
Maybe that's what he was talking about.<eos> All right, all right. Did you see anything else?<eos> Yeah. Molly Walker was there.<eos> - Molly Walker?<eos> - And another thing.<eos> The footage kept skipping back and forth as if someone was manipulating time.<eos> I only know one person who can do that.<eos> Hiro Nakamura.<eos> Guess you don't remember talking to him either?<eos> No, I don't.
Although Molly's download was incomplete, the EPIC units are still useful.<eos> Our operatives are using them now, and they've been distributed to law enforcement.<eos> Great.<eos> The technology I've spent a year and billions of dollars developing is only a partial success.<eos> We can just arrest them all for trespassing.<eos> It'll be easy to isolate them with the EPIC.<eos> No, these are our customers, and every single one of them has a cell phone with a camera.<eos> We spoil their fun, it goes viral in an instant.<eos> You do want the girl, though.<eos> I do.
You stay away from her!<eos> It's okay, daddy.<eos> He's gone now.<eos> Okay. What did he want?<eos> He said that he'd forgive us for everything we've done if... If I help him make a new friend.<eos> Okay, what... what... what friend, honey?<eos> Did he... did he say who it is?<eos> No. You said not to talk to him anymore.<eos> - Good.<eos> - So I didn't.
Best is the enemy of good, luv.<eos> This, this is a good plan.<eos> Here we go.<eos> All right, let's get you up here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Black veins.<eos> That's her.<eos> We need to get closer.<eos> Of course you do.
That's what I wanted to ask you.<eos> How do you mean?<eos> I don't like it when my teammates get hit.<eos> Same goes for my coach.<eos> Thank you, Tony.<eos> I think I'm gonna get hit no matter what I do.<eos> I got some tough decisions to make.<eos> You once told me that winning solves everything.<eos> I don't know if I believe that anymore.<eos> They do.
It's Rockville High Graduation Night, 2009.<eos> - I swear.<eos> - Anna?<eos> Who is Anna?<eos> Hi, everybody, or, you know, the three people that actually watch my stupid vlogs.<eos> Mom, Dad, Uncle Keith's ghost, tonight is graduation night.<eos> I can't believe it's really her.<eos> She's getting ready for the graduation party.<eos> Anthony, we need to talk.<eos> Shh. No, we don't.
Uh, a body, and a face, for starters.<eos> Sincerely, Anna Reed.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Uh, Uncle Keith's ghost.<eos> - Uncle Keith?<eos> - We have to go now!<eos> You are never going to find your video.<eos> It is no wonder that Ian does not value your friendship.<eos> Of course he does. Oh, really?
Damn, I've never done it in the top rope, that's why I'm having a hard time with that.<eos> - All right, here we go. - And...<eos> - Oh!<eos> I'm giving birth! - Aah!<eos> - I'm giving birth!<eos> That was really early.<eos> Who's gonna watch me enslave all these cute, adorable, fuzzy creaters?<eos> I said "creaters." What's a creater?<eos> Cut.<eos> Just do the other guy's line... do Ian's line?
You know who he's gonna believe?<eos> Me when I tell him what you really did.<eos> If you were gonna do it, you would have done it.<eos> And I would be dead, I guess.<eos> We've loved each other, Sadie.<eos> I still love you.<eos> What happened? What did I do?<eos> [Sadie] Nothing.<eos> It doesn't have to be this way with us, with any of us.<eos> - Yes, it does.
Your son's a hero.<eos> Your son is a traitor.<eos> - History will determine that.<eos> - No, sir. [Halpert] Court-Martial will.<eos> Please, just... just... Please.<eos> [quietly] Why?<eos> Everything I know we're doing over there, that we're not supposed to be doing, that they're lying about, you have no idea.<eos> Even Shafe.<eos> Soldiers need to know the war we're fighting.<eos> We all do.
And you may have to work pretty hard, but it will free us from this lawsuit.<eos> Are you saying, "work will set you free"?<eos> Yes.<eos> They have the manpower. We have the perseverance.<eos> Triumph of the will.<eos> He's the most cheerful person I've ever heard quote Hitler.<eos> So Hooli's entire intellectual property claim boils down to three simple questions.<eos> Did your work on Pied Piper at any time overlap with your scope of work or Hooli business?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Did you ever do work on Pied Piper on Hooli time?
And eventually his friends left, and it was just me and him.<eos> And that's when it happened.<eos> She, of course, said, "No."<eos> You know, trying' to keep him from doing' what he was doing'.<eos> And then he eventually just forced her and... and raped her.<eos> Lieutenant Cottrell interviewed all the people that, you know, I had known that were involved.<eos> In my opinion, I had a conspiracy of not only the suspect that was involved in... in raping the victim, but I also had friends of his that helped convince her that there was a party that she was going to.<eos> The university had their judicial hearing.<eos> I had this idealistic view that if I was telling the truth that they would support me.<eos> And, um... they didn't.
I'm gonna do one more, a little something here to cool down.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> Really?<eos> She got to you too?<eos> You know, I always wondered why no one ever really thought through this whole "one of us, one of them" thing.<eos> I mean, think about it.<eos> Any Evo who turns on his own, can you ever really trust them?<eos> I trusted you.<eos> And I liked you, Noah.<eos> I still do.
No security.<eos> The only thing I could find was sewage pipes.<eos> Attack them from underneath.<eos> Yeah, it could work.<eos> There has to be another way.<eos> Maybe you should've stolen a blueprints from that sociopath mother of yours, since she runs the place.<eos> Your mother is using Micah and his powers to-- to control every single bit of information out there.<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> So, unless you have a better way to break in, that is the plan.<eos> I do.

I'm making up for lost time.<eos> My grandmother never allowed candy, even on movie night.<eos> It sounds weird, but... it was the one time where I actually felt connected.<eos> Beyond the walls.<eos> Well, I don't think that sounds weird.<eos> My wife and I, we used to love taking our son, Dennis, to the movies.<eos> Popcorn, candy, the whole shebang, just to help him feel like a regular kid.<eos> And did he?<eos> Feel like a regular kid?<eos> He did.
Oh, Marianne.<eos> You're... You're a unique girl.<eos> And Roland may have a few flaws...<eos> Understatement.<eos> But he still loves you.<eos> -He loves the crown. -But...<eos> -And his hair.<eos> -But... -Not in that order.<eos> -But if not Roland, then there has to be someone else!<eos> No, there doesn't.
This is the Balkans, you may get fucked here!<eos> Go or I'll bust your head open.<eos> Hit me, kill me, do whatever you want.<eos> It's all the same for me.<eos> I'll say I got him, but he ran away somewhere in Bulgaria.<eos> Want to go back?<eos> You have to walk.<eos> I can't take you back. I have to go home.<eos> If you want to come; welcome.<eos> If you don't; God speed.
His mother should be worried.<eos> Did you call his mother?<eos> Did you call your mother?<eos> She should be worried.<eos> She wouldn't. It's alright.<eos> - Why did you do this, son?<eos> - Is it my fault now, mother?<eos> Father told me to bring him.<eos> Don't you know father?<eos> I sure do.
No.<eos> Ferrous Corp doesn't care about their men.<eos> They'll just get more.<eos> Ships, on the other hand, are a lot harder to come by.<eos> And a hell of a lot more expensive.<eos> You saying we take out their ship?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Well, I like the idea in theory, but it begs the question... how do we get it down here?<eos> We don't.
Wouldn't trust them to keep a kite airborne.<eos> Were you a pilot before you retired, Mr Greaves?<eos> Uh, no. No.<eos> I'm just happy to be part of it these days.<eos> But once flying is in your blood, that's it. Nothing like it.<eos> Up above the clouds, sun shining.<eos> Like being in heaven.<eos> I'm sure it is.<eos> The papers practically accuse the mechanics union of sabotaging that plane.<eos> Well, somebody did.
~ Is Ned a member too?<eos> And you?<eos> Wouldn't let me.<eos> Said one of us going bad was enough.<eos> And when was the last time you saw Badger alive?<eos> Two days ago, just before Ned disappeared.<eos> Dot, I think you need to take Paddy outside.<eos> Sorry, Dr Harcourt, all the excitement's got to Lady Granville.<eos> She's had one of her turns and needs your attention.<eos> Course she does.
Which means the skin for his operations came from somewhere...<eos> Or someone else.<eos> These aren't wounds from a knife fight, are they, Dr Harcourt?<eos> You were using Jimmy and Badger as your guinea pigs.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Men like Archie, they need skin from other donors, and I paid the boys, I paid them well.<eos> They knew what they were doing.<eos> It was perfectly safe!<eos> But Jimmy didn't take the sulphur like I told him.<eos> No, he didn't.
I just need to finish packing.<eos> Wait downstairs?<eos> Milady.<eos> My Lord.<eos> I call.<eos> Three jacks.<eos> Shall we keep playing?<eos> I, um... .. I seem to be low on funds.<eos> But you hold an IOU signed by my father.<eos> Yes, I do.
He's not saying much at all, given that he's unconscious and may not survive.<eos> He's at the Royal Melbourne Hospital under police guard.<eos> It's the same man I saw you arguing with during the war, isn't he?<eos> In Norfolk House, in 1916.<eos> I don't know who you think you saw so long ago.<eos> Please, for once in your life, will you tell me the truth?<eos> Yes, it could be him.<eos> But he was crazy, shell-shocked.<eos> Turned up out of the blue and claimed I owed him money from a card game.<eos> ~ And did you?
I don't own much.<eos> I like to keep it safe.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> Just admiring the cut of your jib.<eos> (Laughs) Mind if I do the same?<eos> Oooh, is this a private party?<eos> I'm missing all the fun.<eos> I might go and find myself a drink.<eos> Say, did I mention that Jack and me had a swell talk this afternoon?<eos> No, you didn't.
It's possible.<eos> She carries this brew around with her everywhere.<eos> Someone might have slipped something into it.<eos> Let's ask Dr Mac to test it.<eos> If Constance is being poisoned, perhaps she was the target all along.<eos> The killer didn't succeed the first time and they're trying again.<eos> If that's the case, why the payments to Belinda?<eos> That was a red herring.<eos> Constance swears she didn't pay her.<eos> Somebody did.
If she came and said hi, then I'd have so much to say...<eos> - ...but she doesn't.<eos> Move back. I'm a doctor.<eos> We lost the patient.<eos> My condolences.<eos> My condolences.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Yes?<eos> We have a school magazine.<eos> Maybe you do.
It's family business.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> She working with Beretti.<eos> Yeah, while you up in here planning weddings, this bitch planning how to steal everything you got... Which is everything I got... And I'm not finna let that happen.<eos> Tell him, boo boo kitty.<eos> - I'm... she-she...<eos> - Oh-oh, ah-ah, she-she, buh-buh-buh-buh.<eos> Oh, now you can't speak English?<eos> Yes, she did, Lucious. And she tried to take Porsha.<eos> Sho' did.
Would you?<eos> Let's take one more peek and make sure that that sucker's still in there.<eos> Yep.<eos> Why don't I read you a book?<eos> Which one do you want?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> You don't want a story, Tom?<eos> Those boys don't have daddies, either.<eos> You know, your daddy loves you very much.<eos> No, he does not.

Hey, everything's gonna be all right.<eos> Listen, what I'm gonna do is, we're gonna clear out of this room, get a nice meal brought in here. If you're still feeling bad this afternoon, we'll call a doctor, okay?<eos> Okay, so I'm assuming that you've all seen and heard the mess that your fellow prisoner has created for us this afternoon.<eos> So I want you all to say now, after me,<eos> "Prisoner 819 did a bad thing."<eos> Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.<eos> Okay, that's great, but I said loudly enough so that he can hear you.<eos> 20 times.<eos> Let's go. Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.<eos> Prisoner 819 did a bad thing.

He stole 282 million dollars from Baghdad in the middle of Operation Shock and Awe abducted a CIA asset out of Iran during the '09 election protests.<eos> Later, he sold his secrets to Beijing.<eos> The CIA announced his death two months ago.<eos> We say that about a lot of inmates at The Factory.<eos> Truth is Braxton's being interrogated for secrets he stole from the Chinese, from the Iranians, us.<eos> RESSLER: My money's on the fact these two have a history.<eos> Reddington, Braxton, they're planning something.<eos> Whatever it is, you'll find out.<eos> - Oh, we don't have authorization.<eos> - You do now.
I'd always assumed he'd succeeded that he was sipping some umbrella-clad cocktail on a beach in Tahiti until five years later during a remodel of the Fitzwilliam, they removed a wall.<eos> There was poor Bruno-- What was left of him, anyway.<eos> --Stuck inside a heating duct, still clutching that vase.<eos> I prefer to think of old Bruno on that beach in Tahiti.<eos> GERNET: We have a problem.<eos> What?<eos> Our asset is tracking the extent of the breach.<eos> It appears that Braxton's team has penetrated your country's network.<eos> We have confirmation on what they're looking for?<eos> Yes, we do.
You keep doing that. That's the trick.<eos> That's how we control it.<eos> - Heath... - Wait, what if he can't close it?<eos> - I'll be able to.<eos> - Then we take them on.<eos> We take them on?<eos> If we get into trouble, we go behind the building into the woods and we draw them away.<eos> Hey, you've been out on runs since he got here.<eos> He knows what he's doing.<eos> Me and Aiden, we didn't.
How many more of us have to die before we do something?<eos> 'Cause pretty soon it's gonna be too late.<eos> Carter, you need to be really careful here.<eos> You're talking about us going to Deanna and telling her...<eos> No, I'm not talking about talking some more. About meetings. I'm not talking about that.<eos> Plain and simple, we kill him before he kills us.<eos> Hello.<eos> Carter.<eos> - He heard.<eos> - I didn't.
I stopped him.<eos> We have a good hour until we have 'em to green when we hand them off to Daryl, Sasha, and Abraham.<eos> Why don't you head back, tell everyone what's happening?<eos> - They should know.<eos> - Okay, Rick, I just...<eos> Will you do that for me?<eos> I'll take care of that one.<eos> Michonne, you take point.<eos> I know it's how it is.<eos> I do.

You killed Trippi, you were gonna run away with his crates, sell them for a fortune, and never look back.<eos> Run away to where?<eos> My whole life is this river.<eos> Rich fugitives don't need rivers.<eos> They sip mimosas and get massages by infinity pools.<eos> I don't care about that! I just want to do my job!<eos> Wow, you really do love the river.<eos> Yes! Are you deaf?<eos> But Trippi knew the sommelier didn't want an extra case of wine, so why did he order another one from the brothers?<eos> He didn't.
Don't worry.<eos> Pretty sure... it's not loaded.<eos> Finch, get out on your... Balcony. Now.<eos> (Finch) Don't.<eos> Please.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do, or someone else will get hurt.<eos> Someone whose life still matters.<eos> No, your life matters. No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Yeah.<eos> Except you could have been a guest at our wedding.<eos> Oh, you... you guys are married?<eos> - I mean...<eos> - Yup. Tied the knot.<eos> Well, wait, you've known each other, like, a week, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Wow. Yeah.<eos> You guys don't mess around.<eos> Yes, we do.
Oh, don't even worry about it.<eos> I don't care about that thing.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Now, if had been my old<eos> VW Bug, we would've had a problem.<eos> Wait, you used to have a VW Bug?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I used to have a VW Bug!<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
I don't.<eos> You scared of being seen with me by your mates at the station?<eos> Well, I don't think any of the blokes I work with have ever been to a place without a big screen TV.<eos> Um, so where do you live, then?<eos> Bankstown.<eos> With my parents.<eos> My mum needs help looking after my dad.<eos> They like what you do?<eos> Not really.<eos> Well, I do.
You don't need to worry about me, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Good night, Alan.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> This episode you had... was very traumatic, I know, but it's no excuse.<eos> We counsel hope, not fire and brimstone.<eos> I have a new message.<eos> What you're saying could bring us down.<eos> -This has nothing to do with you.<eos> -The hell it doesn't.
No.<eos> - We will contact you if necessary.<eos> - Okay. Bye.<eos> We need to be sure to get a drawing of the nurse.<eos> Did you see?<eos> Someone filming us from the window.<eos> - Police!<eos> - You can not be here!<eos> - Why shoot us?<eos> - I did not.
Arne, we take with us the stuff.<eos> How are you, darling?<eos> I've been calling you.<eos> Sophia is dead.<eos> They murdered her.<eos> He asked for her.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The cops took me in.<eos> They showed photos of Sofia.<eos> - What did you do?
Your marvel of science.<eos> No, this is the spot.<eos> There's energy in the air.<eos> The power of nature in the clouds.<eos> The device we built will gather that force, focus it... ..and then rain it down on what attracts it most.<eos> We must draw the Ottoman forces here.<eos> As many as we can.<eos> And then pray that those remaining will surrender once they see the power of our weapon.<eos> Did you just say "pray", Da Vinci?<eos> Indeed I did.

Please, please.<eos> All right.<eos> Come on. No! No!<eos> No! Breakfast of champions.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> Do you really need to be so aggressive?<eos> Can't you have some compassion?<eos> You get the hell out of here.<eos> You don't give a shit about these girls.<eos> And you do?
Mom!<eos> Mom!<eos> Mom?<eos> It's been confirmed that the disease is accelerating in Pretty Lake as the death toll mounts to over 300.<eos> There has been a frustrating lack of new information.<eos> The Department of Public Health has not issued any updates in the past week, though rumors have been swirling that a vaccine might be ready in the next few days.<eos> Eternal God, God of our mothers and our fathers, our God, we come before you today not in sadness or despair, but in joy and in confirmation. We come affirming...<eos> Stop it!<eos> We need to pray.<eos> No, we don't, Melissa.
Nothing.<eos> They think I killed Lana.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> And you didn't warn me?<eos> After I found it, it was too late to text you and...<eos> Okay, well, I didn't do it, okay?<eos> You're my alibi.<eos> How?<eos> You know damn well why I didn't go and meet her.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately, I do.
- Ronnie, stop it!<eos> - You're not better than me!<eos> Stop.<eos> Just lay down.<eos> - No!<eos> No! - Okay?<eos> - I know you want to.<eos> - No! - I know you do.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Do it.
I honestly didn't think he was wired that way.<eos> I was never so sure.<eos> How's Wiley?<eos> About as good as you'd be after something like that.<eos> Jason.<eos> Rough day?<eos> Yeah, you can say that.<eos> Well, if it helps, I spoke to Ronnie.<eos> He's truly sorry.<eos> It doesn't.
I am supposed to be very careful. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> - But sometimes I'm not so careful.<eos> Like this morning, I left the front door open.<eos> You won't tell Chuck, will you?<eos> Chuck?<eos> Chuck's my brother.<eos> He says he's my father and mother, too, because they died.<eos> He makes me hamburgers whenever I want. I can't make them anymore.<eos> Do you have a brother?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You do?<eos> How?<eos> Come here.<eos> Do you still have the geo coordinates to the tunnel?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - We're less than ten minutes away.<eos> Then we'll get you out.<eos> What about you?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
Yeah, but I didn't know bauerschwein and blutbaden had this ancient feud.<eos> Doesn't justify what he did.<eos> I mean, Angelina did kill his brothers.<eos> Angelina?<eos> Yeah, Monroe's ex-girlfriend.<eos> That Angelina?<eos> She killed Orson's brothers?<eos> It was one of my first cases as a grimm.<eos> What the hell was I supposed to know?<eos> Well, more than I did.
I'm calling 'cause you screwed up.<eos> You said there would be nobody inside.<eos> You screwed up.<eos> We need to talk about how<eos> - you're going to fix this.<eos> - Me? You killed them.<eos> You hired me.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Now.<eos> No, we don't.
Is he home?<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> I'll get you out of this, I promise.<eos> Mr. Solloway, you have the right to remain silent. Do you believe me?<eos> _<eos> Fuck.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I thought you said that you were considering it.<eos> I did.
Sweetheart.<eos> Mom, why did you do it?<eos> I'm really sorry, honey.<eos> - Come here.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Hey, Mom.<eos> Mom, I can write my college essay on anything I want, right?<eos> Yes, I think so.<eos> Is that what it says?<eos> Yes, it does.
Julia Richmond.<eos> Sergeant.<eos> Service number... 25130581.<eos> All you have to do is tell me, Julia, what intel you have.<eos> What suspicion.<eos> If you do this for me, I will let you live.<eos> Do you have anything to live for?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm terribly sorry about that.<eos> No, wait.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You sent louie becker to spy on taylor?<eos> I wanted to prove she was sleeping around, But i never heard from him again. The next morning --<eos> His leg was on evelyn's lawn.<eos> Yeah. I can't see taylor chopping up a body And throwing the parts all over town.<eos> Yeah, it must've been her lover.<eos> But nobody knows who he is.<eos> Katy does.
His kids were admitted.<eos> Hello. This is O.R. 1.<eos> Did he tell Amelia?<eos> Did he pass off his cases?<eos> Well, I'm sure he did.<eos> Derek wouldn't just leave his patients.<eos> Pickups.<eos> Or his wife or his kids.<eos> I mean, it's... it's just hard to believe.<eos> Well, he did.
Don't do drugs in front of me.<eos> I don't want to talk to any of your little friends, and don't try and have sex with any of my friends.<eos> Anything else? No, that's it.<eos> Try and enjoy yourself.<eos> Yeah, like that's going to happen.<eos> Toby!<eos> Hey, Caroline.<eos> No-one knew if you were coming or not! Do you want a drink?<eos> I've got some ciders hidden in the washing machine.<eos> Course he does.
Find its location?<eos> It's my car, Anita.<eos> I want you to track it, please.<eos> The car is currently driving north on Brooks Street.<eos> It's noisy in here.<eos> Do you want to go outside and talk?<eos> I can hear OK.<eos> I mean, do you want to go somewhere? Just you and me.<eos> Just you and me?<eos> Erm, I do.
Lomis did.<eos> He sent it to us.<eos> He set us up to take the fall.<eos> You expect me to believe that?<eos> He didn't even show up...<eos> To collect his share of the take.<eos> Who passes up on that much money?<eos> I don't believe them.<eos> They know where Lomis is, they have to.<eos> No, they don't, Krumitz.
We talked to your school.<eos> The guidance counselor had these sketches on file that your art teacher had handed over.<eos> According to your school records, you've had a rough year.<eos> Anger issues.<eos> Verbal outbursts.<eos> At the time Everett was shot, your paintball team had just split up.<eos> Was there anyone who could account for you, just before the body was discovered?<eos> Make no mistake, Harris.<eos> We're gonna catch whoever did this.<eos> Not if I do first.
Yeah, pretty much.<eos> Yeah, you definitely need a better life.<eos> That's why I'm hanging out with you.<eos> Or maybe I should be working with your dad in the State Department.<eos> Yeah, think again.<eos> Do you even know what division he's in?<eos> Agriculture.<eos> It's so boring.<eos> He must know a lot about soil.<eos> Yeah, no, really, he does.
Yeah.<eos> It's about our legacy.<eos> It's about restoring manufacturing...<eos> Hey, where are you going?<eos> - I got to go.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> Sit down.<eos> Come on.<eos> - You don't want to hear the truth.<eos> - Please, I do.
Thank you for your generosity.<eos> I truly appreciate it.<eos> You mind?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I was wondering when we were gonna get a chance to talk.<eos> That lovely soul is one of pastor Tom's congregation.<eos> Poor fella.<eos> But she told me I could stay at his old church.<eos> She ask you to bring Tom back from the dead?<eos> She did, actually.
Why are you telling me this?<eos> Adrian wants you to come with us.<eos> Come with you?<eos> Adrian almost killed my father and he murdered all those people.<eos> Adrian's not a murderer!<eos> He was protecting you.<eos> Just like you protected him.<eos> It seems we don't have much time.<eos> If you stay they'll never believe you.<eos> They never do.
Where's mills and brett?<eos> - Oh, they're tied up.<eos> I mean, not literally, of course. Not anymore.<eos> - They're at chicago pd.<eos> What's the latest with terrance?<eos> Still on the machine.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hey, uh...<eos> You want to hear How dawson found brett and mills?<eos> - Yeah, yeah i do.
- on the schedule.<eos> - That's right.<eos> That is because I am never on the schedule.<eos> - Eldritch!<eos> - Herr Eichhorst.<eos> - State your business.<eos> - Your encounter with Setrakian.<eos> He was able to get way too close.<eos> That could've ended very badly for us.<eos> - But it didn't.
You look different.<eos> My dear, I believe I've gotten my second wind.<eos> I was just trying to get through to him.<eos> - Do you think it worked?<eos> - I do.<eos> But you'll never win with your son when it comes to his mother.<eos> It's that simple.<eos> Is he gonna die on us?<eos> There's less swelling, but he's fully infected.<eos> - In other words... we did it.
It doesn't matter, because he already knew.<eos> How can you know that?<eos> Because I know Louis and I know you.<eos> And he couldn't have broken you, unless he knew the truth already.<eos> So, this is not your fault, and I never want to hear you say that again.<eos> I should have at least warned you before you got here.<eos> All that would have done was antagonize him even more, because he would have known you did it.<eos> You did everything you could have done.<eos> We have to tell Mike.<eos> No, we don't.
You do still owe me that favor.<eos> What kind of math are you doing?<eos> The kind of math that says Jessica Pearson hiring Louis Litt back adds up to shady.<eos> If that's all you've got, you can collect your favor when the clock strikes kiss my ass, because partners leave firms and come back all the time.<eos> Maybe, but they don't come back with their name on the wall.<eos> I'm guessing he wasn't supposed to tell me that. But he did.<eos> And Louis Litt is not name partner material, which means he must have something on you.<eos> So, unless you want me going around town flapping my big mouth that something isn't right in your kitchen, you're going to make good on that favor.<eos> Sylvia didn't slip up at all, did she?<eos> No, she didn't.
That was a good one.<eos> That was a good one.<eos> Sounds just like me, baby girl.<eos> I had you fooled, huh?<eos> You did.<eos> I can't stand... Now, let me show you how a lawyer cooks.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I just thought you'd want this.<eos> The associates saved it for you.<eos> No, they didn't.
- Good to see you, Reg.<eos> - I know you don't mean that.<eos> Any friend of Vernon's a friend of mine.<eos> Yo, man, so what can I do for you?<eos> I need to talk to Vernon for a minute.<eos> He don't want no interruptions.<eos> But I hear you've been poaching.<eos> Spencer, baby.<eos> Miss Littlefield.<eos> - How you doing?
It was Cochise.<eos> Okay, I want you to try and stand up.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Well, I guess you won't be climbing any 30-foot walls anytime soon.<eos> But the fact that you're alive and not paralyzed is a hell of a lot more than okay.<eos> I've never gone behind your back, 'cause I trust you.<eos> And I thought you trusted me, too.<eos> I do. I...
That's good that he's leaving?<eos> That's good that you didn't have to see him 'cause he snuck over here during the middle of the day while you were at work?<eos> That's good that he has some new clothes, Janet.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> Did you ever ask Teddy about his part in all this?<eos> I asked Daniel.<eos> About Teddy's part?<eos> Yes.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He didn't, really.
He told me about George Melton and Daggett.<eos> He loves you... Jon.<eos> I'm really sorry that you have to go through this again, Danny.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I do.<eos> But not enough?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm not sure what enough is.<eos> I thought I loved someone once.<eos> Maybe you did.
Is Daniel here?<eos> No, he was gone when I woke up.<eos> Thought he was with you.<eos> No.<eos> Is everything okay, Melvin?<eos> Not so much.<eos> Come in, Melvin.<eos> You want some coffee, or...?<eos> They want him to leave.<eos> Who does?
That's not necessary.<eos> I'm paying you for this extra work, too.<eos> It won't take but a few hours.<eos> That's not even up for discussion.<eos> I did it, Melvin.<eos> What?<eos> The paint.<eos> The can... Just knocked it over.<eos> Well, these... These things happen.<eos> No, they don't.
Some of the tenants went over Melvin's head.<eos> You're not on the lease.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> When? Tonight.<eos> They don't like the color?<eos> Guess not.<eos> Sheriff Daggett doesn't think I killed George.<eos> Well, that's encouraging.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Especially since I didn't.
Well, memory loss... That's a sure sign of old age.<eos> So's losing your hearing.<eos> How about the old fishing pole?<eos> Still able to hook a fish with it?<eos> You know, I've been married for 28 years.<eos> I don't get the pole out as much as I used to.<eos> But I hear you do.<eos> I heard you pulled Katherine Hale into your boat.<eos> Why would you care about my relationship with Katherine Hale?<eos> Well, I don't.
- You got any kin waiting on you?<eos> No, sir, I don't.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> Well... What can I do for you, officer?<eos> You can give me a ride.<eos> - This the shitbag? - It is.<eos> - Hello, shitbag.<eos> - Him there's the good news.<eos> - I don't want to hear the bad news.<eos> - No, sir, you do not.
So, I'll bet my droid.<eos> You can't bet Chopper.<eos> He's...<eos> See?<eos> I can't lose.<eos> And you know we need the credits.<eos> Right.<eos> Do it.<eos> So, do we have a bet?<eos> We do.
Hera, is it?<eos> It is.<eos> And the Ghost can mask both its signal and signature.<eos> We'll get you past the blockade. What's the cargo?<eos> I was told, "No questions asked."<eos> That's fine.<eos> It just costs more.<eos> Kanan and I already settled on a price.<eos> But I assume he requires your approval.<eos> - He doesn't.
Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I deserved that.<eos> But can we get back to the job at hand, flying us past the Imperial blockade?<eos> Otherwise, I don't have to pay you or give your droid back.<eos> What was in that crate?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Calrissian said not to open it.<eos> Yes. He did.
Quite admirable.<eos> But what I want to know is about the other rebels, code name Fulcrum.<eos> I know nothing of a larger rebellion.<eos> And if I did, I'd rather give my life than tell you.<eos> So heroic.<eos> Just like your master.<eos> Tell me, Jedi, how did you survive Order 66?<eos> It was your Master Billaba who laid down her life for yours.<eos> Do you remember her last word to you, her last and final breath before she died?<eos> You do, don't you?
OK...<eos> I see why they call them Rat People<eos> - Who else would live down here?<eos> - There's not much choice without a Company job.<eos> They spend their whole lives down here.<eos> I don't see Alvis.<eos> - Alvis couldn't make it.<eos> He's... - I know where he is, Auntie.<eos> It still doesn't explain why I should trust you.<eos> Because Alvis does.
Shocker.<eos> Look, I know you probably want to grab some shut-eye before you gotta wipe down menus and marry ketchups, but I gotta talk to you.<eos> Screw you.<eos> If a guy lets you walk home at 3:00 am with your panties in your purse, you're not his girlfriend.<eos> The guy you thought was your meal ticket is really just a bang buddy.<eos> But cute townies always get screwed.<eos> Literally.<eos> Wait, I was gonna ask you something. Oh!<eos> There's a reporter at The Observer you talked to, Rebecca Hinton.<eos> No, I didn't.
This part of the cerebellum...<eos> it's been altered somehow, stimulated, almost like Drill is...<eos> - marking them. - Exactly.<eos> But for what?<eos> Wes, slow down. I don't understand. I'm at the hospital.<eos> Minx has the same thing Henry does.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> She have a fever?<eos> It's not just her.<eos> They all do.
They can be blunt and inappropriate.<eos> If they're... if they're keeping secrets, they let you know.<eos> How?<eos> They have tells, I mean, just like us, but with even less control over the whole mechanism.<eos> They... they fidget. Their eyes wander.<eos> And that's how we differentiate them from Drill.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Drill is not a child.<eos> He was able to possess Eliot Harcourt and fool the parents, but they didn't know what to look for.<eos> I do.
In the meantime, Ralph's being released back to you.<eos> Thank God.<eos> But he's my responsibility, so you need to stay close to me in case Eckherd wants him to come back in.<eos> Cabe, let me talk to them and clear this up.<eos> They're being extremely aggressive.<eos> The safe house intel in the game was stolen in a hack of the CIA mainframe three weeks ago.<eos> Details from six other unknown operations and safe houses were taken.<eos> Ralph had nothing to do with hacking the CIA.<eos> I know.<eos> But they don't.
Okay, okay.<eos> Maybe I do need to think about this.<eos> That's my Care Bear.<eos> Be strong.<eos> We'll be strong together.<eos> Now, you take as much time as you need to think about it.<eos> But I'll leave you with this...<eos> Do you want... our babies... to have sex... with each other?<eos> I vote no.<eos> And Melissa does, too.
- What?<eos> - Yeah, a tennis date.<eos> Oh, I told you all they needed was a little nudge.<eos> Carol, will you stop nudging them?<eos> It's just wrong.<eos> I mean, you're trying to play God.<eos> That's enough nudges.<eos> This one wasn't me.<eos> Melissa asked Todd.<eos> She did?
Well, I'm sure she prefers my foyer, but, uh, you know, it's been a really big day.<eos> Maybe just tonight we'll, uh, let her stay here.<eos> Sure. Okay, well, let's get you tied up.<eos> My uncle taught me this knot.<eos> It's called a clove hitch.<eos> Yeah, the old clove hitch.<eos> Know it well. - Oh, you do?<eos> - Everyone does.<eos> Anybody want to learn how to milk a cow?<eos> - Yes! I do!
So, first you grab the teat like this.<eos> Okay? You massage the teat, and then you gently tug on it.<eos> Did you really learn that on your uncle's farm or during your summers working as a male prostitute?<eos> That's a good one, Phil.<eos> Yeah, it is a risqué motion, but it gets the job done.<eos> - Milk!<eos> - We have milk!<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> Anybody want a sip?<eos> - Yeah, I do!
Uh... And just think, this could have all been avoided if you'd fixed my gol-dang door.<eos> Isn't this great?<eos> The best. So what exactly happened again with the cow?<eos> It was a double clove hitch knot.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's one of those freak happenings, you know?<eos> Here, I'll tell you exactly how it went down.<eos> I couldn't sleep. So I went downstairs, and I got myself a snack.<eos> And then I went to the living room, and I reread a Twilight.<eos> Then I did some knitting.
One day you'll blink... you'll be me.<eos> You know, I hate to spoil your moment of self-reflection, but what we did to you wore off hours ago.<eos> Your heroics out here-- that was all you.<eos> You don't say.<eos> I protected the president once.<eos> Thank you for allowing me to feel useful again.<eos> I wish I could say I wouldn't forget it, but, uh...<eos> There's advancements in neurological science every year.<eos> You never know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Come on, man, whose side are you on?<eos> Your side, our side, but, you know, it... it's not like her argument doesn't have merit.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I know, it's just...<eos> Julianna turned this Liam guy into some kind of superhuman, and then she died trying to stop him by experimenting on other innocents.<eos> If we're the only ones who know about it, then we can't just walk away, right?<eos> I know, I'm on your side, I get it.<eos> The only thing I don't get is... what changed for Cat.<eos> I mean, I didn't buy into this whole destiny spiel of hers at first, but...<eos> I do now.
Liam Cullen?<eos> Yeah, Liam Cullen.<eos> Cat, I was doing everything I could not to connect Liam to Julianna-- to keep the superhuman crap out of the equation.<eos> Okay, but you don't understand, that's the point.<eos> I don't want you to have to cover anymore.<eos> Why should you?<eos> Why should I...<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, we do.
Your father.<eos> In prison?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He had some pretty interesting things to say about you.<eos> And about Rebecca.<eos> Did Vincent put you up to this?<eos> No.<eos> JT did, actually.<eos> He cares about you, too, Cat.<eos> Everybody does.
Not his usual body man, Reggie Fitzwilliam.<eos> You're suggesting Mr. Fitzwilliam had enough and quit?<eos> I don't know, it could be a dead end or a wild goose chase.<eos> Palmer ordered Fitzwilliam to murder us, and he didn't... and now he's gone.<eos> Fitzwilliam has no other legal address than the Stoneheart corporate headquarters.<eos> But he does have a brother named Curtis.<eos> A firefighter who lives on Staten Island?<eos> You probably don't want to waste your time with this.<eos> I think you may be onto something.<eos> You do?
Quiet!<eos> - Shit, they're gone. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.<eos> - What now?<eos> - We have to find the vampires that were nesting here.<eos> We need to know if the infection spread.<eos> So, you're gonna go knocking on doors looking for sick vampires? Hmm?<eos> After dark?<eos> If the professor suggested that, you'd lock him away in here.<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> Yeah. I do.
Cardinal's doing all right for himself, huh?<eos> - You're late.<eos> - My apologies, Your Eminence.<eos> Not necessary, Nicholas.<eos> They won't be staying long.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> My clients wish to purchase the Occido Lumen.<eos> The Lumen is an exceedingly valuable artifact.<eos> And forgive me for saying so, but you two do not appear to have the resources to enter the game.<eos> We don't, but our clients do.
They're still very powerful, Justine.<eos> With contacts not only here, but in Albany, DC.<eos> They can still be very helpful to us.<eos> We agreed I do this my way, and I don't think that's my best move right now.<eos> - Mr. Mayor!<eos> - This is important.<eos> Councilwoman Faraldo, I worked with Nora Martinez at the CDC!<eos> Hey! Get his ass out of here!<eos> I believe you know my son, Zack?<eos> Yes, I do.
Stay close.<eos> Why didn't you wake me?<eos> My God!<eos> What happened?<eos> Kelly got close, Eph.<eos> Setrakian thinks the Master has made her one of the more - sentient strigoi.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> I'm pretty sure Zack saw her.<eos> You need to talk to him.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
What did he do to me?<eos> That was the Master.<eos> I am his partner.<eos> The Master?<eos> There is so much to tell you.<eos> I hated lying to you.<eos> But now you have experienced - His power for yourself.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Coco, I helped Him because I wanted Him to save my life.<eos> And He did.
The spanx.<eos> I am one popcorn shrimp away from blowing a button and killing the man.<eos> I still don't know how you got a date with the world's sexiest window washer.<eos> We have a connection.<eos> We were able to communicate with just our hands.<eos> Oh, that's cute, window man.<eos> But, let's talk with our voices now.<eos> We can talk with our hands later.<eos> You know I'm deaf, right?<eos> No. No, I did not.
A few months back... someone close to me... someone ill... asked the same questions Zimmerman did.<eos> If she'd asked VAL instead of me...<eos> _<eos> Let me guess...<eos> you need something, and it's a matter of some urgency.<eos> It's no wonder you're a detective.<eos> Could you possibly look up death records for a particular body?<eos> Think I can manage that.<eos> You got a name?<eos> I do.
Well, what are you waiting for?<eos> Lie back for a minute.<eos> I need to check your wound.<eos> Come on.<eos> Keep thinking about Charles Wynn, the man who was poisoned at the hospital by that group of yours.<eos> What hospital was it?<eos> - New York General.<eos> - Big place.<eos> Easy to see how someone could secretly administer a lethal dose of... what did you say?<eos> I didn't, actually.
So, David tells me you were away for a long time.<eos> Rehab?<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> I'vebeenthrough'em all ;<eos> rehab,psychward, boardingschool.<eos> - I should go check on David.<eos> - [grunts] So we're clear, I'm not big on sharing my toys.<eos> David's mine.<eos> - I don't mean to cause any trouble.<eos> - Oh, but girls like you never do.
If Alex beats you to that laptop, you'll all be dead.<eos> All of us will be.<eos> We go at 6 A.M.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll be back as soon as it arrives.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> I need a cigarette.<eos> Come on.<eos> Since when did you start smoking, Dr. O'Connor?<eos> I didn't.
But the SVR provided all that equipment down there, and I guarantee you the room is miked.<eos> I don't care if Victor knows what I think of him.<eos> You might not need one, but I sure as hell do.<eos> What the... what's wrong with you?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> You're with him!<eos> I knew that you were back then.<eos> But it ended.<eos> You told me it ended.<eos> - It did.
Ugh, even the ice is the same!<eos> That hint of bleach.<eos> Anyway, you didn't ask if you could use his goop.<eos> Malory, the whole thing about me using his "goop" was your idea!<eos> Prove it.<eos> So now let's talk about this name, Abbiejean.<eos> Don't you think she'd be better off if she were a... Malory?<eos> Thoughts?<eos> You do not want to know my thoughts.<eos> I do, Ken.

Malory?<eos> Thoughts?<eos> You do not want to know my thoughts.<eos> I do, Ken.<eos> I much very do.
Jesus!<eos> Okay, so, Ken, we've got a situation.<eos> We don't have anything. You have a situation.<eos> I am going home to Japan!<eos> Well unless you wanna swim there-- which, spoiler alert, you can't, it's too far-- you're gonna need my help!<eos> Ha! Because you also need my help.<eos> Only because you just broke two of my ribs, in addition to impaling me on a bamboo stake, on which, I think we both know, you smeared some poop!<eos> I-- And if you did I don't wanna know!<eos> Because... you'd have no idea what you're supposed to be looking for!<eos> Not that I do, necessarily, but--
Who's a ding, motherfucker?<eos> Andrew, it was a pleasure, as always.<eos> Governor, be well.<eos> Come on in, Ray.<eos> How was the drive from San Diego?<eos> You got what I came for?<eos> Oh, straight to the point, I like that.<eos> She doesn't often ask for my help, so you must have scared her half to death.<eos> Trust me, she deserved it.<eos> Maybe she did.
I just got dropped off.<eos> How do I get in?<eos> Don't move.<eos> I'm coming there.<eos> - You got this under control? - Yeah, shit's running itself.<eos> Ah, what a blessing you are.<eos> - What up?<eos> - These guys have snorted every grain of coke.<eos> We got to wind it down.<eos> No, we don't. We good.
Ready, sir.<eos> There will be an unexpected and totally unplanned pop quiz tomorrow.<eos> You're welcome for the heads-up.<eos> Please take advantage and study.<eos> I, um...<eos> I could use some more help with those proofs.<eos> Do you still want to get that cup of coffee?<eos> Um... listen, I shouldn't have texted you back.<eos> That was a mistake.<eos> So why did you?
Thomas is here.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Romero.<eos> He just walked into the fucking club looking for you. Shit.<eos> Don't let him leave.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> That's good.<eos> What should we do with him?<eos> We have some unfinished business.<eos> No, we don't.
So what'd you call me for?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I want you to clean this up.<eos> Too fucking risky.<eos> Your 3% of the franchise won't be worth much if this were ever made public.<eos> The other owners would not approve. You know that.<eos> You got a dead body in your office.<eos> You're thinking about a fucking deal?<eos> - I can't go to prison.<eos> - People like you rarely do.
You know that's true.<eos> You know it.<eos> I'll meet you back at the office.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I know what you're doing, Abby.<eos> Why don't you take a minute in here?<eos> I ain't staying.<eos> It'd be nice to have someone around the house to talk to.<eos> You got Ray.<eos> No, I don't.
Previously on Ray Donovan.<eos> Parkinson's follows a predictable course.<eos> Living alone isn't going to be your best option.<eos> He's getting worse.<eos> I think he should move in here with us.<eos> Okay.<eos> Nice to have someone around the house to talk to.<eos> You got Ray.<eos> No, I don't.
I'm gonna need my settlement money now.<eos> I'm not signing over all that money just so you can give it to somebody you just met, Bunch.<eos> Maybe he'd act more grown up if you didn't treat him like a fucking baby!<eos> Mind your business.<eos> We're in love.<eos> You better get used to me.<eos> What else?<eos> Well, yesterday I met a man, brown hair, short, seems to be in charge of running numbers.<eos> Got a name?<eos> Matter of fact I do.
Don't wear this in public till next week.<eos> Dybek recommended us to the NFL, and they're announcing us Monday.<eos> If you're gonna do that, have a little sensitivity.<eos> - Do what?<eos> - Don't fucking bring her here.<eos> You're a good man, Terry.<eos> Yeah. Good night.<eos> Hello.<eos> I thought you covered your tracks.<eos> - I did.
I told Augusto where I was going.<eos> Somehow he'd never heard of Bryn Mawr, but he's foreign, so I forgave that.<eos> When I told him about my 50th reunion, Augusto understood completely.<eos> I'm transformed.<eos> Noah wants money.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Were you gonna ask how the hearing went, or would you like to talk about your hairdo some more? I was.<eos> Of course I was going to ask.<eos> I just assumed it went smoothly.<eos> Well, it didn't.
And I'm like, bitch... Bitch, uh-uh, no.<eos> It's not fucking racist when your fucking Honda has two taillights out and it fucking...<eos> Myclienthasalwaysbeen an exemplary father, unusually close to his children.<eos> He understands that his living situation over the past two months has been difficult on the family.<eos> It's been difficult for him too.<eos> He's taking steps to correct it.<eos> In fact, he's taken a loan and is going to look at apartments later today. Two or three bedrooms in Brooklyn and should have a signed lease by August 1st at the latest.<eos> - A question. - Yes, Your Honor?<eos> Does Mr. Solloway plan to live alone in this two- or three-bedroom?<eos> - Yes, he does.
Do you mind if I ask how he died?<eos> Uh, no. No.<eos> Um... he died of something called secondary drowning.<eos> It's very rare.<eos> Children go swimming, and they... accidentally swallow too much water.<eos> - And then later...<eos> I didn't know how sick he was, and I didn't take him to the hospital.<eos> He died in his sleep.<eos> And so you carry that with you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hello?<eos> Fuck!<eos> I got a cab right here.<eos> So where am I going?<eos> The End.<eos> And hurry, my shift starts in ten minutes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So how long has that thing between you and Scotty been going on?<eos> What the fuck do you care?<eos> I don't, really.
Did he do something?<eos> I'm afraid there might be something wrong with me.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Does everyone just think I'm...<eos> I don't know what everyone thinks.<eos> No, of course I don't.<eos> I think there's something wrong with me.<eos> You got to stop saying that.<eos> People don't see me, Cole.<eos> They don't.
Love can't work without the trust, without the faith.<eos> You know, that's why people say when somebody cheats, they say he was unfaithful.<eos> Think about that word for a moment.<eos> It's not about the sex, kids.<eos> Does God exist?<eos> Uh, well, not... not an entirely inappropriate sequitur actually.<eos> I-I think of God the same way as I think of love.<eos> I think if you think that God exists, then He does, because your faith and your actions bring His presence into the world, and the same is true of love.<eos> If you believe in its power and you conduct your life with respect of its... of its sanctity, then it'll always be there to serve you.<eos> But if you don't, then...
Oh, the young ones are okay, they like me, but the older ones... trickier.<eos> Right.<eos> And this is for Stacey. Oh, cute.<eos> And Whitney, if she ever decides to stay with us.<eos> She's the oldest one, right, the one who had that thing with Scott?<eos> Yeah. That's her.<eos> Hmm.<eos> She is never gonna stay in this room.<eos> No, I know.<eos> But Noah doesn't.
I'm sorry you had to see that.<eos> Really.<eos> Look...<eos> You gotta stop coming after Scotty.<eos> You have to leave him alone.<eos> He got me pregnant.<eos> I know he did.<eos> I really care about him.<eos> I think he really cares about me.<eos> He doesn't.
Yeah, I came by to check on you, of course, see how you're doing.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Well, your mom says you're doing a lot better.<eos> Yeah, I guess so.<eos> Any more stomachaches?<eos> Yeah, if I eat something that I shouldn't.<eos> Bitch of a disease, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Well, did your GI recommend Humira injections?<eos> Yeah. Uh, he did.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> It was where he said it would be.<eos> If it had gone off, it would have killed a lot of people.<eos> But it didn't.
"Do not think it strange<eos> "concerning the fiery trial which is to try you,<eos> "as though a strange thing happened to you.<eos> "Be sober, be vigilant,<eos> "because your adversary, the devil, walks about like a lion, seeking whom to devour."<eos> Simple stuff.<eos> You might have picked the wrong day to lose that compass.<eos> Guess who wrote it.<eos> Peter.<eos> Of course he did.
I'm actually looking for something for Salim.<eos> Don't know why he wants it.<eos> Have you seen her?<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, we remember that one.<eos> You worked on her?<eos> He owes me money.<eos> Yeah, yeah. He mentioned that.<eos> He mention it was 15 grand?<eos> No, he didn't.
When I left for university, I never went back.<eos> I thought she died before you went to uni.<eos> She's alive?<eos> That's where I was when I went away last.<eos> Does Dad know about any of this?<eos> No.<eos> I...<eos> We've got a grandma?<eos> ! - She doesn't want to know, Mats.<eos> - She does. Bollocks!
- What?<eos> - It's our last chance to try.<eos> Our last chance to save Max.<eos> What's the point in saving him?<eos> We're never getting out of here.<eos> Leo, we don't know what will happen.<eos> Neither does Hobb.<eos> Niska.<eos> Don't you want to find out?<eos> I do.
- Not this again.<eos> Passage up the river, a map through the wasteland, and nothing left to lose.<eos> Sunny, listen to me.<eos> There is no through the wasteland.<eos> There's just death and drought and more death, and you sure as shit don't need a map to find it.<eos> I'm leaving, Waldo, with Veil.<eos> She's pregnant.<eos> So what?<eos> I imagine I've got a dozen pups pissing on posts around here.<eos> Every Clipper does.
Previously on "The Mentalist"...<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> You can't keep pulling me from the path of oncoming trains.<eos> There's new trains coming every day.<eos> You have information about the case?<eos> My brother does.
There's new trains coming every day.<eos> You have information about the case?<eos> My brother does.<eos> Gabriel.<eos> He's a psychic.<eos> There's a thing inside you.<eos> Your cure will come with the number three.<eos> I didn't know where you were.<eos> You knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
Or we could go to a restaurant.<eos> No big deal. It's not like we're hiring a caterer.<eos> We don't have a gift registry or anything.<eos> Sure. Okay.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Well, I have to get you a ring.<eos> I already have one.<eos> That is for us.<eos> You need one for you.<eos> I do?
Have them rush the DNA tests.<eos> Pull some strings if you have to.<eos> Why the rush?<eos> Still got a lot of media interest.<eos> The bosses want to be able to announce we got the guy.<eos> For that, we need a coroner's report, so let's get on it.<eos> Okay, right away.<eos> Hey, did Abbott give you the news? Hey.<eos> We're having a real wedding at his house.<eos> He did.
Oh, I'm just taking a little look around, thinking about membership.<eos> Is that supposed to be amusing?<eos> Mr. Peterson, this man said that he was from your office.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> It's fine, Stacey.<eos> Stacey, Mr. Peterson and I go way back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How was your little trip down to Rio Bravo?<eos> You know about that?<eos> Of course I do.
You don't get TV.<eos> You're the cop who shot me.<eos> Lieutenant Koto.<eos> I thought I killed you.<eos> I wish you had.<eos> Then why did you wear Kevlar?<eos> A shot to the heart would have been too messy.<eos> That's not the way I wanted to go out.<eos> You wanted a head shot.<eos> I still do.
Casey!<eos> Get out here, please.<eos> Whatever happens tonight, know that we love you and we care for you.<eos> And I'm so proud of- what is it?<eos> - There's a bug in the toilet!<eos> - What does it look like?<eos> - I don't know! It's a bug!<eos> - I mean seriously, his mother hates me.<eos> She thinks I'm ruining his life.<eos> - Well, of course she does.
- It's not...<eos> Squad's gassed up, Sergeant.<eos> Sergeant, I don't know the first thing about...<eos> No one spends more time drooling in front of this formica than you.<eos> You've seen how it works.<eos> But, Burgess...<eos> What?<eos> Uneasy lieth the head that weareth the crown upon the top of thine head.<eos> - What does that mean? - She knows.<eos> I don't, actually.
Livia... I'll replace you with a donkey.<eos> Get that, will you, Caiaphas?<eos> Head.<eos> Excellent.<eos> You both may go.<eos> I need to speak with your high priest.<eos> And the lesson is, don't play politics unless you're good at it.<eos> This coin...<eos> It has two heads.<eos> It does, doesn't it?
Are you seriously gonna let Garza try anything?<eos> No.<eos> Get Carlos on speed dial.<eos> I want him ready to roll, no matter what.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Why take the chance?<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> We served together.<eos> You don't win wars with sentimentality, Marcellus.<eos> No, you don't.
Yeah, I can do that.<eos> But I'm also paying him a visit.<eos> He'll be suspicious if I didn't.<eos> Look, Kiera, if you really could go home, would-<eos> In a heartbeat.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Find any way of doing it?<eos> You know the first thing Kellogg's skeeze corp will look for is a virus.<eos> Send in a virus, who catches a cold?<eos> Emily does.
It looks empty.<eos> Yet worth protecting.<eos> Piron guards.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> Yeah, let's do this.<eos> Ok, remember, you don't have your CMR so your suit only has it's minimal functions.<eos> Body armour, electro-taser, active camouflage.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Alec, we've got a problem.<eos> Yeah, you sure do.
Yeah, I can do that.<eos> Joining me in the dragon's den?<eos> Just visiting. Like you.<eos> I'm not visiting.<eos> I'm a resident.<eos> There's work here I believe in.<eos> You took a hit.<eos> You took it to heart.<eos> You have other choices.<eos> We all do.
Alec?<eos> Clear.<eos> Clear. Move.<eos> Don't move!<eos> Identify yourself!<eos> Do it slowly.<eos> Let's go, let's go!<eos> He's out!<eos> You really think you're worth it?<eos> Somebody does.
Travis... wh... what are you doing?<eos> Vasquez!<eos> Go!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Everyone, get out!<eos> Time's up.<eos> This place is a write-off.<eos> Like my dream of going home.<eos> You can't give up now. We don't have Brad.<eos> Well, apparently we never did.
- Cheers.<eos> - To joshing! (All) Joshing.<eos> (Gina) This is fun. Ooh, you know what we could do after lunch?<eos> Walk on the beach.<eos> But it's the middle of winter.<eos> Which is ideal, you know?<eos> Not too hot, no crowds. The sand doesn't get everywhere 'cause it's basically frozen.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Who brought their beach boots?<eos> [Raspy] "I did."
- Carla wanted them.<eos> - Who's Carla?<eos> Owns the Bonobo cafe.<eos> I'm gonna sell my first editions.<eos> They're probably worth a few thousand, I'm gonna give her a break.<eos> See, I told you, Sage, that this would clear my head.<eos> Okay, $65.<eos> I'm borrowing from the kitty, for the kitty.<eos> - Every little bit adds up, right?<eos> - It does. It really does.
You take your stained books and get out of my café.<eos> - I don't want them.<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> I don't want you to have them.<eos> Take your 60 bucks, shove it up your ass!<eos> Could I just have the hot sauce?<eos> Give me that sack.<eos> Give me that goddamned sack!<eos> Why are you acting like the last four months didn't mean anything?<eos> - Because they didn't.
This is his Web site.<eos> "The man who brought down Lucas Reem."<eos> Well, that line may work at a last call hookup, but I'm afraid the truth is not quite so heroic.<eos> You know this guy?<eos> I do. He's all over the case files.<eos> Todd Spanna had an apartment across from Lucas Reem.<eos> One night, he sees Reem hosing blood off his hands, so he calls the cops, turns him in, ends Lucas Reem's run.<eos> Well, it looks like he's turned that into a little celebrity for himself.<eos> Did a couple of talk shows. I think he even wrote a book?<eos> Yes, he did.
What's on your mind?<eos> [ breathing shakily ] It's never known anything but death.<eos> It's not like us.<eos> It's not like anybody.<eos> Are you saying we should just hand rachael over?<eos> Henry...<eos> People weren't willing to give us a chance.<eos> How can we assume the worst of this child?<eos> Still, we don't know what's really going on.<eos> Nobody does.
-I'll go check it out. -Oh--<eos> Look, there's no going back to Oz.<eos> And with the Wizard gone, Dorothy will be fine.<eos> So does this mean no more adventure?<eos> I think we have all the adventure that we can handle right here.<eos> -What about--?<eos> -Dark Charlie?<eos> She's, uh... quiet.<eos> Just gotta keep moving forward.<eos> We all do.
And the best way to do that is to get him to say yes.<eos> You ever spend time around a toddler?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Like, "No, no, no, no!"<eos> It's the same thing with these cons.<eos> Some gangster wants something that belongs to you, get him saying yes, and watch the resistance just fall away.<eos> Okay, first question.<eos> Let's start with the personal...<eos> Alicia? Your law partner recently pleaded guilty to a drug charge.<eos> Mr. Prady, do you have a question for Alicia about this?<eos> I do.
Kalinda got an affidavit from Toronto.<eos> That's great news.<eos> We may need Peter's help if this doesn't work.<eos> I know, I'm ready to call him.<eos> All right, wait. Uh, that's somebody on my other line now.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, Diane, this is Eli.<eos> Eli, I don't have time right now.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
What do you mean?<eos> Your plea.<eos> The Brady violation.<eos> It, um... okay, uh, I... let me call you back.<eos> Your Honor, we would like to subpoena the backup drives of the CPD's Fourth District.<eos> This is completely unnecessary, Your Honor.<eos> Detective Prima stated on the record he never received an e-mail from Toronto.<eos> Then he shouldn't mind us taking a look at the backup.<eos> You know you only have four hours left, Counselor?<eos> I do, Your Honor.
And yet, I do love the dramatic.<eos> Subpoena approved.<eos> And if I were you, Ms. Lockhart, I would race - out of this court right now.<eos> - Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> Oh, we're in.<eos> That's CPD's server.<eos> Okay, good. Now, can you access the individual e-mail archives?<eos> I can access anything, Kalinda.<eos> Good, 'cause I need positive proof that he received this e-mail.<eos> Nope, he did not.
He thinks you'd bring fresh gusto to the justices' deliberations.<eos> And when are you meeting with Flaherty and Dominguez?<eos> Well, there's no plan to.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You are our man.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You sound surprised.<eos> Well, you've been Peter Florrick's man for years, and Peter Florrick wouldn't cross the street to stop me from choking, so yeah, I guess I am surprised.<eos> - Things change.<eos> - No, they don't.
Crossing Bartlet.<eos> Proceeding northbound.<eos> One-David-One.<eos> Crossing Temple.<eos> We've still got a visual<eos> - on the suspect vehicle? - Copy that, One-David-Ten.<eos> All units, be advised, suspect vehicle is continuing north on Everly Boulevard.<eos> It's probably best if we don't talk.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
Hide, hide, hide.<eos> Okay, good, good.<eos> Good girl, good girl.<eos> All that hand-wringing, Felix.<eos> She's just a normal girl.<eos> Yes.<eos> Careful with the gloating.<eos> You're going to get more wrinkles.<eos> I love alcohol!<eos> Yes, we all do.
Very.<eos> Not one to pierce the veil, is she?<eos> No. And where are you with her new monitor?<eos> Uh, there are three candidates vying.<eos> We'll see which one she picks.<eos> Good.<eos> You and I have a... problem closer to home.<eos> How's Rachel progressing?<eos> Well, her mobility is not looking good, but her aphasia's improving, and she still has value.<eos> Does she?
Or we could just kiss. No, no, Jason, no.<eos> You need to stop this.<eos> - I'm married.<eos> - I know.<eos> Hey, marriage is complicated.<eos> I'm safe.<eos> No one needs to know.<eos> This is a business relationship.<eos> If this has become something else in your head... maybe you're grasping at something you never had.<eos> I did, though, didn't I?
- Okay.<eos> Shit!<eos> We're closed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Okay, I hear you.<eos> Come in.<eos> That looks like it hurts.<eos> - You should see the other guy.<eos> - I did.
Ugh! I'm sick of this shit!<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah. It didn't penetrate the glove.<eos> Well, I'm guessing that's the stuff they want me to deliver.<eos> We need to test it.<eos> How?<eos> On what?<eos> I don't know, but we cannot take that with us until we know more about it.<eos> - How do we know it'll work on the Espheni?<eos> - We don't. Not yet.
And you could still be critical to our objective.<eos> I've been given some time back, Dad, a chance to fight for more, experience the life you gave me the way I was meant to.<eos> We've both been given a second chance.<eos> It's important that we make it count.<eos> So this little guy has been struck twice, and still nothing.<eos> You think the same applies for us?<eos> Maybe.<eos> When this thing snatched our new formula back into its capsule, it suddenly became nonlethal.<eos> How do we know this does not disrupt the ingredient lethal to the Espheni?<eos> We don't.
I photographed him meeting a South African Intelligence officer--<eos> Eugene Venter.<eos> We think he's planning to stage an attack and blame the student groups here who are protesting apartheid.<eos> That's Reuben Ncgobo.<eos> We think Venter won't be able to resist coming after him once he knows he's here.<eos> Ncgobo's going to set another meeting with Todd.<eos> We're hoping Venter shows up to kill Ncgobo.<eos> That's when we grab him.<eos> How do you know he'll go for it?<eos> We don't.
As long as we keep him far enough back, we should be fine.<eos> Ncgobo was talking about his sons.<eos> He has four of them.<eos> He said he hopes they all become fighters, like him.<eos> And you think that's a good thing?<eos> What?<eos> I felt for him and his kids, fighting this brutal, horrendous war.<eos> I mean, it's horrible, but it's... admirable in a way. It's brave. They don't have a lot of choices.<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
How so?<eos> I had to pretend to be friends with people I really didn't like-- terrible people.<eos> There was a man-- John Reisling.<eos> He's in San Quentin now.<eos> He was a bad guy.<eos> Uh, what did he do?<eos> Bad things.<eos> Like what?<eos> Did he kill people?<eos> He did.
I'm sorry.<eos> I was just watching you and thinking... thank God for Libby Masters.<eos> Oh. You've been so kind to Joy and beyond generous to me.<eos> Over these past few months, if it hadn't been for you, I don't...<eos> Of course.<eos> Anything for friends.<eos> Your mother's rocking the baby, humming "Chattanooga Choo Choo"...<eos> Honey, Lisa lapped up every last drop of that ice cream--<eos> Did you know she was going to do that tonight, throw Bill at me in that way?<eos> You did.
Actually, I might know someone who's a whole lot better than nothing.<eos> I talked with Zookeeper Steve this morning.<eos> They were astounded at our success with Gil.<eos> Can't imagine how we managed to pull that off.<eos> Well... what happened yesterday was no solution at all.<eos> I wasn't looking for a solution.<eos> - I was looking for an answer.<eos> - To what? Whether or not it could be done...<eos> Whether I could do it-- we could do it.<eos> And we did.
In the meantime, to, convince you to get past your objections to the smell of my casino...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Please enjoy yourselves.<eos> It's on the house.<eos> We have one more candidate.<eos> This is Nora Everett.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't seem to find your file, Miss Everett.<eos> Do you... do you remember what year you participated in the study?<eos> I didn't.
Maybe it's your turn to do the same for me.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We can do 9:15.<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> So, what do you tell him?<eos> Bill... when he asks what you've been doing all day?<eos> He doesn't.
We won't be faking.<eos> Our scent only arouses 1/4 of the women.<eos> I wouldn't sell a shampoo that only cleans hair - one out of every four times.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But when the placebo works, it's effect on the body is very real.<eos> We see it all the time in the clinic.<eos> Somebody is suffering from a sexual dysfunction and they feel like there's no hope.<eos> But then they hear about us, and all of a sudden, there's a way forward, a path toward a cure.<eos> So, we continue with the study, but tell the women the thing they're smelling contains pheromones.<eos> Because it does.
We're with you.<eos> Let's finish this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So... what's so important that it couldn't wait until tomorrow?<eos> I tapped the phones and bugged the suites of the Arab Delegation, as you asked, and, um, this was earlier tonight:<eos> It's a conversation between Mrs. Al Fayeed and the lead delegate, Anwar Awad.<eos> The ICC is refusing to extend immunity to Colonel Al-Ghazi.<eos> I gave Mahmoud my word, and you gave me yours.<eos> I said I would try.<eos> And I did.
We don't want to draw any attention.<eos> Kono, nod if all the hostages are okay. - Good.<eos> - All right, Chin,<eos> I need you to show me the shooters and where they're positioned.<eos> All right, stand by, guys.<eos> We've got six threats all armed with Steyr machine pistols.<eos> Three at the north watching the hostages, the other three with the artwork.<eos> All right, I'll have SWAT ready as soon as we can make entry.<eos> - Tell me you got the schematics.<eos> - I did.
Well, we can still hope for stomach cancer. Ooh.<eos> That's cold, cos.<eos> I'd settle for a shiv in the lunch line. What's a shiv?<eos> Hey.<eos> Look who's sporting the hardware.<eos> You are looking at the number one girl in her age group on the entire island.<eos> What did I tell you, huh?<eos> No thanks to Marathon Man here, though, right?<eos> Listen, I helped with everything except the running part, okay?<eos> - He did, Uncle Steve, really. - Yes.
I've missed you.<eos> I've missed you, too.<eos> Where's Cruella?<eos> Uh, she must have slipped away, most likely to warn Gold.<eos> We should clear out before they get back.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I'm okay.<eos> Hook, what's wrong?<eos> You gave Ursula everything she wanted.<eos> But I almost didn't, love.
So the Dark One's returned.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's only one person who can help us drive him back out.<eos> H-h-he's here?<eos> Th-that's... that's impossible.<eos> Well, did you really think he'd stay away? The dagger...<eos> you need to hand it over so we can stop this fight before it starts.<eos> The dagger?<eos> I-I don't have the dagger.<eos> Killian does.
Did you know when we were kids? Of course not.<eos> But now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I learned it all.<eos> - How?<eos> - Does it really matter?<eos> It doesn't change anything.<eos> You screwed me over before we were even born.<eos> I had no more say in what happened than you did.<eos> But your parents did.
I've already put the men in position, General.<eos> They are waiting for my command.<eos> Forgive me, My Lord, but you do not need to engage in this battle.<eos> The men fight for you.<eos> I will fight for my people... with my men and with you.<eos> You need not be in the middle of this, My Lord.<eos> That is exactly where I need to be.<eos> Go on.<eos> The men are ready. - Do you have doubts?<eos> - I do.
They will do as you command them.<eos> See that it is done, high priest.<eos> That will be all, vizier.<eos> Why did you travel to thebes with the pharaoh?<eos> I'm his guest.<eos> And i am the queen of egypt.<eos> You will address me in the proper manner.<eos> I-i apologize, my queen.<eos> Where did he find you?<eos> He didn't.
Don't you hurt him.<eos> Guys, there are people looking for me.<eos> If they find me, they'll find you.<eos> Now you are going to go into her head and you're gonna retrieve a memory.<eos> If you do that, if you help me, you'll be helping Max.<eos> Do I make myself clear?<eos> Give him a list of everything you're gonna need.<eos> Sebastian, brother.<eos> I didn't think you made it out.<eos> He didn't.
They're shouting.<eos> - Who?<eos> - What are they saying?<eos> Where is she?<eos> - You are in trouble.<eos> - Because of you.<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Don't be afraid.<eos> - You told her.<eos> - Yes, I did.
It's gonna be fine.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> Something happened, something people are willing to kill to find and whatever it was involved my father.<eos> I'm not doing this for Braxton or for you.<eos> I'm doing it for me.<eos> I need to know the truth.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I'll have it to you by 9.<eos> I thought you said you had it already.<eos> And I do.
Shit.<eos> You okay? Uh, yeah.<eos> You?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Get the fuck out!<eos> Get the fuck out! - Whoa. Whoa, whoa!<eos> - Come here! Come here! - What are you...?<eos> Okay! Listen up!<eos> My partner and I, having been assaulted, have legal grounds to use deadly fucking force!<eos> We do. We do.
I'll be f... I'll be fine.<eos> Come on, this way.<eos> No, no. It's... It's this way.<eos> Are you questioning my sense of direction?<eos> Or is that where your friends have set the trap for me?<eos> There is no trap.<eos> And... it's this way.<eos> The system upgrade should be completed about the same time we finish repairs on level 8 and 9.<eos> Do you still have blind spots down there from Wolfe's escape?<eos> We do.
The music was so intense, you just sort of went out of yourself.<eos> I felt it tremendously.<eos> I was leading it.<eos> When I was seven, the choir of our church gave a program at the local theater, and I was on that program...<eos> And I played some song, I don't remember what it was, and these two women, two white women, in the audience heard me.<eos> One of them was the woman that my mother worked for, and the other one was a music teacher, Mrs. Mazzanovich, and they decided right then and there to give me lessons.<eos> And so, for five years after that, I studied piano, classical piano, with this teacher.<eos> I crossed the railroad tracks every weekend to get to Mrs. Mazzanovich.<eos> And, you know, railroad tracks in the South are supposed to be dividing the blacks from the whites.<eos> Well, it really did.
She'd get into moods of depression about the whole business, the personal relationship, cursing and smashing things, and this worsened as the time went by.<eos> ♪ Gonna see my sweet honey baby ♪<eos> ♪ Gonna break this chain off and run ♪ ♪ I'm gonna lay down somewhere shady ♪<eos> All I did was work, work, work.<eos> I was always tired.<eos> I was always tired.<eos> I could never sleep.<eos> You see, music always goes through my head, which means the more I played, the less I could relax.<eos> I kept thinking Andy would let me rest.<eos> He never did.
Right.<eos> He didn't know how to touch me and he never had enough time.<eos> He'd come to see me late at night and be there two hours and leave.<eos> I knew that she was dating other people.<eos> We agreed that we could both have our own outside partners... but we would work together for the sake of the business and the child.<eos> I can't sit here and speak about Aunt Nina and Uncle Andy's marriage.<eos> What I can say is that participation and activism during the '60s... rendered chaos in any individual's lives.<eos> People sacrificed sanity, well-being, life.<eos> Nina Simone was a free spirit in an era that didn't really appreciate a woman's genius.<eos> So what does that do to a household and a family?
Considering how they've been playing lately, it does feel like a job, so I guess it qualifies.<eos> Well, they're down eight in the second, so...<eos> Well...<eos> Wait, do you want to join?<eos> What's misery without a little company, right?<eos> So this little doohickey erased Margaux's entire computer?<eos> Worked like a charm.<eos> Uh, now let's put that away before you do the same to mine.<eos> Well, thank you for trusting me.<eos> I don't. Seriously.
I think you'll find today's most intriguing story on page 20, bottom-left corner.<eos> "According to Uzbek authorities, Father Aleksandr Nabiyev a local priest in the Tashkent region of Uzbekistan..."<eos> You're intrigued because a priest was kidnapped?<eos> No.<eos> I'm intrigued because the priest is not a priest.<eos> From what I hear, the good Father Nabiyev is an agent of the CIA.<eos> That's a crime, Agent Keen.<eos> Going back to the Cold War the CIA has a long and controversial history of using religious figures as spies in violation of executive orders internal CIA policy and promises made by every president since Ford.<eos> - You know who kidnapped this agent?<eos> - I do.
But, um, we can celebrate tonight.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Okay. - Okay, great.<eos> - Ezra.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Um, that's not the only thing that I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> Jackie did review my application.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Well, I wrote a letter to the admission's board hoping that it would land on her desk.<eos> And it did.
Write that letter.<eos> And I don't even want to go to Talmadge.<eos> I was just scared that if I didn't get in, I'd be stuck here.<eos> Well, now you don't have to worry.<eos> I reviewed the tenant contracts, made some notes. And I organized the contractor bills.<eos> They tend to overcharge for labor, so you got to watch out for that.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Do what?<eos> Quit because of what happened the other night.<eos> Yes, I do.
So technically, they're mine.<eos> Until someone buys them.<eos> I have a list of questions here from last year's pageant.<eos> Let's try a few.<eos> How would you reverse the extinction of today's endangered species?<eos> Hanna, these pageants aren't just about being pretty anymore.<eos> Pretty isn't the point.<eos> Judges don't give out crowns to living lollipops.<eos> You need to have an opinion about the world we live in.<eos> I do.
She had to leave early for a catering gig in Philly.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> I forgot. I'll call the landlord.<eos> Can I tell her who stopped by?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm Eric, Talia's husband.<eos> Of course.<eos> Right. Um, Talia talks about you all the time.<eos> She does?
I stole these from a child's lunchbox.<eos> I have 23 of them.<eos> Children, not biscuits.<eos> Not my children, students.<eos> Let's start over.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> It's quite a ways for you to come for an interview.<eos> You must really have your heart set on Oxford.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I covered for you in school, but...<eos> My brother is on borrowed time, Hanna.<eos> I can't be sitting in Spanish conjugating verbs.<eos> I really need to talk to Cyrus.<eos> You think we're going to find "A" through Cyrus?<eos> You're lucky if you can even find Cyrus.<eos> I already did.
Over and over again.<eos> It's time to put a stop to it.<eos> This isn't a decision i can make on my own, okay?<eos> This affects aria, spencer, and emily just as much as me.<eos> Okay, well, you don't have time to discuss it with them.<eos> Caleb, if i tell tanner, everything unravels.<eos> All of our secrets, all the lies we've told.<eos> The time we were in new york, shana, aria.<eos> Okay, well, your friends will understand.<eos> And if they don't?
She has to get to Ali and ask about the phone number.<eos> Jason.<eos> Hello, Spencer.<eos> I left you messages. I know.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I don't think that's such a good idea.<eos> Jason...<eos> We've pretty much exhausted anything that we have to say to each other.<eos> You need to listen to me, okay?<eos> No, I don't.
We just got here. The only thing we're doing is taking off our jackets, heating up a frozen pizza, and if you calm down, we might even offer you a slice.<eos> You know, I'm good. While it's defrosting, we're gonna be in Scranton.<eos> - Let's go, Mike.<eos> - You can't just throw him in the back of your car like a pair of boots.<eos> This is a big decision to make.<eos> Yeah, and I made it.<eos> - I wanna go back.<eos> - Mike, stop.<eos> Do not be reckless with this. You have a target on your back, and I know you wanna do the right thing.<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's been a long day, ladies.<eos> But if Kendra doesn't know what you'll be asking her on the stand...<eos> I'm not putting Kendra on the stand.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - Why?<eos> No jury is going to be swayed by a witness who earlier in the day saw eight fingers on one hand, and was picking up NPR through her cavity fillings.<eos> We are not that desperate.<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> - We don't have anybody else.<eos> Yes, we do.
I'm so excited, I get to have my senior prom in a dungeon.<eos> You know what?<eos> Forget it, Emily.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> You did that on purpose.<eos> - Get over yourself.<eos> - Stop, this is already stressful enough as it is.<eos> - Spencer, don't start...<eos> - I didn't start anything.<eos> The quitter did.
I am going to save your life.<eos> And I am about to get up in front of a bunch of people and tell them how I plan on doing it.<eos> It makes it really hard for me to do that or even care about doing that when you don't seem to care at all!<eos> Well, that's your problem.<eos> Well, the word's spreading.<eos> This was a good idea, Hunt... a master class in neurosurgery.<eos> This is gonna put Amelia Shepherd on the map. Mm.<eos> Unless it fails.<eos> It won't.<eos> If it does...
It is located.<eos> The TARDIS is located.<eos> The TARDIS will be procured.<eos> Procure the TARDIS. Procure the TARDIS.<eos> Procure. Procure.<eos> Davros is the child of war.<eos> A war that wouldn't end... a thousand years of fighting, till nobody could remember why.<eos> So Davros, he created a new kind of warrior... one that wouldn't bother with THAT question.<eos> A mutant in a tank that would never, ever stop.<eos> And they never did.
"Number four, lock my desk."<eos> You've already failed.<eos> All right, give me that.<eos> Who makes a New Year's resolution to stop watching cat videos?<eos> A lonely federal agent who may be in need of a cat.<eos> What are your New Year's resolutions, huh?<eos> You got to see mine.<eos> Show me yours.<eos> He stopped drinking coffee.<eos> No, I did not.
Why are you gettin' involved, asshole?<eos> -You've spilled my milk, man!<eos> -What milk have I spilled?<eos> -This milk here...<eos> -This milk here?<eos> Be careful: your milk's all spilled...<eos> Milk! Milk!<eos> Your milk's getting spilled!<eos> -You want some too?<eos> -Yeah, I do!
Wait for me!<eos> Esteban!<eos> Wait for me!<eos> Esteban!<eos> -What are you doing?<eos> -You don't love me at all!<eos> What, don't I love you?<eos> Don't laugh, you son of a bitch!<eos> You don't love me!<eos> I do...
Because I care about you, Esteban.<eos> OK, I'll wait for you to call.<eos> Aritz!<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I like being here.<eos> I've waited for you for two days.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You still thinking about suicide?<eos> Not really, I don't think about that anymore.<eos> Well, I do.
Jim Anderoff.<eos> You're the number two here?<eos> I am.<eos> Where's Lang?<eos> Oh, so you didn't hear.<eos> Well, it turns out we're not the only ones looking into the Zapata cartel.<eos> The FBI has been building a case against them longer than us, so he got pulled to Washington,<eos> I guess to hash it out with his bosses.<eos> And no one told me?<eos> I just did.
I love you.<eos> I'm sorry, but... I don't really know what that means right now.<eos> They let that lowlife Freeman out of prison, and I'm the guy hauled into the FBI?<eos> Yeah, Mr. Pemberton, because you were threatening that lowlife and now he's dead.<eos> Dead?<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, really.<eos> Did you want to do a little dance there, Jason? You want me to be sad?<eos> He shot my sister.<eos> He didn't.
Did you set me up?<eos> Look, I'm on your side here, Alex.<eos> Alex, Alex, stop...<eos> Shut up, you son of a bitch!<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> Move!<eos> - Rockwell!<eos> - He has a knife in the car!<eos> I don't have a clear shot.<eos> I do.
They just made everything really tiny and hoped nobody would find it.<eos> It's all there in its original German.<eos> From its repeated references to "Die Welt wird frei von Upirs sein."<eos> Um, "making the world upir-free,"<eos> and, "Das Pathogen zeigt keine Wirkung "an denen ihm ausgesetzen Menschen."<eos> "The pathogen doesn't affect human beings exposed to it."<eos> It's abundantly clear that Spivak's development of the LoPS pathogen was and is the primary catalyst for the extermination of all upir.<eos> - Does Roman have it?<eos> - Not to my knowledge, no.<eos> Of course he doesn't.
Something with the Croats up in Pottstown.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> And you didn't hear it from me.<eos> Oh, Shelley.<eos> I've missed you so much.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - Where'd you find this?<eos> I didn't.
Fuck it, and fuck you!<eos> Andreas was too stupid to be allowed to live.<eos> All those people died because of him.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - Have you seen that guy Shandor lately?<eos> Do you know why they closed down the warehouse?<eos> - All of them dead because of Andreas.<eos> - Lies.<eos> Lies. I didn't have anything to do with his death.<eos> - Peter did.
This is your Destiny.<eos> I already know why you're calling, but if you're feeling redundant, state your need after the beep.<eos> Dee?<eos> Honey?<eos> I got us breakfast.<eos> She's not here.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She didn't come home last night.<eos> I thought maybe she crashed at your place.<eos> Well, she didn't.
Not all cops are dirty.<eos> Yeah, we'll keep that in mind.<eos> What's up with all the assault rifles?<eos> Private security.<eos> This isn't San Diego.<eos> You might want to hire some protection.<eos> What are you guys doing over there?<eos> Air quality sensors.<eos> So, got any veggie burgers?<eos> As a matter of fact, we do.
Had you guessed?<eos> Mmm, I'd guessed you hadn't slept with guys before.<eos> I'd thought maybe you'd slept with a couple of women.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> What's stopped you?<eos> You don't have to answer.<eos> How do you admit to someone you've never been in a relationship?<eos> Who wants to hear?<eos> And when they do, who wants to stay?<eos> I do.
Yeah, I guess.<eos> You don't just stop loving someone.<eos> How do you feel about Nicole and Dave getting married?<eos> I didn't know about the engagement until you told me.<eos> I'm happy for her if that's what she wants.<eos> So you're not the least bit jealous?<eos> I'm not the jealous type.<eos> That's not what she told us.<eos> She said that you were possessive and controlling.<eos> She did?
I don't blame her for covering her own ass.<eos> I blame the judge for not seeing through it.<eos> The system's rigged to favor the pretty white girl.<eos> I know the score.<eos> I've seen it too many times.<eos> Yeah, I get it Juan.<eos> System failed to deliver justice, so you took justice into your own hands.<eos> I had nothing to do with what happened to that lady's fiancee.<eos> We don't wish that on anyone.<eos> Jack: But you did, Juan.
Win some, lose some.<eos> Elizabeth looks at you very differently now.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know how hard this is for you, with Paige.<eos> It's hard for The Centre, too.<eos> They're learning from their mistakes.<eos> Jared murdered his family.<eos> Well, that's hardly a risk here.<eos> I just want Paige to make her own decisions.<eos> We all do.
Although he has nailed his backstory.<eos> Lando Cal--?<eos> Por qué no te callas?<eos> Will you shut up?<eos> I need to think!<eos> Don't yell at me, I didn't lose her.<eos> Now just try to retrace your steps.<eos> Well, I wasn't in the sofa cushions.<eos> Well, you could have said that!<eos> I did.
But instead, I was the partner who made you sick.<eos> Can I tell you something about Martin Ormankupp?<eos> On our second day as partners, Martin Ormankupp was kicked in the crotch by a police horse.<eos> Not what I was expecting you to say.<eos> Of all the cases that we worked, that moment was the one that bonded us the most.<eos> Because that's what we laughed about.<eos> After his surgery and months long rehab.<eos> It was a terrible ordeal for both Martin and Heather Ormankupp. Mm.<eos> So you think we can laugh about me poisoning you?<eos> Yes, I do.
MIRANDA: Oh, 2% left to upload.<eos> This is how we beat this thing.<eos> This is how we get visualization.<eos> We are going to have a tangible, anatomically correct 3-D model of this exact tumor, and correlate to the adjacent organs...<eos> - Done!<eos> In 10 hours.<eos> The longest documented surviving type II case that I could find lived for all of 18 months.<eos> In an ICU his entire life, hooked up to feeding tubes and a ventilator.<eos> That's not a life. That's not a life I want for my son.<eos> (STAMMERS) Neither do I. I...
His bones can break if we're changing his diaper.<eos> We're doctors. We can handle it.<eos> If anyone can handle it, we can.<eos> I'm not saying we can't handle it. I'm asking if we should.<eos> Yeah, we're doctors. Maybe we are better equipped to make an educated decision here.<eos> And maybe we were given this baby for a reason.<eos> KAREN:<eos> (SIGHS) You called your mom.<eos> Yeah. People need their mom in a crisis.<eos> No, not everybody does.
He's driving.<eos> - What? - What? I-I can't.<eos> - You're doing it now. Jesús, take the wheel.<eos> He's terrified to be in the back. Now you're gonna put him in the front seat so that he can kill all of us?<eos> ! Can you not make this fear worse?<eos> I watched Dede coddle Mitchell when he was afraid of the dark.<eos> Till he was seven, he'd only blink one eye at a time...<eos> Gave a lot of girls a very wrong idea.<eos> Manny, you don't want to do this right?<eos> No, I really don't.
Pretty sure I failed as a father.<eos> No.<eos> That's how you see you.<eos> But that's not how I see you.<eos> How do you see me?<eos> I see... a kind, loving father.<eos> A gentleman.<eos> Wow. I think that's the first time that anyone has ever used the word "gentleman" to describe me.<eos> Well... that's 'cause they don't see you.<eos> But I do.
And how we had... - relations.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Stop it. Stop that!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> How the hell did you get video of that?<eos> That was a mistake. Which I stopped.<eos> I know that.<eos> But Julie doesn't.
And walked away from the fight.<eos> It didn't seem like my fight anymore.<eos> Something you learn when you're the one giving the orders:<eos> sometimes there are no good decisions.<eos> It's just a lesser of two evils.<eos> And from my seat, that's the best that you can do.<eos> Evil is still evil, General.<eos> Even when it's lesser.<eos> She thinks I killed her husband.<eos> Molly does.
She thinks I killed her husband.<eos> Molly does.<eos> So do I.<eos> He was my friend.<eos> Your friend that just happened to have an accident... while you were stealing his program out from underneath him.<eos> Seems awfully coincidental, don't you think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I don't believe in coincidences.<eos> But you do believe he was murdered.<eos> Yes, I do.
Baby girl...<eos> How could you?<eos> Wait!<eos> We do it and we do it now.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you saying, Julie?<eos> I'm saying I don't care what happens, I'm not making the wrong decision again.<eos> Shut the program down, Charlie.<eos> You realize we could go to jail for this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
About General Shepherd's death.<eos> What about it?<eos> Have you reviewed the preliminary reports?<eos> The explosion appears to have been generated from an outside source.<eos> Perhaps the hybrids launched another assault.<eos> But why would the hybrids kill Toby if he was helping them?<eos> If there's another player on the board, I need to know.<eos> Of course, but this brings up the question of your own safety,<eos> I have adequate security.<eos> As did General Shepherd.
He used to use zeroes and ones.<eos> Now, I couldn't understand it, but I had a program that can decode it.<eos> Well, black squares could be ones and white squares could be zeroes.<eos> - Simple.<eos> - Yeah, simple.<eos> Watch.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Hi.<eos> I thought you didn't understand this stuff.<eos> I didn't.
Yes.<eos> Were you gonna tell me or just... wait till my eyes lit up when I was shaving?<eos> What was I supposed to do, huh?<eos> Let you die?<eos> What's gonna happen to me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Am I gonna change?<eos> Am I gonna... turn into...<eos> Into what I am?<eos> What if you did?
Something's wrong.<eos> Molly, they're coming.<eos> The hybrids are down.<eos> How many?<eos> All of 'em.<eos> Which way, Molly?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This room was supposed to only have one doorway, not three.<eos> I thought you said you had this place memorized.<eos> I did.
Oh, God.<eos> Mike's leaving drinks.<eos> Promotion. Criminal Justice Unit. Haverford West.<eos> You knew.<eos> That's what she wanted to talk to you about.<eos> She was talking in riddles.<eos> She was upset.<eos> She called me that day and I said...<eos> "We'll talk in the morning", and I didn't think anything of it.<eos> I didn't, River.
A bit of Kabuki theater to impress a girl.<eos> Well, if I see Frank in Ohio, I'll be sure to send along your regards.<eos> What did he mean?<eos> What's a ménage à trois?<eos> I'm not trying to impress anyone.<eos> I was in a bind. Now I'm not.<eos> I think Frank helped me out and he's paying the price.<eos> And Oppenheimer won't tell you where he is?<eos> We're not even sure he knows.<eos> Well, somebody does.
No one can see you.<eos> Take a knee.<eos> Or did you change your mind about the transfer?<eos> Now... ask Jesus for forgiveness.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Jesus.<eos> Forgive me, Jesus.<eos> And what is the nature of your sin?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
It's a bluff.<eos> Now, I've heard it said that physics is a gentleman's sport.<eos> Some of you may think I'm hitting above my weight.<eos> _<eos> I'm 28 years old.<eos> I grew up in Missouri in a cold-water tenement.<eos> Red blood, not blue.<eos> My mother used to scrub it out of my school clothes.<eos> See, I had to learn to hit above my weight.<eos> We all do.
I mean, have there been other guys like me?<eos> You know, I mean, have you picked some fish guy to talk to the fish people on fish planet or something like that?<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I'm... I feel fine.<eos> Tired.<eos> I'm really tired.<eos> Pretty much been... been harvesting nonstop, you know, and Ellie and I are still trying to get pregnant.<eos> That's not going so well, plus the Rams have had a terrible start to their season, so this whole utopia thing's a bit of a debatable point in our house right now.<eos> You obviously didn't come here to talk about football.<eos> No, I didn't.
And what else do you see when you travel, Tom?<eos> An eye.<eos> A single giant eye.<eos> I see fire in the ground, smoke in the air.<eos> It blocks out the stars.<eos> You imagine this place?<eos> No, I go there.<eos> They take me there.<eos> Who do you think takes you there?<eos> They do.
I understand you had a visit from a healer.<eos> A woman dressed all in white?<eos> "a healer"?<eos> Yeah, well, that's what she called herself.<eos> My little paul there had a terrible fever.<eos> Physician said he was dying, nothing to be done.<eos> I even went to the convent to ask the nuns to pray for him.<eos> But he just got weaker.<eos> Then this woman came, said she could help.<eos> And did she?
I want to put 'em both in my mouth and then make a slapping sound on my bald head with 'em.<eos> We have a tranq gun if he gets rough.<eos> Meg, why are you home so early?<eos> Yeah, I thought you were doing your modeling thing.<eos> I was.<eos> But what... what's happening here?<eos> Well, not that it's any of your business, Meg, but this is why we've been married as long as we have.<eos> We do things together.<eos> You think 20 years just happens?<eos> No, it does not.
Shouldn't friendship be the foundation of a relationship?<eos> It should be the foundation of year two of a relationship and beyond, but right now, what I really wanna do is spend epic amounts of time naked with you, and the friendship will come.<eos> Would we even be together if we weren't both zombies?<eos> Probably not.<eos> My world was the music scene, you were an ER doctor.<eos> I suppose I could've OD'd, would have been a hell of a meet-cute, but what does it matter?<eos> Because here we are.<eos> Zombies together.<eos> It matters.<eos> It doesn't.
She's coming along nicely, don't you think, Miss Grimke?<eos> Oh.<eos> She still hasn't uttered a word.<eos> Yes, well, melancholia is a curious affliction.<eos> Three months ago, she was bedridden, remember? Of course.<eos> I didn't mean to suggest...<eos> Lenore's progress is slow, it's true.<eos> But it's steady, which is more important.<eos> Do you think she even knows I'm here?<eos> Of course she does.
Copy that.<eos> I will not forget to flush.<eos> We're with the Hazardous Utility Bureau.<eos> Question One, do you always take this long to open the gate during surprise inspections?<eos> Aren't you gonna be late?<eos> What's the point?<eos> I stink, like Bronko Kowalski's helmet.<eos> You heard what Hank said.<eos> The team needs you.<eos> No, they don't.
Oh, they have lights.<eos> I don't blame you. Yeah.<eos> So what's with all... this.<eos> Oh, the box was loose, so I figured I would fix it.<eos> You know that you don't have to do all this, right?<eos> Well, actually, you could've had some serious problems...<eos> Exposed wires, electrical fires. No.<eos> I mean being here with me.<eos> You know, if you have someplace else - you'd rather be...<eos> - I don't.
Sure you're doing ok?<eos> Mm-hmm. Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just now, I was supposed to put you into a category so I would know what to say to you, but then I realized I didn't know what category you would want to be put in, so, uh, I was thinking, "I guess there's no time<eos> "like the horribly inappropriate present to get to the bottom of that."<eos> I could list the categories if you like.<eos> Caroline, I, um...<eos> I-I want to talk to you about all this,<eos> I do, but...
New binder smell.<eos> Mm-mm. Amy don't do this.<eos> I'm gonna throw a milkshake in your face.<eos> This is nice. I feel like old people.<eos> Should we sit here?<eos> Jake, there's something I want to talk to you about.<eos> So, my boss hasn't been assigning me any of the good cases, and I found out it's because I'm dating a cop.<eos> What?<eos> Did he actually say that?<eos> No, but my colleagues did.
This changes everything. Imagine how deeply we can hurt the Batman. Break his heart and his will by killing this boy.<eos> He's supposed to take my place in the ritual. - He's...<eos> - You lied to me.<eos> Batman was right. - You were just using me to...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Shut up!<eos> I swear to you we'll find a replacement.<eos> Now, kill him!<eos> Yes, Grandmaster.<eos> Do it!
Mr. Stone worked for the military, Ms. Lane.<eos> This is purely routine.<eos> That a fact?<eos> I want to look around.<eos> I don't suppose I could dissuade you.<eos> This is a crime scene.<eos> I won't touch a thing.<eos> Your boyfriend has a lot of nerve.<eos> He's not my boyfriend.<eos> And yes, he does.
Look.<eos> And then what?<eos> And then nothing. We were both bleeding, so we just stopped.<eos> And that's when I realized that Justine was crazy and I was better off without her.<eos> So I left.<eos> With her very, very much alive and cussing at me the whole time.<eos> Dr. Fuentes!<eos> Excellent.<eos> I'm glad Dr. Saroyan was able to find you so quickly.<eos> She didn't.
Shut up!<eos> It's all coming back to me, Livvie poo.<eos> You know, the charge... Stop it, Kai!<eos> That races through your bones...<eos> Stop it!<eos> At the prospect of watching someone burn to death?<eos> I really missed that feeling.<eos> Just kill me, Kai.<eos> You already killed my best friend.<eos> So just do it.
Brenda couldn't have a baby.<eos> She wasn't pregnant!<eos> She was and she did.<eos> It was your wife... shotgun wound.<eos> - Had a baby. - No, she couldn't get pregnant!<eos> We tried! For years! We saw doctors.<eos> All of them said we couldn't.<eos> And Brenda was so... Sad.<eos> And mad, at herself, and at me 'cause we can't have a baby.<eos> You do.
God, Kit.<eos> What was that?<eos> I set my phone to get local alerts.<eos> Is it bad?<eos> It's bloody.<eos> All right, let's get out of here.<eos> He licked the blood off the floor?<eos> Yeah, the soda jockey back there seemed pretty shook up by it.<eos> Now, the description he gave -- medium build, brown hair -- that sound like the Kit you know?<eos> Yeah, it does.
Daniel!<eos> I was in a state.<eos> I didn't deserve to be his mum.<eos> Surely you can't be so conventional as to think there's only one way to bring up a child?<eos> We are both his mother.<eos> Neither one less nor more real than the other.<eos> I took care of his mind and she took care of his other needs.<eos> He didn't know?<eos> No.<eos> Except he did.
Is it a man ?<eos> What the hell!<eos> Did they see him exactly? And he is alive?<eos> When the body is floating towards the treatment plant.<eos> Do you know about the murder of a taxi driver?<eos> We would lay low and try not to attract someone's attention.<eos> Now you have the police after you!<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> I certainly hope so.<eos> You did something to me.
You...<eos> Did you just ask, "Do we have a case?"<eos> Ma'am, I wouldn't be here if there wasn't a case.<eos> I am your Beau.<eos> And "mont," as in you have a mont-umental case.<eos> That's not that good, is it?<eos> "Mon" as in... You have a monster case.<eos> How about "mont" as in... You have a case the size of Montana.<eos> These medical bills are going to be astronomical, and you probably don't have the resources to cover that, do you?<eos> No, we don't.
I'm Dr. Houchins.<eos> You stopped breathing on my watch. I won't be undefeated.<eos> All right, let's get you into a position to win.<eos> All right, take a deep breath.<eos> Don't give up now.<eos> Keep trying.<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> Do it now!<eos> Breathe!<eos> Do it!
All right, let's get you into a position to win.<eos> All right, take a deep breath.<eos> Don't give up now.<eos> Keep trying.<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> Do it now!<eos> Breathe!<eos> Do it!<eos> Cough, breathe and cough.<eos> Do it!
When did they renovate the Royal House?<eos> You from the area?<eos> Born and bred.<eos> I requested this detail.<eos> Been away from home too long.<eos> It looks like they have rolled out the red carpet for you, Agent Hackett.<eos> Why are we stopping?<eos> The admiral nixed secondary entry.<eos> He insists we go through the front.<eos> Of course he did.
Hello?<eos> Mr. Bishop?<eos> Why does it take you eight rings to answer?<eos> Uh, I was in court, sir.<eos> - Uh, do you need something?<eos> - I do. The favor.<eos> The one you owe me.<eos> Yeah, uh, look, if this has anything to do with Florrick-Agos, we could always just bill it<eos> - through the firm. - No.<eos> It doesn't.
- Instruct me.<eos> - The name of the murdered wife is Carolyn.<eos> The name of the murderer is Colin.<eos> The name of the detective is Rick Crowell.<eos> These are all the names of the real people in the Colin Sweeney case.<eos> I am outraged, Your Honor.<eos> Well, you're welcome to your outrage, Ms. Krause, but I am inclined to decide that the plaintiff has proved likeness.<eos> I believe that this episode, though fictionalized, does defame Mr. Sweeney.<eos> Unless you have something else.<eos> I do.
He's quite a character, isn't he: Redmayne?<eos> He is.<eos> A bit provocative?<eos> I guess.<eos> My campaign manager is angry.<eos> Why's that?<eos> He thinks Redmayne was in my column and then he wasn't.<eos> After he spoke to you.<eos> - That happens.<eos> - Yes, it does.
Don't be scared.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to help you.<eos> I want to protect you from Liam.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> If you can find me, so can he.<eos> You can't keep running.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
I don't know why he's not dying, too.<eos> Did Julianna use the same serum on him?<eos> No, but it had some of the same properties.<eos> Which is why I assume he could do what he could do.<eos> And yourself?<eos> Are you...<eos> What, superhuman?<eos> I wish.<eos> How much do you know about Liam?<eos> Only as much as Julianna did and for the same reason:
If he thinks that you're on his side.<eos> Something like that.<eos> Look, Catherine, he doesn't know us, okay?<eos> He doesn't know how far we've come, okay?<eos> Otherwise, he would never think he had a chance.<eos> So this gives us the advantage, okay?<eos> Liam thinks that he is playing me, but in reality, I will be playing him.<eos> Look, just trust me, okay?<eos> Trust us.<eos> I do.
But Liam is luring Vincent.<eos> It's so hard not to worry.<eos> He has never been tested like this before.<eos> Well, bright side, what better way to find out you're really past all of it once and for all? ♪ She said a diamond wouldn't hurt... ♪<eos> And game.<eos> You used beast vision.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yeah, your eyes glowed.<eos> I saw 'em.<eos> No, they did not.
What am I supposed to do?<eos> Just stick with the plan, it's already in motion, right?<eos> Get the gem, assemble SWAT, and we'll capture Liam the moment he comes out of DHS.<eos> This will blow up in our faces if Helen Ellingsworth can still protect Liam.<eos> She won't.<eos> Liam is not her relative and I am going to prove it.<eos> We'll have two minutes before they circle back.<eos> You did your homework.<eos> Got a lot at stake.<eos> We both do.
She went to go see JT.<eos> I want to make sure she's okay. Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Why would you hide this from me?<eos> I didn't want to worry you.<eos> Bull.<eos> Go on, tell me why.<eos> I guess I just don't want to be weak around you, okay?<eos> I don't.
It's unrealistic to think about children.<eos> Not now.<eos> It's unrealistic.<eos> - Clark?<eos> - [ Sighs ] It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I just needed to know.<eos> And now I do.
I did what I had to do to keep working with you.<eos> If he could identify me, there was no other way.<eos> And no one saw you? - No.<eos> - You're sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You all right?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It was, uh... messy.<eos> It didn't go exactly as planned.<eos> It seldom does.
Between what I did to Charlie --<eos> Charlie forgave you.<eos> How about you forgive yourself?<eos> Because I'm not exactly batting 1,000 here, you know?<eos> Yeah, I do know that, but staying locked up in here, sitting on the ground reading the same lore books over and over and over again, it's not helping you.<eos> You need to get back in the game for your own good.<eos> You can beat this, Dean.<eos> Do you really believe that? Yeah, you're damn right I believe that.<eos> You know, you also believed in the Easter Bunny till you were 12.<eos> No, I didn't.
You smelled flowers?<eos> What kind of flowers?<eos> Flowery flowers.<eos> Flowery flowers.<eos> Look.<eos> We all know what's going on here, okay?<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Aliens.<eos> He said it.<eos> Yeah, he did.
You have to take a look at this.<eos> He's the real deal.<eos> Vaudeville?<eos> Ha ha! This?<eos> George, we are hanging on by our fingernails.<eos> Now, it's time to get creative and look beyond Oxford and Cambridge.<eos> We need people like him.<eos> - Failed basic training.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it bloody does!
And they'll want to know about Hallie.<eos> And they'll break me, too.<eos> Shames me, but it's true.<eos> There's a record where you hit an A over high C.<eos> Pure and perfect.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Creole Hot July.<eos> But I can't hit that note no more.<eos> Most people never touch greatness.<eos> You did.
Tell me what to do.<eos> What do I do?<eos> Danielle?<eos> Danielle!<eos> Danielle!<eos> What do I do?<eos> You're bleeding!<eos> You're bleeding too fast!<eos> I didn't... I didn't ask for any of this, you know.<eos> You lot never do.
It has to be this way.<eos> (man): I'm here!<eos> You can't let them take me alive... _<eos> I'm here!<eos> _<eos> _<eos> - Count of three, we fire.<eos> - No.<eos> - You don't need him alive.<eos> - Yes, we do.
I stopped believing in this war a long time ago.<eos> There's a lot more he could tell us, if he wanted to.<eos> Is that true?<eos> Your pencil?<eos> Five platoons... repositioning near Rouen next week.<eos> There are U-boats, here, moving south<eos> - in the Mediterranean.<eos> - If it checks out.<eos> Which we have no way of knowing if it will.<eos> Yes, you don't.
Look at her like you've never known a woman like her before and never will again.<eos> Tell her... from the moment you saw her your definition of "stunning" changed.<eos> You know, from the moment I saw you... my definition of "stunning" changed.<eos> Perfect.<eos> What's taking so long? Open it.<eos> I can't.<eos> She booby-trapped it.<eos> We open this, an alarm will notify her.<eos> We have no other way in.<eos> Actually, we do.
We must keep my illness a secret for as long as possible. To put the pieces in place.<eos> I can't think about politics right now.<eos> You don't need to.<eos> I have.<eos> I will protect you and France.<eos> Stop being so strong, so perfect. Worrying about me when you...<eos> When we...<eos> I don't know how much time we have left.<eos> But every moment matters.<eos> It always did, I just didn't...
Aces.<eos> All right, let's gear up.<eos> That might be tricky.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> - Dean...<eos> - We made a promise.<eos> To do what?<eos> Charge out there, guns blazing?<eos> We don't even know how to kill them.<eos> She does.
Last season, on "The Flash"...<eos> What's happening to me?<eos> I wasn't the only one affected, was I?<eos> We've been searching for other meta-humans, like yourself. Don't be afraid, Cisco.<eos> You were affected, too.<eos> Once upon a time, you agreed to marry me.<eos> Yes, I did.
Anyone see him leave?<eos> Yeah, i saw him leave. He went after bella.<eos> Is she here?<eos> No, haven't seen her today.<eos> Is this bella? - Yes.<eos> - Yeah, that's her.<eos> Bella turner.<eos> What was zack's relationship with bella?<eos> I don't think he had one.<eos> Nobody does with her.
All passengers report immediately to the casino on the main deck.<eos> No, that's not good. Thank you.<eos> Put the ship into idle.<eos> That's no coincidence.<eos> They can't find us, so they're going after the passengers.<eos> Please, keep coming in.<eos> Yes, that's it.<eos> Just this way, folks.<eos> That's right, right in here. Do you think Chaz would find this odd?<eos> Not sure, but I certainly do.
No, of course not-- we were rivals.<eos> Rivals?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> Well, with Troy out of the picture, it's your tournament to lose.<eos> Sounds like a motive to me.<eos> You don't own a rifle, do you, Mr. Scruggs?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Everyone around here does.
His first victims were single, but his last two were married.<eos> This escalation indicates that he may be married himself and probably has a family.<eos> This unsub's M.O. takes patience and caution and is firmly rooted in a need-based desire, which means he won't be stopping anytime soon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Meg, you deserve whatever reaction, but hurting yourself, it's not ok.<eos> But grounding me for a month on top of taking my phone away is ok?<eos> Since when did this house turn into some sort of a gulag?<eos> Ahem. I know that this is a huge adjustment.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
Your emotions are the reason that I've been able to watch you all these years.<eos> Do you understand what you've done, Logan?<eos> Do you?<eos> Hmm? I did this for you, for us.<eos> This is where we began, and this is where we're going to end.<eos> It's carbon monoxide poisoning.<eos> I bet that you thought that you have to be in, like, oh, a small, enclosed space, like a... a car, right, for it to kill you.<eos> No, it just takes a little bit in the air, and you're dead.<eos> You think, because you outweigh me, it ensures that I'll die before you?<eos> But what if I don't?
What?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause I got a package for her.<eos> She texted me. She said that she had to see her mom or something.<eos> So what was so important you couldn't tell me over the phone?<eos> Okay, Erin...<eos> Is this about Teddy?<eos> Teddy?<eos> No, no, no. Nothing to do with Teddy.
While I was sleeping on it, Max.<eos> Well, blame me. I got her drunk.<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> Look, girls, I got your pussy in my purse.<eos> Either that's a cat, or you two got to keep better track of your belongings.<eos> Yay! That cat's back.<eos> See, Max?<eos> I am excited.<eos> [baby talk] Oh, I missed you so much.<eos> Oh, yes, I did.
Yeah, I've seen Pretty Woman.<eos> That's how I realized I wasn't charging enough.<eos> Go, Max, here he comes.<eos> All right, but I'll be watching inside from the window.<eos> It's probably better, because I don't trust Nancy alone with those kittens.<eos> She's got some serious postpartum.<eos> When I left the room, she was lighting a Menthol 100 with a shaky paw.<eos> Hi.<eos> Crazy we live walking distance from each other.<eos> We don't.
So where is the simulation?<eos> A couple of floors below us, and that's easier said than done.<eos> In order to mimic conditions on Mars as well as discourage any cheating, the simulation is filled with noxious gas.<eos> Right, it won't kill you, but it will induce severe nausea and a rash.<eos> It would take several days to vent the sim to make the air breathable, so if you want to go in, you're gonna need to wear space suits.<eos> Best case ever!<eos> This way?<eos> What can you tell us about the victim?<eos> Well, Tom Richwood was the mission pilot.<eos> Former Navy top gun, did a tour with NASA.
Ask her where you are.<eos> M.I.R.A., where are we?<eos> You are aboard the vessel tensing norgay in the northern lowlands of Mars.<eos> She actually thinks she's on Mars.<eos> Regardless, I'm gonna need to ask all of you to join me at the precinct so I can interview you properly.<eos> That... could be a problem.<eos> I'm sorry, detective.<eos> I can't let you remove the astronauts.<eos> I don't have that kind of authority.<eos> - Well, then, who does?
Was it Tom?<eos> No.<eos> Not Tom.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What?<eos> Angela?<eos> I didn't say who it was in my letter.<eos> Maybe he thought it was Tom.<eos> Did he have reason to?<eos> Yeah, he did.
And what's that gonna accomplish?<eos> He'll drop his guard, he'll have no idea I'm coming after him.<eos> The only time that apex predators are the most vulnerable is right after their prey has been killed.<eos> What the hell are you talking about, apex predators?<eos> How do we know you're not just making all this crap up to trick us into exonerating you from all the monstrous things you've done?<eos> It was all for the greater good.<eos> Oh, says who, you?<eos> Every one of these cases were handled outside the law, which makes them against the law.<eos> Liam doesn't give a damn about the law.<eos> But I do!
- Like what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> They say they've been sending us signs and no one's listening.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> We have to tell people.<eos> What, that you hear dead people, that something bad is gonna happen?<eos> How is that gonna work?<eos> They'll think I'm crazy.<eos> No one will believe me.<eos> I do.
You're my sister.<eos> That's who you are.<eos> Oh, you're a hungry little fella, aren't you?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> I, um...<eos> - I-I need to talk to a cop.<eos> - About what, sir?<eos> Just... I need to tell them something about some things I know, about some... about some crimes.<eos> All right, well, you go and sit down, and as soon as one of our police officers is available...<eos> No, no, I don't...
You seem like a nice man.<eos> Why would you lie to all those people?<eos> Promising them an afterlife you can't possibly know exists?<eos> And you can't know it doesn't.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Want to bet?<eos> Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen.<eos> Whatever that means.<eos> So, you really believe that people rise from the dead?<eos> Yes, I do.
- What about Enos?<eos> - When that son of a bitch shows his face, I'll make him wish he stayed in hell.<eos> - You used to sit outside with me at night, taught me the constellations.<eos> - [chuckles] -ThinkaboutGrace.<eos> She'srareandshe needs tobeprotected.<eos> - I'm not afraid of Enos.<eos> - If you knew him, you would be!<eos> -Sowe 'reclear, David'smine.<eos> - I don't mean to cause any trouble.<eos> - Girls like you never do.
Just keep being out of breath.<eos> One good thing is that I've let go of any dream of getting in great shape, like, it's like a relief.<eos> Just 'cause- My whole life I've been like, well, someday, I should really get in great shape.<eos> Now, I'm like, what? Why would I do that?<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Just- To me, the bar, the level I wanna reach as far as the shape I'm in, I just want it to be so that if you find out that I died, you ask "What happened?"<eos> That's all.<eos> I want you to wonder what happened.<eos> I don't want it to be like, "Oh, he died?"<eos> Oh, yeah, well, sure. Sure he did.

- Hey, you went out with a bang.<eos> Maybe it's for the best.<eos> That's what Loeb said.<eos> I should've walked away.<eos> I just hate to quit.<eos> You didn't quit.<eos> You were fired.<eos> Oh, there's things I can do.<eos> I thought you said you didn't have any legal moves left.<eos> I don't.
Excellent.<eos> I'm so sorry things got messy.<eos> What a foolish fellow.<eos> Never mind.<eos> I will make sure that there's no follow-up from your colleagues.<eos> Don't worry about a thing. You knew.<eos> You knew Ogden would go off.<eos> What a devious mind you have. I had no idea.<eos> We have a deal.<eos> We do.

And the bastard was intent on leaving Victoria everything.<eos> I starved him until he had no choice but to pick up the damn pen and sign the new will.<eos> So why come after me?<eos> Aww, honey.<eos> Conrad always wanted me to live like a Grayson, and that's not just about the money.<eos> It's about the power...<eos> The power to make people believe anything you want.<eos> Ruining you was among his greatest accomplishments.<eos> So you want the world to hate me.<eos> Conrad did.
Likewise.<eos> Gin and tonic, please, governor.<eos> Ice and a slice.<eos> Nice place.<eos> It is.<eos> Been here before, then, have you?<eos> It's my regular spot.<eos> Oh, right, you're a local.<eos> Don't I know you?<eos> Do you?
No, no.<eos> My dibs.<eos> This is a waste of time.<eos> We had a deal, didn't we, Master Bruce.<eos> Part of which was you resume your normal lifestyle.<eos> Your parents were both patrons to the Children's Hospital.<eos> Therefore, it makes you a patron.<eos> Besides... there's gonna be a magician.<eos> And you like magicians, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.
Previously on Gotham...<eos> My forefathers were betrayed, their legacy erased, and I am here to punish those who wronged us.<eos> - We have a deal?<eos> - We do.
I've learned that the hard way, too.<eos> And did you even get a lead while you were out avenging Luke?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - No, sir?<eos> Well, you got one now.<eos> Bodega owner called this in.<eos> His security camera caught it.<eos> She's our firefly.<eos> We don't know who the other one is.<eos> I do.
I am.<eos> I've just decided... I'm gonna start with you.<eos> Dangerous words... when addressing the man who now controls this city.<eos> Desperate times.<eos> They are, indeed.<eos> I want to know why you did this.<eos> When Dr. Thompkins walked in the room, how did it feel?<eos> I was terrified.<eos> She could have discovered the body.<eos> But she didn't.
Press 56, please?<eos> You live here?<eos> No.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Lady's baby grand is flat, so...<eos> I don't mind making house calls.<eos> I like my work.<eos> You like your work?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
You can try and run, but with your condition, you'll get about three blocks.<eos> I'm afraid that you're stuck here until you recover.<eos> Now, drink up.<eos> It's just water.<eos> Dehydration is common after prolonged outdoor exposure.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Remember I had mentioned fate?<eos> Recently, I've been going through a sort of change.<eos> "What kind of change?" you ask.<eos> - I didn't.
Please. I promise.<eos> But my uncle didn't tell me anything.<eos> But you left me a message.<eos> I was supposed to keep you busy till this evening.<eos> He's sure he's going to be freed.<eos> Then he'll convince you to sell your company.<eos> I'm sorry, Bruce.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I don't!
You knew, from the start, that this was a trap.<eos> But you thought, "Hey,<eos> "let the bad guys take their best shot.<eos> "I'm Jim Gordon.<eos> "I'll find a way to win."<eos> "Or die."<eos> It's option B, baby.<eos> Your fondest wish come true.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> Hey. Sure you do.
- What? - So I pepper sprayed him.<eos> You're a good man, Charles.<eos> How can I ever thank you?<eos> Start taking care of yourself again.<eos> I miss those gross, overly large muscles.<eos> Lay off my body, dude.<eos> I clearly got some stuff to work through.<eos> Chief Garmin, thanks for meeting with me. So I have a guy in custody on an attempted B and E.<eos> You scheduled a meeting with the chief of detectives to tell me that?<eos> I did.
Ooh, that's actually amazing.<eos> - Charles, write that down.<eos> - Already did.<eos> Sarge, what's the big deal?<eos> We stopped two kilos of heroin from hitting the streets.<eos> Who cares about one broken window?<eos> I do!<eos> I'm the one who has to spend all weekend doing paperwork because of your dumb stunt.<eos> But... Terry loves paperwork?<eos> - No, Jake, I do not.
Canadian?<eos> No!<eos> You're so clearly supposed to be German.<eos> - Are any of you German?<eos> Mm-mm.<eos> - Russian?<eos> Mm-mm. - North Korean? - Mm-mm.<eos> Greek?<eos> I don't trust the way the Greeks dance.<eos> No one does.
- Why didn't you just kill me?<eos> - Because we're not like you, Julianna.<eos> - We don't just kill people.<eos> - Who are you kidding?<eos> - Liam sent you.<eos> - Who is Liam?<eos> Is that who you're talking about?<eos> The guy you think we're working for?<eos> You really don't know who he is, do you?<eos> No, we don't.
- Yeah, just the orchids.<eos> Just hope we don't run into any wedding guest cops wondering what we're doing here so late.<eos> Let's just get in and out before anybody starts asking any questions.<eos> - Yeah, agreed.<eos> - All right.<eos> Hey, actually, can I ask you a question?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Why'd you and J.T. break up?<eos> - He wasn't supposed to tell you.<eos> - He didn't.
- I'll tell you on the way.<eos> Berlin!<eos> - What the hell are you doing?<eos> - She killed Tommy!<eos> A machine killed Tommy!<eos> You lay a hand on her again, and I don't care who you are, I will put you in the ground.<eos> That hardware always been there?<eos> No, it's new.<eos> Thought you said no one was home at the mines.<eos> I did.
Blood trail comes in from behind us.<eos> She went this way.<eos> Must've reopened her gunshot wounds when she escaped.<eos> I don't like the amount of blood I'm seeing here.<eos> How do you think I feel?<eos> So let's go find her.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Do you need a doctor?<eos> She needs a doctor!<eos> No, she doesn't!
Alright.<eos> Take us in.<eos> You should know, weapons are prohibited on the station.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Let's meet in the airlock in twenty minutes.<eos> Don't forget your comms.<eos> You find anything worth selling?<eos> No.<eos> Okay well-if you do...
Brother, what is this?<eos> Where are they taking your things?<eos> Where do you think?<eos> The ship leaves tonight.<eos> What ship?<eos> You remember when you made this for me, that time we went to the beach?<eos> I couldn't have been more than six or seven years old.<eos> I remember. It's funny to think that I kept it all these years.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I do.
Umm she's working on shoring up the recycling system.<eos> I told her if it means drinking other people's urine than I'd rather die of dehydration.<eos> You're fine with drinking your own though?<eos> Gotta draw the line somewhere.<eos> Look, the uhh, the bottom line is she's doing the best she can, but this bucket needs more work than one android can handle.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You can turn around now.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Uhh yeah, we have a damaged relationship.<eos> Do we?
Amen.<eos> You guys got anything?<eos> Yeah it's in the case over there.<eos> Don't worry about it, it's not where I keep the good stuff.<eos> No drinking.<eos> Ohhhh! No drinking.<eos> Hey, what's your problem?<eos> We need to toast this momentous occasion in our relationship, do we not?<eos> No.<eos> We do not.
I feel you.<eos> Hey, girl, can I just ask you, what's up with your outfit?<eos> My therapist says I had a traumatic experience that kept part of my psyche forever trapped in the '90s.<eos> But I'm, like, uh, I'll take it.<eos> And then there's those two.<eos> God knows what they're talking about, basic bitches.<eos> What fresh hell is this?<eos> Chanel, I'd like to introduce you to Jennifer.<eos> I'm sorry, Kappa doesn't participate in the Make-a-Wish Foundation.<eos> Oh, but you do now.
♪ It's all about you... ♪ Hi, Susan.<eos> For you.<eos> ♪ You... ♪ Thank you so... much!<eos> You're the most important person in the world.<eos> I would do anything... for you, Chanel.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> ♪ You are a star... ♪<eos> ♪ Bright... ♪<eos> So you didn't see anyone in a Red Devil costume entering or leaving the house?<eos> No, sir, I did not.
Will you stop whining about Dodger? !<eos> Everybody agrees that dude was holding you back.<eos> Nobody misses him.<eos> Now let's play some Truth or Dare and find out who the killer is.<eos> Number Five, truth or dare?<eos> Truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> Number Five, does your vagina have teeth?<eos> That's insane.<eos> No, it doesn't, Chanel.
I would be opening myself up to a lot of trouble if I were to turn you in to the authorities.<eos> It doesn't do any of us any good to start accusing each other with no evidence.<eos> But it is pretty suspicious that you're the one who found her, Hester.<eos> Okay, I understand.<eos> I suggest that we just have someone stand guard and watch me for the rest of the night, or until someone else dies, therefore proving that I am not the killer.<eos> I nominate Chad.<eos> Screw that, Evil Harrington.<eos> We're locking you upstairs in my closet until we can find a way out of here.<eos> This feels so good.<eos> Yeah, it does.
I mean, I went to jail because of you!<eos> I'm so sorry, Chanel.<eos> I promise to never betray your trust again.<eos> You most certainly won't betray my trust ever again, because you will never have my trust ever again!<eos> Look, we think you need to contact Number Two, and just give her a chance to do right by you.<eos> What the hell are you talking about? !<eos> How? !<eos> Well, I found this old talking board in the basement.<eos> Those things don't work!<eos> Yes, they do.
And when you bring back the dirt on her, then I'll tell you about the little baby.<eos> Lunchtime.<eos> Really?<eos> Nurse, I specifically told you I cannot eat deli meats.<eos> The sulfites in them send me into anaphylactic shock.<eos> No salami and certainly no bologna!<eos> Really!<eos> It's a lawsuit!<eos> So do we have an agreement?<eos> We do.
I paint them all.<eos> We are murderers hell-bent on revenge.<eos> Tell me what happened to the baby.<eos> Come to my office, alone.<eos> Well? "Well" what?<eos> You scheduled this meeting;<eos> that means you talk first and I do my best to try to pretend to listen.<eos> You know why I'm here.<eos> You told me if I helped you get out of that asylum, you'd tell me what happened to the baby in the bathtub.<eos> Did I?
I'm just telling the story.<eos> The Red Cloak waits until you run out of toilet paper.<eos> And then he makes you choose the red roll or the blue roll.<eos> If you pick the red roll, he'll slit your throat!<eos> And the blood will run up, and look like you're wearing a red cloak.<eos> But if you pick the blue roll, he will strangle you until you turn blue.<eos> And it'll look like you're wearing a blue cloak.<eos> The... end.<eos> I know y'all feel better now.<eos> No, we don't.
Don't tell me you're fine.<eos> I know you're not.<eos> Hollis, it's late.<eos> It's your fault Diane's dead.<eos> That's what you're thinking.<eos> I'm not wrong.<eos> You didn't pull the trigger.<eos> I put her in the crosshairs.<eos> He wanted to make it personal!<eos> Still does.
-He was making $10,000 a day. -Yeah.<eos> Was yours a cream pie?<eos> - No, mine wasn't a cream pie.<eos> - Mine was.<eos> It was just a "he came on my stomach" type thing.<eos> Today I did two cream pies, but all I did was just...<eos> I went to Walgreens, got the Plan B pill, so...<eos> I thought they gave you extra for that. Didn't they?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Yeah, they did. Yeah.
It hurts now.<eos> Like, every time I see a porno, I'm like, "That's someone's girlfriend," or, "That's someone's daughter."<eos> - You want to do shots?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Do you want shot glasses?<eos> I can grab 'em...<eos> I wanted to get the fuck out of there.<eos> It pisses me off because everyone knows that you were getting almost punish-fucked for money.<eos> It's like you're supposed to have respect for yourself, too.<eos> I do.
He hates it, Mom.<eos> -Trust me, he hates it. -Okay.<eos> And I want her to stop.<eos> But, I mean, like, I don't...<eos> I also don't want to hold it against her and, like, not be with her because of that.<eos> -It's, like, it was a bad choice in life. -Okay.<eos> Well, guess what?<eos> Her dad doesn't know.<eos> -Doesn't?<eos> -No, he doesn't.
You're killing friendlies!<eos> Do it again!<eos> Get it right!<eos> Again.<eos> Come on.<eos> Eyes down range.<eos> Acquire and fire.<eos> Go!<eos> Too slow.<eos> Do it again.
As I said before, I won, and then I cashed out.<eos> And what did you have again?<eos> A queen-high flush. And who did you beat?<eos> I told you, I didn't get his name.<eos> Okay, so what did he have?<eos> Two pair, queens over sixes.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You said before that the man next to you folded with two queens up, and now this guy has two queens, and you had a queen-high flush?<eos> I said that the man next to me folded with two kings.<eos> No, you didn't.
I stopped cooking, working and eating.<eos> For the first time in my life I had no desire to read.<eos> I even stopped thinking about Chekura.<eos> I am in the mood for dying.<eos> You have to live, girl.<eos> You will live.<eos> Find your way home, Aminata.<eos> I remember you from last year.<eos> You had letters for abolitionists.<eos> Yes, yes I did.
A position easily gained.<eos> But held?<eos> For decades?<eos> Say it was an accident, mother, please.<eos> Say that you only left those nursery windows open To get the nanny dismissed, to keep your hold on the king.<eos> I would like to say that.<eos> I would.<eos> I wanted catherine to suffer.<eos> I wanted henry to suffer.<eos> They did.
Got my tablet back today.<eos> You know, I had all my photos in there and my family stuff.<eos> It was good to see my parents again.<eos> I haven't seen them since the trial.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Well, Sifter and I spoke to the judge.<eos> She agreed to lift your probation.<eos> Wow, that's-that's crazy.<eos> I didn't, I didn't even know he liked me.<eos> No, he-he doesn't.
Oh, you know, I miss my favorite poker buddy.<eos> And...<eos> And a question about blind spots.<eos> What would happen if I wanted to sneak into the Consulate<eos> - without being seen? - You couldn't.<eos> There are no blind spots.<eos> Cameras cover everything.<eos> What gives?<eos> Well, last week at the reception when Yussef Khalid allegedly entered the building...<eos> But didn't.
I think we all needed that.<eos> And besides, we don't need cell phones.<eos> We have a--<eos> Elevator phone!<eos> Cyril, try that.<eos> I am, if you'd shut up.<eos> Oh, gross!<eos> This phone is all sticky.<eos> Yeah, mine at home gets bad sticky.<eos> Ew. Of course it does.
You are the man who used that truck to steal two zebras from this facility.<eos> And when their delivery did not go as you had hoped, you're very likely the man who murdered<eos> Dr. David Chang in cold blood. No, no, you're crazy.<eos> I didn't have...<eos> Detective Bell, could I speak to you over here for a moment?<eos> Would you just...<eos> One second.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You didn't tell me you had a suspect.<eos> I don't.
Dr. David Chang in cold blood. No, no, you're crazy.<eos> I didn't have...<eos> Detective Bell, could I speak to you over here for a moment?<eos> Would you just...<eos> One second.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You didn't tell me you had a suspect.<eos> I don't.<eos> Or I didn't when I started talking.<eos> I do now.
No, you can't go.<eos> What?<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, you know how y-you think - that you're their boss and their friend? - Uh-huh.<eos> You're one of those things.<eos> Oh, my God. They hate me.<eos> No. Lots of people like you.<eos> Like who?<eos> Uh, well, me.<eos> I do. - Yeah?
In fact, he's there with her right now.<eos> Not the one on Barrington.<eos> 'Cause there's an unsnipped chow always tries to hump her silly. Oh, hi, Mr. Pritchett.<eos> Hey, Lucy.<eos> Lucy likes you.<eos> Hey, Claire, check out my new shirt.<eos> I have you to thank.<eos> Oh, no, that's all you.<eos> You were supposed to talk to her - about storing those zeppelins in a hangar.<eos> - I did!

Louder.
I think you dropped one.<eos> Oh, well, thank you, Your majesty.<eos> Well, it'd be a shame to lose track Of something so vibrant and beautiful.<eos> Please excuse me, your majesty.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Not a quarry to pursue.<eos> She's married.<eos> Forgive me, I appear to have lost my hearing.<eos> Since when did you acquire the moral high ground When it came to married women?<eos> I didn't.
Mary.<eos> I only just started work here in the palace, but I know Joanna from...<eos> From the market.<eos> We used to see each other at the market.<eos> Didn't we agree you need to tell me about any new friends?<eos> My wife has come under some bad influences recently.<eos> I don't want it to happen again.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Your husband doesn't know about your faith?<eos> He does.
Why hasn't Barnabas already to...<eos> I want to hear it from your mouth.<eos> Peter, we need to start planning...<eos> You are going to tell me everything from the beginning.<eos> But I am your brother in Christ.<eos> From the beginning.<eos> It was like I'd always been blind, but now I saw for the very first time.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> - You wanted me dead.<eos> - I did.
We can only plan for its arrival.<eos> I know.<eos> I feel the same.<eos> But that's all we can do.<eos> We must reinforce the Garrison.<eos> I can't believe you.<eos> This could be the end of the temple.<eos> How can you stand by and...<eos> How can you not want Jesus to return?<eos> I do.

It has to be.<eos> Beckett, will you please just check Scott's alibi?<eos> Would you do that for me?<eos> I will.<eos> But listen to me.<eos> Eva was your friend.<eos> She came here to this very office and asked for your help, and now she's dead, and you feel responsible, and that can make you see ghosts.<eos> Wait, we're looking into Scott Galloway now?<eos> Why? I thought everything pointed to Cole Whitfield being the killer.<eos> It does.
What time is it there?<eos> Are you OK?<eos> Oh, yeah, it's 4am and I couldn't sleep, so I finally looked up this thing on the internet and you do not have to stay there, it's a different country.<eos> They can't extradite you for failure to pay child support.<eos> It's not like it's a war crime.<eos> It's just a foreign baby.<eos> It's not a foreign baby.<eos> It's my baby. Your grandson.<eos> I'm a dad, so I can, at the very least, give it a shot.<eos> Your father didn't.
The full story will have to wait, since we have more pressing issues.<eos> A D.U.I. with a child in the car...<eos> Is a felony.<eos> I know.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> We're gonna fight it.<eos> But I need to know... Were you drinking?<eos> I didn't have a drop.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> I do.
A thousand times yes!<eos> A resounding a-yes.<eos> Ain't she something?<eos> Oh, what did I just do there?<eos> Oh, I guess I just turned into a southern gentleman.<eos> Oh, Milly, where's my mint julep?<eos> Every year, on the first day of camp, the counselors perform a Broadway musicale.<eos> And this year, we're presenting the explosive Broadway hit, Electro-City!<eos> Electro-City is the story of a young man who moves from the country to the city to become a Broadway star and is immediately sent to the electric chair for a crime he did not commit.<eos> Or did he?
Oh, awesome!<eos> Like in temple on Rosh Hashanah!<eos> Gonna have to work on that.<eos> Well, you have a few more months till Rosh.<eos> The shofar symbolizes many different things.<eos> Like strength and joy.<eos> Love.<eos> Coop, it feels really good to speak my truth with you.<eos> You have really great arms.<eos> - I do?
No deal.<eos> This isn't about the money, Martinson.<eos> This is about giving a group of young people in Waterville, Maine, a summer filled with laughter and fun, without dying from radioactive poison in the ground.<eos> Or maybe you've forgotten what it's like to be young, Bill?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I enjoyed the speech, Jim... and if you're ever on the lecture circuit,<eos> I'll be sure to get some tickets for me and my friends, but as for tonight, I'm getting kind of hungry.<eos> We have a deal or not?<eos> Nah.<eos> We do not.
You pulled it off.<eos> Hey, why don't you drop by the club on Sunday?<eos> We could use a fourth.<eos> Sorry, Martinson, I won't be able to make it.<eos> I'm busy that day.<eos> Well played, Jim.<eos> Well played.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - You did it.
I wanna know why you're so mad at me!<eos> Because you said that that kiss on stage tonight was just acting.<eos> Well, it wasn't for me.<eos> For me, it was real.<eos> Those weren't Billy the Convict from Indiana's lips kissing your lips on stage tonight.<eos> Those were Andy's lips. Those were my lips.<eos> And don't even try and tell me that those were hard-nosed Electro-City DA,<eos> Pamela Needlehoffer's lips kissing my lips, those were Katie's lips, A.K.A. your lips.<eos> The only reason that I said that I was acting was because you said you were acting first!<eos> - No, I didn't!
Norwest here is a murderous son of a bitch Who owns the tribal police. Now, if you want my opinion --<eos> My client was kidnapped at gunpoint from indian land, Shot at by a civilian.<eos> There is no warrant for his arrest and no probable cause To hold him.<eos> I do not appreciate being interrupted.<eos> [ scoffs ] where are we?<eos> Deadwood?<eos> Norwest is a person of interest In a homicide investigation in portland, your honor.<eos> You got a warrant?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
What do you have now, 50 million?<eos> But that's not my personal money.<eos> They don't understand that.<eos> We're dealing with someone who's not too sophisticated.<eos> Yet this kidnapping was just the opposite.<eos> It's not adding up.<eos> Benjy, can't we borrow against your campaign fund? No.<eos> No, that's illegal.<eos> I... i don't know what to do anymore.<eos> I do.
Where's Calvin?<eos> Where? Nick!<eos> Where?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Just...<eos> It's my fault.<eos> Calvin must have gone looking for him.<eos> We don't know what we're dealing with here, Maddy.<eos> We don't know.<eos> I do.
I'd tell you about myself, but I'm sure you'll have my records soon enough.<eos> Top of class Yale, Georgetown Law, Deputy Secretary to the U.N. Human Rights Council,<eos> Director of International Affairs...<eos> For another day, Mr. Dodd.<eos> In my hand is a jump drive.<eos> You'll download the details to our next case while in transit to RAC.<eos> Rocketry Aeronautics Center.<eos> Yes. Your team is uniquely qualified because as reacquired government assets, you can be held to strict confidentiality, whereas private RAC contractors cannot.<eos> Further, you have intimate knowledge of Russian aerospace engineering.<eos> No, we don't.
Thank you.<eos> Ah, damn it, now I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> So, how you doing?<eos> Here we go.<eos> Thanks again for seeing me.<eos> It's very kind of you.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Is this Alvin? Yes.<eos> I didn't know he wanted to be cremated.<eos> He didn't.
- Hm. - What's all this?<eos> - Oh, I'm busy reinventing myself.<eos> I'm being reinvented, too.<eos> I rather like the old models.<eos> Don't you think Carson's behaviour was rather odd at dinner?<eos> He hasn't been himself for ages.<eos> Should we go down now and see what it's all about?<eos> There is no treatment, there is no cure.<eos> But I'm sorry if Lady Mary saw fit to trouble you with it, my lord.<eos> She didn't.
I wasn't trying to manipulate you, but I did need to know where that sub was.<eos> Now I know it's damaged and sitting on the coast.<eos> Which means we have the advantage.<eos> We'll be headed to New Orleans ourselves, and we're gonna get there ahead of your friends.<eos> We'll lie in wait for them there, and we will take them out.<eos> You should know, sir... I've given everything for my country... to serve a mission I didn't ask for.<eos> And I'd be sitting safely in a cabin in the woods in Virginia with my family right now if I hadn't stayed with this ship. Instead...<eos> I lost my wife... to the virus.<eos> Didn't even get a chance to hold her hand... Or say goodbye.<eos> My children did.
Oh! Look, I know technically I'm not supposed to help out, but rules are made to be broken.<eos> They were made to be followed.<eos> Nothing is made to be broken.<eos> Uh, piñatas.<eos> - Glow sticks.<eos> - Karate boards.<eos> Spaghetti when you have a small pot.<eos> Rules.<eos> Look, someone's messing with my life here. I thought you guys had my back.<eos> We do.
May I ask why didn't you deliver it in person like she asked?<eos> - Well, because she's fucking crazy.<eos> - Ah. She has been trying to shake down Vernon Littlefield. Now she's trying to shake down me.<eos> Trash like this is why I didn't want you here in the first place.<eos> - Joe mentioned that.<eos> - Joe is a fucking idiot.<eos> No, Joe's not a fucking idiot.<eos> Joe hired me to bring in big money players, protect the wealth, and capitalize on the success of men in a world that, with all due respect, Mr. Anderson, you don't know anything about with the exception of when you watch the Red Zone Channel<eos> Monetize my friendships is what Joe's been preaching to me from the moment I walked in the door, and I always thought that that came directly from you.<eos> Everything does except the bad shit.
You see, girls, the bad thing about being bullied is that every time it happens, it steals a little piece of who you are.<eos> And then, if it happens enough, little by little, you become just a little less of who you were meant to be.<eos> And that's not cool.<eos> And these two girls up here, without knowing it, I'm sure, stole a little piece of Max and Caroline.<eos> When they stole their little idea.<eos> And that's so not cool.<eos> Yeah, that's so not cool.<eos> Max, Caroline, we'll stop making the shirts.<eos> Ash, I never said that.<eos> Ah, no, Kemberly. I did.
That's... that's your name.<eos> It is now.<eos> Who's your friend?<eos> Hey, this is... between you and me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You think you can handle me all by yourself?<eos> You're kind of a... A wild girl?<eos> You really don't want to know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Here it comes.<eos> Don't let go!<eos> Monroe, the jar!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I have a pulse.<eos> Good.<eos> She's warm.<eos> What happened?<eos> Well, things got a little intense.<eos> Yeah, they did.
Look, Juliette, we're just trying to help you get back what you lost.<eos> Take it.<eos> Please. Well, all right.<eos> Let's just get this over with.<eos> Juliette, stop.<eos> Do I look like I need anybody's help?<eos> No, Juliette!<eos> It's all we've got!<eos> When are you all gonna learn that I like who I am?<eos> Well, we don't.
Oh.<eos> And you thought, what a good idea!<eos> He was my boss, so yeah.<eos> I couldn't find any.<eos> I texted Chili, told him, but he never texted me back.<eos> So you kept the money.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And kept my mouth shut. It wouldn't have looked too good after he died.<eos> Yeah, no, you're right.<eos> And it still doesn't.
Right there.<eos> Right there, aisle Three.<eos> Sweet musical Jesus, that's your friend?<eos> Oh, she's filthy, and fine.<eos> She's very attractive, I know.<eos> Hey, I try not to look at her like that.<eos> That must be difficult.<eos> It is.<eos> She haunts my dreams... just kidding.<eos> She does though.
- We're going to a rave?<eos> - Cameron and I are going.<eos> Well, I'm so coming with, unless it's a date.<eos> It's not.<eos> And you're not.<eos> It's official business.<eos> So what?<eos> It's a rave.<eos> The agency doesn't control the entire L.A. dance scene.<eos> Do they?
You can't just run off.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry.<eos> We had no idea.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, but I have all my stuff for school.<eos> I'm staying.<eos> No, you're not, Paige.<eos> Paige, come on.<eos> They're right.<eos> We thought they knew.<eos> They didn't.
Miss Hanson?<eos> I'm a friend of your husband.<eos> Clark knows you must be worried.<eos> Is he all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Nice and easy. Yeah?<eos> And just remember that the lens is right there, so...<eos> They won't think it's strange to see a woman carrying a purse onto the plant floor?<eos> I take it every time I leave the office.<eos> Every girl does.
The best, most dangerous officers the KGB has.<eos> Now they got to somebody inside, and it wasn't me.<eos> Work on that.<eos> Can't you go in there and say something?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> She did her job.<eos> This wasn't the arrangement.<eos> I'm dealing with this side of things now.<eos> Got a problem with that?<eos> I do.
I'm sorry, Clark.<eos> I, uh...<eos> Martha, where are you going?<eos> To my parents'.<eos> I need a break.<eos> We need a break. - Martha--<eos> - No, um...<eos> I can't take it.<eos> Everyone at work knows that I'm lying.<eos> - No, no, they don't.
You have a hunch?<eos> I've no idea.<eos> I'll cut to the chase.<eos> I saw you swipe your loyalty card when you had customers who didn't have one, so you collected points on their purchases.<eos> It's impossible, I don't have my card on me.<eos> It's not impossible. With my own eyes, I saw you.<eos> Thierry saw you on the video. So we have proof.<eos> You know how this works.<eos> You know the word for what you did.<eos> Don't you?
I'll manage.<eos> He Wasn't bad, you know?<eos> He has studied in the US and settled dovvn over there.<eos> He's ideal husband material.<eos> What do you think about him?<eos> Siddharth?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Supriya...<eos> - Siddhadh you have to trust me.<eos> Honestly? Right now I don't!
- I need to say something.<eos> - You can't say anything.<eos> - I'm getting pummeled out there.<eos> - She's right, Cy. It can't look like I'm behind the curve.<eos> Anything you say right now will end up vilifying law enforcement.<eos> I was on duty.<eos> I, uh, heard over the radio that a kid had just shoplifted a cellphone from a store on Ambrose Street I'm driving on.<eos> About 10 seconds later, I see him walking.<eos> How do you know it's the same kid?<eos> I don't, of course, not at first.
- Dieter.<eos> - Black body builder?<eos> - Gay flight attendant.<eos> What was the problem?<eos> Door was jammed.<eos> You were up there a long time.<eos> He's got boyfriend trouble, and he wanted to talk about it.<eos> What kind of trouble?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> I really do.
I am not the one with the problem!<eos> Draw your feelings, don't shout them.<eos> I'm not shouting.<eos> (loudly): This is shouting!<eos> What the hell?<eos> ! I-I think you got a flat.<eos> Great.<eos> Way to go!<eos> Please tell me you have a spare.<eos> Course I do.
Jessica.<eos> Do you need something?<eos> I came by earlier, and you weren't in.<eos> I had a meeting, and I really didn't think you wanted to be looped in on my schedule.<eos> I don't, and I'm not checking up on you.<eos> I just didn't know if you were coming in.<eos> You mean you weren't sure if I was ever coming in again.<eos> You wouldn't be the first person to leave a job for personal reasons.<eos> It sounds to me like you have an agenda.<eos> - I don't.
Yeah, it was.<eos> No, I was gonna say because of Harvey.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Harvey never wanted to take this case, so he put a clock on it to get me to drop it.<eos> That's why we're where we are right now. Listen to me;<eos> Harvey is out there right now busting his ass to fix everything.<eos> No, Donna. He doesn't give a shit about this case, and he never did.<eos> Then why did he send me here to tell you to do everything you can to stick it to Evan Smith?<eos> She didn't take the deal, did she?<eos> No, she didn't.
She's an honest-to-God princess.<eos> Ah, really?<eos> Hey, tell me something.<eos> I heard that Queen Elizabeth in person is actually not that funny.<eos> I am from Africa.<eos> Wow, Africa.<eos> I had a good friend who really wanted to go there.<eos> So, uh, you speak English there?<eos> I speak five languages.<eos> (sputters) Nobody does.
Fighting since you woke up? Hold on.<eos> Last time I was here, you were still trying to figure out your feelings.<eos> How long since...? Christmas.<eos> And you've already moved in together?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I mean, we spend pretty much every night together, and, obviously, every day together.<eos> Are you crazy? Maybe.<eos> Who moves that fast?<eos> Last time I was here, I advised you, be patient. You think we're moving too fast?<eos> Most new couples do.
- Yeah, i know.<eos> Is it exciting enough for you?<eos> Asks the girl who got shot in the face.<eos> I don't know. God, you're a barrel of laughs today, burgess.<eos> I want something different for my life, And i do nothing to change the outcome, And i was given the chance to go wherever i wanted,<eos> And i did absolutely nothing, and what does it say about me?<eos> Squad, hold us down on a personal at 4215 roosevelt.<eos> (dispatcher) copy that.<eos> 4215 roosevelt. You really want my honest answer?<eos> Yeah, i do.

- Hurry up.<eos> Do something.<eos> - I'm coming, okay?<eos> Just let the fool die.<eos> Aubrey...<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Oh, man, it's nasty.<eos> Okay, i don't know what else to do.<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> I do.
So, that's a problem. [growls]<eos> Nope, that is your problem.<eos> Then may I have the gun, please?<eos> [growling continues] no.<eos> Oh, my god, you are so immature.<eos> And you are so Big.<eos> [light chuckle] this is going to be all, dan'l boone.<eos> Alrighty, I think that's got it.<eos> Nurse, would you close for me?<eos> You already did that, doctor.
So why isn't there any sign of benzodiazepine in her tissue?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Science is not my thing.<eos> Yeah, making up a story isn't your thing either.<eos> Benzodiazepine is not an upper like Ritalin, Tyler, it's a sedative.<eos> Well, then she needed to relax, I guess.<eos> I don't know, she was high-strung.<eos> Why did you post her photo?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
In the meantime, sir,<eos> I'd like to take another run at him.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> I'm not talking.<eos> Well, that's okay.<eos> You don't have to talk.<eos> You can just listen.<eos> Yeah, we know that...<eos> you're not the shooter.<eos> Of course you do.
I'm here about Castiel.<eos> Was there any of his Grace left?<eos> Question is, are you willing to pay for it?<eos> He must be returned intact.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Told you last time I saw you I'd get out of the slammer.<eos> We need to know how to remove the Mark of Cain from Dean's arm.<eos> He's gone nuclear!<eos> Who knew the Mark was so toxic?<eos> Actually, I did.
I don't do the psychic stuff no more.<eos> Being around people, it's kind of hell.<eos> All those brains yapping all the time drives a guy bananas.<eos> Because you can hear everyone's thoughts.<eos> Well, not yours.<eos> All I'm getting from you is colors.<eos> But the hippie over here? I'm seeing some creep-ass hobbit-lookin' fella, a prison cell?<eos> That's heaven's jail.<eos> Heaven's got a freakin' jail?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Jenkins and I gotta open the door and, let in the sunbeam, so... it's gonna get a little hot.<eos> Hey, we were all right.<eos> We were fine through the three months we were on our own?<eos> I mean, this...<eos> This is not gonna kill me.<eos> No, but we weren't fine.<eos> We weren't okay.<eos> I... I don't even know why we went our separate ways.<eos> It just happens to people.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Now nothing.<eos> Mr. Stone.<eos> That's it.<eos> It's done.<eos> At the rate they're going, we only have a few minutes left.<eos> And then what, huh?<eos> Jenkins?<eos> Tell me you got a plan "B."<eos> Yes, uh, Mr. Stone.<eos> I do.
No, in football.<eos> Duh! And we're gonna crush 'em!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Jenkins was right...<eos> Wexler equals weird.<eos> I wonder if thinking your small liberal arts school can beat Michigan is magical delusion or just regular delusion.<eos> Appareat! Diabolus! Ignis!<eos> Do I even want to know what they're cheering?<eos> No.<eos> You do not.
Intersecting circles of magic and summoning.<eos> That's 18th century occult spiritualism.<eos> That's definitely magicy.<eos> We got to find the origin of this house.<eos> All right, I bet you anything Professor Bancroft would have something to say about these symbols.<eos> Okay, so, divide and conquer?<eos> Ezekiel, Cassandra, check out the house.<eos> Stone and I will go talk to the professor. Admit it...<eos> You just don't want to go to a frat party.<eos> I really don't.
Easy, almost.<eos> Ah! Stupid bloody brick.<eos> Lightning must've fried all the codes.<eos> No, that's not a code problem.<eos> That's magic.<eos> Some sort of blocking spell.<eos> It's not Hittite.<eos> It's not Ashanti twi.<eos> Oh, it's Druid. We got this.<eos> We do?
If we give ourselves away to the executor, he'll certainly come after the others.<eos> Whatever you say, big daddy.<eos> - Is that too much?<eos> - Fabulous.<eos> Magic is real. Yeah.<eos> Spells, witches, ghosts.<eos> I fought a tentacle monster.<eos> It's a weird gig.<eos> How do you use it? This magic?<eos> We don't.
Let's just get it and go.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Gentlemen?<eos> - Got it!<eos> I need you to...<eos> - Plan "B"!<eos> Plan "B"!<eos> I thought they were only supposed to do that - if it all goes pear-shaped.<eos> - Apparently, it did.
We've been through this loop a couple times now, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> And you're the only one who ever remembers any of this?<eos> Yes.<eos> What? What is that?<eos> Nothing. Nothing.<eos> It's just, a temporal loop implies a complicated interplay of cause and effect, and you're more of a... wing-it kinda guy.<eos> I'm just touched by your trust, really.<eos> Now, Cassandra said if we shut the quantum computer down, this all ends.<eos> I did?
- Okay, I'm gonna get it. - I'm not mad at you.<eos> - I'm gonna get it.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry. There's a university on the island of Cicely, a town with 2,000 people?<eos> Yeah, University of Cicely.<eos> The University of Cicely. Very prestigious.<eos> - Wow. And you teach there?<eos> - I do. - In 11 departments at once.<eos> - Yeah. I don't... well, when I'm not saving the World Heritage Sites from tomb raiders, but, you know... shall we?<eos> - Oh, Egyptology!<eos> - I didn't...
Time-delay metallurgic cryptography.<eos> Yeah, but that's a lot of time.<eos> Statue of Liberty took two decades to turn green. - This must've taken...<eos> - Centuries?<eos> Message from the past, hidden.<eos> Not visible until this very moment.<eos> Sound familiar?<eos> "Jenkins, the key is in your Guardian's name."<eos> You don't have a Guardian.<eos> Of course I do.

You know my dog's name too?<eos> And our music program has especially taken off.<eos> Twilight?<eos> This is getting ridiculous.<eos> I must apologize for the curiosity of my prize student.<eos> Your student?<eos> The smart ones are always curious.<eos> I'll return her to check in with the rest of her classmates.<eos> I didn't know Twilight had a twin sister!<eos> She doesn't!
I'm not sure.<eos> Perhaps you should get to know them after all.<eos> But I thought you didn't want me to?<eos> Let's just say I'm covering my bases.<eos> Who knows, perhaps they will reveal to you the secret to Canterlot High's new found success.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Spying feels kind of wrong.<eos> Well, it's your decision, Twilight.<eos> It's not as if your application hangs in the balance.<eos> On second thought, yes it does.
Better than alright!<eos> We won!<eos> Yeah, we won, but somebody could've been seriously hurt!<eos> The magic is going haywire and I have no idea how to fix it!<eos> Um, excuse me.<eos> I didn't mean for any of this to happen.<eos> I just wanted to learn about the strange energy coming from your school.<eos> I didn't know that it was magic or how it works!<eos> That's okay.<eos> Neither do we.
But I'm not sure how!<eos> What do you mean you don't know how?<eos> It also causes these corresponding rips to appear.<eos> I don't know how that works either!<eos> Is there anything you do know?<eos> Like how to get our magic hack, or how to fix the portal to Equestria?<eos> Equestria?<eos> You're supposed to be so smart, but did you ever think that you shouldn't be messing around with things you don't understand?<eos> But I want to understand!<eos> But you don't!
The games will continue, and Crystal Prep will prevail despite your antics and whatever performance enhancing regimen your students are on!<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't stop all this from happening.<eos> It's not your fault, Sunset.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> I should know how to control the magic I brought here.<eos> But I don't.<eos> I let everyone down.<eos> And now Principal Cinch thinks we're cheating!<eos> It doesn't matter what Principal Cinch thinks.<eos> But it does.
CSU found cigarette butts that match the pack in his pocket.<eos> And if he was up to no good, it wouldn't be his first time.<eos> He did a nickel at elmira for aggravated assault... got out a few years ago.<eos> He's still got his work uniform on, so let's see if anyone at go quick towing - knows how he wound up here.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> He wasn't on the job, I can tell you that.<eos> We didn't have any pickups out that way, so I don't know what he was doing there.<eos> Well, who would?<eos> Did he have any family?<eos> He doesn't.
When Henry didn't return my calls, I had a colleague in San Francisco ping his cell.<eos> So you found him in the park?<eos> When I got there, he was already dead.<eos> So I took his phone and his keys, and I began to investigate.<eos> And why didn't you call us from the crime scene?<eos> 'Cause I didn't want to waste my time having this conversation.<eos> My friend has been murdered.<eos> I have to find out who did it.<eos> No.<eos> I do.
- Thank you, Officer.<eos> - You're welcome, ma'am.<eos> You missed a spot.<eos> NYPD, let's go.<eos> Makes sense why you were trying to keep a low profile at the hotel.<eos> You're famous.<eos> Rosie Webb, out of Vedra Beach, Florida star witness in the ongoing Barry Madden trial.<eos> Says here you helped him bilk billions from innocent investors.<eos> Just 'cause I work with the guy, doesn't mean I helped him steal.<eos> So you didn't?
Is this guy an animal or what?<eos> Actually, I've kind of noticed you checking her out in the rearview.<eos> You're so pretty, Carrie.<eos> I mean, I'd kill for pores like that.<eos> Can I get my video game back again?<eos> If you promise to stop talking, okay?<eos> Come on, get up there!<eos> No! You guys, are we gonna pull over soon?<eos> 'Cause Doc says I got to move every couple hours, or the fluid builds up, and that's when the gastro esophageal reflex kicks in, and you do not want to smell it.<eos> No, we do not.
- This is the short version?<eos> Like I always did, and I found out this company was a front for the Careyes cartel.<eos> So when I told Barry this, he saw it as an opportunity to skim from them since he knew they couldn't go to the feds.<eos> And now they're after you because you're Barry's right hand.<eos> Yeah, what a relief.<eos> Relief?<eos> Well, that means Barry's not after me.<eos> See, I knew he wouldn't betray me.<eos> Oh, you and Madden had a thing.<eos> Yes, you did.
WoodbineJenkins73.<eos> What if she asked the other player to come get her?<eos> Woodbine, it's a town about 15 miles from here.<eos> I'll get Jay to track him down.<eos> Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Got it.<eos> Guy Rosie's been chatting with is Mike Van Loon out of Woodbine.<eos> Got an address too.<eos> This guy owns a brown pickup?<eos> Uh, sure does.
Davis Bennett isn't playing tonight.<eos> Really?<eos> You can take her back to the bar.<eos> Whatever happened to our private drink?<eos> Oh, Kenny will set you up.<eos> Don't turn around, we're being watched.<eos> I have a clue.<eos> Wanna dance?<eos> You don't dance.<eos> - I do now.
February 9, 2001, full moon.<eos> I remember you ditched me to play blackjack all night.<eos> Yeah, and I came back to the hotel room $8,000 up.<eos> Yes, I remember.<eos> All that cash.<eos> All that cash?<eos> That's what you remember?<eos> So about that thing.<eos> I went to see a guy, um, who I thought might know something about Warner's murder.<eos> - And did he?
Harold, stop this now.<eos> If I'm dead, you won't kill her.<eos> There won't be a need.<eos> Do you really care that much about this woman?<eos> If she dies, it's my fault.<eos> And I will not be responsible for one more friend's death.<eos> Shaw's not your fault.<eos> Even if she does turn up dead, it's not your fault.<eos> I asked her to help us that day.<eos> I did, Harold.
Ready? Yeah.<eos> Oh, crazy flight.<eos> Oh, those hydraulics were loud.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ah, bonjour, bonjour.<eos> Two whiskeys, please, Chantelle.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Say, I'm looking for an old sky pal of mine.<eos> Do you know Roger Peralta?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
Isn't it obvious?<eos> I'm being arrested.<eos> Sherlock Holmes, you're under arrest for the murder of Maria Gutierrez.<eos> You have the right to remain silent and refuse to answer questions.<eos> Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law.<eos> All I could get out of my buddy at the 3-5 was that some new witness came forward.<eos> Someone who said they saw Sherlock kill Maria?<eos> No, someone who says they heard him threaten her life a few days before she disappeared.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> The guys at the 3-5 do.
Okay, lily, ballet at 11:00, Then a playdate, then karate class at 3:00, So why don't you go get your uniform?<eos> Chop chop!<eos> Cam.<eos> What? She's in karate. It's not offensive.<eos> Debatable, but why would you schedule all this extra stuff<eos> On the same day as her talent show?<eos> Okay, are you accusing me of overscheduling Our tone-deaf daughter so she's so tired She misses the talent show and doesn't humiliate herself?<eos> Lily has no talent.<eos> Because she's 7. No one has talent at 7.<eos> I did.
I sure do.<eos> And I think I might be ready to give it to you.<eos> Then never mind.<eos> Wow, you're gonna be that honest about it.<eos> Saves time.<eos> Well, in that case, I want to move to your desk.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because it's no secret that in a few years, you're going back to Gordon, Schmidt, and Van Dyke.<eos> And let me guess, you want to come with me when I do.<eos> No, I don't.
I'm aware of that.<eos> Then you should also be aware that if Woodall keeps his job, he's likely to go after Louis.<eos> I could've done that math, and so could you, so...<eos> I might be able to help them get Forstman... on something else.<eos> Does this have something to do with when he offered you that job 12 years ago?<eos> Yes.<eos> I told you that man was trouble.<eos> And I told you I wouldn't abandon Marcus and you were wrong about him.<eos> So this has something to do with Marcus.<eos> Yes, it does.
Nothing.<eos> Like I said, I just haven't talked to you in a while, and I miss you.<eos> I miss you too, Harvey, but unless you got something else,<eos> I've got to go. The kids are in the bath.<eos> Nothing else.<eos> Love you, Harvey.<eos> I love you too.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey. Listen, I was thinking about what you said, about me pitying you.<eos> And I don't.
I'm just surprised.<eos> Why?<eos> I didn't know you played the market.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Which is fine, you know.<eos> It's good that we don't share everything in common.<eos> Seriously?<eos> What?<eos> G, I love you like a brother, but we basically have nothing in common.<eos> Of course we do.
It's a hard-enough job as it is, but with no one to go home to...<eos> Never met the right guy.<eos> I realize it may be uncomfortable for you to talk about your personal life, but I just want to give you an opportunity to tell me anything I might need to know.<eos> Any romantic relationship that could have possibly compromised you in any way?<eos> I don't date much.<eos> I was involved with an agent in the office a couple of years ago-- Chris Amador.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think I was more involved with him than he was with me.<eos> But I'm sure you know what happened with Agent Amador.<eos> I do.
Israelis.<eos> People who I thought were my friends, but they traded me like a slave to these... thugs...<eos> These monsters who never let me speak to anyone or even send a message home.<eos> All my son knows is that one day, I didn't come home.<eos> Maybe I died.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> Or maybe I... abandoned him.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> I lived most of my life here, Nina, but I never knew anyone who would do something like this.<eos> I did.
There's no motive to kill him.<eos> Whereas with me...<eos> Does anyone outside of the program know the nature of your work here?<eos> Not that I'm aware of.<eos> But what about inside the program?<eos> Tim from engineering never liked me.<eos> The more probable scenario is Mr. Peterson was involved with some bad people.<eos> It seems like he hardly left his apartment.<eos> You never know what goes on behind closed doors.<eos> I do.
He thinks the moon is a hologram being projected by the FBI to hypnotize Americans into submission.<eos> Told you, certifiable.<eos> I am killing it today.<eos> This is my least favorite hour of the month.<eos> You say that every month.<eos> Then why do I keep doing it?<eos> Opening the floodgates, giving voice... nay, valuable office hours... to the crackpots and the crazies?<eos> You're the dutiful servant of the American people, and the American people need their pulse taken.<eos> The American people believe the air force is chemically neutering us when it snows, Holly.<eos> - This next lady doesn't.
How do we begin?<eos> With more laughing.<eos> Are you aware that your laugh is now the number-one selling ringtone on iTunes?<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> No.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> That's crazy!<eos> - You didn't know this?<eos> - I didn't.
You have one job... one job... to fake your way through this fake engagement!<eos> - Cyrus. - What is Satan's problem this time?<eos> What, does he want to watch?<eos> 'Cause that costs extra!<eos> No. You have a heart condition.<eos> Sit.<eos> He is in breach of contract.<eos> I want that whore out of my house.<eos> The contract says I can have a life as long as I'm discreet.<eos> Yes, it does.
Remind yourself of that.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I wasn't implying...<eos> I have a position. You have a job.<eos> You fix.<eos> That's your job.<eos> You fix or you leave.<eos> Do you have a problem with that? - No, I...<eos> - Because if you do...<eos> I do not.
A gold heart!<eos> Really?<eos> I just - - I guess I'm just more into the chase right now.<eos> You know, like, the fun.<eos> I'm just not looking for anything serious.<eos> Well, it's good you know what you want -- before anyone got hurt.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Of course I have the receipt. Ow!<eos> ... Kay, what if I didn't?
Okay, dad, look. If it'll help, I'll call the hotel people and I'll straighten all this out.<eos> I don't think more calls from you is the answer, and by the way,<eos> I don't think you're gonna get that job anymore. Fine!<eos> I don't care!<eos> I don't care! I never wanted that job in the first place!<eos> Well, then why did you tell me about it in the first place?<eos> Because I wanted you to tell me not to take the job because I'm your daughter!<eos> You know, the thing behind the mirror that you... trim your nose hairs with?<eos> Don't you even care if I stay or go?<eos> Of course I do.
Last one he brought back, some girl with a skanky wrist tattoo.<eos> I heard 'em chant some weird voodoo stuff from inside that crappy trailer.<eos> Wait.<eos> You said, wrist tattoo?<eos> I'm pretty sure that's not the only place she had one.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> Well, it's cozy.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Something seems very wrong here.<eos> It always does.
Anyway, thanks, Pablo.<eos> Kelly, if you really hate what did this, you should come with us.<eos> Let's bring the fight to it.<eos> I mean, I guess I don't know what else I would do.<eos> Well, she shouldn't be alone right now.<eos> Plus, you're kinda like a young me.<eos> Deadites ruined your life and you're hot as hell.<eos> Okay, let's get to the book store and hit the undo button on this BS once and for all.<eos> You know they were Jewish, right?<eos> I - I did not.
Anyway, I don't have a choice!<eos> I have to trust you, is that it?<eos> Well, one day you'll hear shrieks and...<eos> I'll blame Artus or the TV.<eos> It's too easy!<eos> Too easy?<eos> You listen to me.<eos> A jealous man destroyed me. I'm done with that!<eos> You don't order me about.<eos> No one does!
"Yes, I your hero."<eos> "Yes, I your hero."<eos> "Yes, I your hero."<eos> I want my honor back.<eos> "Yes, I your hero."<eos> I, Srikant Mathur.<eos> Disgraced Officer.<eos> - Who gives a damn about it, dad.<eos> - I care a damn!<eos> I do.
Thank you.<eos> Uh, black please, no sugar.<eos> Yes, uh, two coffees, black please.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Elleanor Delfont-Bogard.<eos> But people usually just call me Ellie.<eos> And you are?<eos> I just graduated from the Met Police Service with a degree in forensics psychology.<eos> I... hope you don't mind if I observe.<eos> And if I do?
They did.<eos> Then I need to remind you that my connection to this cannot be made public.<eos> You find that leak... and you plug it up.<eos> We've gone through the computer files and phone records of 3000 Argento employees.<eos> Already narrowed the field down to 12 suspects.<eos> Call me back when you've narrowed it down to one.<eos> Well, we know that whoever abducted Sophie, did it to get to her source, to silence him.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You said when you got here that you didn't think it was Wombosi.<eos> - And I still don't.
- Thank you so much, sir.<eos> This must be the oldest computer left in existence.<eos> That's an old Packard Bell.<eos> My first computer.<eos> Gotta love Window 98.<eos> There's nothing for me to work with here.<eos> We better head back.<eos> There's one more thing we could try.<eos> Sir, do you still have the ID card for WN453?<eos> Er, yes I do.
Thanks, Joe, but I'm not really in the mood for company.<eos> Can I ask you a question, Doc?<eos> If I say no, will it stop you?<eos> When you went to see Kate just before she took off, did you talk to her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So? Did it seem to you like she was having second thoughts?<eos> Not that I was aware of.<eos> Then don't you think --<eos> That it's none of our business?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Go back.<eos> There.<eos> Spears had tattoo magazines all over the place.<eos> He had dozens of books marked on the subject, yet he didn't have a tattoo himself.<eos> That's weird.<eos> Bishop, go get your BLUESTAR kit.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> McGee, find out everything you can on a Miranda Flemming.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Just do it, huh?
But when we sat down, he spoke as if he knew me.<eos> Agent Keen, what a pleasure.<eos> But you didn't know him, you'd never met.<eos> Did he, what, just expect you to believe him?<eos> - Ha-ha-ha. No, of course not.<eos> - I had no idea what he expected.<eos> I'm a criminal. Criminals are notorious liars.<eos> Everything about me is a lie.<eos> You must've known how strange all of this was.<eos> - Of course I did.
I like Mary.<eos> No, I appreciate that, but you don't know her like I do.<eos> I mean, she's not gonna just, you know...<eos> Mary!<eos> Act naturally.<eos> We're taking her to see an acquaintance at St. Bede's.<eos> What acquaintance?<eos> Neurologist.<eos> Okay, does she know that?<eos> Of course she does.
My dad built Arsenal as my birthday present, and I just modified him to save the world.<eos> You might've seen it coming if you weren't so busy building statues of yourself.<eos> No mere robot can withstand my power.<eos> Arsenal's no mere robot.<eos> He's my father's greatest invention.<eos> Should I obtain the Gauntlet, Tony?<eos> I'm thinking that's a good idea.<eos> Well, that certainly brought you down to Earth, Thanos.<eos> No one challenges...<eos> We do.
(Sophie) No.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> (Sophie) It's not me, but I'm okay.<eos> Sophie, why are you crying?<eos> When I heard what you said about the dresses...<eos> It's just--<eos> It's almost, kind of like, you think I have bad taste or something.<eos> No.<eos> Caroline thinks you have great taste.<eos> She does?
I don't understand.<eos> How do you want to spread the vaccine?<eos> Well, if you think about it, you were able to kill 5 billion people<eos> - simply by breathing. - I...<eos> So the key to transmission lies within you.<eos> If I could teach healthy lungs to hold and reproduce the cure the same way yours do with the virus, well, then I could...<eos> You could make the cure contagious.<eos> Of course, the trick would be understanding just how your body does it, to be able to compare the D.N.A. sequence change between yours and the primordial.<eos> You have my blood samples.<eos> I do. ‭
Hell's wrong with her?<eos> She's kind of a drunk.<eos> She'll sober up.<eos> Drunk, huh?<eos> You want to take down The Countess?<eos> So do I.<eos> And Iris here is the key.<eos> Nobody gets closer to The Countess than she does.<eos> You did.<eos> We both did.
I don't know, you call it what you want to.<eos> It was people who are recreating or are continuing the crimes committed by notorious killers from the past.<eos> March-- there was a guy.<eos> One guy called himself March, James Patrick March.<eos> You just check out the history of the hotel.<eos> That's the name of the guy who built it.<eos> And you had dinner with him.<eos> I was in a room with a guy who claimed to be him, a guy who I think is responsible for the five dead bodies on the wall in my office!<eos> You think he's The Ten Commandment Killer?<eos> I do.

- No.<eos> His name is Tristan.<eos> He's young. He's beautiful.<eos> He's... exquisitely damaged.<eos> He's mine.<eos> Mostly.<eos> Tristan?<eos> Isn't that the name of the Countess' new squeeze?<eos> She doesn't love him.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
You're a sight for sore eyes.<eos> Why the glum face?<eos> A splash of brown plaid will set you right.<eos> He would have been ten today.<eos> My boy.<eos> So much potential on the day of birth.<eos> Should be a cause to celebrate.<eos> Not a day to mourn.<eos> Didn't work out that way.<eos> Maybe it did.
Let us out!<eos> Open up!<eos> Max!<eos> I told you, we should have never trusted that bitch!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Mama... smells appetizers.<eos> Why do I feel like a teenager that's about to get caught?<eos> We're not supposed to be sleeping together.<eos> Who says we have to go through with it?<eos> I do.
But what we have is an addict's high.<eos> In the moment, it seems like it's never ending.<eos> But it always ends.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> There will never be anyone like me.<eos> John... you can't tell me that this isn't what you want.<eos> - Come on. - No.<eos> Alex is not the answer.<eos> She doesn't know about you.<eos> Not the way I do.
Like he's an imposter?<eos> Who do you think I am?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> Want me to give you a DNA sample or something?<eos> No. I don't have anything from the fourth grade to match it to.<eos> You know, Stiles, I came back here for Scott but I also came back for you.<eos> Someone like you.<eos> Someone who's willing to walk into the woods in the middle of the night to protect his friends.<eos> I don't have anyone like that, but Scott does.<eos> You all do.
Like he was paralyzed.<eos> I think I know what she is.<eos> Do you care to enlighten the rest of us?<eos> Because this doesn't look too good.<eos> It wasn't a werewolf.<eos> Kanima.<eos> Hey, Deaton, how the hell did she get through the Mountain Ash?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's a barrier no supernatural creature should be able to cross.<eos> Scott did it.
Are you listening to my breakup mix?<eos> Since you're my best man, I wanted you to be the first to know...<eos> She left me, Junior.<eos> The wedding's been called off.<eos> Linda left me.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Zoe, we're gonna have to reschedule the bread.<eos> Yeah, Senior was so broken up over Linda, he forgot his cell phone at home.<eos> So he didn't tell Tony he was coming?<eos> No, he did not.
You're done with him.<eos> The hell was that?<eos> That was the FBI alibiing our best suspect.<eos> The FBI agent, Branch-- you think she lied to you?<eos> In order to alibi Brady Dietz.<eos> Most likely 'cause she doesn't want to give up a key asset in her investigation into Everyone.<eos> We were hoping you could call someone at the Bureau, put pressure on Branch.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> You're asking me to accuse a federal agent of covering up a murder.<eos> 'Cause she did.
Yeah, not exactly like...<eos> But, yeah, once or twice.<eos> So you've had to deal with people who are scared.<eos> What do you say to them?<eos> I'm asking what I should say to you.<eos> That it will be all right.<eos> That the Doctor will save us.<eos> And when you say it, do you believe it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Though you might find you've lost a couple of other memories too.<eos> People you went to school with, previous addresses or how to drink liquids.<eos> That's you two done.<eos> Where's Bennett?<eos> What will happen to them?<eos> UNIT will cut out the Faraday Cage with them inside and take it away.<eos> Then the space-hearse will be destroyed, so the writing doesn't infect anyone else.<eos> What do I do now?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I do.
Amen.<eos> I thought I hit bottom when I got sent to prison, but turns out, I wasn't even close.<eos> After those cold steel gates slammed shut behind me, I was so lonely and hopeless, I decided I might as well start drinking again.<eos> I felt like that at rehab when they took away my iPad.<eos> Now... for those of you who haven't been to prison, you pretty much have two choices when it comes to getting loaded:<eos> Toilet wine-- a lovely mixture of moldy bread, rotted fruit, and ketchup.<eos> Ketchup makes it a rosé.<eos> And, of course, heroin, smuggled via somebody's boyfriend's poop chute.<eos> In either case, you really gotta want it.<eos> And I did.
United Westside African Methodist Episcopal<eos> Holy Tabernacle Church of God.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I think a couple of them merged.<eos> I can't believe you're buying into this.<eos> What is your problem with God?<eos> I don't have a problem with God.<eos> I happen to be a very spiritual person.<eos> My problem is with an ex-con looking me in the eye and telling me I lost Alvin because God has some freakin' plan.<eos> Well... maybe he does.
I'll get back to you.<eos> Naveed, your nephew?<eos> You gave him this watch.<eos> What-what was the reason again?<eos> You wanted to teach him about, uh, being on time?<eos> To teach him about responsibility?<eos> But here you are, shrugging off your own.<eos> By blaming the FBI, the-the U.S. government.<eos> The thing is... we didn't turn your nephew into a terrorist.<eos> You did.
Good.<eos> 'Cause neither do I.<eos> All right... bus is ready, but HRT and SWAT both said they haven't detected any movement or sound inside the building for the last 60 minutes.<eos> Try 'em again.<eos> Still not answering.<eos> We haven't heard from them in almost two hours.<eos> Do you think that Callen would try to take them?<eos> Did you hear gunshots?<eos> No.<eos> Then he didn't.
So, now... She'll never see me coming.<eos> Ah, morning', Sunshine.<eos> Monroe Styne.<eos> Pleasure.<eos> Ditto.<eos> I'd shake your hand, but, uh...<eos> Well, I have to say I am impressed the way you charged in here all guns blazin'.<eos> I'd buy tickets to that show.<eos> You didn't think that was really gonna work, did you?<eos> Usually does.
Poor Dean.<eos> Let's just have a nice wee cup of tea... and negotiate.<eos> -What do you want?<eos> -Oh, well... We know what I wanted.<eos> Soiled the sheets on that one, didn't we?<eos> Let's talk about what I'll take.<eos> My freedom, guaranteed... and the Codex.<eos> -Sam, you can't be--<eos> -Do you know which spell?<eos> I do.
We're in an animal clinic and I need equipment designed for humans.<eos> I said that we're going to take her to the hospital.<eos> I didn't say we're going through the front door.<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> Somebody hit the fire alarm?<eos> Do you want to learn?<eos> I can show you.<eos> You're showing me plenty right now.<eos> I've got nothing to hide.<eos> And I do?
- That's the only truth you need to know.<eos> - A jury may feel differently.<eos> And something tells me we're about to find out.<eos> We're done.<eos> I'll issue my ruling in the morning.<eos> Die Entrechteten.<eos> Really, Aram.<eos> These misanthropes have been on my radar for years.<eos> - The FBI must have some kind of file. - No.<eos> We do.
"Germany for Germans." On the surface, they're all about anti-immigration preservation of the Aryan race, but look a little deeper and you'll find they care far less about white power than they do about white powder.<eos> - They're drug dealers?<eos> - Among the most ruthless in Europe.<eos> Somewhere along the line, they realized that keeping German neighborhoods white is more than politics. It's economics.<eos> They're fighting a street war.<eos> Interpol estimates a dozen drug-related homicides in the last year alone.<eos> Tom Keen, the four-eyes who taught third grade is walking into that?<eos> - How do we find him?<eos> I can check, but I don't think we have any friends on the inside.<eos> I do.
This case is so far over your head, it would make your nose bleed.<eos> You intentionally accessed classified intelligence without authority.<eos> I should have you arrested right here and now.<eos> Smiling Tommy Connolly.<eos> You always were a smug bastard.<eos> And you were always a paranoid, self-righteous prick.<eos> Your Honor.<eos> Here's what we do.<eos> You're gonna quash this subpoena.<eos> - And if I don't?
Well, it sounds like it was a good run.<eos> I'm sorry it ended.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Any word on the kid?<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> Still in the OR. - Okay.<eos> I just need something good to come out of this day.<eos> Abdominal injuries are under control.<eos> I'm ready to close.<eos> You about done, Kepner? Almost.
Okay, take away the story. Right?<eos> Take away the good guys and the bad guys.<eos> It's a child who needs an organ and a patient with one to give.<eos> Bailey, that woman lost everything today. I know!<eos> Okay, you don't think I know that?<eos> But ethically, you have to.<eos> Ethically, I'm looking out for the best interest of my patient and his family.<eos> Hey, thanks for walking us out.<eos> You know, you didn't have to do that.<eos> With your sense of direction, I kind of did.
And Brett would have been here to help.<eos> So, Derek's back.<eos> - Is that a question?<eos> - No, it's just...<eos> And I'm glad, I am, for you and the kids, and I don't want to make this all about me.<eos> It's just he says he wants to come back and just work. For me.<eos> Still not sure what you're asking.<eos> Well, I'm asking should I believe that?<eos> Can I believe that?<eos> - I do.
And if it was a spy for France?<eos> If proof of your plan gets back to Francis, we might both lose our heads, whether Francis wants it or not.<eos> Surprise.<eos> Oh. It's you.<eos> You were expecting someone else?<eos> If your mother knew you were in my bed, she would not be happy.<eos> A fact of which you, Claude... are well aware.<eos> Does this technique typically work for you?<eos> Pursuing a man who has already politely declined?<eos> Of course it does.
You can't.<eos> I've already had consumption.<eos> - How did you survive?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> What are you, an angel?<eos> Ha ha ha! We listened to you sing, we clapped our hands.<eos> Can we go now?<eos> Let's play Caroline trivia.<eos> I don't even know what that is.<eos> Oh, sure you do!
Here we go.<eos> That was taken about six months before he died.<eos> 17 years old in that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I wish I could help you.<eos> OK, er... no problem.<eos> Er, could I just ask, then, if you recognise this phone number, Sir Phillip?<eos> 01 946 09 27.<eos> Well, 01 is obviously an old London number.<eos> Aside from that, no, I don't.
Anyway, I've transferred the right amount into the diocesan account so... well, it's all sorted.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, OK, well, that sounds simple enough.<eos> 'And er... I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention this to Grace.'<eos> She's at a bit of a low ebb at the moment, so...<eos> - 'Oh, sorry to hear that, Rob.'<eos> - No, no, it's all right.<eos> Just er...<eos> She just probably needs a good holiday, really.<eos> (CHUCKLES) We both do.
- Yeah.<eos> - Stronger? - Mm.<eos> I need to get some sleep.<eos> I know that it's very early.<eos> - Lillian?<eos> He knew that Dover would get out.<eos> Why wasn't anything done?<eos> He didn't say anything.<eos> It's up to the individual to ask for protection.<eos> - And he didn't do that.
Well, I knew the newspaper biz was in the weeds, but getting a corporate card knocked back...<eos> Actually, now it's saying to cut up the card.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> That-that won't be necessary. Um...<eos> Okay.<eos> Suppose we can use one of mine.<eos> I'm sure The Telegraph will reimburse me.<eos> Right?<eos> This trip has nothing to do with The Telegraph, does it?<eos> It did.
- There will be time to answer your questions, but first we must get you out of here.<eos> Quickly, s'il vous plaît.<eos> You do realize we just traveled halfway around the world because some random French guy asked us to, right?<eos> Anything's better than that Christmas bar.<eos> Jackson Oz,<eos> Abraham Kenyatta,<eos> Dr. Mitch Morgan and Jamie Campbell.<eos> I know you all have many questions, but if you'll please take a seat.<eos> I know this was difficult, but I'd like to think at least it brought you some small measure of closure.<eos> It didn't.
Lee Henry dropped a tire iron on it. Yeah, why would Lee Henry have a tire iron?<eos> Those days are coming, Dad.<eos> Huh. Anyone hear news on the boy?<eos> The bleed is resolved, but they had to put a shunt in to reduce brain swelling.<eos> Sounds bad.<eos> She said it was a routine procedure.<eos> Uh, hey, Otis.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> I don't know if Joe said what happened.<eos> Yeah, yeah, he did.
Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Stop cheating, Toni<eos> It's painful at the end.<eos> As you got cheated, I do not worry, replay.<eos> 2.<eos> Where is she?<eos> You did what?<eos> You did what?<eos> You did what?
You're...<eos> The mad hag who was locked in the tower. I almost didn't recognize you out of your chains.<eos> You're the one that's hard to recognize... both of you.<eos> This isn't who you are.<eos> Tell me...<eos> who are we?<eos> You're my parents.<eos> I'm the product of your true love.<eos> You taught me how to be a hero, you taught me how to believe in hope.<eos> And I do.
Nah, I'll take public service.<eos> From here?<eos> You don't want to do that.<eos> Look, I'll put the cuffs back on you and you can ride in the back.<eos> Cuffs or not, I'm keeping my distance from you, Lasalle.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Let's just say your reputation precedes you.<eos> My reputation?<eos> Have we had a bad date I don't recall?<eos> No, but a friend of mine did.
I sure do.<eos> Or you can roll the dice and spread them out.<eos> But you're not getting anymore without seeing me again.<eos> One more thing.<eos> These episodes are going to keep happening until you accept the fact that Donna may never come back.<eos> MIKE: Where the hell have you been all morning?<eos> What are you, my mother?<eos> I was in a meeting.<eos> Why? Remember when you said Katzen was going to wait until the last second to hold us over a barrel?<eos> Well, they didn't.
But lucky for you, we told them that if they force you into bankruptcy, that doesn't necessarily kill your company. But buying your name does. So, they own me?<eos> That's your brilliant solution?<eos> No, they own the Slattery trademark, which they think effectively puts you under.<eos> But they don't know what we know.<eos> And what is that?<eos> That you have another contract that doesn't care about the name of your company.<eos> They only care about the name of the owner.<eos> How the hell did Katzen even know to sell their debt?<eos> Because I made a mistake.<eos> You sure as hell did!
I haven't touched one since college, and even then it was just to look under it for my keys.<eos> Max, take him off set.<eos> Be professional.<eos> How professional can I be?<eos> She's asking me to fluff his nutter.<eos> Yo, Nash!<eos> So...<eos> Marie.<eos> Did Joe tell you about my big new job promotion?<eos> Of course she did.
Three bottles of wine.<eos> Okay, but you do remember the dancing?<eos> The singing?<eos> Oh, tell me you remember the singing, because it was amazing.<eos> I sang?<eos> [Both laugh] Come on, let's get you into bed.<eos> Oh, go get in bed.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> 48 hours to shut down the case.<eos> And if we don't?
I tried to stop the bleeding, but there was... there was so much blood.<eos> I'm gonna need you to stay right there.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Is that who I think it is? The mayor's wife?<eos> Yes.<eos> All right Marcus tell us what happend.<eos> We were here in the bed, and we heard someone come in the back door.<eos> Figured it was her husband.<eos> - You said he went in early.<eos> - He did.
Look, there are larger issues at play here.<eos> If Mrs. Grant gets elected to the Senate, she would enjoy improper privilege and wield undue influence on her husband, the President of the United States.<eos> It's a conflict of interest.<eos> Mrs. Grant's relationship with the president would remain exactly the same, whether she's a senator or not, no privilege, no influence.<eos> You seem bitter.<eos> Do I?<eos> Yes. You do.<eos> Why would I... because you know that you would make a better senate candidate than Mrs. Grant.<eos> - Did I say that?<eos> - You did... with your eyes.
Okay, Amy has been restricted to the ship.<eos> For something called "conduct unbecoming." Whatever that means.<eos> According to the uniform code of military justice, that could mean any number of things... making a rude remark, using foul language...<eos> Sneezing at the wrong time.<eos> There has to be some way we can get Amy out of there.<eos> What about emergency medical leave?<eos> Sure, if Amy had a dead relative whose funeral she had to attend, for example.<eos> What about a sick relative? One she had to leave the ship to visit?<eos> That works, too, but Amy doesn't have a sick relative.<eos> Actually, she does.
Nolan Ross.<eos> Friend of your father's.<eos> It only took 10 years to return the favor.<eos> I was kind of hoping you'd have to repay this one never.<eos> Two years ago, I never would've thought I'd have... A partner in all this, or a real friend.<eos> Now that's a revenge all-star opportunity.<eos> What do you have on tap?<eos> A long summer of fun.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I do...
- I'm Amanda.<eos> I'll come back for you.<eos> I promise.<eos> It's nice to see you again.<eos> Sammy.<eos> He's home.<eos> He was a really good friend.<eos> You two belong together.<eos> And deep down, she knows it.<eos> Does she?
And another 20 pounds since.<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> You know, I can lose weight.<eos> There ain't no cure for ugly. Okay?<eos> That was dirty.<eos> That was dirty.<eos> So... so how are you guys celebrating tomorrow?<eos> Well, it's kind of still up in the air, but we're gonna start out with a nice long hike, and then have a little breakfast picnic.<eos> Aw. That sounds nice.<eos> What you gonna do after that?
She'd say she'd... rather lie awake together than... than to sleep without me there, you know.<eos> I'm-I'm sorry about your wrist.<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> Why don't you go back to sleep.<eos> Captain Grover, thank you for coming.<eos> All right, Max, what do you got?<eos> Well, as I suspected, the C.O.D. was blunt force trauma to the head and torso caused by the fall.<eos> But I didn't find evidence of foul play.<eos> Well, yeah, but you didn't find anything that proves that she wasn't pushed, right?<eos> No, I didn't.
Sure.<eos> So, what are you saying, you should've done something else?<eos> Stayed here?<eos> Sold tractors off the 5?<eos> You got nothing to complain about.<eos> Yeah.<eos> God, it feels so good to just sit here and do the wrong thing with you.<eos> Well, I don't want to keep you.<eos> I'm sure you got better things to do than sit in the back of a truck and just listen to me babble on.<eos> Yeah, actually I do.
What's happening?<eos> I just need to talk to him.<eos> You know where he is?<eos> No, but I'm sure he'll be back.<eos> Are you?<eos> What?<eos> Sure he'll come back.<eos> Oh, he's definitely coming back.<eos> Print matched?<eos> Indeed it did.
She laughed to protect you, Mom, because it's not the truth.<eos> I'm the one who turned the water on.<eos> I turned it on all the way because Evie was crying so loud and she didn't want you to hear.<eos> She was crying because we didn't know why our father was gone.<eos> Or why he did what he did.<eos> But she was crying so loud.<eos> So I turned the water on and I drowned her out.<eos> Until she could pretend she was okay.<eos> Nobody disappeared from here on October 14th four years ago.<eos> But they did before.
Okay, I'll send him right away.<eos> All right. Great.<eos> Thank you. I'll see you soon.<eos> Man, I think you need to call somebody.<eos> Yep, already did.<eos> This better be important, man.<eos> Julie would kill me if she find out I was back over here.<eos> Relax, all right?<eos> Me and the boys cooked up something special for you.<eos> Or this guy did.
I don't even remember what that tastes like.<eos> - Tastes like pizza.<eos> - No go on the safe zone.<eos> Run by good people, but there's not enough of them, and they're starting to hear rumors about the immunes themselves.<eos> Can't risk leaving a bunch of teenagers there.<eos> They'll be our guests for now.<eos> How are we looking with those prisoners?<eos> Still not talking yet, but they will.<eos> Meantime, something came up while you were gone.<eos> Usually does.
I really do.<eos> But I am the verge of a major breakthrough. And every minute that I'm not working is a minute...<eos> I hear you, too, Dr. Scott.<eos> Nevertheless, I have to do this.<eos> The more you argue, the longer it will take, so...<eos> Tell me again, when did you first notice Niels take a turn for the worse?<eos> Sir, we fished an I.V. bag out of the trash.<eos> The tube still had the blood on it from when Niels ripped it out of his arm.<eos> And? Every bag prepared in the medical bay should have the patient's name, medication, and Doc Rios' signature.<eos> This one didn't.
- Excuse me. - Hey.<eos> Amelia...<eos> We did everything we could.<eos> Come on.<eos> We should have done it your way from the beginning.<eos> We should have started there.<eos> She would be better off.<eos> That is not true. Her defect...<eos> My approach made things worse.<eos> No, it didn't.
- Okay.<eos> And when it's bad, it hurts so much.<eos> Hey, can we talk?<eos> Uh, actually, I was just...<eos> What's really going on?<eos> I need you to tell me, 'cause...<eos> You say one thing, and I think you mean something else entirely, and I want to understand.<eos> I am trying to.<eos> Because I want what we started here.<eos> I do.
- What is she doing here?<eos> - I invited her.<eos> Victoria, I beg you, do not let that woman into your life.<eos> Well, someone has to lighten the mood around here.<eos> You're about as depressing as a yankee groom at a Southern wedding.<eos> You tried to kill me, you lunatic.<eos> Okay, whatever did or did not happen was due to the fact that my family was drugging me.<eos> Former family.<eos> Victoria, please, you don't need her kind of help.<eos> Oh, the hell she doesn't.
There's nothing left to say, Nolan.<eos> I told her how I felt. She made it clear she didn't want to be with me.<eos> Look, it's time I faced reality.<eos> She never wanted me to be a part of this, anyway.<eos> Only because she was protecting you.<eos> She loves you, Jack.<eos> I can't hear that right now.<eos> And I certainly didn't hear it from her.<eos> We both know that what Emily says and what Emily feels are two very different things.<eos> Yes, we do.
At the moment.<eos> Mitch is examining a bat.<eos> He discovered an abnormality in its eye.<eos> I swear to God, I am gonna kill that man before this is over. Yeah, I...<eos> I may beat you to it.<eos> And Abraham... he has his dark places,<eos> Oui.<eos> Yeah. Perhaps someday he'll tell you about it.<eos> - So did you find Leo Butler?<eos> - Yeah, we did.
- Where did you get this?<eos> - From your closet.<eos> I didn't know I still had it.<eos> You know I love Justin, Mom, - right?<eos> - I know.<eos> But... do you think - if I got really bad...<eos> - Baby. - ... that he would come?<eos> - Clementine. - Do you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
That's the one I'm gonna buy.<eos> And I'm gonna name her Ventus, - which is the Latin word for wind.<eos> - Wow. Beautiful.<eos> You'll have to take me for a sail sometime.<eos> You don't have to work the charm thing anymore.<eos> You-you got what you came for.<eos> Leo, I'm forever grateful for what you did.<eos> And I 100% want to go for a sail with you when this is all over.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Long story.<eos> There you are. I've been looking all over for you.<eos> Sorry. I had some calls I had to make.<eos> You okay?<eos> 'Cause to be honest, you got me and the squints kind of worried here.<eos> Why?<eos> Did Bones call you or something?<eos> No, we're just all concerned because for some crazy reason we care about you.<eos> Okay, well, maybe you should be more concerned that we don't have a motive or a suspect.<eos> Well, we do now.
Sounds like the rats are restless.<eos> Ugh. Like, actual torture.<eos> Elena and Damon talking about their future together.<eos> Echh. Just... I want to die.<eos> They'll make a mistake eventually, and when they do, we will pounce and drain the first person we can get our teeth on.<eos> What I would do for just a sip of human blood.<eos> You know when you're feeding on someone's neck and their artery's still pulsing?<eos> I really love that.<eos> I thought your veins felt like sandpaper.<eos> They do.
Yeah.<eos> That's because your life has purpose again.<eos> It's finite, and it's...<eos> Pretty much the greatest feeling in the whole world.<eos> I made you guys some amazing drinks with a little bit of Tequila.<eos> Ok.<eos> A lot of Tequila.<eos> And there's only one of you.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - I didn't do anything.
Our men will balk.<eos> Which is why I'm going to lead the charge.<eos> And don't let them form up again.<eos> Keep them on the run.<eos> Where is condÃ©?<eos> Find him!<eos> Did you...?<eos> A physician is coming to bind his wound.<eos> When you left last night, you had all this in mind.<eos> Didn't you?
Hello.<eos> Is Kirsten home?<eos> Why no, she is not.<eos> Liam?<eos> I knew there was no point in trying to surprise you, but I hope you're happy to see me.<eos> Of course I am.<eos> Come in.<eos> But I have to go.<eos> I don't.<eos> Yes, we do.
- and find out what we can. - No, I'm...<eos> I can't see Dale.<eos> With her.<eos> We have to go.<eos> People saw us in those caves.<eos> If we don't show up, they'll come looking.<eos> Is it possible I'm pregnant?<eos> I don't think so, hon.<eos> It felt so real.<eos> It still does.
- Uh, just... think about it.<eos> And... do you think you could find your nephew?<eos> I didn't see him here.<eos> She called you "Dale."<eos> Julia, I said I don't want to talk about it.<eos> The woman you had a relationship with is suddenly here, in the flesh.<eos> Of course I have questions.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Come on.<eos> Yeah, to keep the freaks with glazed eyes away and to kill her if she ever becomes one of them herself.<eos> I'm not gonna let that happen.<eos> Okay?<eos> Screw you for ruining a perfect day.<eos> I love you.<eos> What did you just say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You just said that you love me.<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, a piglet, actually, so there's only enough for a few VIPs.<eos> We'll make it our secret.<eos> I have to prioritize, which doesn't always sit well with the people who think they're getting the short end of the stick.<eos> I underestimated you, Pete.<eos> You're a man who listens to his instincts and does what he has to do to be heard.<eos> The problem is, is not everyone respects your initiative.<eos> Barbie knows that you cut the beams in the ceiling, that you're responsible for the deaths<eos> - of those two people.<eos> - What? I had nothing to do with that.<eos> Of course you did.
Don't you know what this means? Do you?<eos> We have a way to fight back.<eos> A way to fight the kinship. Pack your stuff.<eos> As soon as the coast is clear, we're leaving.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> To find Julia.<eos> That damn meteor probably took out half the country.<eos> We don't know if what happened outside happened everywhere.<eos> We need to contact the outside world.<eos> Oh, do we?
You know he was a mess.<eos> Couldn't even take care of himself.<eos> I never knew what it felt like to be safe or in love until I met Barbie.<eos> And look how that worked out.<eos> Such a cliché, right?<eos> Falling for the dark, mysterious guy and... then get all bent out of shape when he turns out to be dark and mysterious.<eos> two former enemies drinking at the end of the world. "Former"?<eos> Oh, come on, Jim.<eos> You must have regrets.<eos> Yeah, course I do.
Lead the way.<eos> Oh, my God, the dust is so thick.<eos> You can't even see the sun.<eos> It's like it was before.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Remember...<eos> Remember what?<eos> The Great Destruction.<eos> It's happening all over again.<eos> Like it did on our home world.
But he's just as guilty as the rest of them.<eos> With only one amethyst remaining, adjustments will have to be made, and I need Joe's help.<eos> What about Sam?<eos> I went back to the bomb shelter.<eos> He wasn't there.<eos> I gave Sam a choice:<eos> He can either live among us, or... die with the Resistance.<eos> Christine?<eos> I thought the cocoon healed you.<eos> It did.
Yeah.<eos> What about Joe?<eos> We should go after him.<eos> Newsflash... we're being hunted.<eos> We just have to sit tight.<eos> No one said you could stay.<eos> This is my safe house.<eos> That's a hell of a way to thank the man that just saved your life.<eos> I don't owe you squat.<eos> Actually, you do.
Christine enslaved most of the town and tried to kill us all.<eos> Now-now you're saying that she's a good guy.<eos> How do we know the two of you aren't Life Forcing it up? I was never cocooned.<eos> I'm human, remember?<eos> I wouldn't have brought Christine here if I thought she was dangerous.<eos> If I wasn't certain she was one of us now.<eos> She's here to help us find my daughter.<eos> Is Dr. Bloom still working on the umbilical cord?<eos> When Hektor went after Joe, it wasn't just me who tried to stop him.<eos> Dr. Bloom did, too.
I guarantee I am.<eos> Maybe I didn't exactly die back there, but I... I sure as hell could have.<eos> I did look up from my car today. I did see a plane coming toward me.<eos> And for a split second, I did find myself thinking,<eos> "maybe this is it.<eos> This is where it all ends on 37th street between a yarn shop and a falafel stand."<eos> I know what a near-death experience is, and this wasn't my first.<eos> And it's true.<eos> Your life flashes right before your eyes.<eos> And this morning, mine did.
She just had surgery.<eos> She should not be out of bed.<eos> - I know. I thought that if she saw...<eos> - No, I disagree.<eos> These are not the actions of someone who thinks.<eos> - This is someone...<eos> I'm sorry. I know I'm supposed to keep it down, but...<eos> We had sandwiches.<eos> Wait... you did?<eos> We did.
Yeah, that's right.<eos> So take this broom and help me.<eos> Whoo! Shots fired, New York.<eos> I cannot stop playing this one.<eos> You already know this... That exclusive Lucious Lyon joint.<eos> Classic Empire for you, baby. Right here.<eos> He dropped that from prison?<eos> How?<eos> Your daddy, he has his ways.<eos> He always did.
It's gonna be called The Artist.<eos> It's basically kind of a manifesto of everything I want to become.<eos> You know, it's easy to lose yourself in all of this and running Empire. But this is home.<eos> Doing this, this is what I do. It makes me happy.<eos> Sir, uh, I'm sorry to bother you, but we have a serious situation here.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> FBI.<eos> We have a warrant.<eos> Your warrant does not give you the right to ransack my father's office.<eos> In fact, it does.
It could be anywhere!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Look, man, I'm sorry. I...<eos> I don't even know what to say.<eos> My brother's always had a bad temper.<eos> And he's a spoiled brat, but I feel horrible.<eos> Don't. Don't feel horrible.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's not okay, he ruined your work.<eos> No, he-he didn't.
He asked me to take care of a few things.<eos> You on the payroll now?<eos> I'm replacing Vernon.<eos> No one can replace Vernon.<eos> Yeah, you're right about that. But there is work to do.<eos> Uh, Lucious asked me to look into, uh, Anita Calhoun.<eos> Anika Calhoun.<eos> Anika, yeah.<eos> She doesn't work for Lyon Dynasty, right?<eos> Never did.
- You tell me.<eos> I heard Big Heavy and his boys came and paid us a visit?<eos> I can't have them boys coming around here, making my girls nervous.<eos> I feel you, all right? But I took care of it.<eos> They're not gonna come back again.<eos> Good.<eos> Look, man, I know I've been hard on you.<eos> My label is my life.<eos> My mom, she deserves the best.<eos> She does. As do you.
You know, they want you to be in, like, you know, you're black or you're white, or you're pop or you're soul.<eos> You know, just fit in that little... Yeah, but throw that box away.<eos> Burn that box. You know what I'm saying? You don't need it.<eos> You know why I really want to work with you?<eos> 'Cause, um, you're my super fan.<eos> I mean, obviously, I'm the OG super fan. I mean, obviously.<eos> It's more than that.<eos> It's 'cause you're so much more.<eos> You know, like, you got all this amazingness that you think that you got to keep hidden.<eos> You don't.
[laughs] What?<eos> I used to want this so bad.<eos> Why?<eos> Dad got it for mom in Paris.<eos> She'd wear it whenever she got really dressed up.<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Mm, I think it was before my time.<eos> It was the most beautiful thing in the world.<eos> I wanted to wear it to prom, But mom said I'd lose it.<eos> Yeah, of course she did.
(Natalie) you're gonna go to jail for the rest of your life.<eos> [speaking Russian] (Natalie) make sure to get it in writing.<eos> Just hurry up and get here, okay?<eos> I love you too, baby.<eos> (Sarah) what was that about? Don't be afraid, okay?<eos> But there are men outside, Really bad men, Who want to hurt us.<eos> The FBI agents?<eos> (Natalie) no, they're not FBI.<eos> They're SVR. (Sarah) oh, my god, we have to call the cops.<eos> No, we don't.
You know what I mean?<eos> Maybe I snapped and, uh, I lashed out at the first person that I saw.<eos> Mr. Karras-- because this is the only way that it makes sense.<eos> At your lawyer's insistence, the Maine police ran a rape kit on you.<eos> There was no evidence of assault, sexual or otherwise.<eos> Ok, well, run another rape kit.<eos> No rope burns on your arms or legs.<eos> No evidence of a break-in at all.<eos> What you guys trying to tell me, that this didn't happen to me?<eos> 'Cause it did!
Thought you had an office for that.<eos> I do, but I can stay in touch with the phone and the computer.<eos> I don't need no damn babysitter.<eos> You're enjoying this, aren't you?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> The hell you aren't.<eos> You're mad because I've never forgiven you for what happened.<eos> And now this is payback.<eos> Roy, this has nothing to do with the past.<eos> The hell it doesn't.
I see her in his eyes.<eos> Small things he does.<eos> I see it, too.<eos> You and me, we're not good, you know.<eos> I'll never forgive you for what happened.<eos> I wish you didn't feel that way.<eos> Oh, don't be so understanding.<eos> For once, take the low road and tell me to take a hike.<eos> I think about what Haley would want for this family.<eos> Well, I do, too.
Markayla:<eos> Like 10 minutes ago.<eos> [text message tone] hurry up, we're late.<eos> It's kate. She's back in town.<eos> You would hate it more if we missed this 4for1 concert.<eos> And bobby is hot, so you know he has cute friends.<eos> He'd better.<eos> He does. Now text her back Before she starts worrying.<eos> She's totally gonna know I'm lying.<eos> She always does.
Got released?<eos> No.<eos> He went AWOL yesterday.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Where'd he go? No idea.<eos> You a sniper like him?<eos> Female Engagement Team, yeah.<eos> Connor used to talk about it.<eos> Killing somebody from a distance... didn't feel real.<eos> Until... it did.
Right up until... he was murdered last month.<eos> I recognized him when I saw the news.<eos> He came to see me after what happened to Patrick.<eos> And he questioned you?<eos> I didn't know he was a driver for the company.<eos> He said he was a reporter. He was both.<eos> We believe he started driving because he was digging into Zooss.<eos> What did he want to know?<eos> Mostly about Patrick's job, like if I knew about any problems Patrick had at work.<eos> I didn't.
Apparently, you were just named Spring Dance Princess somehow.<eos> Mm-hmm, what am I always telling you guys?<eos> I'm royalty.<eos> All right, listen up.<eos> We go in strong and we go in fast.<eos> Evans, you're on door breach.<eos> Patterson... flashbang.<eos> Boyle, stop squatting like that.<eos> Sorry, I thought it looked cool.<eos> - It didn't.
If I had known, this all would have played out very differently.<eos> Still, there had to be another way.<eos> There wasn't.<eos> I mean, for God's sake, what was I supposed to do?<eos> Interrogate him?<eos> Justin was former C.I.A. You know how you guys are.<eos> Conditioned not to crack.<eos> He had our algorithms.<eos> He was going to post them for the world to see.<eos> And if he did?
- She made everything up.<eos> - She make up the Ponzi scheme?<eos> The 128 million you stole from your clients to fund your lifestyle.<eos> - The ranch, the private jets--<eos> - I've told this story before.<eos> We were sleeping together.<eos> She had access to everything my phone, computer, passwords.<eos> If you don't believe me--<eos> We want to believe you.<eos> We do.
- Oh, my God! You were gonna leave Todd in the desert?<eos> Oh... oh, so you're gonna believe him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Tandy...<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Fine. I was gonna leave Todd in the desert.<eos> Is that what you want to hear?<eos> Well, it's true.<eos> But I-I didn't do it!
Do you understand?<eos> See, this, all this, it's just a process.<eos> You know, the system.<eos> But it's done.<eos> We're not idiots, Ms. Hills.<eos> And, you know, it's actually a very easy storyline to follow.<eos> You become buddy-buddy with Marla Finch from group and, you know, yes, that was a terrible, terrible thing that happened to her.<eos> Then the boyfriend walks and you snap.<eos> I understand that.<eos> I honestly do.
Thanks to their long lenses and meticulous note-taking, we may have a person of interest... a man by the name of Collin Eisely.<eos> I'm sorry, I need to catch up a little, here.<eos> Have I been under police surveillance?<eos> No, those were taken by someone who was interested in that man, Garrison Boyd.<eos> We have hundreds of photographs of him, in all manner of activities,<eos> Those, however, are the only ones where he appears to be in heated altercation with a man two days before he was murdered.<eos> This guy was murdered?<eos> Last night.<eos> Do you want to tell us how you knew him?<eos> I didn't.
It's a plane ticket Arn purchased under a false name.<eos> Turns out he flew to Prague three weeks ago.<eos> I'm guessing he wasn't sight-seeing.<eos> I figured, where's the best place to meet criminals?<eos> Prison, right?<eos> So, I checked Arn's records to see if he did any time with Czech inmates.<eos> David and Aleksandr Brosnek.<eos> Cocaine traffickers operating from Prague.<eos> Cocaine traffickers?<eos> Anything to do with narcoterrorism?
Autopsy's in back.<eos> Only one way in and out.<eos> Tactical goes in there, it's gonna be a turkey shoot.<eos> And protocol says wait until there's an imminent threat.<eos> Guess those documents fit their bill.<eos> Let me ask you this.<eos> Is there any chance that the file on his brother's death, the one Martel requested, is on the flash drive that Armstrong smuggled in?<eos> Probably not.<eos> Didn't have any access.<eos> But we do.
Yeah.<eos> And what about what Nathan needed?<eos> Hmm? He goes off and he dies for his country, and they won't tell me nothing about what happened to him.<eos> He was my best friend.<eos> The only one who ever believed in me.<eos> Nate.<eos> Little Nate with the... bright eyes and the... crazy smile.<eos> A smile I will never see again.<eos> We understand, Marcus.<eos> You don't.
Pacetti knew this.<eos> Look at it and you'll see, I didn't need to lift a finger.<eos> And when you lift a finger, people die.<eos> Pacetti wasn't worth the trouble.<eos> Carine?<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Headed back to the office.<eos> Arabela and Marco interviewed Lucarelli,<eos> - he claims he's innocent.<eos> - Well, of course he does.
I know that.<eos> She's always the last one to leave the office at night.<eos> And the first one here in the morning.<eos> What is this?<eos> Is this yours?<eos> That is some evidence Marco gave me.<eos> Pertaining to what?<eos> The man who abducted his sister.<eos> Does Carine know about this?<eos> Yeah, she does.
But you have friends here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's the tough part.<eos> You, mostly.<eos> Everything you know is here.<eos> Yeah, but that's just it.<eos> I don't want to know everything in my life.<eos> I want to be surprised.<eos> Don't you?<eos> I do.
He's warming his hands on the ashes of his own stuff.<eos> Shut up, Mani.<eos> You'll give us away.<eos> Veer...he's gone.<eos> Fix it quickly.<eos> King...you're looking really smart<eos> Thank you.<eos> But you would look smarter with your father's favorite car.<eos> Did you find the car?<eos> You didn't, right?
Looking for some fun?<eos> That works.<eos> You're late!<eos> But before we go anywhere, I need to know you can protect me.<eos> And my family.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> I'll make sure your family is, too.<eos> You don't know these people!<eos> You don't know what they can do!<eos> Oh, yeah, we do.
So, who was he?<eos> Well, our male victim's real name was Lieutenant Louis Freston.<eos> I know the name.<eos> Intelligence specialist.<eos> Recently assigned.<eos> Apparently he had cultivated Lolita as an asset.<eos> She has relatives in Colombia who claim to know where our target got his hair cut.<eos> You know, we get a report like this twice a week.<eos> It never pans out.<eos> This one did.
My mother.<eos> Do you know she cried when she thought I was getting this kind of a payout from the sale?<eos> And then she cried again when I had to tell her that it wasn't true.<eos> Do you... do you understand the recklessness of telling those kinds of lies to someone like that?<eos> Who's lying?<eos> These numbers are real.<eos> That's the same acquisition offer tendered to Cameron and the senior staff.<eos> The only new piece of accounting here is what you would personally stand to make.<eos> - A bribe, you mean.<eos> - I just did the math for you.
Clothes are 100% off.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> I know.<eos> Was she was one of the ladies they hit on?<eos> I don't remember seeing her here last night.<eos> Okay, how long did these guys stick around?<eos> I closed their tab around 11:00.<eos> They were pretty wasted, so I called them a cab.<eos> Do you know how hard it is to get the smell of vomit out of pleather?<eos> Thankfully, I do not.
He has access to the entire plane, just like we do.<eos> Runs the length of the plane.<eos> And you looked everywhere?<eos> Well, we didn't pull out all the luggage 'cause there was no sign anyone was down here.<eos> Aah!<eos> There's a snake on the mother-flyin' plane.<eos> You're lucky it wasn't the pit bulls we had to ship last week.<eos> Look at this luggage.<eos> Since when does the airline allow clothes hanging out of bags?<eos> They don't, not usually.
It isn't a crime to give a gift.<eos> Oh, so it's a gift now?<eos> To someone that you don't even know?<eos> What were you paying the air marshal for, Mr. Dietrich?<eos> This has been delightful, but I'm afraid I have to go.<eos> Um, no.<eos> You're...<eos> you're not going anywhere.<eos> You have no cause to hold me.<eos> Actually, we do.
...about how they found plans and journals in Andrew's house at the farm where he left the van.<eos> Andrew Campbell and Charles DiLaurentis are the same person.<eos> That's what we're saying, right?<eos> We're not just saying it, it's reality.<eos> Reality's been through a lot, and so have we.<eos> You guys, it makes perfect sense.<eos> 'Andrew's always just been there on the edge of things.' 'Always there, helping.'<eos> Makes me sick just thinking about it.<eos> So when do we tell the police about Charles?<eos> - We don't.
Andrew Campbell and Charles DiLaurentis are the same person.<eos> That's what we're saying, right?<eos> We're not just saying it, it's reality.<eos> Reality's been through a lot, and so have we.<eos> You guys, it makes perfect sense.<eos> 'Andrew's always just been there on the edge of things.' 'Always there, helping.'<eos> Makes me sick just thinking about it.<eos> So when do we tell the police about Charles?<eos> - We don't.<eos> - We don't?
- So are you new in town?<eos> - Newish.<eos> Lorenzo is part of Rosewood PD's fresh perspective.<eos> That's me.<eos> I spoke to Spencer this morning.<eos> Good.<eos> Yeah, she seems okay.<eos> You know, physically.<eos> They went through a lot.<eos> We all did.
Patricia Levin.<eos> Regional leadership of the Guilty Remnant.<eos> - She went by Patti.<eos> - Did you kill her?<eos> No, I disinterred her body.<eos> You know who did kill her?<eos> She killed herself, but I was...<eos> So she killed herself?<eos> Yes, but I was responsible for...<eos> Yes, she did.
He's been depressed.<eos> What you diagnosed as endogenous depression.<eos> It's what killed your relationship.<eos> And you have a child together.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Do you believe me now?<eos> Why don't you tell me.<eos> You don't know what it's like to be abducted.<eos> To be taken against your will. You don't know.<eos> Well... maybe you do.
We have, uh, witnesses who say he's your cousin.<eos> He's a stranger, someone we let into our home.<eos> So you must know where he went.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Lebanon.<eos> He's going to Lebanon.<eos> Kasim.<eos> Tell me why I shouldn't tell them.<eos> I owe Khalil nothing.<eos> None of us do.
You leave.<eos> _<eos> And then after a while, he asked me if I wanted to come in.<eos> What did you talk about?<eos> How Kyle was doing.<eos> Glenn got him a tutor over the summer.<eos> And then he asked me if I was coming home.<eos> Sounds like you're surprised.<eos> I didn't think he'd want me to.<eos> But he does.
I promise, she won't even see me.<eos> It'll be like I'm not even there.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are you doing? Nothing.<eos> There was a...<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Jill's happy.<eos> - Did she take my letter?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did.
We can strip it away, but once it's gone, we have nothing to put back in its place.<eos> Well, let's give them something.<eos> Therapists have a lot of rules.<eos> Only one really matters:<eos> don't talk about yourself.<eos> I spent the first weeks after the Departure just waiting.<eos> I'm still waiting.<eos> We all are.<eos> I had a patient who said she could feel that something terrible was gonna happen.<eos> And it did.
All the time.<eos> Did he ever tell you what that "S" means?<eos> The House of El.<eos> Yes, but, it also stands for a Kryptonian phrase, our family motto.<eos> "El mayarah."<eos> It means, "Stronger together."<eos> You say people will see me the way they see Superman one day, but...<eos> I don't want to be a hero like him.<eos> My cousin, he's so used to going it alone, he doesn't know any other way.<eos> But I do.
We have to stop her.<eos> I have to be ready for her next time.<eos> Show me how to fight.<eos> Train me to be as good as you.<eos> I'll make you even better.<eos> On Krypton, I remember Aunt Astra and my mother always arguing.<eos> Like sisters do.<eos> And when I asked my mother why they could never get along, she said that it was because Astra didn't have faith in people.<eos> You wanted to know if I have faith in you.<eos> I do.
It's the questions the DSD wants to ask you.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> I borrowed it.<eos> That man, the agent isn't going to leave you alone.<eos> I wanted you to have it so you could see there's nothing to be scared of.<eos> I'm scared?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of what?<eos> You're scared that if you answer these questions, everyone's gonna know that your daughter didn't depart.<eos> She didn't?
Thank you.<eos> Sorry about that, sir.<eos> Now how can I help you?<eos> Did you drink the water?<eos> The... but I was... I was so thirsty.<eos> Okay.<eos> She locked me out.<eos> Looks like you're locked out, too.<eos> You want a drink?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Knock, knock.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Broken pencil.<eos> Broken pencil who?<eos> Never mind.<eos> It's pointless.<eos> I'm Evie.<eos> Meg.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't find whatever you were looking for here.<eos> No one ever does.
But you wouldn't know that.<eos> You've never killed a human with your bare hands.<eos> You send soldiers to battle and use the Amphorae, but it's not the same.<eos> You don't know the beauty of it.<eos> In winter, when blood spills on snow, it steams.<eos> You're insane.<eos> Michael.<eos> You think I'm just gonna stand by and watch you kill yourself?<eos> I have to.<eos> One of us does.
So am I.<eos> You've let a false prophet take advantage of your fear.<eos> But I hear God's voice.<eos> We all do.<eos> But I don't!<eos> And if it were Father, I promise He would have something to say to me!<eos> I'm one of his children too.<eos> Michael, I have a responsibility.<eos> That mean anything to you?<eos> It did... once.
We've got to go get Rachel, so we better get going.<eos> I'll be right up!<eos> Don't be long, sweetheart, okay?<eos> Sarah?<eos> Are you coming?<eos> We've got to get going.<eos> I'm coming!<eos> I'm happy that Rachel is taking you on this trip.<eos> You've had a rough year.<eos> - We all did.
Well, in the end you were right.<eos> And think of all the girls who were saved. Yeah.<eos> A website for serial killers.<eos> Who knew?<eos> You know, a few weeks before my sister died, we went to Virginia Beach for her birthday, just the two of us, and we were laying there and I asked her what she was thinking.<eos> And she said, you know, Kate, if anything ever happens to me or Joe, just promise me that you'll take care of my little girl.<eos> And, I mean, of course I said I would. You know?<eos> Nothing was going to happen to her.<eos> She was 24.<eos> And...just like that, it did.
Sorry.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> He's the one I was telling you about.<eos> The one with the email.<eos> Show him the email.<eos> Please.<eos> He doesn't believe it's true.<eos> Just tell him you have it.<eos> I mean, I...<eos> I do.
Or I'll feel I've spoiled the day, which is the very last thing I'd want to do.<eos> - Furthermore, I want you to keep it.<eos> - Well, I...<eos> I've asked Baxter to fit it for you tonight.<eos> She's happy to do that.<eos> I'd... Very well, m'lady.<eos> I'm very grateful.<eos> I'm not sure when I'll wear it again.<eos> - But you never know.<eos> - You never do.
Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Get up.<eos> Whoa, Gates!<eos> Shit.<eos> - Julian.<eos> - Hey, General.<eos> Or is it Edward now?<eos> 'Cause when you left your post, you left your rank.<eos> I did.
Her teeth were fixed postmortem?<eos> And that is not easy to pull off, given the time frame.<eos> Process normally takes weeks.<eos> Miss Lin's body was only taken two days ago.<eos> According to Danover Labs the order was delivered to a Dr. Henry McGlasson.<eos> I dug a little deeper into this guy and contacted the medical board.<eos> 3230 Kettering Drive.<eos> How'd it go with Reddington?<eos> He have any insights?<eos> No, but I did.
Nothing.<eos> That's why Reddington brought you in.<eos> He knows the Director is advancing the time line.<eos> Plan is to trigger a series of events that will bring us to the brink of another war.<eos> - I didn't tell him.<eos> Leonard Caul.<eos> - Reddington has the Fulcrum.<eos> He has a blueprint outlining our entire infrastructure.<eos> If you leaked operational details, we're done.<eos> I didn't.
Just like Freeman.<eos> These killings could have a ritualistic component.<eos> We found three more bodies where Connor was being held captive.<eos> Two of them had connections to Rockwell, one we're still waiting on.<eos> Listen to me, Alex, if you run, they're not gonna believe you.<eos> You need to talk to them now.<eos> Rockwell?<eos> He has a knife in the car!<eos> I don't have a clear shot.<eos> I do.
Call me right back.<eos> It'sAlicia.<eos> Leaveamessage.<eos> Baby, call me back.<eos> Call me back right away.<eos> - Try the house. - Yeah.<eos> There's been a massive spike in the officer-related shootings in the last 48 hours.<eos> Nick, stop, please.<eos> Andpeopleactlikethis doesn't change everything.<eos> It does.
Go on.<eos> There was a man shot like the others, like the rest, but he... he wasn't sick.<eos> And there were others like that.<eos> When I was young, these men... these men were from the government.<eos> They came to our town and they took some people away.<eos> And my father was someone of certain importance in the community, so he went to speak to the captain and asked, "When will they return?"<eos> And the captain told my father,<eos> "Miguel, don't worry.<eos> They always come home."<eos> And they did.
You don't want him hurt or you don't want to know?<eos> You took three of my people, sir.<eos> I quarantine at-risk elements of the local populace.<eos> At risk for what?<eos> How long are you planning on keeping them?<eos> Well, you got to take that up with lady doctor Exner.<eos> It's her show.<eos> - Fine.<eos> How do I talk to her?<eos> - You don't.
And so do I.<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> No food or drink shall be consumed until its safety can be confirmed.<eos> Take it back.<eos> You believe Her Highness is poisoned?<eos> I believe many things.<eos> I believe this palace is a symbol of our king, of his power, of his country, and our enemies have stopped at nothing to destroy it.<eos> Since the first stone was laid in this expansion, His Majesty knew this day would come.<eos> So, do I believe that our enemies would dare to poison King Charles of England's sister?<eos> Yes, I do.
Navy ship can't hide long in these waters.<eos> We've picked up radio chatter from over a dozen boats in the area.<eos> American civilians are closing in at the mouths of all the canals between us and the open sea...<eos> Here, here, here, and here.<eos> We're completely surrounded.<eos> They're forming a blockade... Trying to force us toward the sub.<eos> How do you know where they are?<eos> I accessed the Deadman Network and plotted the position of all the phones.<eos> I thought only the immunes had the deadman game.<eos> They do.
We're so pleased to see you.<eos> I want to hear all about Hillcroft.<eos> Why did you first get involved?<eos> Naturally I'd be happy to take as much of the credit as possible, but it was really Mrs Harding's idea.<eos> What was it that drew you to the work they were doing?<eos> Forgive me, but have we met?<eos> I don't think we've met exactly.<eos> Tell us more about Hillcroft.<eos> Well, you see, I never had any higher education - and so...<eos> - Who did?
Fine, move it!<eos> Sebastian, I need an ambulance to my GPS signal.<eos> - Is he OK?<eos> - Barely.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I don't know how to say this, so, I'm just... going to be direct.<eos> Are you aware that your husband kept secrets from you?<eos> You mean... did I know that he slept with men?<eos> For a long time I didn't.
Not necessarily.<eos> 40 pounds of concentrated opiate can be cut and processed into 300 pounds of street-grade horse.<eos> Now, even the largest cartels lack the facilities to perform that kind of alchemy overnight.<eos> It's hard to imagine Escanso and Turk were working for a cartel.<eos> The big syndicates have their own pipelines.<eos> They wouldn't waste time planning a one-off score like this, with amateurs.<eos> Amateurs have to sell to professionals eventually.<eos> Well, the DEA should have a list of cartels that can handle that kind of weight.<eos> You two feel like knocking on the doors of a few drug lords this afternoon?<eos> Yes, I do indeed.
I mean, he-he was a...<eos> he was a good friend.<eos> He knew Annie and I's story and... knew how desperate I was.<eos> So when you questioned him, he, uh... he asked me to come to his house.<eos> He-he asked me if I took the baby.<eos> And I just... I... I lost it.<eos> I...<eos> We fought and...<eos> Well, you know how it ended.<eos> I do, Phil.
- Is this supposed to, uh...<eos> One second.<eos> We're still working out some of the... Jesse, what the hell's happening?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What do you mean, you don't know?<eos> Yeah, come in.<eos> Well, how's that for a day?<eos> Just pulled it out of our ass again.<eos> Never gets old.<eos> Yeah. But we do.
Must have stuck to his fingers.<eos> When was the last time you had contact with him?<eos> Five years ago.<eos> After the sting went south, ATF lost all track of Rivers and most of our straw buyers.<eos> Wow, this just gets worse and worse.<eos> Director Vance, I had no idea Rivers was in the DC area.<eos> Keep yourself available, Agent Caffey.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You still trust this guy?<eos> I do.
But they didn't kill my parents.<eos> Rasheed did.<eos> He had already been turned.<eos> I tried to break Rasheed from their control, but it was too late.<eos> So I fled to Kabul.<eos> I went into hiding.<eos> Why help the Marines?<eos> I could not sit back any longer while people like Rasheed tore my country apart.<eos> I needed to fight back.<eos> You did, Qasim.
There more than one of them?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Paula... was this kid fifteenish, tall, maybe Middle Eastern?<eos> Sounds like the boy we saw on campus.<eos> Go ahead, say it.<eos> No need.<eos> Director.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I hope you like Scotch.<eos> Oh! Tonight I do.
Are you here to thank me?<eos> Here to arrest you.<eos> Or you can turn yourself in.<eos> I know, Sasha.<eos> About the port, the trucks, the shipping company.<eos> I'm a businesswoman.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your business is using Navy resources to make the port into a Hellmouth.<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> But Paul Jenks does.
Now!<eos> Pick it up!<eos> Christopher.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What needs to be done, King.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I've wanted this bastard for 20 years.<eos> He doesn't deserve a new start.<eos> You're right.<eos> He doesn't.
We're done in here.<eos> If something bad's abo5t to happen to my city you need to tell me.<eos> This is New Orleans, Dwayne.<eos> Something bad's always happening.<eos> Yousureyou'reokay to do this?<eos> That which does not kill me.<eos> Plus, with Lasalle at the mermaid's funeral, you could use a wingman.<eos> Good morning.<eos> So, you want to see everything that's come in in the last week.<eos> Yes, we do.
Is that what we call the eternal salvation that's ours for the asking?<eos> Is that what we call the Kingdom of Heaven that surrounds us but we're too blind to see?<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> Why can't the Kingdom of Heaven be Saks Fifth Avenue<eos> Help me out here.<eos> Ll, it would be nice to g pedicure, so I could wear sandals.<eos> That's what your soul needs... sandals?<eos> It is what Jesus wore.<eos> We need to pray.<eos> - Do we really?
I don't know, Mom. 'Cause I really think high school's where we went off the rails.<eos> Fine, whatever.<eos> I also wanted to apologize.<eos> It's not your fault about Roscoe.<eos> Him not wanting to be here just broke my heart.<eos> And the only way I could deal with it was by blaming you.<eos> I get it.<eos> My kid looked me in the eye and he said he didn't want to live with me.<eos> Do you have any idea how much that hurts?<eos> Actually, I do.
He's driving it round some track nearby<eos> - at Catterick.<eos> - Testing it, seeing how it handles.<eos> I can take you, if you like.<eos> - Would you?<eos> - I'd like to see it.<eos> - How about you?<eos> - I'll be in London on Wednesday.<eos> - Edith has a date.<eos> - No, I don't.
And it was all a lie.<eos> One big, disgusting lie.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Would you be okay if your entire life you were told something that you saw with your own eyes wasn't real?<eos> I mean, they made me doubt myself.<eos> I've... I've always doubted myself.<eos> At least now we know the truth.<eos> Do we?<eos> 'Cause I'm havin' a hard time believing nobody else in this family knew about Charles.<eos> Somebody did.
Uh, you remember Lorenzo?<eos> - Hey there.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Is this your idea of a replacement?<eos> 'Thought if you lodged a complaint about one cop' you could swap him out for someone closer to your own age?<eos> That's not what I told you.<eos> You claimed that cop insulted you.<eos> - He did.<eos> - Whoa, wait.<eos> - Who did?
What's takin' Hanna so long?<eos> I don't know, she probably has to drag Mona here on a leash.<eos> Oh, Spencer, we saw A jump off a building.<eos> A set up an underground bunker with more spy equipment than the CIA.<eos> I mean, seriously, in your heart do you believe that Lesli Stone could...<eos> People can surprise you.<eos> Mona maintained a 4.0 average and perfect hair while she was tapping Rosewood's police calls.<eos> Spencer, we jumped on the Andrew train...<eos> But he didn't have a motive.<eos> This girl does.
I promise it's not as complicated as I just made it sound.<eos> These days everyone wants a responsive design that adjusts itself to different screens.<eos> So the photo of... Kimye will look the same on your phone, your smart pad, and your computer.<eos> What's Kimye?<eos> Kanye and Kim?<eos> Yeah, right. You wouldn't, uh...<eos> You've been...<eos> You know what actually?<eos> You don't even need to know.<eos> No one does.
No, I just dropped her off at work.<eos> Work?<eos> Sara's got a job?<eos> That's great.<eos> God, if I went through what she did, I don't think I'd remember how to read, never mind be able to...<eos> We all remember how to read.<eos> No, I mean, that..<eos> I'm sorry. I don't know the right thing to say here.<eos> Of course not.<eos> No one does.
You begged me not to go through with it.<eos> You stood in this room and fought with me for days and I still did it.<eos> You thought you had to.<eos> And I was wrong.<eos> Everything we went through, it was all for nothing.<eos> Hell is a very lonely hole in A's dollhouse and maybe I deserved to be there.<eos> What you did was incredibly stupid.<eos> And yeah, I'm pissed as hell at you.<eos> - But that doesn't matter.<eos> - Yes, it does.
Hey, maybe we should swing by Wallaby Avenue.<eos> I heard there's some activity goin' on over there.<eos> Break-ins. - In Sherwood?<eos> - Hmm.<eos> It's not exactly our jurisdiction<eos> Yeah, but there's nothing going on here tonight.<eos> Those guys could use our help anyway.<eos> Hey, come on. The car's over here.<eos> Yeah, and we gotta let Command know we're going.<eos> No, we don't.
You need a sandwich.<eos> Would it help if I were there?<eos> - Where?<eos> - At Spencer's.<eos> The-the barn prom.<eos> I thought you said that you..<eos> Uh, that was when I was gonna be sharing a punch bowl with a bunch of former students.<eos> If you want me there, I will be there.<eos> Unless I have to dress up like a troll or something.<eos> I don't, do I?
I mean, I have been used and abused by that girl more times than I could possibly count.<eos> But she has changed.<eos> She's been through so much.<eos> And she's desperate.<eos> And I know that she needs you.<eos> No, I think she got what she needed.<eos> I think you're wrong.<eos> Alison's never had anyone like you in her whole life.<eos> Somebody who saw something in her that was vulnerable and genuine.<eos> I did..
Are you scared?<eos> Yes.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Okay, the results are in.<eos> And?<eos> - It doesn't make any sense.<eos> - What doesn't?<eos> Barmal designed her serum to block the virus from entering human blood cells.<eos> - So where did she go wrong?<eos> - She didn't.
Forget it.<eos> Sports?<eos> Cameron's too fragile for that.<eos> They thought if I exerted myself, it would kill me.<eos> So this scar is a constant reminder of how fragile life is.<eos> And how fragile my parents thought I was.<eos> Well, I think that you have proven them wrong several times over.<eos> Dr. Barmal killed herself to stop the virus spreading, right?<eos> She assumed the virus would die with her.<eos> Yeah, and it did.
The crimes against humanity that I have seen, the inconceivable harm that I have witnessed people inflicting upon each other, has filled me with an anger that would never allow me to forget.<eos> Me neither.<eos> I devoted my life to seeking justice since my daughter died.<eos> I became aware of our parallel commitment, when I researched your organization.<eos> You have more than two thousand members.<eos> Doctors, teachers, lawyers.<eos> Very impressive what you have achieved.<eos> Mr. Dorn, that's not why you wanted to speak to me.<eos> To tell me you admire my work.<eos> No, no, I did, actually.
I told Agent Keen to run.<eos> You want to know if I'm complicit?<eos> I told her to run.<eos> You're in charge now, Agent Ressler.<eos> And being in charge means you have to decide what to do with information like that.<eos> Now, let my wife go.<eos> Who's this?<eos> My sister Tiffany.<eos> Tiffany lives in Denver.<eos> I did until last month.
What did he say he wants?<eos> You.<eos> He says he wants my father.<eos> Papi, he was holding her, and then he--<eos> Isabella, look at me.<eos> Isabella, I will find her.<eos> I will get her back.<eos> You said the plan was to wait, that it was impossible to cross the perimeter.<eos> Waiting was an option when we had somewhere to wait.<eos> Now we don't.
I'm impressed.<eos> What do you want?<eos> To give you a blacklister.<eos> I'll pass.<eos> The diversion that allowed me to slip past your perimeter, the man who orchestrated that cooked it up in under an hour.<eos> He's an illusionist essential to criminals such as myself, and I am giving him to you.<eos> Where's Keen?<eos> You said you got past the perimeter.<eos> You wouldn't be calling unless she didn't.<eos> No, she didn't.
You don't have a job.<eos> Your words sting, but I know it's because you care.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me...<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Come on.<eos> What's your hurry?<eos> Last time we saw you, you were begging for our protection.<eos> And now you want nothing to do with us.<eos> Don't take it personally.<eos> Or do.
Currently a guard at Victorville Penitentiary.<eos> But back in '08, worked security for one Mr. Arkady Kolcheck.<eos> This could mean Arkady's the one that put the hit out on Patrick Berkeley.<eos> We have an address for Turner?<eos> Already in your phones.<eos> Good job. Keep Callen and Sam in the loop.<eos> Yep.<eos> Hey, guys. You asked if we could find out anything on the hit man that tried to take the Berkeleys out.<eos> Nikolai Brantov?<eos> Unfortunately, we did.
Who?<eos> Used to work security for him.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> All right, clear!<eos> Wait!<eos> You better start knowing, otherwise we're gonna jump-start your memory for you.<eos> Arkady paid me to get some information from an inmate.<eos> Patrick Berkeley.<eos> Why did you kill him?<eos> I didn't.
I don't understand.<eos> What about Mama?<eos> Lady Grantham is to be, and I quote,<eos> "Allowed to step down after so many years of noble service."<eos> Golly.<eos> They've sacked the Captain.<eos> You can see their point.<eos> How could they have someone in the management of the new system who thinks the whole idea is a horrible mistake?<eos> - And you support this notion?<eos> - Of course he does.
You know dealing with emergencies won't be affected.<eos> - Do be logical.<eos> - I am sick and tired of logic!<eos> If I could choose between principle and logic,<eos> I'd take principle every time!<eos> Just tell Cora I do not wish to see her face until I'm used to having a traitor in the family!<eos> Why is she in such a tizzy?<eos> Well, you know mothers.<eos> They get terribly wrought up about things.<eos> - My mum does.
- I am sick and tired of logic!<eos> If I could choose between principle and logic,<eos> I'd take principle every time!<eos> Just tell Cora I do not wish to see her face until I'm used to having a traitor in the family!<eos> Why is she in such a tizzy?<eos> Well, you know mothers.<eos> They get terribly wrought up about things.<eos> - My mum does.<eos> - There you are.<eos> Mine does too.
- Yours when the time comes.<eos> - Hmm, when the time comes.<eos> All you need now are clients. And that'll happen soon enough.<eos> - How's life with the newlyweds?<eos> - Fine, only Mr Carson wants to dine at the cottage again.<eos> No need to sound gloomy.<eos> I can rustle up something.<eos> Whatever you do rustle up, I won't cook it right or the plates will be cold, or the dressing will be wrong.<eos> - Does he appreciate all you do?<eos> - Does any man?
- Oh, while you're there, put in the apple crumble.<eos> Bottom oven.<eos> I think it's been a good day.<eos> The funny thing is, I quite enjoyed it in the end.<eos> I'm glad it's turned out well for Mr Molesley.<eos> - And Andy.<eos> I think that'll turn out well.<eos> - I suppose so.<eos> Even if he only wants to read to learn more about farming from Mr Mason.<eos> And if he does?
So it's a recurring dream?<eos> Okay.<eos> About what?<eos> About when I went missing, I think.<eos> And so why didn't you want to tell me about it?<eos> Probably because I didn't want to make a big deal of it.<eos> But it is a big deal.<eos> You lost two months of your life. And you're dreaming about it now?<eos> - I don't think you should ignore this.<eos> - I do.
Yemen... Somalia.<eos> Yeah, I guess so.<eos> We'll know more when we track down that Chuck Norris look-alike.<eos> How do you plan on doing that?<eos> That military skull tattoo I told you about.<eos> That could help ID him, right?<eos> We'll see what we can find out.<eos> But it's a long shot at best.<eos> I know this seems impossible.<eos> A lot of our cases do at first.
I'm not afraid to hear the truth.<eos> That's right.<eos> You aren't, are you?<eos> Why not let me in?<eos> I wanted to forget everything.<eos> So in my darkest moments, I wonder if I... did something terrible.<eos> I know you.<eos> You would never do anything bad.<eos> I could never leave the love of my life, desert her and you for two months.<eos> And somehow I did.
- Because of Ihab.<eos> Because we were foolish enough to support you.<eos> It's over, so pack your things and leave.<eos> Allahu Akbar.<eos> Allahu Akbar.<eos> Allahu Akbar.<eos> How long will you stay with us?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> You like living here?<eos> Yeah, I do.
She would have had every right to be.<eos> But she wasn't.<eos> She loved you.<eos> She was a Rashid and I was an Al Fayeed.<eos> Even before it started, our relationship was impossible.<eos> We tried to run away together, like in the movies.<eos> To leave Abuddin for good.<eos> I bribed a merchant marine from Mumbai to let us stow away.<eos> We were supposed to meet him at a café, but he never showed up.<eos> My father did, though.
I know she is!<eos> Billy, look at me.<eos> I pulled you out of the fire.<eos> The least you can do is listen to what I have to say.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Listen, Victoria was raped, so whoever set that fire was trying to kill her.<eos> That wasn't me, I swear, I swear...<eos> I know, I know.<eos> So do the police.<eos> They do?
He doesn't care about his presidency, Cyrus.<eos> He only cares about Liv.<eos> What does Liv want him to say?<eos> What does Liv want him to do?<eos> Yeah, what does Liv want him to do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She's gone.<eos> She ran away.<eos> - Then you do know.<eos> - I don't!
What does Liv want him to do?<eos> Yeah, what does Liv want him to do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She's gone.<eos> She ran away.<eos> - Then you do know.<eos> - I don't!<eos> Stop telling me the opposite of what I am telling you.<eos> I am too tired for this!<eos> I don't!
I got this ankle monitor very used from an army-Navy store. And after a few high-tech, highly complicated switcheroos, boom...<eos> The one on your leg should go off-line, and this will become the live monitor and stay here.<eos> And I just walk out the door?<eos> Theoretically.<eos> Okay, look, I know that word doesn't radiate confidence.<eos> Guys, I gotta focus here.<eos> Can I talk to you outside? Sure.<eos> Yeah. Anywhere that's less than 6 feet from the door.<eos> Who knew Victoria had it in her?<eos> Well, I did.
A trail of clues?<eos> It's sloppy. It's not Emily's style.<eos> And we both know she would never take someone's life.<eos> - So what are you insinuating, Jack?<eos> - I'm not insinuating.<eos> I'm saying that it looks like she was set up.<eos> Margaux... If you happen to know something about Victoria's death, now is the time to speak up.<eos> This is a knee-jerk reaction with you to defend Emily no matter what, even when she kills.<eos> Victoria set her up.<eos> She didn't do it alone.
You don't believe me.<eos> You don't think I'm telling the truth.<eos> No, it... It's not that I don't think you're telling the truth.<eos> It's that I don't think you know how to tell the truth.<eos> All right, I don't think there's any difference in your head between the stories that you spin and actual facts.<eos> And that is what makes you dangerous.<eos> Ben, please, listen to me. She is out there.<eos> This one time, I need you to believe me.<eos> I know you do.<eos> But... I don't.
Well, uh... You have it.<eos> I can't imagine leaving Amanda in better hands than yours.<eos> Louise.<eos> Please stop.<eos> I am done listening to you.<eos> You have been using me this whole time.<eos> I am nothing but a pawn to you.<eos> No, poppet, I love you.<eos> I never wanted to hurt you.<eos> But you did.
That come up when you were explaining the appeals process?<eos> Or how to prep for a parole hearing?<eos> You must have some real questions you want to ask me.<eos> So ask them.<eos> Did you help Nikki Moreno escape?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> No.<eos> Well, you obviously got closer than people knew.<eos> Actually, we didn't.
You know, I don't know. But we're gonna get to the bottom of it.<eos> Everett!<eos> What the hell have you done to my bees!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> ♪ Elementary 3x23 ♪ Absconded Original Air Date on May 7, 2015<eos> No, sir.<eos> Uh, understood.<eos> I will, sir.<eos> If you guys work for the USDA, why didn't you just say so?<eos> We don't.
I was gonna be there to watch you fall.<eos> Why do you keep fighting it, huh?<eos> Why put yourself through this?<eos> We both know it's just a matter of time, so why not just cut to the chase?<eos> You're gonna tell me where Alfredo is.<eos> Why?<eos> Why, 'cause he's your buddy now, huh?<eos> He's your pal?<eos> No, because he has... nothing to do with this.<eos> No, he does, Sherlock.
Can you please tell me your name?<eos> Can you tell me anything?<eos> Excuse me, Toby?<eos> Mom, I'm going to the bathroom.<eos> Ask a nurse where it is.<eos> Ow. Yeah. Right there.<eos> I'm ordering a head C.T.<eos> We don't know the extent of his head injury.<eos> She's right.<eos> You don't.
- I can't do this.<eos> I can't.<eos> - You have to. If you don't...<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> Shh, I can't do this!<eos> - You ha... you have to.<eos> If you don't, that bag of oxy's not gonna be your last.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> You're gonna survive this, okay?<eos> Everybody does.
_<eos> _ _<eos> I'm going to count silently in my head to five.<eos> Can I, um... can I use your computer?<eos> He was a terrorist.<eos> - The Department of Defense said...<eos> - He lied.<eos> They called him a terrorist in order to kill him.<eos> SOC controls the Department of Defense?<eos> Politicians do.
Sure, I can get you into SOC's mainframe, but you're not gonna find anything good there.<eos> Why not?<eos> Multinationals took all of their secure stuff off-line.<eos> Afraid of hackers.<eos> They use data centers now.<eos> Data centers?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's like warehouses, stuck in the middle of nowhere, filled with computers.<eos> And you know where SOC's data center is?<eos> For the right price, I do.
- No.<eos> Well, when I was a girl,<eos> I used to go up to Zayde's roof on Sackett Street and watch the sun go down.<eos> I'd imagine all the different countries we read about in school.<eos> All the exotic places and people.<eos> Wondering what they were doing right at that moment.<eos> And that was my dream, Bob.<eos> I wanted to see the world.<eos> Every square inch of it.<eos> But I never did.
No, no.<eos> No, my sister. Her kids.<eos> We found out too late, Mr. Frink.<eos> But you are free to go.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> - I'm free to go?<eos> I am free to go?<eos> You have suffered enough. And I am not a monster.<eos> If you ever need any more Jews to kill, you know where to find me.<eos> Yes. I do.
I mean it, too.<eos> She...<eos> Really?<eos> Don't fuck with me.<eos> I've been dreaming of this moment my entire life.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Mommy!<eos> I'm sorry I called you a cunt.<eos> Oh, don't be. It brought us together.<eos> Yeah... it did!
That your special document-signing dress?<eos> - Buddy?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> From the moment we met...<eos> I felt there was something special between us.<eos> And when I saw the way you looked at me today...<eos> So, if I could just borrow a pen...<eos> I know we haven't known each other very long, but you've already been there for me in ways that no man in my life ever has.<eos> And I find that incredibly sexy.<eos> You do?
- Mazel tov, sir. - Congratulations.<eos> - Hooray!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Now, um, who's got Dr. Edwards?<eos> I did not hook you up.<eos> All right. I have three rules.<eos> One, listen to the nurses. Respect the nurses.<eos> Do whatever the nurses say.<eos> You may think you know more than the nurses.<eos> You do not.
Yeah, but not for this you don't.<eos> Teach me.<eos> You're teaching her, so teach me.<eos> I have PhD's in bio-electrical engineering and neural systems.<eos> I mean, what more do you need?<eos> Stitching requires finesse.<eos> A feel.<eos> And you don't think I have that?<eos> No.<eos> But Camille does?
- Massive seizure, cerebral hemorrhage, death.<eos> He may have vital information.<eos> Is there a procedure for waking him up?<eos> - What are the risks?<eos> Tell me what the target is.<eos> Tell me where the attack - is going to happen.<eos> - Keep him awake, Colonel.<eos> - Stand back, please. - Sir, please.<eos> The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.<eos> They do.
It's fucked.<eos> I didn't know where else to go.<eos> You heard about the attack?<eos> Nothing happened, right?<eos> - It's over.<eos> - Yeah, they got the guys.<eos> There was a big shootout at a house in Prenzlauer Berg.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Feels like it's been forever.<eos> Yeah, it does.
I'm just free to go home?<eos> ( chuckles ) No.<eos> No.<eos> You recognized your own math.<eos> It's all...<eos> It's all a game.<eos> I tell you that I can prove the Nazis are using our science, you-- you don't even blink.<eos> Either one of you.<eos> The Germans-- Germans didn't write any of this, did they?<eos> You did.
Together.<eos> You have regrets about Lucy.<eos> I know there are things that you wish you could take back that you said and did.<eos> And so what if I do?<eos> My daughter's a forgiving soul.<eos> Too forgiving.<eos> But she knows that we're here together and she wants to mend fences.<eos> She wants a life with you.<eos> I never had a son, Paul.<eos> But you do.
"Sorry you couldn't come to her wedding"?<eos> "Sorry she wandered off into a construction site and"...<eos> Fritz.<eos> I'm sure everybody just thinks it's my fault.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> I should have walked her home, Jim.<eos> She said she was feeling off and I just let her go and...<eos> You know, no one in her family even knew what state she was in.<eos> The Army is probably just gonna tell them that she died a hero.<eos> She did.
Yes, well, you can give him a chance to atone after the war.<eos> I have family in Eastern Europe.<eos> Cousins that I never met and some that I never will, and my son has never met his grandfather, who is sitting at a pay telephone 10 miles from this office.<eos> The Jewish people don't just need Palestine, Colonel.<eos> We need each other.<eos> What about this?<eos> What if solenoid 132B was out of alignment...<eos> Um, an electrical arc occurs at, uh, section P22.<eos> Yeah, and none of the detonators fire.<eos> But they did.
Jesus.<eos> What if the charges got turned around?<eos> You did the right thing, Frank.<eos> And I know you will, too.<eos> "I hereby declare on oath that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty"...<eos> That's good enough, Paul.<eos> I hereby declare you a citizen of the United States of America.<eos> Welcome home, son.<eos> How long did it take him to figure it out?<eos> He didn't.
It doesn't matter. We should...<eos> - All sorted out?<eos> - Yeah, absolutely.<eos> I've got to head off. - All right.<eos> - Got to pick Tom up.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Does everyone have to sign in and out here?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Fire regulation. We got pulled up on it last year.<eos> - You done it? - Yep.
Yes, I think we are.<eos> 'You've met her? '<eos> 'Couple of times.<eos> She's arrogant.<eos> 'Looks down at people.'<eos> Sorry, I sound like a bitch but...<eos> Is that why he wanted someone else?<eos> What?<eos> That she's arrogant.<eos> Well, he didn't.
No.<eos> No blood, no shell casings, no nothing.<eos> Hey, doesn't this remind you of, uh, that sketch from "Saturday Night Tonight" where, uh, Mickey Franks plays Sherlock Holmes' wacky cousin?<eos> No, I don't watch that stupid show, bro.<eos> - You don't?<eos> - No. Hell, no.<eos> The sketches never have any endings.<eos> It's a big waste of time, just like searching this alley is.<eos> You know, Javi, I think that you need to find a way to be more positive.<eos> No, I don't.
So a show that brought joy, laughter, and "judge booty" to people everywhere may have been built on drug money.<eos> Yeah, but the lawsuit was thrown out, so while Sid was getting rich, van Zant was rotting in prison.<eos> You know, maybe van Zant was who Sid was talking about when he told his wife someone was after him.<eos> Makes sense, right?<eos> If van Zant felt that Sid owed him a share of the profits from the show, maybe he came to collect.<eos> And when Sid didn't want to go along, van Zant opted for revenge instead.<eos> Where is van Zant now?<eos> He's registered at a hotel up in Queens.<eos> I sent van Zant's photo to security at "S.N.T.," asked if anybody saw him last night.<eos> No one did.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Do you know where he took her?<eos> No.<eos> Ambulance is a minute out.<eos> You're gonna be all right. Tell command I want every camera in this city looking for Theo's car.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> So is it a boy or a girl?<eos> God. Do you know how broken you are?<eos> I know exactly who I am, doctor.<eos> Most people don't.
I know. I know.<eos> Pissing me off.<eos> I need my waitress.<eos> I need a Mai Tai.<eos> Yeah, go get it. Mai Tai.<eos> He needs some sex from a woman.<eos> I don't suppose one of those would be for me.<eos> I don't think you'd want it if it was.<eos> Louis likes six sugars.<eos> Of course he does.
He didn't deserve what happened to him.<eos> And what did happen?<eos> Like I told the other lawyer, he went to the hospital with chest pains.<eos> They said it was nothing.<eos> He kept complaining.<eos> Stanley never complained.<eos> Two days later, they released him.<eos> Stanley went to sleep in our bed that night.<eos> And he never woke up.<eos> (swans) No, he didn't.
Can you calm the hell down?<eos> Can anyone describe the pastor's condition Before she lost consciousness?<eos> She looked a little confused.<eos> Like, forgetting what she was going to say.<eos> Dad, you were talking with her just before.<eos> She said she had a headache so i gave her a couple aspirin.<eos> Can i see what you gave her, sir?<eos> Course, yeah.<eos> Do you have high blood pressure, sir?<eos> Yeah, i do.
No, I understand.<eos> Didn't come through here.<eos> You sure?<eos> Birthdays, anniversaries, those I forget.<eos> Equipment serviced here, never.<eos> No one from 51 dropped off a regulator, Kelly.<eos> Shut the door.<eos> I went to Air Mask and spoke to Jerry.<eos> You never took your regulator in.<eos> - Sure I did. - No. You didn't.
- I can tell when you got a stiffy for a score, brother.<eos> This is my sandbox. Stay the hell out.<eos> Sheriff.<eos> Chapel Road.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Your call cannot be completed as dialed.<eos> If you feel you've reached this number in error... Please. No!<eos> Getaway is such a silly concept, isn't it, Carlito?<eos> Nobody ever asked you to help me, Kate.<eos> Dad did.
Tracked them all down through emails, VPN sessions, chat messages, texts.<eos> One guy, and the whole thing comes down.<eos> - That's what's called...<eos> - Central point of failure.<eos> Right. Because they refused to meet in person, they compromised each other every time they sent so much as a smiley face.<eos> The rule here is, it's done here and only here.<eos> It ends when you walk out that door and begins when you walk in.<eos> Our encryption, is the real world.<eos> How do you talk to each other, then?<eos> We don't.
The secrecy of the project has to be maintained.<eos> You got any snazzy weapons?<eos> There was an attempted Zygon invasion before, in the '70s, '80s.<eos> One of our staff was a naval surgeon.<eos> Worked at Porton Down on the captured Zygons.<eos> Developed Z-67.<eos> It's a nerve gas.<eos> Unravels their DNA. Basically, turns them inside out.<eos> Where do you keep it?<eos> We don't.
Oh, God.<eos> W-Were those all people?<eos> It's an odd world nowadays, isn't it?<eos> It's always been an odd world.<eos> I mean, doesn't it feel, sometimes, that things are coming to an end?<eos> Everything's just going nuts.<eos> You're middle-aged, that's what it is.<eos> No offence.<eos> Everybody middle-aged always thinks the world's about to come to an end.<eos> Never does.
You're not completely free to come and go as you please.<eos> Well, this is Abuddin.<eos> No one assumes that.<eos> This is not how I remember you.<eos> It's nice of you to notice.<eos> No.<eos> It's not how I was.<eos> My father's dead now, so I've had to... you know.<eos> Can you tell my uncle that I'm here, please, Aunt Leila?<eos> I already did.
Sir, all of our resources have to be devoted to Korsten.<eos> He's got hours on us. I've heard nothing conclusive.<eos> What about Mason and Korsten's motive?<eos> I'll find out.<eos> Well, when that time comes, we'll know whether<eos> - to drop our other two suspects.<eos> - With all due respect, sir, there are no other suspects.<eos> - Korsten has the polonium.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
OK, get your hands up in the air where we can see them.<eos> I suggest you leave now if you want to live.<eos> You got visual?<eos> Take the shot.<eos> Johnny?<eos> It's OK.<eos> We just want to talk to you.<eos> Seems I have their attention.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
It's not gonna happen here.<eos> I'll go to my death, clinging, to the happy thought of their suffering.<eos> 328 people in this building.<eos> How many of them are responsible for what happened to you?<eos> You'll be killing hundreds of innocent people.<eos> Secretaries, accountants, the cleaning staff.<eos> The good people.<eos> Just like your friends.<eos> They don't deserve this.<eos> Just like you didn't.
I'm on my way to see her now.<eos> Good work.<eos> Thank you, Arabela.<eos> What have you found?<eos> Huh? What have you found?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> - You read Polish, Berger?<eos> - I, uh... just wanted to make sure you heard about the body they found in the woods, Alonso Caro.<eos> I did.
Cameron: A girl is missing.<eos> You can't throw a party where her kidnapper lived.<eos> - Because?<eos> - Because it's wrong on every level.<eos> I think there's a gray area where it's a wee bit right.<eos> Does anything you see out here, match what you saw in the stitch?<eos> No.<eos> Um, there's someone in the house.<eos> I didn't see anything.<eos> I did.
I didn't sleep well last night.<eos> - You snore.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> Are you guys... ?<eos> You know what?<eos> T.M.I.<eos> - We're not.<eos> - Let's just do this.<eos> - Look familiar?<eos> - Yeah, this kind of does.
Zed's rotator cuff was all jammed up, and then, there was Linus' driving.<eos> Zed?<eos> We'll explain later.<eos> And there's nothing wrong with my driving.<eos> Yeah, anyway, while Linus was busy driving like my grandmother, I ran the photogrammetry on the picture.<eos> - Kelli is in...<eos> - a small room with cement walls.<eos> - Yes, but did you notice...<eos> - the walls are covered with plastic.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Yesterday<eos> I biked up Buck Mountain, sailed back down in a hang glider.<eos> I had my breakfast, made love to my companion, sent her on her way.<eos> Then I took my Asian investors ballooning in wine country, I secured a deal which opened up Vietnam and Laos, then I jetted back home where I accepted a Chamber of Commerce innovator award.<eos> Gee, I guess I must've missed the Journal headline.<eos> Why don't you email it to me?<eos> No one on the board doubts your commitment to being the face of the company.<eos> Since the article detailing how Max Rager consumers have experienced manic, violent episodes, sales have dropped 30%.<eos> And, of course, there are the lawsuits.<eos> Last year, we did sales of...
HE LAUGHS Exactly.<eos> Right, what does she know?<eos> What do any of them know?<eos> I identified the car as that seen on the night of Stevie's...<eos> Would you like to amend that sentence, Inspector?<eos> I identified the car as that POSSIBLY seen on the night of Stev...<eos> Of Detective Sergeant<eos> Jackie Stevenson's murder... and I pursued the vehicle.<eos> Why didn't you call for backup?<eos> We did.
You passed.<eos> "Traumatic grief within normal range."<eos> "No other psychiatric disorder indicated."<eos> "Recommendation - six sessions" "to be increased to 12" "at the discretion of the psychiatrist in charge."<eos> A copy will be forwarded to all the relevant parties.<eos> You dodged a bullet.<eos> I don't know how but... worth dinner and flowers at least.<eos> You're right.<eos> Jimmy has an alibi.<eos> He always did.
What?<eos> Where?<eos> Dad!<eos> Hey, hey, hey. I'm okay.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> No sign of Katherine Beckett, sir.<eos> E.S.U. says the building is secure.<eos> There's no sign of Beckett.<eos> Why doesn't Beckett trust me?<eos> She does.
Yeah, briefly at Widzew Lódz.<eos> You should have seen this guy.<eos> He was... he was the fastest ever.<eos> At Juventus, they used to call him Bello di notte.<eos> And today, one hundred million, just for his bad foot.<eos> How come you're no longer manager of Legia?<eos> How come...<eos> I left because of a... let's just say because of a difference of opinion.<eos> And was this difference of opinion with Victor Arshad?<eos> To do with your connection, to the right-wing followers of the club?
- Nope.<eos> Most of the fines were paid by a Dutch citizen by the name of Joep Mees.<eos> And guess where he was two hours before the bomb went off?<eos> - The executive area at Lubin stadium.<eos> - Any motive for Mees?<eos> No causes, no activism,<eos> - he's low level.<eos> - Anything to connect him with Arshad?<eos> - Arshad's a ghost. We got nothing on him.<eos> - Yes, we do.
You are the only one of us with the expertise to manage those encrypted lines.<eos> I can talk Luke through it.<eos> - Seriously, it's not that hard.<eos> - No.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> You know me.<eos> I am a gambling man too, Berger.<eos> I am betting on you.<eos> - I believe you can.<eos> - No, you don't.
I'm on the 7-30 train from Copenhagen and...<eos> I don't when it's gonna arrive, but I'm gonna go straight to your office, and... I have something that...<eos> Well, I'm very eager to see you.<eos> OK. Bye.<eos> Miss Jensen did not make it, she was found dead, in a locked lavatory on the train from Copenhagen.<eos> Cause of death?<eos> - As yet unknown.<eos> - The Hague police are investigating.<eos> But given her message, you would figure the worst.<eos> I do.
What's up?<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> Take a look at this section of vertebra.<eos> Okay, looks like a bunch of osteoblasts.<eos> The density's low, which indicates a progressed form of osteoporosis.<eos> That tells us the victim was an alcoholic.<eos> Yeah, it also tells us that Dr. Brennan was right-- it wasn't Booth.<eos> Good catch.<eos> I didn't find it.<eos> Dr. Brennan did.
Uh, you sure?<eos> Yeah. We'll be fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, text me if you need anything. All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye, Grandma.<eos> Yes, darling.<eos> I love you.<eos> Bye.<eos> What the hell does Rachel do for a living?
-Lovely to meet you.<eos> -Nice to meet you.<eos> Take care.<eos> Wow. I mean, I think his heart's in the right place, but he really shouldn't be saying "ethnic" that much. Mm-mm.<eos> What is the real race breakdown of your previous dudes?<eos> Uh, white, white, white, white, half-Asian, then you.<eos> Whoa, so that half-Asian guy, he was kind of a gateway drug to me?<eos> I guess so.<eos> Who knows what will be next?<eos> I do.
We need to talk.<eos> ls there a place we can talk?<eos> Come with me<eos> It's this way<eos> We will need a list of all passengers and crew<eos> Yes<eos> But we can't wait for long<eos> Well, Captain, I'm afraid you'll have to stay as long as you have to stay.<eos> I don't have the authority to make a decision like that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
Bye-bye, boys.<eos> Holy smoke, they got Dad and Race.<eos> But why did the security system not alert us?<eos> I understand why evil people would take the Q-sphere. But why take Dr. Quest?<eos> Because Dad is the only man on the planet who knows how to work it.<eos> With Race out of the picture, who will save Dr. Quest?<eos> We can save 'em, if we only knew where they went.<eos> Perhaps those robot creatures left some sort of energy trail.<eos> Ah, I doubt it.<eos> But the Q-sphere does.
If you'll agree to bring him in, I can guarantee a first crack at him, which would be the safest way to do this.<eos> If you're saying you won't, the marshal's Fugitive Task Force team will.<eos> And I can't guarantee the outcome.<eos> Granger.<eos> We'll do it.<eos> We'll bring in Callen.<eos> Good.<eos> I have to tell you-- this feels wrong.<eos> I mean, why doesn't Hetty just trust Callen knows what he's doing?<eos> She does...
Eric...<eos> Eric, put the gun down.<eos> Why'd you have to go looking, man?<eos> Why couldn't you just leave it alone?<eos> ! - I was bluffing.<eos> - Open the door, Eric!<eos> All right?<eos> I didn't find anything.<eos> I looked.<eos> I did.
The biggest.<eos> The contract.<eos> The Examiner says we're auctioning The Swift Collection.<eos> Apparently Roxanna signed Avery Swift while I was sedated.<eos> Avery Swift is dead.<eos> He signed first.<eos> The news got out pretty fast.<eos> Did you commence the publicity campaign before or after he signed?<eos> - I didn't tell them.<eos> - Then who did?
I did this, do you hear me?<eos> I did this.<eos> This was my fault.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - Liar.<eos> You always care.<eos> Always have.<eos> Your reign of terror will end<eos> - with the sight of the first crying child and you know it.<eos> I do.
All right, let's get the job done.<eos> Jesus...<eos> FBI!<eos> No...<eos> Where's your husband?<eos> Betty, where's Phil?<eos> I don't know!<eos> He left with...<eos> With the hit man he hired. We know everything.<eos> No, you don't.
He's back!<eos> Ah, who's "he"?<eos> Lem.<eos> Lem Lem?<eos> He got back to the camp, about an hour ago.<eos> At first I thought he was drinking again, but then he started, tearing people apart.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> His eyes were all white and crazy.<eos> Looked like a fuckin' monster.<eos> Oh, of course he did.
It's hard to see through the trees and the fog, but up there's the Big Dipper.<eos> Heproposedto me by thelight of the North Star.<eos> That's real romantic.<eos> So are you two together, or... ?<eos> Who, me and Pablo?<eos> No.<eos> Haven't seen a guy since we started this dumb hike.<eos> Might be nice to have someone to keep me warm for a night or two.<eos> He's got a girlfriend, though.<eos> Oh, of course he does.
Son of a bitch!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Two Ashes?<eos> Easy kids.<eos> No need to jump the gun here.<eos> Yeah, yeah, don't shoot the wrong guy, dummies.<eos> Oh, you buyin' this shiny turd?<eos> This is the guy who killed Fisher.<eos> Come on, take him out!<eos> I did not!
Sir, there's absolutely no evidence of a security breach of any kind.<eos> And yet we know there was a security breach?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> So what you're telling me, Captain Connolly, is that you've failed.<eos> Sir...<eos> You're not allowed to fail, Captain.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Not when it involves a coordinated attack on the high command.<eos> The Semite I brought in, the one who shot at me, did you manage to locate any members of his family?<eos> Yes. Yes, we did.
Master Gawain.<eos> Sorry, my lady, I'm afraid my "troubled thoughts" wander a bit far today.<eos> I understand.<eos> My thoughts are beyond wandering.<eos> They've taken to a full gallop.<eos> Yet you seem of better spirit.<eos> I am.<eos> When you see your healer again, will you share my gratitude for her kindness?<eos> Her remedy served you, then?<eos> Yes, it did.
Are they transcribed?<eos> No.<eos> There are hundreds of pages.<eos> And yet you have time for idle conversation.<eos> You are the punisher.<eos> Yea.<eos> Gawain Maddox.<eos> I'm afraid I don't know your name.<eos> This is true.<eos> You do not.
Hey... when you find them... don't trust anyone.<eos> How are you, Ryan?<eos> Oh, I'm all right.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> Agent Booth.<eos> Glad to see you're still with us.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Do you have any idea who shot you?<eos> Did you see their face?<eos> Yes, I did.
♪ I'm in the sky ♪<eos> ♪ Thoughts are like pearls ♪<eos> ♪ And flags are unfurled ♪<eos> ♪ Because you're mine, mine, mine ♪<eos> ♪ Because you're mine ♪<eos> Why are your clothes still on?<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> You know, if you want to be a good FBI agent, you're gonna have to learn how to lie better.<eos> You didn't have a date tonight with Brandon... o-or anybody, I figure.<eos> No, I didn't.
And that wasn't fair. And I was always on your side.<eos> You know that.<eos> You deserved better.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe Agent Asher could have helped you, but Simon Asher only works for a startup.<eos> A tech startup... With equipment you can use to analyze this.<eos> Whoever framed me staged my apartment to look like I built a bomb, but they left that behind.<eos> I'll never forget how you handled that bomb at Quantico.<eos> Ultimately, it didn't matter, did it?<eos> Everybody got to see the real me... and didn't really like what they saw, did they?<eos> I did.
It's not a lie when you don't tell somebody who you're talking to on the phone.<eos> That's normal.<eos> Not when you hide in the bathroom to do it. You don't have a boyfriend.<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> - Oh, you want to talk about hiding?<eos> What's the file in your... none of your business.<eos> Get your hands off me.<eos> Look, it's okay.<eos> We both said things we didn't mean.<eos> Yeah, and some things we kind of did.
Why do you give us those cases?<eos> They can't be solved.<eos> To remind you that you can gather the smartest, bravest, most committed people, give them the best advantages of technology and information, and they will still lose, still get outwitted.<eos> Then why keep them open?<eos> Why not just admit that you couldn't solve them?<eos> When the FBI loses, it's different than a loss for other people.<eos> It means more when the stakes are so high, so we don't like to call it a loss.<eos> We just don't want to look at it that way.<eos> You don't think it's wrong to not admit defeat, not accept your weaknesses?<eos> Oh, yeah. I do.
Hours before their planned suicide bomb attack on the state supreme court during the opening remarks in the Sistemics' trial.<eos> The raid was led by a Special Agent Clayton Haas."<eos> Look, I told you... they brainwashed me. All right?<eos> They made me believe that the government was taking away our liberties.<eos> But I... I was 17!<eos> I was just a kid!<eos> And what?<eos> You thought if you blew yourself up in the middle of the courthouse, you would show people the truth?<eos> For so long, I've been trying to realize why I've never told you that I love you.<eos> Because I do.
I need that mask back.<eos> Right now.<eos> You should bounce while you can, Tommy.<eos> Look, if I don't get that mask back, people a lot more dangerous than me are going to come for it.<eos> Who's coming?<eos> Your badass art buddies going to come rough us up?<eos> Don't underestimate people with money.<eos> 'Cause they hire guys to do what they can't.<eos> I don't got it no more.<eos> Well, who does?
"Impossible." Good.<eos> Stay with that.<eos> I need you to wrap your head around impossible, Alex.<eos> People will die if you do not belive in the impossible in the next...<eos> Eight minutes and six seconds.<eos> Well, this is highly irregular.<eos> But within the rules.<eos> Mr. Kane, my name is Mr. Johnson.<eos> The next thing I'm about to say to you you're not going to believe.<eos> Most people don't.
Even if she is, Rio isn't.<eos> He's played this thing pretty well so far.<eos> There's no way he would let her know where he is.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's riding around L.A. in a convertible like a tourist.<eos> Is he?<eos> Or is he meeting contacts at places where it's just very easy to blend in?<eos> Might've planned this whole thing out.<eos> I doubt he planned on getting arrested in Singapore.<eos> Nobody does.
But sometimes...<eos> Don't let me down, okay?<eos> When a bug finally makes itself known, it can be exhilarating, like you just unlocked something.<eos> A grand opportunity waiting to be taken advantage of.<eos> Mr. Wellick?<eos> Hey.<eos> What was your name again?<eos> Anwar.<eos> I didn't know you came to places like this.<eos> I don't.
Nope.<eos> He wasn't home.<eos> Well, I'm here.<eos> I want to talk to you about everything, just not tonight, okay?<eos> So you talked to him, but not with you boyfriend?<eos> It's different, Ollie.<eos> Both of our parents died because...<eos> That's how we know each other.<eos> I really don't want to talk about this right now.<eos> What if I do?
Yeah, maybe they'd cry for a day, but let's be honest. No one would give a shit.<eos> They wouldn't.<eos> The few people that would feel obligated to go to your funeral would probably be annoyed and leave as early as possible.<eos> That's who you are.<eos> That's what you are.<eos> You're nothing to anyone, to everyone.<eos> Think about it, Bill.<eos> 'Cause if you do, if you let yourself... You'll know I'm telling you the truth.<eos> So instead of wasting any more of my time, I need you to go call someone that matters, because, Bill...<eos> You don't.
Am I his malware?<eos> I had to wash my face.<eos> Hard to breathe... here.<eos> I know you framed Terry Colby.<eos> I-I didn't. Your father worked at Evil Corp before he died.<eos> That's a matter of public record.<eos> I'm not turning you in, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> I don't even have proof, and even if I did, I don't care.<eos> Just wanted to know your weakness.<eos> Now I do.
I don't know where he is.<eos> I mean, he always comes to me.<eos> If all you did was track down the victims, - how did he know their names?<eos> - Divine inspiration.<eos> You guys don't get it.<eos> You should be helping him, not hunting him.<eos> Help him kill people...<eos> 'cause, sure, that makes sense.<eos> Do you think he likes doing what he's doing?<eos> He doesn't.
Hello, little punisher.<eos> Hello.<eos> From the baroness.<eos> A letter from her to you?<eos> Why?<eos> The court is in need of service.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He said thank you, maiden.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he did.
Father Ruskin and Master Gawain's son Luca have been missing for two days now.<eos> The boy was in the priest's charge.<eos> Our priest made no mention of a pilgrimage?<eos> His belongings and steed are all still here.<eos> I will gather our resources at once, my lady.<eos> Scouts, trackers.<eos> We will leave with the sunrise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Does Maddox know about the boy?<eos> He does not.
It's not your watch for another hour.<eos> Couldn't sleep.<eos> I'm sure she's fine, Jackson.<eos> I'm sure she's fine, too.<eos> And when we return home with the cure, we'll set everything straight.<eos> We'll be heroes.<eos> I never cared to be a hero.<eos> I just wanted a... quiet, simple life.<eos> Which is what we had.<eos> Yes, we did.
That's the only girl I can think of.<eos> The one the Marshal was after?<eos> Honestly, she was no one.<eos> No one?<eos> This Marshal, Mr Kahler, what did he say in his report?<eos> That Mr Blake defended the girl, told him to leave her alone because he was using her.<eos> That's correct.<eos> I thought she was the courier you had told me about, sir.<eos> And did Major Klemm tell you how important it is not to leave anything out of this account, Joe?<eos> Yes, sir, he did.
All right, relax, relax.<eos> Anissa did a couple of tours in Afghanistan, took some mortar fire.<eos> Unfortunately, doctors couldn't save her sense of humor.<eos> Jackson? - You were saying?<eos> - I was thinking that maybe we try more of a stealthy approach.<eos> One where we get in and out without security even knowing we're there.<eos> - And how do you propose that?<eos> - We have a secret weapon.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> - We do.
They knew about the security cameras from the video.<eos> More likely, they pounced at your home.<eos> You gained the upper hand, as you are wont to do.<eos> Suddenly, you had two bodies to get rid of.<eos> But your victims brought their own shovels, tarps and lye.<eos> You could have buried them right there in your yard.<eos> Tell us, Mr. Murillo, when the New Jersey police search your home, will they find two graves?<eos> Say they do.<eos> It was self-defense, you said it yourself.<eos> I did, I did.
You're not buying that?<eos> One of my men cut it off.<eos> Saved my life.<eos> By chopping off your hand?<eos> You kind of had to be there.<eos> - Does it hurt?<eos> Phantom pain.<eos> The thing that's missing is the thing that you feel the most.<eos> - Makes it hard to forget.<eos> - So maybe you don't.
I just never thought it'd be you.<eos> I never knew why you married me.<eos> I was never as... kind and empathetic as you.<eos> That's why it was so easy for me to walk away why I gave up on you.<eos> I lost something when I left you.<eos> I won't do it again.<eos> But you have to stop this.<eos> Melinda...<eos> How'd you know that wouldn't kill him?<eos> I didn't.
What do you think we should do about it?<eos> For now... let's just watch the sunrise.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I never thought I deserved this.<eos> - What, a trip to Hawaii?<eos> - No.<eos> Happiness.<eos> This kind of happiness.<eos> Of course you do.
Mr. Dennis turned it around and had me use it to figure out who to fire.<eos> So this wasn't your idea?<eos> I was trying to get people to get paid more, not paid nothing.<eos> Hi, I'm Carla Groves.<eos> My supervisor asked me to come see you.<eos> Hi.<eos> Yes. Um...<eos> I don't know quite how to say this--<eos> I'm fired.<eos> But clearly you do.
Otherwise we're wasting our time.<eos> I didn't think you'd come.<eos> I made a commitment to be here every week.<eos> You know, I never trust cops as a kid, and you just reminded me why.<eos> We want to find out who killed Karim. So do I!<eos> - And the only were we can do that...<eos> - You seriously think that it was me?<eos> Who do you think I am?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Nobody does!
You had no suspicion?<eos> Of what?<eos> The high-ranking Nazi insinuated his way into the center of our Crown Prince's visit, a visit during which His Highness was shot.<eos> He was on the same podium.<eos> I did not come with accusations, Minister.<eos> At this stage, only suspicion.<eos> Do you have any idea how or why Colonel Wegener fled from his hotel?<eos> I'm sure that there's an innocent explanation.<eos> Yesterday you issued a diplomatic visa.<eos> Yes, I did.
Listen, I think Sakura is a room somewhere in this building, and I need to find it.<eos> I don't know what it is you're doing.<eos> I need a floor plan, Christine.<eos> Or why you think you can come to me, but I need this job.<eos> I promise this will never get back to you.<eos> But the next time that bastard demands personal services, at least you'll know you screwed him a little, too.<eos> I... I, uh... I didn't know where else to go.<eos> I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here.<eos> But you did.<eos> You did, Frank.
A symbol of their failure.<eos> Your world will now make great leaps forward in progress.<eos> Crime will not be tolerated.<eos> War will not be tolerated.<eos> All will obey or be destroyed.<eos> The whole world saw that message.<eos> The mighty Thor bound and captive.<eos> The humans will now fall into line.<eos> I can't believe we pulled it off.<eos> Of course we did.
- Then I must be getting great, 'cause I'm way out of my comfort zone.<eos> These energy readings are coming straight from the planet's core.<eos> Whoever's doing this is making Galactus look like an amateur.<eos> Thanos.<eos> These creatures make Frost Giants looks handsome.<eos> Falcon!<eos> Off me, beasts!<eos> This alien atmosphere must be playing tricks on my hearing.<eos> - Sounded like Falcon said "Thanos."<eos> - I did.
Hey, hey, hey. Don't. Don't What you doing?<eos> I mean it.<eos> Don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> What good is this gonna do?<eos> Good?<eos> What's it matter?<eos> What's the point? Come on, man.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> I do.
What?<eos> I'm being accused of making unauthorized trades.<eos> By Morello?<eos> I don't work there anymore.<eos> I work at Butler Trading.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Were they authorized or not?<eos> I swear to God I didn't do one thing they don't know about.<eos> And let me guess, you don't have any proof?<eos> No, I don't.
Because that's the way things work.<eos> Uh, what does that mean?<eos> It means he's saying they checked his trades enough to decide it was okay with the risk, but not enough to put it in writing.<eos> Okay, but why wouldn't they put it in writing?<eos> Because they would rather say I went rogue than pay a two million dollar fine.<eos> HARVEY: Here's the problem, Sam.<eos> Why should I believe you, when the last time we met you were the one who was willing to put an innocent person away?<eos> Because I didn't know she was innocent.<eos> And the truth is I didn't care.<eos> But you did.
She's not gonna want to help us.<eos> It's not about helping us. It's about helping her client.<eos> I can't ask her to do that. Why not?<eos> Because I can't.<eos> Harvey, what's going on?<eos> Nothing's going on.<eos> How did you know those things about her in that deposition?<eos> Because I did.<eos> Does it have something to do with the fact that you've been having panic attacks and that she's your therapist?<eos> Because if it does...
Some of them must have admitted the way it works at Butler, and it's in your notes.<eos> Let me see if I have my facts straight.<eos> You eviscerate me, justify it, and then waltz back here as if nothing happened.<eos> I know something happened, but now is not the time.<eos> You mean now is not the time as long as you need a favor.<eos> Oh, God damn it, you're not doing me a favor.<eos> You're helping your patient, the one you said you went to see three different lawyers to keep from betraying.<eos> And if you hadn't betrayed me, you wouldn't be in this position right now.<eos> What do you want me to say'? I'm sorry?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
I'm saying you weren't ready to move on.<eos> You're all right, Gretchen.<eos> Hope you like French.<eos> Harvey.<eos> You know, you didn't have to schedule an appointment just to tell me how it turned out.<eos> I scheduled an appointment to give you these.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> They're from Sam Tull.<eos> Did you get me anything?<eos> I did.
Check the generator.<eos> Can you give us an update what's up with generators?<eos> - Can you run?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Ward works for the same group that sent you here.<eos> They've been sending people over for centuries.<eos> - Sacrifices.<eos> - Their real agenda is to find the creature and bring it back.<eos> Ward found a way to bring it back?<eos> No. I did.
After the Maha Shivaratri/Oshogatsu/Christmas party some of the crew reprogrammed me.<eos> - They did, did they?<eos> - Yes. In order to enter rooms, everyone must do the song.<eos> It's very amusing.<eos> But you know who I am!<eos> You just called me by my name!<eos> Nevertheless.<eos> What song?<eos> You know the one.<eos> I don't!
- Yes. In order to enter rooms, everyone must do the song.<eos> It's very amusing.<eos> But you know who I am!<eos> You just called me by my name!<eos> Nevertheless.<eos> What song?<eos> You know the one.<eos> I don't!<eos> Now you're just being silly.<eos> Of course you do.
They're under my command.<eos> I owe it to them.<eos> To die? They wouldn't thank you for that.<eos> Nor you, Clara. "To die, to die.<eos> "Glamis hath murdered sleep, "therefore Cawdor shall sleep no more.<eos> "Macbeth shall sleep no more."<eos> What?<eos> Shakespeare.<eos> He really knew his stuff.<eos> They all did. The ancients. The poets.
That does not end.<eos> That never ends.<eos> It just rips a hole inside of you that never closes.<eos> Your child is dead!<eos> You can visit his grave, bring him flowers.<eos> You know exactly where he is and what he is.<eos> My child is breathing and talking right down the block from me at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but I can't see him.<eos> I don't know how he is or what he needs or if he's even okay.<eos> He's surrounded by vultures who want to pick the flesh from his bones, but he doesn't know it.<eos> And I do.
I got a daughter to take care of.<eos> You know that jobs don't come easy for ex-cons, right?<eos> Look, man, I got a master's in electrical engineering, all right?<eos> I'm gonna be fine.<eos> Welcome to Baskin-Robbins.<eos> Would you like to try our Mango Fruit Blast?<eos> Uh, no, thanks.<eos> Um, I will have...<eos> I'll have a burger, please.<eos> Oh, we don't...
The board's chairman is my daughter, Hope.<eos> She was the deciding vote.<eos> But she came back to me when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula.<eos> The process is highly volatile.<eos> If one isn't protected by a specialized helmet, it can affect the brain's chemistry.<eos> I don't think Darren realizes this, and, you know, he's not the most stable guy to begin with.<eos> So, what do you want from me?<eos> Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption.<eos> Do you?<eos> I do.
What did you see?<eos> I saw myself.<eos> Then why did you push me away?<eos> Because I saw too much of myself.<eos> He knows.<eos> He's baiting you.<eos> We have to call it off.<eos> We're all taking risks.<eos> What if he saw me here?<eos> He didn't.
All you can do is make sure that it's in the right hands.<eos> This is an advanced prototype that your mother and I worked on together.<eos> She never got to use it.<eos> But now I realize that we were... We were working on it for you.<eos> Maybe it's time we finished it.<eos> It's about damn time.<eos> Hey, Cap!<eos> This would have been a lot easier a week ago.<eos> - If we call Tony... - He won't believe us.<eos> Even if he did...
It's got to be better than this, than giving up.<eos> Could you do that?<eos> Could you free the general?<eos> I could speak to Mahmoud.<eos> I... think I might be able to convince him, for his own sake.<eos> Except...<eos> Except we'd have a general with no army.<eos> Jamal controls the treasury.<eos> I have no way to pay Solomon's soldiers.<eos> I do.
Bassam left this for Sammy and Molly.<eos> Before the battle.<eos> BARRY: Once I joined the resistance, I knew that I couldn't be Khalil forever.<eos> That... sooner or later, I'd have to reveal that Bassam Al Fayeed was still alive.<eos> LEILA: You spared him, Jamal.<eos> You have nothing to feel guilty for.<eos> But the guilt that you hadn't made you paranoid.<eos> It blinded you and turned you against your own family.<eos> Rami didn't kill your mother.<eos> The Caliphate did.
These are powerful ingredients, Arthur.<eos> I hope you know what you're doing.<eos> We need something to protect us. These people drop from the sky, then they turn on us, freeing prisoners!<eos> They won't stop until they've taken everything from me.<eos> Guards!<eos> Infidels are on their way.<eos> Call up the reserves. Get every man on the parapet, and patrol every hall.<eos> And, you, give me your helm.<eos> The ladle and the caldron have special protection spells.<eos> This helmet and our friends do not.
That voice in my head was right.<eos> I don't want to give up the darkness. - Not yet.<eos> - What?<eos> I need to use it one last time.<eos> I brought the dagger and the flame, but you don't get it until you free my family.<eos> No.<eos> You will hand it over now, or I unleash Merlin.<eos> Emma, please.<eos> I don't want to fight you.<eos> No, but I do.
I'm no one's toy.<eos> We need to find a way to get rid of these iron shackles before Emma gets back.<eos> Those shackles aren't the problem. This one is.<eos> When Regina put it back on, she enchanted my wrist, and I can't cut it off.<eos> Without magic, we're never gonna get out of here alive.<eos> It's a good thing I happen to have some then.<eos> What?<eos> You've got magic?<eos> No.<eos> My hook does.
You knew Fergus, too, but you're acting like you... like you never even met the man.<eos> - Have you already forgotten our deal?<eos> - No, I remember.<eos> But what kind of friend would I be if it stuck to it?<eos> Why have you closed off your heart like this?<eos> There's one lesson I didn't teach you the last time we were here.<eos> A true warrior doesn't let anything hurt them.<eos> Not bad.<eos> Next lesson, you never leave your flank open.<eos> I didn't.
I'm glad you agree.<eos> I'll let you know when the paperwork's finished.<eos> I know you didn't wrap your head around this deal in the last ten minutes, so what are you still doing in my office?<eos> Exactly what you'd be doing in my place.<eos> Robert, I know you said that you know these two lawyers, but I don't.<eos> I need to see for myself what they will or won't do.<eos> And you still want to counter.<eos> I want to at least try.<eos> Except you don't want to go by yourself, you want me to go with you.<eos> Yes, I do.
So either let these terms stand, or do what you always do and screw everything up.<eos> Robert, I'm glad you're here-- What the hell did you do?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I went to see Emma Powell, but I swear to God, I did not undermine the settlement.<eos> I'm not talking about that.<eos> I'm talking about you going behind my back to Arcadian. - I didn't do that.<eos> - Oh, you expect me to believe that after all the shit you told me the last time I saw you?<eos> You can believe it or not, but I'm telling you I didn't do anything.<eos> Then who did?<eos> - I did.
Why?<eos> Is this the type of guy you are? One setback and you fold?<eos> Well, then maybe you're not the guy for us anyway.<eos> Well, maybe I'm not.<eos> Jack...<eos> Maybe this just wasn't meant to be.<eos> Cait, come on, I mean,<eos> Jax could be our last chance at saving Professor Stein.<eos> He said no to being a superhero.<eos> Who does that?
You said I went soft.<eos> What do we got without our reputation?<eos> Now, if this is a fake, I'm gonna come back to visit.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> He said he knew my dad?<eos> Yeah, they used to run in the same circle.<eos> - What was that thing you gave him?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> The hell it doesn't.
10K!<eos> 10K!<eos> Kid!<eos> Can you hear us? !<eos> Send a smoke signal!<eos> I'm going across. Doc.<eos> You won't make it.<eos> We have to get him.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
- Hey, Abby.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should have told you about Dad.<eos> And me blaming my issues with him on you... that wasn't fair.<eos> It's okay.<eos> But I also know that no matter what... we're gonna be fine.<eos> No fight is ever gonna keep us apart again.<eos> So, what do you want to do?<eos> You want to talk to him?<eos> I do.
A few weeks ago.<eos> We didn't even know it was on the island.<eos> And then suddenly it was everywhere.<eos> First is just went after wild dragons, then it started coming after us.<eos> And how many dragons has it killed?<eos> None yet.<eos> This dragon is more than strong. It's fast, it's smart and it's elusive.<eos> We've never even gotten a good look at it.<eos> This does seem like quite the challenge, doesn't it?<eos> Yes, it does.
What?<eos> Look. I know how traders talk. I know exactly what they'd say.<eos> So, I just wrote them myself.<eos> Are you shitting me?<eos> Take a look.<eos> I lied to you because to get them to believe they were illegal, I had to get them to believe they were real. (CHUCKLES)<eos> And you needed me to be pissed to help you do that.<eos> Told you to trust me.<eos> You know what?<eos> I do.
And you're gonna figure out a way to turn it down.<eos> What?<eos> Go ahead, take a minute.<eos> Congratulations, you've earned it.<eos> You are the best associate I have ever seen.<eos> Now, these are your options.<eos> Medical issues, family emergency, you're just not ready.<eos> Whatever it is, you simply cannot accept a junior partnership at this time.<eos> Jessica, no one turns down partner.<eos> Well, they do now.
Master Hiccup,<eos> I realize that you are the dragon expert among us...<eos> I wouldn't say the dragon expert, I'd say...<eos> - Shh!<eos> - As I was saying, it appears to me that this island is occupied by a rather unfriendly pack of wild dragons.<eos> You're right, Johann.<eos> But it's worse than that. Oh, ho-ho, you're full of good news, aren't you?<eos> Gimme that.<eos> So, this means we get to go rescue him, I suppose.<eos> It does.
Uh, well, look, uh, from now on, Let's just be honest with each other, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. I don't know what you see in your girlfriend, And you're getting a little tummy.<eos> What?<eos> I...<eos> Oh!<eos> I mean, uh [clears throat] i-if i --<eos> If i stand up straight, it, uh, goes away, doesn't it?<eos> Uh...<eos> Oh, no. It doesn't.
I don't get to choose sides.<eos> Whoever comes for you comes for me.<eos> That's all I need to know.<eos> She's awake.<eos> Yes. Whoever comes for me may very well come for you...<eos> But they may also come through you, Marcellus.<eos> Remember that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I hoped I was wrong, Lucien...<eos> I really did...
Ugh, it's -- never mind.<eos> I love you.<eos> i i<eos> Ugh agh.<eos> Rick!<eos> Pants!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Thanks, kids.<eos> You figured it out.<eos> Well, summer did.
Let me disappear.<eos> You would spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder, never knowing when Zoom is coming. Okay.<eos> And what's your great idea?<eos> How were you supposed to contact him after you killed me?<eos> I was supposed to get something... something I could only get if you were dead... and then throw it through the breach as proof. - And then what?<eos> - Then he'd come for me.<eos> Confirm the kill and bring me home.<eos> - Why do you want to know?<eos> - Because I want to find him.<eos> You really don't.
I'm keeping my options open.<eos> I don't understand why you think we have a choice.<eos> Zoom wants me dead.<eos> The meta-humans that he's sending from Earth-2, they don't care how many innocent people get in the way.<eos> Look at what happened to Iris and Linda's boss.<eos> He was just collateral damage in Zoom's war.<eos> The next time, that could be you or Iris.<eos> I'm just wondering if going after him now is premature.<eos> I mean, we barely know anything about his abilities.<eos> Wells does.
I didn't even dream last night.<eos> I was... really hoping I would, you know?<eos> I thought maybe it would...<eos> I just...<eos> Someone did this to me.<eos> Took away my whole life.<eos> And I can't do anything.<eos> I got you a coffee and a tea this morning.<eos> Which would you prefer?<eos> - I don't...
But, as I've grown older, I've come to realize nothing is more important than family.<eos> No.<eos> I've rented a cottage in East Hampton.<eos> Our families must meet.<eos> Your children... sprechen sie schon Deutsch?<eos> Better than me, certainly. Ah.<eos> I seem to recall.<eos> Still, it hasn't inhibited your advancement, has it?<eos> The Führer places great faith in you, John, to collect these films of his.<eos> Yes, he does.
Hey, wait a second.<eos> When am I going to see you again?<eos> You won't.<eos> There are things I want to say to you.<eos> I can't do this, Joe.<eos> Juliana.<eos> Frank's a lucky guy.<eos> What's that cop doing out there?<eos> Uh, I don't know.<eos> Nothing to do with me.
It's time for your big adventure.<eos> I was just starting to worry.<eos> We stopped for ice cream.<eos> And then for a doughnut.<eos> Yay!<eos> Lenya!<eos> Well, she seems fine.<eos> She is, I'm the one that's a basket case.<eos> Did you talk to my sister?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I think... I think you solved this thing so it's time to go back on your meds, okay?<eos> - I'm not a moron.<eos> - Nobody said you were.<eos> You don't think I know what you're doing?<eos> No, no!<eos> No!<eos> I know exactly what you're doing.<eos> I just want you to take your pills like we agreed.<eos> - "Like we agreed."<eos> - Yeah, we did.
We have a green light?<eos> We have a green light.<eos> However, I did neglect to mention your conversation with Etai Luskin.<eos> I'm sure you did.<eos> How detailed is their intelligence, do you think?<eos> They know Assad's in the crosshairs.<eos> They know we have a likely candidate to replace him.<eos> Screw 'em.<eos> As long as they don't know the who and the when.<eos> They don't.
You look like one of the Baader-Meinhof gang.<eos> Do you mind if we talk in the car?<eos> A little paranoid, are we? Please.<eos> I've, I've got no one else to turn to.<eos> What about your former employer?<eos> They've been looking for you anyway...<eos> I imagine to discuss your recent adventures in Lebanon.<eos> I don't know who I can trust there.<eos> But you trust me.<eos> Peter Quinn does.
The simple answer is usually the correct one.<eos> Nothing simple about Israel sabotaging one of our operations.<eos> What?<eos> Aren't we going to your place?<eos> I won't be able to sleep tonight.<eos> I thought I'd go in and get a head start on the OpSec review.<eos> Don't forget your bag.<eos> What if he doesn't get better?<eos> He will.<eos> What if he doesn't?
Allison.<eos> I was beginning to think you weren't coming.<eos> Yet here I am.<eos> How are you?<eos> - How am I? - Mm-hmm.<eos> How the hell do you think I am?<eos> Oh, I think you should be satisfied.<eos> Look. All went as planned.<eos> Ticktock... all is good.<eos> It did not.
- He never showed.<eos> - So it's just a coincidence you were there?<eos> Yeah, a troubling one, I admit.<eos> Troubling?<eos> The night before you were giving me an earful about regime change in Damascus.<eos> Another coincidence, I'm afraid.<eos> I'm sure you can see how this looks from where I'm standing.<eos> We didn't do it, Saul.<eos> We didn't murder the general you never met to discuss the coup that you weren't planning.<eos> Well, somebody did.
- Of course.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Right here.<eos> I'm him.<eos> - So am I.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> Je suis Gabe H. Coud. Je suis Gabe H. Coud!<eos> Je suis Gabe H. Coud!<eos> Do you guys speak English?<eos> I do.
Well, then he's risen from the dead.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why I put up the rocket.<eos> I saw him one morning walking the neighborhood.<eos> I'd heard his father had been ill.<eos> You sure it was him?<eos> Up so close I could smell his cologne.<eos> Imagine my surprise learning you were here in Berlin.<eos> I assumed you knew.<eos> I didn't.
I've brought up your concerns to the first secretary on a number of occasions, and he's taken them up the chain.<eos> You're like an echo-- repeating the same thing over and over again.<eos> Did you know that it was here, in my country, where laws were first written down and organized into a system?<eos> Of course, the Hammurabi Code.<eos> Yes. A code for justice.<eos> That everyone had to live by.<eos> Rich and poor.<eos> Even the king.<eos> You said yesterday that you had something urgent to tell us.<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> We're listening.<eos> Saul.<eos> Couldn't risk calling.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> Everyone's furious at you.<eos> Including you?<eos> Including me.<eos> I take it you never heard from Carrie.<eos> No, I never did.
You're damaged goods.<eos> We're pulling you from the field.<eos> That's a mistake.<eos> I can rehabilitate myself.<eos> Already, I've talked my way back in this far.<eos> You will never be fully trusted. And we will never fully trust the information you are given access to.<eos> Wait a minute, damn it.<eos> Take your hands off me.<eos> The Kremlin can't seriously want this attack to go forward.<eos> They do.
I'm not busted. I can't be busted.<eos> I didn't send you two-year-old code.<eos> Though it is elegant.<eos> And familiar.<eos> Hmm? I was going through some of, uh, Mr. Palmer's old prototypes, and I found this.<eos> That was Ray's. I mean... Mr. Palmer's.<eos> I mean, this has code that's like identical to what you have on the phone.<eos> I mean, the question is, why is Mr. Palmer's prototype OS sending you texts on your phone?<eos> Ray must have connected the prototype's computer to the company's local area network.<eos> It did!
It's my dad.<eos> I think I did it.<eos> What do you know, Snow?<eos> I think you did do it.<eos> Velocity-6?<eos> This is what was so urgent, Harrison?<eos> You get me to come here so I can take your speed drug?<eos> That's right.<eos> - You knew about this.<eos> - Of course she did.
So, here's the thing.<eos> Amara seems to be growing in leaps and bounds.<eos> Not just in maturity, but in strength and confidence, too.<eos> I don't want her to get out of hand before I'm sure of her loyalty.<eos> I need you to stop overfeeding her.<eos> But you said to give her whatever she wants whenever she wants it.<eos> Well, now I'm saying something different, aren't I?<eos> Yes.<eos> We don't want a generation of entitled, pudgy kids, do we?<eos> No, we do not.
Is it bad?<eos> It could be worse.<eos> I'm gonna start sewing, and you're gonna tell me what the hell's going on here.<eos> Yesterday morning, I got an alert... That a pending interagency database search generated a result.<eos> Right away, I knew it was weird because the search was two years old, and it was instigated by a former agent named Kate Beckett.<eos> What was the search for?<eos> The document it uncovered was a just-declassified electronic memo, heavily redacted.<eos> From what I could tell, it detailed a meeting between a federal official of some kind and senator William Bracken.<eos> When I started at the A.G.'S office, I ran a keyword search, hunting for criminality connected to Bracken, and I never got a hit.<eos> Well, yesterday, you did.
! It's the hypocrisy that I can't stand!<eos> What?<eos> It's ok for you to do whatever you have to for your sister, but it's not ok for me to do the same to mine?<eos> Sara was dead.<eos> Thea wasn't.<eos> Then why didn't you tell me about Thea seven months ago?<eos> Because you don't see me as an equal.<eos> What? Oh, come on.<eos> Laurel, of course I see you as an equal.<eos> No, you don't!
I know this is more than a little crazy.<eos> Yeah, well, your friend with the creepy ring asked so nicely.<eos> Please tell me we're not going to negotiate with terrorists.<eos> Or, you know, 4,000 year old bad guys.<eos> Just think of this more as a fact-finding mission.<eos> Maybe Savage slips up and gives us something that we can use to our advantage.<eos> Thea said you were being a little more humorous lately.<eos> I'm sorry, how do you know so much about Savage, anyway?<eos> I don't know anything about him, Mr. Allen.<eos> No one does.
Because there was a reflection in Jesse's eye of Mr. Jiggle Wiggle.<eos> And that's the thing that my dad...<eos> It doesn't even matter.<eos> That's why you came here alone without any backup?<eos> Because of your father?<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> I know that you're being reckless.<eos> And I'm sure the people in your life care enough about you to not want to see you get hurt.<eos> Except Mardon didn't kill my father.<eos> I did.
What is Valerie doing with Stefan's journal?<eos> Entry for July 15, 1863, should tell you why.<eos> Stefan, voice-over: I met a girl.<eos> Her name is Valerie, and she may be the most wonderful girl I have ever met.<eos> She has Elena.<eos> And I'm the only one who knows where she is.<eos> She has Caroline, she has Elena.<eos> This is her plan.<eos> Then we don't let her fracture us.<eos> Or we do.
Can I help you?<eos> It's ok.<eos> I speak mute.<eos> Just communicate what you want with a series of grunts.<eos> Ah! You'll have to excuse Beau.<eos> He's not in the mood for glib jokes.<eos> None of us are, actually.<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
He's never gonna agree to it.<eos> Donovan knows plan "B" is, I just simply kill him.<eos> It's good to see your morality is holding up in Elena's absence.<eos> So are you and Carebear, like, a thing now, hmm?<eos> I'm not doing this with you, Damon.<eos> I'm just saying, when a guy's willing to let another guy die so his girl can live, there's usually something, chk, cooking in the kitchen.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I am not willing to let Matt die.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you just did, brother.
I'd do anything, anything she wanted, to shut you up.<eos> This is her plan.<eos> She's slowly taking away everything we care about.<eos> She wants us to be mad at each other.<eos> You're right.<eos> You and I fight...<eos> While her and her family of freaks live in our house, getting closer and closer.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then we don't let her fracture us.<eos> Or we do.
You are such a strong girl.<eos> I am so sorry I didn't see it sooner.<eos> My son...<eos> Please forgive me.<eos> Kill me!<eos> Come on.<eos> Do it, Lily.<eos> You're wrong about so many things.<eos> I never had the courage to tell you before...<eos> But I do now.
The sister has been researching the medallion since it's been in the Mikaelsons' possession.<eos> By end of day, we'll have what is ours, and we'll have taken care of the only witch willing to protect them.<eos> I think I prefer the bottom the murky sea to that restroom.<eos> Still hungry, are we?<eos> I'm not hungry, I'm angry...<eos> Staked your ex, drowned by Nik's. You two need a lesson in women.<eos> Could the lesson not be yours to learn, Rebekah?<eos> Didn't you damn one of them to eternity, viciously antagonize the other?<eos> Those lunatics actually believe the prophecy.<eos> You don't, do you?
Don't say tired.<eos> You've lived long enough to know you should never tell a woman she looks tired.<eos> I was going to say contemplative. Ha.<eos> A penny for your thoughts.<eos> I was thinking about you and what Rebekah said.<eos> Is she right?<eos> Do you see me as this fragile thing that needs to be kept behind glass to protect me from Aurora...<eos> Please.<eos> When I think of all the ways she could have hurt you...<eos> She didn't. Klaus, she didn't...
More stories!<eos> More stories!<eos> Hey, tell one where Peter is a nincompoop or maybe a Silly Billy.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Okay, let's just carve the turkey.<eos> Oh, Aunt Karen already carved it.<eos> She did?<eos> But that's my thing.<eos> I always do my "are you a leg man or a breast man" joke.<eos> Aunt Karen did that, too.
Mostly I dealt with people under him.<eos> I know he's some sort of international consultant.<eos> It is true, I am not the first consultant in the family, but the title is where the similarities end.<eos> Father's business exists to grease the skids so that politicians and corporations can operate around the globe.<eos> Sometimes these are noble ventures.<eos> More often, they are not.<eos> But they happen because Father is an influence peddler par excellence.<eos> And if he says he can restore us, he means it.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I did not.
I don't want him in there.<eos> It's not your choice.<eos> I'm going.<eos> - Just be careful.<eos> - Always.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> You gambled.<eos> If it had worked, you'd be a hero.<eos> Yeah, but it didn't.
You are free to return home.<eos> You okay?<eos> That was Indur, walked out. Zero's father.<eos> And that's what's left of Zero's rifle?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Figure his old man should have it.<eos> I'll bring it to him.<eos> Nah. This one's on me.<eos> You can't think that's a good idea.<eos> - I don't.
Alak kept his gun from the militia.<eos> There are two bullets left inside, both meant for you.<eos> One from Rafe, one from Christie.<eos> He keeps it by the front door. I would not recommend knocking.<eos> Thank you for telling me.<eos> He's been through a lot.<eos> Yes.<eos> We all have.<eos> You still have me, Favi.<eos> That I do, Andina.

How are they?<eos> Sleeping.<eos> Everyone seems fine.<eos> Well, thank God for that.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> Chavez is dead.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, man, Nick, you didn't...<eos> No, I didn't kill her.<eos> Well, who did?
Trubel killed her to save my life.<eos> Oh, Nick, I thought she got away with the Royals.<eos> No, she never left.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Thank you for doing this.<eos> Thanks, uh, but I need a little bit of help.<eos> Can you?<eos> Of course.<eos> Got anything on Wemlinger?<eos> 'Cause I don't.
Marcus...<eos> This is Danny, Alex's partner.<eos> And Scottie.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Cheers.<eos> You didn't know, did you?<eos> How smart he was?<eos> I knew.<eos> But not really.<eos> Not in the way you did, no.
There has to be some limit on where he could hide it.<eos> The wheelchair.<eos> It's logical that he hides it somewhere inside the chair.<eos> That way it's with him but not on him, and it's never found.<eos> You have to get it by 9:45, because Toby says it takes 15 minutes for the drugs to kick in, and you have to be dead before Ten-Ton comes to kill you.<eos> I can't believe that sentence makes sense.<eos> Okay, you got to go.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I believe in you;<eos> the whole team does.
- Well, we fight for Eoferwic because we do not wish to see England, piece by piece, become Daneland.<eos> I heard it said that we were pagans once.<eos> That wooden and Odin are the same.<eos> We saw the error of our ways, and we look to Rome.<eos> I heard the pagans had fierce gods of war.<eos> Well, we are right and they are mistaken.<eos> Osbert, we are blessed.<eos> I should make you swear on St. Cuthbert's comb never to mention the likes of wooden again.<eos> But what if I had a hound called wooden?<eos> - What if I did?
Uhtred, what are you doing?<eos> What is it, farmer? First blood or to the death?<eos> Uhtred!<eos> I'll be splitting your skull, boy. So one follows the other.<eos> Uhtred?<eos> Father Beocca.<eos> My goodness.<eos> You know this assling, Father?<eos> I do.<eos> Yes, I do.
Are you kidding?<eos> It'd be the same if it was us.<eos> That doesn't make you worry?<eos> Riss, okay...<eos> Look, I know you've been kind of messed up lately, dealing with a lot of stuff.<eos> But that... that guy, there... that is something you don't have to worry about.<eos> - You're right. - Yeah.<eos> - You're always right.<eos> - You always know how to make me feel better.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yeah, so I overdosed.<eos> And now I feel like all you've done is babysit me.<eos> Like you've all put me under a microscope.<eos> Well, you have been acting kind of strange lately.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Am I not perky enough for you?<eos> You've been looking at me like I'm some sort of psycho!<eos> Oh, do you think she might try something?<eos> - I didn't think you could hear me.<eos> - Well, sweetheart, I did.
Did Mason tell you to lie like that, or should I speak to him directly?<eos> Look, we all have the same goal:<eos> to get you what you want.<eos> We have two more buyers today and the sports museum visit tomorrow.<eos> And I'd like to take you to dinner tonight.<eos> - That's not necessary.<eos> - Look, I want to. I want to.<eos> I lost my dad when I was 12... and I know what it was like to me and for my mother.<eos> I wanna help you.<eos> I do.
No, stop.<eos> - ‭Stop! - Hey, what's going on?<eos> Oh, your sister and I are having a little fun.<eos> Great news.<eos> The Georgia Woman's Association accepted our bid to do the flowers for its fundraising gala.<eos> That is great.<eos> Awesome, Nicole.<eos> It's gonna be a lot of work, but it'll really raise our profile.<eos> And, Ryan, they loved your work And they want you to do the photography.<eos> Of course they did, terrific.
Dana, you're sleeping a lot.<eos> And locking yourself away in your basement workshop, it's not good.<eos> And all this online shopping, sweetie, I'm worried.<eos> You taking your medication?<eos> I told you already, I don't need to.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Ok.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Ryan wants to take you and me out tonight to Lombardi's for a special dinner.<eos> - He does?
- It's miles better.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah, it's not even comparable.<eos> It's like high school here is more difficult than American undergraduate work.<eos> How do you say in Slovenian, "Any American student can come here and go to university for free?"<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Slow, slow.<eos> Do you use the regular alphabet here?<eos> A-B-C-D-E-F-G?<eos> Yes, we do.
Are you both okay?<eos> Let's get Tracy home.<eos> You saw the whole thing, didn't you?<eos> Hey, you handled it beautifully.<eos> How did you know I was here? I paired with one of D.B.'s pacifiers.<eos> Uh, thank you for letting me get Michelle today.<eos> Family comes first.<eos> Yeah, I-I... thought I had it all under control.<eos> I, um...<eos> I don't.
Come on.<eos> This is premeditated murder, Emma.<eos> There had to be another way.<eos> You should have come to us.<eos> And risk losing someone else?<eos> I thought the best way to control the darkness was to isolate myself. But when I did that, there was no one around to give me hope or tell me when I was being stupid!<eos> Fine. You're being stupid. So stop it.<eos> Right now, we have to clean up this mess.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
Well, then you get to spend your last moments with your mother.<eos> We were so close, Mary Margaret.<eos> Emma was seconds away from destroying the darkness and ending this.<eos> And Hook would have been dead.<eos> She chose love, David.<eos> And we would have done the same thing. We'd share one heart because we took the same kind of risk that Emma took.<eos> We save each other.<eos> That is what our family does.<eos> So have some faith in her.<eos> I do.
But I am.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> That future you told me not to be afraid of... We can have it.<eos> The house in Storybrooke.<eos> I'm not afraid anymore.<eos> I want it.<eos> With you.<eos> It's ours.<eos> You just have to want it, too.<eos> Aye, love, I do.
Nobody ran away.<eos> I was shooting at them with my slingshot.<eos> I hit a few of them.<eos> It was a dramatic and difficult night.<eos> People didn't talk.<eos> They just were looking into each other's eyes, into each other's soul.<eos> I have never seen such courage.<eos> I was watching people and wondering, "When will they run?"<eos> And I'd understand, if they did.<eos> But they didn't.
I said hands where I can see 'em.<eos> There is nothing in that bag.<eos> Gun!<eos> No!<eos> I've just been upstaged.<eos> No! What did you do?<eos> She had a gun.<eos> What did you do?<eos> - She had a gun.<eos> - No, she didn't!
His father once said,<eos> "I don't know where his talent comes from," and stated on more than one occasion that he considered his son a mystery.<eos> IMPEY: Wernher von Braun was multitalented.<eos> Both sides of his brain were working.<eos> He could think about technical things and imagine rocketry and space travel, but he was an accomplished musician.<eos> And these traits manifested very early.<eos> I think his parents knew by the time he was four or five that he was very special.<eos> His mother gave him a telescope when he was young, and he looked at the moon and said, "I want to go there.<eos> I want to build the machine that will go to the moon."<eos> And of course he did half a century later.
You do still have an eye on our boy, don't you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Great. Great.<eos> - Not exactly.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Where is he?<eos> - Nice trick.<eos> Well, I'm sure you're a hit at parties.<eos> - So... you think you're ready.<eos> - I do.
Damn it, Les, we're supposed to--<eos> Hey, what about, "Thank you, Les.<eos> That was very thoughtful of you, Les."<eos> No problem, man.<eos> Don't sweat it.<eos> How about we were supposed to be layin' low, Les.<eos> How about-- who the hell died and made you the boss, man?<eos> As I remember, you were out making a Booty call. Hey!<eos> She ain't got nothin' to do with this.<eos> The hell she don't.
I know that place like the back of my hand.<eos> My dad used to take me hunting up there.<eos> Look, here's the campground... Try and get some rest, ok, baby?<eos> But I'm not tired. I'm hungry.<eos> We'll get you something to eat soon.<eos> Mama, can I play on your phone?<eos> Oh, baby, mama forgot it.<eos> We're gonna get you something to eat soon, I promise.<eos> He needs to eat.<eos> We all do.
I can't explain this, unless he went back in time and forged it in the Revolution.<eos> Well, that would be impossible.<eos> I know. But there's no question.<eos> The handwriting belongs to Ichabod Crane.<eos> I'm hoping you can help me with a little problem I'm having.<eos> I can't seem to figure out what these two people have in common.<eos> They're both my patients.<eos> But oddly enough, neither one of them got the meds that you ordered for them three days ago. Then maybe you should talking to the nursing staff.<eos> They never got the order because the patients didn't need the meds.<eos> Sarah Lippman did.
As long as you're connected to us... There's going to be a target on your back.<eos> You let us go, there's a chance it goes away.<eos> Harvey, if I was just going to out you loose because someone hates you, I wouldn't have hired you in the first place.<eos> Because we both know I used to hate you.<eos> Thanks, Dominic.<eos> So, what are we gonna do?<eos> I'll let you know. But I'll tell you this.<eos> If they want a war, they got a war.<eos> Hey, Rach, do you have that Neilson brief for Louis from last month?<eos> No, I don't.
So, will you stop worrying, or do I need to take you into one of these empty rooms to make you relax?<eos> Miss Guthrie, hi.<eos> We're the...<eos> The lawyers.<eos> I know.<eos> I won't lie for them.<eos> Lie?<eos> No.<eos> We just want to know if you saw Catherine and Caleb the night Helena was killed. No.<eos> No one on my staff did.
Or because you were slicing your aunt's throat. No!<eos> God, no.<eos> Then why do we have surveillance footage that puts you one block from your aunt's car? That's impossible.<eos> I run the same route every night...<eos> River Road to the park and then back home.<eos> That's nowhere near where they found her car, so if that's me on that tape...<eos> Don't you get it now?<eos> Someone's framing us.<eos> Where'd you find that footage of Caleb?<eos> I didn't.
- So you think Mr. Lahey did it?<eos> - Yes. Because then you don't go away for this murder.<eos> Your Honor, this line of questioning is completely...<eos> No need to object, Ms. Sinclair.<eos> In fact, maybe I should join you over here, since we agree on so much.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Shall we try this one together?<eos> Make your point, Ms. Rothlo.<eos> You killed your husband on your own, didn't you, Ms. Keating?<eos> - No, I did not.
Come on in, come on in.<eos> Okay.<eos> My God, you are, like, so pretty.<eos> Come here.<eos> Sorry, that's dinner.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sawyer, dinner time!<eos> Smells good.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.
Okay.<eos> My God, you are, like, so pretty.<eos> Come here.<eos> Sorry, that's dinner.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sawyer, dinner time!<eos> Smells good.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Patterson.<eos> This matter's not closed.<eos> What do you got?<eos> A hostage crisis in an MWA building in Queens.<eos> Two gunmen reported five minutes ago.<eos> Reade and Zapata are en route.<eos> MWA?<eos> Municipal Workers Association.<eos> So, what, two gunmen five minutes ago, NYPD called us already?<eos> No, they didn't.
What does that suggest to you?<eos> It suggests she had a get-away-quick kit stashed under her bed.<eos> It's standard practice for any operator in the field.<eos> She took the bullet train from Shenzhen to Hong Kong and was last observed roaming around Chungking Mansions, just around the corner from your guesthouse.<eos> Coincidence.<eos> Maybe, but it might lead a reasonable person to think that you supplied her with the passport.<eos> If I was going to get her out of the country, she'd be out of the country.<eos> That's what I told them.<eos> And they still insist on an interview.<eos> Yes, they do.
Why did you lie to Al about not having met her?<eos> Because it was none of anybody's business.<eos> An asset decides to abandon her post, and that's nobody's business?<eos> She was leaving her husband.<eos> It was an emotional decision, but it was hers to make.<eos> Her husband was having an affair with a Chinese man, and I suspect that they're trying to recruit him and turned the screws by threatening to arrest his wife, which they've now fucking done.<eos> All of which you should know from your own fucking assets, but don't!<eos> Who took the snaps?<eos> I think that's it for tonight.<eos> Do you really?
We'll be out of here soon enough.<eos> After you, your Emissary.<eos> Savior of the human race wasn't good enough for you, huh Murphy?<eos> Needed to be the alien ambassador too.<eos> I'm working my way up to Supreme Leader of the Planet.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Dan.<eos> Dan Scully.<eos> And I bet you don't believe any of this alien exodus crap either do you?<eos> No, we don't.
And you hallucinate on this stuff, right?<eos> Big time.<eos> Good.<eos> Cuz right now there's a three foot tall raven right next to you.<eos> How's your pain doing?<eos> Feeling no pain, doc.<eos> In fact, I'm gonna refer all my patients to you.<eos> Hey, you wanna see something over here?<eos> Are they talking to you too?<eos> They always do.
No, I just like to play in general, Detective.<eos> What about you?<eos> So, you had a conversation with the dead guy.<eos> Oh, no, he wasn't quite dead.<eos> His soul hadn't crossed the threshold.<eos> I see.<eos> Did he tell you why he did it?<eos> Why money, of course.<eos> You humans, you love your money, don't you?<eos> Yes. Yes, we do.
Said it was a big secret, some...<eos> some, uh... uh, rich married guy.<eos> Well, did she have a friend that she might have confided in?<eos> She didn't trust no one, man.<eos> Uh... uh... a therapist.<eos> A therapist is probably the only one who knows.<eos> She sees some, uh... uh, Doctor Linda in... in Beverly Hills.<eos> Saw her like five times a week on the DL.<eos> Used a fake name, everything.<eos> Oh, did she now?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I know something you don't know.<eos> Really?<eos> What's that?<eos> Won't say unless you take me with you on this.<eos> Please. Come on. I got you Too Vile, didn't I?<eos> Why do you care about this so much?<eos> About Delilah?<eos> Look, I just...<eos> I just do.
I love you so much!<eos> - Good job standing up to the mean girl.<eos> - Thanks, Mommy.<eos> What's a hooker?<eos> Daddy'll tell you.<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> Bye Lucifer, it was nice meeting you.<eos> Hmph!<eos> Think she likes you.<eos> Course she does.
Moving the fridge, opening the small door, latching the front door throwing keys, moving the fridge again...<eos> All in a flash!<eos> Are they Spiderman and Superwoman?<eos> What are they?<eos> And after all that planning, the blood-stained whiskey bottle on the table they didn't clear that up?<eos> L-low come'?<eos> Because they weren't professional killers.<eos> Sir, it's simple if a father sees his daughter's dead body will he cry standing outside the room or run to hug her?<eos> Has your daughter died? Do you know what it feels like to lose a child?<eos> And you do?
- Why you gotta be like that?<eos> - Well, this stinks.<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> We beat it! Still scared?<eos> More than ever.<eos> If something happens to me, I want you to have my adorable sweaters.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Chin up, guys!<eos> - We don't have chins.<eos> - Sure we do.
Why didn't you wake me up?<eos> I could have gone to the hospital.<eos> I could have seen them!<eos> They didn't make it to the hospital, sweetheart, and--and I didn't want to tell you until I had to.<eos> How could you do this to me?<eos> How could you not wake me up?<eos> What are you doing up so early?<eos> Oh, nothing, just going through this old box of stuff.<eos> Does that have something to do with you seeing Trevor last night?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it does.
I'm just hoping it's not too late to make it up to Marcus.<eos> Anyway, that's my news.<eos> What--what did you want to talk about?<eos> Nothing. I met a girl. Great.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Scottie.<eos> I'm just trying to figure out the long distance thing.<eos> All I can tell you there is, if she's the one, you'll know, just like with me and your mother.<eos> So you didn't tell him?<eos> No, I didn't.
I am a good person.<eos> You're a person that wants to have their cake and eat it, too.<eos> And I'm afraid that I'm all out of cake with you.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> It means that I've often wondered whether or not I did the right thing by not having you arrested that day.<eos> That would have completely screwed up my life.<eos> Oh, and look at how not screwed up it is right now.<eos> You want to know what kind of man I am?<eos> You wanted to see me, Father?<eos> Yes, I did.
Michael, I think you came to see me because when people are in crisis they're searching for something more, usually something they've lost.<eos> I lost my parents, and I'm not getting them back.<eos> No, Michael, you lost your faith.<eos> Grammy.<eos> The day after you left school she gave me the money back.<eos> Her only request was that we use some of it to buy this bookcase to keep these books together.<eos> They're my father's books.<eos> And your mother's.<eos> I never knew why she did it.<eos> And now I do.
Look.<eos> I've never been one to back off a story, and after that man came to threaten me, uh, "smash my face in with an ash tray"<eos> were his exact words, I knew there had to be more to the Brukner story than just some stolen art.<eos> So I kept digging, and I found this.<eos> Email correspondence between Mr. Brukner and Councilman Dorch laying out a quid pro quo deal in which Mr. Brukner would fund the new hospital wing in Dorch's district, in exchange for zoning variances on two of Mr. Brukner's real estate projects.<eos> All these details are posted to my blog, and I'll continue posting updates.<eos> It's Brukner.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I thought you fixed this guy's wagon months ago.<eos> I did.
Okay, can I ask?<eos> How can I be his ideal woman, and five minutes after we break up, he's dating some barista who can't even properly use the possessive apostrophe?<eos> Did you Facebook stalk?<eos> No.<eos> A little.<eos> Well, whoever she is, she's probably very simple and very needy, and that's exactly what he wants right now.<eos> You know you could do the same.<eos> That cyber security guy clearly has an eye for you.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> Does he?
I just want to ask you a few questions.<eos> I didn't kill Pearson and I didn't take the baby.<eos> I got a gallery opening tonight.<eos> Are we done?<eos> No. We're not done.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I'll start with the obvious.<eos> Do you know Morpheus' identity?<eos> No.<eos> Nobody does.
The condo development controversy?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> That's been an issue here for a while.<eos> Something else triggered her arrival.<eos> Well, then what happened two months ago?<eos> The mother and child died in the overheated car.<eos> And that was Morpheus' first piece of art in Detroit, the one that she used her half of the blanket in.<eos> Garcia. Yes, sir.<eos> Of all the women on your list, did any lose a child?<eos> Uh, 3 did.
Ok.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Cover the back.<eos> This way.<eos> Come on.<eos> William, please listen to me.<eos> Shut up.<eos> No. I know what you're feeling.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'll go get Agent Miller.<eos> The woman wants to be in on everything.<eos> Not this.<eos> These are photos Angela was able to retrieve from Agent Bannerman's cloud account.<eos> Looks to me like Agent Miller wasn't just Bannerman's partner.<eos> When were these taken?<eos> Six months ago.<eos> Bannerman deleted them after he met Chloe Robertson.<eos> I take it Agent Miller didn't tell you about this relationship?<eos> No, she did not.
He's just whipped.<eos> Don't I know you somehow?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Go wait by the door.<eos> So we have a deal?<eos> You cross me, and I will skin you and your girlfriend alive and make myself a brand-new pair of calzones.<eos> - Whatever those are.<eos> - One, two, three, four!<eos> - He bought it.<eos> - Yes, he did.
Where was he dropped off?<eos> This guy's house...<eos> Milton Cicero.<eos> Works in sanitation.<eos> Word is he's totally mobbed up.<eos> If our vic was doing research for his book and he asked too many questions, Milton here might have gotten suspicious and taken Dave out.<eos> Okay.<eos> He did come to my house, but I didn't kill him...<eos> I swear. - So, how do you know him?<eos> - I don't.
Two collars for assault, including one with a deadly weapon.<eos> You know, maybe Eric and Dave were working a con together and something went wrong.<eos> Any idea where Eric is now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I pinged his cell. We got a location. Let's go pick him up.<eos> Evidence room.<eos> Yeah, this is Captain Beckett.<eos> Do we still have the seized heroin from the Vulcan Simmons case? Hang on.<eos> Let me check. Yeah, I'll hold.<eos> Yes, we do.
We're screwed.<eos> Catching him with that empty thumb drive was our whole conspiracy charge.<eos> Did it work?<eos> Did what work?<eos> Are you the one that turned the lights out?<eos> I-I told her to do that.<eos> Why in the hell would you do that?<eos> Well, I thought our "midnight run" stratagem needed a little twist.<eos> Trust me, guys... if this works, we're gonna have him on a whole lot more than just obstruction.<eos> What if it doesn't?
Trust me, I know which wire to cut.<eos> It's not a problem.<eos> We may have a problem.<eos> Kara, do you have the live... Oh, uh, live, plus seven-day ratings for the Midwest satellite stations. - There.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Um, how you doing?<eos> - Handling.<eos> Digital called, sounds like you are, too.<eos> - That guy knows Superman, right?<eos> - Yes, he does.
You have to cancel it.<eos> I won't be intimidated by a terrorist.<eos> Why are you fighting me?<eos> I'm trying to protect your train.<eos> I don't put much faith in the government's idea of protection.<eos> I read your file.<eos> Your parents were doctors who developed vaccines against bio-weapons.<eos> They worked for the government.<eos> They didn't see it as the enemy.<eos> No, they didn't.
No, she doesn't, she ended it.<eos> Because she felt you chose Superman over her.<eos> She was tired of coming in second.<eos> Look, I don't know anything about romantic love.<eos> I have not had the best luck with it.<eos> But if I ever really had it, I think I'd fight for it.<eos> I already put that behind me, Kara.<eos> I don't want to go back there.<eos> I don't want to do that again.<eos> Who does?
You never make a joke. School!<eos> School, you have to go to school.<eos> You're gonna be late.<eos> The car is downstairs waiting for you.<eos> Did you brush your teeth? Bye, buddy!<eos> It was fun hanging out with you.<eos> - Bye, Kara.<eos> - Oh!<eos> Mom, Kara and I had an epic Nerf gun battle...<eos> Yeah, we did.
Check it out.<eos> I got my kale, my carrots, my B3, my agave.<eos> I got my bacon chili cheeseburger deluxe.<eos> That's my Triple P cranial laxative.<eos> Any closer to getting Penn's digital files?<eos> Like I told you-- Penn's a guy who's written about the NSA, the FBI, the IRS and all other alphabet agencies that make men tremble.<eos> So you can't get in.<eos> Dude, his encryptions got encryptions.<eos> But once that agave and this saturated fat lubricates the thinkanator-- oh, I'll get there.<eos> I always do.
Too formal.<eos> You look lovely.<eos> Thanks.<eos> No tie, okay, all right.<eos> You're nervous?<eos> Just a little bit.<eos> I haven't had a first date since...<eos> Watergate.<eos> Do you have an opening line?<eos> I do. Um...
Yeah, you did, at... at that.<eos> Speaking of getting the job done, Wally, I fixed everything in here.<eos> Patched all the walls, repaired all the pipe fittings, so no more leakage.<eos> What is that? What?<eos> That.<eos> Nothing, just...<eos> a T-shirt.<eos> You are not part of Scorpion.<eos> But I live here.<eos> So does a possum in the rafters.

WOLOWITZ:
Is she wanting to be won back?<eos> When we first met, it was my roguish charm that caused Beckett to drop her guard, but it was my sherlockian skills that made her fall in love with me.<eos> I just have to solve a few cases with her to show her that, together, we are still magic.<eos> Richard, you do know that you cannot just barge your way into the precinct and talk your way onto a case anymore.<eos> I am a licensed private investigator.<eos> I don't need a precinct to solve a case.<eos> Now, this tattoo was on the body of a dead convict found in Central Park.<eos> I know I've seen it somewhere before.<eos> I just don't know where.<eos> I do.
Do you understand?<eos> Anton...<eos> Bozek is in.<eos> He's willing to hold a referendum on autonomy in Eastern Ukraine?<eos> Provided you pull your troops out and it's supervised by the UN, yes.<eos> Bring the generals, and I'll bring Ukraine.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Well, Mike B's furious.<eos> He saw the picture, too?<eos> Of course he did.

She said you used to play it for her.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Did she tell you she had a sister?<eos> Ricki.<eos> Fredericka.<eos> I am.<eos> Heard a lot about you, Cayman.<eos> Can't say it's nice to meet you though. What do you want?<eos> I want you to tell the truth.<eos> Just like Matt Hildebrandt did. Security breach!

I will say this, the video tells one story, the officer involved tells another, and they both can't be telling the truth.<eos> We can't help unless we have full access to all the information.<eos> I've answered every question I can, handed over every camera and computer that we've got...<eos> I need to speak with the officer involved.<eos> I want a name.<eos> That's not gonna happen, Agent Ryan.<eos> Department policy.<eos> We don't release any information, to anyone, until we complete our internal review.<eos> Uh, Chief Richards, look, we-we all want the same thing here, the truth.<eos> Do we?

I told them to look for you.<eos> Best I could do.<eos> Now then, your reward.<eos> I can equip you with a decade worth of gasoline, bullets, a vehicle, five vehicles.<eos> Yeah, we'll... we'll take all that.<eos> Take them where, do you think?<eos> Somewhere without zombies.<eos> And where's that?<eos> You have zombies here.<eos> Sure, we do.
Come drink with me!<eos> Kurian.<eos> Kurian!<eos> Kurian!<eos> What is the matter with you?<eos> Well congratulations.<eos> All those Zeros out there, all the ones I just vaccinated, they're under your control now.<eos> They're your new army.<eos> Well then the plan worked.<eos> No, it didn't.
Yo, sh-- (Laughter)<eos> Fucking graffiti, man!<eos> They're gonna kick us off the air 'cause of this shit.<eos> I'm there making music, go from 1:00 to 5:00. No commercial break.<eos> I can't go to the bathroom.<eos> (Laughs) I never thought about that.<eos> It was hectic, man, or I did, I had to--<eos> (Rolls tongue, imitates peeing)<eos> Did you ever wash your hands though between?<eos> I still don't.
- Is that what a family man would do?<eos> - I did.<eos> Well, I went one better.<eos> I gave you and your mom hell.<eos> I spent the housekeeping on women.<eos> I lived it up every night at bars and clubs.<eos> I lost everything gambling and got into debt.<eos> I had you pay my debts.<eos> But now I wonder... If I did the right thing.<eos> I did, though.
Son, you don't seem aware your name means "power".<eos> 'Solidarity comes of joining forces.'<eos> 'Never let go of people standing by you.'<eos> 'Run to help them in trouble.' Didn't I tell you that? C'mon.<eos> I don't remember anything like it, Mom.<eos> How can you not remember?<eos> Your cousins came over once.<eos> You wouldn't let them play with your toys.<eos> - I told you then, remember?<eos> - No, you didn't, Mom.
So?<eos> Then what did you do?<eos> I started coming here every night.<eos> In the hope of seeing again.<eos> Then I became friends with the clown.<eos> I told him my troubles.<eos> He took me on and trained me.<eos> I began to perform every night.<eos> I hoped she might turn up and see me.<eos> But she never did.
All my life I did what they wanted.<eos> Everyone sniffed at me.<eos> I was invisible to them.<eos> Even my kids... They left me, you know?<eos> You can't know what that means.<eos> The only thing I had... The only place I didn't feel alone was my car...<eos> Midnight Minx.<eos> And they took her from me because of you.<eos> So don't come with me, pal.<eos> Just don't.
So, I removed any permutations that wouldn't work with that theory.<eos> You know, area codes never start with number 1 or have the same three numbers in a row, right?<eos> Right. Out of the remaining combinations, there was one active phone number.<eos> How did you find out that last part?<eos> Consul General left his laptop open when you two were in the hall, so I hacked a few cellphone carriers.<eos> 702 is a Vegas number.<eos> I think someone wants you to call.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I thought we had no more business together.<eos> We don't.
But after the government's Precrime program was shut down, they were finally released.<eos> They kept themselves safe and hidden from the world, until now.<eos> - No, I was just, um...<eos> Obsessing over your father's case files?<eos> It's just, there's nothing in any of these about the blind drug dealer Dina Winter talked about, Lycon.<eos> Because the files are just shells.<eos> Most of the data didn't get converted during the system upgrade 15 years ago.<eos> So until someone syncs the two, the old evidence might as well be stuck on Mars.<eos> - We know how to get to Mars.<eos> - We do.
I die.<eos> We call that an eyewitness.<eos> So you're in your bedroom.<eos> Is it day or night?<eos> Can you tell what time it is?<eos> I heard a whip-poor-will.<eos> It's a local bird that makes its call - just around sunset.<eos> - That gives us until tomorrow night, at least.<eos> - Or it already happened.<eos> - It didn't.
Powerful people want to put us back in a milk bath prison.<eos> Maybe our government, maybe another.<eos> We're always gonna be hunted.<eos> I'd prefer that wasn't the case.<eos> You?<eos> I'd keep it. Why?<eos> Seeing people get slaughtered and not make a dime?<eos> Yeah, that part's tough.<eos> But I have a chance to save them.<eos> Not many people do.
You want me to punch you, right?<eos> I have business to attend to.<eos> More fun with wind farms.<eos> Was that a good call or a bad one?<eos> Father should start packing his bags.<eos> I hope the two of you haven't been waiting long.<eos> We were well attended to.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> I was worried something happened when you left so suddenly the other night.<eos> Something did.
Detective Vega.<eos> Heard you might be stopping by for a visit.<eos> - I'm touched.<eos> - Don't be.<eos> Who's he?<eos> New partner?<eos> Oh, I'm jealous.<eos> We're here on business.<eos> Well, I thought you just missed me.<eos> I do.
Look at how this wall buckled.<eos> It would have to be a super high detonation velocity to cause this kind of damage. Very high brisance.<eos> Yeah, well, I usually like my brisance with a little bit of jelly in a café with Pepé Le Pew.<eos> Oh, you mean the other kind of brisance?<eos> The shattering capability of a high explosive.<eos> Like Binetex.<eos> Exactly like Binetex, actually.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> I just don't understand why Sam would protect some guy that may have killed three people.<eos> I don't.

All right?<eos> It's gonna be a TV show. Me and Monte take over the world.<eos> That's all he said?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The mere fact that Chad Brunson got the names of the team members responsible for taking down his brother-- it's troubling.<eos> Well, if that information came from inside NCIS, it's more than just troubling.<eos> - Oh, of course, I agree.<eos> - There's a good chance the mole we apprehended last year gave up this information before we got him.<eos> And we still don't know who he was working for?<eos> We don't.
He's got a '68 Stingray and a '75911.<eos> These are all Corvette parts. He doesn't have anything for the Porsche.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Plastique, detonator wire, cash.<eos> Still got your lawyer on the phone?<eos> We found equipment that ties you to four different bombings.<eos> That's just at a glance.<eos> You're Taurus, and you're going to jail for the rest of your life.<eos> The only choice you have left is whether or not you want to cooperate with us.<eos> And if I do?
I just...<eos> I don't even know what that would be.<eos> 'Cause you guys are living together and sharing the same room.<eos> No, that's just 'cause I get scared.<eos> We're not sleeping together, we're just sleeping next to each other.<eos> So, I guess you know Meisner.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> If it wasn't for him, I probably wouldn't be alive.<eos> Did he tell you anything about me?<eos> He didn't, no.
His name is Andrew Dixon.<eos> I know him to be honest, hardworking, and as concerned about this city as I am.<eos> Go to his website, learn more about what he stands for.<eos> I hope you vote in this election, and I urge you to vote for Andrew Dixon.<eos> And that's a cut.<eos> How was that?<eos> Was that all right?<eos> It was great. Just what we need.<eos> You don't need me to do another one?<eos> Actually, I do.
Lawyer Jatala told Preeti the difference between Shinda and Ekom.<eos> This has become the biggest trouble for me.<eos> Preeti, I want to ask you something about Shinda's friend Nicky<eos> Nicky was a very close friend of mine too.<eos> But after Sunny and Shinda left, we never met.<eos> My life is over after Sunny left.<eos> I have cut off from everyone.<eos> Just from home to shop, shop to home.<eos> You have a picture of Nicky?<eos> Yes, I do.
"tamara craig."<eos> "kimberly payne."<eos> "monica segert."<eos> "amanda lombard."<eos> Call max-- tell him we just I.D.'d the last two vics.<eos> The aggregation of dust particles And general preservation of space Suggests our killer is somehow stuck in time.<eos> Steve: Yeah, it's like he's dedicated this room As a memorial of some kind.<eos> Perhaps for a woman who once lived here with him.<eos> Max: She looks like one of our victims.<eos> Yeah, she does.
Yeah, a whole lot of blood.<eos> We took a look at your car, Nina.<eos> And we found Nesbit's blood in the back of it.<eos> So that's not proof I'm a murderer.<eos> Also did some digging.<eos> Turns out that you grew up down the road from the fish farm where Nesbit's body was dumped.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> So I threw his body in the pond, but after his organs were properly distributed.<eos> Are you still claiming that you didn't kill him?<eos> Of course I didn't.
But you could send it to this address.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Of course.<eos> Safe travels.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So should I say it now or later?<eos> Fine.<eos> You told me so.<eos> I did, didn't I?
Maybe later.<eos> I thought you'd be glad to find Jared's ashes. No, I am.<eos> It's just, you know, you were right, Bones.<eos> Look, this wasn't about finding Jared's ashes, this was about my brother being gone.<eos> I know how much you miss him.<eos> I don't want the kids to wake up.<eos> You want to take the box?<eos> No, I tell you what, why don't we just leave it here so she can visit her brother in the morning.<eos> Girl really loves her brother, doesn't she?<eos> Yes, she does.
It's my original set.<eos> And I realize that most of this information is most likely on that "Internet," but you can never teach old-fashioned research habits too soon.<eos> How's the little guy doing? Oh, he's good.<eos> He's sleeping through the night for now, at least.<eos> Oh, and, Spence, I showed him the picture of when you first visited and he started kicking his little legs and he smiled real big.<eos> Who wouldn't get excited seeing that bella faccia?<eos> I think he wants to see you.<eos> You know, studies have shown that babies begin exhibiting cognizable nonverbal communication within days of birth.<eos> And some things never change. Yeah.<eos> And some things do,
There's something else we need to talk about.<eos> Did she tell you she was withdrawing from school?<eos> She was?<eos> She got a B-plus on her midterm.<eos> She thought her world was over.<eos> Aasia, you never told me that.<eos> She picked up extra-credit work and she was going to withdraw her request on Monday.<eos> This, whatever's happening, it isn't related to that.<eos> I need you to believe me.<eos> I do.
They fit right in.<eos> As a couple, were they combative?<eos> Affectionate?<eos> How much affection do you ever really see for couples who are married so long?<eos> There's a reason I'm not getting hitched, Detective.<eos> Because you can't legally marry your own reflection?<eos> Burn.<eos> Your real estate agent caught the man who killed Taylor going through your drawers at your open house.<eos> Seems weird, doesn't it?<eos> Yes, it does.
Take it away!<eos> - Hey, Kermit. Two things you need to know.<eos> - Hmm? I cannot work late tonight.<eos> I got to dump this possum I've been seeing.<eos> He's disgusting... not 'cause he's a possum.<eos> Because he's in advertising.<eos> Yeah, well, I hope the second thing I need to know is something I need to know.<eos> Yeah, Fozzie asked me to remind you to read the sketch he wrote for the show.<eos> I already read it.<eos> I did, too.
No! - Yeah, I have Yolanda, okay?<eos> Huh? You de Yolandee?<eos> Yo de Yolandee.<eos> Oh, now the guy with the funny accent has Yolanda?<eos> - H-unh! - I have Yolanda.<eos> I got her slippers with headlights so she can have her midnight snack in safety.<eos> Okay, wait a minute.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Okay, raise your hand if you have Yolanda.<eos> I did.
Or have you decided you want to be part of your own relationship?<eos> Oh, no. I'm not getting her anything.<eos> She said she didn't want a gift.<eos> - Oh, is that what she said?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hmm. Let me look that up in my lady translator.<eos> - What? - Boop-boop-boop-boop.<eos> Ah, look at that..<eos> She wants a gift.<eos> - She does?
That would be thoughtful.<eos> Girls are always asking if they look fat.<eos> With a scale, they can know for sure.<eos> Ooh! Here's a thoughtful gift.<eos> Last month, Denise had bronchitis, and she never picked up her prescription.<eos> Chip, just close the laptop.<eos> But then I don't know what to do with my eyes.<eos> Well, what about a bag of socks?<eos> They're cheap, and if she hates them and throws them at you, it's not gonna hurt...<eos> - Like that scale did.
Let's get this show on the road.<eos> (Floyd) There's a lot of Tic Tacs and Funyuns on the floor back here.<eos> (Janice) Oh, for sure.<eos> (Animal) Van go faster!<eos> Faster!<eos> Faster!<eos> - [Chuckles] - Oh, I love it!<eos> Oh, Kermit!<eos> Oh, and this jewelry box even smells like home.<eos> Oh, well, of course it does.
You can do it.<eos> Hi, Chelsea?<eos> I was in earlier, wearing the green jacket that's louder than that guy laughing at his own screenplay?<eos> She's laughing!<eos> I would like to take you out for coffee sometime, maybe at a place you don't have to make it?<eos> Great.<eos> O-okay, I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Bye.<eos> She said yes.<eos> Of course she did.
I thought...<eos> I have good news.<eos> Dembe made contact.<eos> You spoke to him?<eos> No, we have a protocol.<eos> He initiated it.<eos> We meet him later today.<eos> In the meantime, Aram gave me a name, a gunsmith who makes Wendigo's weapons.<eos> The feds don't know how to find him.<eos> But I do.
I'm so sorry, but I had nothing to do...<eos> You killed her!<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> It's understandable that you would think she did, but she didn't.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Take it down, Blair, before more innocent people die.<eos> My mom was innocent.<eos> I lost my mom when I was a little girl.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> You don't.
Call your boss.<eos> Tell him the FBI needs to talk with Crispin Crandall.<eos> What the hell is this place?<eos> We're not gonna wait to find out.<eos> I want to talk to Charlie Volkens.<eos> You got any idea where you are, sport?<eos> You know what we do here?<eos> Asher Sutton.<eos> He has nothing to do with this.<eos> Oh, yeah, he does.

All right.<eos> Fine.<eos> We're here to ask you a few questions about your relationships with Scott McCoy.<eos> Call our lawyers, honey.<eos> I will... right after I drag you down to the precinct.<eos> You can post a photo on Instagram.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> If you really had anything on us, you wouldn't be down here trying to see us naked.<eos> Oh, we've got something.<eos> Or... rather, one of you does.
If they ask about the video...<eos> Then they know we leaked it.<eos> - Did you leak it?<eos> - Of course we leaked it.<eos> You, personally, leaked the video?<eos> Well, not personally.<eos> That's the question.<eos> Did you leak a video of Ms. Locke?<eos> Did you?<eos> No, I did not.
And they have to make sure the only thing he broke was his vows, make sure there's no quid pro quo, that there's favoritism, that every cent the White House may have paid Olivia Pope was for the professional services she rendered<eos> So you're wrong.<eos> The one man, the only man in this country whom you can prosecute for sleeping around is Fitzgerald Grant.<eos> I don't want to be president.<eos> I know.<eos> I would make a terrible president.<eos> Which is precisely why you shouldn't quit.<eos> The people in this town who worry me sick, who make me fear for the survival of this democracy, are the ones who think they'd be great presidents.<eos> They are so loaded up on megadoses of hubris that they don't recognize that it's the most humbling job in the world.<eos> But you do.
They'll be here soon.<eos> What is it?<eos> Should we wait and meet him?<eos> I'm fucking starving.<eos> Should we wait for the main actor?<eos> That bastard.<eos> What's all this?<eos> I've got it.<eos> -I'll do it.<eos> -I'll do it.
Oh, my God!<eos> These are the most beautiful earrings I've ever seen.<eos> I picked them out.<eos> Happy housewarming/ Merry Christmas.<eos> You really shouldn't have done this.<eos> They look so expensive.<eos> They are.<eos> We just wanted to say we're sorry.<eos> We were way out of line to think we knew what was best for you.<eos> Even though we do.
Those Inquisitors are nasty business.<eos> Kanan, why didn't you tell us there were more of 'em?<eos> Commander Sato is going to need a full report on this.<eos> Well, we did get the medical supplies.<eos> Some of them. Well, that's good news.<eos> I'll meet you three on the command deck.<eos> Kanan, they knew about Ahsoka.<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> Did you know there was more than one?<eos> No, I didn't.
Your bodies will remember. Nice.<eos> Did you read the media release?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Something about... Sending them off to live happily ever after. Alone and in peace.<eos> And what's the nonfiction?<eos> Can't say, henry.<eos> No one wants this hot potato.<eos> They disappear, We all sleep easy.<eos> My agency had plans for them.<eos> Yeah, well, who didn't?
He's the son of Kurt Mitchell, the NIS agent who died protecting your wife and daughter.<eos> The NIS agent driving was hit with a head shot.<eos> Your wife and daughter died in the crash.<eos> Who Mitch is... not your concern.<eos> Look, I know you feel indebted to him.<eos> Don't you think we should turn this over to another team?<eos> What for?<eos> Because if things get sticky, you and I both know that you're gonna do whatever it takes to protect him.<eos> You think you know everything, DiNozzo.<eos> You don't.
How dare you?<eos> This is a complete violation of the anonymity we were promised at Utopia Circle.<eos> Utopia Circle won't exist if Tanya's convicted.<eos> Maybe she should be convicted.<eos> I mean, Dominic's dead because she pushed him too far.<eos> It's called "The Octopus"...<eos> Dominic's favorite position...<eos> mine, too... except Dominic also liked to get slapped in the face during it.<eos> Uh, how does this help Tanya's case?<eos> It doesn't.
Alicia.<eos> It wasn't an accident.<eos> - Of course it was.<eos> - No.<eos> You traded cards so you could have sex with Dominic that night.<eos> Why?<eos> So you could kill him.<eos> - That's ridiculous.<eos> - You think the prosecution doesn't have evidence against you?<eos> Neither did I until now.
And he's not getting any younger.<eos> I don't have anyone else.<eos> The way things are going, I don't see kids in my future, so...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Guess I'm searching for a sense of belonging.<eos> "Rita Applegate."<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Well, I should, uh, I should probably get back to work.<eos> Oh, so I see you got your problem with your Internet fixed?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Our frogmen did their dive, they found the motorcycle.<eos> We traced it to a visiting Serbian national.<eos> He and his brother were on a flight back to Serbia less than three hours after Harry Cole was shot.<eos> They've both got violent records back home.<eos> So we infiltrate a Serbian crime gang.<eos> It's almost too easy.<eos> I'm pushing the DA to extradite, but it's a long shot.<eos> I'm sure they were guns for hire.<eos> Enjoying some classic Calvin?<eos> Doing some homework.
Truth is...<eos> I don't know what's what.<eos> Please.<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> Really?<eos> I mean, really?<eos> You ever hear of privacy?<eos> Hey, you want privacy, close your door.<eos> Thought we talked about this.<eos> Yeah, we did, Dean.
Darn tootin'.<eos> But you've been great.<eos> I really appreciate all your hard work.<eos> And, uh...<eos> Sorry if I was a little tough on ya.<eos> You mean you treating me like a punching bag?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> I got baggage, too, Donna.<eos> Everyone does.
Whoa. Head rush.<eos> Ever think...<eos> About running away?<eos> From you?<eos> No way.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, from here.<eos> All this.<eos> The hunting life.<eos> Do you?
So only dead people get to see him?<eos> And this makes sense to billions of you?<eos> It is the nature of faith.<eos> It's -- it's all here.<eos> The mercy of God, his love the world and mankind, his -- his perfect plan for us.<eos> Manipulation.<eos> You only believe what he wants you to believe.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't know what he is like at all.<eos> We certainly do.
The chicken's come home to roost.<eos> This ghastly force set free when the Mark was removed.<eos> So you know.<eos> I've heard whispers.<eos> As bad as they say?<eos> Well, let's just say that everyone in this room might hold a piece of the puzzle to corking it back up.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> And what happens to me once the danger's past?<eos> How do I know I can trust any of you?<eos> You don't.
He's a minor.<eos> Since when did Hank Voight become such a stickler for the rules?<eos> Oh, so now you're taking the leash off?<eos> Is this coming from you or the superintendent?<eos> So I can tell people if it goes sideways.<eos> If this kid is a monster and we set him...<eos> Deputy, can I please just get back to doing my job?<eos> Please.<eos> Just tell me you have a handle on this.<eos> I don't, actually.
He volunteered at a juvenile detention center last year as a conditioning coach.<eos> Now, you throw a rock in there, you're gonna hit somebody willing ... to pull a trigger for that price.<eos> Find this guy.<eos> Ethan, um...<eos> I got to go, but your mom's on her way in.<eos> Okay?<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Sure.<eos> Does my mom need to know?<eos> Yeah, man. She does.
What did they say to you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You can tell me.<eos> If they were bullying you, it could help our case.<eos> They just said that I'm a slut.<eos> It's fine, and... it's kind of true.<eos> No, it's not fine.<eos> That's how people get in your head.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Actually, uh, I do.
Well, fixated I guess would be the word.<eos> - and he's on top of me.<eos> - On top of me.<eos> I tried to fight back, but I kept passing out.<eos> But I kept passing out.<eos> It felt like some horrible dream.<eos> These are children.<eos> It is my job to be an adult, and I take that job very seriously.<eos> Did you tell the school what happened?<eos> I did.
And it can't look like I'm stalling or stepping away from the negotiating table.<eos> I got that, too.<eos> So...<eos> What you need from me is... ?<eos> Time.<eos> I need you to stall.<eos> See, that right there, that's where I get lost.<eos> I've got zero, zippo, nada to do with these negotiations other than cheering them on from the sideline...<eos> If you were to let it slip that you had reservations about the treaty...<eos> But I don't.

What's that?<eos> Fear.<eos> Jake.<eos> Have you ever...<eos> lied to someone's face when your back was completely against the wall to get what you wanted?<eos> Have you ever looked someone in the eye and made them think you loved them?<eos> Really truly loved them so you could take whatever it is you needed from them?<eos> I believe him.<eos> My gut says he's telling the truth.<eos> Of course it does.
What the hell is this?<eos> So, here's the thing.<eos> This bill keeps the lights on, and I'm all for that, Just not when it means hurting people in the process.<eos> Mrs. Grant -- I have the floor.<eos> You say we're not defunding planned parenthood, And technically you're right.<eos> But by making that money discretionary, You give the people in this room the power to say,<eos> "you know what?<eos> We're a little over budget this year.<eos> How about we don't give that little ladies' organization The full amount they're asking for?"<eos> So you don't.
She did this part.<eos> I didn't have to.<eos> I didn't have to be everything.<eos> You could've had something...<eos> Been something.<eos> Mellie -- that's what she said.<eos> I hate that you're always right.<eos> Me too.<eos> We tried.<eos> We did.
You don't do that, unless you no longer want a career here.<eos> So I tried to think of why you would do that.<eos> And there was really only one good explanation.<eos> NZT is going to change the entire world, Rebecca.<eos> This division has to stay in front of it.<eos> And that's why I'm here?<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> I got this job a month after my father died.<eos> You must've made the connection.<eos> Sure, I did.
You saw the scans. You're a good surgeon.<eos> You knew this was hopeless.<eos> I wasn't hopeless.<eos> I don't know why you are.<eos> Because there's nothing here to save.<eos> What's the trickiest part of a partial nephrectomy?<eos> Well, I think it's essential that... not you...<eos> Blake. Mobilizing the colon quickly to get adequate exposure of the kidney.<eos> By your third year, you should know this surgery inside and out.<eos> I do.
The clergy. People put their trust in us... their faith.<eos> We break that trust, it stays broken.<eos> I can't believe that.<eos> [ Scoffs ] You know who you are.<eos> You can stand up to them and have faith in that...<eos> Have faith in yourself.<eos> I have to believe that.<eos> They say he doesn't give you more than you can handle. [ Chuckles ]<eos> You say that, actually. [ Chuckles ]<eos> Yes, I do.
I mean, then I could actually make something out of that.<eos> Yes! Look!<eos> Look! That's a fifth metacarpal head! Look!<eos> Right there!<eos> [ Chuckles ] That's a hand.<eos> That is what we needed.<eos> Under there, that's... That is a hand!<eos> We got a hand, people!<eos> I can't friggin' believe it.<eos> I did.
I have a daughter.<eos> Adele never told Lois or anyone about the affair.<eos> She never bashed me to her family.<eos> She lived with that pain and embarrassment for years...<eos> Alone.<eos> She protected me, and I'm ashamed of that.<eos> It was a mess.<eos> I made a mess.<eos> And for as much pain as I caused and felt, I would have never believed that anything good would have come of it.<eos> But it did.

That way.<eos> No way.<eos> What if it's a trap?<eos> It's not a trap, it's a beacon.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Following your tattoos got us here and got us shot at.<eos> The tattoos led to Guerrero.<eos> Why send us out here just to kill us?<eos> How'd they know we'd be in this exact spot at this exact moment - to see the derricks?<eos> - They didn't.
I'm the reigning two-time champ.<eos> It's a 12-team PPR league.<eos> 12-team PPR league.<eos> Well, before I, you know, before I...<eos> Booth quit because he thought it was a gateway to gambling, so...<eos> Oh, it looks like Angela got us access to Ross's league.<eos> That's gonna be tons of information we're gonna have to go through.<eos> Lots of transaction logs, e-mails; not to mention, all the trash talking on the message boards.<eos> Oh, I love a good trash talking.<eos> Of course you do.
I know more than I first told you.<eos> - About what?<eos> - Don't answer that.<eos> I know who killed Sam Keating.<eos> Do you have any idea what you just did?<eos> - Dad, just listen to me.<eos> - No, you just admitted that you knowingly withheld material evidence in an ongoing murder investigation.<eos> - Please, let me explain. - Shh!<eos> Quiet, quiet.<eos> Who did it, Asher?
Just keeping an eye on our guy Bruno.<eos> Well, stop.<eos> I talked to Nate, and he promised he was gonna look into him.<eos> And you think your cop buddy's - gonna handle this the right way?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And what does the "right way" mean?<eos> - I'll call you later.<eos> - They're dating?<eos> Michaela's pretty much the only other number he calls, but I don't think she knows who he is.<eos> But Wes does?
You're not gonna get me drunk and convince me to sign this deal.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't know who killed Sam Keating.<eos> Not for sure, at least.<eos> That was a stall tactic, a very smart one.<eos> I understand why you did it.<eos> This can't be an easy decision for you to make.<eos> Then don't make me make it.<eos> I wish I had that much power.<eos> You do.
Bonnie, Frank, in my office.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> I think you do.<eos> Okay, that's enough.<eos> Just tell us what Frank wanted from you that night, then we'll go.<eos> Frank called me that night, but only to use my storage locker, so I gave him the key.<eos> I don't see a way out of this.<eos> It's going to work.<eos> Asher's not going to testify.<eos> But what if he does?
I was told to speak with a man named Eli matchett.<eos> What are you, cops?<eos> Goons working for verdiant?<eos> Either way, I'm not telling you...<eos> The next one goes in your leg.<eos> Eli matchett.<eos> - He's gone.<eos> - Gone where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't.
Did he land on his feet?<eos> Unfortunately, no.<eos> Mugs had borrowed $500,000 from a loan shark against the value of the painting.<eos> When he didn't steal it, he couldn't pay it back.<eos> A few weeks later, the loan shark shot him dead.<eos> There's something going on with that vent.<eos> Time to go.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How did they find us?<eos> They didn't.
It's ingenious.<eos> Hire a mad man to unleash a catastrophic threat, and then wait just long enough for the world to panic.<eos> Why would we do that?<eos> For the money, Susan.<eos> So, you and your company could come rushing in with a new product at the perfect time.<eos> A seed immune to the devastating scourge, and available, of course, at a much higher price.<eos> You can't prove that.<eos> Oh, but I can.<eos> I know about the Genesis project.<eos> By now, so do the FBI.
- I don't know.<eos> He said he went to the first two, nothing came of 'em, so the third one kind of seemed pointless.<eos> Come on.<eos> No, I'm gonna call him. They need us upstairs, bro.<eos> What?<eos> You were engaged twice?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Before Wendy, there was Nicole.<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.
I'm asking so I can defend you.<eos> Yes.<eos> There's people that can vouch for it.<eos> What they didn't know is that he was beating me, because I covered up for him again and again.<eos> I just couldn't take it anymore.<eos> Why stage the crime scene?<eos> - I exaggerated it.<eos> - Why? Because I knew no one would believe me.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Because I do.
A reporter just called my cell, said she had questions about Tiffany.<eos> Did she say anything else, give any details?<eos> - No. - Phew.<eos> That's good.<eos> How is that good?<eos> Sinclair leaked this.<eos> She leaked a name to scare you.<eos> It means nothing.<eos> But you said you'd handle her.<eos> I did.
Her own brother even believes that she did it.<eos> You may not believe it, but I do, and I'm the expert, so you do what I say.<eos> Catherine's not here, though.<eos> - That's being taken care of.<eos> - Taken care of how?<eos> - You mean kill her?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> So Catherine ran over Sinclair here. That's our story.<eos> Our story doesn't matter.<eos> Of course it does.
We threw a party, everyone was drinking, a bunch of people went upstairs.<eos> Four guys took one girl upstairs, so don't you dare say you didn't know what they were going to do to her.<eos> I didn't, though.<eos> But later she said everyone saw her leave the house crying.<eos> Or were you so drunk you don't remember calling your dad and asking him to cover it all up?<eos> I called him because I was worried about her.<eos> - He decided to cover it up.<eos> - And you let him.<eos> And now she thinks about it every day, what you didn't do, while you get to live your life without even thinking about her.<eos> I do.
Are you prosecuting my client to cover up the fact that you are actually the man that drove Marco to suicide?<eos> - You were sleeping with his wife, which means that you are the "he"<eos> that Marco kept referring to in his 911 call.<eos> Isn't that right, Mr. Nelson?<eos> Are you not answering because you know that anything you say will prove prosecutorial misconduct...<eos> You'd be disbarred, or, worse, be sent to prison?<eos> I take the fifth.<eos> Mr. Nelson, I want to be sure<eos> - that you know what you're doing.<eos> - I do, your honor.
What does that have to do with me?<eos> The charges were made on the card I left at the bar.<eos> Did you come all the way down here to accuse me of stealing your card?<eos> Charges were very specific.<eos> You told me you loved staying at the Rose Garden Inn.<eos> Elijah, I returned your card to you.<eos> Why would I do that if I was gonna steal your money?<eos> Did you find any evidence that I made those purchases?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't do it, Elijah.
Haven't seen you for ages!<eos> Thought you might have eloped with someone!<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Good to know you're worried.<eos> Grandma has cooked a lot.<eos> Let's eat at home, alright?<eos> Please...<eos> Alright.<eos> Does Grandma remember my name or not?<eos> Yes, she does.
Thought you might have eloped with someone!<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Good to know you're worried.<eos> Grandma has cooked a lot.<eos> Let's eat at home, alright?<eos> Please...<eos> Alright.<eos> Does Grandma remember my name or not?<eos> Yes, she does.<eos> She definitely does!
Football. Get him!<eos> Get him! JANICE FRONING:<eos> Na, na, na, na. JANICE FRONING: Climbing whatever<eos> [Motor revving]<eos> [Laughing]<eos> He was always very active, very active kid.<eos> Probably had a touch of ADHD, but, uh,<eos> Just had to channel that. He was always in sports.<eos> So he was always very structured. Kept him busy doing things around the house... either that,<eos> Or doing sports.
Sir, you were right about the scarlet macaw.<eos> They are very hard to find.<eos> When you can find one, they're real pricey.<eos> However, a private zoo outside of St. Augustine reported a macaw stolen.<eos> The owner suspected it to be a former employee, but they didn't have any proof.<eos> I checked out this former employee,<eos> Bobby Boles, Bobby being short for Robert,<eos> Robert maybe being our mad scientist.<eos> Did Robert Boles ever go to medical school?<eos> Yeah, he totally did.
Bart Johnson, lead on the job.<eos> Hey, Bart, know you're busy.<eos> Understatement.<eos> Just when we get power back up in Marigny and Bywater, lose it in Central City and the Garden District.<eos> Well, we have questions about the blackout.<eos> About time someone does.<eos> This was not an accident.<eos> Somebody cut the gate over there.<eos> Saw that.<eos> Did a hatchet job on the cables.
Another clamp.<eos> No, no, come on.<eos> Was it a bad call trying to resect?<eos> - No. - No.<eos> It was the right call, just a bold one.<eos> Yeah, this would have happened during his transplant surgery.<eos> Mm-hmm. Karev chose the right twin.<eos> Another clamp.<eos> Got it. You did it?<eos> You did it.
Thank God.<eos> Carol?<eos> Who is this?<eos> Your husband.<eos> - My husband?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He loves you, and he's gonna take you home.<eos> I'd rather go with you.<eos> I wouldn't know where to go.<eos> Tom does.
Elevator's not working.<eos> Tristan must have shut them down.<eos> He chained the stairwell, too, locked us out.<eos> There should be an emergency ladder inside the elevator shaft. It's not opening.<eos> Get the hydraulic spreader.<eos> I can try to hack the elevator, get in electronically.<eos> No, we don't have time for that.<eos> We're gonna get to Tristan the same way he got to Isabel-- over the Internet.<eos> Please, you don't want to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.
Please, you don't want to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> You deserve to die for what you did.<eos> You took her from me. RYAN:<eos> Tristan, listen to me.<eos> Isabel would not want this for you.<eos> Shut up!<eos> You don't know what she would have wanted!<eos> You didn't know her like I did!<eos> No one did. RYAN:
Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God, please, please.<eos> Please, please, please.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> - No! - Whoa.<eos> Hey.<eos> Oh, we had sex?<eos> We had sex.<eos> Yeah, we had so much sex.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Well, you won't believe what he asked me to do about it.<eos> This is their lives, Will.<eos> Mine, too.<eos> And I won't throw that away.<eos> You think this is just a job to me? A fancy office?<eos> Blomfeld showed up at Wally's.<eos> Dash was there.<eos> How?<eos> - How did he find him?<eos> - He didn't.
- I hope so. - For all of our sakes.<eos> - Well, you can see where the label "twisted" will precede "genius" in your obituary.<eos> Um, if you're recommending a publicist, I'm all ears.<eos> What's gonna happen to her?<eos> The viral vector that landed on her skin will change her pigment first. Carcinoma.<eos> Then deeper tissues.<eos> Her immune system will do the rest.<eos> Biology is so deliciously messy.<eos> How do we stop it?<eos> You don't.
You're not moving in, sis.<eos> Well, perhaps I'm slightly premature, but in an hour, you'll both be dead, then everything that's yours... will be mine.<eos> And, of course, I get the baby. No.<eos> You see, our child deserves her best chance.<eos> And that's not with you.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> The withered knob of that sad old man.<eos> Uh, if memory serves, the last time you tried to use it, you weren't powerful enough to make it work.<eos> If my memory serves... last time, I didn't believe in myself.<eos> But now I do, as does everyone in this town.
I suppose I could get used to it.<eos> Don't go.<eos> I have to. Wait.<eos> Ginny.<eos> You should have turned yourself in when you had the chance, Ray. Wow.<eos> Come on, Detective.<eos> We both know you got nothing.<eos> Monica didn't talk.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> She didn't.
I threw them out.<eos> I figured it was time for some big changes.<eos> I was hoping you were into making a whole new start.<eos> I am.<eos> Honey, I... apologize from the bottom of my heart... for everything that I've put you through.<eos> If we're gonna give this any kind of a shot, we can't stay here.<eos> We leave everything behind, make a clean break.<eos> I want to.<eos> And I want to believe you.<eos> Please do.
I play a good villain.<eos> I mean, pay-per-view sales went up 18% the first half hour after the weigh-in.<eos> Okay, so you're saying there was no hard feelings afterwards?<eos> I'm not saying that. But when we left that arena, any feelings that I had-- they stayed there.<eos> - Okay. - What about, uh, the rest of your folks?<eos> Can you account for them?<eos> You're wasting your time. Look, nobody on my team would let some thin-skinned ex-con or his wide-eyed little brother get in the way of a $50 million payout against Manny Garcia next year.<eos> We're way too smart for that.<eos> You're acting like the kid doesn't stand a chance.<eos> He doesn't.
How much I admired their love for one another? Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, what I didn't tell you was how things started out between them.<eos> The day after their wedding, my grandfather was drafted into the Japanese navy and spent the next three years on a ship while my grandmother waited without any word from him.<eos> And neither of them ever stopped believing they would be together.<eos> And you know the rest.<eos> They were married for 60 years, had five children, plenty of grandchildren.<eos> I want the same for us, Kono.<eos> You just have to believe.<eos> I do.
Luke, come on, baby.<eos> This is for the championship.<eos> Get up, baby.<eos> You can do it. Four!<eos> Devon Haynes is mocking the crowd<eos> - with his version of the hula dance.<eos> - Five! It's this type of brazen behavior that fans here were hoping Luke Nakano would put to an end tonight. Six!<eos> Nakano is back up on his feet!<eos> The referee checks him to see if he wants to continue.<eos> He does.
The more I thought about it, the angrier I got.<eos> I tracked him down and confronted him.<eos> I wanted to hear him acknowledge what he was responsible for.<eos> Did he?<eos> He started crying.<eos> Said he... promised to make things right.<eos> Things can't ever be made right.<eos> That's when you hit him.<eos> I thought it would make me feel better.<eos> But it didn't.
Big time.<eos> So Meyers had a joint account with his sister.<eos> Every month, same deposits, same expenses. Until September 18, 2013.<eos> There was $15,000 deposited into the account.<eos> That's the day after the Camden came back into port, when Meyers was taken into custody.<eos> What happened to the money?<eos> Three days later, the money was wired to a law firm called Whitford and Roe.<eos> They're, like, bigwigs out of Norfolk.<eos> I thought Meyers had a JAG attorney handle his case.<eos> He did.
- "Gonorrhea."<eos> - Easy.<eos> Guess you better hope that Joel doesn't go tell her.<eos> Fuck's sake, man.<eos> So, Milo, this boat dude, is he, like, a good buddy or what?<eos> Not really.<eos> To be honest, most of them down here are total cunts.<eos> The place attracts them.<eos> Then why'd he lend you the boat?<eos> He didn't.
If you're gonna do it, you do it.<eos> - Could you not talk about that, please?<eos> - For, like, the next 45 minutes?<eos> What else should we talk about?<eos> How about how Joel is still in love with Helena?<eos> Why do you keep bringing her up?<eos> I don't need to listen to this, and thank you for including me, but I don't want any part of your villa.<eos> - You don't want it? - No.<eos> No.<eos> Of course you don't.
Well, you know, it's a work trip, so. You still haven't said why you're in town.<eos> Hovercraft conference?<eos> Invisibility cloak expo?<eos> Oh, so close, but, you know, I don't work for Hogwarts anymore.<eos> I work for DARPA, and pretty much everything I do is, you know... Compartmented, yes.<eos> No work.<eos> So, just to get small talk out of the way:<eos> let's see, your dad is, uh, on a low salt diet, your aunt's become a lesbian, and the dog is eating his own poop. Hello.<eos> I have baggage.<eos> Yes, we do.
- RJ quit a few weeks ago, after his dad tried to choke Coach.<eos> Who chokes someone at basketball practice?<eos> Well, Latrell Sprewell does.<eos> - A Knick, wasn't he?<eos> - Not at the time.<eos> So?<eos> You guys going to arrest this dude or what?<eos> Hey, we'll talk to RJ's dad.<eos> Does Washington have the death penalty?<eos> - It does.
We can watch Hoosiers.<eos> After all these years?<eos> You've always refused before.<eos> Well, back then, I was worried that seeing you cry over fictional sports would adversely affect my sexual desire for you.<eos> But that's not an issue anymore, friend.<eos> - Your tire's on my lawn, man.<eos> - Bill me.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> I know my alibi checked out.<eos> - Yeah, it did.
The senator is in critical condition after the assassination attempt.<eos> Police have the assailant in custody.<eos> His name is Dr. Lionel Gray, a genetic scientist at Seoul National University...<eos> This is what we're dealing with now?<eos> Decentralized cells.<eos> We have a tonnage issue with insanity in this country.<eos> And genius insanity, which is a dangerous combination.<eos> Attacking with a genetic slime that modifies cells, turning facial skin pigments into a hideous death mask.<eos> You know Memento Mori is going to try to top this. Even though Gray is in custody.<eos> I do.
I'm not sentimental in that way. And Arthur's kept my identities fresh.<eos> Yeah, but you left DNA.<eos> I'm sure Blomfeld sequenced it already for predictive facial recognition.<eos> You all need to leave the city now.<eos> This may be the only time you ever hear this, Vega.<eos> But I couldn't agree with you more.<eos> I need to get to my apartment.<eos> No, it's too risky.<eos> Blomfeld has the weight and reach of D.I.A. behind him.<eos> Unless he doesn't.
I'm just so grateful you're okay.<eos> Is that Boden and Brett in the hallway?<eos> Yeah, but you don't have to...<eos> They can come in.<eos> Okay.<eos> How is she?<eos> I, uh... think she's still in shock.<eos> Well, she's been through a lot.<eos> She needs time to process everything.<eos> You both do.
No cake equals hate. Okay, this is bad.<eos> I haven't seen this many angry gay people since that NBC "Peter Pan."<eos> There they are.<eos> That's the one that refused to sell me cupcakes.<eos> Oh! Hey, all right, come on now.<eos> The one with the bee-stung lips, or the one with the unfortunate side bang?<eos> This is just a misunderstanding.<eos> Max's Homemade Cupcakes is pro-gay.<eos> - I love gay people.<eos> - She does.
That is a wild guess.<eos> Or not a guess at all.<eos> I ran a handwriting analysis and it's a perfect match.<eos> She's bluffing.<eos> She couldn't have had time to run that test.<eos> That... and we found a partial print, which confirms that you're part of the ring.<eos> There's no way you have a print.<eos> I-I've never seen that book before.<eos> I didn't think we had a print for Olivia.<eos> We don't.
Walter's got a class to teach, and, Toby, you've got a job interview coming up.<eos> You heard her.<eos> Let's get to it.<eos> ♪ We gonna step up in the booth like it's the first time... ♪ I'm here.<eos> These are the guys who ruined the elastic in my underwear growing up.<eos> Play the part and go find that device.<eos> Hello. My name is Sam Paley.<eos> I am a transfer student looking to try out for the wrestling team.<eos> My JC coach should've called you to let you know that I'd be coming by.<eos> Yeah, he totally did, bro.
- Nothing?<eos> I got a surfboard today.<eos> But nothing about you and Tandy going to a park to try to get his sperm to fertilize your egg?<eos> I mean, you told me it was just about having sex.<eos> Todd, you have to understand the circumstances.<eos> I feel like I'm gonna be sick out of both ends.<eos> I mean, you can have a baby with a guy that you've known for, like, three days, but you can't have a baby with the man you love?<eos> Look, I came to my senses.<eos> I changed my mind. You don't just change your mind about having a baby.<eos> I did.
- OK.<eos> He said she's being held under the NDAA.<eos> That allows for indefinite detention of an American citizen without due process, so she has no lawyer, she's probably being held at a military base.<eos> I'm gonna call DC, see if I can get some answers.<eos> Or we can just use this.<eos> At first Johnson's just gonna assume he lost it, so let's see what we can find out before he shuts it down.<eos> Fine, but not here.<eos> You need to lie low.<eos> You know, Naz told me to go to the safe house.<eos> - She did?
Johnson's been asking.<eos> Someone stole Johnson's cellphone, sent out a bunch of text messages saying he has a micropenis.<eos> Sound like someone we know?<eos> Well, I'm not saying he's the most mature person in the world or your average third-grade classroom for that matter.<eos> But he is committed to getting Naz back.<eos> We need you to talk to Johnson.<eos> We need proof that someone in the FBI signed off on abducting Brian for that black op.<eos> Consider this your carrot.<eos> Tell Johnson it contains Brian's complete medical file.<eos> - Does it?
GAM is always losing to the Wong Sa.<eos> - That must be where Mitra is, right?<eos> - Thanks, Pradeep. No worries.<eos> Be happy.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - [LAUGHS] We have a ship! - It's a start<eos> [KNOCKING]<eos> Agent Boyle, what have you got?<eos> Found anything worth reporting?<eos> Sir, I did, actually.
Okay, Alex, listen to me.<eos> She is gone.<eos> You can't bring her back, but you can save lives by ending this war.<eos> The only reason you're breathing... is because you're no good to me dead.<eos> Stop!<eos> Wait, wait, wait! Wait!<eos> Reaper, don't do this.<eos> Yo, you better stay out the way.<eos> They killed Imani! No.<eos> No, they didn't.

Osteosarcoma.<eos> It involves the frontal and the occipital bone.<eos> It's locally very aggressive.<eos> It's a lovely tumor.<eos> It's almost cute.<eos> Just plopped there.<eos> "Hello."<eos> He's waited 18 months for this kidney.<eos> We finally have one, and now he has cancer?<eos> - What if he didn't?

It's pretty high-profile stuff for a secret agent who's supposed to be dead...<eos> Gleason?<eos> He's so badass.<eos> It's all in connection with Ambassador Madaky, who has been charged with the murder of an MI6 agent inside the UN General Assembly building.<eos> Hey-hey, Ray!<eos> Hey, Wally!<eos> You guys are on the TV.<eos> Well, kind of.<eos> They didn't mention you.<eos> They rarely do.
I can't.<eos> We have a housewarming thing tonight, for Jane.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks for getting that list back.<eos> Oh, glad I could help.<eos> He's got a few walls that may never come down... and is maybe the most introverted person I've ever met, but aside from that, you won't find a better man.<eos> We should probably take those rings off.<eos> Right, heh.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> Yes... I do.
- They know you came to me?<eos> This is my sergeant.<eos> Dominic, they know?<eos> They know you came to me?<eos> - Yeah, well, it didn't help that you went poking around a Pentagon contractor.<eos> This is bad.<eos> NSA thinks I'm some kind of rogue agent.<eos> Like I've got an agenda to embarrass the government.<eos> - So, do you have an agenda i need to know about?<eos> - No, I don't.
All right, look, I know I need to show Mike and Ike more respect, but I'm trying to do that.<eos> When are you gonna start respecting me?<eos> When I'm on NZT, I can read a situation better than anyone in the room, okay?<eos> I can think through all the different angles, every perspective.<eos> Then shouldn't you have known mine?<eos> How and when I'm trained to use lethal force, that I was gonna shoot Casey?<eos> You texted me.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> I didn't think you'd shoot him.<eos> But I did.
Like smoke filtration masks.<eos> Okay, kids, this will only be a second.<eos> This is insanity!<eos> The second I rebuild a code bridge, the worm corrupts it behind me.<eos> I'm really starting to doubt that you are the right man for this job.<eos> Oh, you think you can handle it?<eos> - What age did you win the coding Olympics?<eos> - Okay, enough!<eos> Walter, you told me to trust you.<eos> I do.
In exchange for my bone marrow, I want my life sentence reduced to time served.<eos> I want to walk out of here a free man.<eos> Open up.<eos> I knew Sean was mixed up in something.<eos> But I never imagined this.<eos> He went to the FBI.<eos> He was trying to do the right thing.<eos> And it got him shot.<eos> Do you have children, Agent Gibbs?<eos> I did.
Ellie's a lot like her father.<eos> They're very direct.<eos> They're both intellectuals, and they're reserved.<eos> And don't forget stubborn.<eos> You know, a perfect example was her fourth birthday.<eos> She decided it was time to take those training wheels off her bike.<eos> So the training wheels came off.<eos> Yeah, Ell barely made it down the driveway before she toppled over.<eos> Thought for sure she was gonna cry.<eos> But she didn't.
We need to leave.<eos> - Clive.<eos> - There you are.<eos> I got a lead on our second mugger.<eos> Carlos Rena is a diabetic.<eos> If he's hiding from Mr. Boss, he can't go home to retrieve his medication.<eos> I found a cousin who's a registered nurse.<eos> I sent a car to his house in case Carlos tries to get his insulin there.<eos> I'm afraid we have more dangerous fish to fry.<eos> We do?
Call the police.<eos> I'll tie these guys up.<eos> Whatever you are, I don't want you coming after me.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I have a favor to ask.<eos> Anything.<eos> If this doesn't work...<eos> If the cure doesn't happen...<eos> - It's going to.<eos> - But if it doesn't...
That's -- that's quite a name.<eos> Well, i am quite a girl.<eos> They weren't coming to save you. They were coming to kill you.<eos> You want to live?<eos> Tell me how they found you.<eos> So, where are we going?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry, char.<eos> I wish i had a plan.<eos> I don't.
Your real name.<eos> Kenneth.<eos> Now look what you've done.<eos> You spilled all the tea, dear.<eos> You have to tell me your real name.<eos> They're gonna hurt me if you don't.<eos> You like getting hurt, jilly.<eos> You wouldn't be here with them if you didn't.<eos> You think so?<eos> I do.
What's wrong with him?<eos> Outside of the usual stuff?<eos> I'd say probably head trauma.<eos> Look.<eos> I think it's great that Glenn is making new friends, but, I've been over this before, the spark is gone and so am I.<eos> Mrs. Glenn, I know you've got reason to doubt him, but...<eos> Today, your husband has pulled a calf muscle, done time, picked up out-of-the-way dry cleaning, put together a four, may be a five serviceable romantic speeches, babysat a self-entitled karate champ.<eos> My mother's waiting.<eos> He-he bounced off a bus for you.<eos> - No, he didn't.
He-he bounced off a bus for you.<eos> - No, he didn't.<eos> - Yes, he did. He did all that stuff.<eos> For you.<eos> You may think that you want a more glamorous life, you know, one with voice mails and a new car, but don't be so quick to throw away what you already have.<eos> 'Cause what you already have has been fighting for you all day.<eos> And if you have someone in your life that knows you're worth fighting for, then you're right, that's not a spark.<eos> Mrs. Glenn, that's a fire.<eos> H- how do I know he'll change?<eos> You don't.
I can't say I've done much.<eos> Until drugs corrupted the hell out of it, it was a great sport.<eos> You want to know why?<eos> It's one of the few sports that focuses on a team of individuals.<eos> You see, the cyclist needs the rest of his team to get out in front, provide a wake, so he can draft on them.<eos> I'm not sure I follow.<eos> You want Squad Three to be the best squad in the city, right?<eos> I do.<eos> And you have an idea, a vision, on how to make that happen, I assume?<eos> Of course you do.
Pending my discretion.<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> Mm, you can call, but he won't budge.<eos> Does he know about South Sudan?<eos> Does he know about your missing friend?<eos> We want Ryan found, but right now, you're in no condition.<eos> You forget about South Sudan, mister.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> Abby...<eos> Don't "Abby" me.
I owe you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> We're good.<eos> Why do I concern myself with the health of someone who does not even bother to lock his door?<eos> Well, then quit concerning yourself.<eos> Ensign Ryan sends her undying gratitude.<eos> And I put a replacement steak in your fridge.<eos> Nice New York strip, actually.<eos> Didn't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, I kind of did.
Afraid it's on hold for the rest of us.<eos> Hey, that's fine by me.<eos> I'd rather catch a killer than eat a bird, anyway.<eos> Where's Christopher?<eos> Simple question.<eos> Kitchen, courtyard, traffic?<eos> He was with you at the crime scene, right?<eos> I know, but I don't know.<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> I really don't.
Damage consistent with that of another gunshot.<eos> Must have been a through and through.<eos> The exit wound would have been extremely close to the ilium.<eos> Have Hodgins swab it.<eos> It may provide clues to the actual murder site.<eos> Hey, I just got off the phone with Sebastian Kohl, who said he left some stuff on my porch because he was in the area.<eos> Who's Sebastian?<eos> Uh, shouldn't you be working?<eos> He's a gorgeous, smart, very successful photographer who does not live anywhere near me.<eos> However, Cam does.
It's what IA can prove.<eos> Drop everything and get Detective Deeks out of this mess.<eos> Francis Boyle was an LAPD veteran of 19 years and Detective Third Class when Deeks was assigned to him as a partner.<eos> He's got a lot of reprimands and complaints in his file.<eos> Well, he came through to him the department at a time when accountability wasn't considered important.<eos> This is Boyle's former partner, Detective Bruce Steadman.<eos> He's still on the force.<eos> His docket isn't much better.<eos> The police department split them up, hoping it would reduce the problem.<eos> It didn't.
I'd settle for an espresso.<eos> It's just been such a long night.<eos> It has been a long night.<eos> And yet you still haven't asked for a lawyer.<eos> Why is that?<eos> That's because I am a lawyer.<eos> I'm sure that's also in my file.<eos> Do you want to know what I think?<eos> Not particularly.<eos> Of course you do.
Really?<eos> Is that all you got left, Deeks?<eos> You're about as defiant as my eight-year-old. Wow.<eos> You have kids?<eos> Whew. Did not see that coming, Mommie Dearest.<eos> Hey, uh, quick question-- are we sure this coffee was made this week?<eos> We found new DNA evidence that places you in the hotel room where Boyle was killed.<eos> Well, that makes sense, since I stayed there for a week while my house was being tented.<eos> We can play this however you want, but you're not going anywhere until you tell me why you killed Boyle.<eos> I didn't. Then who did?
When Larson burned up in the Wood Street fire,<eos> Riddle started throwing his own guys under the bus before Larson was even cold.<eos> Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61.<eos> Man in distress, 9178 South Poplar Avenue.<eos> Victim's unconscious on the roof.<eos> Help the ladies get the stair chair up there.<eos> This cable's not letting his lungs expand.<eos> - Capp!<eos> Cut it off him.<eos> - Done.
Would you please stop?<eos> I have everything to worry about, Carter.<eos> This is a huge deal.<eos> You are too young to be doing any of this.<eos> So Jared is the guy that you're throwing these underground parties with?<eos> - Where did you hear that?<eos> - Officer Lopez.<eos> Old cop friend of mine.<eos> He said that you two met.<eos> Yeah, we did.
I thought she could move in with us.<eos> Olivia.<eos> Yeah, she's actually a really sweet girl and she's doing much better now.<eos> I'm sure she is, but...<eos> I just can't do that.<eos> Right.<eos> This is why I don't ask people for help.<eos> Ben, I'm sorry, I...<eos> It's okay, I can figure it out.<eos> I always do.
The blackout could be the Chernobyl of the power grid.<eos> Okay, I know that we can't divulge stuff, but I didn't know we'd moved on to spinning each other.<eos> I'm just giving you what the White House's official position is.<eos> Okay, let's try this:<eos> If it was us, was it in response to what happened on Air Force One?<eos> Solar flares happened on Air Force One.<eos> I was read in to that one.<eos> I know about the malware.<eos> Well... but not who was behind it, because we didn't know.<eos> And we do now?
Just keep your head down and your mouth shut.<eos> For God's sake, just do what we tell you to do.<eos> Well, whoever she is,<eos> I hope she fed you.<eos> We finished off the Kung Pao chicken.<eos> She was an endless seminar on the Sino-Soviet split and its effect on the end of the Cold War, which is ironic given the day's headlines.<eos> Might be a spring roll or two left.<eos> You could have that.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> No, we really don't.
I don't think...<eos> It's the least I can do.<eos> Your mother has taken care of this house and us for 30 years, and now the place is basically empty.<eos> I know, that's very generous, but...<eos> I think there may have just been a misunderstanding here. I'm sorry.<eos> I don't want to upset anyone.<eos> It's just an offer, sweetheart. - I know.<eos> - You can take it or leave it.<eos> Right, and we really appreciate it.<eos> Yes, we do.
We can move back out here. We can work for ourselves.<eos> No more crazy Stephanie.<eos> Yeah, but we'll have crazy Scotty instead.<eos> Well, I don't think we could do it with him.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> Not in the condition that he's in.<eos> And he's completely full of shit.<eos> He has nowhere near that kind of money.<eos> And we do?
Here's my question for you.<eos> Reason I got in touch.<eos> Whose money did she use to make that down payment?<eos> 'Cause if it's yours, you can just call the bank and void the check, right?<eos> No, we don't have a joint account.<eos> If she wrote a check, it's her money.<eos> What kind of married people don't share a fucking bank account?<eos> We're not married.<eos> I thought you had a kid together.<eos> We do.
How do you have a relationship with someone you can't trust?<eos> Well, I mean, it can't come as a total surprise, right?<eos> I mean, the relationship did start as an affair.<eos> So?<eos> So I'm just saying maybe we could've seen this coming.<eos> We have a child together.<eos> I know.<eos> You could always go back to Helen.<eos> She still loves you. I'm certain of that.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Are you fucking him again?<eos> I knew you'd ask that.<eos> - Well, are you?<eos> - No. No, I'm not.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> You have to trust me, Noah.<eos> I want to do this for myself.<eos> I don't want to be a doctor.<eos> No?<eos> You don't?
Nothing.<eos> Just came down to see how you're doing.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Mmm. What you working on?<eos> Well, I confirmed Baltimore Forensic's finding.<eos> The DNA on the needle does belong to Joy Vanatter.<eos> And then I ran the residue from inside the barrel through Major Mass Spec, and it's black tar heroin.<eos> It's a very cheap low-grade form of the narcotic.<eos> That's weird, 'cause Cheech said that Vanatter was using, um, high-grade heroin.<eos> He did.
Um, but I'm gonna be working late.<eos> All right, we'll play it by ear then. Okay.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Charming place.<eos> McGarrett brought the concept of rendition over from the military.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Our interrogation tactics, however unorthodox, do yield immediate results.<eos> Huh, where's the interrogator sit?<eos> We don't.
No, no, you won't talk to her.<eos> You're never even gonna meet her. It's Max, by the way. Oh.<eos> Max.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> What?<eos> Max just said the pawn shop owner died four hours before Katie Dawson.<eos> Doesn't make sense.<eos> If Kaelani already had the camera, why would he go back and kill Katie?<eos> He didn't. He didn't.
Is it cool if I drop off Roscoe an hour early this Friday?<eos> Sure.<eos> Candace and I are going out to celebrate the anniversary of our first date.<eos> Great.<eos> I got us a room at the Wine Country Inn.<eos> Nice.<eos> It's a package deal.<eos> Champagne brunch, couple's massage in the room.<eos> Don't care, Baxter.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Wow. Hey, guy?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Can we take a moment of silence to appreciate the awesomeness that's happening right behind that screen?<eos> Yeah, guy, we can.<eos> But we still don't know Groller's motivation.<eos> His field office did confirm that he had gone dark.<eos> Which means, for the time being, we're left with Wayne Morris.<eos> And Sam said that Morris is the one that is financially and logistically responsible for kidnapping Jada and getting her to Sudan.<eos> Do we know where Morris is now?<eos> Yes, we do.
It's time to tell the truth.<eos> We're not out of the woods, but we're a whole lot closer to the tree line.<eos> Finding Serena Holmes was huge, and faced with criminal prosecution, she's had a lot to say about her relationship with Roger Maddox, about setting up Wallace Boden.<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> I mean, that's the case, isn't it?<eos> We're gonna use it to see if Maddox will plea.<eos> - Thank you. - Yeah.<eos> I'll update you as soon as I know anything.<eos> Some people may have doubted Chief Boden.<eos> None of us did.
You know what I love, Mr. Maddox?<eos> I love the sound of a bird singing.<eos> Know what I mean?<eos> In the morning, you first wake up, and there is this little tweedle-dee, tweedle-dee out your window.<eos> It just... it just warms you up inside.<eos> Serena Holmes.<eos> Serena Holmes is singing like a bird.<eos> She's telling us how you paid her to frame Wallace Boden, how you stowed her away at a fancy inn at Lake Carlyle, how you told her to stay hidden until you can get her out of the country.<eos> That sounds like the delusions of a woman with an axe to grind.<eos> No, sir, it doesn't.
- Are you finished?<eos> - Yeah. 'Cause there's a man up in that house that needs our help right now.<eos> And if we don't focus, we're gonna be digging another hole right next to this one. Okay?<eos> So shut your frickin' turd hole and grab your dead buddy's legs.<eos> Come on!<eos> Oh, this frickin' reeks!<eos> Take a shower, dude.<eos> Gail.<eos> Todd and I have something that Todd wants to tell you.<eos> - I do?
Nope.<eos> Better.<eos> Okay, you guys are kind of freaking me out with the "cat that ate the canary" looks.<eos> What's better than corruption?<eos> Try murdering Russia's beloved president.<eos> Murder?<eos> A-As in... murder?<eos> Pavel Ostrov<eos> - had an embolism.<eos> - He did.
W-Well, the truth is, I don't know how it got there.<eos> Come on.<eos> Pride, I'm telling you.<eos> I-I was driving around friends all night.<eos> I'm the only one with a car.<eos> Okay.<eos> So someone else left the backpack in your car.<eos> Who?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't.
We'll let you all know.<eos> In the meantime, the mayor's right.<eos> We all just need to remain calm.<eos> Oh, baloney!<eos> If it was a werewolf, you need to stop screwing with us and let us know!<eos> Do I have to close my bar? !<eos> What about my market?<eos> Yeah, what about my BB? (all clamoring)<eos> Y'all know me.<eos> (Man) No, we don't.

(all clamoring)<eos> Y'all know me.<eos> (Man) No, we don't.<eos> Okay, you don't.<eos> Just got to town this morning.<eos> But y'all know how I earn a living.<eos> (Man) No, we don't.
You haven't told her about any of this?<eos> Or even that we've spoken? No.<eos> You asked me not to and I haven't.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I can't...<eos> I'm just not ready to see you two...<eos> Yes. I gathered that when you didn't come to the wedding.<eos> I understand, but... she misses you.<eos> For the life of me, I can't figure out why.<eos> But she does.
Because by the time they get to that point, um... it's gonna be a matter of arguing for a few of them probably.<eos> I think most of them will probably have already decided.<eos> So we want to get 'em early.<eos> Just get 'em thinking that there's another side to this they have not heard.<eos> All they've been hearing, for what, 15 months, is, you know, Teresa Halbach was burned.<eos> Bones were found on Steven Avery's property.<eos> Which is a horrible fact.<eos> But what they don't know is that there's evidence those bones were moved.<eos> And so...<eos> And neither does the media.
- And how was that done?<eos> My daughter Nikole brought her cell phone along and we...<eos> I should back up.<eos> Ryan gave us a direct line to Sheriff Pagel in case we found something.<eos> So I called Sheriff Pagel.<eos> And I said, "I think I found the vehicle."<eos> [Kratz] How long from when you entered that property did it take you to find Teresa's vehicle?<eos> I believed we entered at ten to ten... and by 10:20 to 10:25, we had found the vehicle.<eos> Ms. Sturm, do you know how many vehicles are on this property?<eos> I didn't at the time.
In order to remove any residual DNA that might have been on the bullet, I washed it.<eos> I put it in a test tube and washed it with some buffer that we use to extract the DNA.<eos> And the liquid is what I performed the rest of my procedure on.<eos> And were you able to develop a DNA profile from that washing - on item FL, the bullet?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty whether Teresa Halbach is the source of the DNA on item FL, the bullet?<eos> Yes.<eos> I believe she is the source of the DNA on the bullet.<eos> let me ask you, did this match differ in any way from the previous matches that you culled?<eos> Yes, it did.
Like Mr. Fassbender asked.<eos> - There were reasons why...<eos> - I'll get to that.<eos> My point is this:<eos> this is the only time in your entire career you have ever filed a deviation of protocol so that you could make a call and include somebody, isn't it?<eos> The deviation that I requested was appropriate for this situation.<eos> - It was OK'd and it was reported.<eos> - But, ma'am... you did not disclose in that report, that official report, that courts and juries and judges and lawyers and everybody else relies on, you did not disclose that in order to make that call,<eos> you had to do something so rare, you've never done it before, did you?<eos> No, I did not.
No.<eos> You tested many knives that were sent to you, right? - Yes.<eos> - I see at least seven - just in the May 8th report.<eos> Right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No DNA of Teresa Halbach's.<eos> - Correct.<eos> By the way... in all of this evidence that you've tested, all of it, did you ever find any DNA of a gentleman named Brendan Dassey anywhere?<eos> - In all of your tests?<eos> - No, I did not.
- Yes.<eos> - No DNA of Teresa Halbach's.<eos> - Correct.<eos> By the way... in all of this evidence that you've tested, all of it, did you ever find any DNA of a gentleman named Brendan Dassey anywhere?<eos> - In all of your tests?<eos> - No, I did not.<eos> Not one shred, right?<eos> - No, I did not find his DNA.<eos> - And you had his profile.<eos> Yes, I did.
I went to my trailer, then I went to the woods hunting.<eos> [Kratz] About what time was it you got out into the woods?<eos> [Tadych] About 3:00.<eos> On your way to deer hunting, that would be just before 3:00 p.m.,<eos> - did you observe anybody on the roadway?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> I saw Bobby Dassey on highway 147.<eos> I was going west and he was going east.<eos> Later that night, did you return to the Janda property?<eos> - Yes, I did.
- How about on November 8?<eos> Do you know whether Mr. Colborn took all of the stuff out of the bookcase?<eos> All the magazines and the photos and that type of thing were taken out of the bookcase.<eos> So that he could look in the bookcase.<eos> I suppose.<eos> And did you get a chance to look into the bookcase - when it was empty of its contents? - I may...<eos> I've glanced in there.<eos> I didn't really take a hard look in there, no, sir.<eos> You didn't see a blue lanyard and a black clasp and the Toyota key in that back of that bookcase, did you?<eos> No, sir, I did not.
- Correct.<eos> - Read the last sentence.<eos> "I started a log to document the names of individuals approaching the immediate area around the vehicle."<eos> - OK. "I started a log." Right?<eos> - Correct.<eos> Is there anyplace earlier in your report where you mention that you ever took any notes anywhere else about who was coming and going, other than this entry right here that it says it's 2:45 p.m.?<eos> No.<eos> My rough field notes, that's when I started previously.<eos> - Do you still have those?<eos> - No, I do not.
I was gonna raise fish.<eos> Me and Steve.<eos> That's why I put this building up.<eos> And I made those tanks, I made my own farms.<eos> I just wish that, you know, he could...<eos> [Strang] There's nowhere that Steven Avery will be able to go to get his reputation back if he wins this trial.<eos> He didn't commit the rape he did 18 years for.<eos> We know he didn't commit the rape he spent 18 years in prison for.<eos> Where did he get his reputation back for that?<eos> He didn't. He never did.
Is Scott doing that kind of thing?<eos> He's never seemed to me to be on Brendan's side.<eos> [Carla] Oh, he told Barbara.<eos> And Barbara said there's no way.<eos> Lead prosecutor Ken Kratz knows his job is only half done.<eos> Avery's co-defendant and nephew Brendan Dassey goes to trial on April 16th in Manitowoc County, that trial expected to last two weeks.<eos> So a victory for you with the change of venue, bringing the jury in from another county?<eos> I don't know if you want to call it a victory, but I think it's important that the jury be a fair jury, and I think this is a way to ensure that.<eos> When's the last time you talked to Brendan?<eos> Uh, we just did. No, I...
-To do the right thing?<eos> Yes.<eos> -And to tell your uncle not to do it?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -You made that up?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Mr. Dassey, didn't you tell your mother in a phone call on May 13th that you had gone over to your uncle Steven's after school -and before she came home?<eos> -Yes.<eos> And on May 15th, she's asking you why you didn't tell her.<eos> Why didn't you?
What is going on in the Wisconsin Department of Justice?<eos> I had gone from being one of the most respected das in the state to vilified and hated and altogether forgotten.<eos> There's a huge disconnect there.<eos> I mean, the judge did remove Kachinsky because he had allowed Brendan to talk to the police without him being there.<eos> But if he did that, he should also have suppressed the statement that was used to impeach Brendan.<eos> To recognize on the one hand that a lawyer is ineffective and then allow the fruits of that ineffectiveness to be used to the admission of another confession, I mean, it's a problem.<eos> It's a serious problem.<eos> Brendan tells me they treat him OK.<eos> I mean, he plays games with the other inmates.<eos> And he does his schooling.
Most excitedly.<eos> But you don't appear to be taking any notes.<eos> Is there something you'd like to contribute?<eos> Well, come on, then.<eos> Come on!<eos> You'll need the chalk.<eos> But I... I hadn't completed that proof.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just do.
Partitions.<eos> No, no, no, wait.<eos> This even you could understand.<eos> P of 4 equals 5.<eos> Now, all that means is there are five ways to add up the number 4.<eos> 1+1+1+1, 3+1,<eos> 2+1+1, 2 + 2, and 4.<eos> Seems simple enough.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So it does.
You... You are a man of no faith!<eos> I don't see pictures of anyone here!<eos> Not even family!<eos> Who are you, Mr. Hardy?<eos> How dare you...<eos> How dare you judge me?<eos> But it is you who does of me!<eos> Don't you see?<eos> No.<eos> Quite frankly, I don't.
- Yes, but surely there's no rush.<eos> - Can't you just do this one thing for me?<eos> What's happening?<eos> I had a letter from Hexler.<eos> He wants to lock me up.<eos> Everything will work out for us.<eos> Really.<eos> I know it.<eos> You just have to trust me.<eos> I do.
Why?<eos> You still have my card. "Why?"<eos> Wait.<eos> You're just gonna break up with him because he has children?<eos> Five children.<eos> Five.<eos> What am I, Julie Andrews?<eos> I'm gonna sew matching outfits and sing to escape the Nazis?<eos> He asked me if I wanted to be "part of the team."<eos> - No, I don't!
- Girls.<eos> They're girls.<eos> - That's twice.<eos> Let's go, guys...<eos> Girls.<eos> 23.<eos> We're looking for 23.<eos> There it is.<eos> 'Hi!<eos> How you doing?
- Hello.<eos> Dad!<eos> Say something to her.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> You look very, very nice.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> You showered.<eos> Am I really known as the non-shower guy?<eos> I shower all the time, guys.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Tyler has a playoff game on Saturday...<eos> Yeah?<eos> ...and I think that for the very first time, he won't actually be completely dreading it, thanks to you.<eos> Tell your...<eos> His father the more he works with him, the more he's gonna get confident the more he's gonna belt the ball anytime he gets up there.<eos> Yeah, well, his dad's not really into working with him, you know because to do that, he'd have to show up, which he's just not good at.<eos> You gotta show up for your kids.<eos> It should be boring how reliable a parent is.<eos> It's funny to me that some people don't get that.<eos> You do!
Mom's not home.<eos> This is my dad.<eos> Mark.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Jim!<eos> The cool guy from the safari.<eos> Do you wanna "bowl" me a few pitches?<eos> I'm sure your father wants to do that with you.<eos> No, he doesn't.
One receptionist.<eos> Look, I made a mistake!<eos> You made it at least four mistakes that I know of.<eos> Made.<eos> Past tense.<eos> I was a jerk.<eos> Lauren, you were the best thing in my life.<eos> You and the boys.<eos> And boys need their fathers.<eos> They do.
May I get you a drink?<eos> No.<eos> No, sir. I'm good.<eos> Good. Good man.<eos> In training.<eos> How is it looking with your brother Dave?<eos> Dave?<eos> How do you mean?<eos> You said you were going to talk to him again.<eos> I did.
- Why don't we find you some help?<eos> Oh, yes, please.<eos> If you're sure it's no trouble?<eos> Of course it isn't.<eos> Is it, darling?<eos> Not at all.<eos> - Oh, yes, that is good.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Hmm? - Do bears even have names?<eos> - Of course we do.
I can reveal that our local luminary, Walter Keane, is opening his own gallery<eos> Ruben's gonna choke when he sees this.<eos> I remember when Mama painted that.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> That would have been a while ago.<eos> Sure I'm sure.<eos> It was in our old apartment, and you had me sit on the stool in the kitchen.<eos> No, sweetie, you're confused.<eos> I painted that.<eos> No, Mother did.
I love it.<eos> - We got in early.<eos> We own three. - Oh.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> Killer party.<eos> It's a happening.<eos> So where's your stuff?<eos> We decided that this would just be Walter's show.<eos> Oh, "we" did?
She couldn't break the connection.<eos> Mother was consumed by them.<eos> She was insane.<eos> So, she did that to Doris.<eos> To her lips.<eos> To stop them from talking.<eos> And then Doris went missing?<eos> Missing.<eos> She never left the house, did she? No.<eos> No, she didn't.
- Shut up!<eos> On the ground!<eos> Nobody move!<eos> We know you're out there!<eos> If you don't surrender, we start executing hostages!<eos> Get your head down!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Don't make me tell you again!<eos> Don't look at me!<eos> Don't do it!
Eat it.<eos> You guys need nutrition.<eos> Or not.<eos> I just want to be clear.<eos> You are now telling me that there are four six-foot talking turtles walking around New York City, - and no one has seen them but you?<eos> - That's what I'm telling you.<eos> I don't mean to laugh, but is there anything else we should know about them?<eos> - They're ninjas.<eos> - I'm sorry, what?<eos> - And they do karate.
- What?<eos> - Is it true?<eos> - What true?<eos> Everybody's going around saying you told some patient... that he has 90 hours to live.<eos> No!<eos> I didn't think so, 'cause that's crazy. That's...<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - You did!<eos> - No, I didn't!
- What true?<eos> Everybody's going around saying you told some patient... that he has 90 hours to live.<eos> No!<eos> I didn't think so, 'cause that's crazy. That's...<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - You did!<eos> - No, I didn't!<eos> - I knew it!<eos> - I didn't.
I see it.<eos> Punch it.<eos> Calm, calm, calm, calm!<eos> License and registration, please.<eos> Officer, I'm Dr. Sharon Gill... - and this is a medical emergency- - License and registration.<eos> I understand.<eos> This is my patient, Henry Altmann.<eos> - He needs brain surgery.<eos> - Do you have a license?<eos> No, I don't.
You picked your own path.<eos> You lived your life, even though it pissed me off.<eos> I'm proud of you, kid. Gin.<eos> - That card was up your sleeve.<eos> - No, worse.<eos> For eight days, Henry Altmann never got angry even once.<eos> Except at the very end, when he told death to go fuck himself.<eos> And then he turned his thoughts to things that pleased him... and sailed away.<eos> No one expected Sharon Gill to go back to her old life.<eos> And, indeed, she did not.
Yep.<eos> What do you got there?<eos> It's my disguise.<eos> Your disguise, huh?<eos> Can I see it?<eos> It's a secret. I can't show you.<eos> It's a secret?<eos> You're gonna keep a secret from your dad?<eos> Ryan said he's teaching me to be his partner in crime.<eos> He did, huh?
Oh, no!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Just take responsibility for what you did, James.<eos> Christine, I did it for you.<eos> For us.<eos> They were never gonna let us be together.<eos> You know that.<eos> And I thought it was gonna make it easier.<eos> I really did.
Well, I tried but I figured, why tell you until it was real?<eos> Okay. So why you telling me now?<eos> Well, I got an audition.<eos> In San Francisco.<eos> Wow. Juilliard. Mia, that's...<eos> Way to go.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Yeah, well, I won't get in.<eos> But it's kind of a big deal that I even got an audition.<eos> Most people don't.
You've listened to it, right?<eos> It's asinine.<eos> No.<eos> You were his boy.<eos> And as far as he was concerned, the sun rose and set on you and your siblings.<eos> Judd.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> But I do.
- Will you two get in there and stop this?<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> This is amaz...<eos> - Stop fighting me.<eos> - Get him off of me! If it gets to the point where I think you're being idiots, you're probably being idiots.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Stop it.<eos> What's going on? - He kissed my wife.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - No, he didn't.
I think you're probably right.<eos> - Wait.<eos> The people that lived here.<eos> Do you know anything about them?<eos> - No, Nicky.<eos> - The man who used to live here 20 years ago.<eos> - What about him?<eos> - I just want to know his name.<eos> - No.<eos> No you don't.
- What can I get you, hon?<eos> - A beer, I guess.<eos> - You just roll into town?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - What for?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - We don't get many tourists, being up here in the hills and all.<eos> - It's too bad.<eos> Seems like a nice town.<eos> - Sure does.
- No, it's...<eos> Who are you?<eos> - I'm Carter Wills.<eos> I'd be your... your second cousin, I guess.<eos> - My what?<eos> - Listen, the others might be too afraid to say it, but you have to haul ass on out of town, kid, or you're gonna get us all killed.<eos> - I think you think I'm somebody else.<eos> - No, you think you're somebody else.<eos> And, listen, he doesn't know who you are yet.<eos> Only a few of us do.
- Hell, John, some of us ain't even changed in years.<eos> - I can't even barely grow my sideburns anymore.<eos> It's just a little fuzz.<eos> - He's the youngest and the strongest.<eos> Connor kills him, he'll have no more reason to come after us.<eos> - And then what?<eos> Then we just give him Angelina?<eos> - That was the deal we made.<eos> - The deal I made.<eos> - Well, I didn't.
The light embraces and protects thee.<eos> BARACHELI Sir.<eos> What are your orders?<eos> - I beg you to reconsider.<eos> - There's no time.<eos> Items in the vault are sacred.<eos> You cannot remove or replace anything.<eos> Then I shall accept full responsibility.<eos> You have not the authority to do this.<eos> None of us do.
- Corpses possessed by demons.<eos> - It can't happen. it won't.<eos> First thing they'll do is wipe out the Gargoyle Order.<eos> There's so few gargoyles left, they won't stand a chance.<eos> Then Naberius will launch a war on humans.<eos> Kill most, enslave the rest.<eos> Your world will end.<eos> And what will you do?<eos> It has nothing to do with me.<eos> Of course, it does.
- Mmm.<eos> - We're going to get a terrible report.<eos> - Mother won't be surprised.<eos> - She thinks she has a very odd daughter.<eos> - Not odd.<eos> Just interesting.<eos> I've never known where I fit.<eos> Does it need to be a place?<eos> Well, I don't know what to say to the pair of you!<eos> No, really, I don't!
- Yes.<eos> Inspirational stories for the damned.<eos> - What about you?<eos> Are you still writing?<eos> - Writing.<eos> That belongs to another life.<eos> I've been thinking and, erm...<eos> I want to look after you.<eos> We belong together now.<eos> Don't we?
I don't want to carry this.<eos> Can I carry something else?<eos> Nah, this is you.<eos> I don't want to carry that one.<eos> Give me the sleeping bag.<eos> All right.<eos> How did you guess that? You're good.<eos> Nah, nah.<eos> She's doesn't know exactly what.<eos> Yes, she does.
Can I carry something else?<eos> Nah, this is you.<eos> I don't want to carry that one.<eos> Give me the sleeping bag.<eos> All right.<eos> How did you guess that? You're good.<eos> Nah, nah.<eos> She's doesn't know exactly what.<eos> Yes, she does.<eos> Yes, I do.
You don't think they'll let us settle in Canaan?<eos> They'll see us as invaders.<eos> They won't have a choice.<eos> We're as big as any tribe.<eos> We're as big as a nation of tribes and that concerns me even more.<eos> Why?<eos> This many people?<eos> You have to ask?<eos> But we all have the same goal.<eos> We do now.
Hassan will escort you away from here. I will see you again... very soon.<eos> You have to be strong.<eos> You have to be strong. For the children, for us.<eos> My love.<eos> GOD WITH US !<eos> Stop, this is finished.<eos> Leave.<eos> My days draw to an end, my son.<eos> - No, father!<eos> - They do... child.
You say that... they would fear me.<eos> It didn't seem afraid.<eos> They are afraid of what you can become.<eos> What do you mean "What I could become"?<eos> There was a prophecy, recorded in a text called the "Jinn Scrolls".<eos> It was lost a long time.<eos> But it said that in a battle between man and Jinn One shall emerged more powerful than both.<eos> And will lead the world into a golden age.<eos> You think it talks about me?<eos> I do.
- A barbecue.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And we get one representative from each department to help put it on, usually the new guy.<eos> And the new guy in shipping is you.<eos> So you want me to help plan a party?<eos> It's voluntary, off-the-clock.<eos> There will be others, too.<eos> Someone from sales, a guy from design, that cute English chick in accounting, Fiona.<eos> - You wanna do it?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Are you...<eos> He doesn't know?<eos> Your wild and crazy sister has been taking...<eos> Give me a drumroll.<eos> Come on, drumroll. Come on, louder.<eos> Scuba diving lessons.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Doesn't that sound like fun?<eos> Yeah, if you like scuba diving, yeah.<eos> I do.
You mind not talking?<eos> That's good.<eos> Okay. Thanks.<eos> Bobby, how does it feel to lose?<eos> That's a stupid question.<eos> How'd he beat you, Bob?<eos> Would you understand if I answered that?<eos> He was playing to draw.<eos> Bobby, no one expected you to beat Spassky.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Yeah. It's not fair.<eos> Hey, Bobby, are you okay?<eos> Well, you know that 727 that went down?<eos> You know, they said the fuel tank exploded.<eos> Yeah, well, that seemed kind of funny to me.<eos> Right?<eos> You know, they don't tell us everything.<eos> Yeah, no, they don't, that's true.<eos> And the KGB, they kill people.<eos> They do.
Hey, Bob.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> - All right, come on. - Yeah.<eos> Say hi to Nadia.<eos> Don't forget to stitch her up when she stabs herself, all right?<eos> Tossing the missing piece of the One-Armed Man around like a ham... and the front door's open!<eos> - He didn't see anything.<eos> - But he could've.<eos> But he didn't.
I was feared.<eos> When I walked into a place, people sat up. They sat up straight.<eos> They noticed.<eos> What'd you ever have?<eos> And the fucking bar stool you put that old biddy at.<eos> You bought her free drinks and don't think I don't know that you did it on purpose?<eos> That was my stool and nobody sat on that stool because it was Cousin Marv's stool.<eos> And that meant something.<eos> That meant something!<eos> But it didn't.
That's my cousin Marv.<eos> So long as nobody knew that he'd paid Marv back off, you know?<eos> - You see where this is going?<eos> - Yeah, kid had to be ripped off.<eos> No. Kid had to be killed.<eos> So nobody'd know he'd paid Marv back off.<eos> So that's what we did.<eos> - So you...<eos> - Yeah. - ...killed him.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
You hurt harmless dogs that can't defend themselves.<eos> I'm tired of you, man.<eos> I'm tired of you.<eos> You embarrass me.<eos> You know, he would've kept coming back that's why he would've done.<eos> People like this, they take something from you and you let them... and they just act like they keep coming back.<eos> And you still owe them something and they never, never change.<eos> You can never change their mind.<eos> You just... I mean, you just fucking shot him.<eos> Yes, I did. Absolutely.
But he could turn up.<eos> People do all the time.<eos> That's true.<eos> If he does, it'll probably be in a psych ward.<eos> Which is where he was the night Whelan disappeared.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> It's true.<eos> Deeds always took credit for the Whelan hit 'cause nobody else wanted to.<eos> He thought it would help his street cred... - but he didn't kill Whelan.<eos> - He didn't?
Oh!<eos> Oh, my!<eos> Oh! Oh, my God!<eos> I'm gonna come. I'm gonna come.<eos> I'm gonna come.<eos> That was incredible.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm gonna go make pizza bagels.<eos> Victory tasted sweet.<eos> The hangover from his recent drug binge did not.
I can't even think of somebody...<eos> - Thanks, Lloyd.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Are you married?<eos> Why? Are you trying to pick me up?<eos> - Well, marriage is hard goddamn work.<eos> - Yeah, they don't tell you that when you're registering at Crate and Barrel, huh?<eos> No, they do not.
Like I said, things don't change much in Woodbury, but every now and then, we need to be reminded that change can be good.<eos> The pharmacy had a whole new look, and I wanted to see it for myself.<eos> Ma'am, are you finding everything all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> And may I say this pharmacy has the most impressive collection of douches I have ever seen.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> High blood pressure, acid reflux, chlamydia.<eos> Never would have guessed.<eos> No one ever does.
We think he's somewhere in Thailand, maybe Cambodia.<eos> Nick, you don't need to think about this right now, man.<eos> All the guys sent you this card and I'm going to put it right here.<eos> There was a funeral.<eos> How much did Dragovic pay you, counsel?<eos> I'm a diplomat.<eos> I have immunity!<eos> - I have a wife!<eos> Children!<eos> - So did I.
Holy shit!<eos> You, look at me.<eos> Lights out, motherfucker.<eos> Things just got real for you, kid.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Go!<eos> Bet you'd like to stick your dick in that, huh?<eos> I'd love to.<eos> I bet that kid doesn't even know what a pussy looks like.<eos> I do.
Mickey, why aren't you on vacation in Rio?<eos> I was in Rio.<eos> Gregory and I were in Rio.<eos> I get a call from Hiram's office saying I should be in his office right away first thing this morning.<eos> From Rio?<eos> What kind of meeting?<eos> I get to City Hall.<eos> Hiram keeps me waiting forever, and finally the commissioner comes out and he says that Hiram doesn't want to see me anymore.<eos> I wanted to scream, "I haven't slept in two days, you dumb fuck!"<eos> But I didn't.
- Ben.<eos> I think that you just... got to have the bad days so you can love the good days even more.<eos> This day has been terrible!<eos> Terrible day.<eos> Yeah!<eos> A horrible day!<eos> A no-good... Very bad day!<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think this day sucks!<eos> Yes! It does.
Did you know my mother?<eos> Intimately.<eos> But don't worry anymore.<eos> I will take care of you.<eos> Lara!<eos> Please, Lara.<eos> Please...<eos> Please, Lara, let's leave this place.<eos> You don't want this.<eos> You don't!
-No, it's my phone.<eos> It's not a good time right now, dad.<eos> I cannot believe you're talking to your father.<eos> -He just called.<eos> -Your father!<eos> -I'm calling him back.<eos> -Please!<eos> He calls you all the... It's like its father's day with you every day!<eos> I mean, the guy calls you all the time!<eos> -No, he doesn't.
I mean...<eos> My God!<eos> That's terrific!<eos> What a terrific...<eos> Terrific name.<eos> Yeah, you don't come across that name too often.<eos> No, but in therapy you do.<eos> It's kinda common in therapy.<eos> You know a Glo stick?<eos> Yes, I do.
Wait, don't do that.<eos> You need to go.<eos> Yes. It's ringing.<eos> Jesus Christ...<eos> It's all very confusing.<eos> And it's...<eos> Confusing.<eos> Very.<eos> -You know, Josh knows about us now.<eos> -He does?
Then I'm going to beat the shit out of anybody who paid to sleep with my daughter.<eos> Who was it?<eos> It was him.<eos> -Him... And him.<eos> -That's a lie!<eos> A bullet can kill, but a punch can change things for the living.<eos> I'll give you spoilers.<eos> John Wayne and Randolph Scott tore apart a bar fighting for Marlene Dietrich.<eos> John Wayne won, of course, and they lived happily ever after.<eos> We never did it.
They're really slamming it out but Rocil is getting a bad beating from Pacquiao here.<eos> The crowd is roaring on its feet.<eos> Rocil is slowly getting up, no...<eos> He has been counted out.<eos> His opponents were, very often, much bigger.<eos> They looked much bigger than him.<eos> Every time he entered the ring, then I get scared.<eos> "Can he do this? Can he handle this guy?"<eos> And, he did.<eos> Amazingly, he did.
They're just hoping to talk to you guys.<eos> This is fish in a barrel.<eos> So, I'll see you tomorrow?<eos> - What's the worse that could happen?<eos> - Gee, I don't know.<eos> I think looking like an idiot and fainting would rank right up there.<eos> Okay, so don't do that.<eos> You know, your advice sucks.<eos> Does it?<eos> Yes, yes it does.
Bad.<eos> Like, but just listen to yourself.<eos> I say, "I'm nervous." You say, "Don't be nervous."<eos> I say, "I feel sick." You say, "Don't puke." I say "I don't wanna go over there..."<eos> Okay, I get it. I get it.<eos> All right, well, first listen.<eos> Don't go to hit on them.<eos> Go over to talk to them.<eos> I just wanna drink my beer.<eos> - No, you don't.
We were asked to play the BUZZ 104 Block Party.<eos> Look, we've been more than cool, man.<eos> You only want to play Saturdays, fine.<eos> You don't want to play other bars, okay, we can swallow that for now, but this is big, man.<eos> You owe us.<eos> Wilco, Death Cab, radio promos.<eos> Do you know what this could mean, dude?<eos> This could be the first step.<eos> I mean, I don't wanna think about the audience.<eos> Yes, I do.
Yeah, I recognized you when you first came into the shop.<eos> Just took me a minute to figure out where from.<eos> Well, then, you know my story. No.<eos> I don't know your story, man.<eos> All I know is what I read.<eos> What would you say if I told you that my son wrote all the songs the band plays?<eos> Damn.<eos> I'd say, "I didn't see that comin'."<eos> Wait, does Quentin know?<eos> He does now.
How's it going?<eos> So, do you want to tell us a little bit about your approach with this cover?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'd love a little explanation.<eos> It...<eos> It is what it is.<eos> "It is what it is"? That's what you say when you get a parking ticket.<eos> I know.<eos> It looks to me like the guy here wants to escape.<eos> Does he?
What?<eos> If you can take it, you can make it.<eos> All right. You train and you fight way harder than those other guys.<eos> And you win.<eos> You get out from under them.<eos> Or you keep going the way you're going and you end up as a bum in the streets.<eos> You can do this, Lou.<eos> Just gotta believe you can.<eos> I don't believe.<eos> I do.
I want youse to meet our new associate, Knuckles.<eos> He'll be the weapons and the safe expert.<eos> Knuckles, say hello to Fingers and Lucky.<eos> Hiya, mack. Welcome aboard.<eos> What's buzzin', cousin?<eos> All right.<eos> So, which of you geniuses found this place?<eos> I did.<eos> Ah, here we go.<eos> I did.
Sixteen percent better if you give them a single.<eos> Thirty-eight percent if you shoot them the double.<eos> Why do I get the feeling like I'm wasting my time here?<eos> Am I gonna win, or not?<eos> - 'Cause this seems like a waste of time.<eos> - You hired me to win.<eos> You're gonna win. - Put this on.<eos> - Why?<eos> I'm already dressed.<eos> - How you doing?
Hey. Remember me from before?<eos> - You know what, I do.<eos> - That's right.<eos> I didn't know that you were Annie's foster mom.<eos> - Amongst other things.<eos> - l know.<eos> She said that you're a very good singer.<eos> What'd she say?<eos> "She's a really good singer."<eos> No, she didn't do any of that.
I think the girl's ass should be worshipped by indigenous peoples.<eos> But when you start talking about girlfriend and boyfriend, and meeting the parents, it's exit time for me.<eos> Weren't you the one that said get in or get out?<eos> Part of getting in, genius, is knowing when to get...<eos> You're not listening.<eos> I had to break up with him because I'm not Jewish.<eos> What kind of weak-ass man...<eos> Hold up, hold up, hold up.<eos> I thought you said he broke up with you.<eos> He did.
Oh, my God!<eos> Hi, puppy!<eos> Danny. you got him!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hi!<eos> Hug Mommy!<eos> Hug me.<eos> Baby.<eos> He needs a good home, and we have that now.<eos> Yes, we do.
Like, turn the courtyard into a beer garden.<eos> Maybe get some patio dining going.<eos> Expand the menu just a smidge.<eos> Of course I've thought about it.<eos> You know what it costs to do something like that?<eos> - I have some savings. - Yeah.<eos> I can get Bernie to help out on the supply side.<eos> But why not take out a second mortgage on this place, put some real money in here?<eos> Now you're talking like you're gonna stick around for a while.<eos> And if I did?
- It is.<eos> I would like to take this time to propose a toast.<eos> Now, I don't know to what extent you and Joan have talked about the magic that's been going on in our relationship.<eos> Magic?<eos> Let him finish.<eos> He wants to do this.<eos> Baby, that's not true.<eos> Okay, I don't want to do it.<eos> I'm doing it because we agreed that I'm better at it. - No.<eos> We didn't.

- Do it.<eos> Negative at the source.<eos> Give me a floor rundown.<eos> Negative on three.<eos> Negative on two.<eos> Snake the upper levels. Work down to me.<eos> - Kiss me.<eos> - What?<eos> Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable.<eos> Yes, they do.
Chris.<eos> Chris, I'm sorry... I don't know. Maybe I was testing you.<eos> I don't need to be tested.<eos> Listen, do you want to maybe get a cup of coffee... someplace quiet... private?<eos> I'd like to use your key. Just once.<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> Hey, it doesn't matter what I think.<eos> Have fun.<eos> - Does everyone still have a key?<eos> - Course we do.
So, what... what happened to him?<eos> He and his concubine are now cramped in a tiny one-bedroom condo.<eos> But I'm guessing he's happy.<eos> She's blonde, 23, with a brand-new pair of fake breasts.<eos> How can men stand fake breasts?<eos> Why are women always talking about "fake tits" this, "fake tits" that? I mean, listen.<eos> Girls, if it's a decent boob job, who fuckin' cares.<eos> My mom, she's got... false teeth. Okay?<eos> When she smiles, do people give her shit and say, "Oh, my God! Look! Fake!"<eos> No, they don't.
Quickly, human child, before the owls return.<eos> That pipe will see you to the outside world.<eos> Go!<eos> I'd like to sing some more.<eos> Go on so.<eos> Do-la-mon, a-pena pwee, Do-la-mon...<eos> There's a bus.<eos> Quick, Saoirse.<eos> I just saw real fairies.<eos> Course you did.
and i made a proxy.<eos> and that makes me invisible, unaccountable.<eos> i'm going to disappear like he disappeared, and no one will come after me.<eos> before i leave, i'm going to make sure that he will never forget me again.<eos> he's going to understand what it feels like to hurt the way i hurt.<eos> so this is my breakthrough.<eos> taking a human life is easy for me because i'm different.<eos> -i'm not even human.<eos> i'm better than that.<eos> -william, i didn't do anything to you!
I wish I knew how content you were with your father having his way with you!<eos> Paul, take it down a notch, man.<eos> Lily, get over here!<eos> Cool it, bud.<eos> Let's face it:<eos> you've been kind of an oddball lately.<eos> That's not winning you any popularity contests!<eos> Get the hell out of my house!<eos> This has nothing to do with you!<eos> The hell it does!
- I'm on the street.<eos> - I'm parked up...<eos> Tried to get a space in the big lot. I had to go around.<eos> - But eventually I found one. - Here you go.<eos> - Where's the family?<eos> - Couldn't make it.<eos> School. Oh.<eos> I didn't know kids in Chicago go to school in the summer.<eos> There isn't.<eos> They just do...
Being a drunk.<eos> Ronald Reagan oversaw the fall of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Cold War.<eos> But any discussion of his legacy ends with jelly beans, naps and Alzheimer's.<eos> - Reagan? Wow.<eos> With all due...<eos> I'm gonna say this as professionally and gently as I possibly can.<eos> You're a civil servant in a corn-belt, Bible-banging backwater.<eos> Nobody, nobody, gives a rat's ass about your legacy.<eos> But I do, you see.<eos> I do.
Objection.<eos> Asked and answered.<eos> Overruled.<eos> Correct.<eos> So on one of the worst days of your life... you enter the mini-mart... you see a man you hate...<eos> Objection.<eos> Argumentative.<eos> Let him finish.<eos> You see a man that you hate, and minutes later... you've altered your route... and both you and that man are on the same road at the same time... only you're in your car with his blood on it... and he's in a ravine with his kidneys ruptured and his back broken... and you don't remember hitting him?<eos> I do not.
Off the record.<eos> Two days ago, this man, Erik Lehnsherr... escaped from a maximum security prison inside the Pentagon.<eos> We believe that this woman is a former associate of Lehnsherr's.<eos> They were together in Cuba, the day of the crisis in '62.<eos> He was also implicated in Kennedy's assassination.<eos> What about that thing?<eos> We don't know what that thing is, sir.<eos> Actually, we really don't know what any of them are.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
Was it a dream?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> But it felt like it had happened.<eos> That's what scares me.<eos> It was so horrible!<eos> And no one has asked for forgiveness, not even me.<eos> No one has asked for forgiveness.<eos> So what happened?<eos> It's so horrible I don't dare telling.<eos> Then don't, you stubborn fool.
All for North Wind plan.<eos> His...<eos> His is better.<eos> What?<eos> I'm sorry, boys.<eos> But I can't lead you this time.<eos> But... we're a team.<eos> And you're our skipper, Skipper.<eos> We don't need these guys.<eos> No, Kowalski, but Private does.
Bunnies! Pandas!<eos> Charlize, they're on the ray!<eos> Helen, hunt them down!<eos> William, hurt them.<eos> Halle, bury them!<eos> Hugh, Jack, man the battle stations!<eos> Kevin, bake on!<eos> We're still gonna need that victory cake!<eos> We're only gonna get one shot at this, boys.<eos> How we doing on those snow globes?
Yes it is!<eos> Have you seen Zero Dark Thirty?<eos> No, but I know how to waterboard, though.<eos> Stop drinking it!<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> It's sad what you're trying to do.<eos> It's embarrassing.<eos> All right.<eos> I hate Mossi.<eos> Everybody does.
What my child's telling me will get me laughed out of this town.<eos> That's what I'm saying. I don't know what to preach.<eos> I don't have anything to say.<eos> Just speak from the heart, Todd, like you always do.<eos> What about fear do we struggle with?<eos> Is it confusion?<eos> Is it doubt?<eos> Is it questions?<eos> I got questions.<eos> We all do.
Yeah.<eos> Call Sheila.<eos> She'll watch them.<eos> Tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Honey, no, we can't afford it.<eos> That charity auction last year, dinner for two.<eos> Maple Grove restaurant, your favorite place.<eos> We used that already.<eos> No, we did not.

I loved my grandfather very much.<eos> He was there with me when my father couldn't be.<eos> He taught me to weld.<eos> He gave me that slingshot.<eos> I know.<eos> We play with it.<eos> That's right.<eos> And he was a good man.<eos> He was a really good man, but I don't know what he believed in.<eos> None of us did.
Stay away from me!<eos> - No. No.<eos> - H2O.<eos> Quit with the noise!<eos> That's it. I'm coming down there. I'm going to give you a what-for...<eos> You killed her.<eos> Where should I start?<eos> Let's begin with your pretty face.<eos> But by the end... I will make it a masterpiece.<eos> Do it.
Sit down. Leonid told me about you.<eos> So, what does a pretty girl... want to know about such mess thing?<eos> I'm writing a memorandum on Rainmaker for my employer.<eos> What does your employer do?<eos> He buys oil fields in the Middle East... Mostly Iraq.<eos> Many of them were developed by Russian.<eos> You know about... the technology, biogenetic stuff?<eos> Sorry.<eos> biogenic oil, decomposition technology?<eos> No, I don't not really.
Lawyer?<eos> Annabel Richter.<eos> The one you met at the hotel. The one you'd like to fuck.<eos> What?<eos> Not true?<eos> You're too old for her, Tommy.<eos> We both are.<eos> See her, love her, but you'll never get her, not even with all that black money you've got tucked away in your bank vaults.<eos> As far as I am aware, Miss Richter represents a client with a legitimate financial interest with my bank.<eos> Your bank does business with the Russians, right?

- Oh, hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Wow, you look handsome.<eos> Here, I got you these.<eos> They're chocolate covered pralines.<eos> I hope you like them.<eos> - Can I ask you a couple questions?<eos> - OK.<eos> - Do you have an onion?<eos> - I do.
She was diagnosed with leukemia a few weeks after that picture was taken.<eos> She'd just turned two.<eos> And I remember that day.<eos> You know, it was just a day.<eos> And you want so much to go back to just a not-so-special day like that, you know.<eos> But you never can.<eos> I can't imagine how difficult that must have been for your family.<eos> We both started drinking too much.<eos> I quit.<eos> He never did.
OK.<eos> Good.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Does it matter?<eos> Hi, it's me, it's Amanda.<eos> I was hoping maybe we could talk.<eos> A lot of things have changed since I last saw you.<eos> And well, I just...<eos> I want to say I love you.<eos> I do, Dawson.
What does that mean, exacﬂy?<eos> He needs a transplant and very soon.<eos> Doctor, I have lost one child already.<eos> I cannot lose another.<eos> I understand.<eos> Hi, it's me, it's Amanda.<eos> I was hoping maybe we could talk.<eos> A lot of things have changed since I last saw you.<eos> I wanted to say I love you.<eos> I do, Dawson.
She's a beautiful little girl.<eos> She had blond hair and blue eyes.<eos> She lived in a castle, see?<eos> The captain has turned off the seat belt sign.<eos> So feel free to move about the cabin.<eos> However we do recommend when seated to keep your seat belt securely fastened in case of any unexpected turbulence.<eos> See?<eos> Urban myth.<eos> What if you killed us all?<eos> But I didn't.
Alright, I love you--<eos> You gotta break up with her, man.<eos> What?<eos> You gotta break up with her.<eos> Are you on drugs?<eos> No.<eos> She walks all over you.<eos> You--you--you-- you're just too blind to see it because you're in shock that she talks to you, let alone actually dates you.<eos> Okay, n--news flash, uh, Desmond and Rafe love her.<eos> No they don't.
I see.<eos> Okay.<eos> So this is about you now, obviously.<eos> My best friends, my lifelong best friends, just ripped my heart out of my chest and told me that they never wanna see me again and you're fucking crying?<eos> - I-- you're hurt?<eos> ! You're the one who's hurt?<eos> First of all, I am not crying.<eos> Barry, I'm not crying, but my feelings were hurt because your lifelong best friends said some not very nice things about me.<eos> That hurt you?<eos> Yes, it did.
No.<eos> He sold us out.<eos> Fuck, they're coming up the driveway.<eos> Shit, they're coming.<eos> Shit. They're right there.<eos> - Just go, you answer it.<eos> - You answer it. You answer!<eos> You are gonna answer.<eos> You do it. You do it.<eos> You do it.
Fuck, no way. Jesus.<eos> I'm exhausted.<eos> That would be a fucking disaster.<eos> Jesus.<eos> We did it!<eos> We did it.<eos> We fucking did it. We did it.<eos> We did it.<eos> Come on. We fucking did that shit.<eos> We totally did it.
And then you gonna tell me, who out there might wanna buy it.<eos> Sir, the high-end community is a...<eos> The high-end community is a... It's a tight-knit...<eos> Tight-knit... The high-end community is a very tight-knit...<eos> I cannot possibly betray the confidentiality of my buyers!<eos> Now, who again is this buyer of yours?<eos> Carina.<eos> Yes, Master.<eos> Your people do have elbows, do they not?<eos> We do, Master.
- Make that two, please.<eos> God.<eos> - Nancy, right?<eos> Gwen.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thank God for you.<eos> Girl doesn't show up and leaves me to handle two cabins.<eos> You're a lifesaver.<eos> If I pass out, just promise to catch me before I hit the floor.<eos> Not if I do first.
Shut up!<eos> There's a dead body and a briefcase!<eos> In the briefcase you'll find a bomb!<eos> Bullshit, you're lying!<eos> There is a bomb on this plane.<eos> Believe me, please!<eos> Get off of him.<eos> I said get off of him!<eos> Get off him!<eos> Do it now.
Yeah, well... he's alive and well and living with his preferred family, so...<eos> But enough about me. I wanna know more about this Dark Lord thing that you're going through.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's like one day, I realized that I wasn't who I was because I decided to be that way.<eos> You know? Like I was just falling into step or something.<eos> So out came the eyeliner?<eos> It's better than being like everyone else.<eos> Yeah, you got that right.<eos> You know my pathetic father always wanted to be an architect?<eos> Yeah, he still does.
Good.<eos> Good.<eos> - Listen, honey.<eos> I...<eos> - Dad, no, I...<eos> I need you to know that I fucked up, too.<eos> So I'm in no position to judge you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You can totally judge me.<eos> I did something really stupid.
I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received.<eos> And that, consequently, this country is at war with Germany.<eos> For the second time in the lives of most of us, we are... at war.<eos> To find a peaceful way out...<eos> Papers, please.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - Oh, the lady told me to wait.<eos> - In my office?<eos> She tell you to help yourself to tea while you were here?<eos> No, she didn't.
So, I can give these men orders now?<eos> I hate to say it, but yes.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Keith and Charles, you're both fired.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - What?<eos> You're mediocre linguists, and positively poor code-breakers.<eos> Alan, you can't just fire Keith and Charles.<eos> - Well, he just said I could.<eos> - No, I did no such thing.

- It's about cryptography.<eos> - Like secret messages?<eos> Not secret.<eos> That's the brilliant part.<eos> Messages that anyone can see, but no one knows what they mean unless you have the key.<eos> How's that different from talking?<eos> - Talking?<eos> - When people talk to each other, they never say what they mean.<eos> They say something else, and you're expected to just know what they mean.<eos> Only I never do.
And people... talk about the war as this epic battle between... civilizations... freedom versus tyranny, democracy versus Nazism, armies of millions bleeding into the ground, fleets of ships weighing down the oceans, planes dropping bombs from the sky until they obliterated the sun itself... the war wasn't like that for us.<eos> For us, it was just... half a dozen crossword enthusiasts in a tiny village in the South of England.<eos> This is... your victory.<eos> Victory... of the cause of freedom in every land.<eos> This is a solemn but glorious hour.<eos> I wish that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to see this day.<eos> Was I God?<eos> No. Because...<eos> God didn't win the war.<eos> We did.
- in the direction the helo is flying.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> There!<eos> On that mountain top.<eos> Lock on it.<eos> Zoom in.<eos> Jesus Christ. It's the President.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Anyone here got an ID?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Well, it's not for tonight.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, I don't like my steaks all fancy.<eos> Just burnt black with tons of ketchup.<eos> Figures.<eos> Figures what?<eos> Sorry?<eos> I thought you had spoken.<eos> Gosh.<eos> Maybe I did.
Porter, please.<eos> You can't go days without talking to anyone.<eos> Please, talk to me.<eos> Oh, you want to talk?<eos> Okay.<eos> How's my wife?<eos> Does she know i'm here?<eos> She knows about her son?<eos> Does she know that he melted in my arms?<eos> Does she?
- Come on, Trey.<eos> Let's get in the car.<eos> - Everyone here?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This is crazy, guys.<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, can I use your cell?<eos> My son's out there. I got no signal.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I don't either.
The oceans.<eos> Space.<eos> Everything.<eos> Wembley.<eos> What is this?<eos> The jellyfish commercial that you wanted.<eos> You said they were erotic yet deadly, like women.<eos> I never said that.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Sitting on a bench, looking like an idiot.<eos> Sweet, wonderful grandson, don't you understand?<eos> Grandpa doesn't want to go out.<eos> He's fine at home.<eos> I figured you wouldn't want to go out, so I came with a plan B.<eos> Mom, it's so hard to get taken seriously as an artist... without a backer.<eos> Didn't Sebastian say you could do a show whenever you wanted?<eos> Yeah, and soon as I show up to ask him, he says to me, "you're welcome, - as long as you cough up the cash."<eos> - Well, how much does he want?<eos> A lot, and they only do exhibitions with other artists.
- My daughter's birthday.<eos> - Mom...<eos> - Hi, Fred.<eos> He's your boyfriend.<eos> Why don't you invite him?<eos> Oh, he wouldn't be interested in this, honey.<eos> Children screaming all over the place and junk food and balloons and vomit everywhere.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You've got better things to do.<eos> - Well, actually, I don't.
I'm in.<eos> And why would you knock?<eos> Mi casa, su casa.<eos> Bring on God's country!<eos> Dennis Lillee's a great man.<eos> So are you, love.<eos> Who's ready for a boat race?<eos> One, two, three!<eos> Faster!<eos> Do it!
Your tea, Mom.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's ridiculous, isn't it? - Sorry?<eos> - This.<eos> I mean, look.<eos> What?<eos> Look.<eos> Go to hell, you filthy traitor.<eos> I mean, no one talks like that in real life, do they?<eos> Heroes do, son. Heroes.
This is... (GROANING)<eos> Guys, come see this!<eos> "Cross river three times to safety." Hold on...<eos> If we head straight to the river and cross here... here and... here... Alex:<eos> Stannum Valley.<eos> We end up in the middle of nowhere.<eos> - This is good. - Stannum.<eos> I think I've heard that name somewhere.<eos> I think it's...<eos> Probably something boring to do with Vikings.
We like the guy. Definitely don't think his son deserves to be kidnapped.<eos> Kidnapped?<eos> Who said anything about kidnapping?<eos> - I wanna say you did. - I didn't.<eos> - I heard you say it.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - I feel like you did. - I'm sure I did.<eos> You said "kidnapping." I was like, "What a weird word."<eos> - Should be more "kidnabbing."<eos> - No, I did not.
- I didn't.<eos> - I feel like you did. - I'm sure I did.<eos> You said "kidnapping." I was like, "What a weird word."<eos> - Should be more "kidnabbing."<eos> - No, I did not.<eos> Did I say that?<eos> - I think you might have, sir.<eos> - You sure?<eos> Well, I got a little lost with all their yammering, but pretty sure.<eos> All right, maybe I did. - Hey.
- We did, yeah.<eos> - Yeah. A lot. - We got arrested for a long list of felonies.<eos> But because you took a bullet for the detective, DA got rid of the biggies.<eos> - Dropped some charges? Nice.<eos> - You're like a little Kevin Costner.<eos> You're our bodyguard.<eos> Ha, ha.<eos> Pretty sweet. All right, so I'm guessing we saved the business.<eos> - Nope.<eos> We did not.

What's happening?<eos> Worst pornographically shaven at this childhood rape fantasy.<eos> Get a life!<eos> Maybe you should get a dad.<eos> Isn't it pathetic enough that you want to play me?<eos> You HATE me.<eos> That yet you are desperate to be me?<eos> You want that role that you're not gonna get.<eos> You don't even have the chops.<eos> I did.
You could've had a judge standing by in the delivery room.<eos> Maybe you tried that.<eos> We tried a lot of things, Benjie.<eos> Mostly we tried our best.<eos> That's in your book.<eos> That's a big thing in your book.<eos> Trying your best.<eos> It's supposed to give people major points.<eos> I don't know that girl anymore so...<eos> Not that I ever did.
Why would you ever want to go back to a place like that?<eos> Because I like being with my friends.<eos> Your friends?<eos> Do you even remember what happened?<eos> In the bathroom?<eos> - Zooey!<eos> - What?<eos> In the bathroom, do you remember what happened?<eos> Look, Karina and I aced the practice test, okay?<eos> - No, you didn't.

Looks like we're walking.<eos> Don't stand there.<eos> Come in.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Looking for you.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Do you know why I'm here?<eos> - You have a brother.<eos> Peter, yes?<eos> Yes, you do.
- Give me a hand.<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> - Come on, give me a hand.<eos> - Holy shit. - Stokes!<eos> Granger!<eos> Jesus.<eos> - We gotta get out of here.<eos> - Holy shit!<eos> - He just said that.<eos> I did.
You'll dance a little naked there.<eos> You're going to caress a bit. Let's see if you're queer or not.<eos> What are we waiting for?<eos> Undress, guys.<eos> They don't understand.<eos> Handsome!<eos> Handsome!<eos> No, but look at him!<eos> He doesn't understand!<eos> Really, he doesn't!
We've the cape and the cow.<eos> You've got the cape!<eos> What have you done with the cow?<eos> - She ran away.<eos> - What?<eos> I never even reached home.<eos> I've been looking for her all night.<eos> How could you?<eos> Well, she might just as easily have run away from you.<eos> - Yeah, but she didn't.

Wait a minute.<eos> That cow doesn't look as white as milk to me.<eos> - Of course she is.<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> Come on.<eos> She has to be.<eos> This cow has been covered with flour!<eos> You didn't get a real white cow?<eos> We had a cow as white as milk.<eos> Honestly, we did!
Yes.<eos> Anything can happen in the woods<eos> May I kiss you?<eos> Any moment we could be crushed<eos> Don't feel rushed<eos> This is ridiculous What am I doing here?<eos> I'm in the wrong story<eos> Wait, wait, wait, we can't do this!<eos> You have a princess!<eos> - Well, yes, I do.
I just wanted to thank everybody for coming tonight, and just take a minute of your time.<eos> When Donnie and I decided to have this party, it was really as a way of saying thank you to our parents.<eos> For your love and support and for putting up with us for the past 25 years.<eos> But really, to thank them for their love and their respect and their devotion to each other.<eos> Through hard work and a little help from their kids... and lots of love.<eos> My parents have created something very rare.<eos> A good marriage.<eos> We love you guys.<eos> - Well, got the house to ourselves. - Yes.<eos> We do.
No, you go straight to Holt.<eos> That'll do me just fine.<eos> But, the thing is, I get bored, just the TV for company, so...<eos> I thought to myself...<eos> "I'll... what the hell, I'll take that drive down to Cleaves Mills and I'll just ask a few of my little questions."<eos> Here.<eos> Have a look.<eos> Turn it over.<eos> - Oh, I see you do know my name.<eos> - Indeed I do.
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I'm so sorry!<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> So, uh... what... what exactly is your test on tomorrow?<eos> Can I confess something to you?<eos> You don't have a dead wife or anything, do you?<eos> - 'Cause I can't take that again today.<eos> I don't really have a test tomorrow.<eos> - You don't?
Uh, well, we-we were following maps, and it just happened to lead here, so we were trying to help our friend Echo...<eos> well, he's an alien<eos> - Oh, God...<eos> - ...that we're trying to get him on a ship. See, look, it used to have six symbols, but now it has three, so that means we're almost there. Crazy, right?<eos> Munch, will you shut up?<eos> An alien came to Earth to give you guys maps?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - You did not just see that.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
OK.<eos> So just your brother, Molly Hooper and 100 tramps.<eos> Ha, no!<eos> 25 at most.<eos> Seriously, it's not a joke?<eos> You're really keeping this?<eos> Er, yeah.<eos> Sure?<eos> Mary likes it.<eos> Hmm, no, she doesn't.

For kids.<eos> And...<eos> I'm taking them to this tournament in Auckland.<eos> They might lose, but at least it's something I can do for them, eh?<eos> Something different, positive.<eos> I was thinking maybe...<eos> Maybe Mana could come, too.<eos> Maybe he'd enjoy it.<eos> Pretty hard if he doesn't know how to play, eh?<eos> He does.
Good morning, big boy.<eos> Okay, guys.<eos> Ready for school?<eos> Nope.<eos> Ha-ha!<eos> Very funny.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Where's your backpack?<eos> We love school!<eos> - Yes, we do.
Okay, guys.<eos> Ready for school?<eos> Nope.<eos> Ha-ha!<eos> Very funny.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Where's your backpack?<eos> We love school!<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> - No, we don't.
I have no right to be.<eos> Zoe, come on.<eos> It's so funny.<eos> It's so funny.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> What the hell am I doing here?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I mean...<eos> I think we both know the answer to that one.<eos> Yeah, do we?
This is crazy.<eos> What the hell am I doing here?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I mean...<eos> I think we both know the answer to that one.<eos> Yeah, do we?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Yeah, we...<eos> We know the answer?<eos> Yeah, we do.
I have two kids!<eos> I have a family.<eos> I can't.<eos> I want to have a family, too.<eos> With you.<eos> He changed the rules on me.<eos> He wasn't supposed to do that.<eos> He changed the rules?<eos> Okay.<eos> We both did.
Who is it?<eos> It's me, Mr. Smith.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Have you got a woman in there with you?<eos> What?<eos> Mr. Smith.<eos> What do you want?<eos> 'Cause if you have a woman in there with you, I have to charge you $20 extra for double occupancy.<eos> I don't have a woman in here. I'm just saying, if you do have a woman in there with you...<eos> Well, I don't.
Two men and a girl were staying in room 10.<eos> We found the two men down the road.<eos> Very dead.<eos> On the interstate? No.<eos> Down the road. I was wondering if you'd seen anything unusual around here tonight.<eos> - No, I didn't. - Mmm.<eos> We're looking for the girl.<eos> She's tall, attractive, in her 20's.<eos> Didn't happen to see her around here tonight, did you?<eos> No, I didn't.
All right.<eos> What did Bo Callahan do?<eos> Neither.<eos> He said that he'd read it, and then he didn't say anything.<eos> So?<eos> He didn't know about the $100 bill, Sonny.<eos> He lied.<eos> He never read the whole playbook.<eos> So?<eos> A lot of guys don't.
I'll stick with my draft picks.<eos> Yeah, but you want him, Tom, don't you?<eos> Seahawks fans want a hero and you denied 'em.<eos> - Not that bad.<eos> - Don't lie to me.<eos> I checked all the Seahawk fan blogs and chat rooms.<eos> They're all calling for your head.<eos> Ever since you traded away Callahan, the barbarians are at the gate.<eos> I don't care about that.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I fuck her from time to time.<eos> Does that make me her boyfriend?<eos> - Does around here.<eos> - She has a lot of boyfriends, I've heard.<eos> How many?<eos> You want me to confess to adultery?<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> Somebody beat her up.<eos> - Did she tell you I beat her up?<eos> - No, she didn't.
I'm in agreement with the Apaches on that score.<eos> The Apaches?<eos> The Apaches.<eos> The Arapaho.<eos> The Hunk papa Sioux.<eos> Not even one of Mum?<eos> Don't need a photograph to remember your mother.<eos> Memories fade.<eos> That's what's so terrible about them.<eos> No, they don't.
- OK?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thank you, Father.<eos> - You all right?<eos> Take your hands out of your pockets.<eos> Why?<eos> I heard you had a gun.<eos> I have to say I'm surprised. Thought I'd have to go looking for you.<eos> Just 'cause I'm here doesn't mean you have to go through with it.<eos> Yes it does!
COO of our Global Media Group.<eos> Are you interested?<eos> Are you kidding me? Absolutely.<eos> Great, I got a meeting with the board of directors this afternoon.<eos> Things could move fast.<eos> I need you settled in New York by the first of the month.<eos> Wait, New York?<eos> That is where our headquarters are located, Lauren.<eos> I got a good feeling about this.<eos> I did, too.
Hey, at least you got out.<eos> If they could put me back together, I'd go back today.<eos> For what?<eos> My unit.<eos> Listen, half of them are still over there.<eos> That don't make no sense.<eos> It's simple.<eos> Over there, who you are in the world don't matter.<eos> Fighting for your country don't matter.<eos> What does?
Straight to voicemail, go figure.<eos> So, Jack, refresh my memory.<eos> What is it you do?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> I bet you got a good answer.<eos> How do you know my name, Lewis?<eos> You told me.<eos> Yeah, you did. You told me... you said, "Jack Daniel, like the drink."<eos> And I said, "a damn good one at that."<eos> - No, I didn't.
It's my fucking time, Yuda.<eos> And I want my father to know that.<eos> - It won't be long now.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> When?<eos> Wait here.<eos> Hello?<eos> I've seen many a man fall before they should.<eos> They could have lasted a little longer had they known when to stop.<eos> But they don't.
She lives on your street.<eos> Amy's best friend.<eos> I've never heard the name Noelle Hawthorne.<eos> She and her husband have triplets.<eos> Yeah, we might say hi to them on the street.<eos> But "best friend"?<eos> No.<eos> Excuse me, one sec.<eos> He acted like Noelle was a complete stranger.<eos> Of course he did.
Hi.<eos> I don't even know how I got here.<eos> I don't know where any of my friends are and I need help!<eos> Is your room 1402?<eos> No, yeah...<eos> I don't know, why?<eos> We came back...<eos> Hmm... Men!<eos> They said they're friends of yours.<eos> Did they, now? !
You should take a long look at his ugly mug this morning.<eos> He's, actually, become a dear friend.<eos> You'll meet him, I hope.<eos> So. You've talked to Kovacs?<eos> I saw him last night in secret.<eos> He made me take an oath on a Bible I wouldn't tell a soul.<eos> - You're supposed to also.<eos> - I'll do that later.<eos> - He suspects you're innocent.<eos> - Of course he does.
Beth, I didn't.<eos> - I don't want to leave Fishy!<eos> - Ellie.<eos> - Let me go!<eos> - Ellie.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What have I done?<eos> Fish.<eos> You... you don't have power over me.<eos> You don't.
"Julia Roberts!<eos> "Julia Rob<eos> "Hurts<eos> "Cynthia!<eos> "Cynthia<eos> "You're dead You are dead<eos> "You're dead"<eos> That's for Cynthia, who's dead.<eos> I don't have a single lead.<eos> I do.
But there is also one other thing you have to consider,<eos> Cindy's condition.<eos> Those medical bills are going to pile up for years to come.<eos> What are you gettin' at?<eos> Come on, man, she doesn't have any insurance.<eos> I've been running those bills through the Embassy.<eos> How long you think that's gonna last?<eos> However, if she were a dependent of a government agent, well... That's a whole different ball game.<eos> So, you're sayin', if I take the job, you'll make sure Cindy's taken care of?<eos> But, what if I don't?
The defense calls...<eos> - Jimmy Logan to the stand. - What?<eos> In a surprise twist of events, a witness came forward today and ended the prosecution's case against Clinton Davis.<eos> The witness saw the victim, Cecil Ackerman, mowed down by a hit-and-run driver in a red S.U.V. And left on the road to die.<eos> He then called 911.<eos> It seems that Clinton Davis was not the only good samaritan in this trial.<eos> Mr. Davis?<eos> I just wanted to wish you all the best.<eos> Yeah, it's like you said-- if I was innocent, everything would work out.<eos> Yes, I did.
Stu, if I could explain this, I would.<eos> With what pathologists think were tools.<eos> The first took place eight months after Davis's family was tortured with similar tools.<eos> You see, I think he picked 'em.<eos> I think he picked all of them, but what the fuck do they all have in common?<eos> Well, Ackerman was a child molester.<eos> None of the others were.<eos> Well, they do all have criminal records.<eos> So you think this behavior started - with the death of his family, right?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Check the patient's kidneys.<eos> Could be in renal failure.<eos> That's good.<eos> So you can stay for the next surgery.<eos> I've got an angioplasty starting at 2:00.<eos> I actually have plans.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Does he know that this thing is gonna be ending in a couple of weeks?<eos> 'Cause the kid at dinner last night didn't really seem to know.<eos> Of course he does.
Yeah, we bought the place in '96, and the kids were just...<eos> A little poison ivy, a few too many mosquitoes, but I just love it.<eos> And you know, no matter what was happening in our lives, we could come out here because nothing would seem as bad.<eos> At least that was the idea.<eos> There's no need for any of this.<eos> You can just get to the point where you ask me about last night.<eos> Last night?<eos> You and that woman you work with.<eos> I don't know what you think you saw.<eos> I do.
What is your emergency?<eos> Hey. Um...<eos> I just saw some kids break into the zoo down on Lakeview.<eos> Mmm-hmm. Yes!<eos> Love is in the air, Davey.<eos> What's that smile for?<eos> I'm thinking of asking Sabine to marry me.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Yeah. Does Jade know?<eos> No one does.
Until it got stupid.<eos> But it was fun.<eos> Come on, man, we used to do shit like that all the time.<eos> Yeah, but back then I didn't have anything to lose.<eos> So, what, you're going to Brown now, too?<eos> Oh, great.<eos> You invited Jenny.<eos> How big do you think our houseboat is?<eos> She still cares about you, okay?<eos> We all do.
You can go.<eos> You'll be free.<eos> That'd be amazing. Yeah.<eos> Well?<eos> - No.<eos> - Then you die.<eos> And you'll never get the money.<eos> I think I'll liked the bite better.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, I did.
Cass!<eos> Cass!<eos> Cass!<eos> I have a plan.<eos> A few minutes.<eos> That's all you'll have together.<eos> Do I get to talk to him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Does my Dad get to talk to me?<eos> Yes, Cass he does.
Who are you fencing for?<eos> I ain't saying fucking shit!<eos> Then your name's on a dozen otherjobs just like it.<eos> - That's bullshit!<eos> - No. No, that's a promise.<eos> There's been a series of burglaries in the area all over the last six months.<eos> All still open.<eos> Now you don't talk to me, it's all on you, boy.<eos> Well, you know, I ain't got nothing to do with that.<eos> - Well, any idea who does?
Oh.<eos> Well, you'll be sleeping in Marie antoinette's bed.<eos> Oh, no, no. That's okay.<eos> She can have it.<eos> I'll just sleep on the floor.<eos> Oh, you are so funny.<eos> No, darling.<eos> Jay will have his room and you can stay in the guest room.<eos> I thought you quit.<eos> I did.
I did all the -- the cooking and the cleaning for my mother.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, give me that.<eos> Listen.<eos> You don't have to do any of that here.<eos> Okay?<eos> My mother said that this is how you earn love.<eos> Huh?<eos> I thought you didn't have any family.<eos> I don't.
May I?<eos> Well, I got to hand it to Jay. You're just...<eos> Not what I expected.<eos> Where did you guys meet?<eos> The hospital.<eos> Daisy, Jay wouldn't be working at a hospital unless there was a catch.<eos> Catch?<eos> Yes, a catch.<eos> And you know the catch.<eos> I do?
Can I ask you something?<eos> Did you kill your mother?<eos> Yes.<eos> Were there voices?<eos> Did voices tell you to do it?<eos> No.<eos> No, the voices -- they didn't tell me things.<eos> They told my mother things.<eos> So, you don't hear voices.<eos> Your mother did.
You didn't kill her.<eos> You didn't kill her.<eos> Why do I have to go back to the hospital then?<eos> I never wanted to take you back.<eos> That's not real though, is it?<eos> That's just pretend.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It is.<eos> I did want to take you back.<eos> I did.
What are you talking about?<eos> You know, I have an actual medical situation... where I can't actually physically have a child.<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> Do you know what I'm saying?<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> No, I mean, you didn't know.<eos> No, I didn't.
- ...and she could get that tumor removed.<eos> - Yes. Great.<eos> So, do I have to wake her before we move her to the new ship?<eos> Given that she's in hibernation, do I really have to... ask her permission? I'd hate to bother her.<eos> Plus... she is so slow-moving.<eos> It would be so much less of a headache... if we could ship her in her storage unit with our stuff.<eos> - No problem.<eos> - Oh, fantastic.<eos> You know, if it helps, my grandmother was in hibernation for five years.<eos> It doesn't.
I'm the first person to believe you having your past.<eos> I searched for your past.<eos> Nearly 20 years back, Inspector Maule joined that boy here.<eos> I too don't remember properly.<eos> I found alone him in the forest.<eos> He used to cry saying his parents were murdered.<eos> After inquiring, nothing like that.<eos> He is first boy to run away from our orphanage home.<eos> That's why I remembered him.<eos> But I didn't any proof.
Who are you?<eos> You are going to do this.<eos> Or I'm going to make your fucking life more miserable than it already is.<eos> I'll be back at noon. You be ready.<eos> Hold... hold still now.<eos> Oh, did it hurt, Ray?<eos> - Just get on with it, will you.<eos> Will you be needing a tissue?<eos> Are you done?<eos> Yeah, done.
There you got some cookies, chips, alright?<eos> Now, I'm going to take this tape off again.<eos> I really don't want to hear any screaming.<eos> Understand?<eos> Do you have any idea who our daddy is?<eos> He will come for us.<eos> Him and his friends.<eos> Then you'll be in trouble.<eos> - You're going to regret this.<eos> - I already do.
Come here.<eos> I'm thinking about leaving.<eos> Where would you go?<eos> Jamie says I can maybe stay with Frances for a few days... What the fuck, Adam?<eos> !<eos> Why are you messing around with Mooney Marks? I'm not messing around with Jamie...<eos> Call it what you want.<eos> I need to get away for a few days.<eos> You can't give him what he needs. How do you know what he needs?<eos> Oh, and you do?
[Brady] Why do you not eat vegetables, Taylor?<eos> - 'Cause I do not like them.<eos> - Why?<eos> - l don't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> 'Cause I don't.<eos> You just say you don't, but you don't have a reason.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - What's the reason?<eos> I don't.
Oh, man. I'm good, I'm good.<eos> Good to see you, brother.<eos> Meet a good friend of mine.<eos> Monica, meet Wesley Jonathan.<eos> Wesley Jonathan, Monica Moore.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I own all of your movies.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Yeah, Chicago says, uh, great things about you.<eos> He does? Mm-hmm.
He always orders water.<eos> Monica!<eos> Monica!<eos> Thanks for getting me out.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So, what are you going to do?<eos> About what?<eos> Monica, I like you.<eos> I really do.
- Fuck that mutt.<eos> - Make him sing for his supper. - Make him sing for his supper.<eos> - Freeloading bastard. - Chill, chill, chill.<eos> He's nothing to you. Fuck he's nothing to you.<eos> - Plug him in.<eos> See what happens. - Put him on the machine.<eos> - Plug him in. - Do it. See what happens.<eos> Push the button and kill us all.<eos> - Hook the dog up.<eos> - Do it.
Hogan.<eos> Bit late for Halloween, isn't it?<eos> What happened?<eos> Cleo.<eos> It happened last night.<eos> Cops were here.<eos> Wanted to talk to you.<eos> What am I gonna tell them?<eos> I don't know where I've been.<eos> I do.
- Don't say it.<eos> - She's just another alter.<eos> Shut up!<eos> She created you to deal with the shrinks and the suits... and all their bureaucratic bullshit.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Suki is just a puppet imitating human behavior.<eos> - I know who I am, Hogan.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> None of us do.
Mary Bee Cuddy. Was her name.<eos> Oh what a... terrible loss.<eos> She must have been a fine brave human being.<eos> She truly was.<eos> They've ridden all this way in that box?<eos> O Mercy!<eos> Well...it's time to meet them.<eos> I'm not sure I'm ready.<eos> You must have had an awful winter.<eos> We did, ma'am.
Yeah.<eos> I understand.<eos> Does anyone want cream?<eos> No thanks, I'm good.<eos> Your friend Sheila still come around?<eos> I don't know what we're gonna do with all the food.<eos> So...<eos> Honey, do you mind?<eos> I want to know.<eos> No, really, you don't.
Arkady Federov!<eos> Edgar.<eos> Alice, what are you doing here?<eos> You alright?<eos> What happened to you at the restaurant?<eos> I decided to tell you everything I know about Arkady Federov.<eos> Come in.<eos> You know he's in town right now, the European Energy Conference.<eos> Staying at the Imperia Hotel.<eos> No, I didn't.
I just gotta delete my messages.<eos> How many?<eos> Nice.<eos> No, not all of these are from me.<eos> Two are from her mother.<eos> Hey. Sorry to take so long, but Jason had another meltdown.<eos> He's a mess of a human.<eos> I hope he's okay.<eos> Oh, he'll bounce back.<eos> He always does.
And I promised myself, "I'll kill anyone who hurts her."<eos> I didn't care about my mother...<eos> And hated my father.<eos> Soichi told me you mean the world to him.<eos> That kid's not so different after all.<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> Like I said, he really loves you.<eos> But you tried to kill him.<eos> - I didn't...<eos> - Yes, you did.
Just blind side me like this without any warning or anything?<eos> - It just seems crazy.<eos> - It's hard to take in, you know.<eos> - It's trauma.<eos> Trauma is...<eos> - Will you shut the fuck up.<eos> - You know, you need to...<eos> - You gotta shut the fuck up. Okay?<eos> I don't wanna do this.<eos> I do.
I mean, did she break your heart or did you, you know, did you break hers?<eos> Oh, I... I don't know.<eos> She was seeing someone.<eos> Hey, did you and your husband, did you fight?<eos> God, yeah.<eos> Yes.<eos> Mark, my... my first husband... he tried to... kill me more than once.<eos> And I have a restraining order against him.<eos> I mean, I still...<eos> I still do.
I was just freaking out or something in the mountains.<eos> - I run a little hot and cold.<eos> - Yeah, just a little.<eos> You know, it's... it was no big deal.<eos> We didn't know each other very well and... you know, maybe we shouldn't have...<eos> No, I do that sometimes when I'm overwhelmed.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But I prayed about it... and... I really enjoyed myself... in the mountains with you. Good.<eos> I did too for the most part.
She dropped her sex toy in your car.<eos> - Annie... - No!<eos> I'm not exposing my daughter to that.<eos> - Come on.<eos> She wasn't exposed to anything.<eos> - And I...<eos> I'm sorry to have to tell you... that I'm going to talk to my lawyer about the joint custody.<eos> I am. I...<eos> I never thought that you were this kind of man.<eos> I didn't.
Yes, please.<eos> Thanks for coming over<eos> Cheers -Cheers<eos> You look stressed.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> Stuart and I... we've tried everything.<eos> Therapy, counseling, together, separately<eos> He wants it to work.<eos> He really does.
See if we can find out what's going on.<eos> Just came in, its a nerves.<eos> Lets go then.<eos> Follow me.<eos> So, what's this about?<eos> - Some guy offed his ex.<eos> - Allegedly<eos> Right.<eos> Allegedly<eos> - He didn't do her in the car, did he?
But your not<eos> Your not.<eos> This we can't recommend<eos> I can't start trying to make sense of what happened<eos> Someone killed my mom.<eos> That's what happened<eos> It was not my father<eos> We haven't heard his side of the story<eos> They can't know that can they?<eos> I do.
Did you fuck him?<eos> I told him it was too dangerous.<eos> That's my girl.<eos> Goodnight, Sam.<eos> Right. Remember, stick together, stay in contact.<eos> And if you have to shoot, shoot their legs, OK?<eos> Yo?<eos> Someone called a faulty monitor?<eos> - It wasn't me, mate.<eos> - Well, someone did, mate.
A quiet meadow.<eos> Time for a little rest.<eos> Amber's certainly taking it easy.<eos> This is one cub who really likes staying close to mom.<eos> But Scout acts like he's too old to be carried around.<eos> Bear rides are for babies.<eos> Scout can't believe what he is seeing.<eos> "Other bears?"<eos> "There are other bears in the world?" "Did everybody know that?"<eos> Sky did.
I was just out having a good time.<eos> Come on.<eos> POLICE DISPATCHER: (OVER RADIO) 1 2th Street crack house.<eos> Shots fired. Three black males. One Caucasian female in a yellow dress.<eos> Do you believe this?<eos> Maybe it's some other white chick in a yellow dress.<eos> Whoa. You saw this lady?<eos> You've got to go talk to the Lieutenant.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Don't call this number again, motherfucker.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> I didn't see you there.<eos> You're Meghan miles, that channel Six News lady.<eos> ¤En vivo!<eos> En vivo.<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> It's a Iong story.<eos> You don't have $5, do you?<eos> In the store, I do.
Okay. Does the $1 .50 need to be paid at every stop?<eos> Are you for serious?<eos> I am for serious.<eos> Do you take credit cards?<eos> Yeah, you can swipe it right there.<eos> really?<eos> That is an amazing innovative technology that you can just...<eos> Do you take debit cards?<eos> Do you have a debit card?<eos> I do not.
Do you see what I'm laying down? Do you see what I'm putting down?<eos> I'm putting that down.<eos> Are you trying to bribe me?<eos> No.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> Because I was thinking I might want Quiznos for lunch today.<eos> How much?<eos> $500.<eos> Quiznos does not cost $500.<eos> It does for me.
So, you have an idiot friend, too?<eos> Yeah, mine's by choice.<eos> I mean, you got stuck with this guy, right?<eos> We have her, Iet's move!<eos> (GASPS) (ALL GASPING) Oh, my God, honey!<eos> There's too much to do.<eos> DAN: Move. Come on, get on the chair.<eos> Hurry up. WOMAN:<eos> Triage.<eos> Just do the upper line.
You know, that's so interesting. Because my husband and I spent an entire summer in Montclair...<eos> - Stay away from dead people.<eos> - You scared the shit outta me!<eos> Well, at least I didn't say that he died.<eos> But he did die. And you know he died. And the moment that thought enters your head you start...<eos> - Okay, okay. Can we not talk about Eugene.<eos> - I'm sorry I brought it up.<eos> I don't understand why I have to talk in-between songs.<eos> - Because people want to get to know you.<eos> - People don't really...
You're the one on the way to London.<eos> You are a one who has not been home since Christmas.<eos> I have school.<eos> And I have a job.<eos> I just feel like she's always trying to shove it down my throat.<eos> I know...<eos> look, I know that this past year, has been something of an adjustment, but...<eos> She is your mother, and I think it'd be good if you, no, if we both... Could be a little more supportive.<eos> - You missed her...<eos> - Yes, I do.
No, you're not.<eos> She's better off without me.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> No, no!<eos> Please don't! Please, do not!<eos> Maybe, the world is better off without me.<eos> You need to listen to me now, do not do this.<eos> You can't just give up on her.<eos> Do you have children, Mr. Williams?<eos> No, I don't.
Do all what?<eos> Practice, the road, making records.<eos> Starting a family.<eos> I ain't starting nothing.<eos> Except what we doing.<eos> Bobby, we in there.<eos> All them little grooves.<eos> That's us.<eos> That's all the money we got.<eos> And some we don't.
- We're going there.<eos> - Have our likeness taken.<eos> - When?<eos> - Thursday.<eos> I've arranged an appointment.<eos> - Well, you'll have to cancel it.<eos> - 'Tis painless.<eos> Oh, I care not.<eos> You don't want my old face in one of these.<eos> I do, the two of us together.
- Yes, sir. Get that scope back up!<eos> Hey, look at them run.<eos> Hey, look at them run.<eos> Y'all see that shit?<eos> Smile for the camera, Brick.<eos> Now you're in.<eos> Frankie, that's 37 for you, baby, that's 37.<eos> Why did the locals attack the base?<eos> I thought the inter-human conflict ended in this region after the Heavies invaded.<eos> It did.
Yeah, I'd say so.<eos> Is that why you took it upon yourself to bury him?<eos> No.<eos> Why did you do it then?<eos> HQ. said we had to keep his death classified.<eos> But he still deserved a proper burial.<eos> How did you know how to give him an Islamic burial?<eos> Know your enemy.<eos> If you believe in God, now's the time to pray.<eos> And if you don't...
Grandma's room's right there, boys.<eos> So I signed the discharge papers.<eos> I thought that might help.<eos> "Help" would be taking her in yourself, Ian.<eos> No, that would not be.<eos> That would be martyrdom.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a room.<eos> You told me she had a private room.<eos> She did, at first.
I probably have the same faith as John here.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> We'll be asking the questions here, wise guy.<eos> Do you have faith, John?<eos> We've both lost loved ones.<eos> How would your daughter feel if she had no father and she was all alone?<eos> - That's it.<eos> - John.<eos> - I know about you.<eos> - You do?
I did it!<eos> Stop them, you imbeciles.<eos> They're six-inch fairies!<eos> Fawn, the wheel!<eos> Sil, whirlwind!<eos> Take that!<eos> Blast it.<eos> The second star!<eos> They turned the ship around!<eos> Yup, we sure did.
By all means, bring your food.<eos> Sh.. Mm-hmm.<eos> Hello, I'm Arielle's husband, Valery.<eos> Enchante.<eos> Enchante.<eos> Please forgive any hot dog related moisture.<eos> Only if you will forgive my intrusion.<eos> I... I thought we should meet.<eos> Arielle speaks very highly of you.<eos> She does?
He loves your voice.<eos> Loves!<eos> He wants you to start a novel.<eos> He wants to publish you.<eos> He... he never says that.<eos> He hates everything.<eos> He just wants to meet you for one minute first and make sure that you're not a lunatic...<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> She brought Valery.<eos> Of course, she did.
You don't need antidepressants, because you're not clinically depressed.<eos> You're grieving.<eos> There's a world of difference.<eos> Not just for your father.<eos> When I was in the second grade I liked to gross boys out by eating flies and ants.<eos> Even a daddy longlegs once.<eos> In junior high I stopped taking showers.<eos> My mom would say, Why do you want to treat your body with such disrespect?"<eos> I had no idea why.<eos> But now I do.
Yeah.<eos> I can come back.<eos> Oh, no, I think we're done.<eos> Right?<eos> Are we done?<eos> Ten minutes ago.<eos> Nice to see you.<eos> Good morning.<eos> It could be said that we got off to a poor start at the wine and cheese event.<eos> "We" did?

Don't blame this on me, Jed.<eos> You did this.<eos> Don't blame this on me!<eos> I did this, and I'm glad I did this.<eos> I'm glad I didn't have to jump through 15,000 hoops or build a chapel, Rose, to do it.<eos> She wants me.<eos> Me!<eos> Because she doesn't know you, Jed.<eos> - She does.<eos> - No, she doesn't!
Alice... have a message.<eos> Have a message<eos> Who is it?<eos> Mom...<eos> Dad.<eos> Hi honey... heard a noise and woke and now I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> I will.<eos> Pa '... Are you afraid of the dark?<eos> No. Of course not.<eos> Why, do you?
I don't know shit about football.<eos> Eventually, I started missing some bets.<eos> Actually, the third week, I fucking missed everything.<eos> I mean, I got fucking buried.<eos> I was losing everything I put in.<eos> Went down 25,000.<eos> So I tried to be scarce.<eos> Fall off the radar a minute.<eos> I tried to avoid these pricks.<eos> Honest to God, I did. I did.
- You did not tell me anything.<eos> - You did not ask!<eos> Sorry.<eos> I will study there.<eos> It's like you and Willow Springs.<eos> What do we do then?<eos> How?<eos> I want to continue with you.<eos> I want to make sure that it works.<eos> Of course you do!
You gotta be kidding.<eos> We haven't even started yet and you're asking a question? Hey, hey.<eos> That is not how this works.<eos> We ask the questions, we do the talking, you do the listening.<eos> Okay, but I'm serious. I have a question.<eos> Just one.<eos> Jesus Christ, ask the fucking question before our pensions run out, for Christ's sake.<eos> What if I win?<eos> Listen. Ten years of playing poker night, rookie's never won, never will.<eos> Okay, but if I do.
I'm gonna use the outhouse. Um...<eos> If I die out there, will you guys just do me one favor?<eos> Just once, I want you to switch seats.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Ah, Edward, hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Albert, you look terrible!<eos> Oh, wow, there's that confidence boost I need. Thanks a lot.<eos> How you doing, buddy?
And I want you to have that.<eos> Edward, this is your lucky handkerchief.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's sticky.<eos> Well, hello to you, too!<eos> James, I found the friendly locals.<eos> So he said, "Why don't you go blow your own horse?"<eos> Hey, watch it, pal.<eos> I think you owe me a drink, fella.<eos> The hell I do.
We're not with Carson.<eos> We're just thirsty.<eos> Carson hit our farm some time back.<eos> Folks thought he'd help them.<eos> We're the only ones that survived.<eos> Our well's been long dry.<eos> And we had a good store of water until they ran it into the ground.<eos> We held on a week before moving on.<eos> Every well we've come to in this valley's been dry.<eos> You done?
I love you, baby.<eos> Hey, knock when you come back.<eos> So I know it's you.<eos> Help me!<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm going to do it again and again until you make them remember.<eos> I think I need to tell someone.<eos> Well, you just did.
- Thirty years.<eos> And then Benjamin Sewell died, Ms. Lerner.<eos> He died last summer. In a hospital in Fort Worth.<eos> I spoke to a nurse that worked at the hospital, since before Benjamin died...<eos> - Come on, we don't have time for this. - Hold on.<eos> She said a young man used to visit him.<eos> His son, they thought. What if it's him?<eos> That the passing of his father set him off and he came back here to finish his father's work?<eos> Benjamin Sewell did have a son, Ms. Lerner, but he died in a bar fight two years ago.<eos> He did?
"Fuck you.<eos> Don't put me on the spot."<eos> "Don't make me feel self-conscious about my marriage<eos> "while my wife is sitting..."<eos> Right there.<eos> "...right there."<eos> Can I sit down for this?<eos> Yeah, sit. Good idea.<eos> So just give it to me as a "Fuck you." Lay it on me.<eos> Just do it.
- Who else do you keep in touch with from home?<eos> - Oh, just my close friends.<eos> You know, my homies.<eos> What about you?<eos> - No one, really.<eos> It's weird, you know, sometimes it feels like you have so many friends one minute, and then you leave home and you're basically all alone.<eos> - It's hard to picture you as not popular.<eos> - I mean, I have friends...<eos> - And now you have me.<eos> - I do, do I?
Um, what are you doing here?<eos> I'm just organizing Beth's stuff, you know.<eos> - Her stuffed animals and...<eos> Pictures.<eos> I really didn't take enough pictures.<eos> So foolish.<eos> Eating Jell-O.<eos> Oh, we used to eat Jell-O all the time when Beth was little.<eos> We ate a lot of Jell-O.<eos> Yeah, we did.
No, but my daughter is in your freshman Biology class.<eos> Rachel Whitaker.<eos> Ah Rachel.<eos> She's a pleasure to have in class.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Professor Kaman, I don't mean to come off so direct or with any disrespect, but I'm concerned about what you're teaching in your class.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Can you give me an example?<eos> Well, it seems your class deals quite a bit with the subject of evolution.<eos> Yes it does.
Professor Kaman, I don't mean to come off so direct or with any disrespect, but I'm concerned about what you're teaching in your class.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Can you give me an example?<eos> Well, it seems your class deals quite a bit with the subject of evolution.<eos> Yes it does.<eos> Can you explain to me why you teach only evolution?<eos> Sure, but first let me ask you Mr. Whitaker, are you a religious man?<eos> A religious man?<eos> Well you believe in God and the Bible.<eos> Yes sir I do.
Yes it does.<eos> Can you explain to me why you teach only evolution?<eos> Sure, but first let me ask you Mr. Whitaker, are you a religious man?<eos> A religious man?<eos> Well you believe in God and the Bible.<eos> Yes sir I do.<eos> And does that help you?<eos> Help me?<eos> Does that help you to be at peace with yourself?<eos> Yes it does.
Hey.<eos> I set up a meeting with Professor Kaman to do that interview.<eos> Did you talk to that father yet?<eos> Oh no, I was getting ready to call him.<eos> Before you do, I think you should check this out.<eos> What?<eos> Professor Kaman was in the news yesterday.<eos> Front page story.<eos> We didn't run a story on Kaman yesterday.<eos> Yeah, well we did twelve years ago.
Great.<eos> More pressure.<eos> Look, I got some material in the car with good information on science from a Biblical perspective, I'll give it to you.<eos> Thanks. Appreciate it.<eos> We can sit here.<eos> You seem pretty serious about this.<eos> Maybe you should be the one debating Kaman.<eos> God didn't give me the opportunity sir.<eos> He gave it to you and I think what you're doing is great.<eos> Rachel sure doesn't.
God created the chicken first, just like the Bible says, and then set it up so that life could reproduce itself.<eos> Kaman doesn't believe in God so he teaches the opposite.<eos> Come on Evan.<eos> You're not helping. Just answer me this one question.<eos> Did God create this world or did it come about through evolution like Kaman says?<eos> Evan.<eos> Just answer the question, please?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not going to answer that.<eos> You just did.
You have supporters.<eos> Just makes it tough when I know Rachel's not one of them.<eos> Thanks Evan, I'll talk to you later.<eos> Alright bye.<eos> Hey, I'll catch up with you later.<eos> Uh, excuse me, your Dad's the guy that's gonna debate Kaman, right?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I'm in your Bio class.<eos> Why would anybody wanna debate Kaman?<eos> He doesn't.
After three years of<eos> Filming, Dan had music<eos> In 56 homes.<eos> We knew this was just a drop in The bucket.<eos> Just changing Something in a nursing home Somewhere doesn't take you<eos> Our real focus of concern needs To be the 1.6 million people who Are living in nursing homes and<eos> I thought this was just Going to be... pshew!<eos> Just like that.<eos> People would just take the idea And run with it.<eos> They didn't.
I wish she liked us more.<eos> - Aw baby, she loves you more than anything.<eos> - That's so stupid, so typical, I mean what else are you supposed to say?<eos> - I wish we could have one morning in this house, one breakfast without you guys bickering, bickering, bickering, always got to complain about something.<eos> Mama's not perfect, mama's not perfect.<eos> Guess what?<eos> You're not perfect either.<eos> - High-class chef cuisine people on a budget.<eos> Want to go through some of the selections?<eos> - I sure do. -
I refused.<eos> I was there to teach, I thought.<eos> Then the girl accused me of not doing my part as a woman, and I was arrested and put in a holding cell for two weeks.<eos> How did you get out?<eos> They knew I wasn't going to change my mind.<eos> So they let me out.<eos> They wouldn't have liked my cooking anyway.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because I didn't know how to cook.<eos> I still don't.
There was two of them.<eos> One got away.<eos> Why didn't you shoot him?<eos> It jammed.<eos> Oh, for fuck's sake.<eos> - What are youse fucking doing?<eos> - What you're supposed to be doing.<eos> There was an agreement.<eos> D'you understand the shite this is going to bring down on us now?<eos> Do you?
- It wasn't us.<eos> - So who was it?<eos> - It wasn't you, no?<eos> - No.<eos> - You sure about that?<eos> - Of course I'm fucking sure.<eos> So where the fuck have you been all day?<eos> We were driving about looking for that other soldier.<eos> I told you to stand down.<eos> Well, we didn't.
Right.<eos> So beautiful, Kate.<eos> Really.<eos> Just wonderful writing.<eos> It's hot.<eos> Which one is your favorite?<eos> I don't have a favorite.<eos> It's like me with my painting.<eos> I don't have a favorite either.<eos> George does.
It's not.<eos> It's not.<eos> - It is.<eos> I mean, I...<eos> Yeah, I was upset that you were not answering my calls, but I...<eos> I didn't want to die.<eos> What?<eos> Well, I mean, I...<eos> I thought I did.<eos> I did.
Listen, you guys?<eos> This here feels kind of wrong.<eos> I thought we'd agreed not to discuss work on the way to school.<eos> - Wasn't that what we agreed?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Did you remember the fruit?<eos> He's supposed to have five different kinds of organic fruit and veg daily.<eos> Didn't we talk about this?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes, we did.
The wrecks at sundown.<eos> Once he sees the pouch with the seal unbroken, he will hand over the page.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> It's unclear which is more appealing, your beauty or your intelligence.<eos> You are very kind, monsieur.<eos> Well, let's not get carried away.<eos> You.<eos> Is there a problem, Captain?<eos> She doesn't have your page.<eos> Flint does.
Yeah, Dada.<eos> No.<eos> Stop.<eos> Dada.<eos> - Dada!<eos> - Dada!<eos> No, I'm not his...<eos> I'm not your Dada.<eos> Dum Dum got a new son-son!<eos> No, he doesn't.
I know.<eos> I didn't really know you were coming home early.<eos> Yeah, that's pretty obvious.<eos> I mean... what makes you think this is okay?<eos> When I'm not at Mom's you leave me alone, like, every night.<eos> Look, you can't be doing this right now.<eos> You got finals, your NYU application is due in what, two weeks?<eos> I'm not gonna get into NYU.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
I'm confused, because there's not a list...<eos> Dad?<eos> Mmm-hmm?<eos> I want to take a year off.<eos> I would like to do exactly what you just said.<eos> I want to spread my wings.<eos> You want to spread your wings, that's great.<eos> But you can't spread your wings and fly to nowhere.<eos> Plans change.<eos> No, they don't.
Yeah.<eos> Let's cut to the point.<eos> As the crow flies, y'all are wanting to ask about that big throwdown in the woods, yeah?<eos> Eventually, sure.<eos> Right now, we're just trying to track the case.<eos> How Cohle worked it, especially.<eos> Which indicates you think I'm too thick to realize that y'all are trying to jam somebody up.<eos> You're on to something new.<eos> So Cohle didn't want to give it to the task force.<eos> Did you?

Can I hold him?<eos> Please?<eos> Why isn't he crying?<eos> Follow me.<eos> You...<eos> You knew the baby was gonna be a stillborn.<eos> I knew.<eos> He was an innocent.<eos> Why would God kill all these people and an innocent baby?<eos> He didn't.
- Really, really, really good.<eos> - Right.<eos> - I did you a birthday card, Granddad.<eos> - Oh, thanks, Lottie.<eos> She's got something of your mother.<eos> - Can he not play with that?<eos> - Oh, Mickey!<eos> Sorry, I just wanted to show Granddad the badger in the revolving doors and the nun with two heads.<eos> Nobody wants to see a nun with two heads.<eos> - I do.
Yes, sir.<eos> I don't suppose that's ready, is it? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - It is?<eos> Philip, you want to take this home for the kids?<eos> Uh, can you just wrap two slices?<eos> And then, uh, you and Barb can split the rest.<eos> Uh, my roommate is on a diet.<eos> He'd kill me if I bring home cake.<eos> You had a good couple of months.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Circle one and put it in the box. I suggest Julien does the count with me.<eos> That suits me.<eos> Does everyone agree?<eos> Happy now you've stirred up the shit?<eos> Friday's ballot was enough.<eos> You shouldn't have scared them so they'd vote against me.<eos> What are you implying?<eos> You told some of them if I wasn't laid off, they would be.<eos> I never said that.<eos> You did.
It was cops everywhere that night.<eos> He-- he got out.<eos> I haven't seen him since.<eos> He got out?<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> He got out.<eos> There was no way he was getting through that roadblock.<eos> And where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No one does.
What time is it?<eos> Midnight.<eos> Oh, fuck, Jason!<eos> All right, before you get really worked up, I've already thought this through. Look at the GPS.<eos> We're here, heading south of Los Angeles. Now, Nardo is here, 14 miles south of the Mexican border. Okay?<eos> Two and half hours down, that puts Nardo in the car at 2:30 a.m. Then three hours back up to Los Angeles, that puts us in L.A. at 5:30 a.m.<eos> Your meeting's at 8:00, right? Yeah. Okay?<eos> Then we have two and a half hours of flex time.<eos> You could have at least brought me something to wear.<eos> I did.
No, you don't.<eos> If you liked me, you never would've let Jason go through with that.<eos> Fine.<eos> You know what?<eos> I should've stopped him.<eos> Okay?<eos> I guess I didn't because part of me thought that Jason might've been right about you.<eos> But things are different now.<eos> I never knew how much Nardo loved you.<eos> But I do now.
You two are friends?<eos> Fast friends.<eos> BFFs. If both Miss Jetson and the court agree not to press charges, Veronica's free to go.<eos> The court is only involved if there's an intent to commit a crime.<eos> There wasn't.<eos> So the BE is considered an illegal trespass, a misdemeanor... leaving the charges entirely in the hands of the victim, I.e., Ruby, I.e., my BFF.<eos> What she said.<eos> So, girlfriend, what are you up to?<eos> Where I come from, they just say "thank you."<eos> No, they don't.
Farewell, my concubine.<eos> - And I'll take a Bud.<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> - And an Old Grand-Dad.<eos> The bourbon.<eos> Not some old guy.<eos> Words With Friends?<eos> Some people just call it texting.<eos> I wanna ask you about the night Susan Knight died.<eos> Heh. Of course you do.
I'm here with you.<eos> I do not know how to forgive.<eos> Just say it out loud.<eos> I... I forgive... I forgive you.<eos> MacKenzie, you're a blessing.<eos> I'm still angry.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> No one gets over it.<eos> Maybe I have to forgive a thousand times Until it gets easier.<eos> But it will.
Wait for Bakuto to leave the building, then we take him down.<eos> I'm not losing my family to the Hand again. - Danny.<eos> - I'm the Iron Fist.<eos> You don't tell me what to do.<eos> I'm gonna get you through this.<eos> Here. Compress these on both sides of the wound.<eos> - And this should help with the pain.<eos> - Let me get her to a hospital.<eos> Danny said he's coming.<eos> He will.
you're not the first friend of mine with special powers.<eos> I couldn't help but notice that you had this... sweet innocence. the darker you become.<eos> I can win any fight!<eos> some shit you just can't punch.<eos> You know you weren't given this gift so that you could commit murder.<eos> And I know that you think but it's not.<eos> Danny.<eos> You can't kill Harold.<eos> I can.<eos> And I will.
Now my car won't start!<eos> It'll be fine.<eos> Anne and I will have a nice talk, I'll fix her a glass of tea and you need to get on back to work.<eos> I'll tell ya, you need to keep your job and thank goodness Mrs. Jones and I are good friends.<eos> Mom, my car won't start.<eos> Here, take my car.<eos> It's gonna be okay, okay?<eos> Alright.<eos> Just talk to Anne please.<eos> I will.
Stop saying that.<eos> We're hiring a hundred people this month.<eos> - One of them may as well be you.<eos> - Right, good.<eos> This doesn't mean you're in.<eos> You have to kill the interview.<eos> Know the Circle inside out.<eos> I'm back next week.<eos> By then, you'll be hired if you kill the interview.<eos> Okay, I will.
Children often get caught halfway between fantasy and... and reality.<eos> And he's only six.<eos> And I asked him if the two of you talk much about his father.<eos> He said it upset you and that you're not saying much about him.<eos> Yeah, it's very complicated, so...<eos> He said that be aware that if we're talking to my mom about my dad, that she's gonna get a funny look on her face.<eos> So I take it that Ziggy's father isn't exactly a good guy.<eos> No, not exactly.<eos> And I assume that Ziggy's never met him.<eos> Yeah, no, he never will.
No.<eos> We think you do.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Come on, I'll take you home.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> What else am I gonna do?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
I cost a girl her life because I was afraid to love her.<eos> You can't love someone back to life.<eos> You can try.<eos> Clay... we don't know what was in her mind or in her heart.<eos> There's no way to know why she did what she did.<eos> Actually, there is a way.<eos> Before she died... Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.<eos> And you're number 13.<eos> And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.<eos> And they always will.
You've blinded me!<eos> The little girl saw her chance to escape.<eos> When she reached the door, she couldn't believe her eyes. The stepmother was holding a huge stick to beat her with.<eos> Why doesn't my dad go and bash the stepmother?<eos> He can't.<eos> He's away at the war.<eos> Then I want to go too.<eos> Really?<eos> But then who will look after me?<eos> I will, Mummy.
That's all we know for sure.<eos> How do we shut him down?<eos> What's up?<eos> What's the issue?<eos> There were some irregularities during his interview.<eos> Evasiveness.<eos> - About?<eos> - A one-year gap on his résumé.<eos> How did he explain it?<eos> He won't.
You've changed so much.<eos> You're all grown up.<eos> - Well, where's the famous boyfriend?<eos> - That's enough.<eos> - He's a friend.<eos> - Yes, sorry.<eos> The friend.<eos> Where is he?<eos> - Dad, don't say anything.<eos> - I won't.
I'm not good at building shit, you know?<eos> I'm excellent at tearing it down.<eos> Oh, rookie move.<eos> What the...?<eos> - It's already cheese.<eos> - It's cheese on cheese.<eos> See?<eos> You know, sometimes you gotta play to your strengths.<eos> - You should stitch that on a pillow.<eos> - Oh, I will.
If he says he's gonna rescue Madzie, we need to be here when he comes back.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But at what point do we say he's been gone too long?<eos> We don't.<eos> Okay?<eos> Hey...<eos> If I don't make it...<eos> Stop.<eos> You will.
You said my mother didn't care about me.<eos> But she kept these things...<eos> It was foolish sentimentality. Nothing more.<eos> Your mother feared you.<eos> She wanted you dead.<eos> My sister's different. Yes.<eos> She is.<eos> I'm glad you had a chance to meet Clarissa, spend some time with her.<eos> So you're... you're acting like I'll never see her again.<eos> Of course you will.
What's wrong? Is everything OK?<eos> That was Luke.<eos> Valentine's on his way to Idris.<eos> - What?<eos> - How?<eos> He made a deal with the Seelie Queen.<eos> Luke's warned all the other Downworld leaders.<eos> Damn Valentine.<eos> If Valentine gets to that lake...<eos> He won't.
So if it's all the same to you...<eos> All right.<eos> You don't have to come, Julian.<eos> - You don't even know Harry.<eos> - Come on. A chance to travel to another dimension... I mean, I wasn't gonna miss that.<eos> We're not going sightseeing.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> Well, damn.<eos> All right, Jesse, Wally, you make sure this city's safe while I'm gone, all right?<eos> We will.
We weren't engaged yet.<eos> So you thought that if we were...<eos> That it might change the future.<eos> Iris...<eos> Iris, wait.<eos> Iris, hey. Come on.<eos> Hey, hey, I love you, okay?<eos> I love you more than anything.<eos> That part has never changed.<eos> It never will.
I'll take that bet.<eos> Give him a little ride.<eos> With pleasure.<eos> Okay, that's new.<eos> He can't move.<eos> They're using their powers at the same time.<eos> - What are we gonna do?<eos> - Can't he phase or something?<eos> - That doesn't work on these guys.<eos> - Well, what will?
You know how stubborn she can get.<eos> It doesn't change the fact that...<eos> You guys know that I'm right here, yeah?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you feeling? Fine.<eos> Lucifer, I told you no hospitals.<eos> How am I supposed to find the antidote if I'm laying here...<eos> We'll take it from here. Yes.<eos> Yes, we will.
I'm sorry I dragged you into all this.<eos> You should be at home with your husband.<eos> Pretending like everything is fine in this town?<eos> I talked to Chief and we have a plan for Megan's... situation.<eos> Mark, you know, was fired from the department, and, uh... we're gonna say he killed himself.<eos> Yeah, I don't like it, but it... makes sense, I guess. And it clears Megan.<eos> No fucking way.<eos> Megan!<eos> I won't have you disgrace Mark's memory by saying he abandoned his family.<eos> I won't.

Nothing. That's the problem.<eos> I-I don't have anything for her.<eos> They'd already ID'd Broussard and the rest of the cell.<eos> I'm out of time.<eos> You're an asset.<eos> She's running you.<eos> She wants Broussard.<eos> - So give him to her.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - You won't.
Whatever.<eos> Just sounds in general.<eos> Why did I come here to see you?<eos> That's right.<eos> The retirement papers.<eos> Sign 'em, Handsome.<eos> You're not fooling anybody.<eos> And by the way, my tubes are tied.<eos> You gotta fix this door.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Well, as long as you don't drop the line, I'm squared away.<eos> I'm not gonna drop... square...<eos> Oh, that was... that was you trying to be funny, right?<eos> Like a joke?<eos> - Uh-huh. - Yeah.<eos> Feel that, though. - Ow.<eos> Man. - Ooh.<eos> My bad.<eos> Billy, don't leave me again.<eos> I won't.
I mean, everyone close to me in my life is in a happy relationship, and I thought I could have that, too.<eos> But... I'm starting to think that maybe it's just not in the cards for me.<eos> No.<eos> Take it from a woman who has been married four times.<eos> Four?<eos> Well, it would've been five, but I turned down Rob Lowe. Twice, actually.<eos> It just feels like this pain isn't gonna go away.<eos> Ah, well, that's what I said about childbirth.<eos> But it did.<eos> And it will.
What was He like?<eos> What did God look like?<eos> What was He doing here?<eos> Let me ask you a question, Preacher.<eos> What do you want from Him?<eos> We just have a few questions.<eos> "Questions." The arrogance.<eos> God won't answer them.<eos> - He might.<eos> - No, He won't.
At a terrible price.<eos> You're the one who taught me that earth must come first.<eos> And Eros?<eos> A hundred thousand souls.<eos> Did I teach you that?<eos> If I had known what was going to happen on Eros, I would have stopped the project and Jules-Pierre mao along with it and you know that!<eos> Eros nearly destroyed this planet.<eos> You will have to answer for your part in that.<eos> I know...<eos> And I will.
This is chilled cucumber soup.<eos> It's a recipe that I learned in Egypt, where I was briefly employed as a snake charmer.<eos> Our father lived in Egypt before we were born. - Is that when you...<eos> - I don't talk about that.<eos> - When we were living with Uncle Monty...<eos> - I said I don't talk about that.<eos> - But there was a statue...<eos> - Klaus, I said I don't talk about that.<eos> You don't talk about that?<eos> Or you won't?
The only person you get that torn up over is Kara.<eos> Plus, the glasses don't help.<eos> I always said that too.<eos> It's kind of ridiculous.<eos> I'm... I'm glad that you know.<eos> Because I don't, I don't want there to be any secrets.<eos> Bad stuff happens.<eos> In our line of work, it happens all the time.<eos> How do I know you're not gonna run next time it does?<eos> I won't.
And what's a Shark Tank?<eos> Well, it's clear that my current prototypes aren't strong enough.<eos> And I need upgraded models.<eos> That's where you two come in.<eos> Perfect specimens.<eos> Not sure how much power I'm going to need.<eos> I might have to drain our little battery completely to pull it off.<eos> But you two are worth it.<eos> We will never fight for you.<eos> You will.
Why?<eos> You know you can't stop me from leaving.<eos> And you know you can't stop me from chasing after you.<eos> And you know how fast I am.<eos> But if you spare him, if you do that much, maybe I'll wait to chase you until after he's in jail.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Just us girls next time.<eos> We can braid each other's hair.<eos> We can still catch her.<eos> I will.
Brother, please remember, the plan tonight is to create a false sense of security.<eos> A little music, a little champagne, some stealthy reconnaissance. No bloodshed.<eos> Do we understand each other?<eos> They threatened me, they threatened my child.<eos> Bloodshed is inevitable.<eos> And if Hope should ever find out?<eos> She worships you, Niklaus.<eos> She must not see the monster.<eos> I do not wish for her to see me as a monster, but I cannot sit idly by while threats to our family to go unanswered.<eos> They won't.
That is the most indulgent thing I've ever heard.<eos> I'm sure from your bourgeois perspective it would seem indulgent.<eos> What? My bourgeois per...<eos> But I'm going to Zurich Polytechnic.<eos> Y-You failed your entrance exam.<eos> I won't fail again.<eos> - Who do you think's gonna pay for this Zurich Polytechnic, huh?<eos> The same people who pay for you to keep plundering your businesses into the ground.<eos> Mother's family. - That's who. - Oh.<eos> Like hell they will.
She used to live over on Troy? This is her girl.<eos> Oh. Right.<eos> Hey, Taystee.<eos> Daddy, let's go!<eos> All right, baby.<eos> I'll see you at home.<eos> Bye, Mommy!<eos> Bye, other lady!<eos> They don't know about me.<eos> They will.
They respect it.<eos> They're dogs.<eos> If you beat them, they obey you.<eos> Not women.<eos> Women don't fear pain the way men do.<eos> They have to be broken in other ways.<eos> But make no mistake... they have to be broken.<eos> Many inmates have tried to make a fool of me over the years.<eos> None have succeeded.<eos> And none ever will.
Old Brucey's just getting warmed up.<eos> When he starts talking about himself in third person, we're golden.<eos> And here comes the pain.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Okay.<eos> - The best smack talk?<eos> No talk at all.<eos> I wish restaurants still had smoking sections, you know?<eos> You should run for office on that platform, Ma.<eos> Yeah, maybe I will.
He looks...<eos> Is he here because of my husband?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> There was a man in the mist.<eos> He came out of nowhere.<eos> He shot Benedict, and then he shot himself.<eos> You can't see a thing outside, man.<eos> Right up against the front door.<eos> When is the police coming?<eos> They will.
They were gunning for her.<eos> I didn't wanna give them more ammunition.<eos> - What if they call me?<eos> - Belle...<eos> - Am I supposed to lie on the stand?<eos> - No.<eos> I could go to jail.<eos> - They're not gonna call you.<eos> - What if they do?<eos> - They won't.
Exotic and hot.<eos> Wonderfully funny and unexpected.<eos> You're forced to keep turning the pages to know what happens next.<eos> We'll take it. 5 shillings.<eos> 5 shillings?<eos> 5 shillings?<eos> That is handbound in kid leather.<eos> You won't find another in London.<eos> - If you could give me credit...<eos> - I will not.
Dee is the most brilliant mind in all Europe.<eos> His private library is larger than that of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge combined.<eos> He astrologized the defeat of the Spanish Armada.<eos> Some say he actually conjured the storm.<eos> Talk to us, Michael.<eos> Unlock the 49 gates of wisdom...<eos> I wanted to see what a believer like yourself made of Dee's angels and demons.<eos> and make your plan for us known!<eos> Are there others amongst you who dare to look into the flame?<eos> I will.
So what I thought would take a couple days is looking like it's gonna take a week.<eos> And I shouldn't be doing this on my vacation.<eos> That's for you and the kids.<eos> Matt.<eos> This is important.<eos> Your mom wanted you to find her.<eos> And maybe next year, we'll all go together once you do.<eos> - If I do.<eos> If I do.<eos> - You will.
The man's barely human.<eos> Give us this day our daily bread... and lead us not into temptation.<eos> Day our daily bread.<eos> Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.<eos> It will require an oven built of bricks and clay<eos> - to obtain sufficient heat.<eos> - We'll all put our hand to it.<eos> I didn't say I'd take on the task.<eos> Well, of course you will, James Read.<eos> Of course he will, Henry.
What I beheld inside was a chamber of wonders.<eos> These plans are... magnificent.<eos> Do I see signs of the Hermetic code?<eos> An apostle of the square, level and plumb, are we?<eos> I am a Freemason, yes.<eos> This city.<eos> This does not exist, does it?<eos> Not yet.<eos> No.<eos> But it will.
I love you.<eos> Cousins!<eos> ♪ You are my sunshine ♪<eos> ♪ My only sunshine ♪<eos> ♪ You make me happy ♪ ♪ When skies are gray. ♪<eos> ♪ You'll never know, dear ♪ ♪ How much I love you ♪<eos> ♪ So please don't take ♪ ♪ My sunshine away. ♪<eos> All right, old man.<eos> I let you sleep 'cause we had a late night, but those ducks ain't gonna wait all day.<eos> Well, actually they probably will, but I won't.
And she had this laugh, it was...<eos> It was contagious.<eos> And when Lisa got going, you knew eventually you were gonna end up on the floor right next to her.<eos> I miss that.<eos> I miss her.<eos> I just wanna honor her, you know, and her memory.<eos> I think you just did.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think the only way to really honor her is to catch this killer who took her life.<eos> And we will.
No floating.<eos> Your heart rate will rise, and you'll use too much air.<eos> Doesn't matter if the lights aren't on.<eos> Computer, engage navigation system, preset coordinates.<eos> Get me to the damn door, and I'll do the rest.<eos> Preset coordinates engaged.<eos> We should be getting our first look at the ring right about... now.<eos> The ring is dark.<eos> She didn't get it done.<eos> She will.
Everything okay?<eos> - Yeah, uh... uh, I...<eos> I was hoping... I know I should've said something in advance.<eos> - No, no, hey.<eos> What? What is it?<eos> - I want to continue my climb.<eos> Here.<eos> - What'd your mom say about it?<eos> - She gets it.<eos> Or... or she will.
I'm sorry if I offended you.<eos> I-I wasn't trying.<eos> - Oh, it's fine.<eos> We're good, I've just got to be... somewhere else.<eos> - No.<eos> Actually, I'm not sorry.<eos> I care and I'm not going to apologize for that.<eos> - The boy's woke.<eos> Come find me later.<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah, I'll...
We're on the news!<eos> An explosion at a warehouse in Simi Valley today injured four people.<eos> Several passersby were also treated for smoke inhalation. Authorities have...<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I just look terrible.<eos> You have the same look Toby has every time he runs into someone he owes money to.<eos> Someone you're avoiding knows you're back in L.A.?<eos> They didn't.<eos> But they will now.
Only if we live.<eos> Come on.<eos> Move in.<eos> Let's go, go!<eos> They're using the fog as cover.<eos> Go to thermal, go to thermal.<eos> Targets acquired.<eos> Behind the umbrella.<eos> That didn't buy us much time.<eos> No, but this will.
- What?<eos> I could use your help.<eos> Little busy.<eos> - Has he had a rhythm since he arrested?<eos> - Doesn't matter!<eos> It's irreversible brain damage after six minutes.<eos> It matters to this guy.<eos> If I come up there, I lose my guy!<eos> If you stay there, we lose two people!<eos> No, we won't, all right?
Amaya, any sign of Tolkien?<eos> I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's so much suffering.<eos> So many injured.<eos> Miss, please, help me.<eos> Just try to stay still.<eos> Let me see what we're dealing with.<eos> I don't want to die alone.<eos> You won't.
If giannusa gets us to the WITSEC list, why don't we go after him ourselves?<eos> Because you don't know if he has it or where to procure it.<eos> If you arrest him, you'll never find out.<eos> Only agent keen can ascertain that.<eos> Keen's gone dark.<eos> No contact.<eos> You have protocols in place for when she does make contact.<eos> And an understanding that she'd reach out day one.<eos> She didn't.<eos> She will.
- Yeah.<eos> Oh, you're so tight.<eos> What is it?<eos> Oh, j-just stuff from work I can't really talk about.<eos> Can't you just be-- I don't know-- vague?<eos> I...<eos> I guess I was a little aggressive about this thing with my boss.<eos> I may have said a little too much.<eos> It'll work out.<eos> Yeah, it will.
No, not without him knowing. The best we could do is see what horse he's betting on.<eos> Well, that won't do us any good.<eos> Especially if the horse is juiced and wins.<eos> Hold on a sec.<eos> Horse can't win if it doesn't even start, right?<eos> What are you thinking, Christopher?<eos> Well, there's no time to explain, all right, trust me.<eos> Get the name of the horse Garcia's betting on, and then get back to me ASAP.<eos> Hey, just for the record, I have no idea what's going on.<eos> Oh, you will.
Oh, wow.<eos> Heard a lot about you.<eos> We're glad you could make it.<eos> Treat her well.<eos> Or else you'll have to answer to me, and that's not something you want on your calendar.<eos> Oh, well, I think I can handle you, Uncle Albert.<eos> Good choice.<eos> I like him.<eos> Well, I'll see you on the dance floor.<eos> Oh. Yes, you will.
Stop!<eos> - Lisa, please!<eos> - I'm going to McDonald's!<eos> Just come here!<eos> Come on, this is stupid!<eos> Let's go!<eos> - I see you!<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Stay there.<eos> - No, I won't.
- Oh, well, I mean, I'm just seeing this watch for the first time, but it looks like it's got a self-winder.<eos> - You just move your...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> ... arm around to keep it going.<eos> I should probably get going.<eos> - Mother's waiting in the truck... - Mm-hmm. ... and she's patient until she isn't.<eos> Oh, and I've got to get to work, too, before all the single gals show up.<eos> It's pretty hard to concentrate with all the bathroom crying and the half-eaten chocolates getting hurled at the wall.<eos> - Have a good one.<eos> - I will.
Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home. Your house is on fire and your children are home.<eos> - Anne!<eos> - I'm going!<eos> All except one and that's little Anne, for she crept under the frying pan.<eos> - And I'm at my wits' end.<eos> - Well... since you've asked for my advice, Marilla, I would humour her a little while longer.<eos> You really think it's better she continue to stay at home?<eos> Yes.<eos> That is, I wouldn't say "school" again until she's said it herself.<eos> And she will.
All right, let's not dismiss anything.<eos> She might know something. I'll give her a call.<eos> I'll take this stuff to Abby, see if maybe she can pull a fingerprint or touch DNA from someone that is not Gibbs.<eos> You know there are over 4,200 traffic surveillance cameras in D.C.?<eos> More than any other city in the U.S.<eos> Homeland is streaming me video feed from the traffic camera closest to the diner.<eos> Bishop... why are you looking at Kai Chen's file?<eos> I was deleting it.<eos> Please, for your own sanity, leave tracking Chen to the others.<eos> I will.
Hello?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> What are you workin' on, Nick?<eos> Just going over that Norfolk case.<eos> We did pretty good work in there.<eos> That's a pretty long report.<eos> Maybe you want to take a load off.<eos> I will.
Rachel liked to smoke.<eos> She said she was gonna stop, but she would have a rule that she'd only smoke when we listened to this one band we both loved.<eos> Because of the ceremony.<eos> "It should be a ceremony," it's what she said.<eos> Well, even if it's gum, I still prefer to step outside to chew it.<eos> Like lighting a delicious cigarette.<eos> The things we miss, the rituals...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - She doesn't like me.<eos> - She will.
Look, Cathy, your testimony's gonna seem petty and vengeful.<eos> And then where is that gonna leave you?<eos> What prospects?<eos> It's too late.<eos> - You need to take a fall.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Look, the committee is just gonna have to wait.<eos> In two weeks, it's gonna be over anyway, and you're gonna be on the wrong side of this thing.<eos> - Well, we'll see.<eos> - Yes, we will.
We wanted to give it back as soon as possible. We?<eos> Me.<eos> She's hurting, too, but... she is so much stronger.<eos> She's ready to try again. And, and me...<eos> I feel like I can't breathe.<eos> I've never felt this bad in my life, Gibbs.<eos> Just wait until it's 3:00 in the morning and your kid's running 104.<eos> You're just getting started.<eos> That's the point, I'm not starting. You know?<eos> maybe I never will.
I got it.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No. No.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm gonna go with or without you.<eos> I'm going.<eos> I'm not... Well, without me.<eos> All right.<eos> Stay there.<eos> Yeah, I will.
It makes me so mad. I just... I wanna hit something!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Wait!<eos> I know who might have the money.<eos> But we don't have much time.<eos> Who is really good at windsurfing?<eos> Me.<eos> Good thing these guys are having their reunion, too. Yeah.<eos> - I hope this works.<eos> - It will.
There.<eos> All done.<eos> Accept people's feelings without questioning them.<eos> If you understand, then get ready.<eos> What?<eos> Aren't you going, Minami?<eos> The main guest arrives last.<eos> Get going and get ready for when I arrive.<eos> All right.<eos> I will.
- I'll think about it.<eos> I'm gonna think about it.<eos> You were the best fighter in the world.<eos> And I want to see that back in the ring.<eos> You're just happy it will be another black guy getting punched tonight.<eos> No shit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> And tell your wife... I'm sorry.<eos> I will.
We're about to boat race a bunch of those fucks from the University of Georgia up in the room. So... Oh, my God!<eos> University of Georgia! - No way!<eos> You're a Hornet?<eos> - Afraid so.<eos> Well, you guys should get in there then, Edward Jizzumhands.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> We will.<eos> Good, that's great. I'll see you up there.<eos> Good. Well, you say we'll be there and on time. - Sweet.<eos> I will. - Yeah.
Sometimes?<eos> Yeah, all right. All right.<eos> These Japs are sneaky.<eos> I'll take first watch, all right? You get some shut-eye.<eos> Hell of a dream.<eos> Dreamed I got myself skewered.<eos> I couldn't do nothing.<eos> Rifle's just there.<eos> It won't bite.<eos> Yeah, it will.
Cover yourself... Roll with yourself in breadcrumbs and bring a fucking bird up here.<eos> Jim, can you punch Diane up on the preview for me, please?<eos> Sure. There she is.<eos> Patty?<eos> Patty?<eos> - Hi, Diane, can you hear me?<eos> - Yes. Yes, I can.<eos> Lee has read the talking points, right?<eos> Because I'm in a tough position here, and I just want to make sure that he sticks to the script.<eos> He will.
Most would not want anything to do with you because you're Cuban.<eos> And you want exclusive access to our molasses?<eos> No.<eos> You just can not sell it to White.<eos> He's a paying customer.<eos> We never had any problems with him.<eos> I know Albert White.<eos> I thought you would rather deal with someone who treats you as human beings.<eos> This may cause bloodshed.<eos> It sure will.
Why should I bother?<eos> You always win.<eos> You always let me win.<eos> I suppose you are my weakness.<eos> Very well.<eos> Queen to rook five.<eos> Checkmate in three.<eos> Learn from loss, Freya, and your day will come.<eos> Your possibilities will be endless once the magic awakens in your heart.<eos> It won't.
All I had to do was send her to you, and you led her straight to the Mirror.<eos> It's pathetic.<eos> Oh, what are these?<eos> Dwarves.<eos> They're just like children.<eos> We're mighty far from children, Bitch Queen.<eos> Adorable.<eos> Bring me the Mirror.<eos> You'll have to kill me first!<eos> No, I won't.
Packed a hell of a lot in these past five years.<eos> Stop. You're making me jealous.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Grass is always greener.<eos> Well... I'd better get going.<eos> - What'll you be doing tonight?<eos> - Singing... At a little club off MacDougal... Called "Molly's."<eos> You should come along sometime.<eos> I'm there almost every night.<eos> Maybe one day I will.
Stop it, Rodney!<eos> He is my friend.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Rodney, come on!<eos> Greet them one more time, then I miss you a red sock!<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - My meal!<eos> - Oh, you want your food?<eos> - Yes I want to!<eos> - Will the Ape Man his banana?
Hi.<eos> Clark had this sent here so he can surprise you.<eos> All the circuses back east, burying an empty box.<eos> They don't know how to honor him.<eos> Except as a soldier.<eos> I've failed him, in life.<eos> I won't fail him in death.<eos> Help me find the others like you.<eos> Perhaps they don't want to be found.<eos> They will.
Of course, the rhinos sleep standing up.<eos> I don't think I'd be very good at that.<eos> It's either the turtles or the crocodiles.<eos> Which one do you think is better?<eos> Bagheerai neither.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I'm bringing you to the man village.<eos> What?<eos> Bagheera, I don't know man.<eos> You will.
This ain't like you.<eos> You remember what you said to me once?<eos> "It's not how hard you can hit, "it's how hard you can get hit and still keep moving forward."<eos> It's from Rocky, mate. It's from Rocky.<eos> Yeah... but when you said it, it made me think about life.<eos> Whereas he was just talking about boxing.<eos> No, he meant it metaphorically in the movie, so...<eos> - Yeah. Still, though, innit?<eos> - Don't tell anyone about this phone call.<eos> All right then, I won't.
- No! - It's his birthday!<eos> - Come on!<eos> No, Mom!<eos> Just a little something.<eos> The suitcase is already overstuffed with gifts for Will.<eos> It's always fun to get something from the airport.<eos> Feels like you've travelled, too.<eos> Ma, he's turning one.<eos> Don't think he'll be discerning what gift came from where.<eos> But I will.
And how does a boy get close enough to the Emperor... to avenge his father?<eos> A princess sacrifice.<eos> Do you really think I would let you get close to the Emperor?<eos> She said you would come for her, but what I don't understand... why wasn't it you who brought her here.<eos> She showed me something greater.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, my friend... the Emperor took her soul last night.<eos> Run, Warrior, while you have the chance.<eos> Go in peace.<eos> Running won't give me peace.<eos> Then what will?
I know.<eos> Your mind is the most powerful I've ever seen.<eos> It can convince itself...<eos> No, no...<eos> It's not just the mind-reading or the telekinesis... it's something else.<eos> Some dark power inside and it's growing.<eos> Like a fire.<eos> I thought I was getting better.<eos> You are.<eos> You will.
Am I right?<eos> Frankly, I feel like I've given the military enough.<eos> And from the looks of it, so have you.<eos> And I have sympathy for men who have fought in wars and even those who have abandoned 'em.<eos> So, you find yourself another town far away from here.<eos> One with fancy whores and fine whiskey and a chink with a pot of opium that's just begging for a man like you to come into his life.<eos> You do what you need to do.<eos> I expect you earned it.<eos> But don't you ever, if I ever hear a whispering of you or that dog being even near these parts again, you'll be begging for the army to come get ya.<eos> But they won't.

Well, keep at it.<eos> Runt!<eos> Sophie.<eos> Hide.<eos> Oh, Runty, is you at home?<eos> Quick, quick, quick!<eos> I has a boo-boo.<eos> Well, you's a big boy.<eos> You take care of your boo-boos yourself now.<eos> Oh, I will.

It's Jyn.<eos> Jyn?<eos> Stardust.<eos> Papa.<eos> I've seen your message.<eos> The hologram, I've seen it.<eos> It must be destroyed.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> We will.
I told you maybe he was lucky not to see all this.<eos> That's the lie I tell myself.<eos> I want his clothes. I want his smell. I want his room.<eos> I want him, not this fucking picture.<eos> Denise, I spoke with my daughter.<eos> She's alive.<eos> Oh, my God, Lauren.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> How long do you think it will take for them to send another team?<eos> Maybe a day or a week, but they will.
She has her head in the clouds.<eos> She's not mad.<eos> Don't believe the gossips.<eos> She needs a man in her life.<eos> A husband.<eos> I hardly know you.<eos> But you seem the solid type.<eos> But she...<eos> Has she seen me?<eos> She will.
Yeah, he looks like one.<eos> Look, just leave this to me, ok?<eos> They know me, but if Darth Vader shows up, they might get a bit suspicious.<eos> I'm not happy with you doing this alone.<eos> Look, we need to find that footage.<eos> One of them must have the camera.<eos> Ok, if you turn anything up or you're in any trouble, you call me straight away.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Please, be careful.<eos> Yeah, I will.
We'd be lying to everyone.<eos> But you have to remember what's at stake.<eos> We're talking about tens of thousands of lives, and the future of Scotland itself.<eos> Surely that's worth the price?<eos> Even if that price is our souls?<eos> That won't happen.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> We have to trust in this.<eos> In this I do.<eos> And in this I will.
Where's Joe's belongings?<eos> The plastic bag right here.<eos> Give me a sec.<eos> Where's Joe's belongings?<eos> All right, all right, that's good, hold.<eos> Like that?<eos> Yeah, but keep your thumb off the line. If you get a strike, it's going to slice it right open. You know what happens then.<eos> What'?<eos> Sharks will smell the blood and they'll rip this boat apart.<eos> No, they won't.

Just holidays.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yes, please?<eos> Yes, I'm already here.<eos> Sure, okay.<eos> Okay, talk soon.<eos> She asked if you'd like to join her to an American Embassy reception this evening.<eos> - Was that her?<eos> - Yes, she's still in the meeting.<eos> When she will.
You don't seriously imagine I'd take pleasure in an outrage like this?<eos> Mr Lancaster understood my point of view.<eos> Which is more than I did.<eos> Regardless of past disagreements, please accept my sincere condolences.<eos> And if there's anything I can do...<eos> I think you've done enough, Reverend Ackers.<eos> My officers and the forensics team will be finished here soon.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr Lancaster, I assume you will remain in Little Malton for the time being?<eos> Well, of course he will.
- Hello?<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm not here.<eos> I'm in eastbourne with my area manager.<eos> "A thing of beauty is a joy forever.<eos> "Its loveliness increases..."<eos> Arthur, this is not the time.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'll come back.<eos> No, I won't!

- Possibly?<eos> It's a conversation.<eos> Tell me, can your little birds get a message to the Good Masters of Astapor, the Wise Masters of Yunkai, and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?<eos> Of course. Men can be fickle, but birds I always trust.<eos> Your eye looks much better, Arthur.<eos> How's your mother's jaw?<eos> Better.<eos> And your father?<eos> No one's seen him.<eos> And no one will.
- What?<eos> You sick and tired of what?<eos> About sick and tired of the Knicks losing' all the time, man!<eos> You got some hair, too, right there.<eos> - I'm not finished.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> - Hey, Counselor.<eos> - Aw, don't jinx me, Pop.<eos> I haven't even passed the bar yet.<eos> Oh, you will.
"You do windows, brother."<eos> That wasn't no question.<eos> We need this place open.<eos> I know.<eos> You gonna run it?<eos> I ain't no barber.<eos> What about you?<eos> Another question for another time, my man.<eos> We gotta figure out something soon either way.<eos> I will.
I like Chester Himes.<eos> This is a good one.<eos> It's actually mine.<eos> What were you reading before?<eos> Some West Coast shit.<eos> Michael Connelly.<eos> - You ever read Harry Bosch?<eos> - Nah.<eos> Well, you'll have some time to read now.<eos> No, I won't.
Perhaps a little too close to home.<eos> Jesus, is he saying that the rebel forces are being funded by the U.S.?<eos> This is Frank Bonneville, Q365 News.<eos> That's huge.<eos> Good one.<eos> Couldn't have done better myself.<eos> - We can keep this going for ages.<eos> - Yeah, let's see if they buy it first.<eos> They will.<eos> They will.
Let's go find your brother.<eos> I owe him an apology.<eos> All right, Malina, take off your hood.<eos> - Someone might recognize me.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> You're gonna get her killed.<eos> Says the guy who tried to kill her yesterday.<eos> Look, I told you, we need to get Tommy's attention, and the best way to do that is with that news crew right there.<eos> What if Erica Kravid sees it too?<eos> She probably will.
No, no, no.<eos> I ain't got much.<eos> My faith, Momma, Nana.<eos> Up until now, enough.<eos> Cherry, I'd feel right honored if you'd be my wife.<eos> I'd treat ya right.<eos> Protect ya with my life.<eos> If you'd have me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
Kill Chang, start a war with the Sze Yup.<eos> I want life with you.<eos> You ain't safe here.<eos> I love you.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> Hey!<eos> Listen. You need to run from this place, fast and as far as you can<eos> before death catches up with you.<eos> You hear me?<eos> It Will.
Do you, Thomas Michael Shelby, take Grace Helen Burgess to be your lawful wedded wife?<eos> TOMMY: Ida.<eos> Do you, Grace Helen Burgess, solemnly swear to love, honour, and obey till death do you part?<eos> GRACE: Ida.<eos> JEREMIAH: I now pronounce you husband and wife.<eos> Get out of it!<eos> - Go on, take the photograph! -(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)<eos> Tommy.<eos> Arthur, get the bastards in the house.<eos> I will. I will. john!
Then what exactly is our plan?<eos> Your big plan isn't exactly my problem.<eos> Shocking turn of events.<eos> Oh, Wil, come on.<eos> Don't forget to hide your ears.<eos> Wait, you're leaving us?<eos> What is this, a party?<eos> Yeah, and I want you to do the honors.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Oh, you will in a second.
Well, fortunately, so are we.<eos> You have to choose who you're more afraid of.<eos> The Peaky Blinders at exactly 11:43, or Section D at some point in the future.<eos> If you make the wrong choice, you won't see 11:44.<eos> LINDA: Do they always have to do the stock taking at night, Arthur?<eos> ARTHUR: Only 'cause, you know, it slows down production.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Night work will have to end.<eos> It will.

If you hurry, you can make it out before he gets back.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> This must be very stressful for you and your baby.<eos> We're fine.<eos> Could I have some water?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You heard him.<eos> He's not a bad man at heart.<eos> You have to tell them that.<eos> I will.
Is there a difference?<eos> Yes.<eos> And if you can't make your peace with that, then you're not ready.<eos> There will be others, Master Bruce.<eos> Karen was the only one who knew what The Philosopher looked like.<eos> How are we going to find him now?<eos> You need to have faith, Bruce.<eos> I know what you risked today.<eos> If Barnes finds out you were involved...<eos> He will.
I can't stay at home and do nothing.<eos> We need to trust Jim Gordon.<eos> I'm tired of trusting Jim Gordon, aren't you?<eos> I am your guardian, Master Bruce, and it is my job to protect you.<eos> Is it your job to watch me sit on my hands and do nothing?<eos> Alfred, please.<eos> Let me go.<eos> Hey, buddy, move your car!<eos> Just... just be careful, all right?<eos> I will.
Strange!<eos> Strange!<eos> Strange!<eos> Strange, you son of a bitch!<eos> Come back here!<eos> So... you're really doing this?<eos> Not my call.<eos> Prepare the patients for transport to the upstate facility.<eos> If even one of your patients were to escape...<eos> They won't.
I don't like coming here, threatening to knock on your door, but if you don't return calls or answer messages, what do you expect?<eos> People will read things into things, people aren't stupid.<eos> Look, work's mad.<eos> We're understaffed.<eos> I'm doing 15 people's jobs, I don't even know what week it is, but you can't be here.<eos> I've not seen you for three weeks, not properly.<eos> And then nothing.<eos> Jack shit for five days.<eos> You're overreacting, you're reading too much into stuff.<eos> - Well, people will.
- Don't stay out late.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Listen.<eos> Will you promise me something?<eos> In fact, let's make a promise to each other.<eos> I don't know if this child will ruin our lives.<eos> He probably will.
None of this makes any sense.<eos> Maybe it's for the best.<eos> What?<eos> Well, the sad fact is that she's been dead to you for 25 years.<eos> You've already grieved.<eos> Like with Kelly.<eos> When she died, I was devastated.<eos> But... now that she's gone,<eos> I mean, I-I love Kelly.<eos> I always will.
I love you.<eos> I gotta call it a night, okay?<eos> It's about Leah?<eos> Bro, how long are you chasing that? Fucking...<eos> Fuck off, B.<eos> - Okay? I'm not leaving 'cause of Leah.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> Dude, this party is fucking weird as hell anyway.<eos> All right. Tell Mom and Dad I said hi.<eos> - Okay, I will.
Okay, don't worry... I won't get any more tattoos of them while they're here.<eos> Thank you. Okay.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, one more thing, stop calling them motherfuckers and talking about how hot my mom is.<eos> Well, she's sneaky sexy, took me by surprise.<eos> Dude, she is a MILF, like a genuine MILF.<eos> And if it wasn't your MILF, she'd be a MIWF... a mother I would fuck.<eos> Mmm-mmm. But I won't.
Man, get out of here, please?<eos> Sure.<eos> Just go.<eos> If we get rid of Camilla... who gets Empire?<eos> I don't know, man, but... look, the board got rid of Lucious and it got nasty, so it's not like they're going to reinstate him.<eos> Yeah, but nobody thinks I should have it.<eos> Who cares?<eos> I'm looking at your right now, and you're a natural. You know, but it's not going to be easy.<eos> You know, with everything that you did. You got to really prove yourself to the rest of the family.<eos> I will.
-Gale!<eos> Gale! No!<eos> Self destruct in two minutes.<eos> -Jim.<eos> -Lewis.<eos> Lewis, what happened?<eos> Who did this? I don't know.<eos> We kept filming like you said.<eos> -I did?<eos> -You will.
You changed the locks on the door again.<eos> Sorry, I should have told you.<eos> - Does Grandma know you're here?<eos> - I left her a note.<eos> I really don't think they'll miss me.<eos> - Deva.<eos> - I'm not going back, Mom.<eos> There's no Wi-Fi and it smells like ass there.<eos> - Honey, if the court finds out...<eos> - They won't.
I gotta change. - I'm going to see Champagne Enema tonight.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's the new band name.<eos> But Simon and Maureen are taking me out after.<eos> But it's... It's your 18th birthday, and... everything's gonna change for you now.<eos> Mom, we've had the talk.<eos> I'm good.<eos> We need to have a much different and more important talk.<eos> And we will.
The valiant taste of death but once."<eos> Of course, Shakespeare never met a man quite like you, Teddy.<eos> You've died at least a thousand times.<eos> And yet, it doesn't dull your courage.<eos> Tell me, is that all you aspire to, Teddy?<eos> There's a girl...<eos> Dolores.<eos> Better than I deserve.<eos> But maybe someday soon we'll have the life we've both been dreaming of.<eos> No, you never will.
Don't you think you should at least meet this Barker fellow?<eos> So where are we?<eos> Seventeen hundred people slated for exiting.<eos> Their negated options total 780,000 shares. That money can be allocated anyway you see fit.<eos> Employee bonuses, renovations to the day-care center. What have you.<eos> What should we prioritize?<eos> Sorry, I don't understand.<eos> It's all in the document. You take that severance package, and you leave Hooli immediately.<eos> But the most important aspect is the non-disclosure, non-disparagement clause, in which you agree not to say anything negative in the press, in public, or in private about Hooli or Gavin Belson.<eos> Okay, I won't.
He got here for morning service, he saw the door had been forced.<eos> Checked the building, went to the bell tower and saw the open shutter and looked down.<eos> Do we know what time this happened?<eos> Sprinklers are on a timer, grass under the body is wet but her clothes are dry.<eos> Puts it between 3 a.m. and first light.<eos> Are you sure about the identification?<eos> Hospital ID card, and I saw her face.<eos> It's Charlotte DiLaurentis.<eos> Stay with her until she falls asleep.<eos> I will.
They'll think I made you do it.<eos> I'm not going back to jail.<eos> I'm better off up here.<eos> This is no place for a kid.<eos> You're going to have to go back, Ricky.<eos> To what?<eos> - Well, to the welfare people.<eos> - No.<eos> - They'll look after you.<eos> - No, they won't.
Damn, my three favorite things in the whole world:<eos> Sushi, dancing salsa and Ciudad Lineal.<eos> Jorge, this may upset you, but I hope you take it well.<eos> Or at least that you understand.<eos> You haven't said anything yet.<eos> Don't rush me, I'm trying.<eos> And I'm nervous, what do you expect?<eos> You won't understand and you'll take it all the wrong way.<eos> I'll understand, no matter...<eos> No, you won't.
Why are you hiding back here?<eos> You were right, Will.<eos> We sold out.<eos> I miss Charlie so much, I can barely breathe, but there's-- there's got to be another way, something that doesn't have us working for Snyder.<eos> Where's all this coming from?<eos> What happened?<eos> I thought we agreed.<eos> We rationalized, but we can't trust him.<eos> We sold our souls, and we may never get anything in return.<eos> Yes, we will.
Don't talk of her like that. I thought you had more sense.<eos> Better taste.<eos> The Kims of this world are ten-a-penny.<eos> Enough! I want what's best for you.<eos> She is not it.<eos> All I've ever wanted is for my boys to be something in life and in racing.<eos> So just...<eos> Just think again, yeah?<eos> For me.<eos> No, I won't.
As I'll ever be.<eos> I erm want to say I'm sorry.<eos> It's Kim you should say sorry to.<eos> I don't mean about yesterday.<eos> I mean about everything.<eos> You were right, it erm...<eos> has always been about me.<eos> I have... tried to live my life through my kids, which I shouldn't have.<eos> I just wanted you to have the shot at success I never got.<eos> And I will.
Morgan... they always come back.<eos> Come back when they're dead, too.<eos> Yeah, we'll stop them.<eos> We have before.<eos> I'm not talking about the walkers. Morgan wants to talk to them first.<eos> I think that would be a mistake, but it's not up to me.<eos> I'll talk to the people still at home.<eos> I'll discuss it with the people on guard now, too, but who else wants to approach the Saviors, talk to them first?<eos> What happened here, we won't let that happen again.<eos> I won't.
What, for her?<eos> She's gone, man.<eos> You're doing this for you.<eos> Man, I don't give a shit.<eos> Daryl... we need to get back there and figure this out from home.<eos> Our home.<eos> We need you, and everyone back there needs us right now.<eos> It's... it's gonna go wrong out here.<eos> We'll square it.<eos> I will.
Bobby and I made it a point to do the opposite.<eos> How much we've given to the fire department, the police, all the first responders?<eos> I can't show my face in the neighborhood.<eos> The guys at my old house, they're talking about driving fire trucks through Bobby's office.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Who's talking that shit?<eos> Mikey?<eos> Look, Lar, we just want to make a plan.<eos> This is Bobby's mess. He has to clean it up.<eos> We will.
I'll have your things sent to you.<eos> And frankly, you should be more careful when making your vacation plans next time.<eos> We are so sorry, sir.<eos> - It's all yours, Inspector.<eos> So, you do not work for S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> - I do not.<eos> - Doesn't exist anymore.<eos> And you're telling me they don't work - for any U.S. government agency.<eos> - No. They do not.<eos> And they never will.
Oh, yeah?<eos> Well, that's good for him.<eos> Katherine, go find your way over there.<eos> That Colonel Jim is a tall glass of water.<eos> That he is.<eos> Tall, strong, commanding.<eos> And I bet he's like that day and night.<eos> Mary, it's Sunday.<eos> Please have some shame.<eos> I will not.
You've apparently gone into something called a fugue state.<eos> Look at me, Vanessa.<eos> I'm not going to lie to you.<eos> There's a lot we don't understand.<eos> It's a mental and physical break, a disassociation with your bodily functions, something like a coma.<eos> When will it end?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do people die like this?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you won't.
And I dragged him to Cape Town in chains.<eos> And then I reported to the infirmary.<eos> I'll admit...<eos> I'm envious of their fire.<eos> A bit cavalier, though, don't you think?<eos> Out there in the open, taunting their prey.<eos> There's no need to hide when you've got the numbers.<eos> Ah, but do they?<eos> He's dying of thirst.<eos> We will, too.
I'm ok. Taiana?<eos> All right, where's the fire?<eos> What's this?<eos> The safest place within 100 miles to survive a nuclear attack.<eos> Based on wind patterns--<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. What are you talking about?<eos> The world is going to end in two hours.<eos> I need you to take my mother there.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Yeah, I will.
They still have got you locked up.<eos> Was somebody being a bad boy?<eos> You like the bad boys.<eos> We have a history.<eos> I thought we had a future once, but I gave him his chance and he refused, so now I just feel sorry for him.<eos> Damn it, Fitz.<eos> Your friends are very persistent.<eos> They keep fighting us, forcing us to move, wasting valuable time.<eos> If it happens again, there'll be no absolution.<eos> It won't.
In Greenland, we Catholics are like the native Americans.<eos> We got there first and then we were confined to reservations.<eos> I agree, Holy Father.<eos> You are a woman who tends to agree.<eos> Oh, don't worry, Madame Prime Minister.<eos> I'm not asking you for anything for our small community in Greenland.<eos> I just wanted to remind you that we Catholics were there first.<eos> Everyone else is a guest.<eos> I don't want you to forget that.<eos> - I won't, Holy Father.
- Me too.<eos> I was abandoned by my parents when I was just three years old.<eos> Children are so lovely when they are three years of age.<eos> How can anyone abandon a three year old?<eos> Where do you find the nerve?<eos> I never knew you were an orphan, too.<eos> Well... now you know.<eos> - Does Lenny know?<eos> - No.<eos> And he never will.
- They're in the vents. - Lock down the armory.<eos> Simmons, secure what you can in the lab and then rendezvous in my office.<eos> Lincoln and I will protect the nerve center.<eos> So I'll just stay here?<eos> - Daisy took the module into the plane.<eos> - To stop Hive.<eos> You think that she can do it?<eos> Get us some rope in case she can't.<eos> You know killing me won't make the pain go away.<eos> Or will it?
Lure him out of hiding.<eos> And I know exactly where we do it.<eos> A Downworld rave.<eos> - Nice, Izzy.<eos> - And where'd you get that?<eos> During my surveillance of the Downworlders.<eos> From what I hear, Magnus likes to party.<eos> He'll never go for it.<eos> Not with Valentine trying to kill him.<eos> Of course he will.
Is he gonna be all right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Does he normally just lay like that without moving?<eos> Get up. Jace. Jace.<eos> I'm all right. I'm all right.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> I'm just getting my second wind.<eos> There's nothing to be ashamed of, Alec.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You will.
Our new names.<eos> Joe Boardman is a good name.<eos> And besides, I've never kissed an Edith before, but I certainly think I can get used to that.<eos> And what about all this?<eos> How do we explain to our son why his mother and father keep moving every couple of years, changing their names, looking over their shoulders at every turn?<eos> I don't know why we thought we could do this again.<eos> Do you think we're selfish?<eos> To have a family?<eos> Because when Savage finds us--<eos> He won't.
Go, go, go!<eos> Shoot that son of a bitch!<eos> - We got him! Come on!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Get down here!<eos> - One batch, two batch.<eos> Penny and dime.<eos> They're gonna pay.<eos> Every single goddamn one of 'em.<eos> They will.
Jamie, I'm so sorry.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> The last thing I'd ever want to do is keep you away from your kids.<eos> What's done is done, Ange.<eos> Just got to figure out a way to make it all work.<eos> Are you comfortable with the kids coming back here?<eos> Yeah, of course I am.<eos> You made a mistake, Ange.<eos> I mean, it won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
I am a Mandinka warrior.<eos> Mandinka?<eos> I will kill many Americans for your king!<eos> You'll have to walk.<eos> Head east into the Great Dismal Swamp and meet up with Lord Dunmore's Ethiopian regiment.<eos> You'll be given food, shelter, and a letter of manumission.<eos> What is "a letter of manumission"?<eos> It's the piece of paper that states you're free.<eos> And slave masters will believe this paper?<eos> They will in England. Hyah!
It's OK.<eos> I would've, too, if I were in your shoes.<eos> I love you... too much, I guess.<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> I just need to learn how to let you, you know?<eos> Listen.<eos> There's some stuff going on by your place, possible outbreak, and it's got everybody worried.<eos> I think you should stay with me in Edgewood, just until this gets sorted out.<eos> I haven't heard anything about it.<eos> You will.
Doesn't serve the virus to kill its host so quickly.<eos> It's suicide.<eos> A smart virus keeps its host alive.<eos> Hepatitis, polio, HIV.<eos> Beautiful, evolved viruses.<eos> This virus?<eos> It isn't smart or elegant.<eos> It's just brutal and short-sighted,<eos> - and it doesn't deserve to win.<eos> - And it won't.
Don't you ever knock?<eos> You tried to seduce Mr. Powell?<eos> ! What were you thinking?<eos> I was following your advice.<eos> My advice?<eos> You said always blackmail for something good, so I made a deal.<eos> I seduce Mrs. Powell's husband and she introduces me to a music producer.<eos> Wait.<eos> Mrs. Powell knows a music producer?<eos> Yep, and now I will, too.
What are you doing for money?<eos> I got a job.<eos> I'm a waitress.<eos> Okay, that's good.<eos> Good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Work is work.<eos> They're talking about me on Powers That Be.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> They will.
- I don't.<eos> - Sounds like you need it.<eos> No, I'm just, I can help. I'm not...<eos> - I'm just worried about you, that's all.<eos> - Worried about me?<eos> Well, you should probably worry about yourself.<eos> All right.<eos> We have a midsize.<eos> Who will be paying for this?<eos> He will.
Are there roads?<eos> Can we drive?<eos> There is one road, but it's crawling with bandits.<eos> Follow me, please, gentlemen.<eos> This is my sundries closet.<eos> You'll find all the knowledge and supplies that you'll need for your journey.<eos> Pull this off and you're homeward bound.<eos> Look, you said it was a day's hike.<eos> Why would we need all this shit?<eos> Maybe you won't.
I know, but what are we gonna do?<eos> You know, maybe it's about time we started using a little leverage ourselves.<eos> Look, Agent Dylan's been trying to take down<eos> Braxton for years, right?<eos> That's why he's trying to kill her by blowing up your office.<eos> And setting you up to take the fall.<eos> You think you have enough proof to build a case against him?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But DHS isn't gonna believe anything I found.<eos> Yeah, but maybe he will.
She can help us.<eos> She has a right to help us.<eos> And we need to take advantage of it.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> Gil!<eos> Hey, Jessie... hey, you want to do this, all right, he's got a point...<eos> you have to be careful.<eos> I know.<eos> I will.
Dalbir ma'am!<eos> Dalbir ma'am!<eos> Dalbir ma'am!<eos> Dalbir ma'am!<eos> Madam.<eos> The new government of Pakistan has put a stay on death penalty.<eos> Sister... they've put an indefinite stay.<eos> It means Sarbjit's death sentenced has been postponed for now.<eos> This means... papa's coming home?<eos> Not yet... but he definitely will.
But Alaric needs this.<eos> You know, he doesn't have the necessary accoutrements of a single father-to-be.<eos> Well, don't worry.<eos> I'm gonna still get him that baby Bjorn thing or whatever you made me click on when I was drunk.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, be safe today, ok?<eos> I finally got you back to reality.<eos> I want to keep you in one piece.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> I will.
You' re pretty!<eos> You' re pretty! No touching.<eos> I like vans.<eos> In you go, in you go.<eos> I like vans.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Drive!<eos> Max, will you please tell me whatjust happened?<eos> You wouldn't believe me anyway.<eos> I will now.
Shouldn't have had to.<eos> What's that?<eos> Alaric's working his magic so you're not associated with the demonic murders.<eos> You saved our Alpha.<eos> The pack's indebted to you.<eos> So, I'm thinking... moo shu pork for life?<eos> What are we even looking for?<eos> I'll know it when I see it.<eos> What if this doesn't work?<eos> It will, biscuit.
It's a terrible, life-destroying burden.<eos> I zapped myself onto Mount Everest. Lost my leg to frostbite.<eos> I'd be dead if not for one deeply confused Sherpa.<eos> Had the lecture yet on sticking with astral projection?<eos> I don't watch "Star Trek."<eos> Travelers' training wheels.<eos> Your body stays here; your mind travels.<eos> It's like being a ghost.<eos> Meditating won't stop you from having a wet dream and waking up in the Marianas Trench.<eos> This will.
Don't even think about it.<eos> I'm not going to stand for this.<eos> Seth: Then sit down, 'cause this is the game.<eos> You knew that when you signed up to play.<eos> What if I told you the game is about to change?<eos> Seth.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They have no idea what's coming, do they?<eos> They will.
You two were in a relationship, and when you found out that it was her that wrote that email, you went up to Cambridge and convinced her to go to Argentina for the duration of the trial.<eos> You're out of your mind.<eos> Am I?<eos> You flew to Boston three times in the last two weeks.<eos> You took two cabs to her house and another to within 100 feet of the admissions office.<eos> You have no proof of anything.<eos> I don't need proof.<eos> Because while she may be in Argentina now, she's not gonna stay there forever, which means when she gets back,<eos> I get you for witness tampering. Do me a favor and leave me the hell alone.<eos> I will.
It wasn't just the look on your father's face.<eos> It's the look on your mother's.<eos> They think I'm taking away your future.<eos> You are my future.<eos> Hey, hey. I am not saying that I don't want to get married.<eos> I'm just saying that if for some reason I was responsible for taking away your dream...<eos> That you'd never be able to live with yourself.<eos> You go finish law school, okay?<eos> And you pass the bar, and you become a lawyer, and then... in two years when I get out, if you still want to marry me...<eos> Oh, I will.
But it doesn't matter.<eos> 'Cause even knowing how it all turned out...<eos> I'd do it again.<eos> I guess I would too, 'cause I never thought in a million years I'd meet someone dumb enough to be willing to go to prison for me.<eos> I mean, Donna always said you were looking for another you.<eos> I guess you found one.<eos> I guess it's time to get busy living and get busy dying.<eos> Well, that's goddamn right.<eos> Watch your back in there, Mike.<eos> I will.
Thank you for the tip, Raymond.<eos> The families, theirs and ours, we're getting together tomorrow.<eos> It'd be nice to have a friendly face.<eos> I'd rather die than have an Eriksson touch my little girl.<eos> So would I.<eos> But you're giving her away.<eos> For what?<eos> A business deal that will never hold?<eos> A war that will never end?<eos> Oh, it will.
Code red. Code red.<eos> All units, please respond.<eos> We are under heavy fire.<eos> MAN 2:<eos> Bearcat, don't dismount there, shut it down.<eos> Who the hell are these guys?<eos> We can't be late.<eos> We gotta find them.<eos> ARAM:<eos> Yeah, and we will.
What do you think, S?<eos> I think we have two factions of Neos with competing technologies.<eos> Bots versus clones.<eos> And if we are not careful, we are gonna get screwed again.<eos> We're not gonna let that happen.<eos> We need to find out what Krystal knows about Van Lier.<eos> You're with me, yeah?<eos> Keep trying Cosima, S. Let's get to the bottom of this.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - We will.
It's up to you.<eos> It should have always been up to you.<eos> ‭Stay there.<eos> It's good we're here.<eos> ‭How's that?<eos> 10 more minutes, and I might start to regret all the times I tried to shoot and stab you.<eos> I think you're my favorite person I ever knocked out.<eos> Definitely top two or three.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> I will.
I'm only speculating on a hypothesis.<eos> All right, I get it.<eos> But let's just say, hypothetically, that I was looking for a certain revenant, let's call him Father Malick, should I look in the trailer park?<eos> Hypothetically?<eos> I'd say yep.<eos> So who told you Malick's here?<eos> Not at liberty to discuss.<eos> So it's your friend Henry?<eos> One of these days I'm gonna have - to meet this guy, right?<eos> - One of these days you will.
And I mean that as a compliment.<eos> Welcome to Westworld.<eos> Live without limits.<eos> The next departing train will leave track one.<eos> Please be mindful of the closing doors.<eos> - Thank you for visiting. - Westworld.<eos> The train will be departing in 15 minutes.<eos> You think you'll never lose control of this place.<eos> Of us.<eos> But you will.
The North Avenue Boys, but he was getting out.<eos> How was he doing that?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I, uh... let him come by the firehouse, hang around.<eos> I was just trying to show him there's another way to live. That's a good thing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, listen, this is a good start.<eos> We got a lot to go on.<eos> You got to bring him in, Ruzek. You got to get this guy.<eos> We will, all right?
If anyone can ferret out a whore and a little girl, it's that fucking ching-ching.<eos> Wait.<eos> Jingim?<eos> They have not checked in at way station or checkpoint.<eos> What will you tell the Khan?<eos> The counter-raids are a resounding success.<eos> Jingim does us proud once again.<eos> My son.<eos> Kaidu will think twice about further treason.<eos> No, he won't.
I followed my heart.<eos> Traveled the world, made people smile, forget about their problems for a while.<eos> And then my heart said, "Well, you're done".<eos> I had my fill and...<eos> And I retired.<eos> And I love it.<eos> Hey, you know, this place isn't what I expected.<eos> Oh, life here is great.<eos> I'd just like to enjoy it a little more.<eos> And you will.
According to this, it's the only way to get that thing off.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> Hold him.<eos> I got him!<eos> Now what?<eos> I don't know, it's the first time I've ever done this.<eos> Well, how do we know if it works?<eos> Well, supposedly, the mask is just gonna come off, and be released from the possessed and return to its natural form, I think.<eos> What if it takes, like, hours?<eos> It won't.
And we have in this case, a five power conference first.<eos> - So, we start with this.<eos> - Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> - He's here.<eos> - He's here!<eos> Don't rush, darling.<eos> It'll take him an hour to get to the front door.<eos> And then an hour to get through the bloody thing!<eos> Now, don't forget the two things we discussed.<eos> - I won't.
That doesn't make any sense.<eos> No, it's the law.<eos> It's not supposed to.<eos> Bottom line is, is we're still in the game.<eos> That's the good news.<eos> Get back!<eos> Clear back!<eos> Come on!<eos> Woman: Somebody call 911!<eos> Man: I will!
That's the story you'll have to tell if this operation does not go as I've planned.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> I wanted to tell you personally and privately, sir, so I can prepare you for the worst.<eos> The worst being we lose the hostages and start a war with China?<eos> It's important you maintain deniability.<eos> I'm willing to take the heat, sir.<eos> - There are no other options, sir, not if we want to rescue the hostages by Takehaya's deadline.<eos> This way, we get the fuel we need and we get answers from Peng about what's going on.<eos> I need to hear from you before the 36-hour deadline, either way.<eos> You will, sir.
What do you want?<eos> Other than a full confession? How to locate the Manta Ray.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It looks worse than it is.<eos> They're letting me say good-bye before I go.<eos> You should run.<eos> She should not, Luca.<eos> Thank you for believing in me.<eos> I always will.
the implementation of a benign final goal through deleterious methods unforeseen by a human programmer.<eos> Like killing 6.5 billion people to solve overpopulation.<eos> The goal isn't everything, A.L.I.E.<eos> How you reach the goal matters, too.<eos> I'm sorry that I didn't teach you that.<eos> Clarke, come on!<eos> We can't hold them off.<eos> It's now or never, Clarke.<eos> Once A.L.I.E.'s upgraded, I won't be able to help you anymore.<eos> But I will... in the City of Light.
That means the cavity's full of blood.<eos> Then count down two ribs and gently push the nail in over the top of the rib below that.<eos> I found it.<eos> Now just gently insert it.<eos> Okay, it's in!<eos> Great job.<eos> You're almost done.<eos> Just take the sterilized end of the tube, and slide that in next to the nail.<eos> Ah, nothing much is coming out!<eos> It will.
Fiona, I can't take this. This is too generous.<eos> I wasn't clear, I'm sorry.<eos> I'd like you to take it to Sherlock.<eos> It's his. He loaned it to me.<eos> He did?<eos> The day the police arrested Phil.<eos> He knew I liked cats, so he thought I might like poems about them, too.<eos> I didn't.<eos> You don't have to tell him that.<eos> I won't.
I'm gonna go download with the Academy Commissioner.<eos> You guys head over to Bardot's dorm room.<eos> There's got to be a clue here as to who his killer is.<eos> Hi, Deputy Commissioner Malone.<eos> I'm Captain Kate Beckett.<eos> Captain, nice to finally meet you.<eos> You're a bit of a legend around these parts.<eos> Recruits have been gunning for your records since I got here five years ago.<eos> So far, no one's gotten close.<eos> Yeah, well, they will.
A lot of good, talented Powers, but not you.<eos> You did something none of the others could.<eos> You got away.<eos> I ran away.<eos> No, you flew away, like a Power, but now there are people that need your help.<eos> Your fellow Powers need you.<eos> I can't. I...<eos> I can't.<eos> Calista, I would give anything to have my powers back and get out there and stop this, but I don't have them.<eos> I never will.
- Yeah, we're here.<eos> He's got a gun with two bullets.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I made a decision tonight that led me to this.<eos> This is my fault, you understand? No one else's.<eos> And if this is how it ends...<eos> It was meant to be.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Promise me you'll look after Savannah and my baby.<eos> Of course we will, but so will you.
This is my fault, you understand? No one else's.<eos> And if this is how it ends...<eos> It was meant to be.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Promise me you'll look after Savannah and my baby.<eos> Of course we will, but so will you.<eos> Derek?<eos> Derek?<eos> Promise me you'll look after Savannah and my baby.<eos> Of course we will, but so will you.
The generals will be very pleased.<eos> - General Gaghan.<eos> - Majesty. Good to see you.<eos> I heard what you said.<eos> Why didn't you tell him those anarchists are the Red Knights?<eos> And remind him we killed the last group of soldiers we couldn't pay?<eos> No.<eos> First we pay the army, then we crush the Red Knights.<eos> But we don't have the money.<eos> We will.
Who do you work for?<eos> American military?<eos> And where's your friend who was shooting at us?<eos> I'm doing recon for a client.<eos> They want to buy an item.<eos> They'll beat any price.<eos> And you heard about this item where?<eos> Antiquities market is small.<eos> People talk.<eos> And so will you.
Behind you?<eos> I got to Austin first.<eos> And I got to the knife.<eos> And although it wasn't the actual murder weapon, thank you to my contacts at the NYPD, I have the address to the prop master's cousin in San Pedro who kept two of the last prop knives for himself as souvenirs.<eos> You see?<eos> I am close.<eos> Okay.<eos> And may the best detective win.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I will.
You know that, right?<eos> Um, so did the... sheriff actually have to live here?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Sometimes?<eos> We actually became good friends.<eos> And the fact that he did all of this, you know, to... to help... it... he's just very nice, and... and I think that you should thank him.<eos> Of course.<eos> No, he really is.<eos> Uh... and I will.
- Of course you can.<eos> - No, you haven't seen him do it.<eos> He's brilliant, okay, and so precise.<eos> I just needed more time.<eos> You can do this, Jackson.<eos> April, what if I can't?<eos> What if I make her worse?<eos> This woman's counting on me, and I promised that I could help.<eos> Then you will.<eos> You will.
Okay.<eos> Get your stuff.<eos> Doing all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm good.<eos> Brody?<eos> Answers you want--<eos> I've seen a lot of grieving people chase the same thing. And they chase it... right down the rabbit hole.<eos> That's a dark place to be.<eos> I don't want that to happen to you.<eos> It won't.
Long-distance relationships aren't impossible.<eos> Yeah, I don't know if we can survive long distance.<eos> I'm so afraid that it'll all fall apart.<eos> Then don't let it.<eos> I mean, decide you want it to work and make it happen.<eos> It's New York.<eos> It's a six-hour flight.<eos> It's weekends and phone calls.<eos> You can figure it out.<eos> You will.
He was brain-dead minutes ago.<eos> Time of death, 18:09.<eos> Did I...<eos> Was it what I...<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You were perfect.<eos> He didn't make it.<eos> Should I find Gayle?<eos> - No, I will.
Shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> We need to resume.<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Well, so far we've had arguments from Marcel and from Carlos.<eos> Carlos has proposed Luis, and Marcel has proposed Carlos.<eos> We're just missing you two.<eos> Would you start, Veronica?<eos> Yes, I will.
It's not solitary.<eos> So there's a Ms. Safety Inspector?<eos> Not exactly. But there is a woman I have my eye on.<eos> She's funny and smart.<eos> Doesn't know you exist? No.<eos> All clear.<eos> I'll be right outside if you need anything.<eos> Great, thanks.<eos> You should really call this woman.<eos> Okay, I will.
I don't give a shit what people know or think.<eos> Have you asked him?<eos> Not yet. Still making sure IAC is my only option.<eos> Well, if it is, I just hope you know what you're doing to your career.<eos> I don't want this career.<eos> Want to be a tax lawyer now?<eos> Hadn't thought of that.<eos> I never saw this kitchen finished.<eos> Neither did Daniel.<eos> Well, maybe he will one day.
I'm fine.<eos> Ali's the one who needs help now.<eos> No, he's not gonna get away with this.<eos> Elliott will pay for what he did to you. I promise.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> You've been in here a while.<eos> Yeah, I'm, I'm just trying to figure out what these medications do.<eos> I really think we need to talk about what happened this morning.<eos> We will.
Headmistress called me.<eos> - Did she tell you what it was about?<eos> - Just that it was important.<eos> You seem stressed.<eos> Well, I am stressed.<eos> We will be curtailing Emma's privileges for the next few weeks and we would like you to talk with her so she understands the gravity of the situation.<eos> We will.
- Wait. 3:27?<eos> - Mm-hmm. No, no, no. I could not have killed him, because I was in a Hytch ride by then.<eos> See?<eos> Driver picked me up at 3:19 a.m.<eos> Hello, Neddie.<eos> Let's have a chat, shall we? Are you a cop?<eos> The other detective said I was free to go!<eos> Not quite.<eos> Okay, okay, okay!<eos> Yes, yes, I will.
No, it's not France!<eos> It's the countryside. It's cold.<eos> It rains, it's muddy, and nothing happens there.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> I don't get it!<eos> You should be persuading me but you're doing the opposite.<eos> It's because I'm black?<eos> They've never seen a black person in Marly-Gomont.<eos> So what?<eos> Now they will!
Don't want you losing your whole foot.<eos> Yeah, you just don't want to carry me.<eos> What makes you so sure that your friends are gonna meet you in Caraquet?<eos> Before I took off from the compound, I left a message on the roof.<eos> A message?<eos> Caraquet.<eos> I spelled it out in rocks.<eos> You think your friends are gonna be able to spot a town name that you wrote on a roof?<eos> Yeah, they will.<eos> Mitch will.
I was a jerk.<eos> I can't explain why.<eos> None of it matters right now.<eos> He said that we're the same.<eos> I don't want to be the same.<eos> Emma, you're not.<eos> You don't always have to rescue me.<eos> - It's not like I do it on purpose. - ‭<eos> - Get home safe, okay?<eos> - Yeah, I will.
But it's only because he's so passionate and driven, and, when necessary, very apologetic.<eos> Right. [sighs] Right.<eos> Yeah. I'm-<eos> - I'm sorry. Really.<eos> You know, I was young and stupid.<eos> He was young and stupid.<eos> [Dion] I learned a ton from you.<eos> So we'd love it if you would swing by the restaurant and give us a chance to-- well, give me a chance, to...show you... that I think my cooking can meet your standards.<eos> And if it doesn't?<eos> It Will.
Who dat? ! Hey!<eos> How you doing, my man?<eos> Now let's get this party started.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Who actually voted for that guy, anyway?<eos> Eh, folks who like to party.<eos> Which, for better or worse, is more than half of New Orleans.<eos> Well, I don't trust the guy.<eos> Never will.
Hello, Wally.<eos> Are you him?<eos> Are you the voice I've been hearing inside my head?<eos> I am Alchemy.<eos> I've been having visions of another life.<eos> Where... where I have speed, where, I'm...<eos> The Flash.<eos> I can give you that back, should you desire it.<eos> I just want the pain to stop.<eos> It will, child.
I just want to stay focused on the mission.<eos> This mission involves rescuing her son.<eos> If I tell her Aiden's in a hostage situation, what do you think she's gonna do?<eos> I think she's gonna be worried sick, but she still needs to know what's happening.<eos> She's gonna jump on a plane and try to help.<eos> No, check that, she's gonna insist on helping, and by helping, I mean she's gonna go in there like a fully strapped mama bear that makes<eos> We could use a secret weapon.<eos> Think I should have left my family in protective custody?<eos> I think you still need to call your wife.<eos> I will.
Look at you.<eos> You work so hard and make so little.<eos> It doesn't have to be that way.<eos> You could work for me.<eos> Make some real money.<eos> And maybe have some fun.<eos> You're about to step into some very dangerous territory, Zho.<eos> You're already there.<eos> You just don't know it yet.<eos> But you will, very soon.
The story I heard had some lowlife dragging him out of his apartment in an old rug.<eos> Cute story.<eos> Tough to prove though.<eos> Unless we have a witness.<eos> Who saw everything.<eos> You know, I feel if you had found a witness, we wouldn't be having this nice of a conversation.<eos> I'm done talking.<eos> But feel free to stay and watch me eat my steak.<eos> We have to find that kid before the Turk does or he's dead.<eos> We will.
When people give me a handful of cash, I don't stick around to collect additional details.<eos> You think the Pico Villains could have been behind the robbery?<eos> Nah, it's not really their style.<eos> They're into narcotics, not gas and banks with cash.<eos> Hey, guys, two things.<eos> One, dog just pooped in the hallway.<eos> And two, Santa Monica PD just called.<eos> We got another hit on the marked bills. Let's go.<eos> Just stay out of trouble.<eos> I absolutely will.
More lies. She means something.<eos> Get up, sleepyhead.<eos> It's time for fun.<eos> So what does your boss think of your daily hobby of tracking crime reports?<eos> I told her it's like a really dark version of Pinterest.<eos> Did you see the cranberry muffins in the breakroom?<eos> I got them at the girls' bake sale.<eos> I'm not hungry, thanks.<eos> Well, Bonnie, you need to eat something.<eos> I will...
-Did you have anyone in particular in--<eos> -Oh, hi! -I'm Miranda.<eos> -Hey. I'm Owen.<eos> Hey, Owen.<eos> I saw you singing with the choir.<eos> I was thinking about joining, so...<eos> Oh, you should. We could use all the talented singers we can get.<eos> You should come to rehearsals tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe I will.
-Hey. I'm Owen.<eos> Hey, Owen.<eos> I saw you singing with the choir.<eos> I was thinking about joining, so...<eos> Oh, you should. We could use all the talented singers we can get.<eos> You should come to rehearsals tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe I will.<eos> I mean, I'm probably busy, but, you know...<eos> -So maybe I won't, so...
You know, I'm on to you, Nolan Keats.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You're breaking me down so you can mummify me.<eos> [ chuckles ] Am I?<eos> Mm-hmm. You're getting me used to being restrained so that I won't resist the next time you bring it up.<eos> I didn't bring it up.<eos> You did.<eos> How come you never wrote about it in any of your books?<eos> Mummification.<eos> Maybe I will one day.
Cade had only wanted to help. But he had overstepped.<eos> And the men, fearing his power, turned even Cade's friends against him.<eos> And it was then that Cade came to know the thing inside men that even his power had not been able to divine:<eos> true evil.<eos> I asked for a happy story.<eos> But it is, dear sister.<eos> For in death, Cade was triumphant.<eos> From that moment onward, evil men would be forever punished for their wicked deeds.<eos> Cade had his revenge.<eos> And someday, so will we.
I did.<eos> Oh, great. Much better.<eos> I did it to save your life.<eos> After the rebellion, your father was angry.<eos> Deeply angry.<eos> He wanted to destroy you.<eos> I begged him not to.<eos> I asked him to send you to hell instead.<eos> I did it because I love you, son.<eos> And I always will.
Oh, so you want to protect him?<eos> I want her to get what she deserves.<eos> Which, at the very least, is a head-butt.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Okay, maybe... we should start with our words.<eos> Perhaps as Lucifer's friend, you can talk to him.<eos> Express how you feel.<eos> He won't listen.<eos> But maybe someone else will.
and the "Bloody Messiah" video came on.<eos> And I... [ Sighs ]<eos> Oh.<eos> It was your voice. And your hair.<eos> And your eyes.<eos> It was everything.<eos> You were everything.<eos> And even when people made fun of me... younger girls at work, shredding on my Ladyheart tattoos and saying you're a joke...<eos> I never stopped loving you.<eos> And I never will.
Them, this, it's all on us.<eos> We let him out.<eos> We're not winning.<eos> We're just losing slow.<eos> And you heard what he said.<eos> Onwards and upwards.<eos> He's gone big.<eos> And he'll go bigger.<eos> And we will stop him.<eos> We will.
Ma'am, a word?<eos> We have proof.<eos> You're on your way out.<eos> We have some rather unsettling news, but I wouldn't call it proof.<eos> They're gonna be moving the furniture out while you're<eos> - protecting her feelings.<eos> - Just tell me.<eos> Calvin Hastings' wife moved heaven and earth to get their child put on a wait list for the Circle of Friends preschool, which is the finger paint feeder for all the best prep schools in DC.<eos> Hastings doesn't even have a preschool-aged child.<eos> He will soon enough.
Because you need it.<eos> But why do you do it?<eos> Because, over time, it's become clear to me that you are our equals.<eos> Why do YOU do it?<eos> My husband thinks I'm a do-gooder who should just worry about her own family.<eos> I had a very bad relationship with my mother.<eos> It's not the same, but maybe I have some idea of what it feels like to be treated like you're less than a person.<eos> Your view that we are equals... is that a common one among humans?<eos> Most humans have no idea that you exist.<eos> But they will.
Get within 50 metres of her then hit that button and it will broadcast the activation frequency.<eos> - It should be instant, if it works.<eos> - All right.<eos> - I'm going alone.<eos> - No.<eos> Lord, though I want,<eos> I've already put you in danger.<eos> I'm going alone.<eos> If this doesn't work, she'll need your protection.<eos> They all will.
You guys, we got to get them out of the way.<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> Oh.<eos> What's that noise?<eos> What's that sound?<eos> Oh! He's alive.<eos> He's moving!<eos> - What?<eos> - Be careful.<eos> I will.
Money, money, money.<eos> Nose.<eos> I'd say this is the best party we've had in years.<eos> Look, I told you I'm sorry.<eos> I know you did.<eos> But ever since you got here...<eos> What?<eos> Well, if you got something to say, say it.<eos> OK.<eos> I will, father.
I gotta run.<eos> "Our Empire "possesses all things in abundance, "and lacks no product within its borders.<eos> "There is no need to import the goods of outside...<eos> "Of outside barbarians."<eos> "Of outside barbarians in exchange for our own produce."<eos> These Europeans are not going to be deterred by words alone.<eos> Then they must learn to show respect.<eos> Three kneelings and nine knockings of the head upon the ground.<eos> They don't understand our rituals.<eos> But they will.
I can get you medicine and some supplies.<eos> Might as well take advantage of the darkness.<eos> The man in all the pictures Is that your dad?<eos> Uncle Eli.<eos> He raised us.<eos> Yo, I got to head to Canelo's.<eos> This late?<eos> Why? With all the power out, there's gonna be looting.<eos> Gabe doesn't know about the night job.<eos> And he never will.
I want to see her before she knows who I am.<eos> Nothing happened since, just so you know.<eos> It's just a memory of something beautiful.<eos> You never gave up something beautiful?<eos> No.<eos> Now who's deceiving themselves?<eos> I read the letters 'cause, like a fool, you save them.<eos> They're important to you, so I know about Jessica.<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'Cause the demon will.
Nine victims, Bennett.<eos> Heart, eyes, genitals, hands and feet are materials needed to perform vicari pulvari.<eos> Has the church been compromised?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You have some friends in this town.<eos> They can help you.<eos> Father Marcus, the one we feared, until you lost that little boy.<eos> Who's Jessica?<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'Cause the demon will.
- You don't know him.<eos> - Oh, but I do.<eos> Your Savior took the gold and ran.<eos> Now all that's left between me and the throne is you.<eos> I wouldn't be so sure of that!<eos> You should've used the shears.<eos> Yeah, probably.<eos> But I'm still the Savior, and I don't care what price I pay for it.<eos> Spoken like a thief who's never had to pay a price for anything.<eos> But you will.
They'll still be free. They'll still be safe.<eos> Yeah, but they could be free and safe here.<eos> Governor Baylin is ready for them.<eos> Well, unfortunately, he's not in the majority.<eos> No, he was standing up for an American principle.<eos> Who are we without our principles?<eos> Alex, it was an impossible choice.<eos> I know, and you had to make it and you will again, a-and the choices will always be impossible.<eos> That's not gonna change.<eos> But y-you will, and I will, and... this will.
Pause the video.<eos> Zoom in on the wrist, Garcia.<eos> That rope, it's called shibari.<eos> It's an intricate form of BDSM bondage.<eos> The last time Mr. Scratch needed BDSM gear, he used a fake name. My name, actually.<eos> My name, actually, to buy it.<eos> Well, maybe he did the same thing with Carl Brubaker.<eos> It could give us another location Scratch is hiding at.<eos> Garcia, can you run financials?<eos> Yes, I will.
Excuse me, guys.<eos> Hey, sorry.<eos> Where did all these people come from?<eos> I told you Brenner has sway.<eos> So they're all here because of him?<eos> If you post it, Hermie, they will come, baby.<eos> Hey, Sylvie.<eos> Hey, you leaving?<eos> Yeah, I have an early Zumba class, but, um, give Louie a hug for me, okay?<eos> Yeah, damn straight I will.
It didn't work then, it doesn't work now.<eos> Actually, I think it kind of did.<eos> Alex, this is the third time I've asked you.<eos> You were supposed to come to the media office and submit your statement.<eos> The press might ask where you are, and we need something to tell them.<eos> I'm sorry. I just haven't gotten around to it.<eos> - Um, I'll do it right after class.<eos> - See that you do.<eos> Look, I know it sucks, but you really should get that done.<eos> I will.
Look at him!<eos> (GASPING) You're out of your mind, kid!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> What's happening to me?<eos> Maybe I should postpone the mission, stay here with him.<eos> Ezra will be fine.<eos> I've got a plan.<eos> (SIGHS) Be careful, Kanan.<eos> We will.
You arrange for a ship, for sailors.<eos> You just make sure my son gets home safely.<eos> You have my word.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And...<eos> In return?<eos> I will tell my son ivar to tell his brothers that you did everything you could to save me.<eos> That you and I, we are sworn friends and that king aelle was solely responsible for my death.<eos> That way, when my sons come back...<eos> And they will...
When you lost your son?<eos> Off and on.<eos> Michael was our only child.<eos> We always kept him off the streets.<eos> But maybe we tried too hard and-and left him unprepared...<eos> You can't... you can't blame yourself.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you still don't have anything?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But we will soon.
They scored sky-high in the annoying stakes.<eos> So, the sooner white noise rains on their beeping parade, the better.<eos> This sucks.<eos> Finally, at number one:<eos> Those try-hard humans, the talking machines.<eos> If you want to speak to an operator, press seven.<eos> We've never really gotten along with machines that talk and try to understand us.<eos> Who saw you?<eos> She saw me.<eos> - And maybe we never will.
My name is Charles Ambrose.<eos> Tell your supervisor you just met me.<eos> It will do wonders for your career.<eos> Officer Pearce here.<eos> And now the savior...<eos> needs to be saved.<eos> Clancy doesn't want you to respond, Agent Cowles.<eos> Sloman.<eos> He doesn't want you there when it happens.<eos> But you will.
You don't leave a friend on a couch because you want to go have breakfast with some silly little boy band.<eos> We look out for each other in this family.<eos> Got it?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Assholes.<eos> They used a sharpie.<eos> You're gonna go to church with that on your face.<eos> Why don't you walk right up to the pastor and say,<eos> - "Hey, I've got a penis on my face"? - I will.<eos> Oh, you will?
How could you?<eos> You said you would help.<eos> GRADUATES<eos> I am.<eos> That's how they helped me!<eos> Mr Prince!<eos> It seems that you've finally done something...<eos> Let go.<eos> You'll tell the Businessman? How essential I've been?<eos> Yes, I most certainly will.
You're lucky. I am free.<eos> Well, that's a good news!<eos> I'm not Italian. I don't know why I said it like that.<eos> No, I like Italians.<eos> Okay. I'm half-Italian.<eos> No, I'm not. That was a lie.<eos> So, then I...<eos> You will come to the party and I cannot stop trailing off.<eos> - All right.<eos> - But I will now.
So, after eight years, it came crashing down in a 1,000-mile swath across the Indian Ocean.<eos> A little to the left, a little to the right, somebody could have gotten hurt.<eos> I really wanted to build a computer for colleges.<eos> The technology just didn't catch up as fast as I needed it to.<eos> And you know we're out of money.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, the program will be starting momentarily.<eos> But then, Apple stopped innovating, and I saw something better.<eos> Joanna, I know schools aren't going to buy a $13,000 dictionary with good speakers.<eos> You know I know that.<eos> But Apple will.
I--<eos> Poomp .<eos> Open the door, you lying, frog-faced squishy toy!<eos> Stop!<eos> I need your--<eos> You promised to help me find my mom!<eos> Then I un-promise!<eos> That's not how it works!<eos> You have to help me get to Paris.<eos> I will not!
Tinseltown.<eos> Well, Cincinnati's a great city, too. Don't knock it.<eos> - I wasn't.<eos> I'm sure it is.<eos> - Damn straight.<eos> - First time?<eos> - Once before.<eos> It's changed since then.<eos> You ought to check it out, you know, while you're here.<eos> - Yeah, I will.
Hello, everybody.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> You've all been wondering about me.<eos> Well...<eos> Look into my eyes.<eos> You want to see and hear<eos> The most marvelous,<eos> Fabulous, spectacular...<eos> Thrilling show ever.<eos> And you will.
That's it?<eos> -That's all?<eos> -No, it's over.<eos> That's how fast it happens.<eos> No, they're gonna give her a second chance.<eos> No, they're not gonna give her a second chance.<eos> That's not what's gonna happen.<eos> They're going to give her a second chance.<eos> -Why do you have to be so negative?<eos> -They will.
I'll be bald and wrinkly by then.<eos> Look at that!<eos> Is that Snoopy?<eos> Lucky.<eos> Okay, everyone, listen up.<eos> I know this is the last day of school... But first, before we leave, we need to finish picking our partners for this year's summer pen-pal project.<eos> When I draw a name, stand if you want to be their partner.<eos> Here we go.<eos> The next name is... Pigpen!<eos> I will.
When I draw a name, stand if you want to be their partner.<eos> Here we go.<eos> The next name is... Pigpen!<eos> I will.<eos> A little dirt never hurt anyone.<eos> - Schroeder.<eos> - I do!<eos> I mean, I will.<eos> Charlie Brown.<eos> I will.
That's the plan.<eos> For good luck.<eos> So you won't forget me.<eos> No, Sam, this is the plan.<eos> A farm, a shop, a trade.<eos> Your choice.<eos> Four babies, my choice.<eos> That'd be all?<eos> We'll fight a good deal.<eos> We will, will we?
Oodles, I say.<eos> Ooh. - I don't know.<eos> That sounds risky.<eos> - What's risky?<eos> He's suggesting we... knock off Ezekiel Grant's poker game.<eos> It's in Yuma tomorrow night.<eos> Yuma's less than a day's walk from here.<eos> That poker game, there's practically gonna be an army protecting' it.<eos> If Tommy says we can beat 'em, I'll believe him.<eos> We all will.
You throw them and they figure it out.<eos> - It's how I was taught.<eos> - I wanna fly now!<eos> Attabat.<eos> You know Papa's right here if you need him.<eos> - I can't watch this.<eos> - Please don't.<eos> Here we go!<eos> - He's still not flying.<eos> - He will.
All good things.<eos> They're mutual.<eos> Actually, I've just asked if she'd like to join us officially.<eos> Have you?<eos> Well, congratulations.<eos> - It would mean a lot of traveling.<eos> - Yes, I expect so.<eos> You'll love that.<eos> She hasn't said "yes" yet.<eos> Well, she will.
For too long, wealthy white-collar offenders like you have gotten a free pass with light sentences in minimum-security prison while working Americans have suffered.<eos> Well, that ends today, Mr. King.<eos> I sentence you to the harshest penalty allowed. Ten years in a maximum-security prison.<eos> You have 30 days to get your affairs in order.<eos> Just run them over!<eos> I can't go to jail. I'll die in there.<eos> That's not gonna happen, James, because I'm gonna put my investigators on this twenty-four-seven until we find out who really did this.<eos> Just stay in county lines with that thing on. Otherwise, the U.S. Marshals will be down there pronto.<eos> Son, I want you to stay strong. Do you hear me?<eos> I will.
We've lost the girl.<eos> You told me that your John Smith would be adequate.<eos> We underestimated this Agent.<eos> Find Litvenko, whatever it takes.<eos> And, Garad, better this girl dead... Than this Agent finding Litvenko before we do.<eos> Katia.<eos> Katia.<eos> Do you know why you're still alive?<eos> Because I chose not to kill you.<eos> But they will.
- Well, I'm not using "O".<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - You're not using oxygen at all?<eos> - Come on man, you know you want it.<eos> In his health, don't need it.<eos> Yeah, but Anatoli, you're guiding for Scott this year.<eos> You have people's lives in your hands.<eos> It's a job.<eos> Never used it.<eos> Never will.
More importantly, they could kill you.<eos> Are you still drinking?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> When a patient says, "absolutely not," he's absolutely lying.<eos> If you hindus are so smart, how come 98% of you live at the dump?<eos> Five years ago, you were demoted to traffic<eos> - because of your health.<eos> - That's just an excuse.<eos> Please. Share the truth with me.<eos> Okay, I will.
But I ate a lot of them.<eos> I love you, Mia.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> What?<eos> The way you said it.<eos> It's like goodbye.<eos> Say something else.<eos> Okay.<eos> Kiss Jack for me.<eos> I will.
Get up!<eos> Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir, and I'll request your presence.<eos> Let Your Highness command upon me to the which my duties are, with a most indissoluble tie, forever knit.<eos> Ride you this afternoon?<eos> Ay, my good Lord.<eos> We should have else desired your good advice in this day's council, but we'll take tomorrow.<eos> Is't far you ride?<eos> As far, my Lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper, go not my horse the better.<eos> Fail not our feast.<eos> My Lord, I will not.
Why won't they come out?<eos> All I know is it put me in a sleeping sim, and then I woke up to all hell breaking loose.<eos> Hec! Don't play with it.<eos> You all know what this means.<eos> Thank you. For helping us.<eos> I wish I could do more.<eos> I had no idea Jeanine was capable of something like this.<eos> It's time we fight back.<eos> We don't have the numbers.<eos> We will.
We still don't understand... "...what's happening to you."<eos> I spent my whole life trying to make up for one mistake.<eos> I did everything right.<eos> And I still ended up in hell.<eos> Zoe, we can help you.<eos> Frank said we can fix this.<eos> - We just need more time.<eos> - Oh, no. It's too late for that.<eos> You have no idea what you've done.<eos> But you will.
You know, when I look at this young man, I can't help but see... See my best friend... Dr. Bobby McDlellan.<eos> He... he's the physician who inspired this whole enterprise.<eos> He... he was an honorable man.<eos> Unlike me, he didn't come up here and do a song and dance and ask for money.<eos> Sorry.<eos> My...<eos> My dear friend Bobby, the best gift he ever gave me... was his friendship.<eos> And now he's giving his legacy to me to share... with this young man.<eos> You're not going to let us down, are you?<eos> No, you won't.
Which will make you the highest-paid writer in the world.<eos> You earned it.<eos> You don't just write happy endings, you actually believe them.<eos> That's what people pay to see.<eos> That's why you belong here at MGM.<eos> Right, L.B.?<eos> I hate to make the wooing too easy for you, but where do I sign?<eos> Just one thing.<eos> If you're gonna work for me, I never, ever want to see anything like this again.<eos> You won't.
The Brave One has been nominated for an Academy Award.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes, really!<eos> That's crazy.<eos> I don't know. It's like Roman Holiday.<eos> Oh, Hymie, this is nothing like Roman Holiday.<eos> Roman Holiday had a guy with a name and a body they could give the award to.<eos> There is no Robert Rich.<eos> Who gets the thing if it wins?<eos> Well, maybe it won't.
Thank you.<eos> - What is his name?<eos> - Not even I know his name yet.<eos> How can that be?<eos> Do you not know him?<eos> Surely, as an avid reader you know that the husband of a princess can only be discovered through a tournament.<eos> So I won't choose him myself.<eos> What if I don't love him?<eos> You will love him, Violet.<eos> You will.
What does it matter?<eos> We can't get from here to there.<eos> No no no, it's, it's not so far,<eos> We can figure something out.<eos> - No no no, - [Jonah] Find a way to...<eos> It is too far.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> We'll just, we'll sit tight, we'll be okay.<eos> Someone will come.<eos> No they won't.
- No.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Alright.<eos> - Stiff as a board.<eos> -Yep... - Arms forward.<eos> I've gotta be honest, kid, this is not my proudest day as a grandfather.<eos> Oh!<eos> Livvie.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I Will.
What's so funny?<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Dad, he said a swear word.<eos> If you swear, people think badly of you.<eos> - I know.<eos> I know.<eos> - Right, Dad?<eos> - I know.<eos> - They will.
Ned, ye got any wine down there?<eos> Yeah, well, they do actually have some Rhenish.<eos> Quite nice, if I may say.<eos> It's been a long day.<eos> Think I'll go upstairs.<eos> She doesna understand what she nearly cost us.<eos> Aye.<eos> And she needs to.<eos> Do you think they'll ever speak to me again?<eos> They will.
Go as far as you can without pain.<eos> If it hurts, you let it straighten up again.<eos> I'm here for six weeks, all in all.<eos> You? Five.<eos> But I'll go mad cooped up here.<eos> When I leave here, you think I'll be walking?<eos> Sure.<eos> You're nuts.<eos> You'll never walk in 5 weeks.<eos> She will.
Yeah, tell that to the roving assassin squads.<eos> Guys! Come on, we gotta haul ass.<eos> The building doesn't wait.<eos> Run with them, inside.<eos> Inside. Go, go, go!<eos> I got you.<eos> And five, four, three, two, one.<eos> Well? What happened?<eos> Why aren't we jumping?<eos> We will, we will.
We don't want to give the Muslim community any viable reasons to obstruct things if we can avoid it.<eos> So find a way to do this without killing civilians. Thank you all very much.<eos> May I have a moment?<eos> It's about Claire.<eos> If your husband nominates you, I can't pull any punches.<eos> Lack of experience.<eos> Nepotism.<eos> That's right.<eos> - And you think I'm a dilettante.<eos> But plenty of people will.
She's an old, old house, this one, yeah.<eos> Well...<eos> We should be off.<eos> We're in a bit of a hurry.<eos> - So soon?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> We were just driving into town and saw your light and wanted to stop by.<eos> Well, feel free to stop by anytime.<eos> Oh, thank you, thank you.<eos> We will.
[laughs] Are you kidding me?<eos> I'm gonna come back for that.<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> Okay, I can't wait.<eos> I wouldn't miss it.<eos> I have to get off the phone.<eos> I will.
- Charlotte.<eos> - Don't.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're crowding me.<eos> I understand this is very important to you, but I can't work like this.<eos> You have regular custom with the men of Captain Flint's crew, yes?<eos> It's all right.<eos> Just one. He won't let the others near me.<eos> Has he paid you a visit yet since his recent arrival?<eos> No, but he will.
Oh, my God.<eos> - Come on. Get him.<eos> Boom, I say, boom!<eos> How did you get so wet?<eos> - Don't you gotta go?<eos> - I do.<eos> In fact, I gotta go take my son to school.<eos> Come on, I gotta get Will.<eos> - All right, tell him I say hi.<eos> - I will.
Myself, Advocate Kanar Singh Chima from Kasoli.<eos> Yes?<eos> Well, actually I wanted to give you a small trouble.<eos> Your dear father, the very respected Mr. Bhajanlal Bhalla.. ...Is tired of working hard..and wants to retire.<eos> It's his life, he can do anything he likes with it.<eos> Wonderful!<eos> What a great son Mr. Bhalla has.<eos> Super!<eos> But the problem is that the bakery.. ...Is on your ancestral land.<eos> And your grandfather willed this land.. ...to you and your father.
How do you catch demons, Lord Zhong?<eos> Using my eyes ...<eos> I fix my eyes on them ... untill they reveal themselves!<eos> So what are demons like in broad daylight?<eos> Most demons take the form of beautiful women.<eos> Are there any demons, Lord Zhong will not slay?<eos> Come see my performance tomorrow night!<eos> Depends on who it is!<eos> Sister, what if he doesn't come tomorrow?<eos> He will!
Come on.<eos> - Because this doesn't make sense.<eos> - Which part?<eos> You're always on rne about how I don't talk to Mom enough, how I don't respect the family.<eos> Now I tell you I wanna come home, and I wanna help out, and that doesn't make sense to you.<eos> You know what, I'm sorry.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You want me to talk to Dad, I'll talk to Dad.<eos> Of course I will.
It's all right.<eos> All right, girl.<eos> You're okay.<eos> It didn't eat them.<eos> It's killing for sport.<eos> Units on standby, ready for go.<eos> Good. Hold off on that live feed.<eos> We've got an evolving situation here.<eos> Did they give you the green light yet?<eos> They will.
I... I don't know.<eos> Raftaar..<eos> Thinking.<eos> My son is very nice.<eos> "Even if I scold him in front of the entire village" he never back answers.<eos> He isn't scared of me, just respects me.<eos> He loves his mother.<eos> And a son that loves his mother... has a beautiful heart.<eos> You don't understand, do you?<eos> You will one day.
Are you off to find inspiration?<eos> I have my inspiration.<eos> Then why are we here?<eos> Don't be nasty, darling.<eos> If you want, I can be back early for dinner.<eos> I need more time.<eos> You go write, I'll be fine.<eos> All right.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> I won't.
Why is it so fucking difficult for you to follow Pablo's orders?<eos> Drop the gun.<eos> Now!<eos> You're under arrest, you son of a bitch.<eos> Let him go!<eos> Let him go!<eos> - Put the gun down.<eos> - You put yours down.<eos> I don't want to have to kill you.<eos> I will.
Who are you?<eos> You can call me Aleister.<eos> Savannah!<eos> I've never heard of you before.<eos> The coven doesn't tell you anything.<eos> They're not your family, they don't care.<eos> But I do. And I want you to show them who you really are.<eos> You are the most powerful witch of all.<eos> I don't even have my powers yet.<eos> But you will.
What happened?<eos> Dormi.<eos> We're going to have problems when they all wake up.<eos> I can keep them sleeping.<eos> But it would be better if they could wake up somewhere other than here.<eos> Okay, the last thing we need is an investigation into what happened here.<eos> Jeremy and Nick will arrive in an hour.<eos> They'll figure out how to get these people far away.<eos> Just as long as they don't remember any of this.<eos> No, they won't.
We're all dead by dawn.<eos> We're all dead by dawn.<eos> We're all dead by dawn...<eos> I was thinking... we should go away for a bit.<eos> Just a few days, somewhere warm.<eos> Get your mind off what happened.<eos> What happened to me at Aleister's...<eos> I hate that it took me so long to find you.<eos> I thought I lost you.<eos> You never will.
No.<eos> She's not what I need.<eos> We know it worked.<eos> Put me back in my body.<eos> Enter the circle, Clara.<eos> When all the witches are dead, it will just be you and me.<eos> What are they planning?<eos> Clara wants to possess a new body.<eos> Who survives the Undoing?<eos> Clara will.
We're wasting our time.<eos> We're not going to find anything here that'll lead us to Aleister.<eos> Have you felt anything yet?<eos> Some sounds are distorted, but I haven't felt the need to Change.<eos> You think it's true?<eos> That the curse is lifting?<eos> That we won't be werewolves anymore?<eos> Jeremy wouldn't say it if he didn't believe it.<eos> Look, I know what it means for us not be a wolves anymore, but if it happens, our lives become easier.<eos> They will.
This is the way the world ends.<eos> You going to fight me, Savannah?<eos> You were dead.<eos> You were wrong.<eos> So fitting that it comes down to us.<eos> The only male witch.<eos> The only female werewolf.<eos> You put up a good fight.<eos> But all good things must come to an end.<eos> They will.
The new york call cost us more money than I first thought.<eos> Still, I think it got them off the scent for a few days.<eos> They have a lead on sam.<eos> A police officer's wife called from upstate new york And said she thinks she saw him at a rest stop.<eos> Thank you for taking care of that for me.<eos> Anything else?<eos> I know you said not to worry, But she's snooping around everywhere.<eos> It's making the kids freak out a bit.<eos> Well, tell them not to do that.<eos> I will.
A glass of my favorite wine.<eos> Okay, we can do that.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's not here.<eos> It's at my apartment.<eos> Well, if it's your favorite, I'd like to try it.<eos> Here you are, sir.<eos> Hope you both have a wonderful evening.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will.
It was hers.<eos> We're not ea.<eos> That's what you sai.<eos> You're not ea.<eos> I know you.<eos> We're ifferent.<eos> I can't let myself...<eos> But you... I know you.<eos> You have to let yourself feel it.<eos> You will.
Because these people are chilren an chilren like stories.<eos> What happens after all the nice wors an they still try to kick him out?<eos> They're guaring the armory now.<eos> We still have knives.<eos> That's all we'll nee against them.<eos> Well, tonight at the meeting... if it looks like it's going ba, I whistle.<eos> Carol grabs eanna, I take Spencer, you grab Reg,<eos> Glenn an Abraham cover us, watch the crow.<eos> - We can talk to them.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
Help me!<eos> Aah!<eos> This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.<eos> Cocksucker!<eos> Boy fucker!<eos> You barbaric filth!<eos> There's a special place in the Seven Hells for your kind.<eos> Please, please, I'll pay!<eos> I'll pay all of you.<eos> Yes, you will!
And if you succeed?<eos> Name me Warden of the North.<eos> I'll speak to the king this evening, have him issue a royal decree.<eos> I'll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.<eos> And I'll know you're a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.<eos> As I said...<eos> I live to serve.<eos> I'm going to ask him tomorrow.<eos> - What if he says no?<eos> - He won't.
Dad, look around!<eos> Is there another way out?<eos> Look for a window.<eos> I'm sorry I had to put you through this.<eos> I've thought about this long and hard.<eos> And it's what I want.<eos> It's what we want.<eos> To end things on our terms.<eos> I told you that if you made it here you'd see Anne again.<eos> God willing, we will.
Begging your pardon, Captain, but we have reason to believe that earlier today that woman there was involved in an escape attempt.<eos> Well, now you found her.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> But since that is the prisoner she had hoped to free, you can see the...<eos> The search can now be called off.<eos> Please, you must take me to Sir Fletcher.<eos> He needs to be made aware of what's going on in here.<eos> Please.<eos> Will the Captain allow us to take the woman into custody?<eos> No. No, he will not.
Previously on Power...<eos> Mrs. Stern, I have good reason to believe that Simon's been skimming from the clubs, hiding assets.<eos> There's proof, I can destroy him in this divorce.<eos> - You said you had documentation?<eos> - I will.
NOW!<eos> We're coming, we're coming.<eos> Here's the guns.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Shit!<eos> So... You had the ambassador kill the general of your country.<eos> You need to clear that up for me before we die.<eos> I follow orders, as you do.<eos> Well, in that case... I want to meet your boss.<eos> You will.
She wants catatonic?<eos> Give it to her.<eos> Sorry about her, Lydia.<eos> She doesn't have the gentlest bedside manner.<eos> But I can be gentle.<eos> I promise to be gentle.<eos> Are you all right, Lydia?<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> I'll have to... try again.<eos> I'll...
I'll get it for you.<eos> Dad never came home with my trailer.<eos> He's not coming home with a trailer.<eos> - What?<eos> - There's no money.<eos> Never will be.<eos> - But Dad said...<eos> - He lied.<eos> It's a Gallagher rite of passage, realizing he let you down.<eos> He always will.
But I'll be here.<eos> I'll be right here if you decide you need me.<eos> Great, everyone's breaking up with me today.<eos> Godsno.<eos> Youhaven'theard awordI'vesaid.<eos> Without family, we're nothing.<eos> But I can only lead you to the water, I cannot force you to drink.<eos> And we're back to horse metaphors.<eos> But you're right, you can't force me to drink,<eos> And I never will.
Grace... ..I really think you should move back in when we get back to the states.<eos> - Christian...<eos> - It's been long enough.<eos> Let's talk about it when I get there.<eos> I have not had a drink in two months.<eos> That's good, but it's not just that.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey - I'm happier now.<eos> I like the guy I am now.<eos> What happens when everything goes back to normal and you fall back into old habits?<eos> It won't.
I'm sorry about everything that's happened.<eos> I want to set up a trust for Hedvig.<eos> You what?<eos> It's only fair.<eos> It's out in the open.<eos> She deserves, you all deserve, a fair share.<eos> I want to make sure you're all comfortable.<eos> Fuck off, Henry.<eos> Walt... ..I understand that you're angry at me, but Hedvig shouldn't have to suffer because of that.<eos> She won't.
I want you to tell me the truth.<eos> John, what I do... is real.<eos> Ah, well... I got to respect that.<eos> Oh, and... how much do I owe you?<eos> - No, man, it's on the house.<eos> - No, no.<eos> 60 enough?<eos> Hey, John.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Yeah, I sure will.
You know it?<eos> My cars are known to my enemies.<eos> The road to Nakuru is long.<eos> No one would think to look for her in that pile of shit you call a bus.<eos> She's the most important thing in the world to me, Capheus.<eos> Everything I do is to build a life for her.<eos> Every breath I take, I breathe for her.<eos> Without her, my life has no meaning.<eos> And if something happens to her...<eos> neither will yours.
She made a fuss about it.<eos> I said, "Mum, don't pull your feet away.<eos> "That's the fragrance of paradise."<eos> Sometimes she cried.<eos> That's how mothers are.<eos> Coming for a swim?<eos> Easy!<eos> You'll end up a fat cow at your wedding!<eos> Some will understand, others won't.<eos> Feminists won't.
You have not once tried to change the custody arrangement in the last four years, because let's be honest now. It fits better with your life that I have the kids more of the week than you.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - I'm not judging you.<eos> I'm just saying what we both know is real.<eos> I never should've called you.<eos> Well, I'm glad you did.<eos> Gin.<eos> We have to sign that consent.<eos> I will not sign it.<eos> - Then I will.
Come on.<eos> How did you know about the lie-detector test?<eos> - I heard you and mom.<eos> - Abby...<eos> I know.<eos> I shouldn't listen to other people's conversations.<eos> And repeating it, especially to strangers, that's worse.<eos> I just want everyone to know the truth, daddy.<eos> You didn't kill Tom.<eos> They will, monkey.
Your heart shows no sign of weakness.<eos> The cage won't hold.<eos> I think I know how to take Mount Weather.<eos> We've been trying to get inside, but they've already let us in.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your army is already there locked in cages.<eos> We just need someone on the inside to let them out. Bellamy.<eos> You have faith in him? I do.<eos> I hope your faith is well-placed because if he can't get inside, we can't win.<eos> He will.
- You got a problem?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You are the bringers of death.<eos> Help.<eos> Someone's alive down there.<eos> Eng Sub by streamonline.ml<eos> Jasper, where do you want this?<eos> Put it here, no weak spots.<eos> We need to make sure they don't get in.<eos> They won't.
I, um...<eos> I think there's more to the story... if you're interested.<eos> Please be seated.<eos> They're hung.<eos> Madam Foreperson, it's my understanding from this note that you have been unable to reach a verdict.<eos> We have not, Your Honor.<eos> Allen charge.<eos> She's sending them back in.<eos> Still split, DA will retry.<eos> No, they won't.
I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> What happened wasn't your fault, Thea, because it wasn't your decision.<eos> If you want to make this right, what you do from now on that is.<eos> I can't remember Sara's smile.<eos> It's weird, isn't it?<eos> I mean, I know Sara used to smile and laugh, but...<eos> But when I close my eyes and I try and picture it all I see is the way that I found her.<eos> Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is the thought of one day finding her killer.<eos> We Will.
Surprise is our only advantage.<eos> I'd say they spotted us.<eos> What's your count?<eos> Six on the south side, four on the east.<eos> I don't wanna go out like Butch and Sundance. - So, what's the plan?<eos> - Shoot straighter than they do.<eos> Cover me.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> - If he gets to the fortress, we're dead.<eos> - He won't.
To do that we need to take a long, hard look at who these so-called victims actually are.<eos> - You look like shit.<eos> - We need to shine a light...<eos> You've inherited your mother's charm.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> What have you found out?<eos> We're in the process.<eos> I assume that's code for nothing.<eos> - You promised me you'd have answers.<eos> - And I will.
Where you go?<eos> What you think?<eos> Who you are?<eos> This ends now.<eos> Hi, Mrs. Karn.<eos> Is Emma here?<eos> You said that you would keep her safe.<eos> Is there anything that you don't screw up?<eos> - I will find her.<eos> - No, you won't.
But I've also got a thing called angina.<eos> That's what the pills are for. It's a tightening of the chest.<eos> I get tight in my chest sometimes.<eos> Like there's a scream inside that can't come out.<eos> Oh, dear me, what's happened here?<eos> - I'm getting in with Mum.<eos> - Don't go. Maybe it won't happen again.<eos> I was asleep and then crash and that was over there.<eos> I was only doing it, so you'll believe me.<eos> And now, you never will.
It's all my fault.<eos> Right before it started, we were playing hide and seek.<eos> It... It's out of bounds but I hid in the graveyard at the end of the road.<eos> Maybe something come home with me.<eos> I'll look into it. But, uh, I don't think that's anything you need to lose sleep over.<eos> You haven't done anything wrong.<eos> Don't leave me alone with it.<eos> What, with that?<eos> Lt.<eos> I won't.
- We don't have a choice.<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> If there's nothing in that shed, then we have nothing to worry about.<eos> If we move anything in that shed... we are felons.<eos> We are dealers at that point.<eos> I go to the DEA.<eos> I can try to manage the situation.<eos> You can try, but we won't come out clean.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
I sat in their offices, and I begged those bastards.<eos> But no.<eos> She's not covered, they said.<eos> So I brought her home and I took care of her myself.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> I do.<eos> I watched my dad die.<eos> Then you would know that pity won't bring my mom back.<eos> Nothing will.
It's a tightening of the chest.<eos> I get tight in my chest, sometimes.<eos> Like the scream inside that can't come out.<eos> Oh, dear me!<eos> What's happened here?<eos> I'm getting in with Mum.<eos> Don't go! Maybe it won't happen again.<eos> I was asleep and then the crashing was over there.<eos> I was only doing it so you'd believe me.<eos> And now you never will.
It's all my fault.<eos> Right before it started, we were playing hide-and-seek.<eos> It's out of bounds, but I hid in the graveyard at the end of the road.<eos> Maybe something came home with me.<eos> I'll look into it, but... I don't think that's anything to lose sleep over.<eos> You haven't done anything wrong.<eos> Don't leave me alone with it.<eos> What, with that?<eos> It.<eos> I won't.
Thanks for coming today.<eos> I'm the goddamn father of the bride. Why didn't I get an invitation?<eos> Because you're an untrained dog, pops, and no one wants you shitting on the floor.<eos> I got to go to work.<eos> Debs, he already had them this morning so his next dose is at lunchtime, - with food or milk. - Okay, got it.<eos> If he doesn't want to take them, call me.<eos> - I'll come help.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And he'll probably just sleep today, but keep a close eye, okay?<eos> I will.
You work the diamonds.<eos> Figure out where they came from originally.<eos> Maybe we can figure whoever took them.<eos> Velcoro?<eos> He's on the Rulfo girl.<eos> What?<eos> I thought I killed you.<eos> Eleven years ago.<eos> Thereabouts.<eos> Maybe I still will.
That antique still works?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Murdoch?<eos> He's by the skidder.<eos> - Is he breathing?<eos> - No.<eos> Come on.<eos> Now, we'll... drag them both off into the woods.<eos> What if somebody finds them?<eos> Not up here, they won't.
That's weird.<eos> I thought I made more cupcakes.<eos> Where are all the other ones?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You ate them.<eos> What?<eos> I had one cupcake.<eos> Okay, three cupcakes.<eos> You better hope we have enough for Miguel's birthday.<eos> We will.
She's my girlfriend.<eos> She said you called her. No, no, no.<eos> See, I called her father.<eos> Well, she's come a long way to see you.<eos> That means something.<eos> - Hector?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, yeah. O-okay.<eos> - "Okay," you want to see her?<eos> - I'll...
Even the laddoos (sweet) are coming out.<eos> - Fight like a warrior!<eos> - Fight like Salman Khan!<eos> - My heap is bigger than yours.<eos> - Liar!<eos> Learn to fight from me!<eos> - More jalebis.<eos> - Thanks, Samsher.<eos> - Please talk to Pari about our wedding.<eos> - Yes I will.
Oh my God!<eos> Did your son approve of the dream?<eos> He asked me if that was where he was going.<eos> I told him it was.<eos> Some would say your son is in a better place.<eos> I happen to believe true paradise lies in his father's arms, to be here with you<eos> in this moment<eos> and that is not our choice.<eos> God has made his plans and we cannot question his design, just as my people cannot question mine,<eos> but they will.
Yo, Franky D.<eos> When we hitting the ladymarket in fishtown again? Really?<eos> You want to talk about picking up other girls in front of your girlfriend? W-what?<eos> No, man.<eos> I...<eos> He knows, Asher.<eos> You told him?<eos> No, she'd never, with all the crap she's given me for screwing students. But don't worry...<eos> I won't tell Annalise.<eos> Or maybe I will.
You know that we can't help him.<eos> The only way we could get back with the food was to tell her we could.<eos> - I get it.<eos> - I'm here.<eos> It's me.<eos> All right, it's...<eos> it's gonna be over soon.<eos> And these people are gonna help us. And we're all grateful, Ben.<eos> But somebody's gonna have to tell that girl.<eos> I will.
Instead, you sought the help of a demon.<eos> It's all such a waste.<eos> You found the force behind the rising darkness.<eos> We could've stopped it,<eos> - you and I together.<eos> - You think I wanted this?<eos> You know what I think?<eos> To save yourself from hell, you acted without considering the consequences.<eos> It's not that I can't help you, John.<eos> I won't.
I had to be convincing. - Those guy would have raped me...<eos> - Oh, fuck that acting shit!<eos> This boy's going home.<eos> Click those boots together, Joe Dirt, you know what to say.<eos> I just say, "There ain't no place like home"?<eos> Joe, I want to thank you for giving my wings.<eos> You got your wings?<eos> I did. Well, I'm going to get them now.<eos> - Am I supposed to hear a clang?<eos> - You will.
Thank you, Congresswoman.<eos> Let's move to part one: foreign policy.<eos> And the first question is for you, Mr. President.<eos> Given the recent volatile events in the Jordan Valley, do you still believe it was correct to assemble the United Nations coalition and to intervene, or is it time now to call that intervention a mistake?<eos> Well, I will answer that question, John, but I'd like to address first something Ms. Dunbar said a few moments ago.<eos> America Works is not some stale, old, conservative agenda.<eos> You name me one Republican who has suggested using federal funds to guarantee jobs for every American who wants one and I will eat my hat.<eos> This isn't about dismantling government.<eos> It is about-- Aren't we supposed to be talking about foreign policy?<eos> Yeah, I will.
I remember meeting you in 1987,<eos> 28 years ago, and you looked exactly the same as you do today.<eos> Don't understand?<eos> That's OK.<eos> I didn't either at first.<eos> Told myself here's a man who looks like someone I met a long time ago.<eos> And then I realized... he is that man.<eos> I didn't meet you in 1987.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But you will.
But why did you kill my friends?<eos> They had nothing to do with this!<eos> To watch you suffer, Emma.<eos> Although they did help a lot.<eos> After all, what did your BFFs do?<eos> They filmed your first time.<eos> I mean, the day that your video accidentally went viral and I was right there to see it happen?<eos> Priceless.<eos> They're gonna figure out who did this.<eos> No, they won't.
Her father?<eos> Husband?<eos> Her former employer.<eos> Oh, a procurer, in our house?<eos> - Emma, stop.<eos> - What does he want?<eos> Well, why don't I go find out and then I will send him on his way.<eos> Do you want to go with Adele? No.<eos> No, I want this madness to end.<eos> So it will.
There she is.<eos> For you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Nice place.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I can see why Simon wanted to take it from you.<eos> Your information checked out.<eos> With proof I can destroy him in this divorce.<eos> - You said you had documentation?<eos> - I will.
[ chuckles ] I found this on my terminal.<eos> Liz in your antique store just before she was hit.<eos> I saw this, and i thought, "huh.<eos> These guys ran into each other, and they didn't say anything?<eos> Why?"<eos> So i did what all good hackers do --<eos> I dug into your records, Which appear to be fake.<eos> [ beeping quickens ] [ grunting ] She's going into shock.<eos> Why aren't the alarms sounding?<eos> They won't.
You don't think he...<eos> I wouldn't put anything past Malcolm.<eos> That's why this has to end.<eos> I'm meeting him here tonight.<eos> What's your plan?<eos> I told him that I have his daughter.<eos> What?<eos> You mean alive?<eos> What happens when he finds out she's not?<eos> He won't.
Well, now it's time to say Goodbye<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Now, that was fun!<eos> Awkward.<eos> Marianne slammed him pretty good.<eos> Well, so much for being king.<eos> You think I can't be king?<eos> King Roland!<eos> Wouldn't he have to marry Marianne?<eos> Yes, and he will.
Visiting day is in two days.<eos> We would like to give you the opportunity to write a letter to the person that you would like to have come visit.<eos> Isn't that nice?<eos> In 30 minutes, you will be required to turn in a finished letter.<eos> Do not seal the envelope.<eos> Whether or not your letter gets sent will be based on your behavior.<eos> Are there any questions?<eos> I have a question, Mr. Chief Correctional Officer.<eos> Uh, will we be allowed one phone call?<eos> No, you will not.
She votes one way, he votes the opposite.<eos> Guilty.<eos> Good guess.<eos> Totally wrong.<eos> Do you see what he's doing?<eos> He's taking a drink after she does.<eos> That's called mirroring.<eos> It means that, whether he knows it or not, he has accepted her as the alpha.<eos> If she votes "not guilty,"<eos> he will, too.
By doing nothing, you're digging his grave.<eos> I'll hold on to this.<eos> Jade?<eos> Must be hard for you to see them like that.<eos> Your father's a baron.<eos> He's free to take as many wives as he wants.<eos> Don't pretend it doesn't hurt, Mother.<eos> I know it does.<eos> He needs me, Ryder.<eos> And he always will.
- Sylvie.<eos> - Boy, is it good to see you two.<eos> I'll let boden know we're here.<eos> - Listen, about the other night,<eos> I really did have to charge my phone.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> - I know.<eos> I mean, i believe you.<eos> - So can we talk?<eos> - We will.
Don't worry, Senator.<eos> Our friends will be along.<eos> Stay close, Senator.<eos> We've gotta get Trayvis out of here!<eos> Follow us.<eos> Was really hoping that shuttle'd still be here.<eos> And that's not the ride we're looking for.<eos> Agent Kallus, they must not escape!<eos> They haven't, Minister.<eos> They won't.
You're gonna need...<eos> - Data tapes?<eos> You were brave today, kid.<eos> You jumped right in there to help.<eos> A great Jedi once told me that the best leaders lead by example.<eos> You do that well.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I've learned from a great Jedi too. Kanan.<eos> Mmm. You know, I don't think he likes me.<eos> Or ever will.
I hear that a lot.<eos> A new way, a new approach to crime on our streets.<eos> But no matter what, whenever I vote for that person, we end up right where we started.<eos> We end up with... um, uh, the murder rate continually climbing.<eos> We end up...<eos> In short, inexperience is not a value. It is something to be...<eos> Mrs. Florrick, your time is up.<eos> Mr. Prady, in about ten minutes we'll have a verdict in the Cole Willis manslaughter case.<eos> Do you have a comment on that trial?<eos> Well, Chris, uh, I will in about ten minutes.
No problem.<eos> Yeah, it's okay, buddy.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> -Carol!<eos> How many times have I told you this is my private time? !<eos> Your private time is poisoning the neighborhood, okay?<eos> This is Stink City, Phil.<eos> You know what, Carol, just...<eos> Do I go into your house and tell you what to do with your little lady turds?<eos> No, and you never will.
Guys, let's not talk about business.<eos> - Sylvia, let him finish.<eos> What are you doing now, Robert?<eos> - Now?<eos> I'm here to increase my opportunities.<eos> - Increase even further?<eos> Is everything OK over there?<eos> - I'll get it.<eos> No, I'll get it.<eos> - No, I will.
Why don't we get some backup.<eos> Eph is right.<eos> We should go tell Justine.<eos> She's got cops, guns.<eos> She needs to know that strigoi got into Red Hook.<eos> No, we should stay here.<eos> Eichorst will come for me.<eos> I know it.<eos> We have a chance to finish him.<eos> And we will.
The beta test was nearly flawless.<eos> Soon, VAL will shape the emotions of millions of users, and Fetch Retrieve will be one of the most powerful advertising and content delivery platforms in the world.<eos> And if a few people commit suicide along the way, tough luck.<eos> I feel awful about what happened to Paul Zimmerman.<eos> But he was the unfortunate consequence of a successful test.<eos> And I'm not gonna let you or Anna Mueller or anyone else destroy what I've worked so hard to build.<eos> Calvin, you can't just kill innocent people.<eos> You'd be amazed what a private security corporation will do for the right price.<eos> Luckily, I can pay.<eos> You will.
We're selling coke now?<eos> We're not selling coke.<eos> The whores are selling the coke.<eos> Did you kill that pimp?<eos> Technically, the water killed the pimp.<eos> I got to do it again!<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's going on?<eos> They won't give me a second chance.<eos> Oh, the hell they won't.
" Me?"<eos> I must see this plate, Brother.<eos> As is with the Angel Moroni, the plate is for mine eyes, and mine alone to see.<eos> Your acceptance of his message, Brother, is the test that will prove you worthy of this new, exalted role.<eos> Now, I...<eos> I must show you something.<eos> Guns?<eos> For what purpose, Brother?<eos> Some in Salt Lake City will accept this revelation.<eos> Some... will not.
Dost thou understand my English tongue?<eos> Answer me.<eos> What dost thou want?<eos> What canst thou give?<eos> Wouldst thou like the taste of butter?<eos> A pretty dress?<eos> Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?<eos> Yes.<eos> Wouldst thou like to see the world?<eos> What will you from me?
You can go home, too.<eos> No, it's too much.<eos> It's too late.<eos> I've been here too long.<eos> No, this is my home now.<eos> I still have some work to do.<eos> Ok.<eos> If you manage to make it back to 2077, give this to my father.<eos> There are some things I needed to say to him, to you, that I never had the chance to before I left.<eos> I will.
How about you?<eos> How's the world outside?<eos> Still spinning.<eos> Tell me about those riots in philadelphia.<eos> That was an unfortunate incident.<eos> And those fires in tokyo.<eos> The world's not perfect.<eos> It never was.<eos> Tolerance is not gonna come overnight.<eos> No, it will not.
It's all a part of the process.<eos> But for now, your chest only, okay?<eos> It feels so good.<eos> Could you maybe...<eos> Not on the first visit.<eos> It's been so long since anyone's touched me like that.<eos> I know, but--<eos> What if this is the only erection I ever get?<eos> I may not have another chance.<eos> You will.
- Go... now.<eos> I don't want to see either one of you.<eos> Just hear us out... please.<eos> We realized we've been so concerned about earning Emma's forgiveness that... We forgot the person we hurt most.<eos> So you're here to apologize.<eos> I'm afraid I'm not the one whose forgiveness you really need.<eos> Your daughter.<eos> She was an innocent.<eos> It's her you need to apologize to.<eos> We will.
They will be yours to command.<eos> This pleases the gods.<eos> You will be well rewarded.<eos> But this cannot be done alone.<eos> Others have reason to see the Pharaoh removed from power, others who can be used to our advantage.<eos> You speak of General Horemheb.<eos> His ambitions are not consistent with my own.<eos> Once it is done, he too can be removed.<eos> You have the general's ear?<eos> I will.
We tried everything we could to save him.<eos> This is not your fault.<eos> No.<eos> It's yours.<eos> You... are the source of my sorrow, Ichabod Crane.<eos> You are the reason I was not there to raise my son.<eos> I never should have saved your life when the Horseman cut you down.<eos> I never should have put you to sleep.<eos> I should've let you die!<eos> And this time, I will.
When I was his age, I was sleeping on the street, and trying to stretch $11 to last me a week.<eos> So, what, simply because your life was hard, his has to be, too?<eos> No, but life doesn't get easier by avoiding things.<eos> I guess you didn't learn that up on the horsey estate.<eos> You wanna drag the kid back?<eos> Fine. Then what?<eos> Are you gonna be there for him in the fallout?<eos> Or is it only Hanna you care about?<eos> The kid is ready to put on his big-boy pants, and offer up a little insight.<eos> Otherwise, I will.
Uh, your radiation treatment.<eos> Radiation hasn't worked yet.<eos> I don't see why it's suddenly supposed to start working. - Radiation is bull...<eos> - Shepherd says that it's necessary.<eos> She's the doctor here.<eos> "Life will out."<eos> The origins and lessons of life and evolution are long and complex, but what they basically boil down to is, life will out.<eos> Life will always find a way to continue.<eos> Always.<eos> Life... will... out.
Yeah, it's too dry.<eos> If I can rehydrate it, maybe Angela can reconstruct the image.<eos> Given the state of the skull, that may be our best chance at identifying the victim.<eos> Well, we have footprints-- two sets.<eos> Right, so he was chased down the hill, and he hid in the mine.<eos> Which was packed with explosives.<eos> Eh, bad for him.<eos> Well, there was a "danger" sign.<eos> Guy's not gonna stop to read the sign if he's being chased by someone.<eos> Well, maybe next time he will.
Well, there is a problem.<eos> See, Connor Freeman is dead. True.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, it's hard for me to accept that, I guess.<eos> The victim was cut.<eos> Do you mind if I check your knives for blood?<eos> These men are gonna think that you suspect them.<eos> Well, at this point, I suspect everyone. Even you.<eos> All right, look, a lot of these guys are gonna make it because of the work that you've done, all right?<eos> And some of them won't.
I must be easy to read.<eos> You are.<eos> Is that bad?<eos> Makes a change.<eos> The people I work with... are inscrutable.<eos> I can be inscrutable.<eos> Did you look through my clothes?<eos> See you.<eos> Has he rung?<eos> He will.
A queen but not a queen.<eos> A wife but not a wife.<eos> Then be my wife.<eos> I can't.<eos> We've been over this already.<eos> Too much has passed between us.<eos> Too much you blame me for.<eos> While condA© remains untarnished.<eos> And now you want to go to him, Thinking it will erase your pain.<eos> It won't, mary.
He looks like a little boy.<eos> We... we try not to call names here.<eos> Don't look at him! - Good first day, Bishop. - You never look at a man when he cries.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - You ever let your friends try on your uniform? - What? No.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Me either.<eos> Don't do it.<eos> I'm serious. - Don't do that.<eos> - I won't. I won't.
Everybody wants a second chance, right?<eos> Sure you're gonna be alright?<eos> Like I told you, I always am.<eos> Can we at least give you a ride somewhere?<eos> Give me the keys.<eos> All right, here you go.<eos> It's all the cash we got.<eos> Thanks for everything.<eos> You stay safe out there, you hear?<eos> I will.
Will you be all right?<eos> What was that for?<eos> Fun.<eos> That's enough of that.<eos> We've been seen.<eos> Who was that woman?<eos> She saw us together.<eos> She could tell anyone...<eos> it would mean our heads.<eos> She won't.
Get what?<eos> The video, obviously.<eos> I thought he was better.<eos> He is... but you never know about tomorrow.<eos> I'd like to keep it handy, just in case.<eos> I'll let you know once I make a copy.<eos> Don't call this number.<eos> Call my cell.<eos> Please don't forget.<eos> I won't.
Well, do you think you could describe the face you saw to one of our artists?<eos> Sure.<eos> I want to do that.<eos> Mini golf lost a legend.<eos> And I lost...<eos> Man, some of these pieces are bent.<eos> Or rusted.<eos> They don't fit together;<eos> the escapement wheel doesn't seem to fit right.<eos> It will.
A secret message written in Braille between you and your son, discussing my escape.<eos> Finally, the knockout gas used to disable the orderlies.<eos> 'Cause, you see, Dad, this guy I was telling you about, he's the one who broke me out of Arkham.<eos> He doesn't want anyone to know about that. Obviously.<eos> So... the police will find these letters, and they'll think,<eos> "The blind old fool really loved his son.<eos> What a wonderful father." Oh.<eos> There won't be a dry eye in the house.<eos> They'll never believe it.<eos> Ah, sure, they will.
Well, she's been bullied and taken for granted for too long.<eos> - And I want her to understand... - You saved her life!<eos> For God's sake!<eos> She owes you.<eos> Take what you deserve.<eos> Miss Kringle. Dinner, tonight.<eos> Chez Moi. 8:00.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> You will.
Wait, wait, hold on!<eos> Behind you!<eos> Officer?<eos> Hola.<eos> Detective Gordon, I presume?<eos> - Who is this?<eos> - This is Eduardo Flamingo.<eos> Is that name supposed to mean something to me?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But it will.
- Who is this?<eos> - This is Eduardo Flamingo.<eos> Is that name supposed to mean something to me?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But it will.<eos> I'll be upstairs in a few minutes.<eos> I'm going to feast on your friends first.<eos> Save you for dessert.<eos> You try to run, I will find you.<eos> I won't.
What then?<eos> Silver, get him to tell you the name, and I will make sure he has the best defense money can buy, I promise.<eos> You think he's guilty.<eos> Why would you believe anything he says?<eos> Because it would come from you.<eos> If you bring me the name, I'll know it's real.<eos> Do you mean that?<eos> I'll call you after I talk to him.<eos> Still got to get the name.<eos> I will.
I know... you want to hurt me, just a little.<eos> I've been a very bad girl.<eos> No.<eos> You're a good woman.<eos> You're just sick, is all.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I knew you still had feelings for me.<eos> Of course I have feelings.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> I will.
Get the suspect's photo out to every unit, stat.<eos> She's armed and dangerous.<eos> - Does Cat know? - No.<eos> I dropped her and Heather off at the apartment like we planned.<eos> She knows I'm staying at J.T.'s, - so she's got no idea.<eos> - It won't be easy to keep this from her.<eos> - Frankly I'm not even sure we should.<eos> - If we tell her Julianna escaped, - she'll call off the wedding.<eos> - Tess is right.<eos> She will.
Reason number five.<eos> Uh, this just in... you're not rich and Chanel is loaded.<eos> So, huh, doi, Neckbrace, that's who I'm bringing home to meet my parents.<eos> Well...<eos> I guess we'll just have to see how it goes bringing Chanel home for Thanksgiving.<eos> Yeah, I guess we will see, as that's what's going to happen.<eos> I guess we'll just have to wait and see.<eos> Yeah, we will wait and see, as Thanksgiving is an event that takes place in the future and therefore it hasn't happened yet.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yep, sure will.
He is?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> And we had a lot to discuss.<eos> Like what?<eos> What happens in the diner stays in the diner.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> The whole point of the dinner was we would have more to talk about.<eos> And we will, just not about last night.<eos> Well, it sounds like you guys have a lot to talk about on the ride home, so good luck with that.<eos> Yes, we will.
One more year.<eos> - One more year and I'm gone.<eos> - What about me?<eos> Well, Berkeley's got a good arts program.<eos> Name me one artist I like from Berkeley.<eos> Exactly.<eos> We're only a few hours away.<eos> Same state, same time zone.<eos> Won't have to miss me that much.<eos> But I will.
Oh... Because I really care about you, Walter.<eos> Because I really care about you, Walter.<eos> You hacked the hospital security footage?<eos> Because I really care about you, Walter.<eos> Bet that satellite can't get here fast enough for you, huh, pal?<eos> Okay.<eos> It was, uh, simple curiosity and, uh, gathering of the facts.<eos> Okay.<eos> If we're done with the film festival, do we have a plan "B"?<eos> Yeah, we will.
Your urine is in there. Why would you keep my pee?<eos> I need belongings, Jake, to feel like a man.<eos> Look, this is a bad idea, Hoytsman.<eos> People are gonna notice if I disappear.<eos> See? Someone's already looking for me.<eos> You're in big trouble, buddy.<eos> Your e-coupon for Big Mike's Calzones expires today.<eos> You're damn right. And if I don't redeem that, Big Mike is gonna get real suspicious.<eos> Big Mike is a cartoon with pizzas for eyes.<eos> All right, fine. Maybe not Big Mike, but someone will.
Dad, what the hell?<eos> You have your passport?<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> But, Richard, Europe?<eos> No "buts." I need to know that you're safe.<eos> Now, the... the police are gonna take you to the airport.<eos> I have friends waiting for you on the other side.<eos> Okay.<eos> Dad, please be safe.<eos> I will.
I said yes because I wanted to go.<eos> But speaking of places we've gone lately:<eos> - Did you visit Mom's grave?<eos> - I've been working.<eos> The King's welfare is never ending.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - If you've got something to say, say it.<eos> You know what?<eos> Fine.<eos> I will.
Hey, I try not to look at her like that.<eos> That must be difficult.<eos> It is.<eos> She haunts my dreams... just kidding.<eos> She does though.<eos> Well, I should say my goodbyes.<eos> Nice day, huh?<eos> I just wanted to say I'm sorry I have to leave you so soon.<eos> I don't even know you.<eos> And now, you never will.
No matter how much you think you have, there's always room to grow.<eos> You made Prospero think the tree was destroyed so...<eos> So that he'd give up.<eos> Defeated a Fictional with fiction.<eos> Good plan, Librarian.<eos> Just don't remember what that tree was.<eos> I think it was important.<eos> Yeah, it looks important.<eos> Let's not tell Jenkins.<eos> We won't.
Sinan's not the only fish in the sea.<eos> Gran, you told me a month ago that he was my last chance.<eos> What last chance?<eos> Everyone should be nice to my little peanut.<eos> Well, all your "wisdom" has made me a total idiot.<eos> I know what'll do you good.<eos> This is so good for me.<eos> I could slit my wrists any second.<eos> - Will you have raki?<eos> - She will.
Agent Richards.<eos> Agent Richards. Look, the DoD wants our agencies to work together on this, okay?<eos> You had to have heard something.<eos> Why did the DEA select Fahad to be in the training program?<eos> Honestly, don't know.<eos> What's that for?<eos> That's for my boss, Henrietta Lange.<eos> You've probably heard of her.<eos> No?<eos> Oh, well, you soon will.
Okay, we're gonna need a crow bar or something to lift this thing.<eos> You look back there, and I'll check these shelves.<eos> Anything up there?<eos> Not a thing, buddy.<eos> I feel like I saw some sort of a...<eos> Are they aware...?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> Maybe we can use this broom handle to pry it loose.<eos> No, that won't work.<eos> Yes, it will.
Thank you.<eos> You tracked him for a long time.<eos> Well, it's why I became a police officer.<eos> To find him.<eos> He was my, ah... last and best lead.<eos> All the other evidence had closed?<eos> My sister was abducted when I was 12 years old, Inspector.<eos> The trail has gone very, very cold.<eos> You never stopped looking for her.<eos> I never will.
- Because it turns out they weren't.<eos> They weren't false.<eos> He knew things about me.<eos> Things I didn't even know.<eos> About my husband at the time.<eos> Whatever connection he thought we had whatever history he was implying we shared, I didn't care.<eos> You've discovered something curious about your husband...<eos> - He wanted me for a reason and I wanted to know why.<eos> He has diplomatic immunity. If anyone finds out--<eos> They won't.
You intentionally accessed classified intelligence without authority.<eos> I should have you arrested right here and now.<eos> Smiling Tommy Connolly.<eos> You always were a smug bastard.<eos> And you were always a paranoid, self-righteous prick.<eos> Your Honor.<eos> Here's what we do.<eos> You're gonna quash this subpoena.<eos> - And if I don't?<eos> - You will.
- Then no.<eos> We should just take the kids back to the school.<eos> No, we can't. I can't reach the bus driver, and he's not due back till 3:00.<eos> - Is there someplace that we can...<eos> - Dr. Webber, you coming?<eos> Yeah, I'll be right there.<eos> Um, kids, let's go see the babies.<eos> - It's nice and peaceful up there. - Excuse me.<eos> Dr. Edwards will take you.<eos> - I will?
Ernie!<eos> Please apologize to Frondi.<eos> The flautist. Uh...<eos> The flute player. Oh.<eos> Sorry, Frondi.<eos> I should go.<eos> We'll take care of the charges and the damages.<eos> - We'll spare no expense. - No, we will not.<eos> No, we will not. - We will spare no expense.<eos> - No, we will not.
I don't have enough.<eos> Yet.<eos> I grab her now, she'll lawyer up, and then she'll walk.<eos> You should order something.<eos> Oh, you kidding?<eos> I'm vegan.<eos> Hey, a girl's allowed to be complex, isn't she?<eos> You should eat, though.<eos> You heard from Baitfish?<eos> I will.
Sure, me too.<eos> Great!<eos> We're all animals.<eos> What happened with our sanctuary project?<eos> The ministry's given the OK.<eos> But if they give the OK, they don't give funds.<eos> - So?<eos> - So we have to find a sponsor.<eos> - Who'd give money like that nowadays?<eos> - Somone will!
Stay here.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> What are you doing with him?<eos> Just listen to what he has to say.<eos> I'll be all right.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Your dad's.<eos> I thought I told you not to go over there anymore.<eos> I won't.
3-year-old Larry Merrin would have said the monster dragged him down the stairs.<eos> And 4-year-old Daniel Karras one-upped it by adding a sexual detail.<eos> That's how kids tell stories, especially when they're reinforced by well-meaning parents, therapists, and cops.<eos> And in doing so, they ruin the unsub's life, and now he's taking revenge.<eos> Ok, so if this is the why, how do we find him?<eos> We talk to Christine McNeil.<eos> Maybe she can tell us where the foster home was.<eos> Flag on the play there.<eos> She's not talking to anyone.<eos> Maybe she will.
It's after 10:00.<eos> What?<eos> No. Can't be.<eos> Whoa! It's past 10:00.<eos> We've been here for two hours.<eos> That explains the nasty looks we received from people who wanted our table.<eos> Yeah. Can't eat pie fast, or you'll cramp.<eos> That is a science.<eos> Some day I would love to live in a world governed by your rules of physics.<eos> You will.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> "They know, and it'll all be over soon."<eos> That's what you said upstairs on the phone.<eos> So who were you talking to?<eos> Why should I answer when I can see you won't believe me?<eos> Through here.<eos> Anything like this ever happen on a flight before?<eos> Closest I came was a 90-year-old who had a heart attack.<eos> Luckily, that one had a happy ending.<eos> - This one will, too.
- No.<eos> I mean, you're free.<eos> Bates is free, the threat's gone away.<eos> I'd expect you to be wreathed in smiles but, instead, you seem rather cast down.<eos> Life's never simple is it, m'lady?<eos> You don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.<eos> It's almost funny, really, given the service I once performed for you.<eos> You know, Mr Bates and I have always wanted children?<eos> And you'll have some now, I'm sure.<eos> No, I won't.
Don't take me there, please!<eos> The fire, this town...<eos> I find it all hard to believe.<eos> And you've witnessed it, Michael.<eos> Our faith in God is the reason for everything.<eos> Our Father is here.<eos> Faith is useless in this world.<eos> That's not our truth.<eos> It's clear you don't believe in our faith.<eos> Perhaps you never will.
Movement!<eos> Get down on the ground! Wait, wait, wait.<eos> That's Zoe. Go, go, go!<eos> Move it out!<eos> Damn it, he had her. Left side!<eos> Left side!<eos> Michael, when you came to us, you were a stranger.<eos> Now you belong to us.<eos> Will you take the secrets and sins of our town into your heart?<eos> Yes, I will.
Well, this is it.<eos> He's pleading innocence but our records show while he's never been convicted, he's been close to several crimes in the past. Always carried out by women, and he's escaped prosecution every time.<eos> We know he worked in the same house as you, and that he left on the day that you stole the jewels from your mistress.<eos> - And those jewels were never found, and you've kept silent.<eos> We want you to testify to that effect as a character witness.<eos> We're only trying to protect vulnerable young women from him in the future.<eos> He's ruined several lives.<eos> I'll leave you now, Miss Baxter.<eos> Please consider my request.<eos> Of course she will, Sergeant Willis.
Charles chipped all of us.<eos> That's why it hurts when you press on it.<eos> And you think the person who did this to us the person who's after us is Charles?<eos> The dead Charles?<eos> He never was and I knew it.<eos> He tried to make us believe he was dead because he had to.<eos> I mean, the only reason he gave his name up was because he thought we'd never get out of that hellhole.<eos> Okay, so what was Lesli?<eos> A speed bump. On the way to finding Charles.<eos> But we will.
And then the craziest girl showed up.<eos> 'She was awesome.'<eos> I'd sneak into her room every night for story time.<eos> She was so drugged up that in the beginning she thought I was you.<eos> I did everything you asked me to.<eos> - I'm proud of you.<eos> - You are?<eos> You're getting better.<eos> Just keep taking your meds.<eos> I will, Ali.
It's a constant pattern.<eos> Are you making yourself comfortable?<eos> - Getting you out of here. - Whoa.<eos> Stand back.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Mona?<eos> I have to know how the story ends.<eos> Hanna, be careful.<eos> We will.
I can't go to Jupiter!<eos> Who am I kidding? I can't even--<eos> What are you saying, Fritz?<eos> What I'm saying is just--<eos> Is that a decoder ring?<eos> I know that I'm no war hero or even brave, and I have sciatica, and--<eos> I do!<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I mean, um--<eos> - I will.
Could you give me a second?<eos> What is she doing here?<eos> Is she here to confront me?<eos> No, I've just seen, she's on my list.<eos> It's a normal appointment. She booked it a couple of days ago.<eos> Come here.<eos> This is hard.<eos> I'm good at keeping my head together, but today...<eos> - Talk to Simon.<eos> - I will.
- Well, you should. - But your face.<eos> Look, if you take a seat, when he's off the phone,<eos> - I'll let him know that you're here.<eos> - I wanted his support.<eos> I've basically just lost my job, but from the expression on your face,<eos> I think he's off having sex with Kate Parks again.<eos> You split with your husband. So, you can imagine something of what I'm feeling.<eos> I've known for a while.<eos> They have no idea.<eos> Well, they will now.
Is invested in Academy Green.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Neil said. - He wouldn't. - Just after we slept together.<eos> He was all right, actually.<eos> I wouldn't sell tickets but we had a good time.<eos> You wanted to get back at me.<eos> Is it sinking in?<eos> Have you felt it yet?<eos> No.<eos> But you will.
I shot a man.<eos> An FBI agent.<eos> - I can't just walk away from that.<eos> - No, a man claiming to be an FBI agent tried to kill you and you defended yourself.<eos> Quite capably, as Jackson says.<eos> - But we can't prove that.<eos> - So let's do something about it.<eos> Let's prove that not-really-FBI-Agent Ben Shafer was working for Reiden.<eos> - Instead of...<eos> - We will.
- An FBI agent!<eos> - A dirty FBI agent. At best.<eos> So you've just said.<eos> Who?<eos> - Who killed him?<eos> - I can't tell you.<eos> A member of my team.<eos> The good news is... I've been tracking channels, and there hasn't been any chatter. None.<eos> It's almost as if they haven't discovered his body yet.<eos> But they will.
That's the new voice.<eos> So I obey it all the way home.<eos> Took me three hours round the North Circular,<eos> I only live ten minutes away.<eos> My girlfriend asked why I was late.<eos> I said I'd dropped off for a drink at the pub.<eos> I couldn't tell her.<eos> "He's been a real shit today."<eos> "He's talking through the sat nav now."<eos> But I will.
Well, I had no choice.<eos> A potential client had a last minute layover at JFK.<eos> But I did personally congratulate Mr. Hui.<eos> Who is this potential client?<eos> A Mr. Silva from Brazil.<eos> That's all I got.<eos> I apologize.<eos> I should have let someone know.<eos> Don't let this happen again.<eos> It won't.
You know of River Song, wife of Hydroflax?<eos> I do.<eos> I know River Song of old.<eos> And if you spare me, I'll tell you who she's really married to.<eos> - Explain.<eos> - You need a head.<eos> I can get you a head... fit for a king.<eos> Why do you delay?<eos> We have paid, we will receive.<eos> Yes, you will.
I do.<eos> I know River Song of old.<eos> And if you spare me, I'll tell you who she's really married to.<eos> - Explain.<eos> - You need a head.<eos> I can get you a head... fit for a king.<eos> Why do you delay?<eos> We have paid, we will receive.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> Of... by jingo, you will, yes, of course.
You won't last a day in the wind.<eos> Triangulate the signal and find her.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna find the needle.<eos> Remember, NATs, you have two hours to find evidence in your rooms of potential terrorist threat.<eos> You can talk to me outside of class, you know. This isn't high school.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> Have you found anything on my father yet? I mean, was he even in the FBI?<eos> I told you I'd let you know if I found something.<eos> And I will.
They have no idea you were there.<eos> I can't believe I trusted you.<eos> Okay, look, if my... if my allegiance was to the FBI, you and Alex would both be in handcuffs right now.<eos> I did what I could do.<eos> It is my ass on the line, too, you know.<eos> So, what the hell do we do now?<eos> Up.<eos> You're gonna tell me how this wire from your family business ended up as a part of those bombs.<eos> I don't have to tell you anything.<eos> Oh, you will, eventually.
But if we turn on one of our own, we'll never be able to live with each other. Or with ourselves.<eos> 10 from her is better than 3 from us.<eos> Where's Simon?<eos> Come in.<eos> May I help you?<eos> There's been a turn upstairs.<eos> We decided not to cooperate with your exercise.<eos> That's unfortunate.<eos> I'll have to cut 10.<eos> No, you won't.
Um, if you're looking for Caleb, he went to say goodbye to the analysts who got the ax.<eos> He passed?<eos> Miranda's test and yours.<eos> You didn't really want him to take the bribe, did you?<eos> Miss Wyatt, my son is a screw-up.<eos> I want him to find his place in the world.<eos> I just don't believe for a second it's here.<eos> And if you're honest with yourself, you'd agree.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You will.
Keep speaking it.<eos> Little Lammy.<eos> Please. Little Lammy.<eos> Who goes there?<eos> No!<eos> Calo, no!<eos> He got up to piss.<eos> I didn't hear a thing.<eos> The yard boss doesn't remember killing Calo.<eos> And he never will.
Do I get a hug?<eos> Do you think Santa will come this year?<eos> Have you been good?<eos> MISSION 2<eos> Has grandfather told you about how Grandma came by herself once?<eos> We won't do that now.<eos> I think she was very embarrassed.<eos> If it happens today so you will have to whisper.<eos> Do it then...<eos> -Now they will.
Are you going to have leftovers?<eos> Robin?<eos> Shut up, I'm sleeping!<eos> Don't stop.<eos> Stina, that night Lisa got married at the hotel... After I had tucked you in...<eos> What does it mean when you put a bird on a tombstone?<eos> The desire to give the dead peace.<eos> I want a bird on mine.<eos> But you won't die.<eos> -Someday I will.
- Marcus is precise. He won't "chat".<eos> Unless you're talking about mathematics, the discussion will be a waste of time.<eos> Is it possible that Alex would have confided in him?<eos> - That's a very serious allegation.<eos> - I'm just thinking aloud.<eos> Marcus admired Alex.<eos> On some level, he might have envied him, but... .. I can't believe he'd want to harm him.<eos> Could you arrange a meeting?<eos> So you do have something specific you're going to speak to him about?<eos> - We will.
I'm in a meeting.<eos> Will you excuse me?<eos> You want to get that message out there, too?<eos> What message?<eos> That your foundation does deals with Hezbollah?<eos> A conversation is not a deal, Colonel.<eos> And Mr. During needs to be able to move freely around the camp.<eos> As you wish.<eos> Listen, if things get gnarly...<eos> It won't.
Amira, something's come up, which is why I'd prefer to not do this through normal channels.<eos> And-and I'd rather not talk about this over the phone.<eos> Are you all right, dear?<eos> Tell me.<eos> I will, if you have time to see me.<eos> I can... come to your hotel later this morning.<eos> That'd be great. Thank you.<eos> I'm looking forward to seeing you.<eos> We have to stop meeting like this.<eos> We will, actually.
The fund itself has already made five times that amount.<eos> I'd like to ask you to leave.<eos> Shall I pass your name along, then?<eos> I'm not working there.<eos> They killed my mother.<eos> And every fast food joint around the corner delivers diabetes to millions of people.<eos> Phillip Morris hands out lung cancer on the hour, every hour.<eos> I mean, hell, everyone's destroying the planet beyond the point of no return.<eos> Are you really gonna start taking all of these things so personally?<eos> Maybe I will.
Court is in session.<eos> The honorable judge Escorpion presiding.<eos> These fools stand accused of grand larceny, willful deception and fraud.<eos> In case you were wondering, I almost broke 80 today.<eos> Not only did you steal from Mr. Burr, you stole from the Zeros.<eos> And you robbed me of the greatest golf game of my life.<eos> How do you feel about that?<eos> It's disappointing.<eos> Will you be acting as your own counsel?<eos> I will, your honor.
"Hey, look at me.<eos> I'm Mr. So-And-So-Dick.<eos> I've got such-and-such for a penis."<eos> I never saw it fail to get a laugh.<eos> All right! That's enough! You guys are talking about my species.<eos> We understand genocide.<eos> We do it sometimes.<eos> Then you would give your penis so that Shrimply Pibbles might live?<eos> - Stop asking!<eos> - Yes, I will!
Louis, we've already been over this.<eos> His lawyer's his wife. You're never gonna sign him.<eos> Well, that's just it.<eos> I don't need to sign him.<eos> I only need to pretend to sign him.<eos> Okay. That's a bad idea.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> If Jack thinks I signed Dellmore, And I tell him I'll give him a piece, He'll know it's worth a fortune to him<eos> And he'll overturn the vote. And what are you gonna do when he finds out The whole thing was a lie?<eos> He won't.
Yeah?<eos> Have you seen Jonas, by any chance?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> I was... just wondering if he'd asked about me or... wanted to know where I was.<eos> Should I tell him about your situation?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> I'll just get Numan, then, hmm?<eos> And you-- you be careful.<eos> I will.
I am?<eos> Some fucking clown-- and I sure hope it wasn't you, Dar-- just tore apart 12 years of painstaking work.<eos> Well, I agree with you there.<eos> So... you want to start by sharing some names with me.<eos> Names?<eos> Every one of Ivan Krupin's active agents here in Europe and Britain.<eos> Ask him yourself.<eos> He's in the next room, isn't he?<eos> I hardly think he'll talk to me.<eos> Of course he will.
_ _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You seem anxious.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> You're talking as if the attack is certain.<eos> These governments might give in.<eos> But they won't.
She believed him of course, and she healed me with her blood.<eos> Julian knew I could never tell Lily what he had done because that would also have exposed my lies.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She never would have forgiven me for having an affair with her son.<eos> I didn't want to live under Julian's thumb, so that night as we crossed the Atlantic, I drew myself a bath, laced my tea with laudanum, and went quietly to sleep...<eos> But I died with Lily's blood in my system...<eos> And by virtue of pure happenstance, I became the first heretic.<eos> You don't know how sorry I am...<eos> About everything.<eos> Maybe you never will.
No, there is one place, south of here.<eos> It's Wessex.<eos> They'll take one look at you and kill you as a Dane.<eos> Whereas Ubba will kill me as an Englishman.<eos> With King Aethelred, we have a chance of everything.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Why do they stare?<eos> They think you're pretty.<eos> Or they've never seen a Dane so close.<eos> But they will.
I will make a plea to Alfred.<eos> She's here, praise God.<eos> You should stand and look respectful, if not entirely clean.<eos> - How does she look?<eos> - Terrified, I bet.<eos> If you could be brief with the ceremony, Father Beocca,<eos> I'd be grateful.<eos> I have business with the king.<eos> The bride has been given her price?<eos> She Will.
Thank you, my friend. (GRUNTS)<eos> It is also clear that he is too proud and too stupid to repent, and as a consequence will die.<eos> He will die for leading men to treachery.<eos> (LEOFRIC) Because of my own guilt and because of my respect for Uhtred as a warrior, I request that he dies at my sword.<eos> You wish to become executioner, Leofric?<eos> My plea is for a fight to the death, lord.<eos> Me against the arseling.<eos> If God is with me, I will be the victor, and the ealdorman is allowed to die as a warrior should.<eos> And if he wins this fight to the death, what then?<eos> He will not.
What did she say?<eos> Oh, the usual.<eos> She should be regent, I'm sucking France dry.<eos> Prettiest vampire I've ever seen.<eos> There are so many things I wish we'd done together:<eos> eating oranges freshly plucked from the trees in Nice, dancing under the stars at the Louvre.<eos> Well, we were married there.<eos> Ah. So many ceremonies, so many nobles, and we barely got to dance.<eos> We will do all those things.<eos> We will.
- And some kind of tube.<eos> - A tube?<eos> Your Majesty, you received my invitation.<eos> What was so urgent?<eos> I've learned of your negotiations with the Valois.<eos> So disappointing after the wrongs they've done to your noble family.<eos> You have a counteroffer?<eos> Don't sign away your claim to the French throne and England will make it worth your while with gold and military support.<eos> And if France retaliates against my country?<eos> They won't.
And tell her what?<eos> That you see her future-murder in a vision?<eos> Does it matter what we tell her if we save her life?<eos> Look, even if we do manage to scare her off without completely outing your identity, what happens next? Well, she lives, for one thing.<eos> And Tyson walks to kill again, when we won't be there.<eos> The only way to take him off the streets for good is to catch him red-handed. With his victim.<eos> By using her as bait.<eos> And what if you mess up?<eos> - What if you can't stop it?<eos> - I will.
Robert, you accuse of me of such terrible things.<eos> - Why would I ever...?<eos> - Because you know.<eos> Admit it, Amy.<eos> I don't know anything, truly I don't.<eos> I love her.<eos> Don't.<eos> Please.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.
Where are you going?<eos> I'm going to Gaziantep.<eos> - You're a lucky guy.<eos> - Why?<eos> This deal with bootleg phones. I've wanted to get to Antep for weeks.<eos> So fate's decided: it's you and me.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> No! - Let me come.<eos> - No. I don't know you.<eos> - You soon will.
No, I'm just, uh...<eos> I'm just keeping the peace here. You know.<eos> Protecting and serving and...<eos> I want it on the record that I asked him to take me to the Beverly Wilshire.<eos> Three weeks into the affair, and this is what he calls romance.<eos> Wow, three weeks, Andrew?<eos> Not too classy. Beverly Wilshire would've been nice.<eos> Obviously, you guys have a lot to discuss so I will, uh, let you carry on.<eos> You tell him what's up.<eos> I will.
Do not compel me to lay hands on you, Governor.<eos> I have too much respect for you.<eos> Now you call this respect? Get out of the way.<eos> Release him.<eos> Unhand him, Standish.<eos> Hopkins, I thought you were with us!<eos> And Bradford thought you were with him!<eos> You do as your governor says.<eos> If you will not give up Squanto...<eos> I will not.
Okay, now that we've got control of the train, we can decouple the cars.<eos> The front car will crash, but the rear cars will slow to a stop.<eos> Okay, that's part of a two-step process.<eos> Now, you guys get onto the next car.<eos> Ralph, there's an operating panel near the door.<eos> There's a decoupling lever-- you flip it, it sends a signal.<eos> I accept the signal and then I have ten seconds to get onto your side before both cars separate.<eos> Okay, we have more than enough time, but you have to hurry.<eos> Okay, be careful.<eos> I will.
What kind?<eos> - What kind? - What kind?<eos> - Who cares?<eos> - Who cares?<eos> Strawberry.<eos> Oh, hang on, I'm getting another call.<eos> What's going on, Baxter?<eos> Quick Santa-related question.<eos> Candace and I were talking about getting Roscoe the new Xbox, but we won't if you think it might make you look bad.<eos> Well, actually, it will.
Hey, are we ready?<eos> Uh, which approach are you going to use?<eos> Jade's fall caused her spinal fracture to become severely unstable, so Pierce and I will have to repair it at the same time.<eos> It's not ideal, but... we sit Jade up for a craniotomy, it would paralyze her forever.<eos> So we'll be doing this surgery endonasally.<eos> Which is the wrong approach.<eos> We're out of options.<eos> Warren, go scrub.<eos> Someone needs to sign off on the case.<eos> All right, I will.
What does it mean?<eos> What do you think it means?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, then... Maybe... We should...<eos> Okay.<eos> Jade.<eos> Jade, can you hear me?<eos> Now can I get out of here?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Oh, you will soon enough.
I did, she won't help.<eos> If that girl has information about Daylight on her body, then we are in very serious trouble.<eos> It was a dream.<eos> A sex dream.<eos> So, who do you think he was, this dream man?<eos> That guy had a tattoo of a tree on his arm, and Weller doesn't have that.<eos> _<eos> Okay.<eos> If the wrong people find it...<eos> The right people will.
- Okay, Todd, what's the real story?<eos> This was me.<eos> I found the bacon.<eos> Tandy caught me eating it, he had a little bit, too, but... this was all me.<eos> Surprise, surprise.<eos> The fat guy ate the bacon.<eos> And I'm so sorry.<eos> I'll never be able to forgive myself because I lied to all of you, and I lied to the woman that I love.<eos> And I'll take whatever punishment you guys think is fair.<eos> I will.
Mrs. Suzuki.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> - I shouldn't have...<eos> - I don't need an apology.<eos> I thought about what you said on the phone the other day, and...<eos> He could've been suicidal.<eos> Anyway, after you called, I started poking around.<eos> He had a beer fridge, and I found this in the freezer.<eos> I don't know what to make of it.<eos> Maybe you will.
Do I have to challenge you to another dance-off?<eos> Silence, Ravager.<eos> Guardian of the Galaxy, dude.<eos> You gave us our name.<eos> I mean, it was sarcastic when you said it.<eos> But still.<eos> Hey! Now you're making me mad.<eos> Get him, Drax.<eos> I have no quarrel with this man.<eos> But you will.
What is your main wish for that day?<eos> What do you want most of all?<eos> -Yes, Zin-mi?<eos> -To join the Children's Union.<eos> - To join the Children's Union?<eos> -Yes. - Take your seat.<eos> -Have some kimchi.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Zin-mi, you have to eat lots of kimchi.<eos> I will.
-Okay.<eos> Zin-mi, kimchi is our traditional food.<eos> Action!<eos> -Zin-mi.<eos> -What?<eos> -Have some soup.<eos> -Zin-mi.<eos> -What?<eos> -You have to eat lots of kimchi.<eos> -I will.
Well, I'll be damned.<eos> I think I'm falling in love.<eos> Hey. All I'm finding on the victim's computer are boring accounting docs, so think I'm gonna figure out how to rearrange those car seats.<eos> Yeah, um, Angie, do you have something to tell me?<eos> I'm not pregnant.<eos> Wow, you look way too relieved.<eos> Come on, we haven't really talked about this yet.<eos> But you know I've always wanted a big family.<eos> I think we need to think about this.<eos> Okay. I will.
I want you to know I feel very touched.<eos> I was just keeping your seat warm.<eos> And congratulations on the bugles, Chief.<eos> Well, all I can say is when Firehouse 51 plays 90 next summer in softball, y'all better bring it.<eos> - Oh, we're gonna bring it.<eos> - Yeah. Hey, you hear from Riddle?<eos> Yeah, I have it on good authority he's gonna be transferred to District 6. - Ooh.<eos> - That's airport duty?<eos> That's what I heard, but guys like him, they tend to have nine lives - at CFD, so keep one eye open.<eos> - I will.
Over my dead body.<eos> I told the magistrate you'd say that.<eos> Which is why he appointed them to help with the move.<eos> Get in the taxi, Nicholas. No!<eos> I said I'm not going!<eos> Get in!<eos> Let him go!<eos> Sir, need you to stand back.<eos> Stand back.<eos> Like bloody hell I will!
3,438,532,321.<eos> Thrashed ya!<eos> Combinatorics, that's what I do.<eos> Glorified dice throwing.<eos> Bloody nerve of you both.<eos> You fail on primes, then you think you can just turn round and crack partitions?<eos> Can't be done, I'm telling you.<eos> Especially not by you.<eos> It can.<eos> And I will.
Why's that?<eos> Well, LeeAnne has a big crush on you, and I know she was hoping you would go.<eos> You don't have a girlfriend, do you?<eos> Not currently.<eos> Well then, you should come.<eos> I'll tell Chase to make sure you're there.<eos> Okay.<eos> But don't tell LeeAnne I told you that.<eos> She'd kill me.<eos> I won't.
You know I don't like anyone seeing my work before it's done!<eos> You and your whole non-representational crowd are frauds!<eos> Shut up!<eos> You're so full of shit, Walter!<eos> Get outta my house!<eos> Get out of my big house!<eos> Go back to selling your coat hanger sculptures in Fisherman's Wharf!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> I don't want her ever invited here again.<eos> I won't.
My Lord, Rhesus is coming.<eos> I vouch my life on it.<eos> The longer Rhesus lives, the more villages will be burnt and the more innocents will be killed.<eos> Assemble your men.<eos> We march tomorrow.<eos> Hercules, the gods have offered us a gift.<eos> We must not squander it.<eos> Are your gods going to be fighting with us?<eos> No.<eos> The son of Zeus will.
He didn't come here to kick the hornet's nest, it just got kicked.<eos> - Cayden came back because he belongs here.<eos> - We all get to pay the price for it, Clara.<eos> - And this is Mayor Robinson.<eos> He's an optimist.<eos> No, John, I'm a realist.<eos> Connor is getting paranoid.<eos> If he thinks this kid has come here to... interfere with Angelina, then he and his pack are gonna come down from those hills and they'll kill him.<eos> And then they're gonna kill us for trying to hide him.<eos> - Maybe they won't.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid Annie and Jay are in deep motherfuckin' shit.<eos> Baby.<eos> All you had to do was email me and I would've taken it down.<eos> Do you have any idea how many people are makin' sex tapes out there?<eos> We get about 1,000 new ones every day.<eos> I don't need to be puttin' up sex tapes from people who don't want their sex tapes up there.<eos> There's no shortage of sex tapes.<eos> Okay? You didn't have to break my fuckin' door!<eos> We're just incredibly sorry, sir, and we will pay for all the damages.<eos> Yes, you will.
Future.<eos> I will decide by morning.<eos> Caesar.<eos> For years I was a prisoner in their lab...<eos> They cut me...<eos> Tortured me.<eos> You freed me.<eos> I would do anything you ask.<eos> But we must show strength!<eos> We will, Koba.
No, it's not that I don't remember, it's just...<eos> It feels like you've always been here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Weed must make me uncomfortably deep.<eos> Uh-huh. Um... I was in the third grade and I was the new girl, the giant, 5'3" new girl.<eos> And you were the only one who didn't laugh at me.<eos> I was too scared to laugh.<eos> You were enormous.<eos> No matter where we end up next year, we have to watch the spelling bee together.<eos> Of course we will.
Well, I heard a story on the news... about a guy who ate an undercooked pork chop and... got a worm that made his brain swell up super fast.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> And to relieve the pressure, they had to cut out a chunk of his skull.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Like a triangle of his skull, they cut it right out of his head... and they implanted it in his groin... so it wouldn't die.<eos> Otherwise, his brain would have... his head would have exploded.<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> The skull was holding his brain... which was swelling, and his head would have just exploded.<eos> Just think of that next time you eat pig bacon.<eos> I will.
Get in the corner, come on.<eos> Fuck!<eos> You have a choice now.<eos> We can stay here... and fight this thing.<eos> I can't...<eos> I will fight it... as hard as I can.<eos> Or...<eos> I can end this for you now.<eos> Before it gets... Messy... and painful.<eos> Because it will.
Hell, no.<eos> She should be apologizing to you.<eos> Why are you defending her?<eos> Because I am a mother, Michael, and I love my son more than anything in the world, and I can't even imagine the pain I would feel if Duke told me I wasn't invited to his wedding.<eos> So you know what? She may never like me.<eos> She may never think that I am good enough for her son but, what mother does?<eos> She has her flaws, Michael, yes.<eos> But she is the reason that you have become the man that you are and the man that I love so much.<eos> But she should still be apologizing to you.<eos> She won't, Michael.
Stay away from him.<eos> Curfew. You may not leave your place of residence between 9 P.M. and 6 A.M. without permission.<eos> I'm also authorized to randomly inspect your bank account and paycheck stubs.<eos> Let's get you to your accommodation.<eos> Mr. Garnett. You have been given a second chance at life.<eos> Take advantage of it.<eos> But let me remind you that one bad choice, even a little one,<eos> I'm going to put you back inside for those remaining three years.<eos> I hope you won't make me do that.<eos> I won't.
That's the proof.<eos> If you choose to follow us, you follow us.<eos> Simple as that.<eos> They burn out real fast.<eos> I see it in Uco.<eos> I've tried to ignore it, but it didn't work.<eos> I know Uco has that fire.<eos> I had to lose a lot in my life before I could truly see that that was important.<eos> I don't want the same to happen to my boy.<eos> He won't, sir.
"Bank of Loup"?<eos> Up near Wamego.<eos> How long since you been there, sir?<eos> 5, 6 weeks.<eos> Bank of Loup went bust.<eos> Happens all the time to... sod-buster banks in the territory. I've lost more than my fair share of this wild cat paper.<eos> D'you have any greenbacks?<eos> I spent it all.<eos> I'm sorry, sir. I cannot accept these banknotes.<eos> Nobody around here, will.
But I have to be honest... This is a very serious situation.<eos> We're talking to the ground, we'll try to find an alternate landing sites.<eos> But we are very low on fuel.<eos> Please pay very close attention to our flight crew.<eos> And if you believe in prayer... Now would be the time.<eos> Will you pray with me?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Still can't get signal. Keep trying.<eos> I will.
To get there, go back out and turn left.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Timur!<eos> Hello.<eos> Your daughter told me you were here. I was round at your place.<eos> I wanted to see you about... the vote on the bonus and me being laid off.<eos> Juliette and I saw Dumont. He'II let us hold another ballot Monday because... Jean-Marc influenced people by telling them that Dumont wanted to lay off staff anyway.<eos> So...<eos> I wanted to ask you if... if you'd vote for me to stay on Monday.<eos> Of course I will.
It is an Italian film.<eos> Uh, an art film.<eos> This is porno.<eos> No.<eos> Do you know about this?<eos> Sir, she doesn't know.<eos> It is an art film from Italy.<eos> What is this?<eos> Next time you see my face, show some respect.<eos> I will.
A spy ?<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> I know, it sounds absurd.<eos> Well, it doesn't matter what they think.<eos> You will tell them nothing.<eos> There's nothing to tell.<eos> So you'll say nothing.<eos> I can't just say nothing.<eos> You must.<eos> You will.
Natalie, why don't you try to not micro-manage their entire thing?<eos> I checked under the fridge.<eos> It's not there.<eos> - You lifted the fridge up?<eos> - I looked under it.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> I couldn't find it.<eos> When I do, I'll email it to you.<eos> I hope you find it.<eos> We Will.
I hope I'm not talking out of turn here, but Max told me that the reason he's taking the fight is because he wants to take you to Ireland.<eos> No need to be delicate.<eos> He wants to take me to Ireland before I die.<eos> I got it, but see, the thing is that Max and I could easily easily cover that trip.<eos> No.<eos> Sailor would never go for it, nor would I.<eos> But I would appreciate it if you and Max would be in my boy's corner.<eos> You gonna be at the fight?<eos> No. I've never seen one of Sailor's fights.<eos> Never will.
Before you came, she was so glum, and now she's all aglow.<eos> Pierre!<eos> Bring the boxes up to mademoiselle's room. Merci!<eos> What are those?<eos> Well, you know those dresses you were fawning over when we walked through town?<eos> I got them for you.<eos> All of them.<eos> I told you I was gonna pamper you.<eos> Shall I sell the beach house on the Jersey Shore?<eos> Then, I won't.
- Okay, I've set the timer for three minutes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And...<eos> One line is not pregnant, and plus sign...<eos> You are fucked.<eos> One line, one line, one line.<eos> Just going to take a big, stinky shit while we wait. Perfect.<eos> Cool timing.<eos> Don't stare at that stick. Okay.<eos> I'll just...
You're gonna be okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Here's the paperwork on him.<eos> It's two hours to Jefferson County.<eos> Sheriff's Department will meet you at the county line.<eos> All right.<eos> See you later.<eos> Christ, he's a big one.<eos> Stay alert, huh?<eos> We will.
Your department needed this win.<eos> Here to serve.<eos> I hope it hurts like hell.<eos> You heard from Emmett or Siobhan?<eos> No, why?<eos> I can't seem to get them on their cells or on the radio.<eos> You know what?<eos> They still got another half an hour.<eos> - Keep trying. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Come on, cut the shit.<eos> When do we bring him the cash?<eos> Not we.<eos> Me. - What do I do?<eos> - You get on a train, go to Canada.<eos> Live your life.<eos> 112,000, all in.<eos> - Don't want to count it?<eos> - Just make sure you keep your end.<eos> I will.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, you bastard.<eos> So I've looked over the paperwork and I'm signing nothing till we agree Mikey's share.<eos> Whoa, chill out, we'll talk business when I'm done.<eos> - Well, why not now?<eos> - Poker night, baby.<eos> I told you, this is how a man makes a living.<eos> We'll talk business when I'm done.<eos> Well, how long's that gonna be?<eos> As long as it takes for me to beat these dozy bastards.<eos> And I will.
Are you sure it's what you want?<eos> The only way of weaning him off the ventilator will be to give him a tracheotomy.<eos> A hole in the neck, bypassing the throat.<eos> He will never speak again.<eos> There's no question.<eos> Stephen must live.<eos> I will see he gets everything he needs.<eos> I will have him transferred back to Cambridge.<eos> He may not survive the journey.<eos> Yes, he will.
Let me test the waters.<eos> The Cult of Tusk.<eos> Membership, one.<eos> But that one disciple just so happens to be the most powerful man in the free world.<eos> For now.<eos> The entitlements.<eos> Raising the age of eligibility to 67.<eos> Your people will never go for it.<eos> They will if the leadership does.<eos> And the leadership will.
Fear already?<eos> You will not survive long in this cruel old world.<eos> Tell me of your master.<eos> Where is your master?<eos> Right behind you.<eos> Don't you feel him in the dark?<eos> On the back of your neck, his breath.<eos> Now one finger reaching out.<eos> Do you not feel it?<eos> Well, you soon will.
Then we will.<eos> I don't remember what happens really, but some things I do.<eos> You've been kind.<eos> Everybody.<eos> Not like you.<eos> I might have fallen in love with you.<eos> You don't mind me saying that?<eos> You still might.<eos> Don't let me hurt anyone.<eos> I won't.
What if you do not return?<eos> I will.<eos> And out of here forever.<eos> Daddy, I have fear.<eos> Do not worry, baby.<eos> Everything will be OK.<eos> Sure ...<eos> No...<eos> Mommy, I want to leave here!<eos> We will, baby.
Do you mean...?<eos> I've no news yet.<eos> But I've so much hope!<eos> Every night, I put a handful of stitches into this, tiny cross-stitches, like kisses.<eos> I suppose it's a prayer.<eos> A little present for the future.<eos> Sister Monica Joan, come in out of the rain.<eos> I have no need of shelter.<eos> But you, you, Dr Turner, if you wish to solve a mystery, you must read this book.<eos> I will.
His little heart is beating so fast.<eos> I'm gonna call you Whiskers.<eos> You like that?<eos> I think he likes it.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I think he's perfect.<eos> That's your new home.<eos> You like it?<eos> Do you like it here?<eos> He will.
I have a feeling it's gonna be a hell of a story.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> This is one fucked-up church.<eos> He's not who we came for.<eos> I'll make sure the cops stay away for the time being.<eos> - Buy you guys some time.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Hey, soldier boy.<eos> Still want to hear that story.<eos> You will.
I'll get help.<eos> Shh. Maester Aemon is coming.<eos> He's gonna make it all right.<eos> - Now.<eos> - Now!<eos> The outer gate won't hold.<eos> Take five men, hold the inner gate.<eos> Hold the gate.<eos> If they make it through...<eos> They won't.
No.<eos> No? No.<eos> And this... these things in your head, this is a remedy?<eos> Chinese in origin,<eos> I believe.<eos> Would you mind waiting while I... while I...<eos> Please.<eos> Deliver this to the spaniard.<eos> Nobody must know.<eos> Nobody will.
The Trags are planning an attack tonight at the carnival.<eos> - Can you stop it?<eos> - I can try.<eos> But Hadar is also planning on arming his soldiers inside the sector.<eos> Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I convinced him to take me there later tonight.<eos> But if I leave to stop the attack at the carnival, I won't be here to prevent him from mobilizing his army.<eos> Castor, if you want to prove to me that you've changed, you have got to stop Hadar.<eos> Of course I will.
! Please don't tell anybody.<eos> Please look, I'll do anything, OK.<eos> I'll get down on my hands and knees. I'll beg you if that's what you want me to.<eos> - Please!<eos> - Stop.<eos> Spencer, look at me.<eos> Don't take any more of these tonight, OK?<eos> And never take them with alcohol.<eos> If my parents find out...<eos> They won't.
It was more like a spiritual guidance type thing.<eos> The only difference was he had a degree.<eos> I could put you in touch'<eos> It's too risky.<eos> Just a suggestion.<eos> Let me know if you change your mind.<eos> Thanks.<eos> In the meantime, can you try to talk to Garrett?<eos> We really need his support with this.<eos> I will.
- Do you endorse my candidacy?<eos> Support? I support no one.<eos> I've been taken in the ass too many times.<eos> - We give you our word of honour. - Your word?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Honour?<eos> I have not earned a damn thing for two years.<eos> - Do you know about the transport center...<eos> - It will not happen.<eos> Yes, it will.
I know that.<eos> At least, I know it now.<eos> But I also know that Jacob needs to love, and be loved, just like any other human being.<eos> And the board have decided he'd be better off out of temptation's way.<eos> Have you asked Jacob his opinion?<eos> I would love to be like you, Mr Hereward.<eos> I would love to be young and zealous and full of ideals.<eos> But what happens in St Gideon's is real, and compromised and shabby.<eos> And that can change.<eos> Maybe one day it will.
Im not,<eos> I will not betray you..<eos> Do it quickly.<eos> Let him go .<eos> You will all fall away<eos> Rabbi,<eos> I will not fall away.<eos> I will lay down my life for you..<eos> Will you?<eos> I will.
- Okay, am I all right? - Yes. Okay.<eos> I'm here for a couple days and I'm going to San Diego, so I could do something...<eos> Oh, brother.<eos> It's a very high energy level.<eos> He-- you know, he just doesn't stop.<eos> He doesn't take a moment to catch his breath.<eos> He's got a million things on his mind at one time.<eos> I don't know that retirement is really in his vocabulary.<eos> And there are people here that are listening today who will see humans walk on mars.<eos> I won't, but they will.
Uh-oh. What's wrong?<eos> The zero day-- it's... it's gone.<eos> The flaw's been fixed.<eos> Isn't that what we wanted?<eos> No. We're too late.<eos> The Chechens have already accessed the GLONASS.<eos> They've gone in and locked the door behind them.<eos> Allahu Akbar. Will your tribe come get you?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, well, mine will... eventually.
There's nothing illegal about having three different profiles on okCupid, all right?<eos> - This has gone too far.<eos> - What'd you find?<eos> I've got to get my wife out of the city.<eos> I have to go.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I forgot a doctor's appointment.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> We need to finish talking about this.<eos> Oh, we will.
Then he can come back inside and autopsy my mangled corpse.<eos> You're prey zen about all this.<eos> Did you forget everything I taught you in that cell?<eos> Calmer heads will always prevail.<eos> But you do have people we can call, like your brother or your ex, who can in turn find Wes and threaten him or maim him or anything that doesn't involve your fangs on my neck.<eos> My brother told me to leave and not come back.<eos> I'm not calling him.<eos> So my life is not worth your pride?<eos> They won't come.<eos> Or they will.
She never came out.<eos> Neither did Markos.<eos> I know that's not a coincidence.<eos> It was her, uh, unfinished business.<eos> And Damon, uh... He finally had everything he wanted.<eos> He was happy.<eos> He should be here.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> Even if I wanted to apologize... you couldn't hear me.<eos> So I won't.
So I go in and take it the old-fashioned way.<eos> Except security in the file room is so old-school, you need a keycard to get in... which even if you had, you wouldn't know where to start looking for the file.<eos> An assistant DA would.<eos> You said you needed my help.<eos> Now I need yours.<eos> - What do you need?<eos> Know what I really miss about being home?<eos> My bed.<eos> I don't know if I even remember what a bed feels like anymore.<eos> And you probably never will.
My condolences, Dr. Thackery.<eos> Dr. Christiansen's untimely passing has brought added strain to The Knickerbocker.<eos> Aside from the public disaster it presents, it further hampers our efforts at financial solidity.<eos> As you can see, gentlemen, in the published reports in front of you, monthly costs have increased.<eos> This is due in part to the recent renovations in the men's and women's wards.<eos> The hospital is now running at a deficit of nearly $30,000 a year.<eos> Now, in light of this, I've taken the liberty of postponing the much-needed repairs in the courtyard.<eos> Now, Dr. Thackery, as you were Dr. Christiansen's Deputy Chief of Surgery, the board would like you to step into his position as Chief.<eos> We'd be grateful if you'd accept.<eos> I will, though with great regret.
But what about Jenny?<eos> We came with a... with a family who returned.<eos> The Thompsons, that African-American couple over there.<eos> They stayed with us last night.<eos> How about I'll bring 'em back to your house after they're done here?<eos> All right, if... if you say so.<eos> Come on, Jacob.<eos> We'll meet them back at the house.<eos> Tell Jenny not to forget her possum.<eos> I will.
Then you got in your car and you drove back to your office.<eos> You stopped on the way and you dumped the gun.<eos> Now, you could have dumped it anywhere, but you chose to dump it in a lake, which is a good idea. Great hiding spot.<eos> Of course, until David Ronaldo figured it out.<eos> Ronaldo got your goat, didn't he?<eos> I don't even know what you mean.<eos> Well, I mean that he wasn't nearly as clever as you, but he was determined.<eos> His persistence really paid off for him, didn't it?<eos> Well, you tell me.<eos> I will.
We played chess. And I lost badly.<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> Because of Henry Rivers?<eos> Hey, I got to take care of something.<eos> You want to meet up later? Yeah.<eos> I got to meet this lawyer. - So I'll call you after.<eos> - All right, cool.<eos> I'll buy the coffee, but I want you to do all the talking.<eos> I want to know what's going on.<eos> You will.
Well, I'm assuming that it's not an accident, our meeting in a hotel in Alton, Illinois, a half-hour outside of town.<eos> Freud probably said it best.<eos> There are no accidents.<eos> Then we're of the same mind.<eos> I think we are.<eos> And I think it's good that we clear this up.<eos> Anyway, uh, I imagine it's a difficult time.<eos> Ethan must be taking the breakup badly.<eos> He can't understand it.<eos> Well, he will...
Isn't it lovely?<eos> Dr. McKennah gave it to me.<eos> She said it's what ladies wear on other exotic worlds.<eos> I feel almost like a princess.<eos> You look lovely...<eos> Captain, I'm sorry for what I did.<eos> Even though I'm desperate to remain free.<eos> I shouldn't have manipulated your crewman.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No it won't.
You're right, Donnie.<eos> I should've trusted you.<eos> I programmed him to be intelligent, but I didn't realize how much he had evolved.<eos> Donnie, I'm sorry about Metalhead, bro.<eos> I didn't really mind it when he grabbed my face.<eos> His hands were soft...<eos> For a robot.<eos> Thanks, Mikey.<eos> Do you think you'll try building another Metalhead?<eos> Maybe I will...
Well, he's been around for a century.<eos> I doubt if my newbie abilities banished him for good. But maybe at least Remy can get a good night's sleep for once.<eos> You did good out there.<eos> I'm just glad I could do something.<eos> You know, I was thinking about what Price said.<eos> There's lots of books out there, but... this story, it hasn't been written yet.<eos> Caleb.<eos> Looks like Olivia's audio file is a dead end.<eos> I hope she gets some answers.<eos> She will.
Rem.<eos> Don't take this the wrong way, but you look exhausted.<eos> Just what every girl wants to hear from her boyfriend.<eos> So I'm still your boyfriend?<eos> As long as you understand it's not a part-time job.<eos> Understood.<eos> Okay.<eos> Rem, you have to get some rest, okay?<eos> We can't have you sleepwalking again.<eos> I will.
Mirakuru won't do anything against a head shot. - Sara.<eos> - Your mother's rally starts in half an hour.<eos> I'd start getting dressed, if I were you.<eos> She reminds me so much of me after I came home.<eos> When it just seemed...<eos> It seemed impossible to believe in anything even resembling hope.<eos> But you did.<eos> You did.<eos> Eventually.<eos> Sara will too.
A fine choice this day!<eos> Thank you!<eos> A fine choice, my lord!<eos> So I am married for the second time.<eos> As most of you know, my first marriage lasted less than an hour, because my own brother poisoned the drinks that day.<eos> Of course, the same thing can never happen twice, so let the wine be poured.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Here, here!<eos> Now who will be the first to drink in celebration?<eos> I will.
We should get back inside.<eos> I know that this sounds so selfish, but everyone in the house is connected to somebody by blood.<eos> I know that you don't need that to be a family, I know that.<eos> But sometimes I'm afraid that they won't love me as much as I love them because I'm not their biological mom.<eos> That they won't have that to tether them to me, when I'm driving them crazy or I won't give them what they want.<eos> Or I fail them.<eos> That they'll just... that they'll look at me and they'll say, "You're not my real mom."<eos> And walk away.<eos> Honey, to be honest, every mother's afraid that our children won't love us the way we love them.<eos> And they won't.
Well, then, Bill, you're the only one, because we are all selling something.<eos> I sold you on me, on what I could do for you.<eos> John Rock sold more than the birth control pill, he sold an idea, of pleasure without permanent consequence.<eos> He kicked open the door for you, but you've got to walk through it, stake your claim and say,<eos> "I'm in the pleasure business, too."<eos> That is not my business.<eos> I don't have a business.<eos> I have a study, a practise, and I haven't cured one single case of sexual dysfunction.<eos> Yet, yet.<eos> But you will.
Think you can play me for a fool?<eos> You must be drunk.<eos> Place your bets.<eos> $1,000 to start.<eos> I'll raise that.<eos> I bet my head and money that you have a 10 pair.<eos> I bet my head and money there's a card in her panty.<eos> Show your ass and take it all if you can.<eos> What will you bet?<eos> What if I won't?
Okay?<eos> Hey, Tommy.<eos> I'm Detective Lindsay. I'd like you to come with me.<eos> We're going down to the district office, keep you safe tonight.<eos> Listen, don't try to take this guy on again...<eos> - Kelly. - Kelly.<eos> From what I hear, you humiliated him.<eos> He's not gonna forget that, and he's not gonna fight fair, so if you see him again, I want you to call me, or Antonio or any of us.<eos> - I mean it.<eos> - I will.
How long will it last?<eos> The cramps, the sweats, The craving for it?<eos> The worst of the pain will be over in a few days.<eos> As to the craving, that may never leave.<eos> I'm not sure I can stand it.<eos> For kate, you can stand it.<eos> He knows.<eos> He can endure anything except betrayal, charlie.<eos> If he knew, we'd be already dead. So he does not know.<eos> He never will.
Don't expect my assistance in the matter.<eos> - Charlie.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Give me the map, wanker!<eos> I'm sorry you're not his favorite kitten anymore, Charlie, but that's none of my devising.<eos> So cut my throat.<eos> Leave me here to rot.<eos> I've been close to worse deaths.<eos> But do think he'll love you for it?<eos> In time, he will.
No.<eos> - James?<eos> - They've got her.<eos> The English, they've got Kate.<eos> Attention.<eos> Commander on deck.<eos> Are you familiar with how william Jagger interrogates women?<eos> If he does to Kate Balfour what he so delights in doing to unruly women, she'll submit and she'll send him here directly with his men and his guns.<eos> - If they arrive in force--<eos> - They will.
I love you, Katey-cakes.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Daddy.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Technically, it's only $26 million, but Carlos doesn't need to know that.<eos> Are you certain about using the real thing?<eos> Trust me, first thing Carlito's gonna do is check.<eos> The plan's gonna work.<eos> You just got to make sure your girls know what to do.<eos> They will.
It's a serious movie.<eos> Trotsky. There it is.<eos> But he's got a wife who never wears a bra.<eos> I think you're gonna like it.<eos> Thanks for dressing up, by the way.<eos> All right, back to this plate.<eos> I think you could use it for a variety of things.<eos> New item up there.<eos> How much you guys wanna pay for me to stick my socks in this moron's mouth?<eos> I will.
How the hell should I know?<eos> The baby.<eos> Oh, considering he's being cared for by a 20-year-old Russian whore, - could be worse.<eos> - It's freezing out.<eos> She brought him by our house in nothing but a onesie.<eos> It's, uh, some of Liam's old stuff.<eos> You'll make sure he's bundled up?<eos> How's Lip?<eos> Don't tell Mickey's wife where you got this, okay?<eos> I won't. Hey.
is a leash? Hard to imagine what else it could be.<eos> Which implies somebody was controlling it.<eos> Okay, so why the gem?<eos> What does it do?<eos> Could be just ornamental.<eos> No, someone went to far too much trouble to try and get it for it to be ornamental.<eos> It's gotta do something, or be something.<eos> The question is what?<eos> Too bad you can't ask whoever hired the gang to get it.<eos> Well, I will.
Is this the gem that they were after?<eos> London, 1836.<eos> Is that the same gem?<eos> Look who was helping Scotland Yard.<eos> Rebecca Reynolds.<eos> You think I'm related to this woman?<eos> It's a collar.<eos> What does it do?<eos> Too bad you can't ask whoever hired the gang to get it.<eos> Well, I will.
Then it won't be long until I'm reunited...<eos> Here. Allow me.<eos> You've ripped it!<eos> It's a cloak.<eos> It's Eric's cloak.<eos> And he's had it since before we met.<eos> He left it with me while he was away to keep him close, and now you have ruined it!<eos> If mending a cloak is our biggest obstacle, we're in fine shape.<eos> You realize you might not find him... or survive?<eos> I will.
Why would he do that?<eos> I don't know... to silence her?<eos> What if we've exposed her to danger from that man by getting her to talk to you about the past?<eos> 'Are you keeping a journal?<eos> It's my diary from before.<eos> The idea is it's supposed to help me remember more about what happened to me.<eos> And has it helped?<eos> I've not read it yet.<eos> Well, maybe it will help.<eos> Or maybe it won't.
Um, I wouldn't do that if I were you.<eos> I know what I'm doing, thank you.<eos> Yeah, but that's not gonna fool him.<eos> Look, it's not just your ass on the line, okay?<eos> It's mine, too. You can't just combine synthetic transuranic elements.<eos> You know that and he knows that.<eos> So, what?<eos> So, what if he tries that concoction on one of us, huh?<eos> You want to die?<eos> 'Cause you will.
- I brought Jessica with.<eos> - Yay.<eos> Well, this shouldn't be weird at all.<eos> - Hey, Redbone.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> - Did you see Field of Dreams?<eos> - No. Say it, Big John.<eos> "If you build it, they will come."<eos> - Yes, they will.
Jason?<eos> Wake up.<eos> I got coffee.<eos> - Careful, it's hot.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> It's Bill.<eos> He asked me to kill him with my light ball.<eos> What the hell?<eos> He says he wants me to have a normal life with kids and everything.<eos> But with him in the world, I never will. Wow.
Everyone needs to be on their A-game.<eos> Once the exchange is made, Slotko's gonna depart, I'll give the order to move in.<eos> And we will finally bring down Javier Acosta.<eos> Talking about.<eos> Drowning in that bottle, huh?<eos> Easy, D, you're gonna get through this.<eos> How's Silvia holding up?<eos> Devastated.<eos> Told her I'd find a way out of this, but... I don't know.<eos> And you will, bro.
Now I get up every night and keep that building spic and span.<eos> Because who doesn't like clean floors?<eos> Que será, será.<eos> What happened was part of a plan.<eos> No. Whatever this was, believe me, it was not part of some grand cosmic plan.<eos> We need to go.<eos> They're almost here.<eos> We're at the coordinates you sent, sir.<eos> But we can't get a visual on the targets.<eos> You will.
You have to know he was crazy about you.<eos> And so proud.<eos> That's why he passed you the torch.<eos> You're his son.<eos> You were his world.<eos> I miss him, you know?<eos> I do, too.<eos> No matter how bad it got between you guys, he always loved you.<eos> And never gave up on you, not for a second.<eos> Neither will I.
- Oh, no!<eos> But... but it's not ready.<eos> If we play the counterspell in the first round and it doesn't work, the Sirens will know what we're up to and make sure we don't get a chance to play it again.<eos> Then we'll have to buy ourselves some time so you can keep working on it.<eos> And how do you propose we do that?<eos> We compete in the battle of the bands for real.<eos> I take over lead vocals again and we stay alive until the finals.<eos> We unleash the counterspell then.<eos> You'll have figured it out by the finals, right?<eos> Of course she will.
I'm aware of that, Tyler.<eos> I think about it every day.<eos> So does Luke.<eos> A lot of you got your lives back, too, because of me.<eos> So, at the very least, do me a favor and lay off my brother.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Our twin powers don't work like that.<eos> You actually have to tell Luke to his face.<eos> Well, I will.
There are people who won't get back any part of their sons and their brothers and their husbands.<eos> They won't get back anything from the life before.<eos> But you have children.<eos> You have a home, you have so much more than most.<eos> You're wanted, you're needed.<eos> Everything is not over.<eos> Eddie, you are not nothing.<eos> You're my husband... ..and our children's father.<eos> I can't remember their faces.<eos> You will.
Police suspect his father, Kyle Walker.<eos> Anyone with information on this is asked to contact their local authorities.<eos> Of course, you can keep it right here for the very latest on this breaking news story.<eos> No mask?<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> We took care of the Brooke Ashton situation.<eos> - Suicide?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And the coroner will confirm?<eos> Yes, he will.
What?<eos> You dug into her.<eos> You removed the CMR.<eos> This whole thing, you just trying to cover up what you did?<eos> Because the Alec Sadler I know, the one I met two years ago, he would never have crossed that line.<eos> And you wouldn't have played on Carlos' grief to get rid of the evidence.<eos> The Alec that you met two years ago is dead.<eos> Or locked away somewhere.<eos> She wasn't using it, and technically I did invent it.<eos> Or I will.
Let's go.<eos> Herrmann, just the man I'm looking for.<eos> Nothing good ever comes out of that opening.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, you can judge it once I ask you.<eos> So...<eos> Donna and I are getting married on Saturday.<eos> Just a small ceremony.<eos> I would like it very much if you were to stand with me.<eos> That's just... that's great.<eos> Of course I will.
Stupid man.<eos> Stupid, stupid man.<eos> What did you say to distress Mrs. Woodhull?<eos> Please tell me, Ensign Baker.<eos> Don't scream. It's just me.<eos> It's just Abe.<eos> I thought you were Simcoe.<eos> Has he come by yet?<eos> - No.<eos> - Well, he will.
Stupid, stupid man.<eos> What did you say to distress Mrs. Woodhull?<eos> Please tell me, Ensign Baker.<eos> Don't scream. It's just me.<eos> It's just Abe.<eos> I thought you were Simcoe.<eos> Has he come by yet?<eos> - No.<eos> - Well, he will.<eos> Tomorrow-- tomorrow he will.
You look like shit.<eos> I can't go to a regular hospital.<eos> Too many fucking questions to answer.<eos> Gracias.<eos> Can we talk alone?<eos> They already patted me down, took my gat.<eos> Nice of you to visit.<eos> Where's Ghost?<eos> She won't let me fuck her in the ass.<eos> Her sister will, though.
Jake booty-texted me.<eos> Tamara-me, not Autumn-me.<eos> Well, technically, he booty-texted both of us, but the point is, Jakara is back on track to being the PHHSPC again. The PHHS Power Couple.<eos> Pause. Rewind.<eos> Are you saying you want to get back together with Jake?<eos> No!<eos> Yes?<eos> Maybe.<eos> So ditch the online persona and tell him the truth.<eos> I will.
I know it. I have a box of her things in my apartment.<eos> We've got to go back.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> They'll be staking out your place.<eos> Not Bracken's guys.<eos> Not now.<eos> And how about Donovan's guys?<eos> He'll have cops up there.<eos> There's no way we're getting near that place.<eos> We will.
Do you need another minute?<eos> No.<eos> Sheila...<eos> I know this wasn't easy.<eos> Call me, anytime.<eos> I can help with the grieving process.<eos> Thanks, but I won't be needing this.<eos> Keep it.<eos> You may, change your mind.<eos> I won't.
Despite what the rest of the world thinks, he was a great man.<eos> Do you know something that I don't?<eos> Yeah, smartass, I do.<eos> He saw in me what I see in you... angry hacker, chip on his shoulder.<eos> You have got the brilliance, but you also have the potential to go down the wrong path.<eos> You mean like letting a terrorist bankroll you?<eos> That's what they called me when we first met.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Just think about what I said.<eos> Yeah. I will.
Now I don't know what it is.<eos> It's the Darkness.<eos> Whatever it is, I won't rest until it's dead.<eos> You can't fight it.<eos> Maybe not alone, but I know where I can go for help.<eos> I was reminded of what being married could be like, and I realized I owe you an apology.<eos> I was unfeeling to you earlier because I was afraid.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of what might happen if Francis finds out.<eos> He won't.
Although, maybe...<eos> Drove a red BMW, you said?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Molly?<eos> Uh, we're going in.<eos> Dad, I gotta go.<eos> Well, there's two ways of looking at it.<eos> The first is you gotta.<eos> The second is you don't<eos> Will you...
Joe Bey said he wanted to take it for a test-drive, use it on a few animals, see how fast it worked.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Do me a favor and catch your partner up.<eos> I called him, but he didn't pick up.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> He went to the boxing gym the second we got home.<eos> I think he needed some time for himself.<eos> Well, he and I are still gonna have a little talk about that stunt he pulled today.<eos> Feel free to tell him I said so.<eos> Okay, I will.
Of course we do.<eos> Lead the way.<eos> Sir?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> She said I never lied to her.<eos> Today, I did.<eos> But she's alive.<eos> And safe. We did that at least.<eos> Why didn't you tell her the truth?<eos> I will.
What unknown effects do these frequencies have on us?<eos> Through sound, Mr. Segreto, they are able to experience other...frequencies.<eos> And now we have to teach others to hear these frequencies again.<eos> Tell me, if we could hear them, what, for example, would we hear?<eos> How to never die.<eos> Who else knows of your research?<eos> (CHUCKLES) Oh, well, there's stuff that I talk about on my radio show, but only Bill and me know the really mind-blowing parts of his theory.<eos> Well, it's been good talking to you, man.<eos> Mr. Segreto. (CLEARS THROAT) I thought that you came here so that we could talk about them.<eos> (WHISPERS) Oh, yeah, we will soon.
You have the support of the bureau, myself, my party, and your record is exemplary.<eos> Thank you, Congressman. It was difficult to pry Booth out of the field.<eos> Which is why he is the nominee.<eos> I can't tell you the number of positions that are filled by bureaucrats who have no real experience on the ground.<eos> Oh, the military taught me that you can't make the right decision without seeing the situation up close.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I am surprised that you're letting this one get away, Victor.<eos> It's not easy.<eos> Of course the opposition's gonna try and put you through the ringer, but don't you worry-- it's just a show. I have your records.<eos> I'll...
They require an audience with you today.<eos> Has he woken?<eos> Any moment now.<eos> It were an accident, ma'am.<eos> A wayward timber in the path, and we found ourselves at sixes and sevens.<eos> It's okay, Isaac.<eos> I know you've done your best.<eos> The Reverend summons me now, heaven knows why, but I fear each second he's made to wait...<eos> He will ask you to watch over Mr. Sibley.<eos> - He will?
I, uh, I overheard her talking to the detective.<eos> Uh, not from inside here, you didn't.<eos> No, I was, I was over there.<eos> But only for a minute or two. Come on!<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> Don't worry!<eos> I blended in.<eos> According to them, I'm just another nosy neighbor.<eos> What if they figure out you're a cop?<eos> They won't!
I don't even know what you are.<eos> You're both monsters.<eos> - And this...<eos> - What happened, happened, Miranda.<eos> The world that you thought only existed in bad dreams is the one that you're living in now.<eos> And it's never gonna go back to the way it was.<eos> - OK, it's all over.<eos> You're OK.<eos> - Wh... what if they come back?<eos> They won't.
Any more come in?<eos> Not for a while.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> - Webber was wrong. - Maybe you just need to...<eos> Really, Shane?<eos> I hung on his every word all year. All of us did.<eos> He's the greatest teacher I have ever had, so maybe if it were someone else saying this,<eos> I wouldn't believe them, but Webber?<eos> I got to find what I'm good at.<eos> And I will.

What?<eos> That's my line.<eos> I know, but Heather's here and I need to get back before she gets suspicious and my tail catches up.<eos> Whoa, hold up, Heather is here right now, downstairs?<eos> Yeah, surprise.<eos> Wow, it really is like old times:<eos> Me hiding in shadows, you hiding me.<eos> Yeah, and me lying to my sister, Tess covering for me.<eos> I am so sick of lying. I thought we were moving past all this.<eos> We will, somehow.
What the hell is going on in here?<eos> We were just catching up.<eos> That's nice, ladies.<eos> You four, in my office.<eos> - We have that meeting.<eos> - What meeting?<eos> Sorry, Don.<eos> Don't get no fresher than that.<eos> Who wants to try it?<eos> I will.
I've experience.<eos> I will determine where and when he...<eos> Now that man has 24-hour armed police protection...<eos> Your plan was full of holes.<eos> My plan was mutually agreed!<eos> Well, now your plan is up in smoke.<eos> And I have formulated the only viable alternative.<eos> Oh, for God's sake, what do you mean?<eos> How would you get to him?<eos> I won't.
Dingaan will cut the tether.<eos> I will draw their attention. You'll lead everybody out.<eos> Why have every skitter in the vicinity chasing after you?<eos> If they're chasing me, they won't be chasing you.<eos> Well, I think it's great.<eos> I think it's a fantastic plan.<eos> Has zero chance of success. What the hell?<eos> What's this Faraday suit?<eos> How do we know this thing's gonna work?<eos> It Will.
I didn't mean to.<eos> That might not do it.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> He was drunk, they're fighting.<eos> Most he gets is manslaughter for the brother.<eos> And Johnny's a fighter.<eos> Bobby may walk on self-defense.<eos> Which is why we need to get him for the trainer.<eos> Carrie have enough?<eos> She will.
But the biggest joke of all-- the thing that'll sink ya every time is hope.<eos> Hope that the world will right itself.<eos> That the just will be rewarded and the wicked punished.<eos> Oh, once you buy into that horseshit, you're dead in the water.<eos> The only way to survive in this disgusting godforsaken world is to take control.<eos> Ain't nobody gonna take care of our people but us.<eos> Dell hurt one of our own, we can't let him get away with that.<eos> Can't let... that degenerate prick win.<eos> He's got to pay.<eos> He will, Ma, he will.
Which means you intend to ignore it.<eos> The point is, I won't be hurried into anything. Not by you, or by him.<eos> But if you weren't certain, why on earth did you go to bed with him?<eos> Well, in my day, a lady was incapable of feeling physical attraction until she'd been instructed to do so by her mama.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> Seriously, my dear, you have to take control of your feelings, before they take control of you.<eos> Baxter.<eos> M'lady?<eos> I've thought a lot about what you told me yesterday, and I still think you should report Mr Coyle.<eos> I won't, m'lady.
She made it happen.<eos> With a little help from you.<eos> Actually, she ignored any of my advice.<eos> Oh, well... that is certainly very sad.<eos> Cos if she could smell a rat in you, she certainly was someone to believe in.<eos> What's this?<eos> Should I know?<eos> Should I start talking to IA?<eos> I don't believe we have an IA in the Secret Service...<eos> We will after this.
You are insignificant.<eos> You feel how invisible you are?<eos> That's why you did what you did for me.<eos> - Am I right about that? - Son of a bitch!<eos> You asshole!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> You're the nothing.<eos> We won't see her again.<eos> Get off me.<eos> No, sir, you will not.
That's why he killed Angie.<eos> That's the reason?<eos> Maybe I should thank him then.<eos> - What?<eos> - Angie's out now.<eos> Maybe that's the only way any of us are gonna get out.<eos> It didn't work for me.<eos> I died.<eos> I came back.<eos> Will she?
You on't want that.<eos> If this is some bullshit you're spinning an things go south...<eos> I know.<eos> I know the goo ones from the ba.<eos> Let us help you.<eos> What about you?<eos> You wanna live? How much?<eos> awn's afrai she'll look weak in front of us.<eos> Thinks it'll tip things against her.<eos> Hell, it will.
(door shuts)<eos> Hey!<eos> I need your help.<eos> (door opens, closes) We didn't anticipate the tunnel.<eos> Fausto's smart and ruthless.<eos> He will strike back.<eos> You taking the necessary steps?<eos> Protect your family?<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> He will.
One can only enter through Paradise.<eos> A secret order formed at the time of the First Crusade.<eos> The Old Man has always lived among them... granting access to Paradise.<eos> Is he a magic man?<eos> He is a holy man.<eos> I think you trade in black market fables.<eos> That's what I think.<eos> You have a much more genteel personality than your friend.<eos> It takes time... but he will soften... eventually.<eos> I will not.
Oh, I would've.<eos> But I already know what you did to make it up to me.<eos> Natasha told you?<eos> When?<eos> When she showed up at my place.<eos> Natasha's at your apartment? Okay. She's wanted by the FBI.<eos> Your apology was sounding a lot better a few seconds ago.<eos> She's a fugitive.<eos> What are you gonna do if she gets discovered?<eos> She won't.
Somebody's using my resources to pass classified secrets.<eos> And I thought that Borz might know about it, but...<eos> He was close to some people when he worked for me that were involved.<eos> That's what you couldn't tell me?<eos> I run a company that has several hundred million dollars in federal contracts, based in part on the fact that I can keep secrets.<eos> Anyone finds out that I have a mole, I'm ruined.<eos> Those contracts are gone, and the thousands of people who depend on me lose their jobs.<eos> If I have a mole, I need to find him myself before anyone else does.<eos> Did you find him yet?<eos> Not yet, but I will.
Well, let's save the fun for the courtroom, shall we?<eos> Stay civilized, young lady.<eos> Rebecca, let's go.<eos> She's a terrorist.<eos> Honestly. It... It makes me grateful for the miscarriages.<eos> Annie.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Imagine having a child like that.<eos> Asking for that second autopsy was a brilliant move, and I'd have done it myself if I didn't think that they'd find evidence against my client, which... let's face it...<eos> They probably will.
Who's that?<eos> Bonnie.<eos> What does she want?<eos> She needs us back at the office.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> You're not going to work.<eos> You just told me you have a drug addiction.<eos> We need to talk about this.<eos> I know.<eos> And we will.
Bigger question is, why are you?<eos> It's not like you to give up on family, Tom.<eos> I wanna talk to Lexi, Dan.<eos> She don't wanna talk to you.<eos> - She's too scared.<eos> - What's she afraid of?<eos> What'll happen when you wake up.<eos> - What, that the mission will fail?<eos> - No.<eos> - That it won't.
Salam Halabi.<eos> Radial fracture, multiple broken ribs, suspected hemothorax from intercostal hemorrhaging.<eos> We need to throw in a chest tube.<eos> I'm sorry, but you can't take this man.<eos> He is wanted by the authorities.<eos> We have to alert the police...<eos> - Molly: He'll die if you wait.<eos> - EMT: Before we admit him to the hospital.<eos> Then he'll die.<eos> No, he won't.
In your house?<eos> Is it safe?<eos> I have a spot.<eos> A spot?<eos> That nobody else knows about.<eos> Well, maybe you should tell us where this is.<eos> You know, just in case anything were to happen to you.<eos> Good-bye, hanna.<eos> Be careful please.<eos> I will.
No.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> Nothing in here's valuable.<eos> We just put the house on the market.<eos> It was supposed to be left without a scratch.<eos> It has to be in perfect condition.<eos> We need every penny we can get out of this place.<eos> Okay, let me go get some club soda and salt.<eos> Lydia, it'll come out.<eos> It will.
HOW?<eos> He caught me in a compromising position.<eos> Ray's clever.<eos> You're the only person in the world that he listens to.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> I'm his father, in a way, the one that cares about him.<eos> I'll set him straight.<eos> Ezra, thank you for being a reasonable man.<eos> You understand that Ray can't know I'm connected to anything that might happen.<eos> He won't.
- Within reason. - (Laughs)<eos> We almost got arrested in that closet at the Syracuse Library, remember?<eos> Uh, do I remember that?<eos> - I remember everything.<eos> - Of course you remember, yes.<eos> I tell you what, how about an easy one.<eos> You let me buy you a drink.<eos> No, that is way too easy.<eos> Think of something more exciting.<eos> I will.
Reed.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's late as far as the javelina are concerned.<eos> You're in the doghouse, huh?<eos> I warned you.<eos> Secrets have a way of coming out.<eos> Get dressed.<eos> We're going for a drive.<eos> I wouldn't know a javelina if it ran right past me.<eos> It won't.
By noon. I know.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too, Dad.<eos> Molly, Sammy, bon voyage.<eos> Come, Bassam.<eos> The fish won't wait forever.<eos> Salim, you need any help?<eos> I'm fine here, Mr. President.<eos> All you have to do is bring home some supper.<eos> I will.
You didn't want to let her go.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She's safe.<eos> I understand.<eos> I think I understand.<eos> But the people of Vega won't.<eos> Well, people don't need to know.<eos> People don't need to know anything, do they?<eos> No, and they never will.
I'm good with that too.<eos> Thisis anationalemergency.<eos> I've decided to catalog all the theories about where the Z virus came from.<eos> There's more than a few.<eos> Is it what the Zoroastrians would call Frashokereti?<eos> Or are we contaminated with Amazon brain rot?<eos> Or maybe we passed through the tail of a comet that sprinkled the earth with zombie dust.<eos> Or was it a defense department weaponized virus that escaped the lab?<eos> Or how about self fulfilling prophecy.<eos> Public fascination with all things zombie just willed it into existence.
- They're looking for him.<eos> - Should I do something?<eos> - They won't find him.<eos> They're so afraid of him.<eos> And I think they're afraid of me.<eos> It doesn't matter what they think.<eos> - Maggie's with them.<eos> - She used to believe in me, but now... - Everything's changing.<eos> - I haven't changed.<eos> I never will.
You're here to expand UNSC's power, nothing else.<eos> Without a clue about the cultures you assimilate.<eos> LOCKE: He says he's only a middleman.<eos> Told to carry some things to a landing site and not to ask any questions.<eos> But he did anyhow.<eos> He couldn't find out what he was carrying, but found out where it came from.<eos> He says it's sourced from a place no one will go.<eos> He says it's sourced from hell.<eos> A place so doomed even the Elites Zealots won't go there.<eos> So they but it from someone who will.
- Hey.<eos> - Hi, honey.<eos> - Look who's here. Huh?<eos> - Hi, yeah.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - I guess.<eos> I mean, Abel's a little freaked-out.<eos> Wants to know why he can't go back to school.<eos> Yeah. Just, uh, stay really close to<eos> - him today, all right? - I will.
Well, I don't know.<eos> But I tell you, if I find out, I'm not gonna tell you anything until I know why.<eos> I went to see Juice this morning... trying to piece together...<eos> Jax, I'm really sorry.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, I...<eos> I understand.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay, mano.<eos> Uh, yeah, if I see her, I'll, uh... I'll let you know.<eos> I will, I will.
This again?<eos> Okay, should I just come back later?<eos> Dassin, what are you doing?<eos> You're my boss!<eos> He's counting on me not shooting you.<eos> You wouldn't do that, would you?<eos> Frank wouldn't do that.<eos> Stay there!<eos> Be seeing you, Frank.<eos> Yes, you will.
I'll see myself out.<eos> Washington has repeatedly exploited Pakistan and interfered in our affairs.<eos> No self-respecting state can accept such dictates, not even from a superpower.<eos> It's a stain on our honor.<eos> If they want to break relations with us, I say good riddance.<eos> A career official in the Foreign Ministry,<eos> Tasneem Qureishi has emerged in the last few days as a leading...<eos> You're gonna drive yourself crazy.<eos> I wish it would just happen already.<eos> Maybe it never will.
Marge, I want you-- my wife-- to draft my fantasy football team.<eos> I-I don't really know that much about the...<eos> My team name is "Somewhere Over the Dwayne Bowe"<eos> and my password is "Annoyed Grunt."<eos> Draft with God, honey.<eos> Eat your broccoli.<eos> Martin's been secretly taking self-defense courses, and now he's beating up Nelson.<eos> Aah! His fat fists are a blur.<eos> I've never seen moves like that.<eos> And never will again.
- Before I agree to be part of it?<eos> - I hope you will agree.<eos> To our future as property magnates.<eos> Very well.<eos> I can see there's no escape, and I must tell the truth.<eos> - I've never caught you in a lie.<eos> - No, I don't lie, but there are things I don't say.<eos> I've allowed this folly to go on because... I don't know, really, because it was a nice idea.<eos> And I would have liked to come in with you, I would have...<eos> - But you won't.
No one will ever know what happened to Conrad.<eos> I promise, David.<eos> Can you imagine the headlines if they did?<eos> And we thought we'd create a scandal running away together. Remember?<eos> Seems like a lifetime ago.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> I used to think about that day on the beach.<eos> It helped keep me sane when I was about to break.<eos> I used to imagine our life if we had gotten away.<eos> This time, we will.
And if you had told me, maybe you would have saved us some trouble.<eos> Okay. Tell you what?<eos> That I threw Sidney in a mirror to help me kill Marian, but then I changed my mind?<eos> What's the point?<eos> You never would've believed me.<eos> I know you too well, Swan.<eos> So, stop trying to get me to forgive you, because it'll never happen.<eos> Stop it!<eos> You two need to mend your differences, otherwise, Storybrooke doesn't stand a chance.<eos> (CHUCKLES) We never will.
Look, you survived once today.<eos> Please don't push your luck.<eos> SWAT has cleared the room.<eos> There's deputies posted.<eos> There's no way he's getting back in here.<eos> I can help, Russell.<eos> Please, I need to do something.<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> Just... be careful and get out of there as soon as you can.<eos> I will.
Yeah. Including taking a piece of her to make more of his strings. I don't get it.<eos> Why didn't he just kill her?<eos> I'm sure Winthrop was probably trying to get information out of her.<eos> We know she was close to learning the truth.<eos> Did you get DNA results on the hair you found in the coffin?<eos> Yeah. It was a definite match to Briscoe and Winthrop's birth mother.<eos> D.B., Winthrop was definitely at that convent.<eos> He was there searching for his brother.<eos> - We can't prove that, though, right?<eos> - Oh, we will.
Oh, my God.<eos> Aah! Let me out!<eos> Let me out! Aah!<eos> We need the details of the Cronenberg case uploaded to ViCAP asap, and Cruz is expecting our assessments for his presentation to JCS and DOJ.<eos> Consider it d-o-n-e.<eos> And, Garcia, I owe you another one.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> All right, call me if you need me.<eos> I will.
I promise.<eos> Please. Please just let me go.<eos> Let you go?<eos> What, after you snuck into my home, hid here, waiting to kill me?<eos> You are a very sick young lady, and everyone knows that you're the one with psychiatric problems.<eos> You attacked me just like you did your ex-boyfriend, and I had to defend myself.<eos> I had no choice but to kill you.<eos> I mean, after all, you and Kenneth have been stalking me.<eos> No... no one's gonna believe that.<eos> Yes, they will.
Of course not.<eos> My hands were trapped here the entire time.<eos> Although, as you said, the urn dust didn't last long at all.<eos> I'd keep my distance if I were you.<eos> I wasn't the one who saved Emma.<eos> Elsa was.<eos> They really are quite wonderful together -- like sisters.<eos> Your strange fixation really holds no interest for me.<eos> But it should.<eos> And it will.
Why? Because it's not going the way you want it to?<eos> Because it's too difficult for you?<eos> What kind of man does that make you, huh?<eos> How will you face your God if you... kill an innocent man?<eos> Is your faith in him so weak?<eos> You're a good man, Booth.<eos> Don't let them take that away! Because that really will be the death of you.<eos> I just want this to stop.<eos> I want this to stop.<eos> It will.
What do you mean they're moving across C-deck?<eos> Which corridor are they using?<eos> The made their own corridor.<eos> They've been using the crystal to blast their way through our defences.<eos> Send all available droids to C-deck.<eos> We cannot let them escape with that crystal.<eos> This is not a good place to hide.<eos> We need to find a shuttle and get out of here.<eos> We can't let Grievous have the crystal.<eos> We won't.
Lady doutzen and her household will be returned home.<eos> Herr schuler was very helpful. You're a wonder.<eos> Queen, diplomat,<eos> White knight.<eos> Francis dealt with herr schuler directly.<eos> It was his doing.<eos> He's a good man, you know, and he'll make a good king.<eos> Your opinion is enough for me.<eos> And your lover, lady doutzen, When will she return to you?<eos> She won't.
- If you would open your ears --<eos> - Enough!<eos> You two are acting like two little boys. So I'm gonna have to handle this how my mother handled my two brothers.<eos> It's either you two work this out... or you kill each other.<eos> When Reefer Madness raised his offer, we invited the Thompsons over to try to convince them to raise theirs.<eos> We wanted to show them that the best thing about that house is its location.<eos> It's Dunphy-adjacent.<eos> That was so much fun.<eos> We'll hear from you soon, huh?<eos> You sure will.
Okay, but you do know I may... take this upstairs.<eos> Rattling cages like that takes a toll on your career.<eos> You ready to risk that just because your guy really wants to drive the truck?<eos> I do my job. I do it well.<eos> When I punch out, that's my business.<eos> It most certainly is.<eos> Everybody's on my ass for the drinking, but I don't bring that to work.<eos> My point is I do my job and the day I show up to work drunk, I'm telling you, Connie, and I mean this, you can fire me.<eos> All right.<eos> I will.
Same kind of machine logic you used when you murdered Edwin Borstein.<eos> Some math equations are more compelling than others.<eos> Yours is a one-to-one exchange:<eos> my brother for me.<eos> The equation you attribute to me trades one man's life for the chance to prevent billions of deaths.<eos> You're talking about nothing less than the survival of the species.<eos> Surely that's worth compromising one's values for?<eos> In any case... I think you're bluffing.<eos> You might want the world to believe that you're an automaton, a calculating machine... but you and I know better.<eos> Or we will, anyway... in a couple of hours.
Us not dancing.<eos> We probably should.<eos> Yeah, to be professional.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Ambassador Javani.<eos> I've been looking forward to meeting you, Madam Secretary.<eos> It's very generous of your host to offer us this piece of Canadian soil on which to meet.<eos> Since I am not allowed to step foot on yours outside of the, uh, - UN grounds in Manhattan.<eos> - Well, I'm hoping that our diplomatic status will change soon.<eos> It will.
Alvarez offered protection after the attack last night.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> - Are you? - Yes, Mom.<eos> I don't want to see you hurt.<eos> You were wrong.<eos> I'm not alone. I have David.<eos> Even after he reunited with Emily.<eos> You keep waiting for blowback, but it hasn't happened.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - It won't.
- And he's finally waking.<eos> Look, I know that we were under the Snow Queen's curse, but...<eos> We were under a curse.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Henry got away.<eos> So you failed.<eos> At kidnapping a child.<eos> Well, perhaps you could say my heart wasn't in it.<eos> The Snow Queen's plan also failed.<eos> But mine won't.
Maybe a... tall tale from a feeble, senile old man.<eos> I gotta go to the restroom.<eos> Well, that was a pathetic ploy, even for you, Dwayne.<eos> What's pathetic is you filing for an injunction to stop the exhumation of Jacob Tarlow to protect your father.<eos> First:<eos> Keep coming after my father, and I will make things very uncomfortable for you in this city.<eos> And second:<eos> You don't know that that injunction is me.<eos> I don't have to know.<eos> Judge will.
No problem.<eos> Instagram remembers for you.<eos> Peter, we've got a houseful of people coming and they're expecting a turkey.<eos> Well, if they're expecting a turkey, I'll just put on Evan Almighty for them.<eos> (gleefully):<eos> Zap!<eos> You and Brian better get another turkey right now!<eos> And don't bother coming back until you do!<eos> Don't worry, Lois.<eos> We will.
Add right tib/fib to the trauma films.<eos> Quiet!<eos> I got a pulse.<eos> Barely palpable, but it's there.<eos> Trauma two!<eos> Pierce, Shepherd, you're with me.<eos> She's alive?<eos> She is.<eos> You'll take care of her?<eos> I will.
It seems like whoever's making the decisions up there has got some kind of suck-ass criteria.<eos> Carl.<eos> Do you know why we came back?<eos> No.<eos> I do.<eos> Why?<eos> To be punished for our sins.<eos> I thought it was a second chance.<eos> I thought it could work.<eos> Oh, it never will.
A mighty ram.<eos> Moloch...<eos> Moloch.<eos> My son, let me pass and I will dispatch Moloch to hell and you will be free to live a life of your making, not a pawn in his game, but as a loved one in a world of free will.<eos> You... you would let me live while you go face Moloch and die?<eos> That is what sacrifice is.<eos> Allow me to fulfill my duty as a Witness and end this madness.<eos> Henry, let us pass!<eos> You never gave up on me.<eos> You never will.
Rick. Rick.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Uh I will be. I will be.<eos> Could... could we just pretend that everything between you and I is okay, just for a little bit?<eos> I could use that.<eos> I feel like everything is going wrong, and I have no idea what to do about it.<eos> I feel<eos> Like every single thing I am doing is wrong.<eos> You will figure it out.<eos> You will.
Unlike you.<eos> She wanted to experience ...<eos> Well, Everything!<eos> I've only give her pleasant beautiful memories.<eos> She fought me ...<eos> - Don't protect me!<eos> - No!<eos> Don't show me a map and not give me all the memories.<eos> - I thought we're gonna help.<eos> - We will.
This rotten town.<eos> Those it can't corrupt, it soils.<eos> It's soiled you, John Hartigan.<eos> Put that bottle down, Nancy.<eos> You've had enough.<eos> It made you lie to me.<eos> You're not even here right now.<eos> You said you'd never leave me.<eos> I never left you.<eos> I never will.
Bullshit.<eos> We're ripping this place a new asshole.<eos> Move or die.<eos> I hope you don't mind me saying this, but... you look hot.<eos> There's no reason to leave anybody alive.<eos> Nobody's innocent.<eos> And we can't leave anybody able to talk.<eos> Don't go soft on me, kid.<eos> Don't leave anybody breathing.<eos> I won't.
My hands were trapped here the entire time.<eos> Although, as you said, the urn dust didn't last long at all.<eos> I'd keep my distance if I were you. You really don't understand what's happening, do you?<eos> I wasn't the one who saved Emma.<eos> Elsa was.<eos> They really are quite wonderful together...<eos> like sisters.<eos> Your strange fixation really holds no interest for me.<eos> Oh, but it should.<eos> And it will.
Get up!<eos> Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir, and I'll request your presence.<eos> Let Your Highness command upon me to the which my duties are, with a most indissoluble tie, forever knit.<eos> Ride you this afternoon?<eos> Ay, my good Lord.<eos> We should have else desired your good advice in this day's council, but we'll take tomorrow.<eos> Is't far you ride?<eos> As far, my Lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper, go not my horse the better.<eos> Fail not our feast.<eos> My Lord, I will not.
Don't trust the right thing done for the wrong reason.<eos> The why of the thing, that's the foundation.<eos> And the foundation's solid.<eos> We farmers, we sit here every year when the rains fail and we say:<eos> "Next year."<eos> Well, next year ain't gonna save us, nor the one after that.<eos> This world's a treasure, Donald, but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.<eos> Mankind was born on Earth, it was never meant to die here.<eos> Tom will be all right, but you got to make things right with Murph.<eos> I will.
Come on, let's go.<eos> - You okay, sir? - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> This is really good barbecue.<eos> You don't want to regret not tryin' it.<eos> Why don't you stop wasting my time and just kill me?<eos> Even if Bobby was coming with the money, you'd still kill us both.<eos> But he's not coming.<eos> - He'll be here.<eos> - No.<eos> He won't.
Then, come the mistakes.<eos> The compromises.<eos> We create our own demons.<eos> Great to see you!<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> As promised, I got Pepper sorted out.<eos> It took some tinkering.<eos> But then I thought to myself, "Why stop there?"<eos> Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous, but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.<eos> And now, neither will I.
"As soon as the king took the crown in hand... "... the giants were slave... "... to his every command.<eos> "He sent them back to the place of their birth. "Their home now a prison between heaven and earth.<eos> "Erik severed the link... "... between giants and men."<eos> "And peace returned to his kingdom again.<eos> "The mystical relics... "... were all that remained... "... safe with Erik through the years that he reigned.<eos> "And when time came at last for King Erik to sleep... "... he took crown and seed with him... "... for permanent keep."<eos> "And as the king's bones slowly crumbled away... "... truth became legend."<eos> Or so people say.<eos> What will happen when the giants come back?<eos> They won't, son.
What happened with Wyatt and Goddard?<eos> Jack's a brilliant businessman.<eos> He was always able to imbue his products with a magic of big ideas, but Wyatt was the brains.<eos> Without his designs, none of it would have been possible.<eos> Hmm. Sounds like a perfect pairing.<eos> For Goddard, yes.<eos> Wyatt gave him the best years of his life.<eos> Jock lost his son Dylan to a drug overdose.<eos> So, if you talk about losing your mother...<eos> No, I won't.
I mean for Scare students who actually, you know, have a chance.<eos> Aw, snap!<eos> My chances are just as good as yours.<eos> You're not even in the same league with me.<eos> Just wait, hotshot.<eos> I'm going to scare circles around you this year.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'd like to see that.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You will.
And I forgive you.<eos> I want you to know that... your secret's safe with me.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, how's she doing?<eos> Stable.<eos> The doctors don't know what she took, so we just have to wait.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I guess I'm an old romantic.<eos> I always hoped that when I finally said "I love you" to someone... she'd say the same thing back.<eos> - And that someone will.
- That was better.<eos> - That's what I'm talking about!<eos> Guys, hold up a second.<eos> No, I gotta go. I gotta go. Hold on.<eos> I saw it all.<eos> She loved me.<eos> I know it.<eos> It's not fair what happened to her.<eos> And the same thing could happen to me.<eos> It won't.
Witness what happens when you defy me.<eos> Glinda did very well for herself today, I'll admit.<eos> Leave her alone!<eos> Unchain her, you witch!<eos> We know the truth.<eos> You poisoned the king!<eos> Guards!<eos> Get them under control.<eos> The citizens of Emerald City will not tolerate this!<eos> We will not!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> There should be more blood.<eos> Six months.<eos> What a mess.<eos> I thought we were home free.<eos> - What's Kate gonna tell the kids? Shh. Shh.<eos> I can't... I can't remember what they look like.<eos> You tell them I was thinking about them. I will.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course I will.
Hey, what's going on up there?<eos> What is this?<eos> That is the price of leaving the nest.<eos> Oh, who are you?<eos> You're pretty cool.<eos> Come over here!<eos> Where you going?<eos> Hey, don't be afraid.<eos> I'm not gonna eat you or anything.<eos> He will.
Hey, Chief.<eos> - This place is trashed.<eos> - Yeah, it was Bob Robertson, sir.<eos> I'm sure you're right. You always are.<eos> But he was long gone. Didn't leave a single print.<eos> Even the chalices were spotless.<eos> Weird, huh?<eos> I'll give my psychic magnetism a try to see if I can find him again.<eos> Take Stormy home first.<eos> - Like hell he will!
Montalbano?<eos> I'm here, sir.<eos> Montalbano?<eos> Montalbano?<eos> I'm still here, sir.<eos> That's my problem, you're always there instead of going to hell!<eos> And vanishing for good!<eos> But I'll make you pay this time.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - You will.
Casey. Okay, Casey, calm down, okay?<eos> I'm in the trunk on my friend's phone.<eos> Why can't you just trace it? BROOKE:<eos> We're gonna try. You're on a disposable phone, so it might take us a little while.<eos> What?<eos> You can't find me?<eos> BROOKE:<eos> I just need you... You can't find me?<eos> No, no, you have to find me!<eos> No. We will.
Not at that level.<eos> I tried to give it up.<eos> I tried everything I could to kick it.<eos> -I should have tried hypnotism.<eos> -You should.<eos> Maybe next time?<eos> Anyway, I did what all bad gamblers do I borrowed more and played for higher and higher stakes hoping that my luck would change.<eos> And when that didn't happen... ...I panicked.<eos> To various people invariousways I am in for money I don't have.<eos> Never will.
Janeen.<eos> She said that I could stay with her for a while.<eos> What should I do?<eos> You want to know if I think you should stay or go?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Henry.<eos> I think it's time that you lived your life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If only I knew what that meant.<eos> You will.
I just moved here from Chicago.<eos> I'm supposed to try out living with my dad this year.<eos> What happened?<eos> The official reason is I have an eating disorder and they think a new school environment will help.<eos> But really, I think my mom just wanted to get rid of me so she can fool around with her boyfriend.<eos> I understand.<eos> This guy, he just moved in with my mom and me.<eos> And now he wants you out.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - He will.
Let go!<eos> No.<eos> My baby's back!<eos> My baby's come back!<eos> Thank you!<eos> You're very welcome.<eos> Your Holiness.<eos> Your skills are greater than mine, your Holiness.<eos> Please help.<eos> No I won't.
- Are you sure?<eos> It's no trouble.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Happy New Year.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you too.<eos> You... got the light.<eos> OK. Thank you.<eos> You watch out for assholes.<eos> I will.
He says he needs to speak to a manager right away.<eos> Oh, thanks, sam.<eos> Hello, officer, this is norm woodsman.<eos> Apge, district manager, what can I do for you?<eos> Well, yes, we are missing a van.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Kevin, what happened to you?<eos> Now I really need to make sure you girls come back soon,<eos> And you tell all of your sorority sisters.<eos> Oh, we will.
What on earth are you doing, Toby?<eos> I just thought I'd give the fellows a snifter.<eos> You'll do no such thing!<eos> Give that bottle to me!<eos> Daisy...<eos> How do you think we'll ever make this place pay if you keep standing people drinks?<eos> They're old friends, Daisy. Locked up!<eos> That's the way of it.<eos> I won't have it.<eos> You won't?
Is that what you think?<eos> You destroyed us.<eos> You ran off in the middle of the night.<eos> We lost our standing.<eos> We were almost exiled.<eos> No, mom.<eos> I don't want your forgiveness.<eos> I came to forgive you... and tell you that I love you.<eos> Both of you.<eos> And I always will.
Years later, this report came out that Roosevelt might have known Pearl Harbor was coming and let it happen.<eos> That rattled around in my head for days.<eos> How horrible it would be if it were true.<eos> Then again, it's what got us into the war.<eos> A lot of men died.<eos> But in the end it saved millions.<eos> I bounced back and forth like that until I realized it was too big for me to judge.<eos> He was too big.<eos> I still don't see what that has to do with Batman.<eos> Maybe one day, you will.
How many?<eos> 2,000, Your Grace.<eos> Armored and mounted.<eos> Enough to make a difference?<eos> It's hard to collect wages from a corpse.<eos> I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.<eos> I imagine you're right.<eos> I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.<eos> He may not agree to meet.<eos> He will.
It's like he doesn't even wanna go home.<eos> Hey, guys, if we want to steal that radio from that plane, we'll have to use our heads and our brains.<eos> It's the same fucking thing, Storm.<eos> I think I'll go talk to him alone.<eos> I can still reason with him.<eos> - Are you sure, Chris?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> Just be careful, okay?<eos> I will.
Why do you laugh?<eos> One day, Lupo, all that you see here will fall under Rome's rule.<eos> And if that day happens a bit further down the road, because of Da Vinci's intervention... ..so be it.<eos> But he has the key.<eos> That makes him one step closer to obtaining the Book of Leaves.<eos> Let him keep it for now.<eos> At least we know where it is.<eos> And besides...the key is useless without its counterpart.<eos> And what if Da Vinci obtains that?<eos> He won't.
What if killing Ray... what if it didn't cure us?<eos> We could still be wolves.<eos> And God, I...<eos> I told you to kill him.<eos> No.<eos> - Yes, I did. - No.<eos> I never should've told you that.<eos> I'd do it all over again just to save you.<eos> But if it didn't work...<eos> It will.
- And I thought it was all going so well.<eos> - Fred, please...<eos> - No, you're right.<eos> Okay, fuck!<eos> This is crazy. We're going around in circles.<eos> I'm exhausted.<eos> Here's what we do.<eos> You're gonna go for your lunch thing, okay?<eos> - And then you're gonna call me.<eos> - I will.
Plants practice a form of it. Pollination.<eos> They seduce bees, bats, into transporting their seed. Because bats use echo to navigate.<eos> See?<eos> Plants have devised a way to exploit it. Cos normal leaves, they have weak reflections. But these concave petals, they... ..they reflect sound over a much larger area.<eos> Like a cave. And it draws the bats in.<eos> It's a consensual arrangement.<eos> The bats get nectar and the flowers get sex.<eos> Insanity is, of course, another defense at our disposal.<eos> You are demented if you think these charges will simply vanish.<eos> They will.
That's a Jewish surname.<eos> Explains why she's buried in a pauper's graveyard.<eos> Who is she?<eos> And what is she to Riario?<eos> Maybe only gets stiff for the stiff.<eos> You might be right.<eos> He's on the move.<eos> Maestro, look, we've been following Riario for days.<eos> - If he sees us...<eos> - He won't.
Will you?<eos> If revenge is your aim, you must overcome your apprehension.<eos> Now that we've established my propensity for directness, I have a question for you.<eos> Where is my Maestro?<eos> Have you ever tasted blood, Nico?<eos> It erm... possesses a peculiar saltiness.<eos> Don't bother, Nico.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> Wouldn't reveal anything even if he did.<eos> - Yes, he will.
Right at this moment he is...<eos> He is drinking ale with the gods.<eos> Yes.<eos> He is happier than even we are.<eos> With our boat and...<eos> These goods.<eos> Even so, he was my kinsman.<eos> We must avenge his death.<eos> It was done in the name of King Aelle, and King Aelle must suffer for it.<eos> One day, he will.
Because he's an immigrant farmer?<eos> Because your son is rich?<eos> Because he is my son.<eos> Sorry, Mr. Crawford, but everybody is equal under the eyes of God.<eos> Under the eyes of God, maybe, but not mine.<eos> "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy."<eos> God is on our side, too.<eos> The police are going to find him.<eos> They don't need me.<eos> Maybe they will.
They will certainly perish.<eos> I must stay focused.<eos> Remember who you are, Tenzin.<eos> You are the son of Avatar Aang.<eos> You are the hope for future generations of airbenders.<eos> The fate of the world rests on your shoulders.<eos> But what if I fail?<eos> Then your father's hope for the future dies with you.<eos> I can't fail!<eos> You will.
I came for Network<eos> - Why do not you come for your guy?<eos> - Red, this is the sent your men to the window of the church?<eos> Yes, but we to deal with it, obviously.<eos> Really?<eos> Because it seems just the opposite.<eos> I pay by direct this and ensure our interests , thing you're doing.<eos> And the question arises: where is my gold?<eos> Oh, I have, Judah.<eos> You will.
Sarah, God has spoken to me.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Lot, my nephew, walk with us.<eos> Abraham?<eos> He will lead us to a new home.<eos> But... we have a home, a good home.<eos> Away from the city to a new land... for our children.<eos> But you have no children.<eos> You can never have children.<eos> But we will.
All of them.<eos> Count them.<eos> Abraham.<eos> Count them.<eos> Count them.<eos> Our Creator-Shh. Who made the stars, will give us as many descendants-. Shh, shh, shh.<eos> He has promised.<eos> You will have a child.<eos> I won't.<eos> You will!
I will not.<eos> I will not betray you.<eos> Do it quickly.<eos> Let him go.<eos> You will all fall away.<eos> Rabbi.<eos> I will not fall away.<eos> I will lay down my life for you.<eos> Will you?<eos> I will.
All good things, all good things.<eos> No!<eos> This is not making much of a difference, is it?<eos> Olaf!<eos> Hang in there, guys!<eos> Go. Go faster!<eos> - Wait, what? - Hey!<eos> Kristoff!<eos> Don't come back!<eos> We won't.
Secret's out.<eos> We'll talk about it.<eos> But I need you to put out the lighter, okay?<eos> Look, Jesse...<eos> Jesse, I don't wanna kill you.<eos> And you don't wanna be killed.<eos> So put it out.<eos> He can't keep getting away with it!<eos> He can't keep getting away with it!<eos> He won't.
Is your phone broken?<eos> All 200 of them?<eos> Huell's gone.<eos> Huell's gone where?<eos> No idea. AWOL.<eos> Nobody's seen him.<eos> He's not answering his phone.<eos> So, what about Jesse?<eos> He hasn't shown up yet.<eos> He will, Saul.
- It doesn't fit.<eos> Shauli says you need extra-large.<eos> Don't worry, I'll give you a celebrity discount.<eos> - What's the deal?<eos> - Come look.<eos> Four thousand hits in two days.<eos> If that isn't stardom, what is?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Does anyone here know about this?<eos> By this weekend, everyone will.
Sam... I want to take you for coffee if you have time.<eos> I have a patient now.<eos> - (Cell phone rings)<eos> I'll call you.<eos> Hey, Savi.<eos> I only have a minute, okay, but there's some question about Thomas' death.<eos> Yeah, the insurance company is launching an investigation that my firm is handling.<eos> Now it's probably just a routine thing, but I thought you should be aware.<eos> Stay away from that family.<eos> I will. Yes.
And victims can sometimes broadcast victimhood involuntarily.<eos> Not me.<eos> That's not necessarily true.<eos> Your victimhood has a high profile.<eos> I'm a celebrity victim!<eos> Someone here asked me if I kept my stained clothes.<eos> How did that make you feel?<eos> Like I wanted to go home.<eos> But I don't have a home anymore, do I?<eos> You will.
"Caleb 6 months. "<eos> The way he's feeling, I'm not sure he'd want it right now, so maybe you could hold onto it for him.<eos> Just until he wants to see it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hanna.<eos> I've gotta get going. Yeah.<eos> You make sure he takes care of you.<eos> Yeah, he will.
And I'll lose my job.<eos> I just got this great job and I have nothing in my life besides this job.<eos> - I'll talk to the...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm going to sign the release.<eos> Worst decision that you'll ever make.<eos> She says she'll be happy.<eos> Right now she doesn't need to be happy.<eos> She needs to stop using.<eos> And she will.
I'm sorry.<eos> Could we get some more bread, please?<eos> Please, no more bread.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't want to eat it.<eos> Then don't.<eos> More bread, please.<eos> Are you going to eat it?<eos> I don't know, but somebody else might.<eos> I probably will.
We came with Alejandro, like, two years ago. But, we never went this far.<eos> But don't worry. I know where we are.<eos> That doesn't need a signal?<eos> No, it uses... It uses satellite.<eos> There are 12 geo-synchronous satellites that determine our global position.<eos> He has an older model, but it's still pretty accurate.<eos> Thank you, Jonah. Yeah.<eos> Hey, is there, like, a village or pueblo soon?<eos> Why? You need a toilet?<eos> Not right this minute, but I probably will.
...I will get some popcorn.<eos> I'm glad to have you back.<eos> I genuinely missed you.<eos> Before you say anything, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry that I attacked you at the reception.<eos> It's just, I saw you up there, singing with Blaine, and I saw the old, legendary chemistry.<eos> I saw two soul mates rediscovering each other, and I was jealous.<eos> Why couldn't that be me?<eos> Why can't I have that with someone?<eos> You will, just not with me.
When they found the tumour and took it out, he was back to his old self.<eos> He couldn't believe the things he'd done.<eos> I got him off, obviously.<eos> Maybe your mum's tumour was always there, making her the way she was, and it turned into cancer later.<eos> Anyway, it was good of you to take care of her like you did, seeing as you never got on.<eos> I visited her... every fortnight.<eos> So you do have a heart.<eos> She's dead.<eos> She won't know if I'm there or not.<eos> But you will.
So, I will say we spoke, that you are going to Warsaw and to follow...<eos> Yeah, but be careful.<eos> Small talk.<eos> Just a couple having breakfast.<eos> Talk about the...<eos> Michel, we know how to talk to each other.<eos> Of course.<eos> But you must explain that you are moving to the Amsterdam apartment, that you are leaving the French flat empty.<eos> How will we know if it works?<eos> It will.

That whole coffee thing, Meredith didn't mean anything by that.<eos> She's just trying to be thoughtful.<eos> I'm sure she was.<eos> So you're not mad? About what?<eos> About how comfortable your ex-wife is in your home and with your family, how she seems to know things about you that I don't know?<eos> Why would I be upset?<eos> Okay, see, this is why I wanted to stay at the Four Seasons, So you wouldn't have to deal with this.<eos> Castle, I shouldn't have to deal with this Because you should've said no.<eos> Yes, but I didn't, and now I can't. I know.<eos> I'll...
I'm a friend.<eos> I'm just really glad to see you.<eos> I thought for sure you were dead.<eos> - Have you spoken to anyone else?<eos> - No, nobody.<eos> It's been radio silence.<eos> Really?<eos> - What about Grace?<eos> - No. And she won't answer her computer.<eos> Nobody will.
Are you suggesting that we just go in and kill him?<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> We told Rick and Daryl that we'd stay put.<eos> I've changed my mind, sweetheart.<eos> Being on the sideline with my brother out there ain't sitting right with me.<eos> Glenn: The three of them are right in the middle of it.<eos> No idea we're coming.<eos> They could get taken hostage or killed.<eos> A thousand things could go wrong.<eos> And they will.
Especially when you're at the heart of it.<eos> That's a serious accusation.<eos> I'm aware of your situation, Mr. Caffrey,<eos> Your background, your father.<eos> What about my father?<eos> Keep it together, Neal.<eos> You accuse me of corruption when, in fact, It was James Bennett who was the real stain on Metro P.D. --<eos> A criminal posing as a cop.<eos> I'm sure you, of all people, can appreciate the irony.<eos> Oh, I will.
Okay, you see the tip?<eos> You see that?<eos> Push it in.<eos> Now, when that releases, the drill stops automatically.<eos> Now, look at me.<eos> You need to start right here.<eos> Okay?<eos> Steady.<eos> Promise me it will stop.<eos> It will.
I'm sorry if I was a know-it-all.<eos> You were just trying to have some fun, even though the puzzle was too difficult for you.<eos> Mm-hmm. it's okay, Bones.<eos> You're not a know-it-all.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> 'Cause you didn't know about Ginger or Mary Ann or the Howells.<eos> And I bet you didn't know that the Globetrotters were g u e sts o n Gi/I/jgan is Island.<eos> Better consult your atlas is what you should do.<eos> I will.
Now you'll go home and you'll find everything right where it belongs.<eos> I'm really not you, am I?<eos> Why would you want to be?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Look what you did.<eos> You came out here, you staked this out on your own.<eos> I always had Dennis to fall back on.<eos> Even when I went to Mary Kay.<eos> You didn't.<eos> And I never will.
And I thought it was causing your-- Your violent episodes.<eos> I was only trying to make you better.<eos> Well, it worked really well, didn't it?<eos> You're a hell of a doctor!<eos> I only wanted what was best for you.<eos> I still do.<eos> That's why you sent your friend after me.<eos> I asked him to protect me. I had no choice.<eos> You should've just left me alone.<eos> I will.

You want something hot?<eos> I got frozen patties from Costco.<eos> Can fry them up it'd just take a sec.<eos> Not hungry.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> I need lipstick and eye stuff.<eos> Number 483. Pretty in pink.<eos> It'll look good on me don't you think?<eos> You got my coloring.<eos> Sure it will.
Well, Elijah, there was no dialogue to have.<eos> You're not a nice man, okay?<eos> - You're a fink.<eos> - I'm a fink?<eos> Yes, there's certain people, Elijah, who are meant to remain in your past, all right?<eos> I made a mistake trying to repurpose you.<eos> - Repurpose me? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm not a vintage cardigan.<eos> Also, I will not be paying rent this month. - Uh, yeah, you will.<eos> - Actually, no, I won't.
Read all about it!<eos> Japan bombs America!<eos> Read all about it!<eos> KING LEAR<eos> - Thanks, sir.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Sir... I don't like to ask, but...<eos> Why are we even going there?<eos> They won't take me.<eos> They will.
But I want something different.<eos> Like on the Internet.<eos> Proposing while parachuting or underwater.<eos> I really want something interesting.<eos> Right.<eos> I've got some ideas.<eos> But I want something simpler and more permanent.<eos> We should do it, Kubi.<eos> We should make it succeed.<eos> Of course we will.
- Oh... You all right?<eos> You're okay.<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Patrick.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> I told you, I need to do this on my own.<eos> No, you need my help now.<eos> The police will be here very soon.<eos> Do they know I'm here?<eos> No, not yet. But they soon will.
- That is so stupid!<eos> You don't know the first thing about owning a hospital or running one, and neither do I.<eos> Well, Pegasus Horizons knows how not to run a hospital.<eos> I mean, you should hear Callie's stories.<eos> It's this or go somewhere else. No.<eos> N-no one leaves.<eos> Owen says if people start leaving, the sale won't go through, and we're screwed.<eos> That's why we want to buy it, because we're doctors, and we know how it runs.<eos> Did you know you'll have to file a declaration for land use for approval by the state attorney general?<eos> Will we?
She would never do something like this.<eos> - Then who did?<eos> - Quiet!<eos> Ahsoka!<eos> It's me, Anakin!<eos> Stop running!<eos> You can't help me, Master.<eos> Someone's setting me up!<eos> I believe you, Ahsoka!<eos> But no one else will!
No.<eos> You saw how many soldiers there are.<eos> It is suicide.<eos> I have friends coming back for me and I'm gonna return with all of them.<eos> All right.<eos> But if you can't, don't feel bad.<eos> Sometimes, no matter how much you want to help you can't stop someone from dying.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> Don't you want to see your daughter again?<eos> I will.
Don't be.<eos> Because I'm just gonna say it I think it's super creepy you get sexually aroused by physical violence.<eos> Well, but also emotional violence.<eos> Wow.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's even creepier.<eos> So are you gonna open the damn door?<eos> As soon as you give me that weapon.<eos> Do you honestly wanna live through the rise of the machines?<eos> Which you won't, because no one will?
I think you love anything lets you put your head on the pillow at night believing' you ain't the bad guy.<eos> So, you face off with Nicky, and he says, "I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> "Never even knew you had a family." Then what?<eos> You tell him anything he says can be used against him?<eos> Nothing gonna be used against him. This ends tonight.<eos> Well, maybe you get him to pull, count it down like you did that old gun thug in Miami.<eos> Figure if it ain't broke...<eos> Well, what if he won't pull?<eos> They always pull.<eos> Well, what if he won't?
- Yeah.<eos> Why don't we talk about it for six months?<eos> Did you use your tools?<eos> Well, you're clearly having a worse day than usual.<eos> Why, because I'm not my usual ray of goddamn sunshine?<eos> Well, let's try to turn it around today.<eos> Talk about the positive things we can take from negative experiences.<eos> For example, I just found another reason not to be sad when my dad dies.<eos> - Who wants to go next?<eos> - I will.
Your PO finds out you've been talking to your old friends, you go back in.<eos> For what?<eos> Nothing. Hey, hey, I just wanted to help, man.<eos> Why don't you help yourself for a change, huh?<eos> You can't understand that I... that I... that I might want to do something that matters?<eos> Look, I know what you're going through.<eos> No, no, man, you got no idea.<eos> Andre... You got no idea what this is like.<eos> But who knows?<eos> Maybe someday... you will.
Private security firm.<eos> Perfect way to satisfy her inner cop.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> And one of their clients was a tech startup in the Empire State Building.<eos> That's got to be it.<eos> Well, the question is, how do we search it?<eos> We don't.<eos> We keep our distance and let Neal search on his own.<eos> Does he know where to look?<eos> He will.
I have loved, I do love.<eos> Who do you love that you are so sure of this?<eos> I love Hal Jordan of Earth.<eos> And who does he love?<eos> He loves another.<eos> So your love has brought you nothing but pain.<eos> Yes.<eos> I mean, no.<eos> How will that pain bring peace to the Universe?<eos> It will...
I never thought I'd feel like this again.<eos> You're everything that's good in my life.<eos> We've been through so much together.<eos> I need you, Christine, I want you and I...<eos> I can't imagine my life without you.<eos> I don't want to...<eos> I just want to spend the rest of my life with you by my side.<eos> Christine... will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course I will.
My grandfather carved the handle himself.<eos> Took it with him to Korea.<eos> When he made it back in one piece, that made the knife a good luck charm.<eos> So... When my dad shipped out for Vietnam, he took it with him.<eos> He made it back home too, which made the damn thing Miracle lucky.<eos> Here.<eos> Make sure you always come back alive.<eos> Miles, I can't take this.<eos> I... I-I don't want this.<eos> One day, maybe your son will.
- I'm not gonna let that happen, Sean.<eos> Yolanda?<eos> No, you won't, Ray.<eos> You know why?<eos> Look at her.<eos> She's so innocent.<eos> So pure.<eos> She's my little angel.<eos> You can't let anyone hurt my family, Ray.<eos> I won't.
I'd never even heard of. You think someone's trying to frame you.<eos> Man, I think someone is trying to bury me, and I'm not gonna hand them the shovel.<eos> I mean, look, you told me about you're investigation, didn't you?<eos> Clearly you have your own doubts about the bureau right now.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm believe whatever is on that tape.<eos> Tomorrow Clayton is gonna pick us up in the getaway car,<eos> Juan's car.<eos> We get the car, I get the tape, and then I'm gonna know the truth.<eos> Yes, you will.
He was Elizabeth's first recruit, her agent.<eos> I've had my differences with her but if this ends the hard way, I don't want her to have to do it.<eos> - You'll be there?<eos> - Of course.<eos> So we know who killed Chris.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't have him yet.<eos> But you will, right?
Ah, why so, my Lord Borgia?<eos> Because it would mean the end of a certain life for me.<eos> Your father has mentioned the possibility of a French bride.<eos> What would France say to that?<eos> Beauty and blessings all round.<eos> Our little pack of wolves.<eos> What is their price?<eos> Land. The restoration of what has been taken from them.<eos> Tell them if they pledge their swords to me, they shall have all they had before, and the Borgia estates I will divide among them.<eos> I will.
I'll get it.<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> Hi!<eos> Ready?<eos> Hi, ma'am.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Good, you?<eos> Don't be late.<eos> Call if you need to.<eos> I will.
Ah, so that was the reason.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> He wasn't exactly enthralled to the cause of the Liberals.<eos> Though I'm not now convinced by his Socialism.<eos> Why not?<eos> I didn't know then that you were the land agent and son-in-law of our local milord.<eos> I'm surprised I'm so famous.<eos> Won't you defend your principles?<eos> No, not now.<eos> Then I will.
Then I'll ask him straight out to dismiss his valet.<eos> I won't say why.<eos> That makes me so nervous.<eos> Don't be.<eos> No-one needs to know the reason.<eos> Green simply won't be back at Downton again.<eos> Is Bates going to challenge Lord Gillingham as to why he has a different valet?<eos> I suppose not.<eos> So you have nothing to fear if he pays us a visit.<eos> And will he, m'lady?
- Don't want you getting mixed up in this.<eos> - For Pete's sake, Clyde, take the gun.<eos> Don't take it.<eos> - We'll be in federal lockup by Friday.<eos> - Well, nobody asked you, cracker.<eos> You got one minute.<eos> Clyde Barrow, if anything's meant to be between us I think it better start being now.<eos> - It's empty.<eos> - Well, I didn't know that.<eos> And neither will they.
Tony, I'm engaged.<eos> She's an officer in the USS Delarue.<eos> Met about a year ago.<eos> Right.<eos> Connie's completing her next tour, then taking a gig in Navy Intel. Oh.<eos> Guess my agent afloat days are over, huh?<eos> Good for you, Stan.<eos> Yeah, it's gonna be a whole new chapter for me.<eos> You should try it.<eos> Maybe I will.
Impossible. Simatech was only certified for the toxin this year.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah, you can go now.<eos> This fall, we are gonna drive through New England, see the leaves turn.<eos> I know this great inn that you would love.<eos> And you can teach me how to make your abgoosht.<eos> I am so sorry that... I was too busy last weekend.<eos> You are gonna get through this, Arastoo.<eos> You Will.
So you never have to think of me again?<eos> Helen...<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm just so tired of it.<eos> The tests.<eos> The experiments, the pain.<eos> Please.<eos> Amanda, make it stop.<eos> I will.
Helen...<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm just so tired of it.<eos> The tests.<eos> The experiments, the pain.<eos> Please.<eos> Amanda, make it stop.<eos> I will.<eos> You will?
- Welcome back.<eos> - We were just looking over the footage from that night.<eos> - We didn't want to bother you while you were...<eos> - Shaking off the crazy. - It's true.<eos> - Play it.<eos> That's Charlie.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - That's his ear.<eos> Please pass on my regards to your wife.<eos> I will.
Yeah.<eos> You crossed a line, Dino.<eos> I'm sorry you feel that way.<eos> How I feel... isn't the point.<eos> How you understand your job, that is the point.<eos> Sometimes you're not gonna like yourself very much for the decisions you have to make;<eos> knowing how the men feel about the decision you made... but you're gonna have to make that tough decision again and again because that is the job you accepted.<eos> I get that.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> But you will.
That is all.<eos> I helped him.<eos> No one else, nothing more.<eos> Just a sister helping a brother to serve his pope.<eos> But he is a man, is he not?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Men are false.<eos> We had thought to purge our Vatican.<eos> As though the fresh blood of new cardinals would wash it clean.<eos> But it will not.
Let me in there.<eos> You hooked him real good.<eos> Come here, you little bugger.<eos> Throw it back.<eos> It's a catfish, cuz.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> Every life matters.<eos> Throw it back.<eos> What if it don't work out?<eos> Well, hey, it will.
Heroic, even.<eos> Guys like you don't get that chance very often.<eos> - Guys like me?<eos> - Brainiacs.<eos> You know, geniuses.<eos> You park yourself behind the computer, and you change the world keystroke by keystroke.<eos> But no one understands that heroism.<eos> Naturally, you wanna dream a little larger.<eos> And Alec, believe me.<eos> You will.
You molded her well.<eos> She came that way.<eos> Gentlemen... from all accounts, you and Eli left off in a good place.<eos> I hope we can start there.<eos> This faction poses a threat to your agents as well.<eos> If we act together, we are stronger.<eos> So the FBI has Officer Mantel's body?<eos> No.<eos> You do.<eos> Or you will momentarily.
Listen, I was thinking about coming to the studio later to see your interview.<eos> That is, if you think your father won't mind.<eos> No.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> I... I'd love to have you there.<eos> Great.<eos> I'll see you then.<eos> I love the Jedi mind trick on Danny boy.<eos> But it'll all be for bubkes if I can't break the Falcon.<eos> You will.
Okay.<eos> I don't love you.<eos> I want a divorce.<eos> Are you sure it's Judge Gates?<eos> In two pieces.<eos> Damn.<eos> The Mexicans didn't want the body.<eos> The feds?<eos> They don't know yet.<eos> Well, they will.
You poisoned this well?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Then how did this get here?<eos> [Coughing] - You swallow any of that water?<eos> - Oh, God, I don't know.<eos> [Coughs] Hemlock takes about an hour to work its way into your system.<eos> Ambulance may not get here in time, but if we hurry...<eos> Please, get me to a hospital. I will.<eos> I will. Not just yet.
You will test it tomorrow, on me.<eos> I must let you get back to your lab and ensure your calculations are correct.<eos> Tomorrow, van Helsing.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> I thought I told you specifically to keep this to yourself!<eos> I had no choice.<eos> General Shaw is a traitor.<eos> You know, I admire your patriotism, Harker.<eos> If anyone should even suspect that I had anything to do with this...<eos> They won't.
No. It's my fault.<eos> You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I-I drove her away.<eos> Oh, Raj.<eos> Penny, I...<eos> I miss her already.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I miss Leonard, too.<eos> What's... what is wrong with me?<eos> Why-why can't I ever have love?<eos> You will.
At least he'll still be around.<eos> Yeah, with his name on our reports.<eos> Look, I'm sure it's been hard for him on the road.<eos> He's not going to admit it, but a desk job would be easier on Jack.<eos> He'll suffocate.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I don't have kids?<eos> I would have.<eos> Spence... You still will.
It's what they do with it.<eos> You're right, Mike.<eos> It matters who you are.<eos> I could, you know?<eos> Be a hero.<eos> I'm counting on it.<eos> Subject is in stable condition.<eos> All clear at Union Station.<eos> I told him his father was coming home.<eos> He will.
- I'm gonna play you back into Iran.<eos> From now on, you work for us.<eos> For me.<eos> I'm your new case officer.<eos> It won't work.<eos> - Why's that?<eos> - You burned me back home. - How?<eos> - I'm here with you.<eos> - They don't know that.<eos> - They will.
What's the deal?<eos> Neighbor's security camera picked me up.<eos> There's an APB out.<eos> - Just you?<eos> - Somehow it missed Javadi and Carrie. - Where'd you get this?<eos> - Dar Adal, he monitors the blotters.<eos> He knows Javadi's in the country?<eos> He knows something's up he's not in on.<eos> I suggest you go talk to him soon.<eos> - I will.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.<eos> That's against the law.<eos> Maybe I took in by mistake.<eos> Maybe he left it somewhere and I found it.<eos> He called.<eos> The killer.<eos> And...<eos> The FBI knew about Cristina and the video.<eos> That's why they won't share their files.<eos> Well, they will now.
- Keep looking.<eos> I'm telling you, they've got something big planned for him.<eos> They'll never see him coming.<eos> It will be trickier without Peller but we'll make it work.<eos> It had to be done.<eos> You wasted a valuable asset.<eos> We can't see this through as designed without Peller in place.<eos> We have the Stuxworm.<eos> We can improvise.<eos> Oh, I Will.
We are gonna need a name.<eos> I could lose my job!<eos> I broke the law!<eos> Her name was...<eos> I don't know. Drake.<eos> Cece, I think.<eos> Just take the money and drop it, all right?<eos> Let him go!<eos> That guy was never gonna tell us the whole story anyway.<eos> But maybe this will.
And while I've gotten used to being alone inside this bottle for years at a time, the thought of spending an eternity there without you... it's too much for me to bear.<eos> But if I don't make my wishes, you'll never go back inside.<eos> Everyone makes their wishes.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - You say that now, but I've lived countless lifetimes and no one has ever not made their wishes.<eos> Why would I wish for anything?<eos> I have everything I could possibly wish for.<eos> You are everything I've ever wished for, Cyrus.<eos> What if you change your mind?<eos> I won't.
What is it?<eos> He says that you are to leave here.<eos> We will take you over the ridge.<eos> There are white men there.<eos> They can help you.<eos> But... you must leave this place.<eos> You are banished from here.<eos> You must never return.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> We won't.
I didn't hear... I mean, what's attacking him?<eos> Whatever it was, it was close.<eos> You sure I got enough wire?<eos> You said you needed it for the whole roof.<eos> No.<eos> We don't need that much.<eos> I was wrong about that.<eos> It's actually good-- we don't need hardly as much.<eos> Well, be careful.<eos> I will.
- She obviously needs help.<eos> So what are you saying?<eos> Just put her over the line and that's it?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You can't.<eos> She can't even walk.<eos> That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard.<eos> - But they'll come.<eos> - No, they won't!
I could finally put names to faces.<eos> We'd know the players.<eos> We could start pulling them apart, playing them against each other.<eos> I just... I couldn't pass it up.<eos> But then I got there, and I knew. I knew it in my bones, man.<eos> Something wasn't right.<eos> Benito.<eos> - How'd they find you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Probably never will.
Don't go to sleep very late.<eos> Try to sleep early and rest.<eos> What time is school?<eos> 10 am.<eos> Classes are from 10 am to 6 pm.<eos> In life there's nothing more important than school.<eos> The instruction...<eos> You are lucky to be able to study.<eos> You'll need to be responsible and if so, you'll succeed.<eos> - If Allah wills!

That's a telegram.<eos> From Durant.<eos> Asking me to come to Cheyenne.<eos> What for?<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd say he's surrendering.<eos> He knows we're gonna be in Cheyenne tomorrow and wants to broker a deal.<eos> Know what that means?<eos> We won the damn war, damn it.<eos> Ain't none of us out here never won nothin'.<eos> And never will.
I couldn't let him take me away -- not -- not with Bonnie in her condition.<eos> It was either him or your wife.<eos> Yes.<eos> Lee, baby.<eos> I am not getting better.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> You have to.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I never will.
I have mine.<eos> My partners have a very low tolerance for failure.<eos> It's a delay. Not a failure.<eos> I'm not sure there's a distinction. Not in this context.<eos> What Duncan is trying to say is, we can still right the ship.<eos> Except for the delay, nothing has changed.<eos> The key players remain in position to execute the plan.<eos> Except now the Secret Service is investigating.<eos> Now you tell me what happens when they discover that Dr. Sanders is responsible for the blood thinner.<eos> They won't.
Oh, trust me, logic is not our friend here.<eos> - He was lost.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Where are Kate and Humphrey?<eos> Under Marcel.<eos> That's Marcel?<eos> In all his overstuffed down.<eos> Okay, Lilly.<eos> Stay and watch over them.<eos> I will.
To Asgard.<eos> He's convinced it's in East End.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, that door is locked.<eos> Forever.<eos> No one's going in or out.<eos> There've always been mortals trying to prove the myths are real.<eos> Don't even humor him.<eos> I'd just stay away from him as much as possible, if I were you.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Did you spend the night here?<eos> Three-Time never slept before. - He can't start now.<eos> - And you're drinking coffee.<eos> What are you, my obstetrician?<eos> It's herbal tea.<eos> If you wanna take a break, I can get someone...<eos> I'm not trusting this to some N.F.G.<eos> You wanna help? Pull up a chair.<eos> Yes. Yes, sure.<eos> Yeah, we will.
Well, at least we know where the chapter is.<eos> 13 gilded pages means 13 chapters.<eos> Let's hope Mosconi didn't write a foreword.<eos> If all Hagen wants is the chapter, then it's not about the value of the book.<eos> No.<eos> It's about the information on the pages.<eos> Moz, you can leave those pages blank.<eos> Nobody's going to see them.<eos> Uh, not soon. No.<eos> But eventually, they will.
Wait, hold on.<eos> In 1996, Reed spent three years with a foster family and their son, Ezra Barnes.<eos> He served three tours in Iraq. He's stateside now.<eos> 20 bucks says he was stationed at Camp Kirby.<eos> Pay the man.<eos> The Mayor's foster brother is assigned to a weapons convoy that carries SCAR 16s by truck.<eos> The convoy's scheduled to come through Starling City tonight.<eos> FN SCAR 16s are military assault weapons with grenade launchers.<eos> The man gets a hold of these, Oliver, it's game over.<eos> He won't.
I just wanted to run it by you.<eos> Well, what reason could you possibly have for wanting to do it at all?<eos> Because Scottie came to me and asked, and I think it's good business.<eos> Well, your idea of good business is different from mine, because we already took less money from Folsom Foods, and now you want us to take less money from Darby.<eos> Jessica, if we screw him over, he's gonna come back at us.<eos> It might not be tomorrow.<eos> It might not be six months from now, but he's gonna find a way.<eos> - You mean she'll find a way.<eos> - That's exactly what I mean.<eos> And maybe she will.
Yes.<eos> I'm aware of his condition.<eos> His condition...<eos> I want him moved to the best facility in the state.<eos> He gets the best care available.<eos> For the rest of his life.<eos> I can arrange that.<eos> I want to end up someplace near him, so he can visit.<eos> If you cooperate, he won't have to visit you in jail.<eos> Yeah, he will.
- Was she awful?<eos> - No.<eos> Were you awful, - and now you're so ashamed you can't even look at her?<eos> - No.<eos> Ooh, was it weird?<eos> Is she a man? Ooh.<eos> Secret penis.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Well, why don't you guys ever sleep together?<eos> We will!
She's ex-French intelligence.<eos> She now makes a handsome living selling secrets.<eos> Mostly of a technological nature.<eos> I really don't understand any of it but she's clearly stepping up on this one, trying to make a legacy for herself.<eos> She owns that nightclub.<eos> Last time I was there, we had a great deal of fun until she tried to strangle me with her stocking.<eos> I'll get a warrant by the time you get there.<eos> She won't talk and even if she did, what would you expect her to say?<eos> She may know Seth's location.<eos> She won't.
What's the most valuable thing in your office?<eos> My medal of valor.<eos> God, you are such a hero.<eos> All right, how about this?<eos> I will bet you that by midnight tonight, I can steal the medal of valor from your office.<eos> Why would I possibly agree to that?<eos> Because if I lose, I'll work the next five weekends, no overtime.<eos> And I won't tell anyone here about the time I saw you wearing short shorts outside of work.<eos> But if I win...<eos> You won't.
But I'd save you.<eos> And we could go to scotland and rule there.<eos> That's a...<eos> That's a very kind offer.<eos> I hope I never have to take you up on it.<eos> Natalia.<eos> Did anyone see you come in here?<eos> No.<eos> They never do.<eos> They never will.
Yeah.<eos> Did you have any luck?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Here's the, uh, DV-100.<eos> Just needs the offending party and signatures.<eos> I'll run it back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Want to tell me who it is that needs restraining?<eos> I need to know what you're doing, Tara.<eos> You will.
There are dangerous chemicals involved in the process.<eos> So I've noticed.<eos> When's the funeral?<eos> Day after tomorrow.<eos> I wanted to give her foster family a chance to change their minds about attending.<eos> Do you think they will?<eos> No.<eos> You can stay in the guest room.<eos> Till the service.<eos> I will.
People can change.<eos> Terrible... unspeakable things happen to all of us, but... that doesn't give anyone the right to destroy someone's life.<eos> Whatever happened to you, whatever the truth is, for 14 years, you let an innocent man believe that he killed the one thing that he cared about.<eos> The one person in his screwed-up universe that he genuinely loved like a daughter.<eos> You took his desire to protect and save you, and you perverted it.<eos> You twisted it.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You haven't changed, Darcy.<eos> You never will.
I know, mom.<eos> Miranda?<eos> What is that?<eos> Max likes to play hide and seek.<eos> Is she my sister?<eos> We found her playing in the yard.<eos> We don't know how she got here, but we're taking care of her. Hi.<eos> I'm Miranda.<eos> Max doesn't talk.<eos> But she will soon.
Please. Used to do this all the time.<eos> Is that an Eames chair?<eos> Why do bad guys always have such great style?<eos> Don't. Touch. Anything.<eos> I guess he wasn't as lucky as me.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I feel good.<eos> Funny, I thought I'd feel different.<eos> - Changed or something.<eos> - You will.
Maybe I can buy you a couple of minutes.<eos> Please.<eos> No.<eos> You have to come with us.<eos> He's coming with us.<eos> Prepare to fire.<eos> What is this, Gene?<eos> Where are they?<eos> Horn said he was gonna leave my daughter alone.<eos> And he will.
2,000 security cameras around New York City, license plate...<eos> In service of the public safety.<eos> Overkill.<eos> - Vigilant.<eos> - Time out.<eos> Uh, "Don't tell me where to stand"<eos> sounds like, uh, "You can't handle the truth."<eos> We don't want to sound patronizing.<eos> Well, she started it!<eos> And so will Reverend Potter on the broadcast.
What else would I do, exactly?<eos> - After my debt was paid?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> You think I still mean you harm?<eos> - Why would that be?<eos> - All I meant was...<eos> You don't pick your family or their faith.<eos> And it doesn't matter whose blood flows through your veins.<eos> You choose your own path.<eos> Or your King will.
No!<eos> Mike!<eos> Where's Coulson?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Coulson.<eos> We land in half an hour. Good.<eos> The sooner we begin, the better.<eos> Whatever this is, whatever you think you're doing, it won't work.<eos> I won't give you what you want.<eos> You will.
- How could you?<eos> - I killed them.<eos> I know.<eos> And even worse, everyone started blaming you.<eos> - I tried to stop them...<eos> - But you hurt more people.<eos> I was trying to protect you from them. I was trying to atone for my sin.<eos> Hannah, please. Maybe if you forgive me, I won't go to hell.<eos> Only God can forgive you.<eos> And he won't.
You don't need to deny it.<eos> That bastard humiliates you every chance he gets. He treats you with nothing but hate.<eos> I couldn't stand by and let him get away with it.<eos> I'm not gonna apologize for wanting him dead.<eos> But you gotta believe me. I... I never meant for an innocent man to die.<eos> Conrad put Father Paul in that car, not you.<eos> You tried to spare me from a monster.<eos> It was an act of pure selflessness, and one I will always cherish.<eos> Does Conrad know?<eos> No. He never will.
Freelance acquisitions.<eos> What kind of acquisitions?<eos> Fine.<eos> Stay put till I get back.<eos> Wait.<eos> Hey.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Do you see these people?<eos> They don't understand.<eos> Hopefully they never will.
He'll verify everything I'm telling you.<eos> Where are we on the contents of the box?<eos> Still working on those passports and tracing the money, but ballistics did confirm that it was the gun used to kill Victor Fokin.<eos> We actually did find a partial on one of the casings in the magazine.<eos> But it's not Tom Keen's and there were no hits on it through AFIS.<eos> Give me updates as soon as you have them.<eos> Meanwhile, there's been a development.<eos> Reddington's brought us a case.<eos> It's about time he realizes that he has to talk directly to us.<eos> He won't.
But he couldn't stop me.<eos> Your father's on his way.<eos> But of course you knew that.<eos> That's why you showed everyone your face.<eos> You wanted him to know that you'd won.<eos> And it worked.<eos> But you have to admit, what I've done is extraordinary.<eos> My father will never forget it.<eos> Certainly Dana won't.<eos> Or maybe she will. Will you?
Thank you.<eos> That was, like, our tenth gay guy tonight.<eos> Let's hope our gay buzz lasts longer than Adam Lambert's.<eos> Oh, it will.
No, it isn't.<eos> You.<eos> You first.<eos> Stay away from them.<eos> Well, how about this?<eos> The worm has teeth.<eos> What, you're here to pwotect your wuved ones?<eos> I'm not going to let you touch either one of them.<eos> Oh, and I'd like to see that.<eos> Oh, you will.
- What?<eos> - I was the one who ruined the cake.<eos> I was afraid that all those boys were gonna make fun of you.<eos> I think I care more about you fitting in than you do.<eos> No, I care.<eos> I care a lot.<eos> It's just the stuff I'm good at isn't the stuff that makes you popular.<eos> Contestants, all cakes must be... at the judges' table in 60 seconds.<eos> Ay. there's no way we're gonna make it through that crowd.<eos> Like heck we won't.
This is the necklace you gave me in Rome.<eos> I never stopped wearing it.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> You don't know what it means to hear you say that.<eos> Federal Agent Rossabi.<eos> I know that you've been colluding with Annie Walker.<eos> When I'm done you're gonna be back in a prison cell.<eos> Did you sanction a CIA black Ops team to torture Teo Braga with full knowledge that he was your husband's son?<eos> - Yes. - Did your husband know that?<eos> - He will now.
How you holding up?<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, I'm sorry I got you into this.<eos> No. You didn't.<eos> I asked to be a part of it.<eos> I'd just never thought it would get to this.<eos> The nurse. The limo driver.<eos> Now that kid, Boyd.<eos> Let's just hope it ends there.<eos> It won't.
Still.<eos> Ariadne?<eos> I see you've done the right thing.<eos> I know how hard this must have been for you, Ariadne.<eos> And Korinna?<eos> I shall see she is released.<eos> Oh, no. Come.<eos> Come here.<eos> It will get better.<eos> It will.
Oh. Okay.<eos> Happy to do it.<eos> Surprised, but happy.<eos> Uh, maybe I could change into one of those cute chef jackets.<eos> Oh, chef Nicholas only permits pastry chefs to wear these.<eos> But I can't meet everyone on my first day looking like this.<eos> I mean, it's already bad enough I'm the juice girl.<eos> I have some workout clothes you can wear. Don't worry.<eos> I haven't worn them yet.<eos> But I will someday.
Not gonna distract you.<eos> I'm just gonna go grab a bite.<eos> Do you want anything?<eos> I wanna move this stupid finger.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Try again? Whenever you're ready.<eos> Damn it!<eos> You put the sensors in weeks ago.<eos> I haven't moved the damn thing once.<eos> You will.
I'm a swan.<eos> And a surgeon... a freaking kick ass surgeon... who, by the way, has had sex before.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Does daddy know?<eos> You know what?<eos> You're fired as my bridesmaids, all three of you.<eos> I don't want a single one of you standing up for me at my wedding.<eos> Honey, don't be silly.<eos> You have to have bridesmaids.<eos> And I will.
We still have a boat ride to Nantucket ahead.<eos> You, uh, have her for a lifetime.<eos> You mind if I borrow her for 16 eight counts?<eos> Well, she's all yours.<eos> I hate to say it. You two do make a beautiful couple.<eos> And it's such a shame the bride only has a few hours to live.<eos> Did you handle the Patrick situation?<eos> He shut me down, in favor of staying glued to mommy drearest's side.<eos> Which is exactly why he can't get on that yacht.<eos> He won't.
A win and the Dodgers will have clinched the National League pennant Yankees having already clinched in the American League.<eos> There's bad blood here as Ostermueller beaned Robinson in the head earlier in the season prompting quite a rhubarb at the time.<eos> Teams have gone their separate ways since with Ostermueller left standing in the Dodgers' way as they chase the pennant that eluded them last year.<eos> Come on, Jackie, let's go!<eos> Here comes the pitch.<eos> And Robinson takes outside.<eos> Ball one.<eos> - Come on, Fritz, let's get this boy!<eos> - You don't belong here.<eos> And you never will.
Piece of shit.<eos> Okay. Here we go.<eos> Is this man dangerous?<eos> He shoots men down for a living.<eos> He's a stone-cold killer.<eos> My boss has half the city looking for him.<eos> Half the city and me, so...<eos> And if you find him, there's a hell of a price.<eos> Chunk of money like that, you should think on it.<eos> - I will.
Are you all right?<eos> I just...<eos> I wish I could've done something.<eos> Done something?<eos> Jack, you stood up to Pitch.<eos> You saved us! But Sandy...<eos> Would be proud of what you did.<eos> I don't know who you were in your past life. But in this life, you are Guardian.<eos> But how can I know who I am until I find out who I was?<eos> You will.
Understand?<eos> Look at me. Look at me, Daisy.<eos> Understand?<eos> I know you are intimate.<eos> I've known since the day it happened. What?<eos> Those things he said. He meant them. I know that.<eos> Cigarette?<eos> I need one.<eos> But I've accepted.<eos> Like you will.
I've come to retrieve my son's bicycle.<eos> I believe you assaulted him and...<eos> Mr. Whitman, are you still taking us to dinner?<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Thanks for getting my bike back.<eos> Think about Telluride this summer.<eos> Judy would love it if you were there.<eos> I mean, I would, too.<eos> Actually, so would your brother if he could distinguish shapes.<eos> I will.
- I have to go.<eos> Can I join?<eos> I wanted to apologize ... By the way ... how Ryan tried.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Do not worry.<eos> Just try to take care of you, you know that, do not you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Just wish sometimes couldst tell me things ... And ...'d let me help.<eos> Alright.<eos> I will.
They can do that, you know.<eos> And then out is gonna slide a little miracle.<eos> Half you, half her, your DNA all mixed together in one magical baby cocktail.<eos> The best day of your life.<eos> That's sweet, but Alex here is adopting.<eos> Yeah, do it that way.<eos> No fuss, no muss.<eos> Come on, Jordan!<eos> - What if he hates me?<eos> - He will.
I do not know, I think that there is a plan.<eos> He ​​is very confused<eos> - I know .. .<eos> We can not continue much longer<eos> - That is for sure.<eos> Is he...<eos> What do we do?<eos> We're running away.<eos> We should call the police.<eos> Yes, we will.
Okay, let's get you to a clinic. No, I can move.<eos> I can...<eos> Okay, you get this side.<eos> Okay. I can make it!<eos> I can make it I can make it.<eos> Don't get hung up on the hook here.<eos> Come on, boy.<eos> Come on. - Bring my dogs. - Come on.<eos> I got 'em. - Bring my dogs!<eos> - I will.
Hadn't been for Joseph, I couldn't have gone to medical school.<eos> I bet you wish your mom was dating a millionaire, huh?<eos> Not a millionaire, Russell, okay?<eos> Just someone who's making a living.<eos> I mean, Mom worked hard for that buyout money.<eos> She shouldn't have to support you with it.<eos> What happens if the Pigeon and the Truck doesn't make any money, huh?<eos> Do you actually know anyone who likes warm beer?<eos> It'll all work out.<eos> I'll Always.
Don't... (GRUNTS)<eos> Not so smart now, are you...<eos> Kathy.<eos> But you are so beautiful.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> Hello, sweetie.<eos> I'm just calling to see how you are getting along.<eos> Mom, I can't really talk right now.<eos> I gotta get up for work. Well, don't forget to ask for that raise.<eos> I will. (GROANS)
'Cause I'll fill you full of holes, pal.<eos> Now, there's a roadblock up ahead.<eos> You're gonna drive through it, just like you're one of them.<eos> Get to driving.<eos> Go back to the house.<eos> Talk to his wife.<eos> What am I looking for exactly?<eos> Just break her.<eos> -This will never work.<eos> -Course it will.
Of course, she really is our Shiksha.<eos> Do you know it is in these very hands that you were born?<eos> She looks exactly like Viju<eos> - I am...<eos> I am Ashatai.<eos> - She has come from a school.<eos> You remember, don't you?<eos> - Oh come on Ashatai!<eos> How will she know?<eos> Why won't she?
- I fell, and it hurts a lot.<eos> - Should we get the party started?<eos> - Mom will be so happy to see you.<eos> There's just a little thing you need know about Dad.<eos> What now?<eos> - I really should kick his ass.<eos> - Don't do that here.<eos> - It's your sister's party.<eos> - But when my arm is cured, I'll give him a...<eos> No, you won't!
Uh, Miss Watson's just having a bout of seasickness.<eos> Well, then she has my sympathy.<eos> It'll pass.<eos> There you are.<eos> I wondered where you'd got to.<eos> I felt like a breath of air.<eos> Theresa says we're like six little pigs packed into that cabin, all trussed and bound for market.<eos> We're six people bound for a new life.<eos> And we'll have plenty of air to breathe when we get there.<eos> We Will.
What risk?<eos> The sea's like a mill pond.<eos> Exactly.<eos> That means no foam at the base of a rock or an iceberg.<eos> And they've no binoculars in the crow's nest.<eos> I think it's damn stupid.<eos> I should watch whom you say that to, Mr Murdoch, or you'll find yourself in the brig.<eos> It's too late.<eos> He won't want to be bothered.<eos> Oh, yes, he will.
You're about to be questioned by a federal agency about piloting an airliner drunk.<eos> An airliner that crashed!<eos> And you continue to drink! And stumble around!<eos> What kind of crazy do you have to be to do that?<eos> I'm afraid of you.<eos> Okay, all right. Then let me stay with you.<eos> Let me stay with you. They're staking out all my houses anyway.<eos> I'll stay with you until, until...<eos> I won't leave the house.<eos> I won't.
And you continue to drink! And stumble around!<eos> What kind of crazy do you have to be to do that?<eos> I'm afraid of you.<eos> Okay, all right. Then let me stay with you.<eos> Let me stay with you. They're staking out all my houses anyway.<eos> I'll stay with you until, until...<eos> I won't leave the house.<eos> I won't.<eos> You cannot drink in my house. I won't.<eos> I won't. I won't.

He's Vietnamese.<eos> So, anyway, you said you wanted some sex in it, so I guess they're having sex.<eos> Desist, brother.<eos> You know this will not help us.<eos> He sniffs the air.<eos> He says the single word...<eos> Gasoline.<eos> The hooker, she studied Vietnamese at Yale.<eos> I don't smell gas.<eos> You will.
Feeling any better?<eos> Yes. Thanks a lot.<eos> Dr. Tapia's here.<eos> We'll be right back.<eos> Yes?<eos> Why didn't you pick up?<eos> I'm sorry, I thought the police might have your mobile.<eos> Nobody took my mobile. Everything's fine.<eos> Has she turned up?<eos> No, but she will.
I used to think that about Tessa.<eos> You're aware of her condition?<eos> Yeah, she's told me everything.<eos> No, she hasn't.<eos> If she wants you to find her attractive, then one thing she won't have done is told you everything.<eos> How old are you? Why?<eos> Because at your age, you shouldn't have to be nursing someone.<eos> Tessa doesn't need nursing.<eos> Yes, she does.<eos> And she will more and more.
I'm sorry.<eos> Good.<eos> Just feel.<eos> Robin, how does it feel?<eos> Don't lie.<eos> How does it feel?<eos> It doesn't feel like anything.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Because Alan doesn't yet know how to appreciate a woman.<eos> But he will.
You kill him the same way he killed Nathan.<eos> Deal was ten grand.<eos> You'll get it.<eos> Here, same time tomorrow.<eos> You have to go to the police.<eos> Mitch, you heard him.<eos> That man is unstable.<eos> What if he does it?<eos> What if people find out we knew?<eos> They won't.
Oh, that's a new one on me.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I can't tell you.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> My client specifically ordered me not to say.<eos> Well then, we have nothing to talk about.<eos> Well, that can't be the law.<eos> No, the law is clear:<eos> It assumes that a man on trial for murder will want to defend himself.<eos> And if he won't?
That's when Moxon gave me the list.<eos> Why me?<eos> There must be some connection between Sarah and the numbers, otherwise why give me the list?<eos> So Moxon was trying to blow the whistle about something?<eos> I think so.<eos> There is a link between Sarah and Noble.<eos> These guys chasing me did not want him to tell the truth.<eos> You have to talk to Sarah.<eos> She's your client and she's lying to you, Mitch.<eos> I will.
Surgeons don't have the luxury about being sorry about anything, Mary.<eos> I have enough useless twats in my class.<eos> I'm not gonna abide by one of my - promising students falling asleep.<eos> - I am so sorry. - I was up all night studying.<eos> - Uh-huh. That's what they all say.<eos> - I was suturing a turkey. - Uh-huh.<eos> Did you eat it afterwards?<eos> It wasn't an eating turkey.<eos> I see great potential in you, Mary, if you stop fucking up in my class.<eos> I will.
I'll hold you to that.<eos> It's personal.<eos> I embarrassed you, Tom. Sorry.<eos> No, Tony, it's OK.<eos> We were both going places once, weren't we?<eos> You got over your...bump in the road.<eos> Nightlight!<eos> Here, puss.<eos> I never got over mine.<eos> You will, Tony.
It's personal.<eos> I embarrassed you, Tom. Sorry.<eos> No, Tony, it's OK.<eos> We were both going places once, weren't we?<eos> You got over your...bump in the road.<eos> Nightlight!<eos> Here, puss.<eos> I never got over mine.<eos> You will, Tony.<eos> You will.
With the pumps at Andrews Air Force Base ... and other local near the Capitol ... is clear we are under attack.<eos> The president and his family were taken to a safe place.<eos> The Air Force 1 Andrews played ... pumps 3 minutes before explode there.<eos> If you see smoke for miles around Washington ... and more explosions can be imminent.<eos> Please stay away of roads and highways.<eos> The emergency vehicle need to go.<eos> Stay in your homes.<eos> We await the announcement the president.<eos> Once this occurs, going forward.<eos> Now, we will for Suzanne Gibbs on Capitol Hill.
She is a Borgia.<eos> I would have married as you bid.<eos> But if I had followed my heart-<eos> So, the future of this family is in thrall to your heart?<eos> You stand accused of defying papal orders to cease your heretical preaching.<eos> I will walk through this fire to show I speak God's truth!<eos> Savonarola's been disgraced.<eos> He's being hauled to Rome as we speak.<eos> Has he confessed?<eos> He will.
Forgive my appearance, Your Eminence.<eos> We have worked long hours without sleep and-<eos> I only care about your work, Signor Vittorio.<eos> The fate of all of us depends on it.<eos> This is true artistry.<eos> I'm pleased it pleases you,my lord.<eos> And there are-<eos> Ninety-five more like it making their way from other foundries as we speak.<eos> Perhaps our fragile illusion will yet have substance.<eos> It will,my Lord.
Let him sleep it off.<eos> Ah!<eos> Father.<eos> Father...<eos> Take your hands off me! The friar, Savonarola, he's been disgraced.<eos> The people of Florence celebrate.<eos> Ah!<eos> We greet this good news with caution.<eos> Has he confessed?<eos> He will.
I fear all the time she spent with my family might have ruined her.<eos> She was a bit of an original groupie.<eos> And were you her favorite?<eos> You mean, did I turn her. I think I did.<eos> But, no, wait.<eos> Maybe it was Rebekah.<eos> But there was also a Klaus period.<eos> And let's not forget the Elijah affair. I spoke to my brother.<eos> I know you're trying to find out who you descended from.<eos> Now you never will.
I haven't actually decided yet.<eos> Oh, sure you have.<eos> See, you've had every chance and every excuse imaginable to do it, but yet you haven't.<eos> Which means you don't want to.<eos> You know something, you're right.<eos> See, I'm still waiting for my old friend to come back.<eos> By the looks of it, he's just beneath the surface. Waiting to come out and play.<eos> Right, ripper?<eos> I've been fighting that part of myself. Thinking that if I repress it, it would go away.<eos> But it won't.
And we know for sure that at least some of the vics hooked up with strange women days before being killed Amazon style.<eos> Hooked up in the same bar I met Lydia, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And then suddenly, she's got a little baby in like fruit-fly time.<eos> That baby turns into a little girl just as fast.<eos> - So maybe you're --<eos> - Don't say it.<eos> Look, if that kid's yours --<eos> I said don't say it!<eos> Fine. I won't.
You got to do that again.<eos> That tickled.<eos> Dean, come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> - Charlie, talk to us.<eos> You okay?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why didn't you kill him?<eos> - 'Cause we can't yet.<eos> But we will.
Nuclear powers, grows every day.<eos> How many weddings have a bomb shelter contingency plan?<eos> The world couldn't wait one more week before exploding itself?<eos> Hello. Let's stick to happier subjects.<eos> How's the groom?<eos> He's an actor, so...<eos> A working actor but an actor nonetheless.<eos> Poor Abu keeps his heart medication close at hand.<eos> You know, if the war doesn't kill him...<eos> The wedding costs will.
Why not try?<eos> You don't think I've considered it?<eos> Mother would never allow it.<eos> Suren and I would have to disappear.<eos> Two suitcases, 2 train tickets and never look back and she--<eos> She's not ready to give this up.<eos> You wouldn't have to run.<eos> Stay on Mother's good side.<eos> We can have what they have.<eos> And in a thousand years, we will.
Well, when you left this morning, you forgot to turn off the scanner. And I overheard a conversation with two guys, and I could swear they were planning a crime.<eos> What did they say?<eos> Ugh, something about not wanting to go back to prison. You know, doing it right this time?<eos> Well, that's not your normal neighborly gossip.<eos> No, and whatever they're doing, it's gonna be on 47th and Park at noon.<eos> Look, it -- it could be nothing.<eos> Or it could be something.<eos> I'll look into it. Okay.<eos> Will you let me know?<eos> I will.
Even if you don't win, you're still my queen.<eos> I know, but this is so important to me, you know?<eos> I mean, this is probably the best thing that will ever happen to me.<eos> Honey, honey, honey, whoa.<eos> Hold on a second. The best thing that ever happened to you?<eos> See, that's crazy.<eos> You got your whole life ahead of you.<eos> You're gonna graduate and go to college and get out of this dumpy town.<eos> No, wade.<eos> I won't.
I just learned that "much" thing from the telly.<eos> Hey, here's a question.<eos> When are you going back to the ocean?<eos> Yeah. I mean, don't you have family back there?<eos> I used to, but not anymore.<eos> Um, the wife won't have me back.<eos> Threw me out, actually.<eos> Well, maybe you should talk to her.<eos> Peter, believe me. If she'd take me back, I'd go in a second.<eos> But she won't.
How are you gonna handle that?<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I guess we just, you know, we don't really talk about it.<eos> You should talk about it.<eos> You think so?<eos> I do.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I'm gonna get a coffee.<eos> (captain) Give her a kiss for me.<eos> - I will.
Do you think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?<eos> Stupider.<eos> The Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that.<eos> - Yeah, that's true, but you're still a girl. - I am not!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, pull your cock out and take a piss, then.<eos> I don't need to take a piss.<eos> Lommy and Hot Pie can't know.<eos> No one can know.<eos> Well, they won't. Not from me.
That should help his foot grow back.<eos> You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand.<eos> The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey.<eos> -You're going to kill Joffrey?<eos> -lf the gods give me strength.<eos> -And then what?<eos> -l don't know.<eos> We'll go back to Winterfell.<eos> I have no desire to sit on the iron Throne.<eos> So who will?
Get out!<eos> Do you want to see your girls again?<eos> Sansa, more beautiful than ever?<eos> And Arya, just as wild as ever?<eos> You have Arya, too? Both girls are healthy and safe. For now.<eos> But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey.<eos> I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer.<eos> Of course they will.
It's a longer story.<eos> What I can tell you, is that I know about your kind.<eos> Your kind...<eos> I can help.<eos> This...<eos> This is something different.<eos> W...<eos> Well, do you know what did it?<eos> No.<eos> But the Argents will.
Is there some ultimate end, or are we just into some sort of endless pursuit of nothing more than pleasure?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I believe there's meaning to it, to our lives.<eos> That's what I believe.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Like what?<eos> I haven't learned that answer yet.<eos> Well, keep up the good work until they shut you down, dude.<eos> They're not gonna shut me down, Van.<eos> Yeah, they will.
They are not to be trusted.<eos> And who is to be trusted?<eos> Who are my people?<eos> The Targaryens?<eos> I only knew one-- my brother, and he would have let 1,000 men rape me if it had got him the crown.<eos> The Dothraki?<eos> Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse.<eos> Your people are in Westeros.<eos> The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.<eos> - They will soon enough.
Brilliant!<eos> I knew you could...<eos> Oh, hey, there's the guys!<eos> So, we threw the fight, as ordered.<eos> After Artemis planted the tracer.<eos> Cheshire's heading North.<eos> Sportsmaster was headed South.<eos> Kinda like this mission.<eos> Maybe he'll double back.<eos> Maybe she will.
What were you doing in there anyhow?<eos> Not even home yet and you get yourself into a drunken fight, you shiftless fool.<eos> I'm hidin' out at the still till this ruckus with Jim Vance blows over.<eos> You'll drink yourself to death up there.<eos> I ain't going up there to die.<eos> I'm going up there to stay alive.<eos> Come home from the army, breeding' me like I was cattle, then you take off again?<eos> No, you've got your duties as a husband and father.<eos> Kids, mind your mama while I'm gone.<eos> We will.
They told us to wait out here.<eos> Okay.<eos> She's in room 803.<eos> Right.<eos> Oh, hey, um, I wanted to give you guys something.<eos> Uh, made this for the baby.<eos> Um, if you guys could give it to him at some point, you know, if you feel like it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you, Lip.<eos> Yeah, we will.
I could, if you charged me. Yeah?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm terrified.<eos> Yeah, well, you're the aggressor.<eos> Listen. I still think you're a fucking turd.<eos> But I'm sorry that I clocked you and I appreciate you taking Annie to L.A.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Oh, and we know who got the best of who in that scuffle.<eos> So, if you forgot, just ask your previous shirt.<eos> I will.
It's not a done deal yet.<eos> Uh, but, hey, you were awesome up there.<eos> You saved me from a company party downstairs that was a total snoozefest.<eos> Keep up the good work.<eos> You, too.<eos> Who was that? That was the founder of Nanovex.<eos> I've never heard of it.<eos> They make magnetically responsive nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery to tumor cells.<eos> I've still never heard of it.<eos> You will.
- Yes.<eos> He was here when I first woke up.<eos> - Was he?<eos> - Does he always talk so much?<eos> - He does, yes. - Ha! Ha!<eos> I like him, I think he's funny.<eos> Do you know he offered to get me a job<eos> - at his parents' restaurant?<eos> - Really? Don't tell him I said so, but... I can do better.<eos> I won't.
Love you.<eos> I don't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You said I would always be in your heart, and...<eos> That is too cruel a fate.<eos> Go live your life.<eos> Live it without me, because there is no place for us together.<eos> And fill your heart with love for someone else...<eos> Someone who can love you the way I never have.<eos> The way I never will.
And that man in the stables, you love him?<eos> With all my heart.<eos> Then you must marry him.<eos> I will go tell Father right away.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> You can't.<eos> Why not? Surely he'll understand.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But not everyone will.
And what's in it?<eos> Angora, perhaps?<eos> All I know is, we need to make our wool as soft, or see Kingsbridge ruined.<eos> Father, you're always exaggerating.<eos> Possibly. But as head of the Guild, it is my duty to engage in such problems.<eos> You'll find a way.<eos> How's Mother?<eos> Resting.<eos> It will take weeks for your letter to reach the Queen and hear if she will even accept your offer.<eos> She will.
Mom eats cheeseburgers and shrimp.<eos> We've had Christmas trees every year.<eos> Like most Jews.<eos> Maybe she did convert.<eos> - Botwin family?<eos> - Yes, right here, yes.<eos> - Is she alive? - Yes.<eos> However, she is in a coma, and...<eos> I won't pull the plug.<eos> I will.
Investigating date.'<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Well, if Pullbrook died after Reggie then his heirs get the money.<eos> If he died first, then I do.<eos> But that's absurd.<eos> What right have his heirs to inherit anything?<eos> Darling, what right have I?<eos> Frankly, what difference does it make?<eos> I shan't keep it if I get it.<eos> Well, actually, you will.
You understand that, don't you?<eos> This afternoon I thought: Why don't you move in with us?<eos> I don't want to push you, but... I thought: Why not?<eos> It's the same ambulance driver.<eos> I said you have to fight back.<eos> And I still believe that.<eos> I think you should always fight back.<eos> - Arie, how do you feel?<eos> When you say that, he may think: He's right.<eos> I will.
- You're OK, Tommy.<eos> See you Saturday.<eos> I bet you wouldn't even know how to kiss a girl.<eos> If you saw a girl's gash, you'd put a plaster on it.<eos> All right, man?<eos> - What have been saying about my party?<eos> Spreading the word.<eos> You have 32 friends already.<eos> I don't even know 32 people.<eos> - You will.
You could call the police, or Jason, and they'd lock her away forever."<eos> I decided to pull the trigger instead.<eos> I wanted to kill her.<eos> Does that sound like self-defense to you?<eos> - Give me some gloves.<eos> - By the sink.<eos> The Guardian wanted Nan followed to make sure she carried out his orders.<eos> I saw an opportunity to save Eric, so I took it.<eos> So nobody in the Authority knows about your relationship?<eos> And they never will.
Is something wrong?<eos> We're estranged.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought the four of you were inseparable.<eos> I know, but something happened a few months ago, and...<eos> Bree?<eos> After everything we've been through, I promise you can trust me.<eos> I don't want you to know.<eos> You're the only one who still believes in me.<eos> And I always will.
Oh, whatever!<eos> Look, this guy I'm seeing, it's -- it's nothing.<eos> I-it's just fun.<eos> Just fun.<eos> Dee Ann, are you sure this is a good idea?<eos> No. Probably not.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's just -- he's so different from Duke.<eos> What if it turns serious?<eos> It won't.
But I'm scared.<eos> These men are dangerous.<eos> I can't go back to them with nothing.<eos> Don't be scared.<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.<eos> Look... maybe there's a way we could help each other out.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, I could give you enough information... - ...to keep your bosses happy.<eos> - What if the other cops find out?<eos> They won't.
I really must go to sleep.<eos> Of course.<eos> You should have said.<eos> Have you ever read an atlas?<eos> What?<eos> Yes, I suppose I has...<eos> No but you've read an atlas.<eos> Actually sat down and read cover to cover.<eos> - No. - Ah!<eos> - We will.
- The hell is that'?<eos> - Years ago, Percy created Division. Oversight insisted he build in a failsafe.<eos> There's a tanker of VX gas tapped into Division's ventilation system.<eos> After Oversight pulls the trigger, the place will be a mass grave.<eos> - Why is Oversight doing this?<eos> - Division has become expendable.<eos> You're planning an escape, which we both know is impossible.<eos> There is no way out of here.<eos> No way that you can see.<eos> But you will.
- You can't paint over bloodstains.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> A few hours ago, you promised me another 50.<eos> Now, I hear I've been cutoff. Why the change?<eos> I imagine you already know that.<eos> Well, I'm sure Raylan Givens paid you a visit, and you just pussed out.<eos> Nothing to do with the fact that you've spent the last 20 years looking for a way to hang me out to dry.<eos> I asked you to deal with the marshal.<eos> You didn't deal with him.<eos> Now I will.
Oh. He has a full head of hair, owns his own home, and drives a red corvette.<eos> I'll share him with you.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> You sure?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> But wow.<eos> All right, you guys, it's been 20 minutes.<eos> We should just go in.<eos> Spencer hasn't texted yet.<eos> She will any minute.
Who knows what any one of us would have done in your situation?<eos> All looks good.<eos> I'm off.<eos> "I'm terrified, Niko.<eos> It was awful.<eos> What do you think it means?"<eos> Kate, can you do this? When you say it,<eos> - believe it.<eos> - I believe it.<eos> And so will he.
I didn't want to have to do this, but you leave me no other choice.<eos> What are you doing with mama's journal?<eos> You took that out of my room.<eos> There's some interesting stuff in there, Uncle Bobby.<eos> Did you know miss Ellie spent some time in a mental institution?<eos> That was after daddy died.<eos> She was having trouble accepting his loss!<eos> Save your breath, John Ross.<eos> There is nothing in mama's journal that will in any way overturn her will.<eos> Maybe it won't.
It's the right thing to do.<eos> Besides, I think I...<eos> Sided with the wrong half of your son's family in the first place.<eos> You have no idea how much I appreciate that.<eos> Well, it always feels good when I can turn from villain to hero in the blink of an eye.<eos> Now...<eos> I want to make a contribution to your campaign.<eos> A large one.<eos> I-I can't accept that.<eos> You will.
Previously on The Client List...<eos> Kyle left me, and I have no idea if he's ever coming back.<eos> Bobby just texted me, and he's thinking we should just look around here and get married.<eos> Well, whose are these, anyway?<eos> Dee Ann.<eos> Me?<eos> This guy I'm seeing -- it's just fun.<eos> What if it turns serious?<eos> It won't.
Malory, I've done some messed up shit working for you, but I am not, repeat not, chopping up a dead body!<eos> What!<eos> My God, do you want me to get the electric chair?<eos> !<eos> For a murder you both know I didn't commit?<eos> !<eos> Malory, I just can't.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Can't?<eos> Or won't.
Oh, man. This is it.<eos> You're bringing it.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> You're finally taking the big leap in front of the bus.<eos> Yeah, I'm thinking, uh...<eos> Yeah, maybe dinner tomorrow night, someplace quiet, romantic...<eos> Look, take it from me.<eos> The where doesn't matter as much as the who.<eos> - Well, if you need me...<eos> - I won't.
He just don't like secrets, unless of course they're his<eos> So you're not going to tell him but you're going to tell me, right?<eos> Oh, you know me better than that.<eos> Are these the men you saw'?<eos> - That's them. - Yeah.<eos> These are Turner's partners.<eos> From KPEK, the Norwegian firm that would manage the dam,<eos> No surprise then.<eos> - Stephen call you yet'?<eos> - Not yet, but he will.
I mean, dude, that's got to suck, right?<eos> You at least get what you came for?<eos> I don't --<eos> No.<eos> See, the correct answer to her question was "yes." "Yes, I need help."<eos> Cooper.<eos> Get in the car, sir.<eos> Get back in your vehicle.<eos> That's good.<eos> I will.
- Corinth is famous for its leather!<eos> - And of course... - Aaaaaaaaagh!<eos> The in-dash bar is to be stocked with non-alcoholic beverages only.<eos> Dodge cannot stress this enough.<eos> Never ever ever drink and drive.<eos> Now Sterling, listen to me.<eos> - It's like seeing the face of God...<eos> - Sterling! What?<eos> This car cost me a lot of money, so you have to take proper care of it.<eos> I will!
To rosa!<eos> - That girl's got no fear.<eos> - And I got no clue.<eos> I can't believe I doubted her.<eos> I was so pigheaded and close-minded and...<eos> Feel free to stop me when you disagree.<eos> You're starting to win me over.<eos> Go on. Corazon, I just wanted to believe that rosa...<eos> That you all still needed me.<eos> Papi, we always will.
Would you like to see it?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> You should.<eos> It's very interesting.<eos> You have a lot to look forward to.<eos> See.<eos> Venus is passing through your 11th House just now turning on your love light.<eos> You need to get your affairs in order.<eos> I'm not having an affairs.<eos> Well, you will soon.
You've seen the tests.<eos> All the prisoners who volunteered came out just fine.<eos> Okay let's do this, shall we?<eos> You should keep the sunglasses on for some time.<eos> I'm almost scared, I won't recognize your new face.<eos> Don't worry, it's perfectly reversible.<eos> I don't intend to stick with it.<eos> Not only will you look the part, you'll be the part.<eos> To the point I won't be able to tell the difference.<eos> - I will.
We're ready.<eos> You're ready to have a baby?<eos> We know how to use condoms.<eos> We put them on cucumbers in health class.<eos> First of all, putting them on cucumbers is just setting yourself up for disappointment.<eos> And besides, condoms don't always work, and guys don't always stay.<eos> Burt did, and Robert would, too.<eos> And we could have a happy family just like you two.<eos> Yeah, fine.<eos> Maybe you will.
Doctor Ming Tang has the highest security clearance.<eos> She's our ticket into the mainframe and disabling HEARPE.<eos> Now, I'm not a people person per se, but when you say "our ticket in", by that you mean...<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We need you here.<eos> - Alone?<eos> - I'll have your back.<eos> Oh, great. She has my back.<eos> Look, if things don't go as planned...<eos> It will.
Are we really that fucked?<eos> Look, all she knows is that you bought some gas.<eos> That's not a crime.<eos> Yeah, but buying gas to burn down a church to cover up the fact you killed Travis Marshall is.<eos> But she can't prove it.<eos> Yet.<eos> I need to know what else she has, what her next move is.<eos> If all she's got is that DVD, I can handle this.<eos> Is this ever gonna end?<eos> Yeah, it will.
- I didn't...<eos> - You didn't have the wallet.<eos> Did you go back up for it?<eos> - No.<eos> - You didn't.<eos> Who did?<eos> - There's no way--<eos> - Meredith, he was your father.<eos> You probably both said a whole lot of mean things to each other, but you loved him and he loved you.<eos> More than Otis ever will.
Devil take the hindmost<eos> Our Christine shall choose tonight Let her choose<eos> Is she yours or mine?<eos> Draw the line<eos> If she sings, you lose tonight I won't lose<eos> You leave from here?<eos> Fine<eos> Disappear?<eos> Fine<eos> And if she won't?
You kids jazzed about dinner?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Oh, very jazzed.<eos> Yum. Well, call me Miles Davis, 'cause I'm jazzed.<eos> I'll give you 10 bucks to stab me in the face right now.<eos> Hey.<eos> Now I know why you were trying so hard to keep her here.<eos> If Cristina were staying, you'd be taking that job.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> No, no, Owen, you won't.
You still think I'm using you.<eos> To get to Evans?<eos> I don't care if you are.<eos> We don't know where he is.<eos> So the best way to stop him is to rescue his family.<eos> Except you don't know where they are, either.<eos> Yeah, you got me there.<eos> Why didn't they send you after Knox?<eos> He's our key target.<eos> Maybe they will.
Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with Quinn and keep this secret?<eos> I mean, she's gonna find out.<eos> Quinn's not gonna find out because I've destroyed every piece of evidence that you and I were ever a couple.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> You couldn't have gotten rid of all of it.<eos> You replaced me with a tiger.<eos> I couldn't completely get you out of that one.<eos> Had to get creative.<eos> Well, I'm glad that deleting our entire time together was so easy for you. But I guarantee you: Quinn is gonna find out eventually.<eos> No, she won't.
Okay.<eos> It's been an hour.<eos> When are we pulling the plug on "Candid Camera"?<eos> As a spy, your job is often to get people to break the rules.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's him. Here we go.<eos> You use their greed, their fear, or their rage to make them betray the things they value most.<eos> With a professional spy pushing them hard, most people abandon their principles.<eos> What the hell is all this?<eos> But sometimes, very occasionally, they won't.
We're on our way now.<eos> That's not much time.<eos> Come on, man, you're CIA; you don't need time.<eos> You keep us alive.<eos> We'll see what we can do.<eos> What happens if we can't get him out?<eos> Let black kill him.<eos> Go to plan "B."<eos> We don't have a plan "B."<eos> We will.
Go back inside.<eos> Hey, come on now, guys, huh?<eos> Look around.<eos> I don't think we want to be doing this for an audience.<eos> You made a big mistake, pendejo.<eos> This whore shit all over our club.<eos> Got my mom locked up.<eos> This is our get.<eos> We got to send a message, make sure the other pussy thinks about doing it.<eos> I will.
Nana, give me the keys to the scooter.<eos> Nana, I'm getting late.<eos> Give me the keys.<eos> Please, Nana.<eos> Give it.<eos> First apologise to Dilbar and Janemann.<eos> Don't act too smart.<eos> I won't give it. - Give me the keys.<eos> Useless, dog.<eos> - l won't.
That's beautiful.<eos> And in your case, it's bullshit.<eos> There are not words ugly enough to describe what Kyle did to you and the kids.<eos> To walk out that door and leave you to fend for yourselves without so much as saying a word or giving you a clue?<eos> Okay, well, maybe he did give me clues, and I didn't see --<eos> Don't, don't. Don't you dare make excuses for Kyle Parks.<eos> You are way past that.<eos> I know.<eos> So, snap out of it, girl.<eos> I will.
Open the door.<eos> Katie.<eos> You're late.<eos> Are you sure you want to do this?<eos> I have to.<eos> I am going to kill him.<eos> You said they would call.<eos> D.B.?<eos> You said they'd call.<eos> They will.
You got a thing for mommy.<eos> And now it all makes sense.<eos> Because I actually looked into your mommy, and it turns out that the whole time you were home with daddy, mommy was out banging--<eos> Point, Tanner.<eos> I'll see you in court, Harv.<eos> So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?<eos> He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.<eos> That's funny.<eos> But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.<eos> - It won't.
- What about Chow at the warehouse?<eos> Didn't you have to shoot him through the hand?<eos> - Think that didn't stick in his memory?<eos> - What about Dennis at the laundry?<eos> - They're sure to pick him up. - They already have.<eos> They picked him up last night.<eos> My guys are solid.<eos> I vetted them with great care and Fring made sure they were well compensated in the event of a situation such as this.<eos> They're paid to stand up to the heat keep their mouths shut, no matter what.<eos> And they will.
No.<eos> No way Mike would ever flip, okay?<eos> No way.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Never say never.<eos> This is the second time the DEA has confiscated his bankroll.<eos> You know?<eos> Jesus, fool me once, right?<eos> Look, he won't flip.<eos> But his nine guys will.
Different than who?<eos> Or is "different" code for "young"? No.<eos> I...<eos> I don't have a problem with his age.<eos> Mom, did you tell him yours?<eos> We've been very honest with each other. Okay.<eos> Well...<eos> It's a good start, I guess. We'll talk.<eos> We'll talk after school.<eos> We'll... hmm.
I'm gonna behave in class.<eos> I'm gonna read books instead of watch too much TV.<eos> And I'll eat green beans.<eos> I promise.<eos> I love you, mom.<eos> I love you, too, Mason.<eos> Coop.<eos> Mase, let's, uh, let your mom rest now.<eos> If you see Nana, say hi, okay?<eos> I will, baby.
Hey, stay away from him!<eos> Well, we anticipate that Somers' attorney will try and paint you as blinded by grief or looking to make a buck.<eos> This isn't about the money.<eos> I just want justice for my father.<eos> Emily, there are a lot of people who don't want this trial to proceed.<eos> Dangerous people.<eos> My mother died when I was a baby, and my father has been the only family I've ever known and they slit his throat.<eos> They are going to have to kill me if they want me to give this up.<eos> Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> And it won't.
- On purpose?<eos> - This is so dramatic.<eos> Do you guys remember One life to live?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Look, be pissed. Hate me.<eos> Do what you gotta do.<eos> But we got bigger fish, okay?<eos> We trade him in, we get outta here.<eos> - Won't matter.<eos> - Yes, it will.
Years later, this report came out that Roosevelt might have known Pearl Harbor was coming and let it happen.<eos> That rattled around in my head for days.<eos> How horrible it would be if it were true.<eos> Then again, it's what got us into the war.<eos> A lot of men died.<eos> But in the end it saved millions.<eos> I bounced back and forth like that until I realized it was too big for me to judge.<eos> He was too big.<eos> I still don't see what that has to do with Batman.<eos> Maybe one day, you will.
Hey, listen.<eos> My guys-- they found the Escalade.<eos> And the dude is there.<eos> Go.<eos> I'll get her home.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I didn't know anybody was in here.<eos> Otto, huh?<eos> We're gonna have to say something to each other - sooner or later.<eos> - No, we won't.
Daddy!<eos> What are you doing with him?<eos> Just saying hi, as friends.<eos> Tara knows.<eos> I'm gonna take him back to day care.<eos> You meet me outside.<eos> - Jax, I know you...<eos> - We'll do this outside.<eos> We should get Tara and the boys back to TM.<eos> We will.
All right, how do you do that?<eos> I mean, you were so excited about dinner last night, and you have every right to be angry, and instead, you make me breakfast.<eos> Did you know that Brett's not close with his family?<eos> I guess.<eos> You live at home with me.<eos> I'm lucky.<eos> I live at home 'cause I have massive student loans.<eos> I like him.<eos> In case you were wondering, I think he'd make a nice addition to the family.<eos> And maybe one day, he will.
I give this to children!<eos> Only if you want to saw off their legs!<eos> - I'm in so much pain!<eos> - Then suffer!<eos> Because this, is far worse.<eos> it will take you ... to a lush meadow with the high summer where you lie in the soft grass, and bask in the sun.<eos> And feel nothing but bliss.<eos> And you will never want to return to this frozen pisshole in the snow.<eos> I have to get out of here.<eos> It will never this good again.
The flash drive's at my apartment.<eos> I can pick it up.<eos> I want you to remove yourself from the case.<eos> Got nothing of note from Josh Avery's cell phone.<eos> Let's see if Samantha got anything that she might have recorded from his landline.<eos> Just take a minute to download.<eos> I haven't heard anything from the adoption agency.<eos> That's not a good sign.<eos> Listen, it'll all work out.<eos> It will.
Do you understand? I understand. Are you too scared, or do you...<eos> I need to know if it isn't that you're too scared.<eos> Or do you not believe what's right in front of your eyes?<eos> I really don't think that Jim's mind is capable of accepting that the world doesn't work the way that, you know, he was always told it works.<eos> You know, okay, all right, for a minute, let's say that Aaron is right, okay?<eos> Let's say they're all right.<eos> It's all true.<eos> That there are these people that secretly run things.<eos> Then they've always run things, okay?<eos> And they always will!
You're still too small to be of much help.<eos> There has to be something we can do.<eos> Well, unless you think you can find El Dara, all we can do is tighten our belts.<eos> Are you sure we're doing the right thing?<eos> We're no help to the family here, and if we leave, there will be 2 less mouths to feed.<eos> But ma will...<eos> Will thank us once we find El Dara.<eos> We'll bring back enough riches for all of us.<eos> But we don't even know where it is.<eos> Someone in thundera will.
Surgery?<eos> What are you-- oh, my God.<eos> I know.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Whose--whose leg is that?<eos> She didn't survive the transplant.<eos> But you did.<eos> I can't...<eos> I can't move it.<eos> You will, in a few days.
Alpha, beta, omega?<eos> That's right. It's a spiral.<eos> Reminds us that we can all rise to one or fall to another.<eos> Betas can become alphas, but alphas can also fall to betas or even omegas.<eos> Like Scott?<eos> Scott's with us.<eos> Really?<eos> Then where is he now?<eos> He's looking for Jackson. Don't worry, he's not gonna have it easy tonight either.<eos> None of us will.
You know me better than that.<eos> Are these the men you saw?<eos> That's them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> These are Turner's partners.<eos> From KPEK, the Norwegian firm that would manage the dam.<eos> No surprise, then.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Stephen call you yet?<eos> Not yet, but he will.
I don't have any more to keep.<eos> Well, then I'll be back in the morning.<eos> Hey.<eos> I have something to say.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna say it, and you're gonna listen.<eos> How can you do this to Violet?<eos> I mean, what kind of person would leave a little boy parentless, out in the street?<eos> For crying out loud, Cooper.<eos> Of course we'll take Lucas if something happens to Violet.<eos> We will?
This unsub went to a lot of trouble to make sure that the victim was placed right here in the middle of the room.<eos> That is significant.<eos> The unsub knows this place.<eos> Could be a former patient.<eos> I'll have Garcia pull up a list.<eos> We, uh, photographed all the walls, and we're running a paint analysis to find the most recent graffiti.<eos> Maybe a tagger saw something... or the unsub left his mark.<eos> My son. You've been so brave.<eos> I have no fear.<eos> You will.
Oh, my God, it's so good to see you.<eos> Great. Yeah.<eos> Havasu. '99. I was on the boat, remember?<eos> No. We were just...<eos> We were part... Yeah.<eos> I...<eos> - Winter Olympics. Uh-huh. - No.<eos> 2006. Bobsled.<eos> Sarah, I know that you think you're in love with me right now, but I promise you, you're going to find someone better. No!<eos> No, I never will.
WHEN AM I GOING TO SEE YOU AGAIN?<eos> I DON'T KNOW.<eos> BEFORE LONG.<eos> - I HAVE TO GO TO WORK NOW, ANGEL.<eos> - OK.<eos> - HOW MUCH DOES DADDY LOVE YOU?<eos> - ALL THE WAY TO HAWAII.<eos> AND BACK.<eos> TELL MOMMY I SAID HI.<eos> I WILL, DADDY.
YOU DO KNOW THAT?<eos> TURNER NEEDS A TECHNICAL PARTNER.<eos> TURNER ALREADY KILLED HOLM AND HIS WIFE.<eos> DO YOU THINK HE'D HESITATE TO KILL YOU?<eos> YOU SEE, YOU KNOW TOO MUCH.<eos> AND YOU'VE ALREADY SIGNED WHERE LARS HOLM REFUSED.<eos> I BEGGED LARS TO CHANGE HIS MIND.<eos> BUT I NEVER THOUGHT TURNER WOULD HURT HIM... NEVER.<eos> I BELIEVE YOU.<eos> NO-ONE ELSE WILL.
- Or somebody else.<eos> - Got it.<eos> She was waiting for me to tell her that I had figured out... how Pelant framed her for the murder of Ethan Sawyer.<eos> Which I have not been able to do yet.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what you're gonna do.<eos> You're gonna go to the next grave on your list, and you're gonna leave a ï¬‚ower that says, â€œSurrender yourself to the F.B.l.â€<eos> - I can't do that.<eos> - Then I will arrest you.<eos> Oh, cut that out now.<eos> You will not.
Excuse me. Hello.<eos> Is this the Post?<eos> Wait!<eos> I work with Peter.<eos> I set up a shell corporation.<eos> We steer a little bit of his paycheck into a quiet little slush fund.<eos> He can do whatever he wants with it.<eos> And if he were using this slush fund to binge on his favorite bad habit, where do you suppose we might find him?<eos> I rented an apartment in Tribeca under the name of the dummy corp.<eos> Yes, I will!

Shut your beak and fly.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Then let the challenge commence.<eos> That looks fast.<eos> I assume you are a cat of your word.<eos> When your brother loses, I expect the other stones.<eos> He won't lose.<eos> You better not lose.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He won't.
Yeah.<eos> Don't let 'em push you around.<eos> You take it easy.<eos> I'm sorry, everyone.<eos> We lost the debate.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We've got about an hour to air. Let's put it together.<eos> He'll cave.<eos> He'll agree to the debate on their terms.<eos> - No, he won't.
What Propecia?<eos> Your Pro--<eos> Is that not something that we're...<eos> So, uh, what you got going on today?<eos> Ohh. Busy, busy, busy, busy.<eos> I might buy some light bulbs, and then, if time permits, I might do a little work on my master project.<eos> - Top secret.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - So don't you dare ask what it is.<eos> - I won't.
No.<eos> I don't want her involved in this, Moz.<eos> What if she's willing to help?<eos> You talked to her?<eos> She's worried about you.<eos> And I'm sure she'll give Peter a glowing recommendation.<eos> Neal, this plan sounds incredibly intricate.<eos> It is.<eos> What happens if it doesn't work?<eos> It will.
I didn't want Sloan... dead.<eos> I wanted him... disbarred, unemployed, homeless.<eos> But you were there.<eos> You had motive.<eos> I peeked in the window, and then I left.<eos> Where'd you go? I went to work.<eos> I'm a blackjack dealer at the Tangiers, graveyard shift.<eos> I checked in at midnight and finished my shift at 8:00.<eos> You can check surveillance.<eos> I will.
Do you have a boat, some way off the island?<eos> There are boats, but... Get yourself off this rock.<eos> This whole place just became the biggest bull's-eye on the planet.<eos> I'm sorry. It's just...<eos> This whole island is a volcano.<eos> The stories we heard as kids, they were about lands plucked from the bottom of the ocean by a giant fish hook or tossed down from the sky by angry gods.<eos> Telling an islander they're going to die violently is just reminding us we're home.<eos> Shower's $10.<eos> Didn't ask.<eos> You will.
As crazy as it sounds, the man did save my life.<eos> Besides, someone has to make sure that he doesn't double back and give the 2nd Mass more grief.<eos> The man's a danger to himself and to everyone around him.<eos> Are you sure that's where you wanna be?<eos> No, but that's where I'm going.<eos> - You'll be missed, Anthony.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> - Take care of your boys.<eos> - Yeah. - Keep your eye on Pope.<eos> - Yeah, I will.
All right.<eos> Now you're a real Mason.<eos> That's it?<eos> Just gonna take off without saying goodbye?<eos> Figured you'd try and stop me.<eos> I want to.<eos> With all my heart and soul, I want to, but I don't know how to.<eos> It's for the best. You have to believe that.<eos> Never.<eos> I never will.
His Lordship's in trouble.<eos> - It seems they may have to sell.<eos> - What?<eos> Sell Downton?<eos> Well, that makes me sad.<eos> I wouldn't have thought there was much that could touch me in here, but that does.<eos> It's never come.<eos> They promised and promised, and I thought it was sure to be on the seven o'clock. But it's not.<eos> Well, I'll just have to wear black tie.<eos> But Lady Mary, she'll...
Which you did.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Must have known you'd have people watching the place.<eos> My parole officer knows where I'm staying.<eos> I knew I would be arrested within minutes, so why go back?<eos> Because I have just as much incentive to figure out who set that fire as you do.<eos> Someone clearly wants to frame me, someone who has waited a long time for me to get out, but would prefer that I stay caged up in that cell.<eos> And you might know who that someone is?<eos> I'm offering my services.<eos> As a... arson investigator... if you will.
Then she could have a yard and she doesn't...<eos> Have to be inside all the time.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Do we have a plan yet? Do we?<eos> We are waiting for the infection to improve, and then we will know what options we have.<eos> Well, if the vancomycin isn't working, then put me on colistin. It'll be stronger. - I understand that it's hard to just...<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> You don't, because you know what your life is going to be.<eos> You know if you're going to... Take her to the park. Or if you're gonna stand at an OR table again.<eos> Of course you will.
This is the beginning of a whole new era.<eos> All you need to do is trust me with your entire soul, and I promise you that everything will work out.<eos> Who killed her?<eos> Did you see him?<eos> He was tall.<eos> He had a beard and a brown jacket.<eos> First, he slashed my brother and sister's throats, then he stabbed my mother in the back.<eos> I tried to stop him, but he said he would kill me, too, if I moved a muscle.<eos> You're trying not to scream.<eos> But you will.
Yes, but you must keep Tom out of prison.<eos> I'll go to London today.<eos> I'll arrange an interview.<eos> I won't come home till I've seen Short.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I know it's right.<eos> For him. And for Sybil and this family.<eos> I suppose so.<eos> Let me know if Sybil gets in touch.<eos> She won't.
His grandfather was a farmer.<eos> In a small way.<eos> Which means he has more practical experience than Jarvis ever had.<eos> Think of the child.<eos> You cannot want your only granddaughter to grow up in a garage with that drunken gorilla?<eos> Don't we owe this to Sybil?<eos> I'll do it on one condition.<eos> No, two.<eos> First, Matthew must agree.<eos> He will.
I thought we just wanted him to have a reference so he could find work when he leaves.<eos> I know, but now that I think about it, Carson ought to insist that he stays on.<eos> He needs to re-establish his authority over James.<eos> Couldn't Mr Barrow just stay till after the match and then go?<eos> That seems rather unkind.<eos> Wouldn't we be using him?<eos> He might not want to stay, my lord, after the unpleasantness.<eos> I think he will.<eos> But don't forget the cricket.<eos> I won't, my lord.
I'll come for you at five.<eos> Know what you're going to wear?<eos> Nothing good, that's for sure.<eos> I'll keep an eye on the place.<eos> Oh, don't say you're not coming.<eos> I-I thought you could drive us.<eos> There is no need for impertinence, Edna, thank you.<eos> You're all right. I'm happy to drive them.<eos> But who'll stay here?<eos> I will.
I...<eos> Whatever happened to the magic lantern show?<eos> Oh, well, my brother and I manage the pleasure house now.<eos> And we're partners in the saloon.<eos> I took in a... Magic lantern show in Chicago.<eos> Two men caught a tiger under a barrel.<eos> Great story.<eos> The two young men were devoured by the tiger.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Sir, I will.
Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You recognize this, right?<eos> You're gonna help me put it together.<eos> You do not have use for it.<eos> Oh, but I do have a use for it.<eos> I just need to know how it fits together, and I need to know what powers it, and I need to know how it works.<eos> To do that... I need to turn it on.<eos> You must understand your compatriots have gleaned no information from me.<eos> You will not either.
Yeah.<eos> See, that's a "c" word.<eos> I've been through this routine before, doc.<eos> I really think we should just leave that one alone.<eos> You need a C.T. scan.<eos> Yeah, that's not gonna happen.<eos> Todd...<eos> Seriously, just-just drop it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
- Chester Mills.<eos> - And what's your address, Chester?<eos> 202 westbridge drive.<eos> Hey, no, no, no, no, no...<eos> Aah!<eos> - Oh, that... ohh!<eos> - Chester?<eos> (strained voice) It hurts. My stomach hurts so bad!<eos> Morphine's not working.<eos> - It will, Chester.
We got you together because you're the only people we know we can trust.<eos> When we discovered the skinwalker was stealing parts of women's faces, we started a computer program to piece together what it would look like if the parts were assembled.<eos> Now that we just got the final I.D. Of the woman buried near the cannery...<eos> We can finally get a picture of who the skinwalker's been building.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Um... why isn't Claire here for this?<eos> Claire...<eos> Claire's dead.<eos> The skinwalker took her. We've gotta get that son of a bitch.<eos> We will.
Hine...<eos> Mordred?<eos> Arthur...<eos> Ic the thurhaele thinu licsar.<eos> Emrys.<eos> Lie still.<eos> Much blood has been shed this day and all for something few wise men would ever want.<eos> You mean the Diamair?<eos> Morgana never found it?<eos> And she never will.
They go to the cops, we go to prison.<eos> Do you want to go to prison?<eos> Just give me the little bird, and we're gone.<eos> We don't want anything to do with the rest...<eos> How about you sit down?<eos> Yeah, no way you're taking leggy.<eos> This isn't about the bird, Skeezer!<eos> Stop acting all gangsta, dude.<eos> You're not going to kill anybody.<eos> Maybe I will.
No, Ma'am.<eos> Only it is unusual that a lady buy the same hat in three colours. I know what I am doing.<eos> I will write up your order, Ma'am.<eos> I have a notion, Miss Audrey.<eos> Is it good? I think it might be rather marvellous.<eos> Miss Paradise Pink.<eos> Oh, Miss Paradise Pink. Yes, that is marvellous, Mr Moray, sir.<eos> What is it?<eos> I will make an award for the most attractive lady wearing one of our pink flowers.<eos> Especially in your hands it will. Oh?
I was.<eos> I wanted to serve my country.<eos> Now you got crack pots hijacking airplanes, you got college students calling us vets "baby killers,"<eos> and it just feels like... it feels like the world is being turned upside down, doesn't it?<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Steve, what if I were to tell you that you could help bring D.B. Cooper to justice?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What I mean is, how would you like a job?<eos> And that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office, so help me God.<eos> That I will well...
It's a clue, right?<eos> Scandinavia.<eos> Reindeer.<eos> Reindeer, Christmas.<eos> I might have just figured out that the killer has a December birthday. Hmm.<eos> Did the couple you met kinda look like them?<eos> You must have walked by them on your way to the backyard.<eos> Classic.<eos> Still waiting for the subconscious clues to kick in, Jane.<eos> They will.
- 1,300.<eos> You hear that?<eos> She always moans a little at 1,300 feet.<eos> That's her G-spot.<eos> Destroyer still approaching aft.<eos> - Deeper.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> You going for the record, Captain?<eos> Oh, she'll take it.<eos> Yes, she will.
Nick.<eos> Cynthia.<eos> Sorry. I'm behind a lot of Xanax here.<eos> That's okay.<eos> You want me to see you to your seat?<eos> Please.<eos> Hello, Finn.<eos> Hi, Mr. Brody.<eos> - Tell Dana I say hi.<eos> - I will.
We came so close.<eos> It can still happen. One day.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I'm gonna clear your name, Brody.<eos> Carrie.<eos> You got me here.<eos> That's more than you ever had to do.<eos> Hey, you're talking in the past tense.<eos> Whatever happens or doesn't-<eos> It will.
- So who wants to try it?<eos> - I do!<eos> - Toss me the Tpod.<eos> - The Tpod?<eos> Turtle. Pod.<eos> Tpod.<eos> I am so good at naming stuff.<eos> You're really gonna plug an advanced piece of military technology directly into Mikey's head?<eos> What if it melts his brain?<eos> It won't.
I can stop calling.<eos> I can stop asking.<eos> But you never tell me to stop.<eos> Edison?<eos> Yes?<eos> I don't want you to stop.<eos> I want you to keep asking.<eos> But I'm not ready to say yes.<eos> Will you tell me when you're ready?<eos> I will.
Your friend at the Pentagon identified him?<eos> No. I spent the day going to homeless shelters.<eos> Turns out a lot of the guys from Desert Storm... ended up going to the one on Carlton Street.<eos> They kept his effects for over 10 years?<eos> The woman who runs the place, she believed that these guys would come back and have a normal life.<eos> Have you contacted his wife?<eos> I'm gonna see her tomorrow morning.<eos> She hasn't seen him in over 15 years.<eos> I need to know what happened to him, Bones.<eos> You will, Booth.
Don't be crass.<eos> You're skulking.<eos> Women of your generation are graceless.<eos> It's an affront to nature.<eos> Mediocre surgeons will see you and feel themselves wilting in your shadow.<eos> Do not shrink to console them.<eos> Do not look for friends here.<eos> You won't find them.<eos> None of these people have the capacity to understand you.<eos> They never will.
But I am hardly as ordinary as you.<eos> If I swoop in and claim the glory that is rightly mine, who benefits?<eos> Well, then tell me, and I'll report it!<eos> Great minds think alike.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> This was our place.<eos> - You have a problem, program? No!<eos> No problem. We're on our way out.<eos> - Don't come back.<eos> - I won't.
I got your girl!<eos> Are you watching?<eos> I want you to see this.<eos> You think that I'd let you live after everything you've done?<eos> Castle!<eos> Come on. I want you to watch.<eos> I want you to watch as I take her life.<eos> Over here.<eos> They still haven't found the body.<eos> They won't.
Well, at least now everyone can see the truth about them.<eos> They can see everything about them.<eos> But I have to say, I didn't expect this from Humphrey.<eos> And though I always wanted you to choose me, I always feared he was the better man.<eos> No one's better for me than you.<eos> Then you won't mind waiting a little longer for us to be together?<eos> Your plan to have Lily help you didn't work?<eos> My father has her wrapped around his finger.<eos> I have to find a way to expose him on my own.<eos> You will.
We now have no nuclear launch capabilities.<eos> If the plan was to steal the key, then how come we're still alive?<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> We are defenseless without our firing key.<eos> Maybe they want to make us sweat.<eos> Maybe they're on the way here.<eos> Maybe their plan was to extract their men first.<eos> Either way, we have to find the key.<eos> You should get that taken care of.<eos> I will.
What's the butterfly?<eos> I don't talk about that one.<eos> Some memories I like to keep for myself.<eos> Or maybe I used to catch bugs as a kid.<eos> Who knows?<eos> My memory's shot.<eos> Right.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Try and stay out of trouble.<eos> I will.
No... but he is.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> Sam Hanna. Been a while.<eos> G, meet Michael Snyder, CIA.<eos> Agent G. Callen.<eos> He also worked on the task force with Turner and me.<eos> I never liked him.<eos> Something tells me he doesn't like you, either.<eos> Some things never change.<eos> And never will.
So he's a psychopath who thinks he's a kid again and wants to avenge his father's death.<eos> If the robbery that killed the father happened in the theater...<eos> He's reenacting that moment.<eos> Give me your money.<eos> Give it now.<eos> I don't have any money.<eos> You're lying.<eos> I saw you with it.<eos> Dad, just give him the money.<eos> I won't.
He's reenacting that moment.<eos> Give me your money.<eos> Give it now.<eos> I don't have any money.<eos> You're lying.<eos> I saw you with it.<eos> Dad, just give him the money.<eos> I won't.<eos> Dad, just give him the money.<eos> I won't.
We need that boy.<eos> I can't thank you enough... especially you, Astrid.<eos> You put your life on the line for us, and I'll never forget that.<eos> I'm going to miss you. Both of you.<eos> Uh, who knows?<eos> Maybe we'll see each other again sometime.<eos> - Maybe we will.<eos> - Just promise me one thing...<eos> If you need help again, you'll ask.<eos> I will.
The blade's point is travelling inexorably toward his heart.<eos> Not even you could hope to thwart such magic.<eos> It would take a power as ancient as the dragons themselves.<eos> No.<eos> There must be something that we can do, Gaius.<eos> Only the Sidhe possess such magic.<eos> In the midst of the Lake of Avalon there is an ancient isle.<eos> That is the source of their power. You must take him there.<eos> He won't allow that.<eos> He will.
Well, I guess we just didn't have the nerve to come back and tell you we failed.<eos> You didn't fail!<eos> Look at our new home!<eos> New home?<eos> Who paid for all this?<eos> You did!<eos> The kid's right.<eos> The money's coming out of your pocket.<eos> Sorry, slick, but we don't have that kind of dough.<eos> Oh, you will.
Help Gwen's friend with his fish.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I got no idea.<eos> First time.<eos> - Branzino.<eos> - George.<eos> - Tell us about your day.<eos> - Did you catch that spider guy yet?<eos> No, we didn't catch him yet.<eos> But we will.
Whatever, dude.<eos> You and your puking truth!<eos> You are nothing!<eos> You know nothing!<eos> Doubter!<eos> Cherish your doubts, Michael.<eos> Jesus, lover of my soul.<eos> This is lovely, isn't it?<eos> Oh, I will never leave you.<eos> I will never.
Chris was so lucky to have such a loving mother like you.<eos> Aw, that is so sweet of you to say.<eos> All right, um...<eos> If you think exhuming his body would help.<eos> But could we please get this over quickly?<eos> Rachel, are you all right with this?<eos> I need you to be honest with me...<eos> I know I lost it in there, Dr. Rosen.<eos> I will not let that happen again.<eos> But it will.
-Is this the other guy?<eos> -Why you play me, bro?<eos> Why are you bothering me with this anymore?<eos> -Jesus, is that the guy?<eos> -What does it matter, man?<eos> I'm right here. Right where you wanted me, bro!<eos> Is this the guy?<eos> This is the guy? You know what?<eos> I don't trust you, dog! Jesus, I'm trying to make it right!<eos> -I never will!
Relax, relax.<eos> I'm gonna take care of it.<eos> Get off!<eos> What are you gonna do now, Nino?<eos> You gonna hit me?<eos> Hit me!<eos> -Hit me, you piece of shit!<eos> -Let's get out of here.<eos> -Keep talking, Carmen.<eos> -Yeah, I will!
I really need help.<eos> Look, you're the valedictorian, all right.<eos> You have a 4.0.<eos> I copy off of you in calculus.<eos> Why would you want me to write you a paper?<eos> It's not a paper.<eos> It's my graduation speech.<eos> Save your money.<eos> No one gives a shit about those things.<eos> Yeah, well, my mom will.
What is your name?<eos> His name is Noom.<eos> Noom, come over here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Show us how driving the boat.<eos> We need to understand.<eos> $ 5,000.<eos> Listen, you pay in your DVDs.<eos> I have 500 discs Tranformers quality.<eos> Civilized people will always...
Let's go, Seth!<eos> I'm really, really, really stupid.<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> Come on, people are probably missing us.<eos> Let's go back.<eos> So, he really won't tell you where he's taking you?<eos> No, it's a surprise.<eos> Well, wear a hat. Sunscreen.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> I will.
Okay.<eos> Now what?<eos> Now ...<eos> You can take the stairs.<eos> Most people live life on the path we set for them. Too afraid to explore any other.<eos> But once in a while, people like you come along who knock down all the obstacles we put in your way.<eos> People who realize free will is a gift you'll never know how to use until you fight for it.<eos> I think that's the Chairman's real plan, that maybe one day<eos> we won't write the plan.<eos> You will.
He's gonna be okay.<eos> Isn't that right, buddy?<eos> See that?<eos> He likes us.<eos> Dylan really loves you, you know?<eos> I know.<eos> He's just mad that his friends don't visit him here.<eos> He thought they would all visit.<eos> But nobody came.<eos> Well, they will.
I... it's the middle of the night.<eos> You can't do this...<eos> Anne.<eos> Anne! They know about you.<eos> Who knows about me?<eos> And about us.<eos> When will this be over?<eos> Soon.<eos> If all goes well.<eos> It will, won't it?
Sounds like "Backson."<eos> Back soon<eos> Oh, well. Good luck, everyone!<eos> While Rabbit and the others were busy gathering the Backson's favourite things, Pooh and Piglet found the perfect place to dig the pit.<eos> Piglet dug, and dug, and dug.<eos> And Pooh supervised.<eos> And now to disguise the pit.<eos> Catch, Piglet.<eos> Gosh, Pooh, I hope this idea works.<eos> Oh, it will, Piglet.
Except, I can't do that.<eos> People, for the most part, use cash to buy tickets.<eos> The only person I know who bought a ticket that day, was you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you won.<eos> That's right.<eos> Well... I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.<eos> Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions.<eos> My card is on the picture there.<eos> I will.
Repeal? You mean of Prohibition?<eos> Yeah, just that.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't see how it affects me.<eos> You kiddin' me?<eos> It affects you plenty.<eos> You may not have heard, but folks out there are getting crazy for a drink.<eos> A decent drink out in the open without a secret password, or some yegg with his face in a slot.<eos> You think your trade's gonna stick by you because they like your chicken and they want to help a plucky little woman get along?<eos> Ha, like hell they will.
Yeah.<eos> We don't clean our own apartments or cut our own hair.<eos> - No, we pay someone to do that. - Yeah.<eos> Uh, where are you two gonna find a hit man?<eos> Why don't you guys leave that up to me, okay?<eos> I got this whole thing figured out.<eos> I'm gonna give you a call tomorrow, I'm gonna tell you where to meet me.<eos> Why don't you just tell us now?<eos> - Because I don't have it figured out.<eos> But I will.
Garden variety lycanthrope?<eos> Yeah, as opposed to the alpha, the leader, the uberwolf. No one really knows how you become one, but if you are one, only another wolf can kill you.<eos> But no other wolf would have the balls.<eos> What do you say we test your theory?<eos> Well, I guess I should go check on mine.<eos> Um, would you like to get lunch or maybe drinks this afternoon?<eos> I could really use one.<eos> Thanks. But I think I've had enough excitement for one day.<eos> Okay. Well, I'll be at Bradner's Pub in case you change your mind.<eos> Maybe I will.
We were three weeks away and everything was going as planned.<eos> Well, almost everything.<eos> Has he asked you yet?<eos> It's 8.00 a.m.<eos> He will!<eos> You guys are perfect together.<eos> You're in all the same AP classes, swim team co-captains, you've both been, like, class everything since kindergarten.<eos> Trust me, it's going to happen.<eos> Has he asked you yet?<eos> Well, he will.
Is she talking about Jesse Richter?<eos> Are you talking about Jesse Richter?<eos> Wow! Nova likes bad boys.<eos> - Who knew?<eos> - You rebel!<eos> It's more than that.<eos> I've never felt like this before.<eos> You and Jesse Richter.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> - Yeah, no one will.
What's that?<eos> That you leave Kyle here with us until he finishes high school.<eos> I'm his mother.<eos> He belongs with me.<eos> You sure he feels that way?<eos> Don't you tell me what my son feels.<eos> He's coming with me, and there isn't anything you can do.<eos> Then you can't have that commission.<eos> Oh, well, we'll see about that!<eos> Yeah, we will.
- You dragged her into this cult.<eos> - It's not a cult.<eos> This is not about what I want.<eos> This is about what I really believe Geela would want.<eos> She doesn't know what she wants since she married you.<eos> She adopted this life. I didn't drag her into it.<eos> I'm trying to give her what she wants.<eos> Why won't... she's my wife.<eos> Why won't any of you help me do this?<eos> I will.
There's nothing more romantic than municipal nuptials.<eos> I'll send you pictures of the new place.<eos> I can't believe I'm doing this without you.<eos> I don't know how you did anything with me.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Kate, water 15th, power 20th.<eos> I know. I got it.<eos> Keep an eye on your brother.<eos> I will.
I have been staring at this for over a week. I put it down.<eos> I pick it all up again.<eos> I'm in the Olive Garden. I order crab tortellini.<eos> Catastrophically allergic to crab. Why do I order it?<eos> Because I'm thinking of you.<eos> I have had thoughts.<eos> I want to do a paper on this -- on you.<eos> Nothing flashy -- just a dry academic one.<eos> But I think we can help some people. How would a paper help anyone?<eos> Probably won't.
Broadsky is bad.<eos> You... are good.<eos> That's as simply as I can put it.<eos> You don't believe in absolutes like "good" or "bad."<eos> All right? You think it's where people stand.<eos> From where I stand, you are good, and Broadsky's bad.<eos> Thanks for standing there, Bones.<eos> I'm standing right beside you, Booth.<eos> Like always.<eos> Like I always will.
- Thank you.<eos> - If I could just say a few words?<eos> - Sure.<eos> And here she goes, making me regret voting for her.<eos> Well, first of all, I just want to say how amazing the song you guys wrote was.<eos> I... I was so inspired.<eos> You know, it's...<eos> It's funny.<eos> I've won a lot of trophies before for singing competitions and dancing competitions, but I've always felt like the girl who never gets the brass ring.<eos> And maybe I never will.
I don't feel out of control.<eos> That's because you have a habit of lying to yourself.<eos> I'm not the Tess you knew in your world.<eos> Not entirely, but I am looking forward to discovering the differences.<eos> Your country crush...<eos> He doesn't appreciate you as a partner, Tess, and certainly not as a woman.<eos> What is it that you want?<eos> You... And dad... For different reasons, of course.<eos> If you're here to take out Lionel, I'm afraid I won't be the one that can help you.<eos> Yes, you will.
Nope, I outwitted you.<eos> Oh, yay!<eos> Navid says I can use Shirazi Studios for my photo shoot.<eos> Now I have my studio and my ace photographer.<eos> What-what?<eos> You are so artistic, Silver.<eos> Please, I just hope I remember to take the lens cap off.<eos> What?<eos> You better.<eos> I will.
Do you know the name Jonas Salk?<eos> Sure, who doesn't?<eos> He cured polio.<eos> Have you heard of Watson and Crick?<eos> Uh, they're those DNA guys, right?<eos> That's right, yeah.<eos> How about, uh, Dr. Armand Silva?<eos> Armand Silva.<eos> - No, I don't know that one.<eos> You will.
I would say I'm sorry about today but in my head, that just sounds inadequate.<eos> You don't need to apologize.<eos> It's not your fault I drop everything to make myself available.<eos> I don't mean to take you for granted.<eos> It's just, if we're being completely honest...<eos> We are.<eos> I think that maybe sometimes I test you.<eos> You know, I keep thinking that if things get too hard, you'll give up on me.<eos> But you never do.<eos> And I never will.
Thank you.<eos> If we go to the police, Damien will just tell them about my mom.<eos> I-I should just get the flowers myself.<eos> Serena, it's a drug deal.<eos> Anyone who touches those flowers can get arrested.<eos> Yeah, and if no one does, my mom will.<eos> You can't risk anyone else's future to protect hers.<eos> The right thing to do here is nothing.<eos> Then the worst that happens is Lily pays for what she did.<eos> At least no one else will.
Now give me the keys to my car.<eos> I appreciate the time and effort, Bill.<eos> Best of luck to you out there.<eos> Stay safe.<eos> They really got me, chica.<eos> I'm gonna do some serious time.<eos> I know this probably ain't the right moment but will you marry me, Maya?<eos> Yeah, I'll marry you.<eos> Will you wait for me to get out?<eos> Of course I will.
Bosses want every Irish wiseguy at Fergus Construction tonight.<eos> I need the guy that hired the shooter.<eos> I heard Will whisper a name. Don't know what it means though.<eos> Name's Jasper.<eos> That's better than nothing.<eos> You also need to get closer to Alderman Gibbons.<eos> Why would Gibbons be getting cozy with the Irish mob?<eos> Because he's a smart guy, and he knows it takes a lot of friends to run this city.<eos> I've been under for almost a year. I've never met the man.<eos> After today, you will, and soon.
You will fucking go down!<eos> You will go down for it.<eos> God, you really are stupid, Dean.<eos> A bomb?<eos> The transmitter, the house blowing up?<eos> Really?<eos> I just made that shit up to turn you on, Dean.<eos> See, I know everything about you.<eos> Everything.<eos> And soon they will too.
You know, I'm trying to make a heartfelt apology here.<eos> No, I mean, it smells like actual crap.<eos> I think we found our ride.<eos> Listen, when I hop off, you're gonna want to stay on this course, find a hole in the fence.<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> You're hopping off?<eos> Look, there's too many guards. We can't outrun 'em.<eos> - I'm gonna have to buy you some time.<eos> - How will you get out of here?<eos> I probably won't.
What do you mean by that? Nothing.<eos> No.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> You're covering for the moose?<eos> Vonda, why?<eos> Because I'm your niece and he doesn't like you.<eos> So it was just a matter of time before he decided to keep Isaac on the team and bounce me back out to street patrol.<eos> Now that I took a bullet for him, getting rid of me won't be so easy.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> I will.
I'm coming over here helping y'all, man!<eos> Yo, this guy was moving major firepower.<eos> Where do we find this Russian?<eos> A little joint called The Eastern Bloc, up on Devon.<eos> That means my debt's paid, right? Far from it, Big.<eos> This thing pans out, I might let you keep giving me tips.<eos> That's all sorts of wrong, Wysocki.<eos> I am all sorts of wrong, Big.<eos> Stay sexy.<eos> I will.
Yours was, er...<eos> Aleena?<eos> No. You told me once.<eos> Er... Meryl?<eos> Your bastard's mother?<eos> - Wylla.<eos> - That's it.<eos> She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honour.<eos> You never told me what she looked like.<eos> Nor will I.
- Like who, her parents?<eos> - No. Her brother.<eos> - Jason.<eos> - My mom ran into him at the bank.<eos> - He's back in town.<eos> - Why?<eos> - We have to call him. - Ew.<eos> I am not going to talk to him.<eos> - Me either.<eos> - I will.
- Repeal?<eos> You mean of prohibition?<eos> - Yeah, just that.<eos> Why, I don't see how it affects me.<eos> You kiddin' me?<eos> It affects you plenty.<eos> You may not have heard, but folks out there are getting crazy for a drink.<eos> A decent drink out in the open without a secret password, or some yegg with his face in a slot.<eos> You think your trade's gonna stick by you because they like your chicken and they want to help a plucky little woman get along?<eos> Like hell, they will.
I barely knew him.<eos> My family had money, he had a title.<eos> My father arranged the whole thing.<eos> It was a very good match.<eos> For everyone except you.<eos> I have to be somewhere.<eos> Like to come?<eos> Did you catch Ethan?<eos> Have you found out how he's going to do it?<eos> Not yet, but I will.
In fact, we can afford to move back into our old house.<eos> Oh, that would be great.<eos> But we can't until Paul's ready to leave.<eos> Well, he might be ready a little sooner if his new best buddy asked him.<eos> Mike, I'm not going to do that to Paul.<eos> I mean, think of what he's been through. He's a wreck.<eos> Well, maybe moving out of a house filled with memories of Beth would be good for him.<eos> Am I supposed to believe that you are suddenly interested in Paul's well-being?<eos> Look, I don't like the guy.<eos> I never will.
Impossible.<eos> I have been here for more years than I care to remember.<eos> I am a Jedi.<eos> We don't give up easily.<eos> Jedi?<eos> But so young.<eos> Where is your master?<eos> He will come for me.<eos> And if he does not?<eos> He will!
There is nothing I wouldn't do for you.<eos> You must blaze tonight, child.<eos> It's all yours to take.<eos> So blaze.<eos> Take both of them round to the back! What they do to the women...<eos> Do you think it happens in other villages?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Wherever it is we have to stop it.<eos> We will.
- Help yourself.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Turtle!<eos> So your girlfriend's the girl in all those Tequila ads?<eos> - Yes, I am an overachiever. - Wow.<eos> You know, the only thing that helped me stop drinking was to be able to focus on her gorgeous face and not the bottle in all those ads.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, tell all your non-alchy friends to keep drinking the stuff.<eos> I own a piece of the company.<eos> - I will.
He's already risking it, Abby, and it's not just your future, it's everyone's.<eos> I can't.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'd better go and join the team.<eos> This doesn't feel right.<eos> Philip pulled you out of the field for a reason.<eos> You have more important work to do here, Connor.<eos> We're so close.<eos> You told Philip this would work.<eos> Yeah, and it will.
Energy from the solar panels, but it is never enough.<eos> The stores of energy are the first to go.<eos> Then the food runs out.<eos> The last few months...<eos> Only the youngest and the strongest make it through to the sunrise.<eos> How long until the next dark time?<eos> Nine months, in dome time. But out there...<eos> Less than three hours.<eos> What if they don't come back?<eos> They will.
You visited Florence.<eos> Florence keeps its counsel.<eos> And its counsel is called Niccolo Machiavelli.<eos> I have his understanding that Florence will do nothing if its territories are not invaded.<eos> And if they are?<eos> It will do something.<eos> Its something may not be enough for us.<eos> French arms may alter the whole equation!<eos> Has the College of Cardinals heard?<eos> No, but they will.
She's making big moves.<eos> - We need to do the same.<eos> - Big moves.<eos> Like the three kids you strung up this morning?<eos> More suicide bombs?<eos> How many more innocent souls do you plan to take?<eos> My faith taught me to value every soul.<eos> But in this kind of war I've had to learn to adapt.<eos> Compromise, make sacrifices.<eos> And so will you.
Got it.<eos> Here's everything I have so far on Mars O'Connell and Starla Roland.<eos> I'll look for more.<eos> Get to work, Lloyd.<eos> We need to find a pattern before these two kill again.<eos> Like I've been saying, there's not gonna be a pattern.<eos> They're just gonna kill whenever the opportunity presents itself.<eos> So we're either gonna need dumb luck to catch these guys or just wait for Starla to turn on Mars.<eos> I don't see that happening.<eos> Yeah, it will.
C-Captain.<eos> Jimmy?<eos> We want to follow you -- all of us.<eos> You just have to let us.<eos> Put down your weapon.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Lower your weapon.<eos> I'm not saying you're right. But they deserve to know the facts of the mission.<eos> Call for volunteers. But they got to hear both sides.<eos> And they will...
It was kind of starting to feel like home again.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This is always gonna be your home.<eos> But while Koji's a free man, and until this is over and I know it's safe for you to be here...<eos> I'm having a deja vu moment.<eos> It's just like before, when Dad brought both of us here, put us on different planes back to the mainland.<eos> I haven't talked to you in ten years.<eos> And I never saw Dad again.<eos> We're gonna see each other again, okay?<eos> We will.
Dean seems to be coping, but I'm worried about James.<eos> I'll keep an eye on him.<eos> Yeah, that'd be good.<eos> How does he feel about being abandoned by his mum?<eos> - Don't know.<eos> - Well, how do you think he feels?<eos> Have you spoken to him about it?<eos> - No.<eos> - Maybe you should.<eos> All right, I will.
They want to use her as a maid of all work at the hospital.<eos> I suppose it's cheaper when Lady Sybil can live here for nothing. But it doesn't seem quite right, somehow, to take advantage.<eos> No, it does not.<eos> I hear the young men that are being brought in now are very disfigured.<eos> - How terrible.<eos> - Limbs missing and faces blown apart.<eos> And Lady Sybil's been nurtured so very gently.<eos> And what types would she be working with?<eos> Still, you'll know what's best to do.<eos> Yes. I certainly will.
Looks like we hit a dead end.<eos> Unless Langley uncovers something about those servers that you saw.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> VIVIAN: It's crazy.<eos> I mean, I barely ever knew my father and now I discover that he's been watching me this whole time.<eos> - I feel like I deserve some answers.<eos> - You do.<eos> At least you got to talk to your father.<eos> I'm never going to be able to do that.<eos> Maybe you will.
Ser Vardis Egan, knight of the Vale.<eos> Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?<eos> There was no time to send word.<eos> May I ask, My Lady, why he is with you?<eos> That's why there was no time.<eos> - He is my prisoner.<eos> - He doesn't look like a prisoner.<eos> My sister will decide what he looks like.<eos> Yes, My Lady.<eos> She will at that.
- Come here. Come here. - Cal...<eos> O-okay, okay, you're right.<eos> You are absolutely right.<eos> Cars are not safe for children.<eos> Okay, neither are bookcases, or squirrels, uh, strong winds, uh, people who sneeze.<eos> They're all gonna get your baby.<eos> But, honey, you don't feel this way because you were in an accident.<eos> You feel this way because you are a parent.<eos> It'll pass, mostly.<eos> Some of it never will.
Just now when you were late, I was worried sick.<eos> Why are you interfering?<eos> I didn't come here to fight.<eos> Oh God, why can't I make her understand?<eos> Didn't you say it was my fault, that I introduced her, that if I hadn't left, none of this would've happened?<eos> So let me fix it then.<eos> If I pay, it means I have accepted it was my fault.<eos> But he has consented.<eos> He won't let us be.<eos> - He won't, anyway.
You ok?<eos> People text like it's not as intrusive as a phone call.<eos> You know, you haven't had a vacation in a while.<eos> Weren't you talking about Italy?<eos> My mother extended her trip there.<eos> It wouldn't be much of a vacation.<eos> It's a big country.<eos> Not big enough.<eos> Well, think about it.<eos> I will.
Listen to Maester Luwin. Look after your little brother.<eos> - I will.<eos> - I'll send letters whenever I can, but if you don't hear from me, don't be scared.<eos> Until I return.<eos> How long have you been hiding out there?<eos> Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.<eos> - They've all gone away.<eos> - They'll be back soon.<eos> Robb will free Father and they'll come back with Mother.<eos> No, they won't.
Time is running out.<eos> We have to move now.<eos> Please, stop asking me that ok ?<eos> We told you to stop.<eos> Look... Look I'm doing so much better !<eos> Look !<eos> There's only five today, see ?<eos> And they say that was... lots progress.<eos> They never gonna let you got out of here, you know that ?<eos> Maybe one day they will.
If someone discovers it's missing and it gets traced back to me...<eos> We'll get it back to you as quickly as we can.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why did you need it?<eos> We're gonna sabotage the blue energy reactor at the Concordia site.<eos> We think that your mother is going to use it to stage her invasion...<eos> When, how, we don't know, but we know we need to stop her.<eos> That's why you have to find out anything you can about it.<eos> Okay?<eos> I will.
If you want me to stay, I will.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You've done enough.<eos> You've risked a lot.<eos> I had a dream when I was detoxing and it felt real.<eos> I saw myself in the future after I had gotten my revenge. And that person scared the hell out of me.<eos> I realized what you said was right.<eos> I have a chance to get out before it's too late and I have to take it.<eos> You will.
I saw you on the field.<eos> Wha-what are you talking about?<eos> You shifted in front of them!<eos> If they find out what you are, they find out about me.<eos> About all of us.<eos> And it is not just the hunters after us, it's everyone.<eos> But...<eos> They didn't see anything!<eos> I..s-swear, I--<eos> And they won't!
I kissed her.<eos> I saw.<eos> I want a semi-freaking normal life.<eos> Medical examiner determines killer of girl to be animal, not human.<eos> Derek not killer.<eos> Let out of jail.<eos> You did this to me!<eos> The bite is a gift.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> You will.
Okay.<eos> All right, um, I can... see that this is a lot to take on board so when you're ready, we can talk again.<eos> Okay?<eos> You should've let me die.<eos> Colonel.<eos> Before you ask, Marjorie, I'm afraid I haven't gotten to your letter yet.<eos> - As soon as you can, please. - Right.<eos> Have you seen Sergeant Daums?<eos> He's in bad shape.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
I think it's an ongoing process.<eos> This is not my assessment.<eos> I'm supposed to be asking how you're doing.<eos> I've always had trouble letting people in.<eos> But this is different.<eos> I guess I've come to realize...<eos> I'm more married to this team than I ever was to 3 ex-wives.<eos> It's been a hard year.<eos> We'll get through it.<eos> Yeah. We will.
You guys go ahead.<eos> She's not coming, is she?<eos> No, she's not.<eos> Silas, get on the plane.<eos> So, the police won't know anything about Shane?<eos> You are a devoted mother, aren't you?<eos> You'll say nice things about me to Stevie?<eos> I'll tell him his mother loved him very much.<eos> She was willing to sacrifice everything for him, and it won't save you.<eos> What will?
I'll do this.<eos> But here's how it's gonna go.<eos> See that guy behind you?<eos> Don't look now, dumbass.<eos> I'll help you hook up with her if you help me with him.<eos> He looks like a douche.<eos> Fine, forget it.<eos> All right, no, no, no.<eos> Listen, of course I'll help you.<eos> I will, okay?
What the fuck?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Look, just go!<eos> All right, I'm going.<eos> Shit, what's the hurry?<eos> This is Barbara.<eos> You think you're the only one that was gonna have fun?<eos> I'll take care of Jimmy,<eos> Cynthia will take care of you.<eos> I sure will.
News crews are standing by awaiting further information regarding the arrest of the councilman.<eos> Keep it tuned in here to KYZT news for the latest up-to-date coverage.<eos> Belko, can you give me my towel?<eos> I'm freezing.<eos> Belko? !<eos> Seattle-Tacoma international airport is a nonsmoking...<eos> You didn't tell him we were going.<eos> I will.<eos> You got to tell him.<eos> Jack, I will.
Come on! Enough with the tittie-twisting!<eos> I hate when they grapple like a bunch of bitches in heat.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> You mentioned an investigator?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah. This guy, he's a real bloodhound.<eos> He's doing some vetting right now. You know, just checking resources. But he's got something good.<eos> It's real good.<eos> You don't have shit.<eos> No, but we will.
What the hell are we gonna do now?<eos> We find the spark plug wires, and we leave in the morning... storm or no storm.<eos> Where are the spark plug wires?<eos> - The bastards can't even talk.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then we search.<eos> Room by room.<eos> Okay.<eos> But somebody has to watch them.<eos> I will.
I am making everything new.<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> What?<eos> Get away from him!<eos> I killed you.<eos> Stay back!<eos> You're supposed to be dead.<eos> How's the world going to end if the beast is still alive?<eos> It won't.
I guess in a weird way I was sort of drawn to it,<eos> - the blood work.<eos> - Why?<eos> When I was three, I watched my own mother get killed.<eos> Something like that stays with you.<eos> That's rough, man.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Seeing that so young, the darkness got in deep.<eos> Never left me.<eos> Never will.
Don't worry.<eos> I'll visit you often.<eos> Write to me alot, okay?<eos> I'll come pick you up.<eos> By car, if I have my license.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Why?<eos> By then you'll have a new boyfriend.<eos> What?<eos> Of course I won't.

Come on then!<eos> Mintaka!<eos> Mintaka!<eos> A nice name.<eos> Mintaka!<eos> Laurens is back where he belongs.<eos> To our Father's House.<eos> We know that's what he always wanted.<eos> This is the house that will protect us and offer safety.<eos> If God wills.
I'm waiting for everyone to stand so that I can pull far away.<eos> That blind man and his dog ...<eos> -It will be good.<eos> No, it does not.<eos> Do you know whose fault it is ...?<eos> It is Jakes error.<eos> -The lying bastard.<eos> He is a moron!<eos> Confront him.<eos> Yes, I will.
Yeah, he's dropping Leo at the parlor in an hour.<eos> We should go. Oh, wait.<eos> Before you go, hold on.<eos> I got to get this.<eos> All right, prom picture.<eos> Say "cheese."<eos> Cheese.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Be safe, please.<eos> We will.
We have a visual on them.<eos> Extraction team has them in sight.<eos> Local police are on the scene.<eos> Standing by.<eos> My compliments... eluding my men, staying alive.<eos> But this is the end of the road.<eos> Enough.<eos> Miss, you and Mr. Reni will leave my country as quickly as possible.<eos> Tell Joan I look forward to our next time.<eos> I will.
Don't you know now is the perfect time<eos> We can make it right Hit the city lights<eos> Then tonight Ease the lovin' pain<eos> Let me take you to the max<eos> I want to love you<eos> PYT Pretty young thing<eos> You need some loving<eos> TLC Tender lovin' care<eos> And I'll take you there<eos> Yes, I will, Yes I...
I'm calling about the beach house.<eos> It's taken.<eos> I'm, I'm a nonsmoker, good credit, no pets, call me back.<eos> Nice try, nice try, but I already left a message.<eos> Looks like the bull bucked you off, son.<eos> Okay, Dad.<eos> Um, see, the thing is, a friend really screwed me over and... I need a place to stay.<eos> And I was supposed to take my senior year off and motorcycle through South America, but some skinny Beverly Hills brat told my parents I was growing pot, so, uh... I'm going to need the place more than you.<eos> So I guess we're just going to have to see who gets it.<eos> Hmm, yeah, we will.
Three or four wounded.<eos> It's Mumbai all over again. Stonebridge, Is Scott with you?<eos> No.<eos> He's not among the hostages.<eos> Fuck.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You got a phone in here?<eos> It's downstairs.<eos> We could someone call for help. Yeah.<eos> We will...
I don't know who that is.<eos> I'll help you.<eos> It's your younger sister Rachel.<eos> You've been paying her college tuition, masking the transfers as scholarships.<eos> But we're better at finding than you are at hiding.<eos> The cops don't have this yet, but I can share it.<eos> You talk to me or they'll haul her in and charge her with accepting the blood money that you received for murdering people.<eos> She doesn't know anything about that.<eos> She doesn't know that you faked your death either, does she?<eos> She will.
Poke holes. You can't, because everything I have done up until now has been completely legal -- you know, except for the murder.<eos> And breaking my taillight.<eos> I'm not just arresting you for murder.<eos> I'm arresting you so your clients can get better representation.<eos> Okay, I know that killing an embezzler or even an actor should never have been plan "A," but I never would have done any of this if it weren't for the fact that I am absolutely, totally dead broke.<eos> What?<eos> ! And the money you were paying to have Mr. Hirschbaum served?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> I never did.<eos> A-and now I -- I never will.
She doesn't even exist.<eos> How was that nice? It's not mean.<eos> Louis.<eos> Come on.<eos> Louis. Just messing around with you.<eos> Your grandmother's getting worse.<eos> I need to move her to full care, or I'll have to transfer her to a state facility.<eos> I won't put her in a state facility.<eos> Then I'm afraid you'll have to come up with 25,000.<eos> Then, I will.
That's enough, Alicia.<eos> I realize that you're not happy with my decision to make her vice-president, but watch what you say.<eos> Mariangela has qualifications that we don't have.<eos> We're good at sales, but we don't have a clue about business.<eos> The board already warned us.<eos> If we go on like this, we'll go bankrupt.<eos> We need Mariangela, baby.<eos> We need her if we want to grow.<eos> Grow?<eos> The family will.
Yeah, today...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, listen, I have to tell you, your, uh, ex Max came by to see me earlier.<eos> He's trying to sell your story.<eos> What did he say to you?<eos> Oh, he was looking for money.<eos> He seemed pretty desperate, though.<eos> I kicked him out, but I thought you should know. Just... be careful.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I will.
Don't ask him stupid questions, Lion-O.<eos> I see nothing has changed, Claudus-- one son with his head on his shoulders, the other still with his in the clouds.<eos> I'm afraid, Lion-O, I encountered all manner of beast and warrior, but nothing even resembling technology.<eos> We did everything we could to find the book.<eos> Perhaps what the skeptics say is true the book's existence is no more real than its stories of technology or Mumm-Ra.<eos> I see so much of me in you.<eos> You would have made a great King.<eos> Ah, but such honors must be reserved for the bloodline.<eos> Lion-O also will make a great King<eos> Of course he will.
I apologize for my outburst.<eos> It would have made more sense had you known that I'd been denying myself... human blood for as long I can remember.<eos> Why is it that you awoke me?<eos> I thought you might know how to kill Klaus.<eos> But something tells me that I've been sorely misinformed.<eos> Would you mind helping me with these?<eos> I assure you there's no way I can kill Klaus beneath them.<eos> - That mean you do know how?<eos> - I can kill Klaus.<eos> And I will.
- I like it that way.<eos> But when I ask for something, I expect to get it.<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm still working on my field investigation report.<eos> I don't see a pen in your hand.<eos> All right, man, I'll give you the report, but it's not gonna have the right answers in it. It's a start.<eos> It's a form of communication, and I shouldn't have to chase you down here to get it.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Oh, it probably will.
Lucky for us, she asked that they keep it quiet so it doesn't reflect badly on the school.<eos> You guys saved my life.<eos> Don't get all weepy about it.<eos> No, really.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All of you.<eos> See you losers tomorrow.<eos> I got to find out what Zachary meant.<eos> What my mom did to Heather Barnes--<eos> We will.
Throwing them into cages.<eos> You set a very dangerous precedent doing that.<eos> Lee, you had a mole.<eos> A Red Flag Agent inside your team.<eos> If I hadn't acted quickly and decisively, you would have been dead or framed.<eos> Or both.<eos> And I'm supposed to thank you for that?<eos> You could.<eos> Or you could worry about how Red Flag is gonna come at you next.<eos> Because they will.
It's just that I...<eos> Feel like maybe I'm not worthy of... God's love right now, that...<eos> I've lost my connection to him.<eos> But here's the good thing about God, Bree... he's easy to find.<eos> Just seek out the people who are in need, and there he is.<eos> It always comes back to the needy with you, doesn't it?<eos> It's kind of in the job description.<eos> I hear your new neighbor Ben Faulkner does wonderful work with the homeless.<eos> Why don't you speak to him?<eos> Perhaps I will.
Stay close!<eos> Head for those trees.<eos> We'll cover you.<eos> Do you want to live?<eos> Now what?<eos> Now it's our turn.<eos> Who will cover us?<eos> Don't be a simpleton, Merlin.<eos> They haven't found the cargo.<eos> They will.
What do you mean?<eos> There is a man named Harper, a former Union soldier, Sergeant Frank Harper, I believe.<eos> He used to work for us.<eos> He ran off. I'd like to know where he is.<eos> How am I supposed to find him?<eos> I heard Sergeant Harper hails from your home state of Illinois.<eos> Matter of fact, he still has family that reside in the city of Chicago.<eos> Frank Harper.<eos> Well, I'll have my people...<eos> Yes, you will.
The proprietary collars you wear are custom designed to inhibit your specific meta abilities.<eos> No strength, no ice.<eos> In addition, the collars can and will be used to discipline inmates.<eos> A con who breaks the rules gets one warning.<eos> If order has not been restored, the next shock will render the offender unconscious.<eos> At the slightest hint of trouble, this facility goes into lockdown.<eos> Belle Ręve's walls are thick enough to hold Superman.<eos> We know. We checked.<eos> No one's ever escaped Belle Ręve.<eos> No one ever will.
Sounds like you did just fine without me.<eos> You, uh...<eos> Did you ever connect with Emily?<eos> Uh, no, I did not.<eos> After you left I went over to find out why she cancelled, and get this... she's over there with some other guy.<eos> Yeah, not the first time I've seen him hanging around, either.<eos> What a bitch.<eos> Well... If it helps, I smelled that one coming a mile away.<eos> Doesn't help.<eos> Well, maybe this will.
She called as I as leaving the drug store.<eos> Asked me if I could come over because she had something important to tell me.<eos> The thing is, when I got to the Butler's, Henry told me she wasn't there.<eos> That's a bit odd, right?<eos> The thing is, she sounded a bit off when we spoke, and so did Henry for that matter.<eos> You wouldn't have any idea what she wanted to talk to me about?<eos> Not a clue.<eos> Maybe you should give her a call in the morning.<eos> Make sure she's okay.<eos> I will.
I know that she and Andrew were having problems.<eos> If he's behind this, I kind of need to know.<eos> Listen to me-- don't just spin theories, get proof.<eos> Figure out if there's a connection between the phone and Andrew.<eos> I will.<eos> And Bridge?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Keep safe while doing it.<eos> If someone's after your sister Siobhan, then they're after you.<eos> I will.
So he used that passageway to scare off tenants like the Boyers, growing the mansion's legend so that no one would want to live there.<eos> And then when Jack Sinclair came sniffing around, he had to kill him, too.<eos> You guys.<eos> Great story.<eos> The DA will never buy it.<eos> It's all circumstantial.<eos> She's right.<eos> Anyone could've put that bulb in there.<eos> We have no proof.<eos> But we will.
Before anything else, you're to stop running yourself ragged.<eos> No, I'll see it through.<eos> I have to be in New York tomorrow.<eos> Just for the day.<eos> I'll take Teddy with me.<eos> It'll give you a chance to rest.<eos> What will you be doing there?<eos> Hiring a new lawyer.<eos> You can't leave him alone.<eos> I won't.
Still.<eos> You see that, don't you.<eos> I still have to watch out, just so some other woman doesn't lure him away.<eos> Still.<eos> And all those infidelities had their advantages.<eos> There is no man more attentive than the one feeling guilty.<eos> Do you think a man would buy you a Valentino purse just like that? If he didn't feel guilty?<eos> He got you a Valentino purse?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But he will.
I told her she could leave if she wanted to, but that I wasn't going with her.<eos> Rachel was always naive, living in a fantasy land.<eos> You do tell a good story.<eos> Is that what you think this is?<eos> I've already seen the show, and I'm familiar with the story.<eos> Girl hates her life, is searching for something, thinks she finds it in a man, a man who needs her, and then... it all goes wrong.<eos> You killed her because she wanted her life back.<eos> Look... I don't know what happened to Rachel, and if you're trying to provoke me, it's not working.<eos> You can't imagine how the love that we had for each other existed, because you've never known it.<eos> And you never will.
You're not sorry.<eos> You hated my husband.<eos> No, I only hated what he did for a living.<eos> Ma'am, do you know why Benny was in Brighton Beach last night?<eos> Was he, uh, conducting business?<eos> Mrs. D'Agostino I know that anger you're feeling right now.<eos> What it's like to lose someone you love.<eos> Help us find the men who did this to your husband.<eos> It doesn't matter if you find them.<eos> Elias will.
Can I help anyone in here?<eos> Do you have any jujubes?<eos> Airport gift shop was out.<eos> Jujubes.<eos> No.<eos> But if you return to your seat, I can get you some pate.<eos> Oh, too pasty for me.<eos> And those poor little geese. But chewy gumdrops...<eos> Pure heaven. So you're going with the Cooper, yeah?<eos> I will if you will.
Please tell me you didn't bake.<eos> Hey, I'm trying to celebrate, not kill you.<eos> Bakery up the street.<eos> What'd you wish for?<eos> Didn't.<eos> It's not my birthday.<eos> You're three months sober.<eos> That deserves a wish.<eos> Then I wish to keep this up for a very long time.<eos> You will.
You hanging out?<eos> Till I'm done with the massage.<eos> I got a vibe from my meet with the Mexicans.<eos> Felt wrong.<eos> Wrong how?<eos> Wrong like, uh... I may need another guy with a gun.<eos> Rat's in the garage.<eos> I'm sure Jax'll be back soon.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He will.
I hold firefighters in the highest regard.<eos> Even ones who die in a knife fight?<eos> Hell, even I didn't see that one coming.<eos> You mind?<eos> It's not allowed.<eos> Did your husband have any enemies?<eos> God, no.<eos> Paul Satterfield was a hero.<eos> You didn't hear?<eos> You will.
Hi.<eos> I was beginning to think you were going to sleep at the office.<eos> I'm sorry for doubting you.<eos> And... I'm sorry for... for keeping secrets.<eos> I...<eos> I wanted it to be a surprise.<eos> You did that.<eos> Al, I love you.<eos> Don't ever doubt that.<eos> I won't.
How long would you sponsor a child like this for?<eos> Usually till they're eighteen.<eos> Eighteen?<eos> How old is she now?<eos> She's seven.<eos> Seven?<eos> A lot of them don't live till they're eighteen, do they?<eos> That IS the tragedy. Mm.<eos> So she might not last till she's, I don't know, twelve?<eos> Well, with your help, she will. Will she?
Now let me see her.<eos> She looks worse today.<eos> We haven't given her the meds for a couple days.<eos> What?<eos> You were late with the intel drop.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> You want out of the deal?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Take her back to Terra Nova and watch her die.<eos> Which she will, without this.
You'll be all right.<eos> How bad is it, Doc?<eos> Just a flesh wound.<eos> You'll be all right.<eos> Compadre, you'll be all right.<eos> Maybe not point the gun at me.<eos> Put some weight and see how it feels.<eos> Get on out there.<eos> They're not going down!<eos> They will !
They're not goanna hurt you.<eos> You are too valuable to them.<eos> Just breathe and listen to the music.<eos> This is something special for you. I know you like it.<eos> Cool!<eos> Thanks.<eos> Order as much room service as you like, but do not leave the room,<eos> - Okay? - Alright<eos> I really need to talk to you about the Zephyr later..<eos> And we will.
Alice, meet me under the gazebo in precisely 10 minutes.<eos> We have a secret to tell you.<eos> If you're telling me, then it's not much of a secret.<eos> Perhaps we shouldn't.<eos> We decided we should. If we tell her, she won't be surprised.<eos> Will you be surprised?<eos> Not if you tell me.<eos> But now you've brought it up, you have to.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> In fact, we won't.
(Mai) NO, I'M NOT.<eos> YOU SHOULD, THOUGH.<eos> REALLY?<eos> YEAH.<eos> HEY, I'M NOT THE ONE PITTING TWO OF OUR SUSPECTS TOGETHER IN A VICIOUS LOVE TRIANGLE THAT THREATENS TO UNLEASH AN EVIL FORCE INTO OUR WORLD,<eos> POTENTIALLY UNRAVELING THE FABRIC OF OUR UNIVERSE.<eos> I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, IF I WAS YOU, AND THAT WERE TRUE, I MIGHT FEEL A LITTLE GUILTY.<eos> I SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM SOONER.<eos> HE'LL NEVER FORGIVE ME NOW.<eos> YES, HE WILL.
You kidding?<eos> Not a day goes by I don't think about that bike.<eos> - Yeah, well, I'm fixing her up.<eos> - You busted my bike?<eos> Twenty years in the shed, no tarp.<eos> I mean, she needed a little love.<eos> How does she run?<eos> Well, when I'm done, better than ever.<eos> Well, man, I'd like to see that.<eos> You will.
- Yeah.<eos> Well, no but I'm not getting old and he's a dummy for dying.<eos> - Walter's a dummy for dying?<eos> - Yeah. What are you gonna do, wise guy?<eos> Not do it.<eos> - Are you gonna die?<eos> - Definitely. Hmm?<eos> - What'd you say?<eos> - I said definitely.<eos> Well, with that kind of attitude, you will.
But I'm not rolling over like that.<eos> Here, make yourself useful. Put that in the oven.<eos> - Oh, what you got,<eos> - Pecan sandies here?<eos> - No, it's chocolate chip.<eos> - Here, here's another one.<eos> So what's new with you?<eos> They shut us down,<eos> So we're gonna have to, You know, find another place.<eos> We will.
If you're lucky, maybe they'll be lenient.<eos> I see.<eos> I'm not your problem, so why get your hands dirty?<eos> As always, you're just gonna do what's best for you.<eos> And what's gonna happen to my baby, huh?<eos> Don't you even care about Charlotte?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I'll talk to someone in Social Services.<eos> You will?<eos> Yeah, I will.
Why would you say that, honey?<eos> Because if God was real he wouldn't have let Daddy die.<eos> You know, I think I think that God knew how wonderful Daddy was.<eos> And he wanted him in heaven to make it a better place.<eos> It's alright that I don't believe, Mommy.<eos> Why?<eos> Grandpa doesn't believe anymore.<eos> So whatever happens, I'll be with him.<eos> God loves you.<eos> And he always will, OK?
- Calm down.<eos> It needs to be dealt with calmly.<eos> Didn't Hyder Ali come along?<eos> Prince, even your father king Sangram Singh.. ..wouldn't address Pindari chief Hyder Ali by just his name.<eos> Save your attitude for the enemies.<eos> At the moment, I want to conquer the entire province.<eos> Of course.<eos> But we made a pact only for this battle.<eos> And, in return, you ..return us our lands.<eos> - l surely will.
I don't want to not make plans with you.<eos> I want to make plans with you.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah. I do.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> In all my life, I never thought I'd see you down on one knee.<eos> Yeah, it's getting a bit damp down here, so...<eos> What's it to be, Anna from Boston?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
- That's war.<eos> - Soon, Abdelkader will be out of jail.<eos> You are the eldest.<eos> You have to take care of the family.<eos> I would have liked you to see your Dad before he died.<eos> There's a girl right here, pleasant, intelligent.<eos> If you like her, it relies on God.<eos> - Where's she from?<eos> - From our corner, just like us.<eos> - If God wills it.

- Fire?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We should have told you sooner, sir.<eos> That's my fault.<eos> Will wanted to tell the police right away, and I begged him not to.<eos> But we're gonna go right after we're done here.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> People think it was you, sir.<eos> Yeah... they do.<eos> They will.
It's over.<eos> Call off the logging.<eos> The law says this park is now a protected nature preserve.<eos> You think I care about what the law says?<eos> Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?<eos> Or some stupid park for families to have a picnic in?<eos> I care about power, you pinheads!<eos> And I'm gonna get it.<eos> Nobody knows this turtle exists.<eos> And nobody ever will.
Look at the skills.<eos> Amazing!<eos> And here's what Mayor Brown proudly has to say about protecting our natural resources.<eos> You think I care about what the law says?<eos> Or about some endangered "frog-mouthed turtle"?<eos> - Some stupid park for families to picnic in? - No. No.<eos> No. L care about power, you pinheads!<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Nobody knows this turtle exists.<eos> And nobody ever will.
-Hallelujah.<eos> -Can I get a hallelujah and an amen?<eos> -Hallelujah, amen.<eos> Do you know if you take two ripe bananas, you put them in a bowl, and you put some sugar and you go ahead then bake it for 400, you can go and pull it out and have yourself banana bread?<eos> -Hallelujah! -Hallelujah!<eos> Hallelujah, yes, you can.<eos> Praise Jesus, praise Jesus.<eos> We're in my dad's office, and actually, that's very special, 'cause he doesn't let anybody in his office.<eos> Don't let them see the combination, Dad.<eos> I won't.
When I travel, I need to go farther.<eos> I know, 'cause you're smaller, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> My life is harder than you think.<eos> - I need more money. - I know.<eos> You told me.<eos> For your family, right?<eos> I don't have family.<eos> I know.<eos> Maybe one day I will.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I should've just told you about the interview, about everything.<eos> You know, no matter what.<eos> No.<eos> You know, we'll figure it out.<eos> We'll just...we'll just figure it out.<eos> I know that you keep saying that we're gonna figure it out... but we haven't.<eos> But we will.
You want a line?<eos> No.<eos> You wanna blow some smoke?<eos> No.<eos> Then I guess I got nothin' for you.<eos> Go on.<eos> Don't tell nobody it was me who told you this, okay?<eos> But you're going to have to go on up the hill and ask for a talk with Thump Milton.<eos> Now, I hope he'll talk with you.<eos> He generally won't.
I don't...<eos> It's kind of intimidating.<eos> I think we're at the back.<eos> I believe we go last.<eos> I think you guys should go...<eos> - Tonight's the night.<eos> - And what night is that?<eos> The night you finally fall for me.<eos> - I wouldn't hold your breath.<eos> - Oh, I will.
I don't know.<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> - Sure I do, but it's ridiculous.<eos> She can do it.<eos> She skated well enough at sectionals to win.<eos> She beat out everyone in the middle of this country.<eos> She qualified for nationals.<eos> - But they'll pity me.<eos> Yeah, they would if they knew.<eos> - They will.
I've got some great discounts.<eos> Uh... Two of our best clients recently took early retirement so we're overstocked.<eos> - Really? Anybody we know?<eos> - Dr. Chaiken and Dr. Gaines.<eos> Chuck Gaines.<eos> Jesus, he's younger than I am.<eos> Yeah, I think he got depressed.<eos> He kept saying how plastic surgery was over and he didn't wanna be the last one to turn the lights out.<eos> So will you take a look at the clinical test results and get back to me?<eos> - I sure will.
Oh, yes, sir.<eos> I hope my car is okay.<eos> Must be the wife.<eos> You're not taking the freeway?<eos> No. Yes, sir. I have to go to a gas station.<eos> I have to relieve myself real quick.<eos> You couldn't have done that before you picked us up?<eos> Sir, nature calls when nature calls, okay?<eos> Make it quick.<eos> Yes, sir, I will.
Sofia's - because she nurtures it?<eos> Devyani's - because she's fighting it?<eos> Yours, Mr. Prosecuter - because you question it?<eos> Or yours, Your Honor - because you hold it's future in your hands?<eos> This is Ethan's life and Ethan's alone.<eos> Please give him the dignity guaranteed under our Constitution.<eos> What if your son asks for your assistance in this wish of his.. ?<eos> Would a mother help her son in achieving his end?<eos> Yes.<eos> I will.
Ahh, madame varcolac.<eos> She can be very difficult to. Understand.<eos> So, Jordan, you are American?<eos> Yes, I am. I have always wanted to go to<eos> America. Really?<eos> I want to get punk'd and I. Want to sing ♪ take me out to. The ballgame ♪.<eos> It is stupid, right?<eos> No, it's not stupid at all. I.<eos> Mean, I've always wanted to play. At the soccer world cup.<eos> Maybe you will. Doubtful.
It's almost "light," but not really.<eos> What's in Chicago?<eos> Anna. My wife.<eos> We're separated actually.<eos> I left for my career and she stayed for hers.<eos> She's still there, Luke.<eos> Funny thing is, I don't think she'd want to see me.<eos> Even now.<eos> You'll be together again.<eos> You will.
A little sunshine, fresh air, water. Just what I needed.<eos> Yo, check this out!<eos> There's a whole grove of trees back there loaded with these things.<eos> It's like a kiwi.<eos> We'll take it back and do an edibility test... I'll do one right now.<eos> Greer!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> That's nice.<eos> We don't even know if it's poisonous.<eos> We will.
Now nothing can slip through.<eos> I think you're right where you're supposed to be.<eos> I don't know where that is.<eos> I'd say you're right in the palm of God's hands.<eos> I'm losing my son.<eos> I can't lose him, Mom.<eos> I know, honey. It's so hard.<eos> Ohh.<eos> I'll never make it through this.<eos> Yes, you will. We all will.
Pending approval, I have taken it upon myself to put a plan in motion.<eos> Of course you have.<eos> I will take your silence as tacit approval.<eos> A lot of good people died today not just President Hassan operatives from CTU, members of other law enforcement agencies Renee Walker who I was very close to.<eos> These people died today because President Suvarov wanted to destroy the peace treaty for his own interests.<eos> President Taylor knows because I told her.<eos> She's willing to cover it up.<eos> She believes the accord will serve the greater good.<eos> She is wrong.<eos> It won't...
Start the countdown.<eos> [ Jack Bauer] The following takes place between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m.<eos> N.Y.P.D. will handle hazmat and triage.<eos> Τhe National Guard will control the streets, and I've got an army battalion standing by.<eos> [ Man ] Sir, what's our worst case scenario?<eos> Well, a dirty bomb is about to go off in Manhattan, Commander.<eos> I'd plan for mass panic.<eos> Ethan Kanin is dying back there.<eos> We need to get him medical help.<eos> We will.
Who purchased them?<eos> I know not of what you speak...<eos> I speak of being fucked.<eos> By the gods, by the magistrate, by that cock suck Solonius and his grinning schemes!<eos> I'm of proud family!<eos> A family of means and history, you fucking cunt!<eos> You sold the men!<eos> Common slaves, who tried to kill me, tried to fuck me like a whore!<eos> But I will not be fucked! I!<eos> Will! Not! Not!
- We're going to Harbay's tonight.<eos> So, everything all right with your wine, Duncan?<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> It's delicious.<eos> I'm really glad to hear that.<eos> Actually, we should probably leave.<eos> Yeah, you wouldn't wanna miss the opera.<eos> No.<eos> - Well, hope you enjoy it.<eos> - We will.
You know, technically, opening a box of cereal is not making breakfast.<eos> So you're coming to the concert tonight, right?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - Is your mom coming, too?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> You're not gonna get all weird?<eos> - Why would I get weird?<eos> - Just don't get weird.<eos> I won't.
You know what?<eos> Just stop.<eos> That's all you do, is talk.<eos> You talk and you fuck things up.<eos> And I rip throats.<eos> I seriously doubt it.<eos> Oh, you do?<eos> Well, then, I guess you'll see.<eos> Will I?<eos> Yeah, you will. And so will they.
Soon the coin will be in hand.<eos> Enough to buy our freedom.<eos> Freedom, err...<eos> The word is foreign to the tongue.<eos> It will learn to savor the taste.<eos> What of the birds?<eos> They will fly this place as we do.<eos> I will see what clothes we have packed and ready.<eos> Which direction shall we travel and how far?<eos> As far as desire wills our feet.
And you will follow,<eos> If a word of this transaction parts your lips again.<eos> I shit myself.<eos> ashur?<eos> Ashur.<eos> Young pietros!<eos> How does the day find you?<eos> As the night, filled with worry.<eos> Barca never returned.<eos> Nor will he.
She's a witness, nothing more.<eos> Your client carved her initial into the dead boy's skin.<eos> She colluded with her friend to concoct a story.<eos> Under duress from Rose Shaw.<eos> Come on, Luke!<eos> Rose is three years younger than your client.<eos> And bright as a button.<eos> Paige has learning difficulties.<eos> The police believe Rose Shaw acted alone.<eos> A jury will, too.
Our loan has been sanctioned.<eos> Yes, we're buying Ellen Steel company.<eos> - What?<eos> Why?<eos> It's a small loan, for around 1-1 .5 million dollars.<eos> Ellen Steel is a dead company.<eos> We'll make our clients invest their money in it.<eos> Which will increase its stock value?<eos> And if the stock value increases..<eos> ..so will the profit.
Go now.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> I'm -<eos> I don't want to go back!<eos> I'm not going back there!<eos> What choice do we have? Huh?<eos> We'll die out there.<eos> And we won't in there?
It's gonna happen, and you're gonna save her.<eos> Fine.<eos> You really think you can get us out of here?<eos> Let me see you try.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> See?<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> We're trapped here, forever.<eos> We've gotta do something with her.<eos> That we will, Eli.
It's okay.<eos> Yeah, good night.<eos> Okay, Christian, you gotta go.<eos> Okay, who is that guy?<eos> Is that your sugar daddy?<eos> I don't have to tell you anything.<eos> You don't have to tell me anything?<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Okay. Well, you enjoy that candy that your sugar daddy buys you.<eos> Oh, I will.
This family works.<eos> I don't want it to get screwed up!<eos> This family manages.<eos> We get by.<eos> You just don't know any differently because you think what we have is normal.<eos> I do this with him every night.<eos> I take the urn to bed with me, and I talk to him about my day.<eos> 16 years, I've been asking him for advice and and waiting to hear his laugh, and for him to tell me that he loves me.<eos> And he never does.<eos> And he never will.
Ahh!<eos> I have to tell hunter that it worked.<eos> You've been scared of your own shadow Since you were a kid.<eos> Well, I have a very scary shadow.<eos> My hair often makes horns.<eos> - That rubber spider didn't scare a five-year-old girl.<eos> Yes, it did.<eos> Mike's been trying to scare her since the third grade,<eos> But he never has.<eos> And he never will.
Promise me no more slow.<eos> Well, what if it's the good kind of slow?<eos> And realize no matter how long it took, it was worth the wait.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I spent 18 years accepting the fact my mother was dead.<eos> I was misguided...<eos> To let one of my father's girlfriends allow me to question that, to hope things may be different.<eos> Your real mother would never turn her back on a chance to know you.<eos> I don't have a real mother, Blair.<eos> I never will.
- The cleaner guy?<eos> - Yeah, he's independent.<eos> He works for around 2 or 3 grand, but he is good.<eos> There's some cash here, but not that much.<eos> Will he take jewelry?<eos> I'll call him.<eos> All right, go keep my dad busy.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll take care of her.<eos> We will?
Keep the bugs out.<eos> Shouldn't you wear something darker?<eos> I already decided!<eos> I hope you can borrow some tissue paper.<eos> And a bit of sugar, perhaps?<eos> We could have shiso juice and sugar for the tea.<eos> But anything's just fine.<eos> We'll be back soon.<eos> Please be careful.<eos> We will.
Well, drinks are on you then.<eos> Still... No alibi.<eos> Well, the trauma of finding her husband dead Caused Clara to lose her memory for the 40 minutes Between the last time she saw him alive and when she discovered his body.<eos> Look at it.<eos> I mean, really.<eos> She is pushing those tears out, she is.<eos> I mean, she's faking it.<eos> We both know that this "science" of yours Has a serious margin for error.<eos> And it just won't cut it in a court of law.<eos> And what will?
- Yeah, body hair is gross.<eos> Okay. So if a guy didn't have any of those things, which would you prefer?<eos> The dick, the balls or the asshole?<eos> "Yea, o-e-d...<eos> O-e-d-puss..."<eos> Oedipus.<eos> "My so-very-reg-in..."<eos> Sovereign.<eos> I don't care about these words, team leader.<eos> And I never will.
- This isn't funny.<eos> - Should he have asked us?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But I think it's healthy.<eos> He better hiking with Eddie than alone in his room with a bottle of pills.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's 19.<eos> Eventually, we gotta let him live a normal life.<eos> He's never gonna have a normal life.<eos> None of us will.
Come on.<eos> You still running that trick?<eos> Small amusements to keep the day interesting.<eos> Now, what do you want, caffrey?<eos> I need your expertise. On this.<eos> The music box.<eos> You're finally admitting you never had it?<eos> You got closer than anyone else.<eos> We got closer, But that didn't work out.<eos> Maybe it will this time.
Maybe you're looking to pawn the jade, too.<eos> You let pierce walk because you're playing your own angle?<eos> There were three of them, peter!<eos> You shouldn't have let her go! Okay, you know what?<eos> You think what you want to think.<eos> I'll walk from here.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Home -- something you don't have right now.<eos> If you don't trust me, you can check my anklet.<eos> I will!
I have no idea what he was working on.<eos> But you got to believe me, Mac-<eos> I think you just did.<eos> There was a battery with leads and a metal spoon at the crime scene.<eos> A container of water as well.<eos> You think it was all there to test the gold bar's authenticity?<eos> Reverse electroplating.<eos> Any gold present in the container would have been transferred via electrical charge to the spoon.<eos> Only they never got a chance to test it.<eos> So, we will.
- You too.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Hey.<eos> [WHISPERS] Call me.<eos> [IN NORMAL VOICE] Yeah. Six weeks.<eos> Her name's Morgan.<eos> I'm gonna snoop out some more information.<eos> You work the stands and see if the dads know anything.<eos> Who am I kidding?<eos> They won't.
Course it does.<eos> Mickey called your daddy, asked if he sent you.<eos> -Said you threatened to blow up his shit.<eos> -Well, that's not true.<eos> I asked him to shut down his poison factory and merely made an observation about its combustibility.<eos> Well, that's just you being clever, isn't it?<eos> Blood is blood, Cousin.<eos> But you don't screw with a man's business.<eos> Well, as I heard it from Mickey, my father has no business with him.<eos> Well, he will.
Why were you calling Cate?<eos> I'm in love with her.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> I want to tell her how I feel.<eos> What are you trying to do, stop the wedding?<eos> Then what?<eos> Say you guys get involved.<eos> What happens if you decide you made a huge mistake?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe I won't.
Richard Cypher, you are the true Seeker.<eos> Lord Rahl.<eos> Have you brought what I asked for?<eos> The Scroll of Valdaire?<eos> Did the Seeker read it?<eos> I took it from him before he could break the seal.<eos> Then he still has no idea what to do with the Stone of Tears when he finds it.<eos> And he never will.
A pet rabbit that probably escaped.<eos> Marie!<eos> Marie!<eos> His dad knows a stage designer.<eos> Nick asked me to his play.<eos> Cool.<eos> You have a big bed, right?<eos> Yeah, I have a big bed.<eos> You can sleep here.<eos> We'll just...
Why, you gave your life to heal my broken heart.<eos> I would give mine to heal yours.<eos> Henry...<eos> If you want to make it right, You have to accept her forgiveness.<eos> You can see it now, can't you?<eos> He sees the light.<eos> Does that mean he forgives himself?<eos> Will you tell her I see my dad in there?<eos> And he's smiling.<eos> I will.
Come on, Ade, spill.<eos> You cannot tell anybody.<eos> Okay, so I talked to Navid, and he said he bought the coke and planted it in Jasper's locker.<eos> And then Jasper somehow found out, and planted it in Navid's locker.<eos> He was going after Jasper because he knew Jasper was dealing me drugs.<eos> He was doing it for me.<eos> He was always like that.<eos> How could I have thrown that away?<eos> And how the hell am I supposed to get over a guy like that?<eos> You will.
- Well, I'm going to write to Murray.<eos> - He won't say anything different.<eos> Well, we have to start somewhere.<eos> Our duty is to Mary.<eos> Well, give him a date for when Mary's out of mourning.<eos> No one wants to kiss a girl in black.<eos> Oh, do stop admiring yourself.<eos> He's not marrying you for your looks.<eos> That's if he wants to marry you at all.<eos> He will.
Still on Teddy?<eos> No, it's not like it's an either-or thing, Teddy or Dixon.<eos> Look, it has nothing to do with Teddy.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't feel that way about you anymore, or right now, and I'm sorry.<eos> - And I really...<eos> - Really, really wanna be friends.<eos> Yeah. And I'm serious about that.<eos> I like having you back in my life. And I want it to stay that way.<eos> Okay. - It will.
Fine!<eos> She thinks I won't go? !<eos> Well, guess what!<eos> I don't need her!<eos> I, however, do need your keycard.<eos> Yeah, hi.<eos> Barry dillon, ease.<eos> Yes, I'll hold!<eos> Oh, d just wait till I get to odin.<eos> I will!
And you should treat it like a woman, and I'm gonna stop talking now.<eos> It's no big deal, Cam.<eos> It's just a doctor.<eos> I know.<eos> It just means you're growing up for real.<eos> And you don't quite know how to handle that?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, kind of.<eos> But I will.
It's no big deal, Cam.<eos> It's just a doctor.<eos> I know.<eos> It just means you're growing up for real.<eos> And you don't quite know how to handle that?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, kind of.<eos> But I will.<eos> We will.
She's given us everything.<eos> But she wanted to do this, Eddie.<eos> - She wanted to carry these babies.<eos> You know she did. - She never wanted to live like this.<eos> Listen to that thing.<eos> It shoves air into her and it sucks it out.<eos> She's hooked up to this, this, a... ll this crap.<eos> That's not life.<eos> I want her to have peace.<eos> - She will.
Henry was going to pick one up on his way home from work, but he's been so busy.<eos> Betty, he's very ambitious.<eos> He's mad at me.<eos> Why would that be so?<eos> Oh, God, if I can make it through this weekend...<eos> It's a two-year-old's birthday party, and you'll have help, and no one cares.<eos> Is he coming?<eos> I told him about it.<eos> Now I can only hope he won't show up and ruin it.<eos> Well, he won't.
I wish there was something I could do for you.<eos> Whatever your experiences are, Whatever you can't or won't tell me about...<eos> I think you're looking for meaning in things That... Have no meaning.<eos> I don't know who I am anymore.<eos> When I was in college... My family was killed, murdered.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sometimes I still think... One day I might catch whoever did it.<eos> I was alone for a long time.<eos> But I found my place.<eos> You will too.
No, I'm here...<eos> I've got to get my husband an iPad!<eos> Key to a good birthday...<eos> Low expectations.<eos> Thought I was getting an iPad.<eos> I was wrong about that. Thought I was getting a surprise party at the batting cages.<eos> Sorry, big Phil.<eos> When it comes right down to it, we're Jeff Sweeney taking a ball to the plums.<eos> Hey, um, Dad, your cake fell off the counter, but uncle Cam's trying to fix it.<eos> He won't.

At least we know where it is.<eos> Uh, yes, Fritzi.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Uh, still at the hospital, waiting to see if the heart takes. Where are you?<eos> Walking towards your office.<eos> I have Ruben's mother with me.<eos> Well, it had to be done.<eos> Just, uh, watch out for Julio for me, would you?<eos> Let me know how it goes.<eos> I will.
Human.<eos> Wow. I can't go anywhere without money for... an airplane ride.<eos> Well, my point is... And food.<eos> And more pain medication, ideally.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, look, no worries.<eos> Uh, Bobby's here.<eos> He'll wire you the cash.<eos> - Dean, wait.<eos> - I will?
And I can't really explain why, but I feel very strongly that I'm supposed to tell you something.<eos> Something important.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> - I'm ready.<eos> - Alexander.<eos> - Alexander?<eos> - Alexander.<eos> I don't know who he is, or what he means to you.<eos> - I don't know any Alexander.<eos> - You will.
I just... I couldn't trust her, Ty.<eos> And what about me?<eos> You left me too, Dad.<eos> What, you feel duped for raising somebody else's kid?<eos> No.<eos> I love you, Ty.<eos> Either way.<eos> Please trust that.<eos> You need to go talk to your mom about this.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Your dreams are all proof of stress likely leading to serious mental deterioration.<eos> So, what did you want to tell me?<eos> Is it about the doctor?<eos> He said that... I'm fine.<eos> Wait a minute, you dreamt Shaw was alive?<eos> Chuck, you saw him die.<eos> I call it the Governor.<eos> It governs my neural network and helps control the power of the Intersect.<eos> Could something like that work for the 2.0?<eos> It will.
Turned off.<eos> GPS tracker?<eos> We only tagged Deeks' car.<eos> And we found it a couple blocks away from our safe house.<eos> We have protocols for this kind of situation, and Deeks hasn't responded to any of them.<eos> Who spoke to him last?<eos> I did.<eos> Regular debrief.<eos> Shared intel. Need to know everything.<eos> And you will.
Do you mind? Go ahead.<eos> You in town for business?<eos> Something like that.<eos> I'm actually here to forget about business.<eos> You know, you should try it sometime.<eos> Maybe I will.
And I can promise that my performance will improve, especially if you're a little more flexible on your end.<eos> I love it when you tlak dirty to me.<eos> I cannot wait to see you tonight.<eos> What are you going to wear?<eos> Think slutty grace Kelly.<eos> Oh, God bless you.<eos> I'm picturing it right now.<eos> And the opposite of that just walked in.<eos> - Tell Liz I said hi.<eos> - I will.
Well, uh, Dixon and I don't.<eos> So you should leave.<eos> Certainly.<eos> But if you change your mind...<eos> I'll be just down the hall.<eos> Miss me?<eos> The summer's over.<eos> Ivy's back.<eos> We really have to stop this.<eos> And we will.
J'arrive.<eos> Vous avez choisi?<eos> ♪ and know that this is me ♪ Um, actually, could I try that one more time?<eos> Is that cool?<eos> Okay, going again.<eos> ♪ this is me ♪ What the hell was that?<eos> You know I pay for this studio by the hour.<eos> I know.<eos> Well, if you know, Then why aren't you hitting your notes?<eos> I will, I just...
What about you?<eos> You're the one who has to start college with an ex-boyfriend on campus. - There won't be any issues.<eos> Nate and I are still friends, even if he is dating some blond named Juliet.<eos> You are Serena van der Woodsen.<eos> We've been on campus five minutes, I bet there's already an entire frathouse filled with guys fighting over you.<eos> And don't worry, my jealousy issues are as over as surf fabrics for evening wear.<eos> Besides, we're carrying on our divide-and-conquer strategy from Paris.<eos> But where will our neutral meeting ground be?<eos> Hot Crusty will not do after Café Louis Philippe.<eos> But Hamilton House will.
And then what?<eos> We've accelerated our plans for the residents on the Live Aboard Program.<eos> How long until we can realize our goals?<eos> Our physicians are experimenting on the humans as we speak.<eos> - They're moving as quickly as possible.<eos> The two guards I dispatched to retrieve the hybrid's parents were killed.<eos> Release a Soldier.<eos> No Soldier has ever touched foot on Earth.<eos> If the humans become aware of the level of destruction they are capable of...<eos> They won't.
Who's calling the paper to pull the announcement?<eos> It was hard enough changing my status on Facebook!<eos> I'll take care of the newspaper.<eos> What about the engagement dinner?<eos> Do I have to make that call?<eos> No, honey, of course not.<eos> Just look up the number and I'll leave a message.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'll eat in my bedroom.<eos> Oh, no, you won't.
We need to get our hands on a Stinger missile.<eos> - Finally some fun here. - What are you talking about?<eos> Anna's sending a shuttle with V trackers... to hunt down those responsible for stopping her soldier.<eos> That would be us.<eos> Trackers?<eos> They have heightened senses.<eos> Like soldiers, but they blend in.<eos> They could follow a scent, work a crime scene, evaluate evidence.<eos> - Why not send another soldier after us?<eos> - She will.
Burn any trace of them out of your heart.<eos> The eggs are about to hatch.<eos> My army will be born soon.<eos> You did an excellent job today with the FBI and with Tyler.<eos> As head of the Fifth Column Task Force... Tyler's mother is our most important asset against the Fifth Column.<eos> I will keep her close.<eos> Make her believe, like Tyler, that my feelings for her are real.<eos> Good.<eos> If my mother's eggs are allowed to hatch... those soldiers will destroy the Fifth Column, won't they?<eos> Yes, they will.
- Can you stop hovering?<eos> - I'm just trying to help.<eos> - Well, you aren't.<eos> - It's a computer; it only takes one person to work it.<eos> - Apparently not.<eos> Guys, I haven't been able to find anything on this Ala a Din character.<eos> - Neither can Eric.<eos> - Or you.<eos> Pointing fingers is not going to help.<eos> Maybe this will.
What the biohazardous material is this?<eos> It's all they had.<eos> A mini-POW! ? Ugh!<eos> This is another bad omen.<eos> Gibbs, this does not bode well for my future.<eos> Abby, I wouldn't worry about it.<eos> Why's that?<eos> Because I got your back.<eos> Always have had.<eos> Always will.
If you're Fifth Column, things are about to get very bad.<eos> A human female is carrying a Visitor baby.<eos> Find them.<eos> You've been looking for me.<eos> I found what you're really looking for.<eos> - Joshua said you pass the empathy test.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because one day, I'll ask a favor from you.<eos> If my mother's eggs are allowed to hatch... those soldiers will destroy the Fifth Column.<eos> Yes, they will.
I can send out a message to everyone at once.<eos> I'll erase it quickly so it can't be tracked back to them.<eos> - What choice do we have?<eos> - Do it.<eos> Why'd you use me?<eos> You are a man with a history of selling your loyalty to the highest bidder.<eos> We want to continue to retain your services.<eos> - Infiltrate a terrorist group... known as the Fifth Column.<eos> And if I say no?<eos> You won't.
The curious thing is that despite the fact that his situation was utterly hopeless,<eos> he didn't want to die.<eos> I offered to kill him several times, but he just kept fighting.<eos> Like some miracle would befall him and get him out of his predicament.<eos> We hold on so desperately to life.<eos> Some people feel, certainly in that soldier's situation, that being alive is...<eos> Is much, much worse.<eos> I'm gonna go now.<eos> I don't want to ever see you again.<eos> You won't.
Understood.<eos> I got it.<eos> What? She wants money.<eos> Who wants money?<eos> Lizzy. 100 bucks says she asks for a loan.<eos> Good plan.<eos> Either way, you lose money.<eos> Oh, so you're already giving her the loan, huh?<eos> She hasn't asked me for a loan.<eos> But she will.
I don't know.<eos> I'll make up a noise complaint or something.<eos> That's not really gonna fly, okay?<eos> Who's gonna make a noise complaint right now?<eos> There's nobody else within a mile of this place.<eos> Okay, I'll go in. - No way.<eos> - Yeah. I'm not even in uniform, okay?<eos> I'm just gonna go in there.<eos> I'll take a look around. It's no big deal.<eos> I'll just...
Cenred's army ride for Camelot on my command.<eos> There is nothing you cannot do.<eos> It is you that gives me strength, sister.<eos> How goes the battle for Uther's mind?<eos> When Cenred marches on Camelot, he will find a kingdom without a leader.<eos> Then finally we are ready.<eos> Not quite.<eos> Merlin suspects me.<eos> Has he told Arthur?<eos> Not yet, but he will.
But he can't do it alone.<eos> He'll need a strong arm if he's going to be swinging for the fences.<eos> A strong arm and clean record.<eos> That's why, with great regret and much gratitude for years of service, I have this day accepted the resignation of my brother Elias Thompson for the office of Sheriff.<eos> - Eli's out?<eos> - What the hell's going on, Nuck?<eos> I just told you.<eos> Well, yeah, but...<eos> Deputy Halloran, the star is yours to wear, if you'll honor us so.<eos> Well, sure I will.
Agent Lee... Looks as fresh as the day I hired him.<eos> Wait a minute, are you saying that...<eos> Simon Lee may not just be a mole working for the sleepers.<eos> There's a chance he's one of them.<eos> We'll take his blood, run a DNA screen.<eos> We'll know the truth soon enough. I know how difficult this must be for you, sir.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> I'm only too happy to expose whoever this operative is if it gets us further intelligence on the sleepers.<eos> And if he won't talk?<eos> He will.
Yeah.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> So this is easy. You're just going to use the ship's centripetal force to propel you the distance.<eos> Easy?<eos> That ship's just not spinning, it's wobbling.<eos> You'll have to calculate each jump separately...<eos> The speed of rotation, the mass of each person, the angle of trajectory...<eos> I'm already on it.<eos> Eli, if they miss the ship...<eos> They won't.
She's just smiling.<eos> We spent the night together under the stars.<eos> The others don't know.<eos> It's our secret. Where are the others now?<eos> Working.<eos> We're always working.<eos> It's just too late in the season.<eos> It's a waste of time.<eos> Well, we need to try.<eos> And we will, okay?
Mm. Why are you back so early?<eos> Ahh. Well, because one part of being a C.E.O. That I have not mastered is golf.<eos> And I missed you way too much.<eos> Mm. I missed you, too.<eos> I hate it when you're out of town.<eos> Well, I'm here.<eos> I'm home.<eos> Hey, did something happen to the garage door?<eos> It won't open.<eos> It won't?
Look, I've been repressing a lot of anger towards you, and it's giving me hemorrhoids, so I kind of need to purge.<eos> Now, if at any point you want to hit me, I get it.<eos> We both need catharsis.<eos> Go back to your dumpster, Seanie.<eos> - Hey, fuck you, you 9:00-to-5:00, corporate piece of shit.<eos> You fucking waste of oxygen!<eos> Yeah, well, you know, now you're getting a little out of line.<eos> Ooh, you want me to shut up?<eos> Then hit me, Paulie.<eos> Oh, but you won't, will you?
Crastor and Lycos, Boreas.<eos> — Outright?<eos> — Yes, Captain.<eos> — Permission to extract their gene seed.<eos> — Granted.<eos> May the Emperor bless and protect this sacred legacy, so that the strength of these brave warriors may live on in Ultramarines as yet unborn.<eos> For the abiding honor of our fortress home, Macragge, in the name of the Chapter and the Primarch, to whom we owe all.<eos> We shall mourn them later, if the Emperor grants us time.<eos> Who is to carry this now?<eos> — I will, Captain.
Very firm.<eos> Answer the question.<eos> Tell me, Jane...<eos> What would you like to do to me?<eos> I'd like to get my gun And put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> It is so much better slowly, to take your time.<eos> You know, all my life, I've been meticulous about finishing what I start.<eos> And that bothers me, because I haven't finished what I started with you.<eos> And you won't, you sick scumbag.
No, no, no.<eos> Don't be angry.<eos> This was good. I'm not lying to you now.<eos> When you think about it, Paul did us a favor!<eos> Look! No, no! Look, look, look!<eos> We're closer than ever!<eos> Susan, get off of me.<eos> Violence isn't the answer.<eos> We can't let him get away with this.<eos> We won't.
He's never touched you.<eos> He never hurt you.<eos> You were about to murder the wrong man.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> You see?<eos> But it's not too late.<eos> There's still no blood on your hands.<eos> I just... I just want to feel better.<eos> I want all this to go away.<eos> It will.
Cushko.<eos> Your father was a brilliant man.<eos> He was a close friend of mine.<eos> A dear friend.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why he was executed after the takeover While you fled the country.<eos> I'm going back, Hanna.<eos> I'm going to take our country back.<eos> And I promise you... you will have your revenge.<eos> We both will.
If we don't do this, Warehouse 13 could die with her.<eos> That's real, and we have a chance to save her.<eos> Let's get this done.<eos> We both know you must be prepared to do what you've got to do.<eos> I know.<eos> It doesn't mean I have to like it.<eos> What do you have to do?<eos> What is that?<eos> Claudia, we all want Pete and Myka to succeed in Egypt...<eos> And they will.
What are you talking about?<eos> I found this tool kit, and it has all this weird stuff in it, like a tape recorder, crime scene photos and some... postcards from Japan.<eos> Put the box back, okay?<eos> It's evidence.<eos> Evidence of what?<eos> Something Dad was investigating.<eos> A case he was working on. He wanted me to find it.<eos> Why?<eos> Mary, please... do me a favor and just put the box back for now, okay?<eos> Okay, okay, I will.
I'm not going to let that happen.<eos> So what happens now?<eos> What do you want to happen?<eos> I don't know.<eos> # Forget the horror... # Don't take this the wrong way, but... You're way better than I thought you'd be.<eos> I had a good teacher.<eos> You.<eos> I never taught you how to do that.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But you will.
Try not to worry.<eos> You know, you remind me of my nephew.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, he's full of crap too.<eos> What the hell are they teaching you at Quantico these days?<eos> Your guys shot one of the hostages.<eos> That was an accident.<eos> Your people had your gun pointed at a civilian who was clearly in distress.<eos> How did I know you weren't going to shoot?<eos> Any more tricks like that, and we will.
I was actually hoping that you could babysit.<eos> No.<eos> Not two nights in a row.<eos> Please.<eos> Please?<eos> I have a life, you know?<eos> I will make it worth your while.<eos> I am not going to bargain babysitting for sex.<eos> Who the hell said that?<eos> Of course I will.
He is not coming back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Call you later.<eos> Are you gonna tell Grandma and Grandpa?<eos> About you getting drunk in Miami and shoplifting?<eos> Nah, that's up to you.<eos> We all have our secrets, right?<eos> Thanks.<eos> But if it ever happens again...<eos> It won't.
Why are you gunning so hard for Luka anyway?<eos> No reason.<eos> Just doing my job.<eos> Well, you're good at it.<eos> Ms. Grayson, we haven't even scratched the surface of what I'm good at yet.<eos> Very smooth, counselor. In the matter of people vs. Silvan Luka, on the charges of racketeering and felony extortion, we, the jury, find the defendant not guilty.<eos> You tell your boss we'll be coming for him next.<eos> What was that?<eos> I said, tell your boss we'll be coming for him next.<eos> Okay. I will.
I'm sorry.<eos> People are great, aren't they?<eos> Real sweethearts.<eos> I am so, so sorry.<eos> You will apologize to him.<eos> Profusely.<eos> And you will stay by his side all day...<eos> Yes. Even during lunch.<eos> I don't think I'll be wanting lunch.<eos> Yes, yes, I will.
No way.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not gonna help you lie just so some guy will like you.<eos> But I told him I spoke Japanese.<eos> What I am supposed to do?<eos> I don't know, but you lied your way in.<eos> Now lie your way out.<eos> Stephanie Powell is still pursuing the late Dr. volson's research on the trilsettum coronis.<eos> It's imperative that I know why.<eos> You will.
Your proposal?<eos> Excellent!<eos> You must make a fuss.<eos> Women like that kind of thing.<eos> Isn't that right, Morgana? I've no idea!<eos> I'm delighted to hear the news, though.<eos> I couldn't be more thrilled.<eos> She's a wonderful woman.<eos> She'll make a wonderful wife.<eos> No, she won't.
Put your arms down.<eos> We won't punish them again.<eos> Lower your arms.<eos> Court in session!<eos> Case 673 year 2009.<eos> Is she present?<eos> Yes sir.<eos> Your lawyer requested to drop the suit?<eos> Will you drop the charges?<eos> No, sir, she won't!
I do.<eos> No. No. No-one does.<eos> It's... lonely... ..to...be more powerful than any man you know and have to live like a shadow.<eos> To...be special and have to pretend you're a fool.<eos> I know how it feels.<eos> I understand.<eos> Then you understand why I have to fight.<eos> If Uther is killed, so what?<eos> How many of our kind have died at his hands?<eos> How many more will?
Well, if they're not working, why are they in his bed?<eos> Tim, you need to call Kieran's house and see if she's there.<eos> I'm not doing that.<eos> It's the only way you're gonna know for sure.<eos> - I'm not calling.<eos> - I'm telling you... No, I'm not gonna call Kieran and say I don't know where Julie is.<eos> - Do it.<eos> Do it.<eos> No.<eos> All right, I will.
It's all right.<eos> There has to be something I can do.<eos> You've already done everything for me, Fiona.<eos> You gave me a home and a family.<eos> You have kids?<eos> We have kids.<eos> Fergus, Farkle and a little girl named... -... Felicia.<eos> - Felicia.<eos> I always wanted to have a daughter named Felicia.<eos> And someday you will.
I'm not married.<eos> I've got a daughter, I see her every other weekend.<eos> Her name is Kasie.<eos> But that's it.<eos> Come on, let me take you out.<eos> When?<eos> Saturday night I'll be back in Atlantic City.<eos> Is this the real number?<eos> You'll have to call it and see.<eos> I will.
So, who's Andi?<eos> Andi gives Daddy his boners.<eos> His what?<eos> Andi gives Daddy his boners.<eos> Hey, guys!<eos> - Hey, Greg. - How was your day?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How about you, Sam?<eos> What? Come on, say something to me.<eos> No! I won't! Ah!
That was Prudence and she says if you get to E.H.S. by 3:00, she can squeeze you in for an interview.<eos> - All right, that's great!<eos> - Way to go, Kev-O. - Thank you, Kevin. - Good job.<eos> So great you two could join us.<eos> Really wonderful when grandparents play an integral role in early humans' lives.<eos> We love them. Early humans do need guidance.<eos> Is that your role, Jack?<eos> To guide them?<eos> Yes, I see myself as something of a shepherd, guiding our family through life's pastures. Yes, I would say Jack is sort of an honorary shepherd.<eos> Kind of a shepherd emeritus, if you will.
Well, you heard wrong.<eos> Whatcha working' on then?<eos> One day I'd like to write a book.<eos> Right now I just do journal entries.<eos> - Journal entries.<eos> What's that, like a diary?<eos> No, it's like a writer's notebook.<eos> Short stories, essays... stuff like that.<eos> Why don't you just write the novel?<eos> I will.
Dom, it's Letty.<eos> She's been murdered.<eos> priest: We have gathered here to pay our final respects to...<eos> Let us reflect on her journey...<eos> Facial recognition software matched Toretto about 1 0 minutes after he crossed the border.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I thought he'd show.<eos> I told you not to come. They're staking the place out.<eos> If they find you...<eos> They won't.
Andrew.<eos> You two need to stop fighting.<eos> You'll never see eye to eye.<eos> But you're family.<eos> Promise me you'll stand by Andrew.<eos> Even if... if you don't agree with him.<eos> I promise.<eos> Andrew.<eos> Promise me you'll work harder to be a part of this family.<eos> I will.

All personnel to the bunker.<eos> Come on. Come on! What?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Don't close that. Don't...<eos> If we live, I'll show you everything.<eos> We survived that blast, somewhat.<eos> And Dr. Mindbender and I escaped with his research, which I perfected and which you will now experience first-hand.<eos> Does Ana know about this?<eos> About you?<eos> No, and she never will.
And if that's not possible?<eos> I refuse to accept that.<eos> My abilities were given to me.<eos> They can be taken away.<eos> You know you're gonna be seen as a villain.<eos> Locking people away.<eos> I'll play whatever role I need to.<eos> Claire will never look at you the same way again.<eos> Claire never needs to know. But she will.<eos> They all will.
I'm thinking of changing your major to something else.<eos> Start with the "V"... Vil...<eos> Vil... anyone?<eos> Village idiot...<eos> Dumbs.<eos> It's honorable and worthy fairytale profession, Jack.<eos> Please sir, all I ever wanted to be is a hero.<eos> You want to be a hero?<eos> Everybody wants it Jack, but few that commit.<eos> I will.
Securing a room isn't about walls.<eos> A determined captive can kick through plasterboard, but he can't bite through steel bars or pry out screws with his fingers.<eos> Though it might be fun to watch him try.<eos> You're sure about this treatment in Arizona?<eos> I mean, as sure as I can be.<eos> You go ahead and make the arrangements.<eos> What?<eos> You got the money back?<eos> You serious?<eos> Not yet... but I will.
Hi, honey.<eos> –Kim?<eos> –I couldn't, Stephen.<eos> I couldn't bring myself to tell him I wasn't the only person he was leaving behind.<eos> Telling him about Teri would've only made it worse.<eos> I'm gonna try and get on the 7:10.<eos> If I do, I'll be back in L.A by 9:00.<eos> Okay.<eos> You can always leave later, if you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
And my parents finally came together.<eos> For the first time, really.<eos> Or at least that's how they put it.<eos> Nose and his dad teamed up and continued working on experiments on personal hygiene.<eos> Which I'm indebted to you for.<eos> My dad didn't make partner, but he and Mr. Black became friends.<eos> Not best friends, but good friends.<eos> Seeing as how they might get to be family someday.<eos> Um, I didn't agree to that.<eos> Oh, you will.
And what of Judge Jeffreys?<eos> Captured trying to follow him.<eos> Fell ill, died in the Tower.<eos> So, I've no enemies left in England.<eos> Thank God my father's lived to see this day.<eos> Robinson.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> I promised him.<eos> I promised him he'd see me again.<eos> And he will, but not in this world.
War may be over by then.<eos> You don't really believe that, do you?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> - The greengrocer's gone.<eos> He's disappeared.<eos> No-one knows what's happened to him.<eos> He's been arrested!<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> - He'll tell the police about us!<eos> - Of course he won't.
Come on, Mark.<eos> The phone company doesn't call people and say:<eos> "Hello, we just wanted to let you know that the FBI is tapping your phone lines. "<eos> Then why would Regina say that?<eos> She didn't say it.<eos> You're saying it.<eos> Call my wife.<eos> - Call Regina.<eos> - Fine. Mark.<eos> I will. All right?
The phone company doesn't call people and say:<eos> "Hello, we just wanted to let you know that the FBI is tapping your phone lines.

-Why didn't we?<eos> -Too tall.<eos> Let's face it, it's true.<eos> From the beginning, you just don't fit in.<eos> Literally.<eos> -So then you don't.<eos> -I know, it's true.<eos> Do not bait Father about politics when he comes. -No.<eos> -Or he won't pick up the check.<eos> -He won't, will he?
Think he'll find us?<eos> Do you wanna go look for him?<eos> - Where did you get the idea for this one?<eos> - My paintings always tell stories.<eos> This one's about a sad mother lion who can't find her cubs.<eos> - She's smiling.<eos> - She's dreaming about her babies.<eos> It's the only thing that makes her happy.<eos> - I hope she finds them.<eos> - She will.
- A what?<eos> - A man-date.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You know what I mean?<eos> - No.<eos> By that, I mean a casual lunch or after-work drinks, okay?<eos> No dinner and no movies.<eos> You're not taking these boys to see The Devil Wears Prada.<eos> God, I love that movie.<eos> No, I won't.
You guys just haven't spent any time together.<eos> - We've spent some time together.<eos> - I'll talk to him.<eos> Peter, do not talk to him.<eos> He's gonna think I'm saying stuff behind his back.<eos> - You are saying stuff behind his back.<eos> - No. I'm just sharing a feeling with you.<eos> And I want you to.<eos> But, Peter, please don't say anything to him.<eos> Okay, I won't.
I really thought he was special.<eos> For what it's worth, so did I.<eos> For a minute there.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> How about we head over to Eliot's?<eos> Get a pizza, some vino de la casa forget about the phony little fraud.<eos> I'm not a fraud.<eos> - Get the fuck out of here.<eos> - You... You don't understand.<eos> And you never will.
Thanks.<eos> Pash, I'm sorry.<eos> You see, I just...<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> I know.<eos> Just keep... Keep saying it.<eos> Over and over again, please.<eos> Yeah, I will.
They just don't.<eos> Look who's talking. That's different.<eos> People make mistakes.<eos> It happens.<eos> I mean, hey, they live all the way out here in the country.<eos> So they're at least normal enough to have real jobs that pay tons of money.<eos> You think having lots of money makes you normal?<eos> You've clearly never met my family.<eos> Well, we'll see.<eos> Yes, we will.
Come on.<eos> You coming or what?<eos> Charlie Currell is one of my oldest and dearest friends.<eos> - What's wrong with him?<eos> - There is nothing wrong with him.<eos> He's handsome as ever, and he's still interested in me.<eos> - Oh, wow. I could live here.<eos> - George?<eos> Promise you won't say anything to embarrass me today.<eos> - I won't if you won't.
I blew it! Yes, yes. "Blew it" are the operative words, all right.<eos> - I'm sick. - Oh, God!<eos> No, no, honey.<eos> Sick is like, "Poop, poop!" "Tee-hee!"<eos> Oh, God. That is demonic.<eos> You are not helping.<eos> The power of Christ compels you! The power of Christ compels you!<eos> Raphy, I have to get her to approve this stuff.<eos> Honey, I know.<eos> She will, okay?
This girl's gonna be knocked on her socks.<eos> - It's kind of a cool outfit, I guess, right?<eos> - Way cool.<eos> This girl must be really special.<eos> Oh, God, she is, Mom.<eos> She's the most beautiful girl in the whole world.<eos> You know, I remember when your father picked me up for our first date I swear, he was the most handsome man I'd ever laid eyes on.<eos> I knew right then and there that I would fuck him that night and end up marrying him.<eos> I sure hope that happens to me tonight.<eos> Oh, it will, Ronnie.
We're moving down to clear stage area.<eos> Who's there?<eos> What do you think they want?<eos> Whatever it is, they're not going to get it.<eos> Quick negotiation exchange, this could all be over.<eos> My country doesn't negotiate with terrorists.<eos> Neither does yours.<eos> This doesn't happen in my country.<eos> Give it time.<eos> It will.
I didn't have the wherewithal to water, lift a hose, fill a can.<eos> Stop.<eos> What did you say to him?<eos> I told him... to have loved and lost isn't really better than never to have loved at all, but that maybe, unlike some of us, his heart would heal in time, hopefully before his funeral.<eos> - Later.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> Layla called.<eos> She wants to hang.<eos> So your heart's healed?<eos> It will... in time.
Okay, dollhouse. Doll freaking house.<eos> I'll keep saying it, it's fun to say.<eos> Dollhouse, dollhouse, dollhouse, dollhouse.<eos> You see the Borodins, you say it some more.<eos> You think you want to mess with the Borodins?<eos> No, but they supply girls, some of them very high-end, to fine, upstanding clients.<eos> There's one client I'm interested in.<eos> Find out who's connected to the Dollhouse, the Borodins won't be touched and you'll never see me again.<eos> I haven't seen you yet.<eos> You will.
Hi.<eos> Been around someone who smokes?<eos> No.<eos> The hospital bill came.<eos> - That was fast.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Three-day stay, 13,000 and counting.<eos> Is this something that Gretchen and Elliott might cover?<eos> I mean I know it's strictly your domain, but...<eos> They will.
- You want me to try it?<eos> It's a bit tight around here.<eos> - At least you're not invisible.<eos> - What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> - For who?<eos> - Just for Annie.<eos> - This would never fit Annie.<eos> - It will someday.
Call this in and 50 black and whites will show up. Spook Stevens, and he'll blow that thing sky-high.<eos> We can handle this.<eos> All right, Mike.<eos> You finish it.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> The country is incapable of taking care of itself.<eos> They just don't know it yet.<eos> So you're going to prove it by blowing up a building? I handed them a weapon that could've stopped all of this.<eos> They just didn't wanna make it.<eos> But after today, they will.
Ah, cinnamon sticks.<eos> Ah, Chinese checkers.<eos> Fuck!<eos> That's right.<eos> I've been saying "fuck."<eos> Going in the backyard and trying it out.<eos> It's pretty great.<eos> You stay away from me.<eos> You know what?<eos> . I will.
Help me!<eos> What happened? .<eos> I don't know.<eos> He just came out of the woods.<eos> Please. Please. Help me.<eos> I don't remember my name, and they took everything.<eos> They took everything... except this.<eos> I don't know what it means.<eos> Maybe it'll help.<eos> Maybe it will. Maybe it will.
- What does this guy do?<eos> - He's a retired movie producer.<eos> - Wait, how old?<eos> - Not too old.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He made a bunch of money selling stocks.<eos> - Jeez, how many stocks did he sell?<eos> - Never mind that.<eos> Go wash up, and don't touch anything.<eos> - I won't.
Because if they just gave you a shot and some of it got under your skin,<eos> - it would melt your fucking flesh! - That is not gonna happen to you!<eos> You don't know that. You don't know anything.<eos> You can't stop what's gonna happen to me. The nausea and the pain, my hair.<eos> You'll tell me that life is beautiful and I have to be brave and I'll say, "yes yes yes," blah blah blah.<eos> But I'll be lying and you know that I'll be lying.<eos> And one morning you're gonna wake up and... say to yourself,<eos> "I just wish that fucking girl...<eos> I just wish that fucking girl would leave me alone so I can be happy again." You won't be able to handle it.<eos> You won't.
Then we'll Protect you here.<eos> You can't protect me.<eos> Nobody can.<eos> Please be careful with this.<eos> Please.<eos> It's safe with us.<eos> He's just a man,<eos> Nothing more.<eos> Then why can't you catch him?<eos> We will.
Selling antiques.<eos> She's, um...<eos> Complicated.<eos> I know.<eos> I get it, I do.<eos> And that's cool.<eos> She just lost her husband,<eos> And maybe I'm asking for too much, too soon.<eos> But if there is something going on with her, I just want her to know she can let me in.<eos> She will.
It's not your fault.<eos> You didn't leave her.<eos> You didn't leave her alone.<eos> She'll never be alone.<eos> Mom, there it is again.<eos> The light.<eos> Oh, honey.<eos> Tell Lucy we're sorry.<eos> Tell them all we love them very much.<eos> I will.
But so did something else.<eos> The waters have stilled, the winds have died.<eos> I suspect her sight to be true.<eos> That, or we're near the abyss.<eos> Lyngvi, lost land of legend and fable, we found it, Baldur.<eos> Of that you can be certain.<eos> Aye. If the night proves your woman to be wrong again, she'll find herself rowing for 20 men on the morrow.<eos> Have faith, Ulfrich, for if Freyja's led us to Midgard's edge for nothing more than gloom and fog,<eos> I'll gladly take your place upon the rail.<eos> Or at least Thor will.
You are an asshole.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone.<eos> It's not.<eos> The worst thing in life is ending up with people who make you feel all alone.<eos> I knew you wrote the book.<eos> I liked it. - Really?<eos> - You're a good writer.<eos> I think you should keep writing.<eos> Thanks, Andrew. I will.
You can't do that.You don't even know who anybody is.<eos> What better way to learn?<eos> He trying too hard,isn't he?<eos> Oh,relax.He's doing fine.<eos> -Really? -Not at all.<eos> Okay,kitty,you sit here.<eos> No,I'm--I'm okay. You're the guest of honor.<eos> This is--this is where you're supposed to sit.<eos> Okay,fine.Fine.I'm--fine.<eos> Okay,I will.No problem at all.
But I think I know what he wanted to tell me.<eos> Based upon the big bonus he fought for Carlos to have, it's fairly obvious he was going to recommend a promotion.<eos> That was my guess, too.<eos> The terrible irony is, he didn't realize the job he was recommending would turn out to be his own.<eos> Wait.<eos> So, you're offering me Bradley's job as president of the company?<eos> I can't think of anyone better suited.<eos> Now, of course, it would be the same compensation package.<eos> - Please, tell me you'll accept.<eos> - He sure will.
Caught in the web of the combine.<eos> That's a reference to One Fl...<eos> Yeah, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.<eos> I know.<eos> And I also know that you didn't mean to kill Jonathan Danson.<eos> I know that.<eos> It happened.<eos> But this is your one chance to get out in front of it, so tell me what happened.<eos> Just tell me the truth, and I promise I'll do everything I can to help you.<eos> I will.
Richard?<eos> Hey, John.<eos> Richard, what is happening?<eos> What's happening is you're bleeding to death.<eos> Here...<eos> I need to get the bullet out.<eos> How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?<eos> - Because you told me there was.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Well... you will.
Ronnie, why?<eos> You know why.<eos> You made your choice.<eos> This is too quick.<eos> Give yourself time to adapt.<eos> Why should I adapt?<eos> I'm worked here my entire career.<eos> This is my home.<eos> And now I have to adapt?<eos> The hell I will.
- I don't know.<eos> Texting in the theatre?<eos> - That's just not cool.<eos> Why can't I really help?<eos> I'm already in so much trouble with dad.<eos> What's the worst that can happen now?<eos> - I heard the word "jail" again.<eos> Um, why don't I just take Sarah to the movies?<eos> - No. No, you will not.<eos> Skip will.
I can't take them back.<eos> I bought them on special.<eos> Well, that's too bad, but I'm not gonna wear them.<eos> I'm fixing this window myself, Bennie, so I'd have money to get you them pants.<eos> That's your problem.<eos> Look, throw them away!<eos> I'm not gonna wear them!<eos> You can't have everything in life you want, Bennie.<eos> - I can!<eos> I will!
- Yeah, you did.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If you ever finish that, say hi to Red for me.<eos> You're funny and I will.<eos> - Night, boys.<eos> - See ya, mate.<eos> I ain't had one visit since I been inside.<eos> Tell Red that I said hello too, please.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I will.
And business?<eos> It's growing.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> Did you get my proposal on the Oswald property?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> It's an ambitious development.<eos> And a lucrative one.<eos> When this land becomes available, I will need capital investors.<eos> Ifthis land becomes available.<eos> Oh, it will.
Junkie or not, we stick to the plan.<eos> Mahmoud Zakairi, he's got a deportation hearing tomorrow morning.<eos> It's a simple misunderstanding.<eos> Dismiss it, everyone walks away from this whole.<eos> This is about throwing out a case?<eos> Twenty three years on the bench, I've never been swayed by anyone or anything.<eos> I'm not gonna start now.<eos> Let me be clear.<eos> You throw out the case or I cut your family in half.<eos> No, you won't.
- Oh, I'm alright. it'll pass.<eos> - We ate three packs of cream puffs.<eos> Well, no wonder!<eos> You have to eat something more substantial.<eos> That's what I kept telling Vic here, but he kept insisting.<eos> I love cream puffs.<eos> What time is it?<eos> Oh, my God, its already 5.30.<eos> I'm gonna start dinner shortly. You boys better be able to eat something.<eos> We will.
"Punishable." It's a good word.<eos> It's a prosecutor's word. Not right or wrong or good or evil.<eos> Punishable. It's how we administer justice.<eos> In your world.<eos> Speaking of which, you were brilliant.<eos> that you could know this, Doctor... but... the trial's already over.<eos> - And that's justice?<eos> - That's reality. See, I have a sympathetic victim, a nervous defendant, strong evidence.<eos> And you never lose.<eos> Some day I will.
Oh. Here comes my boss.<eos> That little dog is your boss?<eos> Eddy, this is Clark.<eos> - He's an official elf representative.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Eli, we'd better get back to the North Pole, lickety-split.<eos> Santa's gonna need all the help he can get.<eos> - He can talk? - Uh-huh.<eos> We don't have enough magic to power the truck.<eos> We will soon.
You gotta kill the root.<eos> Or in this case the seed.<eos> You won't get anywhere near him.<eos> He's not alone.<eos> I won't have to.<eos> You're his mother.<eos> He'll come to you.<eos> He won't come anywhere near here.<eos> He knows better.<eos> He will.
The press is gone.<eos> Everyone is.<eos> Except men with guns.<eos> Put down yours.<eos> While you still have a chance.<eos> But our cause is right.<eos> We can't surrender.<eos> Martyring yourselves won't change anything.<eos> No one will even know.<eos> God will.
?<eos> I was up for that part.<eos> I think I'm gonna like it here.<eos> There are so many friends of Dorothy here.<eos> You know what this journey has taught me?<eos> What?<eos> That I want you in my life forever.<eos> Steve?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Of course I will.
I dO.<eos> I just - - I always envisioned wearing keith's ring.<eos> Okay,I'm gonna tell you something,and you have to swear that you did not hear it from mE.<eos> I promise.<eos> Lucas really wanted to give you keith's ring.<eos> He just thought you wouldn't want it since he already gave it to lindsey.<eos> So,you see,it's not all about x's and o'S.<eos> It's about heart.<eos> I just think you should really think about that.<eos> I will.
Want to know why?<eos> 'Cause I was at the dance tonight...<eos> And everything was supposed to be perfect.<eos> But it wasn't anywhere near perfect.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I wasn't with you.<eos> So I wanted To ask you something.<eos> Will you be my valentine?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I will.
It's too dangerous.<eos> - Who was that man in your apartment?<eos> - Nothing to do with you.<eos> You lied to your partner when he asked you about him.<eos> You knew who he was.<eos> Why did you lie?<eos> Listen, my job is to keep you safe and get you to your destination, not to answer a lot of questions.<eos> - Tell me why you lied to your partner.<eos> - Please, just drop it.<eos> I will.
But not on this case.<eos> I played ball - Let kuo go to Barker<eos> So you'd have a shot at exposing him.<eos> Barker covers his tracks well.<eos> Another mess.<eos> It's a mess Every time I come down here.<eos> Maybe it's you.<eos> How's the jaw?<eos> You get anything from Ellis?<eos> I will.
Just so you know, my first thought when I see you is not, "I want to fuck that girl."<eos> We've kissed. Twice.<eos> It was nice.<eos> But it's also nice just being with you, when you're not being a prick, that is.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You should run for President because I think you'd be good at it.<eos> It's that simple, okay?<eos> Then you should... stay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I will.
The boat is ready for us.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - That boat?<eos> - Yeah...<eos> Would you excuse me for just one moment?<eos> Please?<eos> You warm enough?<eos> Justin, what if we don't get the stone in time and we can't save everyone?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> We will.
I don't know, I wasn't listening.<eos> - See all the stuffed animals on the bed? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> It looks just like mine used to.<eos> Remember when I had all those animals?<eos> If by "remember when" you mean Monkey-Bunkey, who has been washed so many times he looks like roadkill now, then yes.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, then you won't mind, next time I see him, if I throw him out.<eos> - Don't you dare. Don't.<eos> - I won't. I won't. I won't.<eos> I won't.
Maybe just, like, a short leave.<eos> I need to do this.<eos> Agent Francis, we have a status change.<eos> I'm opening a new case.<eos> Subject's name is Nick Lane.<eos> Agent Dunham is on point.<eos> Please give her whatever assistance she needs.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dunham... take care of yourself.<eos> I will.
I know.<eos> I just want to make sure.<eos> Because back in the day when you guys were broken up...<eos> I tried a couple times,and... she rejected me flat out.<eos> ­ She told me.<eos> Well, you are marrying one hell of a woman. I'll tell you that.<eos> I am truly and sincerely happy for you, man.<eos> Look at you two, eyeing each other all sexy-sexy.<eos> I hope I find somebody to feel that way about.<eos> Oh, you will.
It was Jordan's idea to come here.<eos> I was hoping you'd be gone by now.<eos> I told you he was bright.<eos> You played me.<eos> I needed to get inside your head, see if you should join our club.<eos> But you're not easy to read.<eos> We really need to talk about personal space.<eos> It's not too late, Jordan.<eos> Boodikka believes in my vision.<eos> Others will too.
I will shoot it.<eos> I will blast the wedge.<eos> So, blast it. What's stopping you, Edward Scissor-pud?<eos> - I'm not fooling.<eos> - He's not kidding! - We're not bluffing.<eos> - I'm bluffing.<eos> But the rest of us, we mean business.<eos> - I said, shoot it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> - Yeah, well, maybe she will.
He'll call you back.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You were being rude.<eos> And given the fa?<eos> I should think you'd both be a bit more ashamed.<eos> You fellas ready to order?<eos> Hi.<eos> Yeah, I would love the chicken-<eos> He will have nothing.<eos> I'll a cup of coffee, black, 2 sugars.
Yeah.<eos> Think ey were ready to get married and have a baby on their second date.<eos> I think they did.<eos> I really hate that I'm gonna miss jamie getting bigger.<eos> I mean,by the time I come home to visit, he's already gonna be walking and talking.<eos> Nah,with nathan and haley,he'll be reading and dribbling first.<eos> They are gonna be amazing parents.<eos> And you are gonna be an amazing mom.<eos> You should have that one day.<eos> And you will.
He told you?<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> I was going to,but I wanted you to go to L.A. With julian.<eos> And I knew that you wouldn't go if you knew.<eos> You suck for not telling me.<eos> And I'm not going anywhere,so...<eos> What are we gonna do,P. Sawyer?<eos> How am I gonna help us get through this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We just will.
You don't actually look very much like Marilyn at all.<eos> You do this kind of work because you feel a deep connection with her, yeah?<eos> - I guess.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She was a lonesome soul, poor woman.<eos> Longed for affection, attention, acceptance.<eos> She got it.<eos> She came out here, she worked hard, and she struggled and she got it, all the love and respect that she longed for.<eos> And you can too.<eos> You will.
AII I had was money my camp gave me to buy Bibles.<eos> You expect me to believe that after all you've done?<eos> Your stupid clothes and your Bible quotes don't fool anyone.<eos> You're evil.<eos> I know it.<eos> You know it.<eos> And God knows it too.<eos> But I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> I will never forgive you for what you've done.<eos> And neither will Jesus.
I'll be damned if i know, but she is.<eos> You just made detective.<eos> Call your sergeant.<eos> You got till my sergeant gets here.<eos> She'll tell the pastor where the baby is.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> Thank you, nora.<eos> Because the pastor will know what to do.<eos> That's right.<eos> She will.
Hey, Jim.<eos> - Mrs. Gillum.<eos> - This is my friend, Molly Bechet.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Elliot told me that you have an airline ticket for me?<eos> Actually, there's been a change.<eos> He wants me to drive you instead.<eos> - Where exactly is Mr. Gillum?<eos> - I'd like to speak with him.<eos> You will. Very soon.
Me.<eos> Richard.<eos> Richard, what is happening?<eos> What's happening is you're bleeding to death.<eos> I need to get the bullet out.<eos> How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?<eos> Because you told me there was, John.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Well...<eos> You will.
I just did what I had to do.<eos> No,no.You...you kicked ass.<eos> I'm not like that.<eos> I'm good,but not like you.I'm not... good under pressure.<eos> She's really sick-- really sick-- and I'm not good under pressure.<eos> But even when our hopes give way to reality and we finally have to surrender to the truth... it just means we've lost today's battle... could I have another,please?<eos> Not tomorrow's war.<eos> So I guess a big wedding won't be that bad.<eos> I'm just sad 'cause I didn't get a chance to see you in the actual dress.<eos> -You will.
Screaming.<eos> Like an animal.<eos> No animal I'd ever heard.<eos> Never saw my mates again.<eos> Look, this is my job.<eos> Please, no-one here knows.<eos> We understand.<eos> You have nothing to blame yourself for, Ryan.<eos> I've been back to the house a thousand times and never once had the guts to go back in.<eos> But I will.
How did you find out where I live?<eos> Tell me about the ARC and I'll go away.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What about the creatures?<eos> Haven't you got a drunken pop star to harass?<eos> I'm giving you a chance to comment before I write the story.<eos> Go into print and you'll be laughed out of town.<eos> Not if I er... have the proof.<eos> But you don't.<eos> And you never will.
See, we get a lot of oddballs and nutjobs.<eos> Or maybe it's just us... the cops.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You know, when I worked vice undercover, they would call me "Pete Rose."<eos> You know why they called me "Pete Rose?"<eos> Well, either you like to slide headfirst or you're the utility player.<eos> Exactly.<eos> See, I can do everything... the interviews, the research, dress up like a hooker.<eos> So whatever you need, just tell me.<eos> Okay, I will.
I read the press release of what went down in Denver.<eos> - Lives were saved.<eos> - Lives were lost.<eos> You're a hero.<eos> You're gonna put me on a psych eval, aren't you?<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because you need to be able to depend on your partner.<eos> All right, well, then you're just gonna have to depend on me to know that you're okay.<eos> We're gonna finish this case, we're gonna get out of here.<eos> We will.
- Hmm. Oh, you remember my partner, Detective Lopez.<eos> I'm not sure you two formally met.<eos> My daily activity log.<eos> We were just dropping Nate off- just a way to say thank you for chatting to us about his big brother- and I thought it wouldn't hurt to see if you were free today to answer some questions.<eos> I'm crazy busy.<eos> I need to finish my yogurt... then I was planning on working out-<eos> Well, until your calendar clears up, just know... I'm gonna make my way through every friend, relative and associate you have.<eos> Let me save you some time.<eos> My friends and family don't know anything.<eos> Sooner or later, someone will.
Let's talk about more important things - are you pumped for tonight?<eos> This is not the new 90210 premiere. This is Scorsese.<eos> I am pumped indeed!<eos> Oh, a little heads up - the wife's probably not going to come.<eos> What?<eos> Why not? This is a couples thing. My wife is very excited.<eos> - As was I.<eos> - What's really going on with you?<eos> - What if your wife doesn't like Marlo?<eos> - Of course she will!
Don't be mad at me, OK?<eos> I don't know if I could take that right now.<eos> We used protection.<eos> He had a condom in his wallet that he said had been there since high school.<eos> It wasn't love, and it wasn't perfect or anything. But I'm glad I did it.<eos> I got it over with.<eos> - And I wanted to tell you first because I wanted you to know that you didn't fuck me up.<eos> My life is tough and weird and unpleasant sometimes, but I walk around knowing that I have parents who love me, who care about me, who always try their best, even if they screw up sometimes.<eos> I know I gave you a hard time when Mom was gone, but I hope you know that I love you, Dad.<eos> And I always will.
Stay.<eos> What's up, sweetie?<eos> We don't have to do what she says, you know.<eos> - What who says?<eos> - Her.<eos> The enemy. Your mom is not the enemy.<eos> She loves you.<eos> She wants what's best for you.<eos> Mom doesn't understand.<eos> She never will.
What's your point?<eos> God, for someone who loves women so much, you sure don't understand them very well.<eos> I know this seems all Bridges Of Madison County right now, but... It's really more of a rite of passage for you. Every comely college-age undergrad has an... an affair with her favourite middle-aged professor.<eos> Even my old lady had one, and it used to bum me out, but now I get it.<eos> It's like she was fucking me before she met me.<eos> Her ass is ringing.<eos> Here, will you hold this?<eos> I should take this somewhere else. Santa Monica, perhaps.<eos> - Tell her I said hi.<eos> - I will not.
I come here every three weeks, I get my medicine, and I don't have a brain tumor anymore.<eos> Charlie, if we admit you, if we do what you're asking us to do, the pain in your leg, there's no way of knowing if amputation will cure it.<eos> - But it might.<eos> - Yes, it might.<eos> - And once I get the prosthetic...<eos> - It will be months before I can even begin fitting you with a prosthetic.<eos> Which won't feel anything like a new leg, by the way.<eos> It'll feel like five pounds of metal that hurts and pinches.<eos> And what if the Army says no, what if they don't take you back?<eos> - They will.
- You create a website.<eos> - [Wedeck] Right.<eos> People can log on and post what they saw and cross-reference their visions.<eos> We can piggyback on that and search for patterns.<eos> I think that's what I was already doing. - What do you mean?<eos> - [Mark] Mosaic. All those leads I was running down.<eos> We should start following up on them now.<eos> Assuming your vision is even accurate, the investigation doesn't exist yet.<eos> But it could.<eos> It will.
Thank you.<eos> That's it?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You're giving up?<eos> I tell you he met a girl and moved away, and you're just gonna give up?<eos> You're Sam.<eos> Nina Sharp said you'd be coming by.<eos> Have the headaches started yet?<eos> No.<eos> They will.
Go over where?<eos> I was boiling water and tripped.<eos> This idiot tried to catch the pot.<eos> Burned himself good.<eos> - I'll take a look at it.<eos> - No.<eos> Nah.He's be fine.<eos> He just needs to think before he does stupid stuff.<eos> Okay.All right.<eos> I will.
- I'm doing the new Darabont movie.<eos> - Don't be afraid to get involved, Vince. - Oh no, I'm not.<eos> We're raising money for children all over the world.<eos> It's for kids.<eos> - It sounds good.<eos> - It is good.<eos> - You should look at it.<eos> - I will.<eos> - You can look at it too.<eos> - Yeah, I will, Matt.
His color is good.<eos> - He's not breathing.<eos> - He isn't breathing.<eos> Why isn't he breathing?<eos> What do you mean he's not breathing?<eos> It's OK. It's all right.<eos> What do you mean he's not breathing?<eos> You stay with him.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I will.
- He's not breathing.<eos> - He isn't breathing.<eos> Why isn't he breathing?<eos> What do you mean he's not breathing?<eos> It's OK. It's all right.<eos> What do you mean he's not breathing?<eos> You stay with him.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
I'd like you dead.<eos> So, you will be the assassin.<eos> isn't that logical?<eos> Don't we live by logic?<eos> Not your logic, not anymore.<eos> And your game, what you do to me here, won't stop me.<eos> Are you quite sure that it is a game?<eos> Yes, 'cause no one gets close to two<eos> Unless two wants them to.<eos> Well, perhaps he will.
The light's fading.<eos> Come on.<eos> It'll be back.<eos> And so will we.<eos> I still just can't believe my mom was gay.<eos> You know, that might not have been the word she would have used.<eos> I've counseled so many patients in her situation.<eos> Maybe if she just would have told us.<eos> It would have been hard, But we would have worked through it.<eos> You still will.
- Good luck to you, Drama.<eos> And tell that man of yours to keep his eyes pinned wide open cos I'm gonna be gunning for him.<eos> I will.<eos> All right, Lloyd, I'll sign with you.<eos> Yippie-ki-yay, motherfucker!<eos> - Calm down, Lloyd.<eos> - I can't.<eos> We're gonna make magic together, Johnny Drama.<eos> Let me just please get this show.<eos> You will.
I've accepted that.<eos> But if go in there and drag this guy out in front of 15 people, this whole under-the-radar thing is done.<eos> Now, come on, Gillian.<eos> I mean, we gave it a shot.<eos> It's time to call this thing in.<eos> Ben, n... no.<eos> What?<eos> There's one thing Matheson said today that I believe is absolutely true.<eos> If he sees the cops... he will pull the trigger.<eos> He will.
You go after what you want and you don't take no for an answer.<eos> What the...?<eos> !<eos> MAN: Sorry about that.<eos> You have a good arm.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right!<eos> I'm not going to let some college counselor, who wears an ankle bracelet under her stockings, get in my way.<eos> I just have to find a way to get into CU.<eos> And I will.
She has such a lovely mother.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nora, you've never told me. How did Justin and Rebecca meet?<eos> Holly, I smell your cake burning. So do I.<eos> Yes.<eos> In the kitchen.<eos> In the kitchen.<eos> I don't smell anything.<eos> You will, mother.<eos> You will.
Udders.<eos> "I'm sorry if I upset you.<eos> "Please give me another chance.<eos> "I would hate for my careless gesture<eos> "to spoil our fine romance... "<eos> It's the only one they had.<eos> Thank you, Monk.<eos> I realize how hard this must have been for you to have Natalie buy it for you.<eos> Okay, I bought it, but Mr. Monk paid for it.<eos> Or he will.
We can't touch him. Technically, there was no crime committed.<eos> But Mr. Greenblatt...<eos> Died of natural causes.<eos> There was no murder.<eos> No cash changed hands.<eos> I just talked to Agent Stone.<eos> The case is closed. I still don't understand.<eos> Why would the mob want to kill him?<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> Probably never will.
Her pressure's too low for general anesthesia.<eos> She won't survive.<eos> Then... we won't put her under general.<eos> Andthis goes through the nose to the base of the skull, and then I drill the bone off.<eos> Well, what happens once you drill the holes?<eos> We put miniature staple clips on the vessels.<eos> With what instrument?<eos> We don't have it.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But we will.

And I won't ever do it again. I promise.<eos> - It was a mistake.<eos> - I'm in a meeting.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> Hey, Mom, I'm at the place. - I ordered you a croissant.<eos> - Oh, thank you. - But I'm already on the road. - Oh.<eos> It's a long drive, I wanted to get... - No, I get it.<eos> - I can't leave your dad alone.<eos> - Yeah, tell Dad I said hi.<eos> - I will.
What kind of shadows are those?<eos> The ones they make from the parts that get left behind.<eos> Parts of what?<eos> People. Broken people.<eos> [Indistinct chatter]<eos> Be sure to let them cool a little.<eos> I will.<eos> And save your tin foil for the shinies.<eos> You, too, aunt Delia.<eos> Ok, honey, I will.
I'm tired of playing with him.<eos> You wanna see him?<eos> Come over by the car and I'll let you have a look.<eos> Come on. What do you say?<eos> I'll give you 30 bucks right now if you'll play with him in the car.<eos> Boomerang.<eos> You know, once I read over the transcript I could see how my words might have been misconstrued.<eos> Thanks for trying to help me, Dad.<eos> - Maybe we'll find me a friend tomorrow.<eos> - Yes, we will.
Here here?<eos> Like he's coming over to the table?<eos> Where would you suggest we do it?<eos> In the alley, with the cops and the cameras?<eos> I understand if you want to leave or, you know, go to a-another table.<eos> No.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Granny... why are your teeth so... big?<eos> What if they don't show up?<eos> They will.
How do you return coffee?<eos> Go.<eos> Any questions?<eos> PAM: (ON PHONE) Are you kidding me? Hi, Pam.<eos> Is Jim there?<eos> Listen, our credit card has been canceled and we have to deal with that. And I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here.<eos> Okay, that sounds good.<eos> I'll let you go.<eos> Just tell Jim that I said hi.<eos> I will. I will, Kevin.
Thanks, Ed.<eos> Which way is it?<eos> Oh, Jessica?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Happy New Year.<eos> Oh!<eos> Thank you.<eos> And remember, stay out of the file room.<eos> Right.<eos> No, I will. For sure.
What is?<eos> The killer's a woman.<eos> A woman?<eos> I'll let Morgan know.<eos> Karl, just now you said That this wasn't over for me.<eos> What did you mean by that?<eos> He's just getting warmed up.<eos> It's just...<eos> You don't see it.<eos> But you will.
Oh, my god.<eos> I can't stop it.<eos> I want to.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I can't stop it.<eos> You gotta help me.<eos> I know.<eos> I will.<eos> You gotta help me.<eos> I will.
Yes, she is. When she denies that she knows anything, she's lying.<eos> When she says she's sorry, she means it.<eos> She cares about Reynolds, but just not enough to tell the whole truth.<eos> We need to up the stakes on her, make it more clear how her actions are affecting Reynolds.<eos> How much pull you got with the Justice Department?<eos> - It depends, what are you asking for?<eos> - I need to call in a favor.<eos> I'm gonna take run at her.<eos> She's not gonna simply crack under pressure.<eos> Under the right kind of pressure, she will.
Hey. If you succeed, and you can get a signal to me, We'll shut down the mainframe.<eos> I guess I'm glad I never did kill you.<eos> Don't get sloppy.<eos> Here goes everything.<eos> ¶ what places we blindly pass ¶<eos> ¶ hurt me, you have to ¶<eos> ¶ that thought will never leave us ¶<eos> We got it. The information we were looking for, maybe more.<eos> I understand the mainframe. And I know how to get at the heart of rossum,<eos> Or at least someone who will.
You love me so much you couldn't let me go?<eos> Well, you weren't supposed to hear that, mother.<eos> I'm glad I did.<eos> I now have a witness if she ever tries to tell me how insufferable I am.<eos> I'm gonna go clear the table.<eos> Thank you, mother.<eos> So I take it you didn't tell him about your little trip this summer?<eos> No, and I'd like to keep it that way.<eos> When will you learn, my love, that some secrets can't stay hidden?<eos> Well, this one will.
But I've got plans. Sorry.<eos> Really? Someone I don't know about?<eos> You don't know about any of them.<eos> How's it going out there?<eos> Just about.<eos> It's looking good in here.<eos> All right.<eos> Turkey fryer is good to go.<eos> Oh, God. Be careful. I will.<eos> I will.
Sam?<eos> - Sam, you do not want to leave?<eos> - Ok?<eos> Sure!<eos> - Prepare to pack.<eos> - We go now, but I want you to promise ...<eos> - That if something bad happens ...<eos> - Mom, believe me, I promise, trust me.<eos> I do not want you just film I want you to leave here.<eos> I will.
You're right.<eos> Somebody might be.<eos> No.<eos> Ease the fuck back there, motherfucker.<eos> Look.<eos> Listen.<eos> I want you to take this money, take the kids and check into a hotel.<eos> Stay there till you hear from me.<eos> It's too dangerous for you now.<eos> I will.
What I said was "God exists, and he is American."<eos> Now, if you begin to feel an intense and crushing feeling of religious terror at the concept, don't be alarmed.<eos> That indicates only that you are still sane.<eos> It is Christmas, 1963.<eos> Janey tells me she is afraid and worried.<eos> She says I am like a god now.<eos> I tell her/ don't think there is a God.<eos> And if there is, I'm nothing like him.<eos> I tell her/ still want her.<eos> And that I always will.
You better look it from the plane.<eos> Osipov!<eos> Write up an order! Immediately.<eos> 2 groups, 12 people each... 2 groups are too many, Comrade Zhdanov.<eos> 3 groups, 12 people each!<eos> Under the command of Major Tolkunov... to immediately, underline it, immediately... begin foot search across the Lake.<eos> You have twenty-four hours.<eos> Not enough time! They won't make it alive!<eos> Out of three groups?<eos> Someone will.
Kevin, let me go.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Did you just say something?<eos> What did you just say?<eos> What did you say?<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> Why am I...<eos> Please...<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> I won't.
Did you just say something?<eos> What did you just say?<eos> What did you say?<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> Why am I...<eos> Please...<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> I won't.<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> I won't.
They should have grand titles.<eos> And might you tell the press what the film is about?<eos> Why?<eos> I still don't know what my last film was about.<eos> That was the problem.<eos> Nobody else did.<eos> Of course I can tell you what my film is about<eos> I can tell you the story, I can tell you... who I am going to cast, the music I want to use,<eos> I can tell you everything.<eos> But I won't.
- Signor Contini, please.<eos> No, no, it's an honest question.<eos> - Yes, I believe in God.<eos> - So do I.<eos> Are you a catholic?<eos> Yes, very much so.<eos> Not as much as I would like to be.<eos> Not as much as you would like me to be, I'm sure, but certainly yes, I'm trying.<eos> - Try harder.<eos> - Yes, I will.
Don't let her get me!<eos> Sorry.<eos> - How long will I be here?<eos> - Indefinitely.<eos> - Can I contact my parents?<eos> - No.<eos> - Derek?<eos> - Negative.<eos> - Do they know where I am?<eos> - No, and they never will!
Yeah. One of us will just have to change venues.<eos> Right.<eos> One of us could.<eos> Probably, um, not... the one of us who's been saving up for a decade, because she makes a pittance compared to the other one of us, but-<eos> True.<eos> I mean, or it would be, if the other one of us wasn't so desperate to get married at the Plaza... because the Plaza, practically, is the only happy memory she has of her childhood.<eos> So, oops. That's-Right.<eos> One of us will have to move her date.<eos> Yep.<eos> One of us will.
What are you going to do?<eos> Go and see him, no?<eos> I need to do something. - I've always wanted to be an actress.<eos> - And what about me?<eos> This is Magdalena Rivero.<eos> I want to cancel my massage tomorrow.<eos> I'll call you another time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> They still haven't given me the part.<eos> They will.
Of course we're interested.<eos> What? Who is it?<eos> You want us to audition for a movie?<eos> Where?<eos> Somebody wants the Cheetah Girls to audition for, like, a huge Hollywood musical.<eos> Definitely, we will be there.<eos> Okay, what's the movie about?<eos> Yeah, I don't remember, because I kind of lost my focus after the whole "Hollywood" part.<eos> - We have to get this.<eos> - We will.
What are you, a cop?<eos> I'm looking for the business.<eos> And no, no, you cannot pay me back on your meal card.<eos> I need cash.<eos> This is a business I'm running.<eos> I know it's your bar mitzvah money, but I have to take it.<eos> You lost the bet.<eos> Yes.<eos> I will take...<eos> Yes, I'll a check!
What's wrong with her?<eos> Bursitis.<eos> And what about the one next to her?<eos> There's nothing wrong with her.<eos> So, preventative?<eos> Just in case.<eos> No, is it true that the man in the red shirt just wants to be a better dancer?<eos> Um, what about you, Mr. Poole?<eos> Have you touched the wall yet?<eos> But you will.
Gasoline. I will spew gas down the stairs, until it reaches the trees.<eos> Want to get the fire zone? I'll burn.<eos> We will wait for help.<eos> It will not work. It will not burn everything.<eos> But there is a gas lighter accessories for the grill.<eos> You...<eos> Cracker.<eos> Hold... is something crazy.<eos> You know that fire comes back to us, right?<eos> I will.
What?<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Your 5:00 conference call.<eos> Cancel it.<eos> Can't you see I'm in a meeting?<eos> Go.<eos> What's going on with Charles?<eos> Does he know?<eos> Of course not and he never will.
Us?<eos> Try you.<eos> He's not killing me.<eos> Why is it getting harder to walk?<eos> Dude.<eos> That was lucky.<eos> So, have you killed anyone yet?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Well, you will.
Peyton is a bitch!<eos> Your mom's a bitch.<eos> What happened?<eos> She went to the recording studio and freaked out Mia,who is M.I.A.<eos> Imagine that.<eos> And now I don't have an artist.<eos> I'm sorry,Peyton.<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> Well,it's either that or my fist talks to her face,and that's gonna be a longer conversation.<eos> I will.
If you were to rescue them, I will do anything for you.<eos> - No!<eos> - Anything.<eos> And what does it mean, "do what we can"?<eos> We will send for everyone who is left alive.<eos> - And if there are hundreds, Tuvia?<eos> - Then we will provide.<eos> And when the Germans follow these hundreds?<eos> - I won't let that happen.<eos> - You won't?
What film was it made you have the fit?<eos> Ring of Bright Water?<eos> - The one about the otter.<eos> - Don't do that, Joe!<eos> - What?<eos> Put the empty bottle back in the fridge.<eos> - Do you still have 'em?<eos> - What? - Fits.<eos> - I haven't for a long time.<eos> Well, you will.
The point is, I wasn't so different from you.<eos> Only I was trying to get my parents' attention from a long ways away.<eos> So when did you... turn into you?<eos> When I realized they were never going to take me back home and that I'd have to make my own way, so I taught myself some discipline.<eos> and, em, all this brings back, well, me, at your age and how it was never the same with my mom once she dropped me off and drove away<eos> I'm sorry about what's happening between your father and me, but know... I'd love for you to stay with me.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I love you, and because I don't want to raise you by remote, hear about your day in a text message.<eos> I'll think about it, mom.<eos> I will.
like we wanna be with each other all the time.<eos> So what are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that,yes,I agree with you.<eos> It is a little weird that I'm so obsessed with this dog.<eos> Good.<eos> But it feels so great to be crazy about someone you just met.<eos> And frankly,I just.<eos> I don't think that we feel that way about each other.<eos> I don't know if I've ever felt that way about anyone.<eos> Well,you will.
Oh, Ami.<eos> I'm almost done.<eos> Thank you... for everything.<eos> I hope you'll stay friends with my wife.<eos> She can't have any more kids.<eos> I wasn't able to understand her pain.<eos> But, Ami...<eos> She was saved by meeting you.<eos> So please take good care of her.<eos> I will.
I kind of like it.<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> What are you, like, 16 years old?<eos> Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Look, Skyler I just haven't quite been myself lately.<eos> - I haven't been myself lately but I love you.<eos> Thanks for noticing.<eos> Nothing about that has changed.<eos> Nothing ever will.
I mean, surely, you've figured that out after all these years.<eos> What are you doing here, Gina?<eos> Just a little girl talk.<eos> Oh. Julia, what I neglected to tell you is the woman Christian's having the affair with is me.<eos> She's a dirty, whoring liar, and she's been in love with me for years.<eos> But are you sleeping with her, Christian?<eos> No.<eos> She's got the gate to hell between her legs.<eos> Why don't you tell your precious Julia where you were last night?<eos> OK. Fine. I will.
You want to taste?<eos> no !<eos> you are wrong !<eos> It's less strong by tasting that smelling...<eos> It's good , right?<eos> Oh !<eos> It is also strong inside !<eos> That's why we dip it in the coffee !<eos> That is sweeten.... come on, dip !<eos> No , I won't !
- Come on, that's enough.<eos> So, what's it gonna be, Rachel?<eos> If I agree to this, there is one thing I need.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You have gotten so handsome.<eos> You're a real little man.<eos> I'll bet you got all the girls chasing after you, huh?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> Well, you will.
Goodbye.<eos> So?<eos> Who's cheating on who? What?<eos> Don't play dumb, you rang at the detective's.<eos> I told you to stay in the car.<eos> - That's true, you did.<eos> - Well?<eos> Well, I do what I want.<eos> - I don't want to talk about it.<eos> - Then I will.
I guess I'll have to talk to them.<eos> And they seem pretty interested in you, so might be too risky to keep my mouth shut.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey. No need for that.<eos> How do the Seychelles sound to you?<eos> I got a bank out there who works with me.<eos> Fine. Sounds fine.<eos> I have one more loose end to tie before I move the money.<eos> Loose end?<eos> You said nobody else knew.<eos> They won't.
The physics of an explosion like this, it's beyond our comprehension. - Maybe it...<eos> - Made him disappear?<eos> Yeah, well, I'm gonna go try the base radio in the car.<eos> - What now?<eos> - We get the fuck out of here.<eos> You're not gonna get away with this.<eos> There's no sunset.<eos> Give me the fucking keys!<eos> If I don't?<eos> You will.
I feel anxious.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I was just talking to- to Michael.<eos> I want to make sure you'll be taken care of with the merger and all this.<eos> It's why I'm doing it, so you have a future.<eos> You'll have your health insurance.<eos> I appreciate that, Pop.<eos> I'm going swimming in the ocean with Polar Bear Club On New Year's day.<eos> Be careful out there.<eos> I will.
- I think I'm gonna cry.<eos> - Oh, it's okay.<eos> - Elliot?<eos> - Well, hello there, ladies.<eos> - Oh, hi, Ian.<eos> - Hello, Ian.<eos> Just want to inform you that the ceremony begins at 0800 hours.<eos> - Good to know.<eos> If it all goes according to plan...<eos> And it will.
Yes, sir.<eos> This way, Mr. FeeIy.<eos> Sergeant Del Arrazio says Maroni's guys are gunning for The Russian, lieutenant.<eos> He says it's going down in Tri-Corner, probably tonight.<eos> If you have a point, detective, I'm still waiting to hear it.<eos> Just wondering if now's the time to be acting courier for a vigilante, that's all, sir.<eos> It's called trust, detective.<eos> Something this city's had in short supply until very recently.<eos> But I don't trust him, sir.<eos> You will.
I'm free.<eos> - Free?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Free from all the drama with a capital Declan.<eos> Free from worrying about anybody else's feelings but my own.<eos> Free.<eos> Thank you for this.<eos> You're... welcome?<eos> Just make sure you and the kids stay close to the crowd.<eos> We will.
I'm not even going to ask why you're pimping me out for cheese.<eos> But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?<eos> Truthfully, I've never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.<eos> - What on earth are you talking about?<eos> - Let me explain.<eos> You see, I'm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.<eos> And what do you mean, "mediocre stock"?<eos> That would be you.<eos> But residing within you, is the potential for another me.<eos> Perhaps even taller, smarter, and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0, if you will.
The kind that leaves tracks.<eos> Those are gurney tracks from where the paramedics wheeled away Colonel Likkin.<eos> Those flattened treads that go from the batter back to the deep fryer are killer tracks --<eos> Yours.<eos> Those are hot-oil burns on your hands.<eos> Did the Colonel spatter when you deep-fat-fried him, you sick son of a bitch?<eos> Pixie dust and lemonade!<eos> You have no proof.<eos> That story will never hold up in court.<eos> This will.
and now that the weekend's over, I can tell you with what's happened, It's gonna end violently.<eos> We still got a chance to get out of this.<eos> After what you did?<eos> What chance? Hey! What you did, too.<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> Says who, huh?<eos> You?<eos> It's your word Against mine, bud.<eos> I just want this to end.<eos> It will, all right?
HE FOLLOWED THE CODE AND PURGED HIS OWN SON.<eos> UNTIL TODAY, I DID NOT KNOW THAT MY SON WAS ALIVE.<eos> WHY HAVE YOU NOT TOLD AURA THAT YOU'RE HER MOTHER?<eos> IT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH TO HER.<eos> WITH YOUR OWN LIFE IN PERIL, YOU SHOW SUCH CONCERN?<eos> SHE'S MY SISTER.<eos> THEN KNOW THAT, WHEN MING CAST ME OUT FOR BIRTHING A DEVIATE CHILD, HE FORCED ME TO TAKE A BLOOD OATH.<eos> IF I WERE TO EVER SPEAK OF IT TO AURA...<eos> YOU WOULD DIE? NO.<eos> SHE WILL.
I shouldn't have said that.<eos> I totally embarrassed you. No.<eos> Amanda... you can always say whatever you want with me.<eos> Glazed Cornish game hens on a bed of sautéed greens, sweet-potato soufflé and asparagus, with shaved Romano and pancetta.<eos> I don't think this is what we ordered.<eos> Right. 'Cause nothing says romance like a smoked turkey wrap.<eos> I took some liberties with the menu.<eos> You made this?<eos> No one knows I'm secretly a fan of Top Chef.<eos> And no one ever will.
I've got him!<eos> Malcolm!<eos> {\pos(192,190)}I've sedated him.<eos> {\pos(192,190)}He'll be out for at least a couple of hours.<eos> {\pos(192,190)}You know, you pass him on the street, you have no idea what he's capable of.<eos> {\pos(192,190)}{\Of course, }You could say that about almost anyone.<eos> {\pos(192,190)}Well, here's a reminder that he's not like anyone.<eos> {\pos(192,190)} - The gaps in the bone...<eos> - Hinges.<eos> Crumple zones, if you will.
What's the big deal?<eos> If it's not a big deal, why are you keeping it such a secret?<eos> You know. I'm not. It's just that I'm not kissing and telling all the time.<eos> How are you ever gonna get used to being single. ...if you keep running off to Hawaii?<eos> I'm not single.<eos> I have a boyfriend.<eos> He's your boyfriend now?<eos> Well, what about back here? There's lots of guys we could set you up with.<eos> You guys have never set me up, not once this whole year.<eos> We will now.
She knows exactly what you did back there,<eos> Why didn't take down stephen canfield When you had the chance.<eos> Nobody's talking to you.<eos> Claire finally sees you for what you are-a user.<eos> Isn't that right, claire?<eos> You used her to try to find that poor man.<eos> Then you used him to try to kill me<eos> Because to you... I'm nothing but a monster.<eos> He doesn't see our humanity, claire.<eos> He never will.
Terminal 4. Mr. Ventura.<eos> Can you take it, Fabio?<eos> Yes<eos> He wants to quit this time.<eos> He asked me to help.<eos> He'll be high again tomorrow.<eos> If he does manage to quit, what do we do?<eos> As planned, we give him an OD.<eos> - Will the police believe it?<eos> - Of course they will.
I promise it won't interfere with your day job.<eos> I mean, I don't know.<eos> You really thought I was good?<eos> I told you when I met you.<eos> You're a natural.<eos> Mr. Monk?<eos> Well, I...<eos> Why don't we think about it?<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
MOM SAYS SHE'S GETTING A MIGRAINE.<eos> SHE'S SEEING HER SHAPES AND SPOTS.<eos> YEAH, I THINK I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE. COME ON, HENRY.<eos> WE'RE GOING TO GO HELP HER OUT.<eos> BYE.<eos> BYE.<eos> YOU KNOW, I SHOULD JUST COME BACK LATER, MAYBE,<eos> 'CAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED TO GO AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR MOM.<eos> YEAH. COME BACK TOMORROW WHEN SHE'S FEELING BETTER. OK.<eos> I WILL.
- Four.<eos> Whoever threw the space heater in this tub knew that there was no GFI.<eos> Come on.<eos> Mrs. Baleman, what did your husband do for a living?<eos> He was a contractor.<eos> Well, if these autopsies prove they weren't suicides, then I need to inform the media right away.<eos> I would err on the side of caution.<eos> What?<eos> People need to know.<eos> And they will.
- With me.<eos> I worked for him.<eos> There's no chance you Photoshopped this?<eos> I can barely check my e-mail.<eos> Nate, years ago, your father foresaw me helping Eli.<eos> And, finally, I think this is my chance to.<eos> Give him more time.<eos> I'll wait 48 hours.<eos> - But if Eli doesn't wake up...<eos> - He will.
I was the only one that came back that day.<eos> For that, they gave me a Silver Star.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Here. I want you to have it.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Because we all knew the dangers that night, but we went anyway.<eos> That's the way it might be tonight.<eos> There's always a chance you don't come back.<eos> The hell we won't.
My father.<eos> Good man.<eos> Give him my regards.<eos> Can you get a cup of coffee for an old detective?<eos> Black, two sugars? You got it.<eos> Well, I see you traded up for somebody better lookin'.<eos> Actually, he's had a few partners since you.<eos> Doesn't matter how many you've had, You never forget your first, right, Johnny?<eos> It's true.<eos> I certainly won't.
I spent it.<eos> I'm sorry, Andy. I didn't want to shoot you.<eos> I was just trying to make a score.<eos> I didn't know you'd get there first.<eos> You really want to kill him?<eos> Go ahead, Andy.<eos> Now's your chance.<eos> You're never gonna answer for it. Not in this world.<eos> That's right.<eos> Didi will.
No, you haven't.<eos> Or she wouldn't be asking me these questions about paul eastman.<eos> There are ways to fix that if you'd let me.<eos> Where did i go wrong to make you hate your sister so much?<eos> You really need me to answer that?<eos> I have to go.<eos> You're on your own.<eos> Leave me alone, you hear me?<eos> I won't let you do this to me.<eos> I won't.
I did.<eos> That's fast.<eos> You seem underjoyed.<eos> No.<eos> No, there's a lot of joy here.<eos> It's... it's just a manager... It's a big decision to make alone.<eos> Wendy, i'm trusting my instincts here.<eos> She sounds great.<eos> I'm looking forward to meeting her.<eos> You will. Tonight.
- I believe you.<eos> You did nothing wrong.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> - I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I've got to do this.<eos> You have to tell him that I didn't do anything with those other guys. - I never did.<eos> I never did. I never did.<eos> - I will. I will.
- Look at that, Lafayette, theme shelves.<eos> - Oh, that's pretty, baby.<eos> Would you work for me tonight?<eos> No, ma'am, no, sir.<eos> I don't know any Cindy.<eos> But I can recommend the fried apple pie, the frozen Hawaiian pie the chocolate pecan praline pie, the chess pie, the seven-layer Jell-O pie.<eos> They'll have the peanut butter pie and the Spunky Hollow honey pineapple pie.<eos> - Please, Harley.<eos> - Gotcha, Buster.<eos> - We will?
Um, it won't cure the cancer, but it'll shut it off, which is almost as good.<eos> - That sounds really...<eos> - Crazy.<eos> Right, I know.<eos> Everyone says that, but it's not.<eos> If, if we can learn how to shut the bad cells off, That will lead us to a cure.<eos> And just so you know, I'm not gonna remember your birthday or National Assistants' Day.<eos> Not because I don't try or because I don't want to...<eos> Hold this, please.<eos> I just won't.
I just gotta say I'm really stoked to be working here.<eos> - That's great.<eos> - When does the HER-2 trial start?<eos> After we do the mouse protein test, which we're waiting for Genentech to approve.<eos> Mouse protein?<eos> HER-2 is a protein and they grow it in mice, because it's illegal to grow in humans.<eos> And mouse protein is the most like human tissue.<eos> So it adds another step, because they have to test to make sure it's safe.<eos> What if Genentech says you can't test it?<eos> They won't.
Fantastic<eos> Really?<eos> And when you sing it in your style, it'll be even better<eos> I just know it, man<eos> Thanks, brother<eos> Adi... when we meet the musiccompany guys, make sure you tell them about Debbie styling our music video<eos> You could tell them yourself<eos> Yeah, but she's my girlfriend and... it'll be a little odd<eos> You'll tell them, won't you?<eos> Of course, I will
Wow, a lot of people.<eos> Hey, everybody. Lieutenant Provenza, even you're here.<eos> Thank you for coming down.<eos> Anything you need, you know, just let us know.<eos> Are you hungry, sir?<eos> Did everybody get some pizza?<eos> Did you guys get some pizza?<eos> Because I ordered plenty of pizza.<eos> So please, make sure that you get some, sir.<eos> I will.
Yes, that too.<eos> Justin, you're a good person.<eos> You're honest and brave and kind.<eos> Look, I feel like Rebecca's only seen this one side of me and I'm terrified that if she sees this other side, that she's gonna...<eos> - She'll what?<eos> - She's gonna walk.<eos> She's gonna realize that I'm not good enough for her.<eos> You can't pick and choose the parts of yourself you want Rebecca to see and know.<eos> Shutting her out won't help the relationship.<eos> - What will?
An anonymous tip, couple of search warrants.<eos> Who knows what the police might find in your apartment or in that little boat of yours.<eos> You got the ring!<eos> I got City fucking Hall!<eos> I didn't get it before, Miguel, but you can't be reasoned with, guilted, controlled.<eos> This whole back-and-forth game for leverage is pointless.<eos> That's right!<eos> I'll do what I want, when I want, to whomever I want!<eos> Count on it!<eos> I will.
I'm done!<eos> Did you see anyone else on the street?<eos> There was some douchebag with his high beams on, blinding me.<eos> - What kind of car? - Dark, black, SUV.<eos> Think that's funny?<eos> Not at all.<eos> They said that stain would come out.<eos> I am the last person you wanna fuck with, because I will fuck you back!<eos> Count on it!<eos> I will.
What's Miguel Prado doing here?<eos> He is pulling his brother Ramon out of some deep doody.<eos> We bust him for kidnap and torture and he's just gonna walk right outta here.<eos> Fucker's lucky he's got an ADA in the family.<eos> It was an off-the-grid investigation.<eos> Is that what you call false imprisonment?<eos> I'm not gonna get railroaded for doing your department's job.<eos> Ramon, if you don't take this offer, you're looking at jail time here, OK?<eos> The prick isn't even pressing charges, Miguel.<eos> My detectives will!
I always do.<eos> I was just on the roof.<eos> It's flat terrain all around, but the woods are a problem.<eos> When it comes, that's where it'll come from.<eos> You're alone and exposed here.<eos> It's not good.<eos> And you're gonna tell me, "I know better."<eos> Bedell is quitting. Leaving school.<eos> No, he isn't.<eos> -He won't.
Right, but we couldn't find Fischer.<eos> They kept him hidden.<eos> He was too valuable.<eos> You really don't remember?<eos> Listen, if he is who you say he is he deserves whatever is gonna happen to him.<eos> But not until he tells us who he is and what he's doing here.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> -He is who I say he is.<eos> -I wanna hear him say it.<eos> He will.
did she comment or ask you anything about the details of your investigation?<eos> yeah, she did.<eos> she said you were a good man.<eos> and that was it?<eos> she offered me a job.<eos> and what did you say to that?<eos> "i acknowledge that by signing this document,<eos> "i waive my constitutional right against unreasonable search and seizure."<eos> i'm not signing this!<eos> i, however, will.
So, what?<eos> I don't have clearance to know background on a case I'm investigating?<eos> Agent Dunham, if I'm not always completely transparent with you there's a reason.<eos> This little task force you and I call our day job now it sometimes requires some, shall we say, bureaucratic maneuvering to keep it alive and free from meddling.<eos> Which means sometimes I don't tell you everything, for your own protection.<eos> With all due respect, that's not good enough.<eos> Now, I've been trained for a lot:<eos> Hostage crises, terror campaigns suicide bombers, chemical attacks but the things I've seen since I started working for you...<eos> If I'm gonna do this job, I need to know what it is I'm dealing with.<eos> And you will.
Get out. Everyone, get out!<eos> - Everyone okay?<eos> Somebody really wantsto keep secret whatever's insidethat suit.<eos> We've run closeto a hundred simulations based on full medical scans of the wraithwe've had in captivity.<eos> They've all been successful.<eos> We both knowvery well that computer simulations and live trialsare very different.<eos> I don't think we'redoing this cavalierly.<eos> I stand by the data.<eos> It will work.<eos> Perhaps it will.
You were sent here to evaluate my performance and make a recommendation based on your findings.<eos> The IOA may be leaning a certain way, but they have yet to make a decision on my fate.<eos> Yet you, their representative, clearly have,<eos> which leads me to assume something else is going on here.<eos> Someone in the IOA wants me gone and is using you to make sure that happens.<eos> Tell me, Xiao, what are you getting in return?<eos> It's my job, isn't it?<eos> They've promised you the Atlantis command if you help them get rid of me.<eos> This will all go a lot easier if you just accept where this is going...<eos> - The hell I will.
All right.<eos> Well, I was right.<eos> - They're all in their hibernation pods.<eos> - Where?<eos> There's several large chambers in the aft section of the hive.<eos> The weird thing is, though, if I'm reading this right, they haven't given themselves a wake-up call.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Well, the normal operating procedure would be to leave a few crew members awake so that they could monitor the pods and bring the others out when it's time, but since they all went in, I would assume there'd be some kind of an automatic or timed shut-down protocol, but I can't find one.<eos> So if we do not wake them...<eos> Then they never will.
And after realizing a far more important role on Colonel Sheppard's team, I never imagined the day would come when I would have to let it go.<eos> And now here that day is.<eos> Five years ago, if anyone had asked me if I ever planned on taking a job outside of the Milky Way, my answer would have been a definite no.<eos> And now...<eos> Look at me.<eos> So, while I can't empathize, I certainly do sympathize.<eos> Believe me, I know priorities change.<eos> And sometimes they don't.<eos> Teyla, I'm sure Kanaan will support you whatever decision you make.<eos> Yes. Of course he will.
The TV alone is worth two grand.<eos> Well, a last-minute plane ticket is expensive.<eos> Wait. Where are you?<eos> Somewhere in Spain.<eos> Gotta go.<eos> Slow song.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> It's Barney. So?<eos> For all the years Heather's been visiting New York, Ted's never let Barney meet her.<eos> And I never will.
It's good. Good coffee.<eos> - Quiet day, huh?<eos> - Yeah. Quiet week.<eos> Got a call from DiNozzo.<eos> - Tony?<eos> - When?<eos> Navy lieutenant did a half gainer off the USS Seahawk.<eos> Talk to his wife.<eos> Does she know?<eos> She will.
Ron!<eos> We searched everywhere. There's still no body.<eos> We got to keep looking, Eric.<eos> I'm with you, H, what do you want to do?<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> You and me?<eos> You and me, Eric.<eos> This never ends, does it?<eos> And it never will.
Why on Earth would I be happy?<eos> Everybody's here, together, for Thanksgiving, just the way you wanted it.<eos> Tommy, that's not fair.<eos> Well, then stop treating this like one of your dinner parties.<eos> I mean, this isn't another Walker family get-together.<eos> - Tommy, that's not what we're doing.<eos> - Just enjoy your dinner.<eos> Hey.<eos> I hope this works.<eos> It will.
They're gonna take one look, see a person old enough to be their...<eos> - Mother.<eos> - I was gonna say sister.<eos> Wow, I fell into that one.<eos> Sarah, it's your first job interview since school and you're nervous.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> - Yeah, well, I should be.<eos> I'm a mother of two with a mortgage and alimony payments.<eos> - I've gotta nail this interview, Tommy.<eos> - Sarah, you will.
Well, if he tries, just promise you'll call.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> I was sleeping so soundly.<eos> Peter didn't want to wake me.<eos> What's this?<eos> A cosmopolitan.<eos> That's your favorite, isn't it?<eos> It's 10:00 a.<eos> M. I don't want a drink.<eos> You will.
Get ready to start massaging his heart.<eos> Bailey, can you dissect any more?<eos> There's nothing to dissect.<eos> There's barely any artery left.<eos> What about if we extend the Gore-Tex graft?<eos> What's left is too friable.<eos> We can't reconnect the organs to the vessels?<eos> - Not at this moment.<eos> No. - But if we can't reconnect, they won't reperfuse and they'll die.<eos> - Yes, they will.
Just a little lower now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ahh.<eos> Perfect.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi,mama.<eos> What is this?<eos> I won't let youhop on the bed, so you're hoppingon the pop?<eos> It's fun. You should try it.<eos> Maybe I will.
- Yeah.<eos> Those are my pain pillsfor my back, and my back'sbeen in pain.<eos> - This bottle was fulla week ago.<eos> - I know.<eos> I've been takingtwo a day, which iswhat the prescription says.<eos> - But - - you know,contrary to popular belief, some people can take pills without turning into a junkie.<eos> I'm going back to bed.<eos> Look,if it makes youfeel any better, I could probably playthrough the pain, but those pillsreally seem to help.<eos> - I just want youto be careful.<eos> - I will.
- Saved by the bell.<eos> GIRL: Are you Dan Humphrey? SERENA:<eos> - Yeah, can I help you?<eos> - How could you do it?<eos> - What?<eos> Sorry, I don't...<eos> - Get back together with Serena.<eos> - She's just gonna lie to you again.<eos> - She doesn't respect you.<eos> - She never will.
That's what being grounded means.<eos> I wasn't doing anything wrong.<eos> I wasn't even drinking.<eos> Breathalyzer results?<eos> I made the cop who drove me home test me.<eos> I know I shouldn't have been using a fake ID,and I'm sorry.<eos> But you overreacted.<eos> I'll be the judge of that.<eos> I know you're dealing with a lot right now,but you don't have to worry about me.<eos> Thanks... but I will.
Good.<eos> Oh that's just not fair.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Oh you know what?<eos> It's dark in my room so I was just gonna crash early.<eos> All by myself.<eos> Well it's nice and bright in my room.<eos> Thought I'd do a little reading before bed.<eos> Maybe you should re-read your book And think about the comet and how close it is But you can't touch it 'cause you're stubborn.<eos> Maybe I will.
I got no girl, no love.<eos> - I got nothing.<eos> - Drama.<eos> When I came into this world I had nothing.<eos> Now I'm right back to it.<eos> I left everything I had up on that stage, except the clothes on my back.<eos> Maybe you should have left those, too.<eos> It would have been far more interesting.<eos> Maybe I should have.<eos> Maybe I will.
Think, maybe even before you pull out the fuck the pants next time.<eos> Do you like chicken?<eos> Or do you want another sausage?<eos> Hurry.<eos> Turn off those business!<eos> You can Finally here more 'late.<eos> And not 'what for you signed, right?<eos> I do not Andro 'now.<eos> If you're worried that I you think that the six date a raised legs when I was more 'need you... well, I do not think '.<eos> Si ', it will.
Why did you say that?<eos> - She was gonna find out at some point.<eos> - The doctor said to be gentle.<eos> Ah, doctors.<eos> Open your eyes, Nicole.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> I told you the truth because you can handle it.<eos> You have to.<eos> You will.
Nobody's allowed to see her right now.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Are they gone? - Yes.<eos> I'm not ready to see anyone yet.<eos> - You okay?<eos> You need me to get the nurse?<eos> - No.<eos> No, no.<eos> - Don't leave me alone.<eos> - I won't.
Like I could give him a name and...<eos> Relax.<eos> Everything's looking good.<eos> I'm falling behind in all of my classes.<eos> I had to quit my job at the Admissions office because I'm too tired.<eos> All I have is the financial aid.<eos> How am I supposed to do this after the baby's born?<eos> I wanna go to law school.<eos> You know, I wanna have a life.<eos> You will.
Isn't she the King's ward?<eos> Not that you'd know it.<eos> She's the only person I know who isn't frightened of him.<eos> It won't make any difference to Kanen that they're women.<eos> I know.<eos> But I couldn't talk them out of coming.<eos> I'm going to make him pay for what he did to you.<eos> Promise me you'll be careful.<eos> No-one can find out about you.<eos> They won't.
My Lady Angelica Fanshawe. The mistress of this house.<eos> Ah, my Lady Fanshawe.<eos> Master joliffe sits in the Parliament tending the nation's wounds.<eos> He is leaving.<eos> A delight to meet you, madam.<eos> And yet, I swear I have looked upon your face before.<eos> At court, perhaps?<eos> Of course. In the court.<eos> I never could forget such a face.<eos> And I never will.
That device has been discredited for years.<eos> Well, check their Web site.<eos> It's still used in 1400 state and local agencies.<eos> Well, not in Las Vegas.<eos> Or anywhere else in this state.<eos> Say, was an advocate or a parent present at the time of the confession ?<eos> He didn't ask for his mommy and daddy.<eos> Long as he says he understands his rights, we don't have to have anyone there with him.<eos> He tell you why he did it ?<eos> No, but he will.
- You think this is a game ?<eos> - Why did you shoot them ?<eos> - You're trying to get us killed ?<eos> - Why didn't you just let me go.<eos> - You don't know them.<eos> - And what were you gonna do ?<eos> Shoot me in the head ?<eos> Shoot and gone me like an animal ?<eos> I told you, I take you to New York.<eos> And I will.
Their aptitude for survival, is greater than... anything you could ever have imagined.<eos> Professor...<eos> your wife has found us... she should be here in two minutes.<eos> Find a door open, you're the only one who can save her now.<eos> So, where we going ?<eos> North.<eos> Hello my dear, it's lovely to see you.<eos> Where is my daughter ?<eos> I see you haven't found her.<eos> And you never will.
Outside.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Throw one.<eos> No, you're the injured party.<eos> You get the first punch.<eos> That's not bad.<eos> Now when I get up, I'm going to punch you back.<eos> I just want to say, stay away from my right knee.<eos> Watch my left shoulder.<eos> I will.
Yes?<eos> Caden asked me to give you this.<eos> You're to keep it in all the time.<eos> So touched by the sadness of Adele's neighbor so close to death.<eos> Say, "Thank you," to Adele's neighbor.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're very welcome, young lady.<eos> Now say, "Have a very good day."<eos> Have a very good day.<eos> I will indeed.
Abe?<eos> Red, I'm so sorry, but they're linked.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Red.<eos> - Liz.<eos> Red, behind you.<eos> You may have mused in the past, "Am I mortal?"<eos> You are now.<eos> Abraham, many people have died for this crown.<eos> He will, too.
Be a hero.<eos> It looks like you're planning a mass murder.<eos> Paper clip guy.<eos> I'm so happy that you and your boyfriend are spending Thanksgiving with us.<eos> Of course, Lucille.<eos> You need support at a time like this.<eos> Yes, I miss seeing my Albert each morning.<eos> You know, 50 years of marriage creates quite a bond.<eos> I wish I knew love like that.<eos> Oh, you will, dear.
Copy that.<eos> Eagle has arrived at the plaza.<eos> - Javier. - Yeah.<eos> Are you in position?<eos> - I'm on my way.<eos> - Good.<eos> For the moment, the Americans think they've dodged a bullet.<eos> Do not be late.<eos> - Don't worry about me.<eos> - I won't.
Kainan<eos> There's another one!<eos> Kainan!<eos> Everyone's leaving.<eos> Eric, it's not safe here anymore.<eos> Everyone's going to the boats.<eos> You need to go, too.<eos> But, I want to stay here with you.<eos> You'll come back soon.<eos> Everyone will.
It's $ 1100.<eos> This could be really good for us.<eos> I can make money selling homes.<eos> Enough that we can move out of the city, on a lake.<eos> - But Dallas isn't that bad, come on.<eos> - I know.<eos> There's a RealTops office in Marietta.<eos> When that brewery opens...<eos> But they haven't offered me the job yet.<eos> Yeah, but they will.
Like... whoopee.<eos> If you don't like your job, quit.<eos> If you don't like my work, fire me.<eos> You know, it's always more pleasant for everyone if you make the appearance of liking your job.<eos> I just conceptualized a commercial for pre-laid carpet.<eos> So just how excited would you like me to be?<eos> Okay, so you guys are at an amusement park, and you're all having a great time, roller coasters, cotton candy, the whole shibui.<eos> Except one of you has your period.<eos> Now, which one of you wants to have your period?<eos> - Oh, I will.
- Duct tape.<eos> - Yes, duct tape.<eos> I love duct tape.<eos> Besides, what was I in Inkheart?<eos> The Adderhead's henchman.<eos> Living in the woods with all those filthy beasts.<eos> But look at me now.<eos> I've got a castle.<eos> I'll never go back.<eos> None of us ever will.
-You cannot do this, No. 2!<eos> -Can, and will.<eos> -You brought this on yourself.<eos> -What are we supposed to do?<eos> You do what you took an oath to do and protect me, your captain, Four.<eos> Stay back, Four.<eos> I don't want to see anyone get hurt.<eos> You'll never get away with this, Two.<eos> The rest of the crew will not support you!<eos> Oh, yes, they will.
Afternoon, Allie.<eos> I must look awful.<eos> - You look lovely.<eos> Always do.<eos> - You're too kind, Everett.<eos> Virgil said you should pick out the curtains.<eos> Couldn't make up his mind.<eos> House is hurrying right along.<eos> Virgil ever decides to come and live in it.<eos> Pretty sure he will.
And besides, that, my friend, is not a dog. It's a goddamn horse.<eos> Well, let me know when you add a horse policy to the contract.<eos> Yes.<eos> Mr. Thomas, it's connie tepos.<eos> Hey, connie.<eos> I don't know why i'm calling you but i'm calling you.<eos> You said you could help us and... can you really help us?<eos> This just doesn't make any sense.<eos> - What if he finds us?<eos> - He won't.
But they don't think I'm the Lord.<eos> Why do you think people come here? 'Cause Disneyland's too smutty?<eos> I personally haven't been to the Holy Land, so this was an awesome experience for me when I walked on the property.<eos> - I was like, "Wow, this is cool."<eos> - Let me ask you questions - about your business... - Yes.<eos> Or really the Jesus business.<eos> God is super powerful. - He can do anything.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Why doesn't he just obliterate the devil and therefore get rid of evil in the world?<eos> - He will.
Doesn't love me at all.<eos> When's William get back?<eos> I keep writing. No word.<eos> Think he's dead?<eos> I'm still getting his pay.<eos> Army wouldn't pay a dead man.<eos> You'll have to stop singing.<eos> I'll sing if I want.<eos> They won't let you.<eos> Not pregnant, they won't.
I know what I have to do.<eos> I just don't know if my faith is strong enough.<eos> Tanthalas, please don't throw your life away.<eos> Come away with us, where you'll be safe.<eos> There comes a time when you have to risk your life for what you believe in.<eos> Leave with me, and we can finally be married.<eos> I'm sure my father would perform the...<eos> Your father once said I was half of one thing and all of nothing.<eos> DHe'll never agree to our marriage.<eos> dof course he will.
Twice a year.<eos> Can I have some paper towel?<eos> Max spilled yogurt on the couch.<eos> - OK, wait a second.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Give me a hand.<eos> Take out the cake.<eos> If Mom weren't here, would you still stay? Tend to the house?<eos> If you keep it.<eos> We will, for the children.
I couldn't stop till the next period, in Phys-ed.<eos> I want my life to be over.<eos> It's no fun being alive.<eos> But if I write that to Tobei, he'll just get worried.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Write what's on your mind.<eos> I'm sure Tobei will listen.<eos> After all, he's always been on your side.<eos> All right.<eos> I will.
Mom told me that I first.<eos> - Mom?<eos> What is the problem?<eos> Dad?<eos> Mom says you can come and get us.<eos> Move over, I'm so tired.<eos> I hate to sleep with you.<eos> When I'll have a house dad a bed just for me.<eos> Dad will never have a home.<eos> - Yes the will.
Will!<eos> Will!<eos> Connection lost.<eos> Connection lost.<eos> Will.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's all right.<eos> - We're gonna stay here till after dark.<eos> - No, no, they're gonna come after us.<eos> They won't.
I know.<eos> I know. So,any news?<eos> Well,I peed on one of those stick thingies,and it said yes.<eos> Angie,that is just the greatest news!<eos> That's just unbelievably great.<eos> Yeah,yeah.<eos> Thank yöu so much,Angie.<eos> If yöu need anything,anything at all,yöu let me know,okay?<eos> Yeah,okay.<eos> I will.
Do you understand?<eos> Well, little man, what are you waiting for?<eos> How about this one?<eos> Where's my mum?<eos> She's out.<eos> - When is she back?<eos> - Soon, I expect.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> - But I might bleed to death.<eos> - No, you won't.
Is that a suggestion?<eos> Politicians say it at the end of every speech as if it were some sort of verbal tick that they can't get rid of.<eos> "God bless you and God bless America. God bless you and God bless America."<eos> I guess they figure if they leave it out someone is gonna think they're bad Americans.<eos> Let me tell you a little secret about God, folks.<eos> God doesn't give a flying fuck about America, okay.<eos> He doesn't care.<eos> He never cared about this country.<eos> He never has.<eos> He never will.
She seemed so fragile.<eos> I didn't know how she might react.<eos> Monsieur Baker, Mademoiselle Norma is not her mother!<eos> Norma.<eos> If I told you I was in love with you, would you believe me?<eos> Sometimes... we see what isn't really there.<eos> Nothing happened between me and Frances.<eos> I have to show you something.<eos> Mademoiselle... I asked you to trust me.<eos> Will you?
- Will's in here.<eos> - And he wants to kill the Sheriff.<eos> - And the Sheriff has hired a poisoner.<eos> - Did you see Roger of Stoke? - Yeah.<eos> I gave him your letter.<eos> Good work.<eos> John, Allan, you go down that way.<eos> What do we do if he doesn't come quietly?<eos> - You make him.<eos> - What if he won't?
Oi, Much.<eos> Look!<eos> Much, meet Alice!<eos> - Put him down, Henry!<eos> - They say you don't kill any more.<eos> - For the King, I kill.<eos> - The King's finished.<eos> The Sheriff, Prince John and the Black Knights, they'll win.<eos> Robin...<eos> Not today, they won't.
You've lost your father.<eos> And that's why I want to get on with things.<eos> In time.<eos> In time.<eos> You should be resting.<eos> - Things to do.<eos> - What things?<eos> Stay here.<eos> Stay here.<eos> I will.
- Thomas.<eos> Thomas?<eos> Yes.<eos> This is for him.<eos> I've waited for this moment.<eos> I've imagined it so many different ways, meeting you.<eos> Killing you.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, I hope it lives up to expectation.<eos> It will.
They're both beautiful.<eos> They look just like the one crapping in my office.<eos> Did you tell Tracy he could use the crew to make a trailer for his crazy movie? - Yes.<eos> How's Floyd?<eos> - What?<eos> He's fine. I called him earlier.<eos> We had a nice chat.<eos> Did he mention that?<eos> - No, he didn't.<eos> - Oh, he will.
You're special, Ellen.<eos> But that'll only make the fall harder.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your ambition.<eos> Maybe we need people like Patty who see their destiny in grander terms than the rest of us. But that doesn't mean that you should go work for her.<eos> So think about it.<eos> My offer's still good.<eos> My interview is on wednesday.<eos> I haven't even gotten the job yet.<eos> You will.
I've been trying to figure out how to do that all night.<eos> - You haven't booked the suspect yet?<eos> - No. He's still in isolation.<eos> You know what, Chief?<eos> You have a lot to do still, what with having to look after these other two missing girls.<eos> Why don't I take Roger off your hands?<eos> Have Robbery /Homicide book him.<eos> I don't see how that's gonna help me.<eos> Oh, it will.<eos> It will.
Don't... Stop saying that;<eos> if we're gonna do one thing right... we're gonna do that;<eos> I want that corrected.<eos> You can't. Get out of my way. You can't.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Tom, I'll go.<eos> Leon Cushman's out there from the Post, okay?<eos> I have a relationship with him;<eos> I'll talk to him alone. Tell him to fix it.<eos> I will.
I want them to be right.<eos> - Well, let's hear them.<eos> - What?<eos> Now?<eos> Got a room full of women.<eos> Try 'em out on us.<eos> "Cristina, I could promise to hold you and to cherish you.<eos> I could promise to be there in sickness and in health.<eos> I could say, "Till death do us part. "'<eos> But I won't.
Unless?<eos> Unless you tell us something that we don't know that helps us find her.<eos> Well, she didn't get shot that night.<eos> We got lucky; the guy missed both of us.<eos> The worst thing that happened to Jen was she sprained her ankle when we ran.<eos> Are you sure your mother's not coming home?<eos> I told you, she's at work.<eos> She won't be home for another couple hours. / All right.<eos> You know, you should tell everybody that you, uh... - you twisted your ankle on a curb.<eos> - I will. All right.
-No, no, it's worse, worse.<eos> Uh, Anna's parents are in town, right?<eos> So I tell her, "I'd like to meet them." She goes, "Okay."<eos> What was I thinking?<eos> My own parents don't even like me.<eos> -We're similar.<eos> -Morgan, Morgan, relax, buddy.<eos> Just be yourself.<eos> That's what Anna likes, right?<eos> So will her parents.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> You-- you know what?<eos> You can have it I-if you want just as a token of my appreciation or whatever.<eos> It's... yours.<eos> It's a great watch.<eos> Don't let me catch you in this neighborhood ever again.<eos> - Ever.<eos> Ever.<eos> - Never again.<eos> You won't.
We got to find Gordon before somebody else does.<eos> But if it is a ghost...<eos> I'm getting the car.<eos> All I'm saying, if this is some spirit trying to correct a terrible wrong, then you need to confront it and tell it to move on.<eos> If I were a ghost, it would be hard for me to move on, too.<eos> I'm sure it would be.<eos> Keep the curtains closed and the windows locked for the rest of the night.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - I will.
- (PHONE RINGING)<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. Hang on a second.<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> All right, I'm probably gonna be home in, like, two hours.<eos> (WHISPERS) It's my boyfriend.<eos> - That steak was amazing.<eos> - Yeah, what do you season it with?<eos> (CHUCKLES) I'll never tell.<eos> Oh, come on. You'll tell me.<eos> No, seriously, I won't.
You know damn well what it was called.<eos> I guess I do.<eos> I keep thinking what it would be like to actually be one of those guys.<eos> Imagine if you were stuck in the past, just cut off from your friends and your family.<eos> That'd be quite a sacrifice, wouldn't it?<eos> They sound kind of like heroes to me.<eos> Well, heroes don't have people killed, They don't consume the personalities of innocent men and women.<eos> I don't know exactly what The Marked are up to.<eos> I haven't seen the movie.<eos> You never will now.

- Good for you, Larry.<eos> - I really don't. As a matter of fact, I hope you don't mind That I told a few people that you were the anonymous person.<eos> I hope that's okay that I let that slip out.<eos> Well, I can't really tell you what to do, but I- yeah... people should know you're anonymous.<eos> - You're a great guy, Larry-<eos> - Well, if you want to tell people go ahead.<eos> - You know, it's up to you.<eos> - I have already and I might continue.<eos> - Continue away.<eos> - All right, I will.
-What does that mean?<eos> -He's not talking, he's been on that phone for ten minutes.<eos> -What does it mean that -they scrambled the planes and sent in the helicopters?<eos> It means they know the prisoners are dead, -and they're gonna bomb the place.<eos> -Tom...<eos> -That's what it means, right?<eos> -Tom...<eos> That's what it means, right?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I will.
I didn't even know you were going to be there until you picked him up in the car.<eos> And look, I know how to use a gun, okay?<eos> I was so careful not to aim at you.<eos> And I came back! I came back to make sure that you were okay!<eos> I did!<eos> And you are, you know. You...<eos> You're okay.<eos> People need to know what he did to my dad.<eos> People need to know the truth.<eos> They will.
- Not yet.<eos> I have to.<eos> For Kevin's sake.<eos> Nathan, if something happens to me, I need you to take care of him.<eos> You know I would.<eos> And I want you to tell the DOD what's happening.<eos> No. No, not yet.<eos> One more hour, I'll know if this last trial worked.<eos> What if I don't make it through this?<eos> You will.
Did somebody do this?<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> He's in our heads.<eos> He's messing with our heads.<eos> Look, the real words are still here, it's... it's like he's transmitting.<eos> It's bleeding into everything.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Yeah? You want to tell that to the guy who switched off London?<eos> - Mr Freeman, you stay here.<eos> - Mr Syme, no, I won't.
Any Mock Turtles, wait in the wings till called.<eos> Well done! Well done! Both of you!<eos> Now...<eos> Pauline is to play Alice.<eos> And Winifred will be engaged as understudy.<eos> When I finished my dance, people clapped!<eos> Nobody clapped her. There was just silence!<eos> Dance is important, but Pauline looks right for Alice.<eos> She looks right for everything!<eos> She always will!
Well,you seem to have already made up your mind that I am.<eos> I told you you and i are just visiting.<eos> Right.<eos> Do you really want to know what I think?<eos> I think you chew your cuticles to punish yourself over what your hands have been doing.<eos> I think you hate your ex-wife.<eos> I think you want to kill her.<eos> But you can't because she's the mother of your daughter,so you find girls who remind you of her and you kill them instead.<eos> You stab them over and over,'cause they deserve it.<eos> If not now,they will sooner or later.
- Oh, Mama.<eos> It's always been our dream to retire and travel this great country in an RV.<eos> I can't say that a fugitive criminal was part of that dream, but I suppose that now is as good a time as any to get started.<eos> - Oh, we can't take your RV.<eos> - Why not?<eos> She's gassed up and ready to go.<eos> Besides that, it's comfortable.<eos> I don't think I can drive anything this big.<eos> - Don't worry, I'll drive.<eos> - The hell you will.
- Where are you going?<eos> You're not actually going to go through with this, are you?<eos> - Why wouldn't I?<eos> You're going to take a tip from this... this gabriel guy to go find your untrustworthy deadbeat dad?<eos> Your untrustworthy deadbeat dead dad?<eos> I'm simply following some leads.<eos> Leads?<eos> How?<eos> Think about this.<eos> I will.
Captain, nice to see you again.<eos> Gee, I wish I could say the same thing.<eos> That the shooter?<eos> - My god, it's Adrian Monk.<eos> - Not gonna happen.<eos> He is off limits.<eos> I just want to hear his side of it.<eos> Adrian Monk just shot Santa Claus.<eos> People are gonna want to know why.<eos> And they will.
I made a list.<eos> Did you check it twice?<eos> Adrian, you've got to stop blaming yourself.<eos> What happened on that roof is not your fault.<eos> If the man attacked you, then it's self defense.<eos> Nobody believes me.<eos> My word against Santa Claus.<eos> But you think it was the same man, this Mr. Kenworthy, who killed the woman in pacific heights last night.<eos> But you haven't told the authorities.<eos> I will.

- I want to do a job!<eos> - You'll do the next one!<eos> Don't touch that.<eos> Why are you drinking Rohypnol, Jen?<eos> Flunitrazepam...<eos> Yep, that's definitely Rohypnol.<eos> Do you have with insomnia?<eos> - That's nonsense.<eos> - Drink it, then.<eos> All right, I will.
Kira always brought out the worst in you.<eos> Hannah, they're going to put me away for the rest of my life.<eos> The evidence is against you, particularly given your history of violence.<eos> Please... after everything I've done for you, after everything we've done for each other,<eos> at least tell me why.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> And I love you, too.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.<eos> But you will.
Right, 'cause as long as you knew that he's fine, who cares about anything else.<eos> Here, look, let's go inside, all right?<eos> Why did you bring me here?<eos> Because I needed you to know the truth. About who I am...<eos> Oh, so it's about you now.<eos> Oh, come on, Rhonda, but...<eos> Well, what are you gonna do about Wallace? There's nothing<eos> I can do.<eos> 18 months I was in with your brother, okay and I still never got enough to put him away.<eos> And no one ever will.
Well how about I tell you a little secret about what you might get to do later tonight?<eos> The night before Lily met Marshall there was this party.<eos> You a freshwoman?<eos> I never use the word "freshman." Sexist.<eos> Yeah, I'm a first year.<eos> I'm in Hewitt 220.<eos> No way.<eos> Hewitt 110.<eos> You should totally come by.<eos> Maybe I will, Hewitt 110.
Look at me.<eos> Do you really think i'd rob a liquor store?<eos> No, but i didn't think you'd come armed to a black-tie fundraiser either.<eos> And people go to prison all the time for crimes they didn't commit.<eos> ? Going be ok<eos> How's zack?<eos> He's not great.<eos> Jack says he'll take him to the game.<eos> You have to tell him that you're not going, dan.<eos> I will.
Why aren't you saying anything?<eos> You once said you thought we could be friends.<eos> You know I have good in me.<eos> There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done.<eos> We'll never let you join us.<eos> You need to get out of here, now!<eos> I'm trying to explain that I'm not that person anymore.<eos> Either you leave, or we attack.<eos> If you won't accept me as a friend, then maybe you'll take me as a prisoner.<eos> No, we won't!
I just need to think through this on my own.<eos> I haven't done enough of that.<eos> Well, this is your home, Glen.<eos> There's always a place for you here.<eos> Good-bye, Professor.<eos> Bear in mind that you did sign a confidentiality agreement.<eos> - You can't talk about the work. - Yeah, I know that.<eos> The real world is nothing like the world of academia, Glen.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I will.
Parsifal,huh?<eos> If this parsifal has succeededin surviving all these years, he must bea master of deception.<eos> How can ipossibly help you?<eos> Barium meals.<eos> Barium meals?<eos> Yeah,it's a drink they giveyou when you go for an x-ray.<eos> It shows up anything thatmight be floating around-- yes,I-I know whata barium meal is, harvey,but how does it pertainto parsifal?<eos> I'm gonna sendeach of my suspects in the vishnevsky leaka juicy piece of information about an ongoingsecret operation.<eos> He'll think that thisoperation is being sent to many people alongthe pipeline.<eos> Yeah,but you'll just sendit to one person.
- Come on, hon. Let's go. - Oh, it's in the kitchen.<eos> Okay. - Yeah. - Your mom's so nice.<eos> I want you to distract my parents while I slip out and get these glasses to them, okay?<eos> - Ronald Wickity?<eos> - It's Witwicky.<eos> Who are you?<eos> We're the government.<eos> Sector Seven.<eos> - Never heard of it.<eos> - Never will.
Looks like Teresa's girdle!<eos> If I'm not mistaking this magnificent gem is nothing less than Esplaziana. The armor of the mythical knight Esplandium.<eos> You seem to know everything, Quixote!<eos> Everything is in the books!<eos> -Please, take this is a small sign of a Bachelor Carasco's commitment to our beloved hero. -What about me?<eos> Huh?<eos> Nothing, for me nothing!<eos> This is absurd, we can't go on like this!<eos> Pay me and we're even!<eos> -But of course I will!
It's your thing Do what you wanna do<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I can't tell you<eos> Who to sock it to<eos> It's your thing<eos> Do what you wanna do<eos> I can't tell you<eos> Who to sock it to<eos> If you want me to love you<eos> Maybe I will
FLEURY: Reminds me of when they hit the towers, first time, in '93.<eos> You remember how they caught the cell?<eos> -Car bomb.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> He went back to get his deposit on the rental car.<eos> $400.<eos> Stupidity.<eos> Then nine years later they come back.<eos> I got a feeling I'm coming back too.<eos> Yes, you will.
You don't know what the world is made of yet.<eos> I'm calling state police in five minutes.<eos> They'll be here in ten.<eos> Thought you would've done that by now.<eos> You know why you haven't?<eos> Because you think this might be an irreparable mistake.<eos> Because deep inside you, you know it doesn't matter what the rules say.<eos> When the lights go out and you ask yourself,<eos> "Is she better off here or better off there," you know the answer.<eos> And you always will.
Fuck no.<eos> Brother or not, he took my kid.<eos> Fuck Lionel.<eos> She could have been hurt.<eos> - What about Amanda?<eos> - What about Amanda?<eos> - Who's gonna watch her?<eos> - Dottie.<eos> Yeah, does Dottie know that?<eos> - She will in five minutes.
Are you fine?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm all better.<eos> Seriously.<eos> I mean, you know, can't you tell?<eos> Well, your ears got bigger.<eos> Yeah, I got weird ears. Well, just...<eos> Just think about going out with me again sometime.<eos> - Okay.<eos> No, I will, and...
- Why are you staring at me?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's like you escaped from a Hallmark card or something.<eos> Is that a bad thing?<eos> We're late!<eos> We've got to run!<eos> Oh, wouldn't she just love to come crawling back here and steal my crown!<eos> Cast me aside like so much royal rubbish! What?<eos> Perhaps Prince Edward won't find her.<eos> - Perhaps he will! - Oh! Oh, dear.
No.<eos> That's what's so cool.<eos> They all think it's just them.<eos> That maybe they're, like, going crazy or something, so they don't wanna admit it.<eos> Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they? No.<eos> It's real.<eos> It's really happening.<eos> Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?<eos> Something larger than themselves and they're not ready, are they to hear it?<eos> Yeah. But later they will.
What have you got there?<eos> Numbers?<eos> Here, when the time code duplicates a living thing, the copy is always doomed.<eos> And that includes flabby Jamaican pot-bellies.<eos> Kiss my front-butt.<eos> So my copy lived 12 years before Bender murdered him?<eos> Brutally murdered.<eos> I wonder what his life was like.<eos> I guess we'll never know.<eos> Or will we?
I had the chicken pox three times.<eos> I have no immunity to it.<eos> We don't have the heart to tell him it's herpes.<eos> It's not herpes if it's everywhere. Are you coming?<eos> You know, I'm all dressed, so I'll just hang out.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, I'll take a cab home.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be safe.<eos> I will.
Too weak even to argue.<eos> -You haven't slept.<eos> -Yes, I have.<eos> "Yes, I have." "Yes, I have."<eos> -Shit.<eos> -What?<eos> It's still recording.<eos> This is all set.<eos> You'll never get it through the door.<eos> Sure I will.
Oh, my God.<eos> How wonderful!<eos> Well, come in, Flash.<eos> Please make yourself at home.<eos> Flash, it's been a hundred years since I saw you last.<eos> Two hundred.<eos> That's a good idea, Mickey.<eos> It's colder than a well digger's rear in here.<eos> Yeah, y... You should turn up the heat.<eos> Yeah, I will.
All right?<eos> If I come back!<eos> Nanny, this is yours, is it not?<eos> Uh... no, I... no, I don't know what that is.<eos> It was in our laundry.<eos> It is not mine, it is not Mr. X's, so it has to be yours, right?<eos> Right?<eos> Yes, it's mine.<eos> Please don't leave your personal items lying around the house again.<eos> I... I won't.
Sean !<eos> Call an ambulance !<eos> I need an ambulance !<eos> You saw what they did to Sean.<eos> You know what that would have done to Jimmy.<eos> All I can do is talk to Sal and try and make him see that.<eos> But I need your word Jimmy isn't planning anything else.<eos> You got my word.<eos> Tell your mother Sean's in my prayers.<eos> I will.
You're different from when I first met you.<eos> It's funny.<eos> Crystal said the same thing to me.<eos> It's going to be five years this week.<eos> I know.<eos> She was my best friend.<eos> There's nothing you could have done, Stan.<eos> She was half dead when you found her.<eos> I am sure she forgives you.<eos> No, she won't.
- Daddy, what's happening?<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> It's...<eos> It's a blackout.<eos> The whole neighborhood's dark.<eos> Did you guys hear that sound?<eos> They're saying that it's blacked out half the state.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> They don't know what's caused it.<eos> No, well, they... They will.
I don't know.<eos> Just scared.<eos> You want to help me with this?<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure. Sure, I'll help you.<eos> Ooh, ooh. Sorry.<eos> It's all right, just... It's okay.<eos> Just got here and you're putting me to work.<eos> I think... I got it.<eos> No.<eos> Not yet. But you will.
Mitchell's accomplice is still at large.<eos> The police are appealing for anyone who may have been in the area... - Mr. Whitney. - ...to come forward.<eos> Gramms.<eos> Where you running off to?<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Yeah. Mrs. Jenkins down the block called. Asked if I could read Jane Eyre to her.<eos> Jane Eyre, is it?<eos> I told my gramms I was gonna read Jane Eyre... to this weird lady down the row.<eos> What if she finds out you're not?<eos> She won't.
Whatever's clever.<eos> It's all you.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> You know we can't do this forever, right?<eos> I know. Okay.<eos> It's just that I never actually thought about the reality of that, you know?<eos> Because I've been so happy.<eos> We have not been so happy.<eos> Look, the longer that we do this the harder it's gonna be when the inevitable eventually does come.<eos> Which it will.
Do you actually sleep on the boat? You can.<eos> It's very small, but, yes, you can.<eos> - So what do you do, Ian?<eos> - I'm in business.<eos> - Hotels in California. Come.<eos> Shall we dance? - Yes.<eos> Do you know what? Those two make such a beautiful couple.<eos> I think it's their duty to reproduce.<eos> Take me sailing.<eos> I will.
Um... well, you always said if I found something I wanted to devote myself to to come to you.<eos> - Ian's met this girl.<eos> - Let me tell it, Terry.<eos> I have a chance of coming in on a surefire business deal.<eos> Yeah, well, there's no such thing as a surefire deal, but go on.<eos> There's some partners want to invest in two hotels, in your neck of the woods, actually... in-in Los Angeles...<eos> - and naturally, this requires an outlay of funds. - Oh, yeah.<eos> Which, of course, you would get back with interest.<eos> If the hotels show a profit.<eos> They will, Uncle Howard. They will.
Of course I have, Rich.<eos> You know that, or you wouldn't be here.<eos> God, it's a lovely evening.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Absolutely gorgeous.<eos> Should be fine tomorrow, too, judging by the sunset.<eos> I should buy a house in the country.<eos> You really should.<eos> Yes.<eos> Maybe I will one day.
- She's gonna miss you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I wish I could take her with me.<eos> Maybe we should take one more ride together, what do you say?<eos> Come on.<eos> You better get before you hit traffic.<eos> - Be good.<eos> - Do I have to be?<eos> And give Kate and Sam kisses from me.<eos> Yes, I will.
- He's good. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Right, I'm sure he's good enough for y'all.<eos> My grandma would be good enough for them.<eos> - Ha! You'll see.<eos> - Good luck with that.<eos> Oh, and don't worry.<eos> I'll let y'all take pictures with our trophy.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Your trophy...<eos> We will.
~ You love them so<eos> ~ I won't... ~ Betray his trust<eos> ~ Though people say I must<eos> ~ I've got to stay true to... ~ As long as he needs me<eos> Then he's like, "I'm straight, remember?"<eos> Suddenly stricken with some sort of gay panic.<eos> "I'm your straight husband."<eos> - You can throw colour swatches at me.<eos> - I know.<eos> Oh, I will.
I thought you knew.<eos> No, I did.<eos> I did.<eos> I just wasn't sure.<eos> All right.<eos> Well do you want to stay and have a glass of wine or chai?<eos> I have to get going.<eos> But thanks anyway.<eos> -Say hi to Harold for me, Beth, okay?<eos> -I will.
I went to the municipal police, the provincial police... the what's it called... the Department of Justice.<eos> No one knows anything.<eos> No one talks.<eos> - Since the 9/1 1 attacks, Security Services can hold suspected terrorists indefinitely.<eos> - He's not a terrorist.<eos> - He's an Arab.<eos> - He's a cook!<eos> - A German cook wouldn't have this problem.<eos> - l don't know what he's accused of.<eos> - You never will.
I need you to find someone.<eos> Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You got it?<eos> I got it.<eos> Man, this is hard to spell.<eos> Swagger is going to go with what he knows.<eos> He'll try to track the shooter.<eos> He won't get far that way.<eos> Yes, he will.
- You could help.<eos> - Sorry. Busy.<eos> - Oh yeah?<eos> Doing what? - Busy smoking my fag.<eos> - Give us a puff.<eos> - No way.<eos> - Go on.<eos> - No.<eos> - What if your dad finds out?<eos> - He won't.
This... this is my friend Ray.<eos> "Man 2."<eos> I don't really follow the acting or the story ever.<eos> Uh, are you based here, New York, LA?<eos> - Uh, New York, actually.<eos> But I do work out of LA quite often.<eos> Well, if you're there on a permanent basis,<eos> - call me up.<eos> - I will do.<eos> Yeah, I definitely will.
I will take back what is mine.<eos> Knut...<eos> I can understand if you don't want to get involved, but I can't stop thinking of Cecilia.<eos> Cecilia Algots-daughter.<eos> She is promised to someone else.<eos> I will be king.<eos> If I can count on your support, you can count on me.<eos> - How do you know that he will come?<eos> - He will, I am sure.<eos> He will.
But you will not stay here at Varnhem.<eos> I have written to the bishop, and he has agreed to our request.<eos> Under the name of "Arn de Gothia" you will journey first to Rome and from there to the Holy Land.<eos> - Father, I...<eos> - You will be a Knight Templar, Arn.<eos> A soldier in the service of God.<eos> Take good care of Chamsiin.<eos> You sit here daydreaming again?<eos> Do you still think that your lover will come to pick you up?<eos> He will not.
I always go to the place in the woods.<eos> That was her place.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss, Tory.<eos> If there's anything I can do, be sure to call.<eos> I will. Thank you.<eos> You know, Hope loved marigolds and they're growing crazy at Beaux Reves.<eos> Do you wanna pick some and meet me up there about 2?<eos> And we can tell her it's all over.<eos> Faith, I wish I felt that way.<eos> You will, you will in time.
I'm not going to be forced from my position by a handful of young turks who don't know cutting-edge from cutting farts.<eos> Your colleagues didn't send you here.<eos> Then who did?<eos> I envy you, Mr. Havelmann.<eos> - You don't even know me.<eos> - You never have to grow old.<eos> You never have to watch your friends die.<eos> You can still enjoy the music you love, the pleasures of a good meal, good sex.<eos> - You'll always be 41 years old.<eos> - Not in 4 months, I won't.
Help me if you can.<eos> I can only tell you what I went through...<eos> And I've never told anyone.<eos> After your birth, I felt an unknown attraction to another woman.<eos> I was ready to leave my family.<eos> But before doing that, I forced myself to stop seeing her.<eos> Soon enough, I realised the excitement existed only in myself.<eos> It was my need to feel.<eos> You suffer, because you think the pain of losing her will never pass...<eos> But it will, Son.
- Hey, you know, if it was anybody else...<eos> - No, no, I understand.<eos> - Yeah, next week, I'm 100% there.<eos> - You promise?<eos> - Yeah, and it's still early, so I'm sure you'll find someone else to go with you.<eos> Oh, you can bet on that.<eos> Well, tell Katie I said hello.<eos> Will do.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> I will.
You'll need your strength to face them.<eos> I had my chance.<eos> Then forgive me.<eos> No!<eos> What have you done?<eos> I saved your life.<eos> You never listened to me, did you?<eos> By doing that, you've probably just exhausted half your strength, not to mention the fact you've now exposed our presence to the Fallen.<eos> - My strength will come back.<eos> - No, it won't.
I believe the Terrian must have reprogrammed my robot during our captivity.<eos> Like you said, interesting species.<eos> Full of surprises.<eos> We've got a few surprises up our sleeve, too.<eos> You're on the terraforming campaign, Lieutenant.<eos> - That's an order.<eos> - Sir!<eos> I don't know what happened to you on Terra, but this is war, and I'd feel a lot better knowing you had my back.<eos> I've always looked out for you, kid.<eos> I always will.
- You're cleared.<eos> - They want it formatted to military specs.<eos> I'm coordinating an assault with Cobra helicopters.<eos> - When?<eos> - 30 minutes.<eos> - But assault on who?<eos> - Assad.<eos> What?<eos> We don't know where Assad is.<eos> - We will.
So, what you're gonna do is you're gonna take him out of this room and you're gonna stitch him up now.<eos> Nothing, huh?<eos> Dave.<eos> Dave, watch out!<eos> Dave!<eos> Dave.<eos> Dave, get up.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Have a good night, chief.<eos> I will.
I offered.<eos> He doesn't want us to.<eos> He said he would stay in touch. Let us know what he learns.<eos> You don't really believe that.<eos> My father says the sticks honor those who died.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Do you know who did this?<eos> Yes.<eos> My father says they are cowards. They must pay with their lives.<eos> They will.
This is the future of our people.<eos> Lower your weapons.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is Colonel Mitchell.<eos> SG1 is returning a little early.<eos> Transmitting iris code now.<eos> It's true.<eos> Everything they said was true.<eos> - I don't believe it.<eos> - And neither will anyone else.
- Thanks, that's encouraging.<eos> We just have to trust each other.<eos> I can do that.<eos> So I'm gonna give you one more freebie.<eos> What am I thinking?<eos> We're having a baby?<eos> We're having a baby!<eos> Nik, what have they done to you?<eos> - If they catch you...<eos> - They won't.
Test results are back for your STD patients.<eos> I'm not paying you for them.<eos> You already touched them.<eos> How old are you?<eos> 30.<eos> And you've never seen an after-school special?<eos> Dawson's Creek?<eos> How do you get to 30 and not know about condoms?<eos> Oh, God. I have an STD.<eos> No. But you will.
I wish we hadn't gotten pregnant so soon.<eos> I wish we'd had more time at the beginning.<eos> Are you still attracted to me?<eos> Honey.<eos> Yes.<eos> Have you ever had an affair?<eos> Uh, don't answer that.<eos> Never.<eos> Never have.<eos> Never will.
Good.<eos> Tried calling you a couple of times.<eos> Crazy day.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Everything was late, and those guys just don't want to work.<eos> It's pretty much a wasted day.<eos> But I bought a suit.<eos> What, right around 11:00?<eos> Buy me anything?<eos> No, but I will.
- He does?<eos> - He does.<eos> And will he lend it?<eos> I don't think so, because he's very attached to it.<eos> - But he can shoot.<eos> - What? Can he?<eos> Yes, he does some effects.<eos> It gets a bit dark, but...<eos> - Talk to him, Silene, please.<eos> - I will.
I bought it in São Paulo.<eos> - I knew it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Silene?<eos> Hi, it's me.<eos> Silene, where are you?<eos> At the salon?<eos> Are you gonna straighten it?<eos> Have you cut it?<eos> You will!
She's heavily sedated.<eos> And this time I know exactly what I'm dealing with.<eos> You?<eos> I was caught off guard the first time.<eos> That will not happen again.<eos> It does not matter.<eos> Well, we think it does.<eos> Your fate is sealed.<eos> If you have any reason to suspect that I am not myself, do not hesitate to use that.<eos> I won't.
All my clients have their tactics.<eos> But hers was... insane.<eos> She wasn't lying to you, Jesse.<eos> You have 13 alleles in common.<eos> You killed your mother.<eos> Then take me to jail.<eos> You know, call me a killer... a murderer, whatever,<eos> but don't tell me I have a mother... because I don't.<eos> I never did.<eos> And I never will.
No.<eos> -Hey.<eos> -Hi.<eos> Henri-Michel's gone.<eos> He's gone?<eos> Gone where?<eos> Back to France, I guess.<eos> Why?<eos> I think he understood even better than I did that as much as he loved me, I didn't love him.<eos> And I probably never will.
- Haley!<eos> There's no reason to expect that this baby won't be perfectly healthy.<eos> I'm having money problems, Dad.<eos> It's serious and I need your help.<eos> You're not an investment I'm interested in.<eos> When I was unconscious, I saw Keith.<eos> This is where I was murdered, Luke.<eos> I still don't believe that Jimmy killed you, Keith.<eos> You still can't see it, can you?<eos> You will.
What is it?<eos> It's a coffin.<eos> Hotch, there's another coffin over here.<eos> It's ok. Don't try to speak.<eos> We've got you.<eos> Thank god.<eos> One is perfection.<eos> Two is decadent.<eos> You take another step, and i will shoot you.<eos> No, you won't.
No, I'm fine thanks.<eos> No, I'm fine thanks. Get in the car.<eos> Go.<eos> KNOCK AT DOOR Occupied.<eos> Sorry, couldn't wait.<eos> It's OK.<eos> You all right?<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> Stan'll come around.<eos> No, he won't.
I don't know, improvise.<eos> Go on, we've got to stash the car.<eos> Come on, what are you waiting for?<eos> Oh, I had such a lovely dream...<eos> Get it out.<eos> We can at least some spliffs before you're taken out and debollocked.<eos> Oh, nice. Thanks Tone.<eos> Relax. We'll sell it tomorrow.<eos> Where?<eos> We just will.
I mean, yeah, of course.<eos> And you're supposed to respect women's bodies, Muslim boy.<eos> I'm respecting.<eos> Believe me, I'm respecting.<eos> I mean, what's keeping it all up?<eos> Don't touch.<eos> But I wanna touch.<eos> Honestly, I'll die if I don't touch.<eos> So who's buying us a drink?<eos> - I will.
- So, it's not like I did it on purpose.<eos> - Uh-huh. - The thought didn't even enter my mind.<eos> It's not like it entered my mind and I thought "No, the hell with them. "<eos> See the difference?<eos> Sin of comission, omission.<eos> That's a sin of omission, much better than the comission.<eos> I think it's an omission/comission thing.<eos> But you still forgot about us.<eos> So next time, just bring like the family-order size...<eos> - I will.
Would you like to come inside for a drink of coffee?<eos> Listen you left a message on my machine; you said you needed to talk about Mina, but I don't have a lot of time, so...<eos> I know you've talked with the police and the FBI...<eos> Yeah, so what, what are you gonna do?<eos> You gonna go through the same line of questioning a third time?<eos> Thank you, but no.<eos> You feel it, don't you?<eos> There's something going on here about Mina's death.<eos> Things you're not sure you can talk about with the police and FBI, because you don't think they'll believe you.<eos> I will.
The war's a bummer, huh?<eos> It used to be money in the bank.<eos> You're the one having this argument right now, not me.<eos> I'm the one saying go produce your show.<eos> I'm the one throwing my body in front of Jack.<eos> -We've averaged a 5-7/19 over...<eos> -Over five months.<eos> Over two it's a 4-8 and the half-hours are simply unacceptable.<eos> -Then we need to talk about this.<eos> -We will.
Daddy, look!<eos> They're bloody animals.<eos> Animals!<eos> I'm going to kill them!<eos> Try to remember what your behavioural therapist said. Run along.<eos> We've entered bedlam.<eos> The very gates of hell.<eos> I don't understand why you didn't close this place years ago.<eos> Because, Miss Bagstock, they can change.<eos> And they will.
What's he talking about?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He must be hallucinating.<eos> He seemed fairly lucid to me.<eos> You know, you look really beautiful.<eos> You're delirious.<eos> Have dinner with me.<eos> We'll talk about it when you're better.<eos> I can't wait that long.<eos> Of course I will.
You and the Director have a nice chat?<eos> Well, I wouldn't call it "nice".<eos> Illuminating, perhaps.<eos> - For who?<eos> - Well, not for her.<eos> As you expected, she didn't... appreciate my thoughts on La Grenouille.<eos> She still thinks of him as a prime suspect.<eos> - So do I.<eos> - Yes, but you listen to my perspective, and I have no doubt that your mind would change if the facts were to change.<eos> And the Director's won't?
A love contract.<eos> Basically, it's a document... to limit our liability when good relationships go bad.<eos> - More and more corporations are using them... as sexual harassment shields.<eos> You and Denise are romantically or physically involved... which is very nice. But should it turn ugly, we need to protect ourselves.<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> Brad, I know it's silly... - but it's policy.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> The policy is dumb, and I won't sign it.<eos> - You have to sign.<eos> - I won't.
- That and we're out of money.<eos> - Oh, there's that.<eos> Are you?<eos> You know they charge up to $30 for a bowl of penne? Vince wants a job, Ari.<eos> Tell us what you got.<eos> - I gotta see the movie.<eos> - Not gonna happen.<eos> Walsh won't even let Rubinstein see it.<eos> He understands that at some point everyone's gonna need to see it, right?<eos> At some point, everyone will.
We both made decisions that we had to, to accomplish our missions.<eos> Cain, Kendra.<eos> Were they wrong?<eos> Well, if I believed in the Gods, I'd say they'd be judged by a higher power.<eos> But since you don't believe?<eos> Then history will have to make its judgments.<eos> And since history's first draft will be written in our logs...<eos> Well, then I guess I've got some writing to do.<eos> Think about that commendation.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Let us out, please!<eos> We can't breathe. And we need to use the bathroom.<eos> Please.<eos> I--I screwed up again, bro.<eos> Put on your poker face.<eos> Don't let anyone see she got to you.<eos> We're trash, bro.<eos> Okay?<eos> Low life grunts. we have no place in her world.<eos> We never will.
Whistler got a note out on a dead body yesterday.<eos> I don't know what it means or who it's for.<eos> But we need all the leverage we can get, and, uh...<eos> I need some money.<eos> No one's ever broken out of this place before, let alone with a week to plan it, so... you tell these people, whoever it is that took Sara and my nephew... you tell them I get it,<eos> I'm going to break this guy out of here, or I'm going to die trying.<eos> And if it's the latter, then that should count for something, right?<eos> That's got to count for something.<eos> You tell them that.<eos> - I will.
Raghu !<eos> He goes after that one and... Mr. Nath !<eos> Mr. Nath !<eos> Have you seen my Murari uncle?<eos> No.<eos> When he comes, ask him to come home.<eos> The bucket has fallen in the well, it has to be taken out.<eos> Okay, I will tell him.<eos> Don't forget it.<eos> - I won't.
Why didn't you let me know?<eos> I left a hundred messages.<eos> I know but my phone is... out of order.<eos> I'm going to the paper. I've taken half a day off work.<eos> Let's do it now.<eos> I can't!<eos> Give me the keys.<eos> The place is a mess.<eos> - Put them in the mailbox. - I won't snoop.<eos> Of course you will.
Yeah, except for you not letting me stay up late.<eos> Well, you make sure and tell Dr. Gelman that.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> Anna Miller?<eos> You ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, have fun.<eos> Tell the truth.<eos> Okay, yeah, I will.
Then they left town, I guess.<eos> And nobody tried to pin the cave-in on them?<eos> Now, why would they try to do that?<eos> Well, from my experience...<eos> The best scapegoats are those... who can't speak English.<eos> You know, that's all ancient history.<eos> But they've been finding some damn strange stuff... down in that hole... in the last couple of weeks.<eos> Carvings and such.<eos> I think... something came out of that mine. Something that... never died.<eos> And never will.
I'm not scared.<eos> You're scared.<eos> Schrader, you were scared to try the new flavor of Dr. Pepper.<eos> I told you that in confidence, Hands.<eos> Schrader, you were afraid when your tooth fell out because you were terrified of the tooth fairy.<eos> That's actually a legitimate fear.<eos> She was rifling through my shit.<eos> Okay, Fine, whatever, dude, stay here.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will.
This unites us forever.<eos> Now you'll never be free of me.<eos> I would die for you.<eos> Some day you may.<eos> Inigo.<eos> You must be careful.<eos> For a man, a woman's beauty always ends in tyranny for a man.<eos> 'Tis the law of life.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> You will.
Everybody, go back to your seats.<eos> Or I kill myself, and I swear to God...<eos> I'll do it.<eos> We have to let go.<eos> I can't.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> But the truck will fall, and we'll both die.<eos> Let me go, or I'll pull this fucking trigger! - No, you won't.<eos> - I swear to God I'll do it!<eos> No, you won't.
What do you want?<eos> Leave me! Leave me alone!<eos> Please, please.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> Will you deliver Spain from bondage?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> I don't know how.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.
If I what?<eos> You'd just ignore it, you'd act like it never happened?<eos> How could you do that?<eos> We don't look back in radio.<eos> That's the beauty of it.<eos> Nobody gets old.<eos> Nobody dies.<eos> We just keep on goin'.<eos> What if you died?<eos> I will.
Morty told me about the woman in Chinatown... and about the Journal.<eos> I've seen you writing in it.<eos> If you really loved me, no matter what I did, no matter what we were going through, you would not have done what you did.<eos> Okay, you're right.<eos> I'm human.<eos> I'm flawed.<eos> I'm a flawed piece of shit, Jack.<eos> Is that what you want to hear?<eos> Do you want to hear me beg?<eos> 'Cause I will.
I think you're running out of time, you know?<eos> No, you're the one running out of time.<eos> I read once that a third of women study psychology to work out their own personal problems.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Tell me about Nigel.<eos> Well, Nigel got what he wanted.<eos> And what was that?<eos> Eternity.<eos> Oh, you don't get it, do you?<eos> You will.
Pray for yourself.<eos> We're one now.<eos> What follows through a system of either intimidation, manipulation, or coercion, is the dominant individual begins to focus and influence the thoughts of the subordinate partner.<eos> This process nurtures a subjective gestalt where similar thoughts, fantasies, and other interlocking elements conspire to form a greater and more volatile hold, therefore a merging of like minds.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The head's missing.<eos> Nigel got what he wanted. And what was that?<eos> Eternity.<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> You will.
- You're our son...<eos> - I don't wanna talk about it!<eos> We're here for you. Son!<eos> Son, your mom and I are very concerned about you.<eos> You're the pent-up type.<eos> You've got to get in touch with your emotions.<eos> Go away!<eos> - It's beautiful.<eos> - It won't work.<eos> - Of course it will.
They couldn't find Cory and Trevor;<eos> if I don't work, I'm getting fired.<eos> And we need the money, you know that.<eos> Lucy, come here.<eos> Look, I'll only gonna be working for a couple hours.<eos> I'll stop and get a big bucket of chicken, go to the liquor store, get some great hash.<eos> We'll get drunk, smoke some dope, and we'll bang tonight, listening to April Wine.<eos> - Getting chicken and banging, that's nice.<eos> Fine. Be careful.<eos> - I will.
Well, of course they do.<eos> There are no hard copies to these blueprints.<eos> - Absolutely no one has access.<eos> - Good. The software is all hardwired so they come up only on this unit.<eos> Try to copy, delete, print or transfer any of them... they auto encrypt hundred two-fifty six-bit key.<eos> The vault itself is opened only with... two magnetic strip keys... and a corresponding off site security code... which changes every six minutes.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Clearly, your client's money is in very, very good hands, Mr. Malik.<eos> Indeed. I mean, these guys would be crazy to even try.<eos> They won't.
So you're, like, getting married, too.<eos> That is just so... Yeah.<eos> Does your fiancée do things for you?<eos> Like?<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she's amazing.<eos> But does she do the... naughty things?<eos> - We really appreciate the ride.<eos> - Oh, you will.
She tried to stop the bleeding.<eos> Oh, she's cut deep.<eos> We ought to take away her pain.<eos> You gonna shoot her?<eos> What do you think?<eos> How bad's the horse?<eos> Go back and put her down.<eos> She'll hear the shot.<eos> She'll think it's thunder.<eos> No, she won't.
Does it show?<eos> You know, it's Saturday, you're wearing a suit and...<eos> I've got to go in.<eos> I've got a lot on my plate.<eos> I just found out I'm up for partner.<eos> Partner, huh?<eos> Wow, that's quite an achievement.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Well, it hasn't happened yet.<eos> It will.
Is she resting?<eos> Need a break?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> I love my mother.<eos> Maybe I do need a break sometimes.<eos> You shouldn't be so alone.<eos> I'm not alone.<eos> Mothers don't count.<eos> I'd like to find somebody, maybe after Mother.<eos> You will.
I've been planning this in my head for so long.<eos> It has to be perfect.<eos> It will be.<eos> Are you sure you can do this?<eos> Of course.<eos> I mean it.<eos> I want this to happen tonight.<eos> Not in a day. Not in a week.<eos> I don't want you to get scared.<eos> I won't.
We procreate because that's the desire of the Goddess.<eos> To assure ourselves of worthy offspring.<eos> The strongest, the finest, the most sturdy of our kind.<eos> I see.<eos> Female, right?<eos> And what if someone just happens to have a boy?<eos> What do you do then?<eos> That depends.<eos> Let me ask you one other thing, because, frankly, I just don't get you. I do not get this place.<eos> Oh, you will.
"Those terrible things that happened...<eos> it was the SS, I knew nothing."<eos> People are thinking of themselves.<eos> Why shouldn't you?<eos> The world must know the truth.<eos> That's the only way out for us.<eos> We must answer for what we did.<eos> Every one of us.<eos> I promised I would help you.<eos> And I will.
- Look at me!<eos> I saw it... the thing Josh was talking about, it came for me.<eos> - Right after I found this.<eos> - What?<eos> The virus Josh was working on.<eos> I found it taped inside of his computer case.<eos> Off-line, where they couldn't get to it.<eos> - Will it work?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But Zeigler will.
Uncle Frank wouldn't be involved with something like this.<eos> - He was an animal rights activist.<eos> - keep telling yourself that.<eos> They probably told him what he told me - that the dogs got rabies, it spread, and that's why they had to put them all down.<eos> Well, they missed a few.<eos> - Clear?<eos> You guys get in the room.<eos> Stay there.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - I will.
Uh, Flynn, are you there?<eos> Come in, Flynn.<eos> Okay, this is too much.<eos> Is there something I can help you with? Did you retrieve the map legend?<eos> Yes. And the map also.<eos> The location of King Solomon's Mines is safe?<eos> All right. Grab the first plane out and return to the library.<eos> I'm not coming home right away, Judson.<eos> I'm going to the Mines. It's dangerous, Flynn. I mean, if the Key of Solomon should fall into the wrong hands...<eos> It won't, okay?
No!<eos> Do not worry, my child.<eos> My child.<eos> In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.<eos> Amen.<eos> Sit down, please.<eos> Are you Inés Bilbatua, begat by one Tomás Pio Bilbatua and his wife María Isabel?<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> - We have only a few questions and we expect you to answer truthfully.<eos> I will.
Pretty soon.<eos> But we just started a site.<eos> I can get somebody else to handle it.<eos> Lucy.<eos> I want you to come with me.<eos> Look, it's a bigger company, the money would be better, and I could really use you.<eos> - Owen...<eos> - You don't have to decide right now.<eos> Just think about it.<eos> Okay, I will.
- What are you sorry about, sweetie?<eos> Taking him out of school or trying to turn him into some kind of spy?<eos> Alex isn't a spy. He's a 14 year old kid, lady!<eos> Well, that's what makes him useful to us.<eos> And what happens if he gets hurt?<eos> What if he's killed?<eos> Could you live with that, Mrs Jones?<eos> I worked for Ian Rider nine years. I didn't know about any of this.<eos> - if anything happens to Alex ...<eos> - It won't.
Jacob, stay here.<eos> You'll get to know Anna better.<eos> You could take out Helene for dinner.<eos> I'm going to to Sweden with the twins.<eos> We're going fishing.<eos> You're a strange man, Jørgen.<eos> She has to eat.<eos> She's a terrible cook.<eos> - Take care of yourselves, okay?<eos> - We will, mother.
- That is why those girls are so skinny.<eos> - Oh. No, no, no.<eos> Give me that.<eos> There's, like, eight dollars of Jarlsberg in there.<eos> You know what?<eos> I just have to stick it out for a year.<eos> One year.<eos> And then I can do what I came to New York to do.<eos> But I can't let Miranda get to me.<eos> I won't.
It's not going to be an issue, because in about five minutes, you're going to be making a loud splat sound in the Atlantic, so I don't need any instructions from you about the far future, thank you very much.<eos> Uh, yeah, I'm a little scared.<eos> I'm not that crazy about, um, well, heights... and, uh, open water.<eos> Do you think they ever found that guy?<eos> Well, anyway, we came this far, might as well give it a try.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, you ready? Yeah.<eos> Did you find your customer?<eos> Not yet... but we will.
Which is odd, because you've done nothing but describe him for the last three hours.<eos> I know.<eos> But there's just something about him.<eos> Maybe it's the fact he doesn't spend all day in a leotard and a dancebelt.<eos> -Maybe it's his tattoos. He has three.<eos> -There she is.<eos> -That you've seen.<eos> -Yes, that I've seen.<eos> I can't believe you haven't told him who you are.<eos> I will.
Really?<eos> Why didn't you tell me when we passed You Province?<eos> I should have paid a visit to Yin Sun<eos> His Majesty commanded that there must be no delay<eos> Who is that?<eos> That is you<eos> The Prince<eos> The hostage ln which case<eos> I shall not reach Khitan<eos> No, you will not
I had to pay the light bill for my mom's.<eos> You're trying my patience, Tech.<eos> Now, they gave you the mornings off so you can get that GED thing, so you can improve yourself.<eos> Because you need improvement.<eos> So you can improve and get here on time. Look, I'm sorry, man.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Oh, I know it won't happen again.<eos> Just so you know, in case it does, you're gonna find yourself on the outside looking in, bro.<eos> Improved or not.<eos> It won't, dawg. All right?
Trust me.<eos> I'm good at car accidents.<eos> Everyone'll miss you.<eos> They'll say great things about you.<eos> Only the Covenant will know the real truth.<eos> But, to them, you'll become a legend.<eos> The one who gave his life for them.<eos> How about you let her go, and I let you live out your life?<eos> How about I make you my "weyotch"?<eos> I'll never will you my power.
No.<eos> Did you ever wonder if this was all you'd ever do, all you'd ever be?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Everyone's waiting.<eos> Miss Delacroix, I don't think I want to be just a ballerina.<eos> - It's just nerves.<eos> - You're not listening.<eos> I can't give up everything for ballet.<eos> No one's asking you to give up everything.<eos> But you will.
What?<eos> So, can you... huh, get yourself up... and... huh, to class in the morning?<eos> I guess...<eos> Because there's some possibility, that I may be spending the night.<eos> Okay, I get it.<eos> Well, have a good night.<eos> And be careful... okay?<eos> 'Cause I worry about you, in that place all alone.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will...
And there's Esther coming up...<eos> - And he passes to Cohen...<eos> - Go on, Bernie!<eos> Anyone for bar mitzvah cake?<eos> And here's Lila coming out with the cake...<eos> But what I now think is this.<eos> What happens when you become a man is that you stop blaming your dad for not being perfect.<eos> You realise he's just a man and you love the man he is.<eos> And on my bar mitzvah, my dad became my friend for one day and I loved him.<eos> And I always will.
Five for one, one for five, bring Elizabeth to me alive.<eos> One for five, five for one, as my will, so be it done.<eos> Five for one, one for five, bring Elizabeth to me alive. One for--<eos> Your faith is strong, but your God is weak.<eos> My God is not weak, Legion.<eos> Then where is He?<eos> I think I shall enjoy this human form.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Someone takes things from you, you take it right back.<eos> One for five, five for one, as my will...
White rum, vodka, coconut cream, blue curaçao, fresh cream and pineapple juice.<eos> Fine.<eos> As long as there's no gin.<eos> Gin makes me drunk.<eos> Cheers!<eos> It's the last one.<eos> Good idea, I think they've run out.<eos> We'll meet again, won't we?<eos> Promise me we'll meet again.<eos> - Of course we will.
No, it's not, and you know it.<eos> You've seen him. With Bill in custody, you're the only one that can invoke it.<eos> - Look, I don't know, Audrey.<eos> Curtis, CTU is barely functional.<eos> You are the one that can turn it around.<eos> Even if I agreed, section 1-12 requires documentation, testimony, groundwork.<eos> The record of what is going on right now is documentation enough.<eos> Curtis, please.<eos> Think about it.<eos> - I will.
My chair?<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> I had it adjusted.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Adjusted? What are we talking about?<eos> Suvarov is over six feet.<eos> He can't be looking down at the president of the US.<eos> That's a risky proposition.<eos> If the press finds out...<eos> - They won't.
It's the best thing in the world for him to have a man around here.<eos> - What he said about me and Alaska...<eos> - You don't owe me an explanation.<eos> I figure if you had wanted to tell me about your past you would have told me already.<eos> I trust my instincts.<eos> And I trust you.<eos> Former president David Palmer was killed just a short while ago.<eos> No information has been released, but an independent source has verified that Palmer was in Los Angeles visiting his brother...<eos> - Bill will call if he needs us, you know that.<eos> - No, he won't.
I know that.<eos> It wasn't you.<eos> It was me.<eos> I may have been out of my mind and not know where I was... Doing or anything, but it was me.<eos> You're in pain.<eos> I know you've been in pain for a really long time.<eos> Don't feel sorry for me.<eos> I care about you.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.
What's wrong with you?<eos> You know you have to be careful about who you have over.<eos> You just disregard that and who that affects?<eos> No.<eos> God! - Don't say that!<eos> - Stop yelling at me!<eos> I just think you're being disrespectful.<eos> Well, I just wanted to watch a fucking romantic comedy, Ben!<eos> Please don't tell your dad I said that.<eos> I won't.
OK. What did you argue about?<eos> abigail Zealy?<eos> - No, man.<eos> Just merchandising.<eos> - You argued about merchandising?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Warren thought he deserved 70% for the concept, but I think since I did the drawings, I...<eos> - Do you have a publisher?<eos> - No.<eos> And now we never will.
Now I could only get general rifling characteristics- six lands and grooves with a right-hand twist, um, but...<eos> But not enough individual characteristics to run it through IBIS.<eos> Exactly. Sorry, man.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Hodges.<eos> Your victim did not have GSR on his hands.<eos> Okay, what about metallic trace from the garage floor?<eos> Thank you, Hodges, for performing that incredibly elaborate test requiring copious concentration and an advanced degree.<eos> So you don't have any results from the metallic trace on the garage floor?<eos> But I will.
My office hours begin at 1 p. m. on Tuesdays.<eos> - Show up.<eos> - You're gonna tutor me?<eos> Think of it as dance lessons.<eos> After three weeks, I guarantee that you'll pass with flying colors.<eos> In fact, I will bet you 10 bucks.<eos> That's is a very generous offer, I just<eos> - I just- I know that you can do this.<eos> I wish I had your confidence.<eos> You will.
You did good, Dennis.<eos> I've been waiting all this time for the two of you to make things right with each other.<eos> Will you tell my brother that everything's good with me now, that, um... I'm okay.<eos> Tell him that, uh... he's free to take his shot.<eos> Tell him that I'll always be looking out for him, me and the old man. Come with me now.<eos> Everybody's waiting for you.<eos> Who?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Will you tell Andrea that I had a crush on her too?<eos> I will.
Oh God!<eos> Oh God!<eos> Let me in!<eos> Let me in Bill!<eos> No!<eos> It's raining!<eos> Please, let me in!<eos> No, you're never coming in!<eos> Stop telling people I slept with you!<eos> I will!
Oh God!<eos> Let me in!<eos> Let me in Bill!<eos> No!<eos> It's raining!<eos> Please, let me in!<eos> No, you're never coming in!<eos> Stop telling people I slept with you!<eos> I will!<eos> I will!
Tell me you were never in love with me.<eos> Let me hear you say it.<eos> I never wanna see you again.<eos> Yes!<eos> I'll send you copies on Monday.<eos> Life is a strange fast trip.<eos> I'm just glad we all have seats.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Don't forget to scream.<eos> I won't.
Hello, Miguel!<eos> And you must be the fiancee.<eos> Aren't you supposed to be upstairs?<eos> Some people would do anything to get out of jury duty.<eos> Step down, please.<eos> Come on.<eos> This is number 6.<eos> She didn't say much, but she was a very important part of the team.<eos> - Stay cool.<eos> - I will.
Actually, me date's here.<eos> It'll have to be another time.<eos> We look out for each other, me and Jack.<eos> We have to. We're the only family we've got.<eos> You can have a couple of ours, if you want.<eos> Liam's cute.<eos> Bites a bit, but he'll grow out of it eventually.<eos> Jack says you're clever.<eos> The last thing you need's to get trapped round here.<eos> - l won't.
-Do you have any metal detectors?<eos> -Some of them don't work well.<eos> -Any other witnesses?<eos> -There's 1 500 students in the school.<eos> -I would think so.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> Good questions.<eos> Nice work.<eos> Officer, would you like to see Zellie?<eos> The detectives will.
Yes, yes.<eos> The problem with an explosive delivery system is that, because the drug is now an aerosol, a third of the tests ignited the medication, rendering it useless.<eos> They call it flashing.<eos> Long ago, we experimented with gas weapons.<eos> We found them most difficult to use in outer-atmosphere combat.<eos> When fired into an enemy vessel, the weapon caused explosive decompression in the targeted compartment.<eos> We had thought of that, yes, but if you want to affect a large population simultaneously, an aerosol gas is really the only way to go.<eos> Now we have to figure out a way to get it into your enemies' hive ship.<eos> Yes.<eos> We will.
No one's gonna do anything you don't wanna do. I'm talking five minutes, here.<eos> Sam!<eos> Five minutes.<eos> Go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Look, I can't begin to understand what you went through.<eos> - That's right, you can't.<eos> - But, Max.<eos> - This has to stop.<eos> - lt will.
I'll bet if we check the copy machine log, it will tell us that copies were made with mrs. Hauser's code, say, 4:03, 4:04 P.M.<eos> Should I call them over?<eos> You're bluffing.<eos> The copy machine can't do that.<eos> Well, here's your choice.<eos> You can call my bluff, and we'll all find out exactly what the copy machine can do.<eos> Of course, if you choose that option, I'm posting this Tritons photo on your home page.<eos> I've heard what happens to Tritons who reveal their secrets.<eos> I don't have a home page.<eos> You will.
Vinick lobbied for federal approval for San Andreo 25 years ago.<eos> He's the reason the plant's there.<eos> - When is this gonna break?<eos> - The press is kind of preoccupied.<eos> We don't want to nudge them?<eos> We could put it out, yeah.<eos> He could hit us back for playing politics with a mushroom cloud.<eos> If the press finds it on its own, it'll be 900 times bigger.<eos> - And what if they don't find it?<eos> - They will.
Praying for the people of San Andreo.<eos> Matt, I'm taking Arnie Vinick to California.<eos> I know this could help him politically.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - The senior senator from California.<eos> If I do anything else, I'd be playing games with a national emergency.<eos> Well, you have to do what you think's best.<eos> - Keep me in your prayers too.<eos> - Yes, Mr. President.<eos> I will.
Our students have launched a very effective divestiture campaign.<eos> Which we admire.<eos> We believe you have the domestic constituency to support bold action.<eos> Yes, that's true.<eos> We may be willing to support reopening your arms sales to China.<eos> - In exchange for what?<eos> - A resolution sanctioning oil revenues to Khartoum.<eos> - The Chinese will veto it.<eos> - They might.<eos> - Yeah, they will.
I'll just get another lawyer.<eos> Okay, go.<eos> Find somebody else.<eos> But let me give you one last piece of advice.<eos> Save your money.<eos> Pocket your $800 an hour and work your deposition with your driver... or your pool boy or the woman who presses your shirts or someone who won't say "boo,"<eos> because you have zero interest in hearing how this should be done, but your problem isn't your lawyer.<eos> It's you.<eos> She is never gonna give me my deposit back.<eos> Yes, she will.
You never saw what was right in front of you.<eos> She's right.<eos> He sees things, he knows things that he didn't know when he was alive.<eos> And now there's nothing I can do.<eos> - It's too late.<eos> - No, it's not too late.<eos> He knows that he mistreated you both.<eos> He didn't know how much you loved him.<eos> I still love you.<eos> Edward, I always will.
Yeah, but what you want then is a four-wheel drive car.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> Think about it.<eos> The lake doesn't freeze like that, does it?<eos> It freezes level.<eos> It's nothing to do with hills. You need four-wheel drive... Four-wheel drive will give you control in slippery corners.<eos> That's what it's for. That's why rally cars are four-wheel drive. You need four-wheel drive.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - You will.
- That's all.<eos> - What's that?<eos> Yeah, if you haven't figured it out by now, you probably won't.<eos> Doesn't matter, just as long as everything's back to what it should be.<eos> It will be if you get us back.<eos> I mean, otherwise...<eos> How are we gonna get them back?<eos> Oh, I can take care of that.<eos> Yeah, but how will you know when to take them back to?<eos> Well, the ring will.
If Marlon and Hannah committed this crime together, then they're probably still working as a team.<eos> It's all part of the plan:<eos> he confesses, then she confesses.<eos> Muddy the waters enough, they both get off on reasonable doubt.<eos> Well, if we can't get one to implicate the other, we're screwed.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> What's wrong with you people?<eos> You want me to confess?<eos> Again?<eos> Fine, I will.
- Yeah, I think so.<eos> We'd be better if you stopped talking when I'm trying to show them how to save his life.<eos> - Listen, Vic...<eos> - I'm all over this.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Go find Neela, please.<eos> Okay, Abby, look.<eos> Look for the wire in the oropharynx.<eos> I can't see it.<eos> - You will, you will.
Leukemia has a higher prevalence in both the young and old.<eos> Cameron: So does asthma.<eos> House: No, no, no.<eos> They can both get diabetes.<eos> N o.<eos> The nearly dead and the newly bred have more in common with each other than with people in the middle.<eos> It's weird.<eos> Some kind of circle of life thing.<eos> This kid doesn't have kidney failure.<eos> He will.
Unless they were in high humidity.<eos> When Nikki's body was found, the hot water had steamed up the room.<eos> By the time we got there, the moisture had evaporated.<eos> We didn't miss something. We just couldn't see it.<eos> So what exactly are we looking for?<eos> Anything the moisture isn't sticking to.<eos> Footprints, handprints.<eos> When you see something, just circle it with the chalk.<eos> So if someone walked in here while it was humid, their footprints would appear under new moisture.<eos> The outlines will.
Never.<eos> He loved me.<eos> For three weeks a year.<eos> No.<eos> He loved me all the time.<eos> I was the one who could only manage three weeks a year.<eos> I'm afraid that I...<eos> I'm just afraid that I don't have a generous heart.<eos> I'm afraid that I won't have the chance that I had with Kirk ever again.<eos> You will.
Jonathan.<eos> You know you're the only man I've ever loved.<eos> It's been so hard without you.<eos> Your voice, your touch.<eos> I miss you so much.<eos> I miss you too, sweetheart.<eos> Why did you have to leave me?<eos> I'm sorry, Martha.<eos> I didn't have any choice.<eos> And soon, neither will a lot of other innocent people.
everything is going to be ok.<eos> I have to meet a friend, someone who will help us.<eos> we've got to get out of here now.<eos> you promised you would protect my children.<eos> that's exactly what I'm doing.<eos> just get in the car, please.<eos> we have to move!<eos> you promised you would keep us safe.<eos> and I will.
let's find her.<eos> agent Gideon.<eos> It's good to see you again.<eos> you're not a very good liar.<eos> I wasn't lying.<eos> your evaluation took me out of the field.<eos> I simply wrote the truth.<eos> there's gonna come a time. when you can't follow orders.<eos> it hasn't happened yet.<eos> it will.
My heart may be on your battery packs, but it's still my heart.<eos> It's my decision.<eos> It's my damn life.<eos> That's right.<eos> It is your life.<eos> And it is your life that is at stake.<eos> And it is your life that will end if you continue to push like you did today.<eos> You said the LVAD would make me better.<eos> I told you the LVAD would buy you more time.<eos> And it will.
- ETA is 20 minutes.<eos> - Why is he on a plane?<eos> He had to commandeer the plane in order to secure the evidence against Logan.<eos> I'll brief you en route.<eos> I cannot emphasise strongly enough the explosive nature of the evidence.<eos> I need you to put him into protective custody and bring him back here to CTU.<eos> - Understood.<eos> - Logan will send his men to retrieve it.<eos> - You've got to get to Jack first.<eos> - We will.
Whenever you're ready...<eos> The Pebble.<eos> It's on!<eos> Your winner, and still the champion, The Blind Bandit!<eos> No!<eos> How did she do that?<eos> She waited, and listened.<eos> To make things a little more interesting, I'm offering up this sack of gold pieces to anyone who can defeat The Blind Bandit!<eos> No one dares to face her?<eos> I will!
I finally told the truth about not getting into Brown and things are great.<eos> Life is so much better when you're honest.<eos> You just mean what you say, you say what you mean.<eos> I feel like you.<eos> Now that you're on a roll, you gonna tell Sandy and Kirsten too?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I'm gonna wait a little bit on that.<eos> It'll go down easier with an acceptance letter to RISD in my hand.<eos> - What if they find out?<eos> - They won't.
The only way out of here would be to first disable the force field around the bars, which is only accessible from the<eos> outside.<eos> - I brought you food.<eos> - Oh, thank God. I'm starving.<eos> No, no, no, I can't think on an empty stomach.<eos> Why are we being held here?<eos> Oberoth wishes to speak to you further, and he feels he can no longer trust that you will remain in your quarters.<eos> Well, he's right.<eos> Yeah, if he wants to talk to us, why doesn't he?<eos> - He will.
- So I can date now?<eos> - Sailors during wartime? No.<eos> But you are growing up, so I guess I have to get used to that.<eos> - Mr Hall, you took down all your lights.<eos> - Yeah, I thought it would be better.<eos> - I bet it would have worked.<eos> - It might have.<eos> I bet they could have seen us from space.<eos> We'll never know.<eos> Then again, maybe you will.
What you mean is you thought you got me with that shot, right?<eos> Tried to kill my sister, too!<eos> Now open the trunk!<eos> I didn't shoot her.<eos> Open the trunk!<eos> If you didn't shoot her, then what's this? That isn't mine.<eos> You're going to tell me you don't remember showing me that on our first date?<eos> And you used it this afternoon?<eos> ! You have no proof of that.<eos> No, but I will.
Hi, Troy.<eos> Hello, Kyle.<eos> You do know what we're all about here, right? At Coming In?<eos> Well, yeah, but he doesn't need to be here.<eos> He's a success story.<eos> Kyle's renouncing his sexuality?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Are you sitting down?<eos> Now, who'd like to speak first?<eos> Okay, I will.
You're carrying too much baggage.<eos> Widow, you'll be in command.<eos> Demoted.<eos> I guess that makes him Private America, huh?<eos> This is for certain<eos> The Chitauri wouldn't assassinate a king just for kicks.<eos> They're up to something over there, and I want to know what it is.<eos> My Lord, there have been complications in securing the planet.<eos> Nothing must stand between us and the meteorite.<eos> Nothing will.
- Really?<eos> Because right now it sounds like a threat.<eos> - Tyler, you have to talk to us.<eos> - No.<eos> If we get out of the house, can you make it so their cars can't start?<eos> No, I'm not helping.<eos> Didn't you see what they did to that other girl?<eos> They took her away.<eos> I don't wanna go away.<eos> You will.
Or we could assume it's a symptom, in which case whatever's in his lungs is also in his brain, unless you've got something more promising.<eos> I'll go get an MRI of his head.<eos> Keep testing till you find something.<eos> I'm going to my office to rest for a while.<eos> It's been a long time since I took an anatomy class, but I'm pretty sure you're moving farther and farther away from my lungs.<eos> Running out of places to look, aren't you?<eos> It doesn't mean we're gonna stop looking. Oh, no.<eos> Not for six more hours.<eos> - Do you want us to fail? - No.<eos> But you will.
Where the hell is the promicin?<eos> Stop.<eos> We have to find Collier.<eos> That's what I'm going to do.<eos> I'm gonna draw him out, make him come to me.<eos> How do you propose to do that?<eos> I'm going to the Center.<eos> I'm gonna bring it down<eos> - and everyone in it if I have to.<eos> - No, you won't.
I should have pulled it together and not locked myself up in my bedroom.<eos> The important thing is is that you know this wasn't your fault.<eos> I just couldn't stand the loss, and I never meant for you to feel it, too.<eos> That's why I felt that you were better off without me.<eos> Both of you.<eos> I lost my family because of what I did, not because of what anybody else did.<eos> Tell daddy he didn't lose his family.<eos> Jake is your family.<eos> He needs you.<eos> He always will.
"Goodnight noises everywhere. "<eos> - Hi, nana.<eos> - Uh, wait.<eos> - Ok, I will.<eos> - She wants me to come with her.<eos> She's ready to go now.<eos> Tell mommy and daddy I'm gonna like it there.<eos> Nana says so.<eos> Tell them I love them.<eos> I will.
- You all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> We're heading west, toward the money, toward L.J.<eos> Just got one more stop to make.<eos> What for?<eos> You trust me?<eos> Of course, I trust you, Brad.<eos> It's just that if anybody finds out about this, I--<eos> They won't.
The professor showed.<eos> You mind showing me the notes?<eos> Forget it.<eos> You're hardly the first girl to be led astray by Dick.<eos> You up for something tonight?<eos> Maybe Noam Chomsky's reading the Havana phone book somewhere?<eos> I'm stuck at work tonight.<eos> Maybe you could drop by?<eos> G-rated booty call in the library.<eos> Maybe I just will.
After a while, it gets...<eos> You hear too much.<eos> It changes how you... see people.<eos> I'll have to show it to the others.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing. Just, I bet you don't.<eos> And you know this from finding my CV on the internet?<eos> No, because I know the pendant.<eos> Well, you're wrong. Because I will.<eos> Yeah. But you won't.
That wasn't my thought.<eos> What?<eos> I wasn't thinking anything, that wasn't my thought.<eos> It must have been yours.<eos> That one!<eos> There!<eos> That's yours.<eos> Yeah, that was mine. I, um, certainly seem to be enjoying myself.<eos> You would.<eos> You will.
SARAH's gone HAL on us. Get us out of here!<eos> She can't hear you.<eos> But I can.<eos> Sheriff Carter does not wish to be disturbed.<eos> He's feeling ill.<eos> I know, but he paged us.<eos> It must have been sent in error.<eos> let her in.<eos> I believe one of you may try to exploit the opportunity to leave.<eos> No, we won't. Right?
He figured God could give a computer a soul if he wanted to.<eos> Do you think that's true?<eos> I know it is.<eos> Hey. What are you doing here?<eos> I was just on my way to school.<eos> So...<eos> I spoke to the credit card company and pulled some strings with my old boss.<eos> You know you're gonna have to pay back every penny, right?<eos> I know.<eos> I will.
It's mine. Lucy and Ethel would die for that bag.<eos> May I?<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Careful with that clasp, Liberace.<eos> There must be a pin sticking out of it somewhere.<eos> I don't see it.<eos> There.<eos> Thank you so much. And please come back again soon.<eos> I will.
I hope you're happy!<eos> Mom, I like this guy, and I'm sorry if it makes you unhappy, but I'm going to keep seeing him.<eos> Doesn't the place look great?<eos> I came in and straightened up.<eos> I wanted everything to look nice for you.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's just that...<eos> I'm home, but it doesn't really feel like home.<eos> It will.
Many years he worked the orchards for the Ramirez family.<eos> And when the general took over, he was forced to work with them too.<eos> - [Spanish]<eos> - So as a gesture of kindness... they let his daughter get married there.<eos> Forgive Rohan his pride.<eos> You know, a gardener for a father-in-law.<eos> There's no shame in working with your hands.<eos> - Don't forget that, Rohan.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> I will not.
Anything else?<eos> Hey, you there, don't rest.<eos> Come, get up.<eos> Duro, come, walk.<eos> - Here we are.<eos> - Girlie, are you coming, too?<eos> I forgot, Abuzer, bro.<eos> Duro, I swear you look like a man now.<eos> Abuzer, bro, isn't Tekin coming?<eos> He will, shortly.
Okay.<eos> So we all have a little healing to do.<eos> I'm not looking for your sympathy.<eos> - So much as?<eos> - Dinner.<eos> Last time you and I had dinner, it turned out to be a terrible idea.<eos> Not for me.<eos> I am a senior partner here.<eos> You say that as if it will get you laid.<eos> It will.
Yes<eos> We just left his office<eos> What,did we turn him loose<eos> You let him escape<eos> Black male,33,six foot one,name is derek morgan<eos> You're standing there trying to convince me that a local hero is my killer while you let my suspect dance our the back door<eos> I'm gonna charge all of your asses<eos> Yes,as soon as possible<eos> You have to tell your officers that morgan's not a threat<eos> Like hell I will
Chuyia, that's enough.<eos> Chuyia, stop.<eos> Chuyia.<eos> Enough.<eos> Come here<eos> Chuyia says you're getting married.<eos> Yes.<eos> Have you gone mad?<eos> Nobody marries a widow.<eos> He will.
Yeah, on an epic scale.<eos> But, you're alive. That's what matters.<eos> - That looks pretty nasty.<eos> - Oh, I'm not in pain.<eos> That thing possessed an ungodly strength.<eos> It flicked me aside like a bug!<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> My feelings mostly.<eos> But it could have killed you, Ged.<eos> And so it will.
Now, question:<eos> California Penal code 148A, obstruction of justice is that one year state prison?<eos> - County. - County.<eos> - Bring in kidnapping, then you go state.<eos> Oh, you are so good at that legal trivia, aren't you?<eos> Oh, is that it?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Now, you two have a nice weekend.<eos> Here, let's see.<eos> Will they?
Pretty sure.<eos> You could see it coming.<eos> Anybody could see it coming.<eos> Don't be so serious.<eos> Here.<eos> What?<eos> -We're gonna play a game.<eos> -What kind of a game?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Well, actually, you won't.
And Harry, of course.<eos> Soon to be the youngest Triwizard champion there's ever been!<eos> Hooray!<eos> Hogwarts, Hogwarts Hoggy Warty Hogwarts<eos> Teach us something, please<eos> Mr. Crouch?<eos> A man has died here, Fudge.<eos> And he won't be the last.<eos> You must take action.<eos> I will not.
- No. - No.<eos> No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.<eos> What's life without a few dragons?<eos> Everything's going to change now, isn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Promise you'll write this summer.<eos> Both of you.<eos> I won't.<eos> You know I won't.<eos> - Harry will, won't you?
Then there was a car accident when Victoria was 7 years old.<eos> Her mother was killed and I lost my eyesight.<eos> Victoria was left with me.<eos> Funny how families get made, isn't it?<eos> You got family?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Well you must have.<eos> Everybody's got family somewhere.<eos> I don't remember then.<eos> Well, maybe you will one day.
You wouldn't have one of those enchanted crosses here in a cabinet maybe we could take with us?<eos> Look, John, no offense, I just don't think that it's a great idea, you know you going on a solo mission to save the world.<eos> That's my vote.<eos> I don't know what pops thinks, but that's...<eos> Take him, John.<eos> Kill him after.<eos> If you get back, see me about membership.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
He'll only talk to Riegert alone.<eos> Which brings us right back to the question du jour.<eos> Who the fuck is John Riegert?<eos> Don't tell me, first one to blink loses... and we all go home.<eos> I know where she is.<eos> It's just a matter of time now.<eos> - Have you won her over?<eos> - I haven't had the chance.<eos> Yet.<eos> But I will.
You used it on him.<eos> That's how you reset him.<eos> No one would ever use ECT on a child.<eos> I don't know that he is having seizures.<eos> If he is, that could send him into status.<eos> It's a permanent state of seizure.<eos> No, no.<eos> Babak is my friend's son.<eos> I would never risk that.<eos> You will.
- I couldn't find any mob bosses.<eos> Well, sergeant?<eos> - It's "lieutenant" now.<eos> You really started something.<eos> Bent cops running scared.<eos> Hope on the streets.<eos> - But?<eos> - The Narrows is lost.<eos> And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.<eos> We will.
The hostages are clear.<eos> Your chopper is ready.<eos> Sir.<eos> - I just want to go home.<eos> - Stay calm.<eos> Please, don't move.<eos> - Then this stuff happens.<eos> - Sir, I need to concentrate.<eos> - Please, get this thing off!<eos> - I will.
We have to find a way off-campus.<eos> Where's Rich?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think he keeps a set of car keys there.<eos> Look in his desk.<eos> Good.<eos> I'll meet you in your room.<eos> No, I'm on my way to you.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I will.
Only then can you have control. See that?<eos> The bouncers are like your dials, you know. You control the mood with them.<eos> You can turn it this way or turn it that way.<eos> With a good team of bouncers, a fellow, you could conduct the place like an orchestra.<eos> Do you know, Mr. Jackson... the establishment I would most like to visit just now?<eos> No. Which is that?<eos> This bar of yours.<eos> This bar of your dreams.<eos> Well, who knows?<eos> Maybe one day you will.
I'll get you some juice.<eos> Can you help?<eos> I said I'd coach the girl's team.<eos> Well, we really could use you at the factory now, too.<eos> Your mom's having a real hard time with this.<eos> And she's already short handed.<eos> Oh, jeez.<eos> I don't know.<eos> What's to know?<eos> You either will or you won't.
All right.<eos> Will you wait here for me?<eos> You'll sit right here and wait?<eos> I'll just be five minutes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why don't you say something?<eos> I will not talk about this.<eos> We'll talk about this right now!<eos> I won't!
-Honestly.<eos> -That's not--<eos> You can casually scratch while really picking a little.<eos> -Thanks for the allowance.<eos> -Good rule.<eos> When sending the pants, we'll write a letter detailing the most exciting thing that happened while wearing them.<eos> That's good.<eos> So most exciting thing that happens to you.<eos> And what if nothing exciting happens?<eos> -It will.
Sonic Boom?<eos> Try "Gym Teacher Man." No, Dad!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm calling the school. The tuition we pay them!<eos> Dad, don't.<eos> Dad! It's not Coach Boomer!<eos> It's me, OK? I don't have any powers.<eos> But you never said... I mean, you made it seem like...<eos> Like I had super-strength like you? But I don't.<eos> But you will, Will!
What do you like?<eos> We have a great section of... do-it-yourself.<eos> Do you like to "do it yourself"?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> How is the mood striking you now?<eos> What's your name?<eos> I'm Beth.<eos> Andy.<eos> Don't tell on me, okay, Andy?<eos> I won't.
Really, that's...<eos> That sounds nice.<eos> Okay.<eos> My goodness.<eos> I think we better get back to work. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I better go back to work.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, okay. All right.<eos> So, you mull it over and I'll talk to you soon.<eos> All right, I will.
- Why?<eos> - There are balconies.<eos> When he gets into bed... I give the signal by switching off the light.<eos> And if the bomb's too powerful and you're in the next room?<eos> Well, that won't happen.<eos> Right?<eos> Robert?<eos> - Robert?<eos> - Robert?<eos> It won't. No.
Course.<eos> This is mine.<eos> You got it from the staff kitchen.<eos> No, I made that.<eos> This stuff is really good for your skin.<eos> It has like all these minerals in it.<eos> - Let me see!<eos> - Let me just finish!<eos> - It doesn't match at all.<eos> - It will.
I'm so sick of this acting thing, it's just not working out.<eos> It's a hard field.<eos> You have to keep plugging at it.<eos> - I'm sick of plugging. Tom's mother was right.<eos> Itjust gets to a point, you know?<eos> Or should I say your mother-in-law? Hey, look.<eos> Let's not go into one of those, OK?<eos> I don't know what I'm doing with you.<eos> You're never gonna leave Ohloe.<eos> Maybe I will.
I don't like the idea of you making love with her.<eos> I don't like the idea of you going off island-hopping with her.<eos> It's romantic!<eos> Hey, keep your voice down.<eos> You know I make love to her.<eos> And you know it's just routine.<eos> For God's sakes, can't you wait a few weeks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just wanna know that something's gonna happen, you know?<eos> It will.

I'll give him a day, maybe and then I'm going to call.<eos> Make sure you overnight the Cheerwine.<eos> Cheer, like "Cheerleader". Today.<eos> I want him to have it immediately.<eos> It's his favorite soda pop.<eos> It's regional. You can only get it down here.<eos> George says you can only get it down here.<eos> So, do that?<eos> If this happens. Oh my God.<eos> It will.

You can only get it down here.<eos> George says you can only get it down here.<eos> So, do that?<eos> If this happens. Oh my God.<eos> It will.<eos> I think I'm in love.<eos> It will!
I'll cover your arse because it's my arse too.<eos> Your stupid games could've ruined both of us, Frank.<eos> I don't want to know the truth!<eos> We both know it was your fucking fault either way.<eos> Come on, you give me a hand.<eos> Without Brian Jones they're finished as a rock band.<eos> I mean, in the next 12 months.<eos> You mark my words.<eos> No, they'll do all right without Brian.<eos> We all will.
Who was she?<eos> Her driver's licence says Barbara Carey.<eos> Notice she got shot, just like the last guy.<eos> -Yeah, I noticed.<eos> -Thought I'd mention it.<eos> D'Angelo, I want pictures of all the cars in the parking lot... licence plates so we can read them.<eos> -All of them?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Who's going to pay for the film?<eos> I will.
It's national security!<eos> - A real ladies' man!<eos> - Well, they're in love.<eos> We have no show for Tuesday, fellows.<eos> So get out there and make some news.<eos> Rob a bank.<eos> Mug an old lady.<eos> Do something.<eos> - You look at the Secretary Stevens footage?<eos> - We will.
Thank you.<eos> That's good.<eos> One more?<eos> This is fun.<eos> Sounded a little gay, but it was good.<eos> No, no, no. no. That's it, dude. That's it.<eos> I get too many callbacks, Sylvia's going to get suspicious.<eos> Oh, Sylvia's going to be kissing your ass.<eos> Not if she recognizes your voice.<eos> Oh, she won't.
I'm homeward bound Got my head turned around<eos> Zippin' up my boots<eos> Goin' back to my roots<eos> Come on, Lauren.<eos> Stand by your man, Lauren.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Lola, this is a Charlie from Northampton.<eos> I'm looking at a shoe fair programme with a big gap where you should be.<eos> But I have to say, unlike most people, wherever you leave, you leave a gap, Lola.<eos> You will in Northampton.
- That one looks fat.<eos> It does, doesn't it?<eos> But they all help make the tree strong, strong enough to weather any storm.<eos> Like a family.<eos> - Like our family?<eos> - That's right.<eos> You need your family, Tarzan, and your family needs you.<eos> - Nobody needs me.<eos> - I do.<eos> And I always will.
The guy fucking laughed at me.<eos> - Where are the real ones?<eos> - Well, gee, Elena, I don't know.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Meet me at my house at 10.<eos> What now?<eos> - What do I do?<eos> - Just get her to admit she killed him.<eos> And if she won't?
Some violent force... destroyed the whaler.<eos> And... and then... and then it hit us.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Violent force, huh?<eos> And you were, what, about 50 miles out?<eos> It's also known as the Bermuda Triangle.<eos> L... I never said anything about the...<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Relax, relax. You don't have to.<eos> I will.
That is sick!<eos> No dude, you should enjoy your funeral, because if people have nice things to say about you you should be there to hear them.<eos> - Oh shit...<eos> - Hey you little pricks, where is my money?<eos> Step off Ace, we ain't giving' you shit!<eos> No, D chill man.<eos> Do you believe the balls on this little prick?<eos> Look at his face, he likes to get his ass kicked!<eos> You want to kick some ass, kick mine.<eos> We will!
That was you in New York, huh?<eos> What you talkin' about?<eos> Hey Emmett, that's a beauty! Ain't it.<eos> This is what I call the catch of the day.<eos> Come on!<eos> - Pop?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> How do I know this isn't a dream?<eos> You don't.<eos> And you never will.
If it were up to me, you would all win first place.<eos> He's just saying that so the losers don't feel bad.<eos> Hi, Nani.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> OK.<eos> Welcome to our annual May Day Festival, where one of our little girls will be chosen alaka'i.<eos> First up is Aleka, doing the dance of the pineapple.<eos> Ah, that should do it.<eos> What if it doesn't work?<eos> It will.
Why don't you come to my bar anymore?<eos> You seem to have time to play with them.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Over here.<eos> What a coincidence.<eos> A female customer wanders in drunk just as we're closing, and asks me for a drink while I'm cleaning up.<eos> It's no good.<eos> I've been to your bar too many times<eos> The police will know that just by asking around a bit.<eos> No they won't.
When the body was found it was unrecognisable. Only the wedding ring and papers made identification possible.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - That the body buried in Cosenza... ..maybe isn't Ernesto Errera's.<eos> Salvo, Vattiato's a bastard!<eos> He sent this to make us investigate and then laugh at us. Me, you and the whole station!<eos> Mimi, do me a favour...<eos> Fuck off!<eos> I still don't think Errera is your man.<eos> I won't say he is just to please you!<eos> - You won't?
- Well.<eos> Just what did you think you were doing, Missie?<eos> I was taking some McGuffey readers over to the McClains.<eos> Miriam asked me to teach her children how to read.<eos> How come you never told me about Miriam's visit?<eos> I'm worried about you riding alone.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> You won't be doing this again, Missie.<eos> - Oh,yes, I will.!<eos> - Oh, no, you won't.
What you believe is irrelevant.<eos> There is another option,Mr. President.<eos> Go on.<eos> Suppose something happens to Bauer?<eos> Suppose he has an accident?<eos> That's an obscene suggestion.<eos> It solves a lot of problems.<eos> PALMER: Mr. President!<eos> This administration does not condone murder.<eos> And it never will.
What do you want, Dean?<eos> Sydney Bristow has taken something of mine - an access card.<eos> - I want you to get it back.<eos> - Why? What is it for?<eos> That's none of your concern.<eos> 48 hours.<eos> Don't let me down.<eos> - Are you sure this is the right move?<eos> - The right move? - If they find out what you're up to...<eos> - They won't.
What did they find?<eos> Undetermined at this point.<eos> Jack, the plan was to let Sydney and Vaughn open doors that we couldn't go through and to pull them back if they got too far.<eos> I don't see much here in the way of containment.<eos> We have an option.<eos> I can go to Sydney, engender her trust, convince her to bring the case to A.P.O.<eos> Hmm.<eos> No, she's too intuitive.<eos> Considering your relationship, she'll see right through you, through us.<eos> No, she won't.
- When did she give you this?<eos> - A few weeks ago.<eos> Why would Sophia do something like that?<eos> It would help explain why several missions were compromised.<eos> I personally investigated Sophia Vargas when she first arrived.<eos> Prints, background -- everything came back clean.<eos> Well, somebody tapped into agent Santos' laptop.<eos> And because of it, five agents are dead and several Rambaldi artifacts are gone.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> I won't.
Sweetheart, you should go and rest For tonight's performance.<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> Trance.<eos> Gemini.<eos> Yes, we've met before.<eos> You go on ahead.<eos> I'll be there soon.<eos> I just want to get to know trance gemini a little better.<eos> So would i.<eos> You will.
I did not battle The villains of technology To sit by<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Perhaps you must remember the pain that technology brings.<eos> Have mercy on her!<eos> Have mercy.<eos> Have mercy.<eos> We've been looking for you.<eos> I've been around, following everything.<eos> Such destruction... and it will get worse.<eos> Yes, it will.
- You're fired!<eos> - You can't fire me. I'm your son.<eos> - I'm firing you!<eos> - I was firing Lupe!<eos> Well, that makes more sense.<eos> - Lindsay came upon Lupe, who'djust been fired. - I no clean for family anymore.<eos> Can't you at least come over and DustBuster or something?<eos> - I no does Buster anymore.<eos> - Fine.<eos> I'll DustBuster!
- Never lost a single case.<eos> - You've never lost?<eos> My record is 6,043 to 0.<eos> Ever hear the one about the fella who died, went to the pearly gates?<eos> St. Peter let him in. Sees a guy in a suit making a closing argument.<eos> Says, "Who's that?" St. Peter says... "Oh, that's God.<eos> Thinks he's Denny Crane."<eos> I'm your boy, Walter.<eos> Never lost.<eos> Never will.
That device has been discredited for years.<eos> Well, check their Web site.<eos> It's still used in 1400 state and local agencies.<eos> Well, not in Las Vegas.<eos> Or anywhere else in this state.<eos> Say, was an advocate or a parent present at the time of the confession ?<eos> He didn't ask for his mommy and daddy.<eos> Long as he says he understands his rights, we don't have to have anyone there with him.<eos> He tell you why he did it ?<eos> No, but he will.
I see him in the window with a gun. So I take off.<eos> I heard two shots.<eos> He killed him.<eos> That's it.<eos> It's his word against mine.<eos> Now, who are you gonna believe, a felon, or someone who catches them?<eos> I will believe the evidence.<eos> Well, good luck with that.<eos> 'Cause last I checked, you didn't have any.<eos> But I will, Mr. Merrick, I will.
What?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> This is getting to be way too easy.<eos> Hope!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Actually, not for long.<eos> Okay, you heard me say it, and I meant it.<eos> I do not want anything to do with that box!<eos> I swear!<eos> Oh, but you will.
I'll get a team out to his house.<eos> In the meantime, we'd like to see his office.<eos> Suspect's cell is goin' straight to voice mail.<eos> Karl's a good man.<eos> That's what everybody says until they find a body in the basement.<eos> It's locked.<eos> I'll get security.<eos> No. We don't have time for that.<eos> Someone will have to pay for that.<eos> Karl Arnold will.
Oh, I'm not.<eos> The man abandoned me before I was born.<eos> I don't have a desire to have a relationship with him.<eos> OK, then I'm really confused why we're here spying on him.<eos> I just want to see what he's like.<eos> And satisfy my curiosity and get it out of my system.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> Now, you tell Charlie that Addison Prudy says, "Drop in sometime."<eos> I miss that ugly mug of his around here.<eos> I will.
That is his handwriting, isn't it?<eos> You know what I think?<eos> Rex felt guilty for the way he'd treated you.<eos> The adultery, the public humiliations.<eos> That's why he forgave you.<eos> He understood why you did it.<eos> How could he have believed this?<eos> Look, my wife cheated on me too.<eos> I know how much it hurts.<eos> And so will a judge.
-She's going up to the CT.<eos> What are all those tubes?<eos> Why isn't she moving?<eos> The tube helps her breathe.<eos> It's just a precaution.<eos> Sometimes babies have to be sedated for CAT scans.<eos> It doesn't mean anything's wrong.<eos> -Have the police found anything?<eos> -lt's still early.<eos> They will.
- Mr. Beckwith?<eos> - Are you Doctor...?<eos> Kovac.<eos> Yeah, please, come with me.<eos> Where is he? Can I see him now?<eos> - I'd like to talk to you about his condition.<eos> - She's in with Robbie now.<eos> - Is he awake?<eos> I wanna see him.<eos> - You will, soon.
Your heart stopped beating.<eos> We're doing CPR.<eos> Keep going.<eos> The compressions are getting oxygen to his brain.<eos> We're gonna get you to the hospital, all right?<eos> -You had no business going in there.<eos> -l'm sorry.<eos> You put yourself in danger, you put my men in danger.<eos> -Can we talk about this later?<eos> -We will.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. So all that stuff about you getting fired?<eos> No, that really happened.<eos> You did this. Didn't you?<eos> I had some help.<eos> You're amazing. You know that? I love you so much.<eos> I know you do.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing. It's just party planning, surprisingly stressful.<eos> You do realize I haven't actually gotten into the school yet. But...<eos> You will.
- You do surprise me, Richard Gilmore.<eos> - I'm sorry to interrupt your breakfast.<eos> - Lorelai.<eos> I need to talk to you guys about something.<eos> - Is everything all right?<eos> - Well....<eos> Sit down, Lorelai.<eos> Davida, bring a coffee cup for my daughter.<eos> I'm gonna have to call the office if this is gonna take long.<eos> No, Dad, it won't.
I can have my tailor steam out those trousers for you.<eos> Richard, that's not what he's wearing to the ceremony.<eos> I'm sure he's going to change.<eos> All right, girls, let's go get settled.<eos> - Are you okay to hang here for a while?<eos> - Sure. I'm fine. You go.<eos> Emily!<eos> Your florist is here, and everything looks fabulous.<eos> - Really?<eos> - No, but it will.
They're just stairweIIs.<eos> They told me you were in a nightgown, but I thought I'd come see.<eos> Very nice, huh.<eos> Heard O'MaIIey laid you out cold.<eos> Nice eye.<eos> - Whoa, who sent that?<eos> - We all pitched in.<eos> The whole floor.<eos> well, please, tell the whole floor a big thank you.<eos> Yeah, I will.
- Mariel - oh, my god.<eos> How'd you do this ?<eos> I was, um...<eos> I was trying to unscrew a light bulb.<eos> So you're going to the meeting tonight ?<eos> - Hmm, I think so. - Yeah.<eos> Would you mind giving me a lift ?<eos> Well, you know, I just don't think I should drive.<eos> - We should have found it by now.<eos> - We will.
[GASPS] It's a stunner.<eos> Puts you in metabolic stasis for a few minutes.<eos> You wanted him to see what it would feel like to kill someone.<eos> Think it worked?<eos> It worked.<eos> ROULETTE: Who are you kidding?<eos> You won't be happy stuck on that ship.<eos> I give you a month, and you'll be back here crying for me to give you another chance.<eos> Mark my words, Wildcat, I know your kind, and you will fight again.<eos> Of course he will.
Okay.<eos> Okay. What do I gotta do to change your mind?<eos> Well, there is that one thing you used to do when we made love.<eos> Besides that.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, if you do change your mind-<eos> I won't.
Pull him.<eos> Pull him, Locke.<eos> Come here.<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> We're okay.<eos> - I'm just glad you're safe.<eos> - But Vincent, he ran off again.<eos> He found his way back to you once, Walt.<eos> He will again.
She is hunting you.<eos> Who?<eos> Who are you talking about?<eos> The witch!<eos> Did you see her in your dream?<eos> Forget it... I just need some quiet in this house, so I can study.<eos> Can you, please, pray a little more quietly?<eos> She is coming for you.<eos> Yeah... Well, I don't believe in much of this, okay?<eos> You will.
This is the real thing.<eos> Jonathan's very happy.<eos> She makes him happy. That's all that matters.<eos> Mitch made me happy, mother.<eos> Nat.<eos> Peg.<eos> This is never gonna...<eos> This is Jonathan's day.<eos> Can we not do this? Okay.<eos> I won't.
Jerry!<eos> Hey, finish that database yet, Probie?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> Then it shouave been on my desk yesterday, shouldn't it?<eos> I didn't realize a compilation of nudie bars was that urgent.<eos> Well, it is.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't have to explain myself to a junior agent.<eos> Okay, is this work related, because...<eos> But I will, just this once!
Where and when, Abs?<eos> Granby and Harbor.<eos> Southeast corner. 1400.<eos> One of you is gonna have to pose as Kirby.<eos> Yeah, that really doesn't work for him.<eos> Boss, for once I gotta agree with Tony here.<eos> I don't think I'm the Hawaiian shirt type.<eos> You're the closest we've got to an agent in looks to Smith and Kirby, McGee.<eos> Which won't matter if whoever he's meeting with knows their faces.<eos> No, it won't.
The guys in the mailroom call her Energizer Abby.<eos> She works best alone.<eos> She's a lot like you. Very hands-on.<eos> Give it a month, Jethro.<eos> If she's still unhappy, we'll talk about it.<eos> - You can give me a month, can't you?<eos> - It's not me you have to worry about.<eos> - Abby works alone for a reason. - Which is?<eos> Something you should ask her yourself.<eos> I will.
Let him go, baby.<eos> Just let him go.<eos> It's a quarter past.<eos> She said she'd be here at 4:00.<eos> It's called making us sweat.<eos> Look, we don't know why Miss Rivers is coming.<eos> It may have nothing to do with the face mask.<eos> And if it does, we'll just play dumb and tell her to talk to our lawyer.<eos> - We have a lawyer?<eos> - We will.
I don't want to see that happen again to someone I love.<eos> I don't know who you are or what you're doing here but I am not going.<eos> Mom, please, you got to do this.<eos> Aren't you glad you got to come back for all this fun?<eos> Actually... I am.<eos> I'll put the bag in the car.<eos> I'll see you soon, sis.<eos> I'm so sorry that I put you both through this.<eos> - Just get better.<eos> - I will.
- You can't be serious.<eos> - Oh, it's real.<eos> Check your pompoms at the door.<eos> Well, I don't know what to say.<eos> - But, if that's what everyone wants...<eos> - No. Brooke, Rachel's the best cheerleader we've got.<eos> If we want a shot at state, we need her.<eos> Look, I make the rules and I say Haley's in!<eos> And, besides, the routine won't even work with an extra person.<eos> - Sure it will.
At least you're a smart pervert.<eos> Oh, by the way, you're gonna endorse me for mayor.<eos> Hey, knock knock.<eos> - I'm making lunch.<eos> You hungry?<eos> - Not really.<eos> Come on.<eos> You've seen enough Afterschool Specials to know that you've got to eat.<eos> I know.<eos> I will, just not right now.
But I don't.<eos> I guess the key is... just finding someone who feels the same way you do.<eos> In 1955... students at Tree Hill High School created a time capsule... that was to be opened in 50 years.<eos> They were simply asked to talk about their lives.<eos> Isn't it interesting how things haven't changed much?<eos> Within the next week, each of you will go into our converted supply closet... push the green button in front of you, and videotape your thoughts.<eos> -Do we have to?<eos> -Yes, you have to.<eos> I won't see it.<eos> Nobody will.
Somebody hurts you, they get hurt.<eos> We're all basically bad.<eos> That's the truth, Christina.<eos> There is something pure in her.<eos> - If she really finds faith-<eos> - So we make sure that doesn't happen.<eos> Jesse!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - We have to fix this.<eos> I will.
All who seek forgiveness will be delivered.<eos> Yes.<eos> If your brother accepts the Lord, he'll be free of this cage forever.<eos> - It can't bind him.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'll be available through this whole thing, if you need me.<eos> Reverend...<eos> Reverend, would you give this to my brother?<eos> It'd mean a lot to him, knowing it came from me.<eos> I will.
- I ain't finished.<eos> No need.<eos> I ain't going down for murdering no hack.<eos> I mean, you understand that, don't you?<eos> You ain't mad, are you?<eos> No, Trokey.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> I need out.<eos> I gotta find him.<eos> You will.
Three more gone this morning.<eos> Outcasts and idiots.<eos> They all get restless.<eos> With the fighting done, they want to be home with money in their pockets, not sitting in this dismal cold and wet.<eos> None of the good men have run.<eos> Nor will they.
Your mother forgives you.<eos> You forgive me?<eos> Mother forgives me?<eos> What if I don't forgive?<eos> Whatever you think she may have done, consider the possibility she did it out of love for you.<eos> I'll never forgive her.<eos> Be that as it may, your forgiveness is irrelevant.<eos> You must come home.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I will not.
How many fingers am I holding up?<eos> Poor dumb country mouse.<eos> Can't even count.<eos> My sweet, sweet Homie!<eos> You sacrificed yourself for the manatees.<eos> Rubes... so many rubeS... pounding me with their jet skis... rubes.<eos> Please, no, rubes.<eos> I'm gonna take you home and fix you up, 'cause you're the real endangered species-- a devoted husband.<eos> Marge, I'm always amazed you chose me.<eos> And I always will.
Sorry, we're ghosts now.<eos> Our spirits live in those two trees.<eos> Or, maybe we're alive and we just feel like jerking' you around.<eos> Or maybe we're one of each.<eos> Look, I'm not taking the scholarship.<eos> You're the one who deserves to go to Yale.<eos> That's so noble.<eos> But what about Jenda?<eos> Hey, I'm waiting till I find a girl who likes me for me.<eos> And you will.
Ho, ho, ho, Lex.<eos> Any reason we couldn't have met at the mansion?<eos> I don't make house calls.<eos> You wanna utilize my skills, you come to me.<eos> That is, if you really wanna bring down Jonathan Kent.<eos> Then I'm assuming you have some kind of grenade to launch at him.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But I will.
I see.<eos> Competition at work's not to your liking.<eos> It's fine.<eos> It's just not as good as it thinks it is.<eos> True, why don't we just reschedule.<eos> I can meet you any morning next week.<eos> - No, we can't.<eos> - We can't?<eos> I don't mean to be pushy, but this entrance exam is next week, and we really need to talk.<eos> - And we will, just not right now.
So, to paraphrase, you're telling me... the Neptune sheriff's department is a locked-down, squared-away citadel of security?<eos> That's a little flowery. But you can pretty much catch my drift.<eos> I run a tight ship, Keith.<eos> And you look good doing it.<eos> That's why they elected me, Keith.<eos> I'm gonna need unrestricted access to your staff at all times.<eos> Absolutely. We're here to please.<eos> Well, in that case, I'll need personal info for everyone who works here... personnel files, tax returns, security access levels, email addresses, browser histories... all that.<eos> No problem, buddy. Just say how high.<eos> Oh, I will.
Woman, you are light.<eos> You are lighter than Michael Jackson, you so light.<eos> - Where is my money?<eos> - Shane broke his arm last night.<eos> Sorry to hear that.<eos> - Where is my money?<eos> - I'll get it, I swear.<eos> I need more inventory.<eos> I'll pay everything back.<eos> Sure, you will.
It's the way to get a minimum wage vote.<eos> But sticking an amendment on the debt ceiling?<eos> They won't even try it if the president says no.<eos> - When do they need an answer?<eos> - You know, like, now.<eos> It's way too risky.<eos> But if the Democrats can force a vote on the amendment it puts the Republicans in a tough spot.<eos> Don't wanna vote against a minimum-wage increase...<eos> - ...in an election year.<eos> - But they will.
Fish that talk, animals that hunt using electricity,<eos> but their ultimate goal, to discover species completely new to science.<eos> In the second team, Kate Humble head deep into the jungle<eos> Her mission : to track down two of the Amazon's most elusive animals.<eos> The rare giant otter, and a strange pink river dolphin, the Boto.<eos> On their quest for new species,<eos> Mike and Mario have to cross one of the world's great natural spectacles<eos> The meeting of the waters.<eos> Here the black waters of the Rio Negro joins the milky waters of the river Amazon.<eos> Now, how long will the very, very definite line of demarkation
What's that?<eos> Engineer!<eos> Vladan!<eos> - The Captain's waiting for you.<eos> I've seen enough madness in this war.<eos> Be reasonable.<eos> I am, but I won't let her go.<eos> Your wife's back and Milos will be, too.<eos> Let the girl go.<eos> I won't.
It means a lot to me.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't find Lisa.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> - I'll see you around, huh?<eos> - All right, man.<eos> Alex, it's me.<eos> Please go away.<eos> C'mon, baby. Open the door.<eos> I don't want your friend to see me like this.<eos> He won't.
Just undiscovered science from an American named Thomas Edison<eos> It turns on with a whistle<eos> Please don't do that<eos> I see your eye is drawn to what I hope will be my crowning achievement<eos> A giant moth?<eos> It's a flying machine<eos> It can fly?<eos> Yes<eos> No.<eos> But it will.
Baby, I didn't know you were coming.<eos> I'm so sorry, I should have called.<eos> Baby, what are you talking about?<eos> - Guys, could you give us a minute? - All right.<eos> So what's up?<eos> I don't paint anymore.<eos> I used to paint all the time. I really loved it.<eos> - I didn't know that.<eos> So paint.<eos> I will.
He wants your ass to rub off on him is more like it.<eos> - Oh, my God. - Yeah.<eos> Whatever.<eos> - You can't go out with him tonight.<eos> - What do you mean I can't?<eos> I mean that I need you to stay for the late shift.<eos> Janine's sick.<eos> Yeah, she's got a cough.<eos> - She does not.<eos> - No, not yet, but she will.
You broke into Nappy Cutz?<eos> - No.<eos> - Damage anything?<eos> Kind of nice in there?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, man, they got a basketball court!<eos> He's beautiful, isn't he?<eos> I just want him to have everything I never had.<eos> I know you do.<eos> And he will.
Yeah, you're right.<eos> I'm gonna get on out of here.<eos> I need to go check on Loretta.<eos> She's talking about moving back to Georgia.<eos> I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling.<eos> I had a member of my family killed.<eos> But he was killed by a white man.<eos> What we need in the United States...<eos> You be safe out there.<eos> Yeah, I will, man.
It's ok to miss it.<eos> They certainly spiced up our old team, didn't they ?<eos> That wouldn't have gone over too well at Roseland, would it ? No.<eos> She's not a little girl anymore.<eos> What are you reading ?<eos> José Marti'.<eos> It was my father's.<eos> We got rid of all his books just to be safe but I kept this one.<eos> - If we don't win the finals...<eos> - We will.
Dig your way out.<eos> I'm sorry, Howard.<eos> I truly am.<eos> Reel 10, Mr Hughes.<eos> Mortgage Toolco.<eos> Every asset.<eos> You heard me.<eos> If you do that, you could lose everything.<eos> Well, I won't.<eos> I won't.
I'll tell Mikael it's his.<eos> - You can't do that.<eos> Why not?<eos> - You'll be lying to him and the child all your life.<eos> It's a small price to pay for a man and a child.<eos> You don't know what it's like to live a lie.<eos> And you do?<eos> I must do this.<eos> What if you get caught?<eos> - I won't.
You're gonna get hurt.<eos> What an idiot.<eos> Why does it always have to be your fight?<eos> - You might need this.<eos> - No. - I put my guns down a long time ago.<eos> - Come on. You're just being stubborn.<eos> You and me both, boy.<eos> Chris, listen.<eos> You be careful.<eos> I will.
And I deserve to have some fun.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I am gonna go to that dance.<eos> - Okay, great.<eos> And I am gonna meet my true love and I'm gonna dance all night.<eos> - I can't go.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't have a costume.<eos> - But you will.
I don't wanna worry you, but have you heard from Jonathan?<eos> Of course.<eos> He's here.<eos> Do you wanna talk to him?<eos> He's there?<eos> Great, put him on.<eos> Bobby, I'm sorry, it looks like he's gone to bed already.<eos> - But I'll tell him you called, okay?<eos> - Tell him Clare and I are fine.<eos> Okay, sweetheart, I will.
I need to... just go someplace else.<eos> I've had nightmares every night since the robbery.<eos> And I just want to put this all behind me.<eos> I just want to start a new life.<eos> Something like that.<eos> That's good.<eos> She's good.<eos> - She's great.<eos> - All right. Well, listen, I won't see you guys for a while, so... try to stay out of trouble. And Jack, will you keep an eye on him for me?<eos> - I will.
She doesn't have a name.<eos> She's just a doll.<eos> Isabel, your daddy...<eos> My daddy is the best daddy in the world.<eos> He had a really big meeting one day... but instead, he took me horseback riding. He would read me stories before bed every night.<eos> Sometimes he would make it up as he went along... and I knew, but I didn't care.<eos> Your mom said I was here to talk about your dad. But we don't have to do that if you don't want.<eos> I don't want.<eos> OK.<eos> Then we won't.
We're going on a treasure hunt.<eos> And I know that sounds dumb, but it's something that we have to do for Billy.<eos> That doesn't sound dumb at all.<eos> I completely understand.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Just call me when you get a chance.<eos> But I might be out of the house for a bit.<eos> Yeah, because my girlfriends and I, we're gonna go on a search for the lost city of Atlantis.<eos> Maybe my treasure will help buy your submarine.<eos> - Maybe. Maybe it will.
All right.<eos> If you need anything...<eos> Well if you need anything, you're shit out of luck.<eos> Now, this is where the exploratory team found the orchid.<eos> In the Selatan Basin.<eos> - It took them three days to get upriver. - Yeah.<eos> That was before the rainy season.<eos> These waterways could be dangerous now.<eos> - You said you'd get us there safely.<eos> - And I will.
This is crazy.<eos> You think this is crazy?<eos> Your dancing, that was crazy.<eos> This way, Agent Lloyd.<eos> Welcome to paradise.<eos> Okay. - The watermarks and holograms match.<eos> - Oh. But I still have to register the gun.<eos> You have a nice smile.<eos> I haven't smiled at you.<eos> You will.
Of all the cabbies in L.A., I get Max, Sigmund Freud meets Dr. Ruth.<eos> Answer the question.<eos> Look in the mirror.<eos> Paper towels, clean cab, limo company someday.<eos> - How much you got saved?<eos> - That ain't none of your business.<eos> Someday? "Someday my dream will come"?<eos> One night you'll wake up, and you'll discover it never happened.<eos> It's all turned around on you.<eos> It never will.
You shot two rolls of film which is very good.<eos> But the pictures all came out blank which was not very good.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because you went out at night, right?<eos> You should know by now... you can't shoot at night without a flash.<eos> I had absolutely forgotten.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> They're carrying a dead man to the graveyard... when you pass away, i'll carry you just like that.<eos> Yeah, right. You'll die way before me!<eos> No, I won't!
Okay, okay.<eos> He needed a bit of slapping around and I've had to pick him up from prison.<eos> And it won't be the last time.<eos> - But that's how it goes.<eos> I just wanna say, that you, Ø, have a promising future in the family.<eos> And for my part, you're like a son to me.<eos> With everything that comes with it.<eos> And, Gry...<eos> take good care of him.<eos> I will.
Dress warm.<eos> They're using the Call to lure the victim to them.<eos> We've traced it to the orange subway line, but that's as far as we got.<eos> You'll have to track them on foot from there.<eos> You have to get on the same frequency as the victim.<eos> Hear what he hears.<eos> Feel the Call, like he does.<eos> Can you feel it yet?<eos> - No.<eos> -You will.
For you understand, I want a fair fight this time.<eos> Jack wants to be the undisputed champion.<eos> This is the fight that I've been waiting for,for a long time.<eos> No, I can not arrange those kind of fight's.<eos> Look, even if you refuse, I can make it happen.<eos> You know Jack Miller, right?<eos> Jack Miller?<eos> He wants to fight you.<eos> No, I won't<eos> Yes, you will.
Yeah, I wish I could stay, but I really have to get back to work.<eos> You're going?<eos> So soon?<eos> It was nice meeting you all.<eos> I hope things work out for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mom, can you please not do that anymore?<eos> I just want my boy to find love.<eos> Is that so terrible?<eos> I will.
What's this spell, my friend?<eos> - Magic...<eos> - Give me that, Cópi!<eos> Go away!<eos> I'll never have a bath again.<eos> But why won't you wash your face at least?<eos> So that nobody forgets.<eos> It's just that you stink a bit...<eos> I won't have a bath.<eos> I won't.
- I've been getting calls from chat shows in Buenos Aires, in Lima, Rio, yeah.<eos> They want me to go over, all expenses paid.<eos> - But you can't start going on chat shows.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Has nothing I've said made any sense to you?<eos> They'll ask you questions which you won't be able to answer.<eos> - I can answer anything.<eos> - Yes, but the lies have to be consistent.<eos> - They can't keep changing.<eos> - They won't.
He's pulling his vote.<eos> - How many senators have we lost?<eos> - Three, all protégés of Milliken's.<eos> Unless Milliken calls off his dogs, we're not gonna get Health Care passed.<eos> He's sabotaging a bill that could benefit millions.<eos> He's showing you that he had the power to help start your political career, but he also has the power to end it.<eos> You can't lose this debate and fail to pass the most important legislation of your presidency.<eos> - We'd hand Keeler the election.<eos> - We haven't lost the senate vote.<eos> We will.
- I don't understand.<eos> They've got us on satellite.<eos> They'll pick us up if we try to leave.<eos> So we sit around and wait till they surround us?<eos> Exactly. The more bodies they send, the easier it'll be for us to disappear.<eos> No, I'm not waiting around to get caught.<eos> - Osterlind!<eos> - I'm leaving, Stephen.<eos> - Yeah? - Has she left yet?<eos> No. She will.
- I never said that.<eos> You said it.<eos> - Tomorrow, I'm going to call him.<eos> You'd call Homeland Security on me?<eos> The way you're acting, can you blame me?<eos> What I'm doing here, I'm doing for us, Grace.<eos> This is where we live.<eos> I just want us to be happy and not be afraid any more and it starts with Bradley Park!<eos> - I don't want it to end there.<eos> - It won't.
I want to hear that voice.<eos> Yeah, well, it's gonna take time.<eos> Stop it, Chris.<eos> About time.<eos> My dad out there?<eos> You are not going anywhere, my friend, because you are the subject of a murder investigation.<eos> I told you, Ray's the one who shot at that guy.<eos> Are you sure about that, Chris?<eos> Yeah, Michael and Dominic'll tell you the same thing.<eos> No doubt they will.
And I saw it go down with my own eyes.<eos> I've been investigating Morris for a few weeks now trying to figure out why so many of his suspects over the last five years just vanish or mysteriously wind up dead.<eos> Now I know.<eos> He takes the law into his own hands.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Well?<eos> - If she was lying, I couldn't sense it.<eos> Then how do you explain what happened?<eos> - Sure hope this works.<eos> - It will.
By creating an imbalance of power on one side, I know.<eos> But it's a far greater risk to allow Wyatt to grow up...<eos> To threaten both worlds.<eos> I agree.<eos> I like the way you think.<eos> Gideon?<eos> - No echo.<eos> - A good sign.<eos> They can never know we were behind this.<eos> They won't.
Mom's is down in the kitchen.<eos> - Great.<eos> I hope you find your amulet.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'll be at the office.<eos> But please don't need me, because I really think I'm onto something here.<eos> Stubborn little witch.<eos> She's not playing along.<eos> What if she finds us out?<eos> - She won't.
Did you tell Lar about my new thing? No, I actually didn't.<eos> Why don't you tell Larry about your new thing?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm designing these shirts now - that are selling like hotcakes. - Are you kidding?<eos> - Interesting, whimsical.<eos> I'm telling...<eos> - Good for her. I got them in the trunk.<eos> Wanna see them?<eos> - Not right now, but I'll see them.<eos> - You will, you will.
I'd offer you a drink, but I don't have any booze.<eos> Settle on a location for your new place yet?<eos> I'm looking.<eos> Good.<eos> - That's a lie.<eos> - Long as it's the only one you told me.<eos> I don't want Cy to back me, and I don't know how to do anything without him.<eos> I'll back you.<eos> You don't have that kind of money.<eos> - I will.
I don't want Cy to back me, and I don't know how to do anything without him.<eos> I'll back you.<eos> You don't have that kind of money.<eos> - I will.<eos> - You gonna turn prospector, Eddie?<eos> I'm gonna rob Cy.<eos> Don't, Eddie.<eos> He'll know.<eos> What's the time, kid?<eos> No, he won't.
400?<eos> The IP addresses and codes are in here.<eos> You need to log on at exactly 7:00 p.m.<eos> You miss the time, they'll pull the plug.<eos> You have exactly three minutes, start to finish.<eos> I haven't spoken to him in 13 years.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I suppose it's better than nothing.<eos> Nessa, both your lives, and mine, are in danger if anybody finds out.<eos> They won't.
You totally went behind my back.<eos> Daddy, Sam's having a little problem with the funeral home directors.<eos> Ed, Delinda is having a big problem... and it might stem from the fact that she once did it in a coffin.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Sam's just trying to be funny.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> It'll be bad for business if these morticians have their party in Mystique.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Yes, it will.
Arlene and Joseph will bring you to Melbourne.<eos> They'll pay your living and medical expenses.<eos> We found you an apartment.<eos> It's a really nice two-bedroom place, and we think you're gonna be really comfortable in it.<eos> As discussed, once the baby's born and handed over to the Stewarts, you'll have no right to see the child again.<eos> You'll have no right to correspond with the child, it will be entirely up to Arlene and Joseph to decide whether to tell the child anything about you.<eos> Understood?<eos> - Upon your discharge from the hospital, you will be given an additional payment of $20,000.<eos> I just want to make sure that you're gonna take really good care of the baby.<eos> Of course we will.
Hello.<eos> This is Adrian Monk.<eos> Sorry I missed you.<eos> Please leave a message when you hear the beep.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> - Oh, I said, "when you hear the beep."<eos> - Well, so what?<eos> I should have said, "after you hear the beep."<eos> They might start talking during the beep.<eos> No they won't.
I'll take that as a no.<eos> I think we're done here.<eos> Here's the phone number you requested, Agent Todd.<eos> Should I try your husband at home or work this time of day, Mrs. Powers?<eos> I don't know what happened to Atlas, okay, but my husband had nothing to do with it.<eos> So he knew you were having an affair?<eos> No...<eos> Derek was on assignment in Italy, he just got back last night.<eos> You can check with the Post, they'll vouch for him.<eos> Oh, I will.
Where?<eos> Chained to a sewer pipe. He's dead.<eos> Looks like we're running out of suspects.<eos> Yeah, sure looks like well.<eos> Want me to pick him up? Negative.<eos> Just keep him under surveillance.<eos> Whoa, hold on a second.<eos> You are not gonna believe where he's pulling in right now.<eos> Hammerton's Country Bar.<eos> Okay, maybe you will.
They can only prove that you defrauded an insurance company.<eos> No, mama.<eos> They can prove everything.<eos> They know you killed them with digitalis.<eos> They know you cut up Tommy into little pieces, and they know you threw him away in the garbage... she's just hysterical.<eos> You can't use any of this in court.<eos> She was read her rights.<eos> She waived them.<eos> We can use it all.<eos> We will.
Better, sir, thank you. Wanted me to check with you, see if you needed any extra help down here.<eos> Tell him I appreciate it, but we got things covered.<eos> Latest batch of requests for you.<eos> Most immediate priority's on top.<eos> This must be that daughter you're always talking about.<eos> She is a beauty,sir.<eos> She is that, Gunny.<eos> She is that. You change your mind,sir, you just call.<eos> Go plenty of people willing to help you.<eos> I will, Gunny.
It's been a long time since I've held a baby like this.<eos> Brings back all those nights with Matt and Annie.<eos> That silent communication.<eos> So uncomplicated.<eos> So intimate.<eos> Sometimes feels more intimate than anything else.<eos> Maybe you could help me with him.<eos> Just until this thing with Gina is resolved, until I get custody.<eos> - What if you don't?<eos> - I will.
- What...?<eos> What...?<eos> - I saw you at the motel.<eos> What are you thinking, man?<eos> Marissa's mom?<eos> I know what that must have looked like or seemed like, but it's not like that.<eos> - We've got a connection.<eos> - Yeah, not anymore, you don't.<eos> - Lf Marissa finds out...<eos> - She won't.
Besides, its not going to be my dad.<eos> Of course its not.<eos> Let's go ahead and get this over with.<eos> We have a 4 hour drive ahead of us.<eos> A 4 hour drive into a storm?<eos> Well the storms passing through.<eos> By the time we get there it should be gone.<eos> Okay, wait a second.<eos> Shouldn't somebody stay here by the phone? I mean, incase your dad calls.<eos> I will.
- Not as good as the new ones.<eos> Now I told you I was going to help you with your shop.<eos> This is part of the agreement.<eos> You got to start thinking like a business man, bro.<eos> I think you do enough of that for the both of us. Bro.<eos> If Whitey wants you to feel like you're part of the team, fine, I just...<eos> I don't understand why I have to baby-sit you.<eos> He just wants to make sure you're going to be able to get open.<eos> - I don't have a problem with getting open.<eos> - Well you will with me out of the line up. Okay?
The ravens grab the rebound and push it up court.<eos> Tim Smith passes to Lucas Scott, over to Nathan Scott for the slam!<eos> I see the Ravens are finally working together.<eos> Go ravens!<eos> You know you can trust me.<eos> Brooke, it's really important to me that Nikki never finds out where Jake took Jenny.<eos> I know it's important to you, Peyton.<eos> That's why you can trust me with this.<eos> But she still hasn't told you?<eos> No, but she will.
- Thank you.<eos> - Wait, wait.<eos> I'm sorry, we're fresh out of flesh.<eos> I want to thank you all for coming this evening supporting this good cause.<eos> Now all these young men belong to the highest bidders till that midnight kiss.<eos> Let's try to keep things legal this year.<eos> I'll give $5 for the microphone boy.<eos> - I'll go 10.<eos> - Do I hear 20?<eos> I will.
This guy, Rick, was doing coke?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Look, I know he's got a lot of music connections.<eos> And I know how important that is to you, but I won't have drugs in my club, Peyton.<eos> And I don't expect you to handle everything on your own.<eos> But you have to come to me if anything like that ever happens again.<eos> -I will.
And could you space out the meat so that it spells "happy birthday, moe"?<eos> ( Sobbing ) oh, god, I'm alone!<eos> ( Siren blaring ) apu, do you sell crazy straws?<eos> I've got a guy with a broken back, and I'm trying to cheer him up.<eos> Oh, mr. Homer, anything for a cuckolded boob.... I mean, uh, loyal customer.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Nothing, nothing. It just seems your wife has an active imagination.<eos> Why do you keep talking that way?<eos> You'll see when you read your wife's book.<eos> Well, then, maybe I will!
I will.<eos> So I'll see you in about an hour?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A lot you could do with this. Take a beautiful handkerchief and drape it over the top and you'd be in business.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Nate's gone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope this whole thing helps him move on.<eos> It probably will.
I know what a friend is.<eos> A friend is someone who would stand up for you and protect you.<eos> A friend is someone who would jump in a river to save you from drowning even if it meant they had to give up their own life for you.<eos> You don't need to tell me what it means to be a friend.<eos> Then you know that a friend would never keep me locked up in here.<eos> Get used to it.<eos> I did.<eos> People are going to come looking for me.<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
- So, how long can you stay?<eos> - Something I have to take care of.<eos> Show them what you have in your pocket.<eos> With a husband in dental school, he'll be able to fix your mouth, honey.<eos> Then for the capper.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> We know all about you, and I think it's great.<eos> Well, that's a relief, huh, Tony?<eos> Speaking of dental school, people told us Finn would never amount to much.<eos> He won't.
Teal'c, what are you doing?<eos> - We cannot bring her to Earth. - Teal'c.<eos> - We have the modulation program.<eos> - We haven't tested it.<eos> What if Fifth figures out what we were trying to do here?<eos> O'Neill would never allow a replicator access to SGC.<eos> Yes, he would, if he knew what was at stake.<eos> The Asgard satellite is armed.<eos> You said the humans wouldn't fire.<eos> They won't.
It's my hand that you need to put in the code.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> And the shield of the Atlantis Stargate will be lowered?<eos> Yes.<eos> What is this?<eos> Who are they?<eos> - Bring him to the gate.<eos> - They're friends.<eos> - Make sure he will enter the code.<eos> - He will.
Can I help you?<eos> - Yeah. - I'm looking for Carly Anders.<eos> - You just missed her. Oh, shoot.<eos> I was really hoping to catch up with her.<eos> - Is she a friend of yours?<eos> - We go way back.<eos> You wouldn't know where she was heading?<eos> Her mom's, I think.<eos> You could try her there.<eos> Thanks, I will.
-lt's not pity, Candace. lt's friendship.<eos> To be honest, I don't need that, either.<eos> Candace, we used to be best friends.<eos> I know things change.<eos> We're not friends now, but maybe that could change, too.<eos> I know I'd really like that.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Sorry, Tru.<eos> Some things change.<eos> Some things never will.
We made a promise.<eos> There was a man named Canute, one of the great Viking kings of the 11th century.<eos> Wanted his subjects to be aware of his limitations so he led them down to the sea and he commanded that the tide roll out.<eos> It didn't.<eos> Who gave us the notion presidents can move the economy like a play toy?<eos> That we can do more than talk it up or smooth over the rough spots?<eos> It's a lie.<eos> What we really owe that union is the truth.<eos> We're running around saying free trade creates high-paying jobs.<eos> And it will.
- Dress for success.<eos> I watched that motherfucker Cheese take re-ups... move weight all day, and not once did he go near a fucking telephone.<eos> Closest it comes is a call to a hanger-on's cell phone ten feet away.<eos> Which brings me back to what I was just discussing with the Lieutenant.<eos> So far, we've been up on some of these cell phones for nearly six months.<eos> The only drug talk we have is from street-level small fry.<eos> So, the feeling is that maybe two weeks from now... we don't go back to the court for another extension.<eos> We charge what we have... we try to roll someone up at Cheese or one of Joe's other lieutenants.<eos> What, are you kidding? We don't have a case worth making yet.<eos> And at this rate, we never will.
When did you first see it?<eos> I can't remember exactly.<eos> Sometime when I was a kid.<eos> Was it around the time you were abducted?<eos> Look maybe I'm crazy.<eos> All I know is that I'm dying here.<eos> I know what happened to me.<eos> I can remember all of it.<eos> But who's gonna believe me?<eos> I will.
So you untied him and you let him go.<eos> We untied him, but he didn't really move.<eos> We tried getting him up, but he just rolled over and wouldn't look at us.<eos> I was getting kind of worried, but it was getting dark, so we took off.<eos> Then I saw him this morning in class.<eos> He seemed okay.<eos> I'm sure he was perfect.<eos> Mrs. Case, I suggest you take your daughter home... and you have a nice, long conversation with her.<eos> Believe me.<eos> We will.
My friend is worse.<eos> -I'm sorry.<eos> -Yeah, thanks for asking.<eos> It's nice.<eos> You're nice.<eos> I can't believe you voted for Reagan.<eos> -I hope he gets better.<eos> -Reagan?<eos> -Your friend.<eos> -He won't.
Help must come to us.<eos> It must be getting near teatime.<eos> Leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime.<eos> We're not in decent places.<eos> Mr. Frodo?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's just a feeling.<eos> I don't think I'll be coming back.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> Of course you will.
Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.<eos> Who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain?<eos> And he did, Gandalf.<eos> He did.<eos> And who is this?<eos> Isildur's heir?<eos> It takes more to make a king than a broken Elvish blade.<eos> I guess that concludes negotiations.<eos> I do not believe it.<eos> I will not.
The day the human race was nearly destroyed... by weapons they'd built to protect themselves.<eos> I should have realized our destiny was never to stop Judgment Day.<eos> It was merely to survive it... together.<eos> The Terminator knew.<eos> He tried to tell us... but I didn't want to hear it.<eos> Maybe the future has been written.<eos> I don't know.<eos> All I know is what the Terminator taught me:<eos> Never stop fighting.<eos> And I never will.
Yes. My wife and I love New York, especially this time of year.<eos> She'd been here before, and I'd...<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> This is Andie.<eos> Hi.<eos> You guys enjoy New York.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We will.
I don't want to slip and break me neck.<eos> No, we wouldn't want that.<eos> This is the problem area here.<eos> It's loose as a Dublin whore.<eos> Oh, go on, knock it in.<eos> Yes!<eos> Now, just knock it in.<eos> Go on, knock.<eos> Come on, use some elbow grease.<eos> Aah! Okay, I will.
Oh, sure, that's grand.<eos> Congratulations, Aaron.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> How are Dan and Steve? They're fine.<eos> Say hello to them for me, will you? We will.<eos> Well, I'd best get back to the party.<eos> Mary will be wondering where I got to.<eos> Sure.<eos> You go on and look after that girl of yours.<eos> I will indeed.
How many times I got to tell you we don't moon the bitches.<eos> I thought you said we don't moon the handicapped?<eos> Them neither.<eos> -Guys?<eos> -What?<eos> -What's that?<eos> -What's what?<eos> I could have a one-night stand any time I wanted to.<eos> -Yeah, but you won't.<eos> -Maybe I will.
No harm must come to House Atreides.<eos> No matter what the cost.<eos> You handled that well.<eos> Shut up.<eos> As you wish, milady.<eos> We found their clothing near the bakery, Stilgar.<eos> We're certain they're no longer in the sietch.<eos> They must be wearing those robes they brought from Arakeen.<eos> But our search parties can't find a single trace of them in the desert.<eos> They won't.
- Fun?<eos> To victory.<eos> - Laughing at me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm walking straight.<eos> It's shameful and the field mice can see you.<eos> - I'm going no further.<eos> - I am.<eos> What if I run away?<eos> You won't today.
I'm from another place.<eos> Where would that be, Ricki?<eos> Somewhere else, Larry.<eos> Okay.<eos> I see.<eos> -And my name's not really Ricki.<eos> -And what would it be, then?<eos> Then how about I keep calling you Ricki just to piss you off?<eos> -If it'II make you happy.<eos> -Yeah, it will.
-Come here, darling.<eos> I feel like I know you already.<eos> -Very nice meeting you.<eos> -It's my pleasure.<eos> AII right, we're going.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go, Brian.<eos> Just remember, you two, keep an open mind because you never know.<eos> -We will.
- You're gonna dump her.<eos> You're breaking up with me?<eos> Can we still have sex?<eos> Naomi, listen.<eos> Listen to what I'm saying.<eos> Deacon, the only reason I went out with you is because I thought you were a nice guy.<eos> And now you wanna break up with me?<eos> Yeah, I guess so.<eos> - If you tell anybody about this...<eos> - I won't.
Yeah. Listen. I was thinking maybe sometime we could get some dinner or something?<eos> - If that's okay with you.<eos> - I'd like that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Of course, leave it to me to wait until you've got a boyfriend to finally ask you out.<eos> Timing was never your thing.<eos> No.<eos> Okay, so, thank you.<eos> And, call me about dinner.<eos> - I will.
The Yanks are great this season.<eos> Dave thinks they could beat Seattle's win record.<eos> Remember at Brown when we saw Ron Guidry win his 20th?<eos> Oh, man.<eos> He was on fire that year.<eos> We could've been too.<eos> Andrew, don't start or I can't hang out with you anymore.<eos> Sorry, it's just hard.<eos> I'll never meet anyone as good as you.<eos> You will.
Look, Yuan, Willie, whoever else is listening...<eos> You don't want me to be with Sarah, and I can't change that.<eos> I don't know where we're gonna be in ten, 20, 40 years.<eos> I don't know who we're gonna be.<eos> I don't know if I'm ever gonna be able to give her all of this.<eos> There are a million things that I don't know.<eos> But there's one thing that I do.<eos> And that's that I love Sarah.<eos> And I am going to love her day in and day out for the rest of my life.<eos> Now, will you please, please,
Ah, it's ok<eos> Did you have a good time last night?<eos> Yes And those french guys,<eos> Ok<eos> I don't need it.<eos> It's common for them to keep wariness We are about to begin the trainning.<eos> Too early.<eos> You have to start trainning now<eos> If you wanna join those matches<eos> Will you?
- I'm inside.<eos> You're on the street.<eos> - We're in this together.<eos> It's ourjob to protect them.<eos> There's only so much that I can do, okay?<eos> And it's not just them that I worry about.<eos> I can't protect you.<eos> - Where are we with Rohr?<eos> - He hasn't stepped up yet.<eos> He will.
I used to like to hear the music from the house as I was walking down the street.<eos> It was really pretty.<eos> It was?<eos> It was always the same record.<eos> It was the Mule Serenade.<eos> It was really pretty.<eos> Take care of yourself, Dad, okay?<eos> Yeah, you too.<eos> And remember to send me the girls' shoe sizes, okay?<eos> Yeah, I will.
Bottom line, with Ms. Kennedy gone, James faces some rough times ahead.<eos> -To keep him in a school setting--<eos> -Let me tell you something.<eos> This school is the reason he's doing as well as he is.<eos> But to keep him in a school setting--<eos> You take him out of this school, you may as well take his life.<eos> -l've compiled a list of care agencies.<eos> -Oh, I'll bet you have.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I will take care of it personally.<eos> Yes, I will.
But he's not aware of ordinary matters.<eos> Mr. Riversmith is an ambitious man.<eos> That hadn't occurred to me before.<eos> He is ambitious... and Francine is ambitious for him and for herself.<eos> There are other professors with microscopes... watching ants of different colors in other trees.<eos> He and Francine have to keep ahead.<eos> They have to get there first.<eos> Where could they possibly find the time to devote to a child... who has come so tiresomely out of the blue?<eos> -Do you think he'll take me to Siena?<eos> -Of course he will.
I was just about to, General.<eos> All right if I have a bite of cheese to go with this?<eos> Not much of an appetite earlier.<eos> Of course.<eos> -Did I hear the front door?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Riversmith.<eos> He's gone to bed.<eos> It'll seem strange without her.<eos> -It will.
It's all right.<eos> Harold told me you was coming.<eos> Why do the wrong ones keep dying, Pa?<eos> I shot a man today.<eos> Speak English, Dad, please.<eos> If you hadn't shot him, what then?<eos> - The riots would continue, sir.<eos> - And then?<eos> Maybe they would take power.<eos> Eventually they will.
And I'm starting to realize Mom and Dad's idea of appropriate behavior might be a little bit different than mine.<eos> Mish, you're in love.<eos> You're getting married.<eos> I mean, what's this like?<eos> I'm never going to be able to explain it.<eos> I wanted us to write our own vows for the wedding and now I can't do mine.<eos> How do you explain love?<eos> I guess I wouldn't know.<eos> I don't think I've ever felt that way about a guy.<eos> Someday you will.
- You think that's such a good idea?<eos> Sharon, just be cool, okay?<eos> Please.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> Hi.<eos> - You take care of him, honey.<eos> - l will.<eos> - You take care of yourself first.<eos> - l will.
He would have been rendered to dust under trampling feet... had you not kept a protective hand on his head<eos> "This life of mine is a gift from you, father"<eos> The life I lead today... is indebted to you in every breath<eos> "Arpita, even in a hundred births, I will not be able..." to repay their debt<eos> "Enough, son... enough"<eos> No father. I know nothing else<eos> You can't leave me and go away<eos> "l'm not leaving you, my son. It's only for a few days"<eos> "All right, father. I will not turn down anything you say" But you will have to listen to something I have to say<eos> "You will, won't you?
And you haven't put on your dress yet.<eos> We can't keep the master waiting.<eos> Waiting?<eos> For what?<eos> Why, your wedding, of course.<eos> My...<eos> I'm not Elizabeth!<eos> Of course you are, my dear.<eos> You may not see it yet.<eos> But in time you will.
I don't even have to know what it is.<eos> I mean, just talk it out with him, okay?<eos> Please?<eos> Irma, if you want, you can wait in the chapel.<eos> No, I'd like Irma to stay.<eos> Better still.<eos> Tell us what's on your mind, Roy.<eos> I've been... struggling with something for a long time.<eos> I prayed for years for it to go away.<eos> But it won't.
Hmm.<eos> Grandpa?<eos> Hmm.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Don't wait for me, Juni.<eos> I'll catch up with you.<eos> But we have to find... Carmen.<eos> Valentin, my old friend.<eos> You think you'll catch me this time, don't you?<eos> Well... you will.
Grandpa?<eos> Hmm.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Don't wait for me, Juni.<eos> I'll catch up with you.<eos> But we have to find... Carmen.<eos> Valentin, my old friend.<eos> You think you'll catch me this time, don't you?<eos> Well... you will.<eos> Oh, you will.
As I was telling her what happened, she didn't shout or cry, she ran away.<eos> - Maybe you know her.<eos> So good, so kind, so... gentlemanly!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Listen, you're going to think I'm crazy but I have to tell you, I don't think your brotherjumped, I think he was pushed...<eos> That's nonsense!<eos> Take her downstairs please.<eos> Will your brother come to identify the body?<eos> No, I will.
- No, Rocky, I'm not okay.<eos> I'm so far from okay, I can't even see it.<eos> Don't give up.<eos> We're close.<eos> Really close.<eos> Once someone in Penguin's organization is willing to talk...<eos> You can't keep doing this.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> - If Penguin finds out you're spying...<eos> - He won't.
In this house.<eos> With you"<eos> And this talisman belongs with you<eos> "The dreams we saw were the same, Raj"<eos> And we can fulfill them only by living together<eos> "Promise me, Priya.<eos> You will not leave me ever again"<eos> And you must promise never to shout at me again<eos> "When do I...?<eos> All right, I won't"
I still have the firefly<eos> It's in good health, like me<eos> Hi<eos> Sorry, I'm late<eos> Mmm...<eos> Hi, Ji-hae<eos> Sang-min, I won We made a bet<eos> I bet you'd come and Sang-min bet you wouldn't<eos> You have to treat dinner<eos> Okay, I will
Okay, Hank.<eos> - Where are we going now, Grandpa?<eos> - Back down the river to Belle Point.<eos> Ain't no oil wells at Belle Point.<eos> - Still stuck.<eos> - Still?<eos> Okay.<eos> Fire two.<eos> - Is that supposed to work?<eos> - It will this time.
[ chuckles ] How are things in that cute little barberShop ofyourS, B.? .<eos> You making ends meet? .<eos> Oh, you know.<eos> I'm definitely doing me.<eos> Getting this paper. ""Getting this paper."'<eos> Check this out.<eos> When you're tired of nickel-and-diming,just give me a holler.<eos> I'm gonna hookyou up.<eos> Well, you ever get tired ofwearin' those bum-aSS do-ragS, you give me a holler.<eos> I'll hookyou up.
Fine.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Just a little tired, like everyone else.<eos> No, I mean, about before.<eos> - It got tense between you and Carrie.<eos> - I can handle Carrie.<eos> You don't have the training or the experience to read a guy like Ali.<eos> - I shouldn't have put you in that position.<eos> - We should press him.<eos> - They will in Guantanamo.
What happens now?<eos> You are going to help me.<eos> Just put this right here.<eos> - Help you do what?<eos> - We got one last play.<eos> - To deliver Kingsley.<eos> - No.<eos> He's far too dangerous, and you'll never get close to him.<eos> You're right.<eos> I won't, but you will.
- I don't wanna argue about this.<eos> Just do it.<eos> Why's it taking so long to get this number?<eos> Barely anything here. There's something...<eos> - We need this, Randy.<eos> Come on. - I'm on it.<eos> They're sending Division to do an evaluation. - Yeah - Why are they doing this now?<eos> We're operational, getting results.<eos> Why don't they leave us alone?<eos> They will.
To the best of our knowledge, Sark's been bled dry of every piece of intel he knows.<eos> The burden of criminal justice notwithstanding, he now has a value only as a commodity in trade.<eos> Without knowing why they want Sark, how can we consider this?<eos> We think we know why they want him, so they can kill him.<eos> Intelligence provided by Arvin Sloane indicates Sark may be responsible for the death of a high-ranking member within The Covenant.<eos> They may want revenge.<eos> If your revenge theory is wrong, we're setting a terrorist free. To say nothing of the fact that taking Arvin Sloane's intel at face value is insane.<eos> I'm aware of your history with Sloane, but if Director Dixon can trust him, I think you can, too.<eos> For the record, I don't.<eos> I never will.
Thank you, Tom.<eos> Well, we have a new member today.<eos> Welcome.<eos> If you have anything to say, we'll be happy to hear it.<eos> Right now it helps just to listen, thanks.<eos> How long you been back?<eos> A little over a week.<eos> The dreams start yet, nightmares?<eos> No.<eos> They will.
You've said that before.<eos> It's different.<eos> What changed so much in one day?<eos> Everything.<eos> When Emily says she's going to the wine cellar, we move.<eos> The things you've done.<eos> There's just been too much suffering.<eos> You have every right not to believe me.<eos> But it doesn't matter.<eos> You will.
Rubbed blood into the wound.<eos> The hateful always have one or two wretched tricks to play.<eos> You must rest now.<eos> We have nothing to fear from them.<eos> They are alone.<eos> We are many.<eos> But Gunn and Wesley and Lorne.<eos> They've all been turned.<eos> - We have to stop whatever they're...<eos> - We will.
Mandarin's not tough when you've been around a zillion years.<eos> No, how is it that you always know exactly what each person needs to hear?<eos> Just look into their hearts.<eos> Or sometimes it's right on their face.<eos> - Senor.<eos> MAN: Si?<eos> Gracias.<eos> Muchas gracias.<eos> - I wish I could see what you see.<eos> - You will.
Excuse me.<eos> You're too young to be holding that ticket.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - I can't go to jail.<eos> - Let's just watch cartoons.<eos> - Sir, we will not be starting with Les Cousins... - until you leave.<eos> - Excuse me, but I thought my A.A.R.P. card... - was good for one and a guest.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I knew society would never accept this.<eos> And they never will.
We should've known that from Babylon.<eos> I take it we're moving on.<eos> Fireball shows, they leave us with no other choice.<eos> That's good. I'll get some sleep.<eos> Rest easy.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> Well played, little man.<eos> I wouldn't keep him waiting.<eos> I wonder if that poor baby is ever going to get to the Land of Nod.<eos> He will. He will.
Doctor.<eos> Medic.<eos> Care to join me for breakfast?<eos> Why the hell can't you just leave me alone?<eos> They're getting worse, aren't they?<eos> The dreams.<eos> I'm not talking to you.<eos> You will.
I just want you to be okay.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I just hope Jeffrey's okay, you know?<eos> - You know that song?<eos> - Tony Bennett, right?<eos> Jeffrey liked it.<eos> Some singer in Paris sang it to him once.<eos> It stayed with him for some reason.<eos> - I'd really like to meet the guy.<eos> - You will, man.
You used me to fill this house.<eos> You used me to fill your collection plate every week.<eos> You were doing God's work.<eos> Was it God that took away my childhood?<eos> Was it God that wouldn't let me play ball, or be with a girl, or go to the movies?<eos> I'm the only black man in West Indianapolis who can't dance, Daddy.<eos> (preaching) And I heard an angel say, with a loud voice,<eos> "Woe, woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth!"<eos> I never heard the angel, Daddy.<eos> You will.

There are a lot of interesting things here.<eos> But I strongly suggest that you stay inside.<eos> The winds can be treacherous.<eos> I'm sure there's enough to keep me occupied.<eos> If you'd like, you could spend some time looking at this.<eos> It's written in a dead language, over 1,000 years old.<eos> Everything about these people... their homeworld, their culture, has vanished into time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You don't have to feel alone.<eos> I won't.
Then you slept with him, then you found out he was a cop.<eos> Then he let you go.<eos> I have the exact same story.<eos> He let you go?<eos> He arrested me.<eos> - I don't think that means anything.<eos> - I think it does.<eos> Van's just a guy.<eos> We don't know if he loves you or me, or neither of us, or both of us.<eos> And we never will.
Now the info-Sphere will open its protective crust... So as to scan itself, completing its thousand-Year task.<eos> This is your one chance to enter the sphere. Scoot.<eos> Scoot now!<eos> I'm at the input console.<eos> I'm nervous, and I've got brain in my butt crack.<eos> Roger.<eos> Once you press the detonator, you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> This Brain knows about everything, right?<eos> It will soon.
- I am sure she is.<eos> Thank you both.<eos> Jason, how's your time?<eos> Would you like to join us for dinner?<eos> I'd love to, but I should get these papers up to my lawyer's office.<eos> - Next week?<eos> - Consider it an open invitation.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Richard, I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Yes, you will.
- Never mind, Tanna.<eos> Are you sure you don't want me to turn it off?<eos> - Try this one.<eos> - I love you.<eos> I love your cooking... but I swear if you make me eat one more bite of broccoli tart... I will beat you to death with it.<eos> Your mother is the pickiest woman I have ever catered for.<eos> She has impeccable taste, the highest standards... and she can smell an inferior tart a mile away.<eos> Depending on how long it's been left out, we all can.<eos> - She still hasn't called yet.<eos> - She will.

- Is this the off-white or the cream?<eos> The off-white.<eos> The cream is more creamy.<eos> I cut those myself, so they can be adjusted either way.<eos> I mean, they could be adjusted smaller.<eos> Taller would be tougher once they're cut... but if they tell a lie, they'll shoot right back up.<eos> - I assume you'll have servers.<eos> - Yes, we will.<eos> I assume you'll instruct your servers to omit the Pinocchio humor.<eos> - Yes, we will.
- Really?<eos> I'd love to have dinner with you.<eos> Great.<eos> Okay... well, I have your card.<eos> Why don't I give you a call this week and we'll make that happen.<eos> - Sounds good.<eos> - Yeah, sounds good.<eos> So, see ya.<eos> Watch those crosswalks.<eos> Thanks, I will.
- Carol Dandridge?<eos> Carol Dandruff from now on.<eos> Okay, now, don't take it out on poor Carol.<eos> It's not like she lobbied for it.<eos> I bet she did.<eos> That would be just like that old Porky Doody-dridge.<eos> You're really bummed about this, aren't you?<eos> On the outside, I am a mature adult... who's able to put setbacks like this in their proper place.<eos> On the inside, I just want to wear that pretty dress again.<eos> You will.
Out of fear, anger...<eos> I don't know, I was just so angry.<eos> He's a great kid, you know.<eos> And he loved us.<eos> He loved being a Ranger.<eos> I'm sorry, Billy.<eos> I'd trade my life for yours if I could.<eos> Maybe he traded his life for us.<eos> Yeah probably he did.<eos> I would.
In the presence of a queen.<eos> Heh, forgot it was Easter.<eos> Well, it is Sunday, 16th of April, seven days after the vernal equinox.<eos> I love Easter.<eos> Many do.<eos> Some for the rabbits, some for the resurrection.<eos> Most think of the food.<eos> All that fucking sugar?<eos> They don't think of the truth of the day.<eos> And why would they?
You know, I've been fucking on film for the last 30 years?<eos> And it's important that you think about your future.<eos> You think about what's going to happen afterwards.<eos> I've been really lucky with... you know, I started three Web sites as well as doing my paintings and everything, I have my auction site.<eos> So I've always got a lot of different eggs in the basket and things to fall back on.<eos> 'Cause it scares me.<eos> You know, I don't want to be 60 and have nothing to show what I've worked for.<eos> I did a half-a-dozen films in, like, 2005.<eos> I wouldn't recommend anybody get into the business today.<eos> I just wouldn't.
No, I made it up.<eos> For those real life situations where you wish you had a super power to get you out of?<eos> If you had a super power, what would you want to use it for?<eos> Well, technically, I'm not really in a situation I want to get out of.<eos> Well, what kind of situation are you in, then?<eos> I'm in a party situation.<eos> And if you could use a super power right now, what would you want it to do?<eos> I would make... everyone else disappear.<eos> And then what would we do?<eos> Well... we would...
It was the worst thing ever.<eos> And then it got worse.<eos> Clay... Helmet... your name does not belong on this list.<eos> But you need to be here if I'm going to tell my story.<eos> If I'm going to explain why I did what I did.<eos> Because you aren't every other guy.<eos> You're different.<eos> You're good and kind... and decent.<eos> And I didn't deserve to be with someone like you.<eos> I never would.
You know, I believed I could be brave, that I could be a survivor like Abraham was, and ridin' that RV into the sunset was... some of the greatest 37 minutes of my existence.<eos> But I know now that I was full-tilt delusional.<eos> I have never in my life been as scared as I was that night in the woods, kit to the grit, fully believing my number's about to be called, then seeing it happen to someone brave to a survivor.<eos> And then the pants-pissing terror of the rinse and repeat of that very same event ... I just...<eos> I couldn't.<eos> Being here means I'll never have to again.<eos> And neither will you if you just say "yes."<eos> Please say "yes."<eos> He would want you to.<eos> He wouldn't.
I'm committed to Madi.<eos> Yet the road they intend to travel is one I'm losing the ability to understand.<eos> I know what Billy's done... what should be unforgivable... and yet till so very recently, there's no one in the world I called a closer friend.<eos> The more he talks, the more I remember why.<eos> To turn on him now, to have him killed... which is what it would take to side with Flint... seems like something...<eos> I don't know I have it in me to do.<eos> You don't know, hmm?<eos> You don't know?<eos> Why should I follow you if you don't know?<eos> Why would anyone?
Alex Romero, inmate number A49452... cellblock five, cage 63.<eos> I'm serving five years on a trumped-up perjury beef.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did someone find out you're a cop?<eos> Yeah, apparently.<eos> Can't hide the truth forever.<eos> Inmates talk.<eos> Found out I was an ex-cop and jumped me.<eos> Uh, maybe I need to talk to my lawyer.<eos> I would.
Would you finish your coloring?<eos> Who are these people?<eos> Do you know?<eos> No.<eos> Mr. Rip. Look.<eos> It is all of us.<eos> There's you, teacher Na'omi.<eos> You think this looks like me?<eos> Of course it looks like you!<eos> Why wouldn't it?
Did you see anything before the explosion?<eos> I know you're in pain, but the detectives will be here soon.<eos> Good.<eos> I want to tell them who did it.<eos> Frank.<eos> No.<eos> Where is he, then?<eos> I want to ask him to his face.<eos> You know he would never hurt any of us.<eos> Of course he would.
After everything she went through, guess where she ended up?<eos> Phoenix.<eos> Got her teaching degree.<eos> Is married and has a kid on the way.<eos> She just couldn't get it together until she left Chicago.<eos> And as much as I love you, and...<eos> It would kill me to have you go...<eos> I don't know, Annie.<eos> I mean, if I could move somewhere, and start over right now...<eos> I would.
Oh, my beautiful daughter.<eos> What a joy it is, to celebrate your birth.<eos> Seems any day now, we will be losing you to another man. But we could do worse than you, Albert.<eos> Not much.<eos> Ow. Who knew inviting you into our home those years back, we would expand our merry band so exponentially?<eos> Dear Maja is as much a sister to our girls as she is to you.<eos> And now you've brought us Mr. Besso.<eos> Such a charming dinner companion.<eos> I hope you'll return for many more meals. Mm.<eos> Yes. And so would Anna, apparently.
James Read can chase us all that he wants.<eos> I only know this.<eos> Us.<eos> I only know love.<eos> The Indians said there was women.<eos> A ship full of 'em came to Jamestown.<eos> Did you not get yourself a wife from amongst them, Henry?<eos> Must you talk all day long?<eos> If I was a man in Jamestown, all them years, I'd want a maid.<eos> What man wouldn't?
Your family name means something.<eos> A pier's dedicated to you, charitable contributions...<eos> Almost 50 years of business at your inn.<eos> Do you really want these insinuations to go unanswered?<eos> You could dispel them.<eos> Well, what if Meg came back?<eos> Do you have information about where she is?<eos> No, I just...<eos> I just thought it might help.<eos> Of course it would.
I'll need to watch the trader.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would like that.<eos> Lord!<eos> I was just thinking about you.<eos> You were in my prayers, is what I mean.<eos> Thank you, Hild.<eos> Please continue, do not let me disturb your peace.<eos> Would you care to sit with me, in peace, Lord.<eos> I would, Hild.
What are you doing?<eos> - What are you making?<eos> - Um, yeah, my present for the wedding.<eos> Kind of an art piece.<eos> Oh, that's awesome.<eos> I don't know.<eos> So my brother is about to marry the sister of your boyfriend, so that kinda makes us something... - I guess.<eos> - Yeah, something.<eos> Well, I think that sounds like a good excuse to get lunch and just get to know each other.<eos> Ah, I would...
My fault? !<eos> You invited these zoo animals into my home, and you never told me you slept with this monkey.<eos> Approximately 20 times.<eos> What?<eos> Monkey?<eos> You-You didn't think that was something you should tell me?<eos> I-I... it's...<eos> You porked my wife? !<eos> I wouldn't use that word.<eos> I would.
The gun that killed Curt Framingham belongs to you.<eos> And your brother was in your house last night.<eos> He had access.<eos> Rafi doesn't even know the combination.<eos> It's 7-14-90.<eos> It's your birthday.<eos> You don't think he could figure that out?<eos> Look.<eos> You found out Bill or Curt or whatever he called himself was married, you got angry.<eos> - Any woman would.
Um, I also take care of Halley.<eos> And you live here for free.<eos> I do, ma'am, thank you, ma'am.<eos> This is so generous of you, I-I, um, I don't know what to say.<eos> Now you can come with us.<eos> Yeah, there's room in the bed by Sheldon's feet.<eos> As much as I appreciate this, I can't accept it. Okay?<eos> Halley's my goddaughter,<eos> I don't take care of her for money.<eos> I would.
"Oh, I love what you've done with the plating and the arrangement.<eos> It's amazing."<eos> You show those three dudes a bowl of baingan ka bharta, they would lose their mind.<eos> "Oh, fuck.<eos> Was it in pain before it died?"<eos> "Can we make people look at this as a punishment for petty crimes?"<eos> Like, Indian food is not visual food.<eos> It is audible food, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Like, if you walked past an Indian restaurant and there was beautiful pictures of food, you would not go into that restaurant, would you, ladies and gentlemen?<eos> You wouldn't.
Mr. Sims.<eos> Mr. O'Bryan.<eos> David Sims.<eos> Jimmy Harrell.<eos> Officer Installation Manager on Deepwater.<eos> Thank you very much for taking us out today.<eos> I know you guys are swamp. You didn't have to.<eos> I had to.<eos> Listen you mind losing that tie?<eos> I would.
- All right. - Whoo.<eos> - And her. Are they all appalled?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Move closer.<eos> You smell fantastic.<eos> You never would've let those breasts so near to me if I wasn't in a wheelchair.<eos> Oh, yeah? Well, you never would've been looking at these breasts if you hadn't been in a wheelchair.<eos> What? Of course, I would.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Well, I had to take you 'cause the first thing you'd be doing, you'd be scuttling around and yodelling the news that you were actually seeing a giant.<eos> And then, there would be a great rumple dumpus, wouldn't there?<eos> And all the human beans would be rummaging and whiffling for the giant what you saw, and getting wildly excited.<eos> And then they'd be locking me up in a cage to be looked at with all the squiggling, you know... Hippodumplings, and crocadowndillies, and jiggyraffes.<eos> And then, there would a gigantous look-see giant hunt for all of the boys.<eos> I won't tell.<eos> No one would listen to me anyway.<eos> I'm an untrustworthy child.<eos> Yes, you would.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Good girl. Good girl.<eos> If you want to play with all the new toys and be safe you pay the price of admission.<eos> But the people, they don't even know they've made that bargain.<eos> Where's the battlefield, soldier?<eos> Everywhere.<eos> -What's the first rule of battle?<eos> Never reveal your position.<eos> And if one unauthorized person knew?<eos> If Congress knew?<eos> So would the enemy.
You know, we like to think that it's, uh...<eos> It's helpful, you know, talk things through, find a... different perspective.<eos> You're telling me Naomi brings you across the wall?<eos> Not officially, no.<eos> Come on, sit down.<eos> Those shoes must be killing you.<eos> You're quite the gentleman.<eos> But, you know, Naomi told me you always have an agenda.<eos> Yes, well...<eos> She would.
She didn't want a lot of that.<eos> She didn't.<eos> Okay.<eos> How about you?<eos> Is that how you like it?<eos> How would you like it?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Having to sit up here in front of all these people, answering this type of question?<eos> That's what you meant.<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
No, I...<eos> Is that what Joe would say?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, yeah.<eos> Yeah, we've had "the discussion" and everything.<eos> So... Okay, good.<eos> Yeah, just let me know if we're making too much noise.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you think I should call my morn to tell her about Dad?<eos> No, I wouldn't, Patty.
Anne Carter.<eos> "Attaching file"...<eos> Okay, Nikki...<eos> Nikki...<eos> Please... please.<eos> She's 37 weeks pregnant.<eos> She's very fragile right now.<eos> She will not understand this, not in a million years.<eos> I'm sure she wouldn't.<eos> I wouldn't.
- It's in the blood.<eos> He looked just like an ordinary man, like an officer, but it was him!<eos> Now, what she should have done was keep him talking, but she got so frightened and she tried to run away, and he grabbed her!<eos> You don't need to worry about him here now.<eos> But you can tell your fortune..<eos> ...if you go out to the barn at night.<eos> - How? What do you do?<eos> You stand and you listen... and if you hear knocking, that's bad, but if you hear grain pouring, it's good.<eos> But I don't suppose any of you would go out there.<eos> I would.
Just make up an excuse and get out of jury duty, Jess.<eos> - Please, I need you.<eos> - No, Nick.<eos> It's a right and a privilege.<eos> In South Africa, they don't even have juries.<eos> They have a-a judge and two assessors.<eos> God, I would have bullied you as a kid.<eos> Jury duty is supposed to be a sacrifice.<eos> Would I like to be at work right now, participating in the Spirit Week assembly?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Whoever you were before doesn't matter here.<eos> There's no rules or restrictions.<eos> You can change the story of your life.<eos> You can become someone else.<eos> No one will judge you, no one in the real world will even know.<eos> The only thing holding you back is yourself.<eos> What did you mean by that?<eos> You said no one in the real world will know.<eos> I thought you weren't supposed to notice things like that.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
That was like one and then 1A.<eos> You know what?<eos> Um... Let's try some role playing.<eos> All right, Amy, I want you to pretend to be Mike, and Mike, I want you to pretend to be Amy.<eos> And now I just want you to just tell me about your day.<eos> Hi, I'm Amy.<eos> All I did today was, like, rub lotion on my face and talk, talk, talk, talk.<eos> Okay.<eos> Amy, would you like to...<eos> Yes, I would!
Lucy!<eos> But a little bunch of mates needs a bigger bunch of mates.<eos> And we grew up with some beauties.<eos> These girls, they used to pick on me in high school.<eos> But they grew up just fine.<eos> Now they just pick on their boyfriends.<eos> Part-time cowboys, full-time unemployed.<eos> Podge and his old mate Boof, they love their beer.<eos> And Michelle, she loves Podge.<eos> And who wouldn't?
Who put you up to this?<eos> Was it Vernon Masters?<eos> All you need to worry about is what's in that file.<eos> And you never thought to question the convenience?<eos> Vernon asked you to discredit me, and you locate the ideal report.<eos> Whatever this is, it's a forgery.<eos> I'm not falling for your slick talk.<eos> But you're falling for his.<eos> You're willing to believe any phlegm Vernon coughs up onto the paper because you're worried that I would betray your trust.<eos> I wouldn't.
- Would that it'were so simple.<eos> - Would that it'wuuuhs so simple.<eos> My dear boy, why do you say that?<eos> Why do you say, "twuuuuuh"?<eos> - Well, you said, say it like I say it.<eos> - Yes, but...<eos> Would that it twuuuuuuh, so simple.<eos> - Would that it'were so simple.<eos> - Would that it twuuuuuuh, so simple.<eos> Would that it...
Yeah?<eos> You should've left her or killed her.<eos> No, that's stupid.<eos> What's stupid is you being out there when you don't have to.<eos> You did the same thing.<eos> You didn't... you and Spencer didn't have to go out there, but you did.<eos> - That's different.<eos> - It's not.<eos> I wasn't gonna leave her out there like that.<eos> You wouldn't.
Upload complete.<eos> Operation complete.<eos> Six high ranking terrorist taken the fuck down.<eos> Zero American casualties.<eos> How do you safeguard the life of the soldier?<eos> Oh, there's some calculated risk.<eos> If the soldier doesn't SOAP back quick enough and the target dies we could conceivably lose an American soldier but our soldiers are so highly trained there'd be very few deaths.<eos> If they fail, of course we terminate the dormant consciousness in the soldier's body.<eos> We don't want these terrorist walking around in the highly capable body of American troops.<eos> No, we wouldn't.
My dear Touie.<eos> Hello? Hello?<eos> That Italian man who says he can send a message across the sea, how's he expect to do it without a wire?<eos> Marconi.<eos> Most people think he can't.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - I don't know, but I think it would be brilliant if he could.<eos> Were you able to talk to mother?<eos> - I'll keep trying.<eos> - You'd better.
Not to mention the 400,000 gallons of water dumped on top of us.<eos> Owen, video link is up.<eos> Copy.<eos> We need to pull your guys, let the bomb squad take over.<eos> My agent's trained in EOD.<eos> Trained and unprotected. One second.<eos> Hanna.<eos> Go ahead, Granger.<eos> Can we send a robot in there?<eos> I wouldn't.
Was that Ward?<eos> Unfortunately... I think that's something else.<eos> My God.<eos> What is she walking into?<eos> Would I change things if I could?<eos> You weren't asking about becoming Inhuman.<eos> I was talking about us.<eos> Every terrible thing that has happened to you could have been avoided if you'd never met me.<eos> I wouldn't change a thing.<eos> - I would.
You know what, Cassie?<eos> I could say one thing with absolute certainty.<eos> And what's that, Ramse?<eos> James Cole is loyal. To a fault.<eos> That's a rare thing.<eos> He beats himself up for what he turned you into, and you want to hate him for it.<eos> I don't hate him.<eos> Forgive him.<eos> Like he did me.<eos> Like he would for you.
You think they were motive?<eos> I don't know, you tell me.<eos> Both artifacts were known to be vessels of the powers of the gods.<eos> I have a book on pantheistic deities back at the trailer.<eos> I'll grab it, check back in.<eos> Okay, I'll talk to you later.<eos> A Franklin stove.<eos> I thought you said Leeds hated the man.<eos> Why would he have his face in his kitchen?<eos> He wouldn't.
You don't interrupt a meeting with the Secretary of State.<eos> I can end Dunbar's campaign.<eos> We can end it today.<eos> How?<eos> If I deliver, will you keep me on?<eos> You tell me how first.<eos> Have a seat, Martha.<eos> I've had second thoughts about your resignation.<eos> Would you like to remain as attorney general?<eos> Yes, I would.
He's gonna need to deal with this immediately.<eos> Or it puts his plan to re-brand in jeopardy.<eos> Defying his orders... it's a huge challenge to his authority.<eos> He's not gonna want to deal with this in public.<eos> Bet you the first person he goes to see is the owner of that bracelet.<eos> What, so your strategy is just to sit here, paralyzed, hoping that Cutter leads us to the suspect?<eos> What a terrible idea.<eos> Hmm, you think so?<eos> I do, I mean, for one, even though Cutter's no brain surgeon, surely he wouldn't just...<eos> Wouldn't what?
The first time you have word-sex, it's nice.<eos> -But, it's just so much better when you really know somebody.<eos> So, you feel like you really know him.<eos> Sure, I do.<eos> My mom always said she knew my dad wanted sex when he didn't ask for seconds at dinner.<eos> And my dad said he knew my mom wanted sex when she got me and my sister Blockbuster videos.<eos> I always wanted to know someone that well.<eos> Yeah... me, too.<eos> So, your parents would talk to you about sex?<eos> Mine would never.
You think you're a man now?<eos> I dare you.<eos> Put me out of my misery.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it.<eos> Do it, do it. Do it!<eos> Look at these people!<eos> They no longer support me!<eos> Look!<eos> Why would they?
So, they said that he said that she said...<eos> That's a little light on the PC, don't you think, fellas?<eos> She was also picked up previously for manufacturing fake IDs.<eos> Fake IDs.<eos> So was my 16-year-old grandson.<eos> Jeez.<eos> Your Honor, we're holding her on a misdemeanor.<eos> She's gonna make bail on Monday, and I'm certain she is gonna skip town.<eos> And you'd like to sneak a little peek inside her domicile before that happens.<eos> Yes, sir, I would.
How do you sleep at night? Knowing you've destroyed so many people's lives?<eos> I don't.<eos> Do you have anyone in your life that you care about?<eos> I used to have someone in my life that I cared about.<eos> My girlfriend, Jenny.<eos> We were gonna get married, have kids someday.<eos> But after I got hit by that wave from the particle accelerator, all my dreams ended.<eos> You know, I see her sometimes, walking down the street.<eos> She doesn't even recognize me.<eos> But why would she?
I intend to.<eos> This is what comes of an empress absent royal blood.<eos> Garish displays of opulence... more befitting concubine than queen.<eos> We have a chance to restore honor to the empire.<eos> My head is heavy with the weight of this decision.<eos> When Kublai's mother, Sorkaktani, stole the Khanate from our house... anyone who sided with us was decimated in the cruelest of fashions.<eos> A wicked bunch they were.<eos> A wicked bunch they are.<eos> Sorkaktani demanded that my sister, Oghul Qaimish... pledge her fealty to the House of Tolui.<eos> She would not.
Not unless they had a satellite campus at 5307 Huntington Boulevard in Brooklyn.<eos> No more questions, Your Honor.<eos> Given that you smoked all this pot, Mr. Evans, isn't it possible that if Mike Ross commuted one day a week to Harvard Law that you might not remember that?<eos> I'd remember.<eos> Yeah, maybe you would, but you'd lie through your teeth about it anyway, wouldn't you?<eos> Objection.<eos> Mr. Evans, isn't it true that you're a long-time drug dealer and your testimony today is only happening because you signed a deal with Ms. Gibbs giving you immunity?<eos> Doesn't mean I'm lying.<eos> Because you wouldn't lie just to get out of going to prison?<eos> No, I would not.
- Just thought I'd ask.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Morning, Number Two.<eos> - So, this stalker thing, I called the police in Blackpool.<eos> - Blackpool?<eos> - Yes, a big tower, donkeys, kiss-me-quick hats.<eos> - Kiss your what?<eos> It's like a trilby, you know?<eos> No, why would you?
Oh, you've been doing your homework.<eos> First of all, I had nothing to do with the way that agency ended up.<eos> I didn't even know what was going on.<eos> You weren't aware that young girls that your company was supposedly looking after were becoming anorexic, bulimic?<eos> I was hardly ever there.<eos> I was a silent partner, no involvement apart from putting up half the money.<eos> - If I'd known what was going on...<eos> - You would have put a stop to it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, of course I would.
And I'm trying to be grateful for those two seconds, but I can't.<eos> I just hate this disease.<eos> I hate it that it took our friend.<eos> I hate it that I'm going to twice as many meetings, and they don't seem to help.<eos> I don't... even see the point anymore.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That's it.<eos> Why are we clapping?<eos> Who else would like to share?<eos> I would.
When do you have to make up your mind?<eos> Soon.<eos> - This is a little sudden.<eos> - I know.<eos> But would you back me if I said yes?<eos> If you win, what happens to you here?<eos> Well...<eos> I'd have to resign.<eos> Well, whoever replaces you won't know how we handle things.<eos> No, they would not.
And thank you for letting me do this here.<eos> It seemed like you didn't want to answer our questions in front of your husband.<eos> Can you blame me?<eos> Grace's book is about me.<eos> I told her about my flings because I felt bad for her.<eos> They were the only sex life she had.<eos> Only?<eos> You mean Andy couldn't?<eos> Worse.<eos> Wouldn't.
Darcy said I was her favorite customer.<eos> You're sure about that?<eos> Might've been "one of" her favorites.<eos> But she's your destiny, Ravi.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Little test here, Liv.<eos> Jennifer Lawrence.<eos> In my league?<eos> She'd be lucky to have you.<eos> Of course she would.
You just had a vision of her stealing from the cash register.<eos> And then screaming at her mum because she wouldn't foot the bill for her Paris boondoggle with her boyfriend.<eos> I saw a teenager upset with a parent. That's all.<eos> I bet Cher's inheritance would more than cover for art school or a pied-a-terre for two.<eos> When they come outside, let's find out if she has an alibi.<eos> She just lost her mother.<eos> She was letting poor Pam take the blame for her thievery.<eos> You won't do it.<eos> You won't ask a poor orphaned girl for her alibi?<eos> Clive would. But not you.
Where is she?<eos> On a mission.<eos> They all are.<eos> They got pretty strict marching orders.<eos> From?<eos> A goddess.<eos> We summoned, and she came.<eos> You mean, um, here? To your loft?<eos> You don't believe me.<eos> Shit, I wouldn't either.
What is it that you sell?<eos> Acne creams and ointments for Beechwood Pharmaceutical.<eos> Hmm. And you and Donna are estranged.<eos> What estranged you two?<eos> She had started doing modeling.<eos> Now, strictly speaking, I didn't mind most of it.<eos> But when she got into the pin-up stuff, that was too much, and we argued about that a lot.<eos> Well, what's the difference between that and stripping, really, right?<eos> And I asked her to stop.<eos> She wouldn't.
Why would you do that?<eos> Were you listening yesterday?<eos> A penis pump is precisely the kind of nonsense gadget... the kind of Band-Aid solution that the foundation does not condone.<eos> Well, that makes no sense.<eos> You got a broken arm, you don't walk around with it hanging from your shoulder.<eos> A broken pecker?<eos> Why not fix it?<eos> I'm sure Bill and Virginia would agree.<eos> No.<eos> They wouldn't.
But... for a while, I'm just gonna try to have some fun, break in my new heart.<eos> Relief in the Southland today as the L.A. Blood Bank crisis has been resolved and Todd Wilcox has been arrested.<eos> Health officials say new safeguards will go up to prevent this from ever happening again.<eos> Great work, team.<eos> There was a million things that could've gone wrong today.<eos> Speaking of "gone wrong," I just got my final rejection letter from a game show.<eos> I've got half a mind to sue.<eos> Half a mind is right...<eos> no lawyer would take that case.<eos> That one would.
I wasn't expecting Jim Gordon to stop by.<eos> You aren't supposed to be here, are you?<eos> How come you're not in jail?<eos> I agreed to testify against Professor Strange.<eos> In case you're about to ask, I don't know who really ran Indian Hill.<eos> I don't care who ran Indian Hill.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Fish Mooney.<eos> And why would I know how to find Fish Mooney?<eos> No reason you would.
I mean, if I could just shadow you for a day, maybe ask a few questions,<eos> I think that you could really help bring my skills up to... snuff.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Sorry.<eos> What if I gave up the lab?<eos> There's a storeroom downstairs that I could convert, so if you let me follow you on this case, lab's yours.<eos> Lab's mine?<eos> Okay. Deal.<eos> You can't slow me down, though.<eos> - I would never.
Nice.<eos> Jacob Scott.<eos> Consider this your first official meal as a free man. Chips ain't half bad.<eos> Trent Kort.<eos> How'd you like to help us find him?<eos> If I knew where Kort was, I'd have tried to put him away myself.<eos> How'd you two first meet?<eos> It was so long ago.<eos> Through work, I suppose.<eos> The way you would anyone.
Hey, may I have the envelope, please?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> There, what are you doing, come on, get in here.<eos> See, I told you, right?<eos> I told you!<eos> That's so good, Kevin.<eos> Oh... That felt good.<eos> Now all we need to do is just take a quick whack at the alt pass, huh?<eos> Oh, come on, we don't need an alt pass, what are you talking about?<eos> Why would you-- wh-wh-what, for what?
- No, you didn't.<eos> - Yeah, I... started it.<eos> You didn't, but, you know, that's fine.<eos> No...<eos> No, it's not fine.<eos> Not fine at all.<eos> What about you, kiddo?<eos> Saw that comin'.<eos> No... Come on, tell me. I wanna know.<eos> - No, you wouldn't.
I prefer the think about the ones I'm going to save.<eos> You don't want to catch Peter Lewis?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Brian was just a test case.<eos> He'll do this again. We have the same list.<eos> We're contacting everybody on it.<eos> But you're right.<eos> He will try to do this again.<eos> If you want to help catch him...<eos> Yeah, I would.
Yeah.<eos> What's up?<eos> When we were watching Crowley, we saw Henry Appley going to his house, he made--<eos> Henry's wife can't get hold of him.<eos> [Michael] Well, you spoke to Henry Appley, right?<eos> -So he knew Crowley was under suspicion?<eos> -Henry? What a holy mess.<eos> [Linda] According to the toxicology report, there were no drugs in Arne Durnst's blood.<eos> Unless Caitlin was lying to us.<eos> And why would she?
I'm not afraid of you.<eos> Okay, then why don't you tell me this, what's the best thing about having so much money?<eos> - What? - You heard me.<eos> You got the penthouse in Manhattan.<eos> You got the villa in the south of France.<eos> You get two yachts...<eos> - So what?<eos> - So what?<eos> So I wouldn't want to give all of that up.<eos> Would you, Mr. Miller?
I'll miss you, Gran. So, to remember you, I'll always wear this.<eos> [yelping]<eos> I've lost you a second time. And now, a few words from Gran's ex-boyfriend, Mow.<eos> [clears throat, grunts]<eos> Wow. I've never heard Mow open up like that before.<eos> Okay, I'm not gonna lie, Gran and I didn't always get along.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, I could stand here all day talking about how much I'll miss Mom.<eos> [cackling] But she would want us to move on.<eos> [groans] Like bonk I would.
Because I'm not comfortable leaving him here alone.<eos> Why?<eos> There's nothing in the house.<eos> What's he gonna do, smoke a bowl of Grape-Nuts?<eos> Don't give him ideas.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> Let me finish putting my shoes on.<eos> Slower.<eos> - Would anyone else like to share?<eos> - I would.
So are you.<eos> Uh, not... not... not lately I'm...<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Because you came up on mine once.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Well, why wouldn't you?<eos> I mean, we're... You're really close by.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I swiped left, so...<eos> No. Yeah. No, no, I would...
We, Rome, owe them an enormous debt.<eos> A gift of rich, fertile lands upon which to settle seems like the least the Empire can do.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Which is why I proposed--<eos> May I ask which areas you are considering?<eos> Etruria? Campania? Sardinia?<eos> Perhaps Macedonia?<eos> An excellent question, Senator.<eos> And to be honest, I haven't had the time to get into specifics.<eos> And why would you?
- [both] Root Beer Barrels! - [shutter clicking]<eos> You know, I never caught your name.<eos> Oh, it's Pee-wee.<eos> Pee-wee Herman.<eos> And you are?<eos> [laughs] Good one.<eos> Uh... what?<eos> Wait... you don't know who I am?<eos> How could I?<eos> Why would I?
Hello, friends!<eos> I was just...<eos> I was immersed in a game of bridge.<eos> Do you play?<eos> Sir, did you try to start your plane again?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I'm terribly sorry.<eos> I fear I have caused extensive damage to the house next door.<eos> Handcuffs?<eos> I'd rather not.
She always thought the one in print has been cropped a bit too much on the right.<eos> Right here.<eos> Oh, yes, yes.<eos> I see what she meant.<eos> So, when I write this article, I don't think I can avoid mentioning how she died.<eos> That is wasn't really an accident.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, are you saying that you want to write that she, killed herself?<eos> Gene, I don't want to be a part of romanticizing what we do.<eos> Isabelle wouldn't either.
Yes, but before that, you has made your mistake.<eos> And many mistakes before that.<eos> - Wait, I have not--<eos> - Many, many, many, many!<eos> Actually--<eos> Many mistakes before that.<eos> - So, I still has to erase you.<eos> - Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.
- Wait, I have not--<eos> - Many, many, many, many!<eos> Actually--<eos> Many mistakes before that.<eos> - So, I still has to erase you.<eos> - Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> - But I would not.
Actually--<eos> Many mistakes before that.<eos> - So, I still has to erase you.<eos> - Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> But I would not.
- Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> But I would not.<eos> We could go round and round.<eos> Let's do it again!<eos> - But I would not.
Aye, John, just as you asked when you wrote.<eos> We've never a bairn of our own.<eos> God knows it's not for want of trying.<eos> Ill blood breeds ill.<eos> Aye, but it'll be long ere I'll have to kill myself because my man beds me like a breeding sow!<eos> You dirty bitch!<eos> They won't go back to school!<eos> Why won't you go back to school?<eos> Why should they go back?<eos> I wouldn't!
Hey, I'm always gonna be your sister. Aaagh! Let's call it a night, then.<eos> Okay.<eos> Eli?<eos> I'm not going.<eos> What?<eos> I'm not going.<eos> You're not going?<eos> I can't leave Eva.<eos> Nell, would she leave you?<eos> No, she wouldn't.
Have you lived in France long?<eos> Too long.<eos> I lived in England for a while, before I ended up here.<eos> But I am originally from the States.<eos> My husband seems to forget.<eos> It hasn't been used in a while.<eos> Your visit is... unexpected.<eos> Good God.<eos> I didn't have time to clean the room properly.<eos> Well, why would I?
Come on.<eos> Bring them in, John.<eos> Grab this one.<eos> Miss Everdene's here now, so you better do your best work.<eos> I'm looking at you, Coggan.<eos> Yeah, you keep quiet, Liddy.<eos> What you doing?<eos> Perhaps you'd care to lend a hand?<eos> You don't think I would?<eos> No, you wouldn't.
You see, if he's cheating in the races, then he's cheating on us as well.<eos> And if he didn't really win, they don't really owe him the money.<eos> Exactly!<eos> Well done, Alex.<eos> You've finally caught up.<eos> But let us not forget this.<eos> Lance Armstrong has never tested positive.<eos> Can you imagine how disastrous it would be if he did?<eos> - He wouldn't like it.<eos> - Nobody would.
You have to try to move forward.<eos> I won't be gone long.<eos> Call if you need me, okay?<eos> I sure would.<eos> No, don't even think about it.<eos> All right, enough, you two.<eos> What would you guys do without me?<eos> We'd probably kill each other.<eos> Would my princess care to lick the spoon?<eos> I sure would.
I'll pick you up at 8:00?<eos> Great.<eos> Only thing is I'm not supposed to use the work van after hours, I don't want your dad to see me driving it.<eos> So is it cool if I pick you up around the corner?<eos> Yeah, I'll see you in 20 minutes.<eos> I'm gonna bring a friend.<eos> She's cool, she just moved here.<eos> Rose?<eos> Would my princess care to lick the spoon?<eos> I sure would.
Rose?<eos> Would my princess care to lick the spoon?<eos> I sure would.<eos> No, don't even think about it.<eos> All right, enough, you two.<eos> What would you guys do without me?<eos> We'd probably kill each other.<eos> Would my princess care to lick the spoon?<eos> Rose'?<eos> -l sure would.
I need to show that bartender how to make a cocktail.<eos> Okay, there's definitely something different about her<eos> - that now I'm worried.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Tessa.<eos> She never liked to drink.<eos> Now she's some shot-loving world traveler.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Would you want to be judged based on who you were in high school?<eos> I wouldn't.
But she's having a big gallery show in LA.<eos> Karen Alvarado.<eos> That's such a pretty name.<eos> An architect and an artist.<eos> You guys are like the perfect couple.<eos> And she's so hot.<eos> You must have sex, like, all day.<eos> - Bel!<eos> - What?<eos> I would.
- Eduardo, please--<eos> - This is a farce.<eos> Please.<eos> Let me deal with this.<eos> Please.<eos> Fine.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> We can at least begin a discussion, right?<eos> Even though you never stated it, surely you'd like to see the bombings stop.<eos> - Yes. Yes, I would.
Yeah, you want to put it up a couple of inches on your side, love.<eos> Okeydokey.<eos> You really think anyone's gonna pay to see this rich nancy sing show tunes?<eos> I wouldn't.
Well, in that case, must have been almost two years.<eos> Two years?<eos> That's a... That's a long time to live with discomfort.<eos> Well, there it is.<eos> You think I'm crazy.<eos> I never said that.<eos> No, you didn't, because you're very polite. But you think it.<eos> Otherwise you wouldn't be talking about commitment.<eos> - You find that idea distressing?<eos> - Who the hell wouldn't?
My father was gone.<eos> She was alone.<eos> But... she put me behind her, and she faced these men.<eos> They knew they could kill her.<eos> But they also looked her in the eyes and knew she would take at least one of them with her.<eos> And they left.<eos> Because none of them wanted to be that one.<eos> Who can say if it is we who make the choice, or the choice that makes us?<eos> ...the ceremony.<eos> The last thing we would...
I...<eos> I see that. I'm sick of you diminishing my relationship, Trista.<eos> What Keith and I have is real.<eos> - I know it's not conventional.<eos> - Or right.<eos> But I caught a break with Keith. And I'm gonna make it worked, okay.<eos> You know I wouldn't have to dress up like a fish. if someone would represent me.<eos> I knew this was going to coming up.<eos> Just putting the agency on my resume would be life changing. Tris.<eos> It probably wouldn't, Amaya.
Goyisha name?<eos> - Well... - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it reeks of old money.<eos> A finishing school girl.<eos> But you aren't?<eos> Maybe I am.<eos> No one knows and I don't want them to.<eos> When you read Genevieve Everidge, she's anything you want her to be.<eos> And I doubt people would feel the same way about Esther Kohn, a shirtmaker's daughter from Pittsfield.<eos> I would.
You've had someone following me.<eos> And for good reason.<eos> You don't understand what I...<eos> You should be pregnant!<eos> Did he threaten you?<eos> - Then what happened?<eos> I just want to leave this house and never come back.<eos> My father isn't a man you want to upset.<eos> I don't care.<eos> And neither would I.
There's no need to thank me.<eos> I would do anything for the woman that I love...<eos> Even get a drink with Louis Litt.<eos> You here to talk about Anderton Software?<eos> Because your 24-hour Liberty Rail pass is up.<eos> Then I guess it's a good thing that just came in the mail for me.<eos> What is it?<eos> Maintenance records showing they replaced the heat sensors on all of their trains within six weeks after the derailment.<eos> Now, why would they do that if they never failed a safety test?<eos> They wouldn't.
Bad memories.<eos> What do these grounds hold for you?<eos> Hannibal wanted to kill that man for what he did to Mischa.<eos> I wouldn't let him take his life, so Hannibal left his life with me.<eos> He was curious if you would kill.<eos> I imagine he still is.<eos> What were you like as a young man?<eos> I was rooting for Mephistopheles and contemptuous of Faust.<eos> Would you like to talk about your first spring lamb?<eos> Would you?
There are waters in Nanda Parbat. They've permitted Ra's to live for over a hundred years.<eos> And in rare instances told in legend, those waters have been used to restore the dead to life.<eos> He offered to use the Lazarus Pit on Thea, didn't he?<eos> Lazarus, as in from the Bible, Lazarus?<eos> The pit's real.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> It can save Thea. Right.<eos> But only if you become the new Ra's.<eos> Okay, well, even if a magic hot tub were not crazy talk we're not gonna let you join the League of Psychotic Murderers even if it is to save Thea.<eos> Which this wouldn't.
He's at residential school.<eos> Yes, well, I... I really wanted four myself, but... (DISTORTED VOICE) And lost two.<eos> Is there someone there?<eos> Stuck-up cow, that's who.<eos> I had a daughter named Janet.<eos> (NORMAL VOICE) I know.<eos> What's the news, Maurice?<eos> (DISTORTED VOICE) Sour old bitch.<eos> Would anybody like another slice of cake?<eos> - Ooh, I would actually.
Yes, well I... I really wanted four myself, but...<eos> And lost two.<eos> Is there someone there?<eos> Stuck-up cow, that's who.<eos> I had a daughter... ..named Janet.<eos> I know.<eos> What's the news, Maurice?<eos> Sour old bitch.<eos> Would anybody like another slice of cake?<eos> Ooh, I would actually.
Well, it won't be boring if I'm with you.<eos> And besides, it'll be good to spend some time together.<eos> We spend a lot of time together. [ Chuckles ]<eos> Mm. I want this to be more than just sex.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Well, I just -- I figured a guy your age would wanna keep things casual.<eos> Well, I'm not like most guys my age.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> So, Mrs. Powell, you'd like to adopt a child.<eos> Yes, I would. Very much.
Maybe.<eos> What's the scam?<eos> What kind of a man do you think I am?<eos> There's always a scam, Frank.<eos> All right, yes.<eos> I'm very good at sticking it to the man, but this woman...<eos> I don't want to stick anything to her.<eos> Except myself, but she won't let me.<eos> Why would anybody want to be with you?<eos> Well, why wouldn't they?
This court has reviewed your probation report.<eos> Does other counsel wish to be heard?<eos> Your Honor, defense would like to reiterate that this is defendant's first arrest.<eos> He has never been in trouble before and that he has an IQ of barely functional intelligence.<eos> Would the defendant like to say anything?<eos> Charles?<eos> - Chuckie.<eos> - What? Would you like to say anything before sentencing?<eos> Okay.<eos> I would, Your Honor.
Okay.<eos> Uh, but you never reported this in your first interview.<eos> I wanted to protect Nate.<eos> Protect him?<eos> When Nate and I arrived at the house, Sam was in the driveway getting into his car, about to leave town.<eos> Sam?<eos> Sam was drunk, yelling at me.<eos> Nate got out of his car to try to calm him down.<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam wouldn't.
Yeah, three times.<eos> That's so sweet.<eos> There you are.<eos> It's you.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> I almost didn't get in 'cause my license is expired.<eos> They thought I was a Muslim spy or something.<eos> Um, well, um-- I'm glad you came.<eos> You know, I wasn't sure you would when I called you.<eos> Of course I would.
We could've handled her in a way that would've kept everyone safe.<eos> It wasn't fair to us, Fitz.<eos> We had a right to know.<eos> A right to know?<eos> Is that the same way that Sif and the Kree had a right to know?<eos> I think this situation's a little bit different, mate.<eos> No, you would've done to her exactly what they wanted to.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do know that!<eos> They would... You...
They will brand you ... all of you.<eos> You have power here ...<eos> lots of it.<eos> To do what?<eos> Openly attack them?<eos> - Blast their planes out of the sky?<eos> - Well, for a start.<eos> Our daughter wouldn't want that.<eos> And my people would never - blindly follow me into a war.<eos> - I would.
- Any idea where I can find her?<eos> - If I did, it'd be on the front page.<eos> The Russian that Blake shot in interrogation, there was a Chinese man in the back of his cab in an alley.<eos> Blind, carried a backpack.<eos> I've seen those guys around town.<eos> Drugs in the pack?<eos> Little busy to check.<eos> Would make sense.<eos> Nobody'd look at a blind man twice.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
Why are you asking me about this?<eos> Well, because Singh's on his honeymoon and you're the only other person I can trust to know this.<eos> Okay, what are you asking me to do?<eos> I need to clear a route through the city.<eos> - Barricades, police cars. The works.<eos> - What am I to tell people?<eos> President's in town?<eos> - I don't know. You think they'll believe you?<eos> - No, Joe.<eos> They wouldn't.
Where's my wife?<eos> Facing death, and all you're worried about is your girl.<eos> I like that.<eos> Tell me she's ok.<eos> She's good.<eos> I can tell you guys have something special like me and Daisy.<eos> You ever cheat on Anna?<eos> What?<eos> A lot of guys do.<eos> I never would.
Katrina: The smallest details Fill in the largest canvas.<eos> Prior to his death,<eos> Grant was rebuked Over the condition of this painting.<eos> The artist's tools.<eos> The blade. That red paint was not there before.<eos> Blood.<eos> It's wet.<eos> The art docent Identified this as a self-portrait Of the artist who painted it.<eos> Not only would a surgeon have an understanding Of human anatomy...<eos> So, too, would an artist.
S-So can I just take any house? Or...<eos> Well, this one's Phil's.<eos> And mine's the one across the street with the broken door. Because... Phil broke it.<eos> I'm gonna fix your door, Carol.<eos> Well, he's not very handy, so I'm not gonna hold my breast.<eos> Breath.<eos> Why would I hold my breath?<eos> I would die. Ca hold your breast?<eos> It's "holding your breath" because there's danger if you hold your breath.<eos> I wouldn't.
Charles Laney, handled the Harrison bankruptcy.<eos> See what you can find out.<eos> Will do, and I have something kind of interesting.<eos> Talked to Lieutenant Bradey in arson, says the weird fire pattern sounds a lot like a case an old partner of his was following.<eos> Same M.O. He was never able to crack it.<eos> Says his partner was a little obsessed with nailing this firebug.<eos> You know, the one that always got away.<eos> Let's talk to this cop.<eos> If he'll talk to you.<eos> Why wouldn't he?
I need to pick up some tide on my way home?<eos> You're sure?<eos> No arousal or...?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Smells like my old boyfriend's hamper.<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you, Beth.<eos> Lester's sweat strikes out again.<eos> I'm starting to lose hope.<eos> Well, I wouldn't yet.
He would never set up Genevieve.<eos> He's still in love with her.<eos> He keeps boxes of her old stuff lying around.<eos> - Ooh, can we look at, smell, and handle them?<eos> I mean, you know, for the investigation.<eos> We're cops. - Please, take the boxes.<eos> I want them out of here.<eos> - Oh, okay, great.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know where he was on July 21st, would you?<eos> - Actually, I would.
Activity in the amygdala has been shown to increase with hormonal changes during pregnancy.<eos> So... you're saying I was right.<eos> Essentially, yes.<eos> I'm six months pregnant.<eos> I have to be.<eos> I just didn't... just didn't want to be.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna argue with that.<eos> I tried to convince myself that maybe I was having twins.<eos> But the doctor would know if I were having twins.<eos> Yes, she would.
Lisa...<eos> Homer...<eos> I think we should take down Everscream Terrors.<eos> Wha-<eos> - W-We... we can't!<eos> I'm the Mozart of Halloween decorations, and tonight is the Super Bowl.<eos> Lisa's in a bad place.<eos> You know how sensitive she is.<eos> We don't want her to go back to... Tailee.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
Odin!<eos> Use your blades, try to jam it!<eos> Come on!<eos> Quick!<eos> Pull! I'm trying!<eos> Quickly!<eos> They took half the village.<eos> Yeah, and it was the good half.<eos> They went willingly to Valhalla... as would we all.<eos> I wouldn't.
You have to listen to me.<eos> - I can't!<eos> This just kind of feels like one big coincidence, doesn't it?<eos> You working here, hunting down aliens, me being one?<eos> I... I can't help but think the real reason that you were recruited was because of me.<eos> They recruited me because my background in bio-engineering makes me an expert on alien physiology.<eos> And, yeah, it helps that I shared a bathroom with one.<eos> I'm leaving now.<eos> Unless you wanna try and stop me.<eos> Which I wouldn't.
Yes, thank you.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Do you post your own letters? - Ha!<eos> It was vital it went off today and I'm never very good at delegating.<eos> As a matter of fact, I'm glad to see you.<eos> I'd value your advice.<eos> I've had a letter from the Royal Yorkshire Hospital, asking if I'd head the new Board of Charitable Donors.<eos> We'd be working alongside.<eos> Well, that's if I stay the almoner, once we've amalgamated.<eos> Of course you would.
Yusuf told me his biggest fear was to disappear, which is what happens if he gets caught and sent to Guantanamo.<eos> There's no justice in that.<eos> His story never gets told, and he never gets revenge on...<eos> What?<eos> What? What is it?<eos> Senator Darnell.<eos> That's his justice. He's going after Darnell.<eos> Yes, but if he does that, he'll be arrested.<eos> He will never get to tell his story.<eos> No, he would.
Can you come get us?<eos> You'll have to sit tight.<eos> We can't get to you until after the storm.<eos> There may be flooding.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> - Sir?<eos> - Not now, Andrew.<eos> But, sir, if Ted and George could get to the satellite tower and install the RDS, that could stop the flooding.<eos> Andrew, that's the most ridiculous thing I...<eos> Actually, it would.
When we're focused on our feet, we're distracted from our brains.<eos> The body is spinning, the mind is still.<eos> My wife doesn't need waltzing lessons.<eos> It's been three months.<eos> I've yet to hear a diagnosis, much less a prognosis.<eos> It's fascinating, really.<eos> - The science is so new.<eos> - Psychiatry, is it a science?<eos> Dr. Winter, would you like to discuss this privately?<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
We deal with Bobby's thing first.<eos> Your statement's gonna have to wait.<eos> Tell your dad's guys. We do one thing at a time.<eos> How's Bobby?<eos> Severe concussion.<eos> You guys fucking broke his skull.<eos> Don't knows when he will wake up.<eos> Do you think one million will do?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Ten million wouldn't.
I also heard from Alfredo.<eos> And?<eos> His recuperation is going well-- he says he'll be back from his sister's next week.<eos> And he doesn't seem to hold the Oscar business against me, which I think's quite sporting.<eos> I also narrowed down the number of prisons I might be sent to if the DA convicts me of felonious assault.<eos> Each one of them, I'm happy to report, has a recovery program, so I shan't want for meetings.<eos> Oscar Rankin kidnapped Alfredo, and he tortured you.<eos> It doesn't matter-- you're not going to prison.<eos> A week ago, you'd have said I'd never relapse.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Hey, Toby.<eos> I'm tiny Rick.<eos> I'm new.<eos> Hey oh -- go easy on me.<eos> Ha ha.<eos> Just kiddin'.<eos> I like your straightforward style and that lab coat's pretty cool.<eos> Summer.<eos> He knows my name!<eos> Why wouldn't he?
The Darkness...<eos> It's been locked away since the dawn of creation.<eos> And now it's free.<eos> Whatever's wrong, Dean will fix it.<eos> God help us.<eos> I wouldn't count on that.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who would? The Winchesters?
Doc!<eos> Thanks for volunteering to be our early warning alarm<eos> This is crazy!<eos> Let us go!<eos> You'll never see us again!<eos> You got that right.<eos> Look.<eos> You and I both know what happens if I let you go.<eos> You'll find your party and then turn around and come right after me and my family.<eos> No, we wouldn't.
What's your name?<eos> Ray.<eos> You gonna help us both out and keep quiet, Ray?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let me hear you say it.<eos> I'm gonna help us both out and keep quiet.<eos> Good.<eos> I don't want to have to come back.<eos> If I come back I got no choice but to give you citation or ticket or worse, place you under arrest.<eos> I'd much rather not.
LYDIA: No one is going to think anything less of Stevie.<eos> Well, that's a big relief.<eos> We're just trying to manage the embarrassment.<eos> Oh, Lydia, I think that ship has sailed.<eos> After your outburst today, I'd have to agree.<eos> What?<eos> Now we're blaming Henry for defending his daughter?<eos> Why don't we talk about the fact that your son has an unsecured phone?<eos> Who'd like another cocktail?<eos> - I would.
You brought me here to atone.<eos> I am atoning.<eos> And look.<eos> Here he is.<eos> Lieutenant, I understand you.<eos> If someone tried to kill me, I would not rest until I took my revenge.<eos> But you're not going to kill my doctor, are you?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> I would.
Well, that makes sense.<eos> If he was willing to kill Justin, he'd already have the Van Gogh and he wouldn't have asked me to steal the fake one.<eos> Hold on.<eos> The Van Gogh you recovered is the forgery?<eos> How do you know about the forgery?<eos> Lorenzo, you are in a world of trouble.<eos> Your best bet is to tell us everything you know now.<eos> I have spent my entire adult life searching for that painting.<eos> When I heard it was coming up for auction, I tried to get my boss to buy it.<eos> But he wouldn't.
Now?<eos> Your dad has all kinds of plans.<eos> Bill, why don't you tell him?<eos> Well, there are a lot of great social programs<eos> I've been in contact with, helped me find some housing, they're gonna help me find a job.<eos> You know, it is so great to finally spend some time with you, Karen.<eos> It would be even better if you lived closer to Max, you know?<eos> We could... We could do this all the time.<eos> Right, I'm sure Max would just love that.<eos> Oh, he would.
- ...one of the conference rooms here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Mark.<eos> - Hi, how are you?<eos> You testified about why the FBI would have any interest in this case in the first place.<eos> - You recall that?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> You testified that one of the FBI's concerns was that if there's a corrupt cop on the street doing something illegal, and certainly planting evidence to frame somebody would be illegal, right?<eos> - Would you agree with me?<eos> OK. - Yes, I would.
Sell orders have all been entered.<eos> It's time.<eos> We will activate our asset immediately.<eos> And this must be Aleksandr.<eos> The prodigal returns.<eos> He may not be a regular churchgoer, but he's a good man, my son.<eos> He just turned 21.<eos> And he already has a job at the auto plant.<eos> It was stupid to mention the job.<eos> A real mother would.
Do you remember the last time we were here and I turned on the radio?<eos> - "Sweet Jane. "<eos> - Yeah.<eos> God, I knew a song would come in and then it did.<eos> - Clear as day.<eos> - I know.<eos> As if it was cued up for us.<eos> You know, I used to feel that way about everything.<eos> I'd just blindly trust in life to work out.<eos> And then it would.
Theo and I have been talking it over and even though you guys aren't technically married... you know, you're doing the whole Goldie Hawn thing. You know, you've been together the longest and you are young - and you are fun...<eos> - So fun.<eos> And, you know, if we're being responsible, you're stable.<eos> And what we wanted to ask you is...<eos> Ready?<eos> Would you be our baby's godparents?<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - No.<eos> - Sure...<eos> - Yeah, we would.
Hello, Mr. Baker.<eos> Have you saved some of those sweets for Granny?<eos> I ate all the sweets and half a loaf of bread.<eos> So I see.<eos> Now, tell me, where did you get that beautiful cape?<eos> - My granny made it for me.<eos> - Is that so?<eos> I would love a red cape like that.<eos> You would look pretty foolish.<eos> I would, wouldn't I?
Why not, indeed?<eos> So you are outlaws?<eos> Yes, we are the last of them.<eos> The last, not yet King Harald find has ruin.<eos> See when Harald conquered at all my father did not give up like the others, he fought.<eos> When he was murdered, I took his ship and almost left of our men I let our home.<eos> And now the King has put the prize your heads.<eos> Yes.<eos> And what will you do with the woman when King Dunchaid does not pay?<eos> What kind of father would not?
Because I know what you face out here, sir.<eos> You cannot be a man down.<eos> I respect what you're saying, but I don't give a damn about D.F<eos> You understand?<eos> I'm a soldier.<eos> I will fight and die by your side, Commander.<eos> Welcome to 37.<eos> It is an honor, sir.<eos> The men seem like they'd follow Spears into hell.<eos> Would you?
Now, I know that was an emergency.<eos> But we have an emergency here, okay?<eos> We are hemorrhaging money.<eos> Hemorrhaging money, man.<eos> - People are getting upset.<eos> - Stan, this is my life.<eos> This is my life.<eos> And this is how you pay for your life.<eos> If you were a nobody, still just David King's kid, I wouldn't care what you did.<eos> No one would.
They gave us their word.<eos> It means nothing.<eos> It's worth taking a chance.<eos> They might go away.<eos> If what I think will happen happens, they will be able to stay out there for days while we're stuck in here with no food or water.<eos> What do you think, Tom?<eos> I think you need to leave.<eos> - Tom!<eos> - If he left, they'd go!<eos> No, they wouldn't.
If you do that... the bucket will fall.<eos> Go to Callie and give her The phone.<eos> stop pushing me.<eos> Take.<eos> Callie, do you see me?<eos> Hello?<eos> Last night I passed out and locked in a storage room by Jasper.<eos> What?<eos> He will kill you.<eos> No, he would never.
Do you understand?<eos> I want to know his fucking name!<eos> Because, I swear, I'll rip your head off.<eos> - Tell me!<eos> - I don't know what you're fucking on about!<eos> Just tell him, Eggsy!<eos> Fuck off!<eos> Fuck off, Michelle!<eos> I could kill you right now... and no one in the whole world will notice!<eos> But I would.
best receptionist I've ever had. - Yeah.<eos> - Good news is I had my tubes tied in '08. So, clearly, she's also a fucking liar.<eos> - Right. That's tough.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> You want a coconut water?<eos> - Um...<eos> - You OK?<eos> I'm alright. I'm alright.<eos> - Do you want a drink?<eos> - I would... No.
I found your dog.<eos> He was in our neighbour's bushes.<eos> Dead.<eos> The dog was old.<eos> What's your name, kid?<eos> Brooks.<eos> Brooks, huh?<eos> Your parents just let you run around at night, Brooks?<eos> They'd have to care.<eos> Wouldn't they?
He was in our neighbour's bushes.<eos> Dead.<eos> The dog was old.<eos> What's your name, kid?<eos> Brooks.<eos> Brooks, huh?<eos> Your parents just let you run around at night, Brooks?<eos> They'd have to care.<eos> Wouldn't they?<eos> They would.
He was encouraging them.<eos> The blackouts.<eos> The lost time.<eos> It was strategic.<eos> It was planned.<eos> You would only see a seizure response in a brain afflicted with photosensitive epilepsy.<eos> Or afflicted by something just as damaging.<eos> Like encephalitis.<eos> That would suggest a radically unorthodox form of therapy.<eos> Yes, it would.
Sure.<eos> Oh. Let me call you back, okay?<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Morning, Jane.<eos> Cab to a crime scene?<eos> That's very Cosmopolitan of you.<eos> Well, my car wouldn't start.<eos> Well, of course it wouldn't.
Every winter, we begged for protection from the creatures who invaded our village searching for food.<eos> Well, tonight... we will finally have something decent to feed them.<eos> Yeah!<eos> We can't just leave her there.<eos> We don't even know what they're planning.<eos> Yeah! - Though I grant it's not looking good.<eos> - Alice...<eos> If we were the ones tied to stakes, do you think she'd lift a finger to help us?<eos> Well, you're right.<eos> She wouldn't.
But we're not her.<eos> Think about what you're doing.<eos> Feed me to these creatures tonight, tomorrow you will be no better off than you are today.<eos> But you hold me to ransom, and the reward that I'll fetch will fill your bellies for years to come.<eos> I'm worth more alive than I am dead.<eos> All right.<eos> Who?<eos> Who would pay to save your life?<eos> I'm the Queen!<eos> Surely somebody would!
Dad!<eos> You've made a terrible mistake.<eos> That is not my mother!<eos> Settle down, Burt.<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> I was doing this for your mother.<eos> I don't see how lip-wrestling with the editor of Casserole Today could be for her.<eos> See, I throw the judges a little sugar so your mother wins.<eos> I think she'd prefer you kept your sugar to yourself.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
But they didn't participate in our conversations, so how would they know?<eos> So you're saying that you only gave religious counsel.<eos> That's how I choose to interpret it.<eos> The President and his wife have never once attended your church.<eos> - They're not even the same denomination.<eos> - Irrelevant.<eos> Not legally speaking.<eos> I'm certain I can convince a judge to issue a subpoena on the grounds that you weren't their legitimate spiritual advisor.<eos> Which is your prerogative, but I can appeal.<eos> - And I would.
That's what's causing Rosemary's problems.<eos> He wants to do an MRI scan tomorrow.<eos> This is the doctor that you slept with, right?<eos> Suddenly he's an expert?<eos> I have slept with you too.<eos> Just because I have sex with someone doesn't mean I can't see them for what they are.<eos> - Julie. - He's a good doctor.<eos> You know me, okay?<eos> You know that I would never let anything hurt Rosemary ever.<eos> What, and I would?
I don't know.<eos> I don't want to speak ill of my fellow clansmen, with a "C." But...<eos> Roman... I think he's maybe one of the most arrogant, obnoxious people I've ever met in my entire life.<eos> And that's just the stuff I liked about him.<eos> Definitely doesn't lack in confidence.<eos> Baby, can you help me? Yeah.<eos> Well...<eos> He's got enough ego for the both of us and the cat.<eos> He would make a good character though.<eos> He would, right?
I'll do it!<eos> I swear to God I'll do it!<eos> Your dad used to do this to you?<eos> Well, it was with a Cabbage Patch doll and an ax.<eos> But same idea. Trust me.<eos> I was never late for kindergarten again.<eos> Come on.<eos> I second Marshall's vow.<eos> I will never, ever get that drunk again.<eos> Yeah. She would.
Stand by.<eos> - According to valdes, This meeting's supposed to start in an hour.<eos> - Yeah, and anibal's still up in his house Eating pints of cherry fucking garcia.<eos> How the hell are they gonna have a meeting without him?<eos> - That's because there is no meeting.<eos> Valdes is full of shit. [laughs]<eos> - Who'd you rather bang, valdes or frankie?<eos> - Frankie don't take dick. - I know!<eos> But let's just say she does.<eos> Or she would.
[Gouby] I hate when they do that.<eos> [Lechenault] No security on!<eos> [man] Just gonna get close like that.<eos> [Gouby] So we speak English tonight.<eos> [man] No, Français!<eos> [man] My Français is a bit shit.<eos> What do you define yourself as?<eos> [John] Some people would say I'm a mercenary.<eos> [Gouby] You're a mercenary?<eos> [John] Some people would... some people wouldn't.
Are you sleeping?<eos> Sort of.<eos> Yeah-- I-I don't know.<eos> But you're comfortable here?<eos> The Advocacy Center is committed to giving you anything that you need.<eos> You know, you're entitled to a leave of absence from school.<eos> No, I'll go.<eos> To school?<eos> No one expects you to.<eos> My parents would.
She'll fit right in.<eos> If anyone asks you where the baby came from, You found her at the castle door.<eos> That's all you know. Do you understand?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll say nothing.<eos> Did you see the baby's foot?<eos> It's a mark that pagans sometimes put On their newborns, to distinguish the baby In the eyes of their gods.<eos> Isabel must have put it there.<eos> Who knows of this tradition?<eos> Any pagan would.
As you know, there are 2 teams on 2 different islands wearing 2 different colors.<eos> You'll remember that last season we determined who would be in which team before anyone came to the island.<eos> But this season the teams will be decided by drawing lots held in just a moment.<eos> We've had a great selection process.<eos> Let me congratulate you all.<eos> You'll make your own luck.<eos> - The drawing lots are a good idea.<eos> - Thank you, Recep.<eos> Who would like to be team leader?<eos> I would.
Haven't even showered. Okay, she's right.<eos> Instead of having a shower, getting her hair done, and finding a cute dress to wear to her birthday, she's dealing with another Vincent mess, and yes, I-I blew the surprise because of him.<eos> Yeah, I already kind of knew about it, so...<eos> Well, fan-friggin-tastic.<eos> Maybe you should hang back.<eos> No, I am fine.<eos> You sure? Because once we set foot on this houseboat, we need to remain calm.<eos> Yes, I will be fine.<eos> I could walk in on them in flagrante, and I would be fine.<eos> I wouldn't.
The recordings of the girls talking?<eos> Do you have anything to do with that?<eos> I heard Mrs. Hoving hired a private investigator.<eos> I paid money to make him and the evidence disappear.<eos> So, you "took care of it."<eos> I was trying to protect her.<eos> But she didn't want your protection, did she?<eos> She was always very honest.<eos> You know, she said I'd pay for it.<eos> That we all would.
How do I know you're telling the truth?<eos> I'll turn the camera off.<eos> I think you know the Doctor's very powerful, and you can imagine he has many people in many places to help him.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Finn, I know you care about this girl.<eos> You're smart and you're able to think ahead, so you can imagine what will happen when she wakes up, tied up, with us here.<eos> She'll think we did it.<eos> No, no, we'll explain to her how we rescued her...<eos> And she won't believe it.<eos> No one would.
But?<eos> I saw Pottinger's face when we sat across the table.<eos> He was laughing at me with his eyes.<eos> He knew something about the situation that I did not.<eos> I briefly considered the possibility that somehow you had betrayed me to him.<eos> But that rang hollow.<eos> You're a pal.<eos> So you think that Stahma...<eos> She wouldn't dare.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
- Lie to your wives about it.<eos> You don't like fireworks?<eos> Bombs bursting in air? No, not much.<eos> You read a paper of mine.<eos> "New Approach to Nuclear Cosmology."<eos> - Right.<eos> -Your approach wasn't...<eos> New.<eos> The judges of the Forbes prize didn't see a problem.<eos> They wouldn't.
Alright. Okay.<eos> Okay. There we go.<eos> Need a break? No.<eos> Oh you are a better tracker than I gave you credit for Protector.<eos> This is the end of the line Jaworski.<eos> How do you figure?<eos> It's just you and me.<eos> I like my odds.<eos> You want to watch her die try something.<eos> I wouldn't.
Uh-huh. Well, she got a point, right?<eos> I can live with that.<eos> What?<eos> Brother, I thought you were shot.<eos> I was.<eos> In my thigh.<eos> Thigh?<eos> That don't count.<eos> For you?<eos> No, for you, it would not.
Stephanie and I played together as kids.<eos> What is she doing?<eos> I don't know, but, uh, you know, if you have nothing to hide, why would you be nervous?<eos> The McNamaras were good to me.<eos> Even if the estate sold, I still have a pension and severance package.<eos> Maybe you felt you deserved more.<eos> May I feel your mandible?<eos> It'll just take a second.<eos> Do I have to?<eos> I would.
Suzi made hotcakes.<eos> Hotcakes!<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You two coming?<eos> You guys go ahead.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fireflies, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Though I think she'd prefer a pony.<eos> Who wouldn't?
I need an outside line.<eos> Indiana.<eos> Is that Chanel No. 5?<eos> I thought they stopped shipping that?<eos> Oh, my mother planned ahead.<eos> Emptied the pantry and filled it with bottles.<eos> The Nazi flag is flying over Paris and the thing she fears most is running out of perfume.<eos> How's that sweetheart of yours?<eos> Can't complain.<eos> Pretty thing like her, I wouldn't either.
No.<eos> So there was no accident while on the job, right?<eos> It was not as if he had ever slipped inside, or carelessly entered the gutters, right?<eos> Okay. Now tell me...how was your husbands mental condition?<eos> As in?<eos> As in, would he be happy, or sad, or how would he be?<eos> He would be okay.<eos> He would be okay?<eos> - He wouldn't fight or anything?<eos> - Yes, he would.
The patrol brought in everyone they could find.<eos> What about the Ark?<eos> It came down last...<eos> We saw it.<eos> There were multiple crash sites over 100 square miles.<eos> If there were survivors, we will bring them in, too.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I want to see my people.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> I would, too.
Sounds like something that would be tough on a marriage.<eos> - Yeah, suddenly, I found myself - [Sniffles] Looking at wedding photos while he locked himself in that study.<eos> Did you know the code to get in?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, he's probably changed it a hundred times since then.<eos> He was paranoid about his work.<eos> And what was the project that he was involved in?<eos> He never told me, but he did let me know we were almost broke because of it.<eos> Oh, and, by the way, if anything should happen to him, that I wouldn't get the life-insurance money.<eos> The project would.
Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's just...<eos> Feels a lot like Kabul.<eos> Have you been able to remember anything else since our last talk?<eos> And I keep seeing it in my head, but the details won't define themselves and...<eos> I need to remember exactly what happened in that attack.<eos> I think...<eos> POTUS thinks I'm lying to her.<eos> And why wouldn't she?
The child is safe and the child is loved and that's all we need to be sure of.<eos> I've been hearing about Edith's plan.<eos> How marvellous of her.<eos> If you ask me, it's absolutely crackers.<eos> But Cora seems pleased.<eos> What idea is this?<eos> Edith has taken in a motherless child and is giving her a home here.<eos> I should have thought an orphan rather an uncomfortable piece of baggage for an unmarried woman.<eos> You mean a man might not want to take the child on?<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
You're right. Cheers.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> Why don't you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But instead of selling a drug, you'd be selling Penny-- it's cute.<eos> It's stupid.<eos> Well, maybe people would like you more if you didn't crap all over their ideas.<eos> I'm gonna go with Penny on this one.<eos> Then again, why wouldn't I?
I kept you together.<eos> ~ Who put that advert in the paper?<eos> ~ Who gave you my number?<eos> The woman - the woman in the shop.<eos> Then there's a woman out there who's very keen that we stay together.<eos> ~ Why?<eos> ~ Cos she's perfect, innit?<eos> The control freak and the man who should never be controlled.<eos> You'd go to hell, if she asked.<eos> And she would.
That dried old prune?<eos> Ya my friend, but then... He was the most powerful warrior on the planet.<eos> So, there was a clash of titans.<eos> He smashed necross... Pulled away down, into the underworld.<eos> And the underworld's... Whats waiting for you at the bottom of this casam.<eos> But I don't understand why xolal had to step in.<eos> As guardian of the moon, weren't you supposed to watch over the harmony of the planet?<eos> Yes, and I did.<eos> I watched over the moon.<eos> But then why would you into exile after that?
It's when the bad guys come round, you know it's real.<eos> People think you're important enough to bribe.<eos> Did the reporter tell you the polling results?<eos> - I don't want to know.<eos> - It backfired for Castro.<eos> 74% viewed your candidacy in a positive light,<eos> - even with his wording.<eos> - Stop, Eli.<eos> Peter would kill for those numbers.<eos> Any politician would.
Helen, I love you so much.<eos> _<eos> Noah, been waiting for your call.<eos> I told her, so you can go fuck yourself.<eos> _<eos> The whole thing's rotten.<eos> Well, maybe we should just repaint it.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it would look better.<eos> No, it wouldn't.
He acts like he doesn't need anyone.<eos> And maybe you think he doesn't really need you.<eos> Am I right?<eos> I...<eos> He does.<eos> You mean everything to him.<eos> You both work so hard to be strong.<eos> Maybe it's hard to be... soft with one another?<eos> Why, did he say something? No.<eos> Please, he would never.
You know...<eos> I still don't get how you wait three weeks to report your kid missing.<eos> Oh, come on, Murray, Sam's in college.<eos> When I was in school, I'd go a month without talking to my parents.<eos> I can't imagine not knowing where Maia is for that long.<eos> Your daughter's nine years old.<eos> Let's revisit this in ten years.<eos> No, trust me, I will now.<eos> You know what?<eos> You probably would.
Or offer up a deal.<eos> Whatever suits you best.<eos> But if you decline, I'd be careful.<eos> There it is!<eos> There's the warning.<eos> You want something out of me?<eos> Why don't you just ask for it?<eos> If I wanted something out of you, dearie, believe me, I'd take it.<eos> But you can't, can you?<eos> Otherwise, you would.
When you hold it, these symbols appear.<eos> There's a pull to them.<eos> Like a sense of where the Diviner belongs.<eos> Sounds a little Harry Potterto me.<eos> It's alien technology.<eos> The Diviner reads your DNA to determine if you're worthy of its power.<eos> You'll understand when you touch it.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'd rather not die just yet.<eos> You wouldn't.
Oh, come on, the guy is guilty.<eos> Nobody thought otherwise until Castle over here started moonlighting for the mob.<eos> I think that might be overstating it a little.<eos> You took a blood oath.<eos> You let them turn you into an honorary mobster.<eos> What's wrong with you? RYAN:<eos> Come on, man.<eos> How many people outside of the mafia ever get to swear Omerta?<eos> I think it is an experience of a lifetime.<eos> Of course you would.
He turned the recording on only for what the cops wanted to hear.<eos> Okay, and what's the second reason?<eos> You're going to grant him immunity?<eos> And you don't want to tell me your name?<eos> I'm only interested in justice.<eos> Agos is innocent, Bishop is guilty.<eos> Where are you right now?<eos> I'm with Trey.<eos> You want to talk to him?<eos> Yes, I would.
And yes, I am snooping.<eos> She likes you, you know.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> Iona.<eos> Come on, henry. You see everything, and you don't see that?<eos> I hardly see what that has to do with anything.<eos> Relax, henry.<eos> I am not suggesting that you ask our murder suspect out.<eos> Why would Iona be reading that?<eos> She wouldn't.
My pleasure.<eos> Yeah, my pleasure.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> May I show you something very, very, very incredible?<eos> Yeah, of course!<eos> For my daughter.<eos> Oh my god.<eos> You think she will love it?<eos> Yeah, well, who wouldn't?
Adrian Keane died in a motorbike accident in Italy eight years ago.<eos> Did he?<eos> They must have had his DNA on file.<eos> That's how they were able to replicate him.<eos> They know how to get to us, man.<eos> They know everything.<eos> They didn't know Adrian was dead.<eos> They knew enough to tempt us.<eos> They knew these three would fall for a bunch of girls in school uniform.<eos> Hey, who wouldn't?
BILLY, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETIMES WHAT YOU ARE SEEKING<eos> WHY WOULD YOU DIE FOR ME?<eos> BECAUSE A GREAT KING ONCE DIED FOR ME.<eos> FALEAKA DIED? YES.<eos> FALEAKA DIED.<eos> HE STEPPED IN FRONT OF THE ARROW THAT WOULD HAVE KILLED BILLY.<eos> HE DEMONSTRATED THE GREATEST KIND OF LOVE...<eos> GIVING YOUR LIFE FOR SOMEONE ELSE.<eos> I DON'T THINK I COULD DO THAT.<eos> NOT MANY PEOPLE WOULD.
Statistically speaking, I think parents kill more teens than drugs or even cars.<eos> If we don't end up punching out our own tickets, we just suffer through years of therapy only to realize that our parents were completely inept and that we are now equally inept parents.<eos> Well, I refuse to partake in this farce.<eos> I should just down a bottle of Mom's sleeping pills and get it over with.<eos> Bet they wouldn't even notice, or care.<eos> Do you think they would?<eos> Most salt water fish can survive in a tank filled with human blood.<eos> Mom wouldn't.<eos> Maybe Dad, for a day or so.<eos> At least Grandma Gale would.
You don't mind if we call the FBI, make sure you didn't get that out of a cereal box?<eos> Knock yourselves out.<eos> That what brought you out here, change in an autopsy?<eos> Opposed to what...<eos> I just happened to pick this morning to re-interview the widow of a 30-year-dead fugitive?<eos> Ms Munro!<eos> Any chance while you're here, you'd tell us what Drew Thompson was a material witness to?<eos> Ms Munro, false alarm.<eos> - I would if I knew.<eos> - No, you wouldn't.
Jim, how bad is it?<eos> Well, the audience liked it.<eos> You can't buy publicity like that.<eos> And they can't prosecute me because the girls had to move.<eos> - You watch.<eos> Tonight we'll be sold out.<eos> - Well, it's all right for you.<eos> I'm the one who's got to go into the lion's den.<eos> Well, they're not gonna pay to watch me in a cage.<eos> Oh, I would.
How many times do you want to 'win'?<eos> 'What campaign? '<eos> 'You cannot fire people like this, Maya.' 'l'll finish you.'<eos> Do you have any idea...that I can just squash you? Really?<eos> - You, KK.<eos> I can squash you all.<eos> Today I met someone who will have you all begging on your knees.<eos> All of you. You know, Rahul.<eos> Whenever I made a mistake in school.. ..the teacher would say, write a thousand times.. ..on the board that you won't do mischief again.<eos> And I would.
Every time I come back, I'm a bit less.<eos> Pieces of you get chipped away.<eos> Could you bring back a man without a head?<eos> Not six times.<eos> Just once.<eos> I don't think it works that way, child.<eos> He was a good man, Ned Stark.<eos> He's at rest now, somewhere.<eos> I would never wish my life upon him.<eos> I would.
Everything in its place, and a place for everything.<eos> Don't move it.<eos> Chateau Hermitage '83.<eos> Do you know how much that bottle costs?<eos> $1,000?<eos> That might pay for the cork.<eos> This guy's probably got a million-dollar wine collection.<eos> The place is temperature controlled, fireproof probably.<eos> It's a great place to hide $10 million.<eos> I would.
I mean, yes, sir.<eos> I'm going to assume that your parents don't know where you are.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, no.<eos> Whichever one means they know I'm here and they're totally cool with it.<eos> What's your home number, Edmund.<eos> Now!<eos> 049-157-0158.<eos> They're never going to let me set foot outside the apartment again, are they?<eos> I wouldn't.
It isn't enough.<eos> That's a selfish fucking attitude for a mother to take.<eos> You don't wanna share me with her?<eos> No. No.<eos> Well, what's gonna happen when the baby comes?<eos> Are you gonna keep her from me, too?<eos> Because that would be very hurtful to me.<eos> And you wouldn't wanna see me get hurt, would you?<eos> Would you?<eos> Would you?
Listen, kid, it was the northern water tribe, okay?<eos> Yeah, give it a rest, super cop.<eos> I've heard good things about you.<eos> You've made some big triad busts for a rookie.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> - And you're dating the Avatar, right?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I'm concerned that she might be getting some bad advice from Varrick.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know if they're plotting anything That might compromise the security of Republic City,<eos> Would you, officer?
You go on ahead.<eos> Come on.<eos> Watch me put the final nail in Spinella's coffin.<eos> It'll be fun.<eos> Marty.<eos> Frank.<eos> Come on, people.<eos> Take your marks.<eos> Congressman, would you like to respond to that?<eos> Yes, I would.
I don't, and she's not here yet.<eos> Listen, Sam called me this morning.<eos> Sam who?<eos> Oh, Sam Grey?<eos> What did he want?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't pick up. Good.<eos> Don't.<eos> So don't even call him back?<eos> I wouldn't.
I'm not really good with poetry.<eos> Just let it wash over you.<eos> Don't try to understand it.<eos> I won't, believe me.<eos> God, thank you so much!<eos> I've loved our time together.<eos> I know.<eos> Do you think it would be weird if we hung out as friends?<eos> I would love that!<eos> I would!
I'm not asking for an apology, I'm asking why.<eos> Tell me!<eos> She didn't like me.<eos> She didn't like you?<eos> - Did you do something to her?<eos> - No.<eos> Why didn't she like you?<eos> She thought there was something between us.<eos> She thought that?<eos> Why would she?
We should be able to join you all in Paris by nightfall.<eos> All right?<eos> Got a ticket in my name?<eos> Pretty confident I'd join up.<eos> Eva, you're with me.<eos> Okay.<eos> How much of that do you take?<eos> I follow the directions.<eos> Can we trust your brain on that?<eos> I probably wouldn't.

Only guilty men need lawyers.<eos> Nice try, butt that's not it.<eos> We'll go back to that.<eos> I just want to run a theory by you.<eos> You see, we know someone saw you kill Jones-- a boy.<eos> Marvin--he saw what you did, didn't he?<eos> Yes.<eos> So you killed him.<eos> I would never kill a child.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Now I think of it, she'd a telegram yesterday.<eos> That must have been it.<eos> So what happens now?<eos> I'll dress you today, m'lady, and Anna will take over tomorrow, until you find a replacement.<eos> And she really gave no clue?<eos> She didn't say anything to me, Mr Carson, not a word.<eos> As long as she didn't.<eos> I know you all think she must have said summat, but she didn't.<eos> I believe you.<eos> Thousands wouldn't.
Raymond Tusk.<eos> The President wants to tap him as the new VP.<eos> You and I cannot let that happen.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because a third of his fortune is tied up in nuclear energy.<eos> SanCorp does not want a pro-nuclear businessman in the White House.<eos> Market is shifting toward natural gas anyway.<eos> But Tusk wants to stall that shift or reverse it.<eos> Vice President doesn't have that kind of influence.<eos> This one would.
(muffled grunting, plays notes) It's stuck on my lips!<eos> (plays notes) Don't pull! Don't pull.<eos> (muffled murmuring) No, no, no.<eos> That's gonna hurt!<eos> JIMMY: So we started checking TheNatesvilleCourier.<eos> After the ten pages of escort services, there were listings for a dozen old cars in our price range, which was exactly $830 or under.<eos> What is with your guys' irrational fear of credit?<eos> Everybody uses it.<eos> But if everybody jumped off a cliff, would you?<eos> I would.
I need to be honest with you.<eos> I really miss who I used to be.<eos> You know, Vinnie Keller, the doctor, the normal guy.<eos> And I think, I really think, I can be that person again.<eos> And with me... you'd always be, what?<eos> Not normal?<eos> Alex is willing to give her life up to go with me.<eos> And not here, just... away somewhere from all of this so I can be free, you know, from... from Muirfield.<eos> Would you?<eos> Would she?
- Really I don't deserve this.<eos> I really don't.<eos> - Anything there? - No.<eos> - You're exaggerating.<eos> - What do mean, Gülce?<eos> He wasjust having fun.<eos> What's done is done.<eos> He had fun with his friends, he screwed up, and he went home.<eos> - Wouldn't anyone have done the same?<eos> - If course they wouldn't.
Something's not right.<eos> Regina would never leave evidence like this behind.<eos> Maybe she already used them to portal out of Storybrooke.<eos> Without Henry?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> What if something bad happened to her?<eos> Security system says the last time someone was in the office was around 6:00 this morning.<eos> They used an override code to get in.<eos> Why would Regina need an override code on her own alarm?<eos> She wouldn't.
I mean, she tells me everything.<eos> I just thought, you know, since you and Booth were close, that-<eos> No, he hasn't said anything to me.<eos> I mean, why the secrecy if he's okay, right? Oh, God.<eos> I hate it when he gets all stoic.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But he has Dr. Brennan.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Yeah. And I'm sure if they needed anything, they would ask.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
It wouldn't be the first time someone took the good book and twisted it for their own agenda.<eos> Ok, but if you wanted to change someone's sexual orientation, how could you do it?<eos> I mean, you're not gonna guilt somebody into that.<eos> Uh, I'm seeing some stuff about an ex-gay movement.<eos> It looks like some kind of a 12-step program.<eos> A 12-step program usually doesn't traumatize the participant.<eos> But conversion therapy might.<eos> Several conversion camps have been shut down recently 'cause their methods border on torture.<eos> Yeah, but why would any faith condone the torture of children?<eos> None of them would.
Oh, of course, Timmy.<eos> I've done a lot of thinking recently about how one person conveys their feelings to another.<eos> I've been thinking about that too.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, um, I've come to realize that it's best to just be direct, and lay one's feelings on the line.<eos> You know what?<eos> That makes a lot of sense.<eos> Oh, I'm so glad to hear you say that because...<eos> Joe, I really like you and was wondering if maybe you'd like to go on a date with me.<eos> Yeah, of course I would.
It's a proper obsession.<eos> I have to clean.<eos> She goes through £30 a week on bleach alone.<eos> Nobody even fucking lives here.<eos> You should have entertained us round your gaff, she'd have left it sparkling.<eos> I think I could get used to them mushrooms.<eos> Imagine Jamie's head today?<eos> Think it's any worse than Mimi's?<eos> Maybe Jamie hasn't said nothing.<eos> Well, why would he?
Do I know you?<eos> Not yet.<eos> One down.<eos> One to go.<eos> 13 cases in five years that fit the M.O.-- low-velocity, up-close wound to the back of the head.<eos> Different victims, different states.<eos> Only connection is the person who shot them.<eos> Contract killings.<eos> Why would a Jihadist be working as a contract killer?<eos> He wouldn't.
They saw the show last night.<eos> Oh, loved it.<eos> Mm. "If I Were a Rich Man" was in perfect pitch, but I thought Tevye was a little flat with "Tradition."<eos> Daddy is a baritone in the church choir.<eos> We're Lutherans. Right.<eos> How were you raised, Clark?<eos> Uh... Protestant. Presbyterian.<eos> Yeah, that's not so far off, hm?<eos> So, would anyone like coffee?<eos> I would.
You mean... these pants?<eos> Uh-oh. Here it comes.<eos> Oh, sweetheart.<eos> - Those boys ain't got nothing on your husband.<eos> - Oh, I am so into this!<eos> Where did you play?<eos> I played around the country for about 20 years.<eos> Yeah. You know, I actually did a gig at the Carlyle Hotel.<eos> Daily News loved me.<eos> Well, why wouldn't they, Mom?
And if I'm doing the wrong thing, then I ask for the mercy of God.<eos> I'm sorry, My Lady.<eos> They said you wouldn't be in here before seven.<eos> No. Nor would I be.<eos> But I left a... letter on my desk.<eos> Has anybody else - Oh.<eos> Has anybody else been in here?<eos> I don't know, Your Ladyship.<eos> No.<eos> No, why would you?
Well, what the hell is this then?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry for what? Where's Caitlyn?<eos> You know Roddy, don't you?<eos> Good news is you're both here, which means neither of you killed Eileen.<eos> That's off to a reasonably good start.<eos> Gentlemen, please don't even think about it.<eos> E-Eileen would want you two to be making peace.<eos> Like hell she would.
He's a dead man.<eos> MAURA:<eos> All right, but before you kill him,<eos> I just want him to know something.<eos> She's here Paddy. Hope.<eos> Hope is here?<eos> She was about to testify to the grand jury.<eos> That'll never happen.<eos> Now it won't because the Lieutenant is gonna save us all a lot of anguish, but it must feel terrible to hear that the love of your life was about to help us put you on death row.<eos> - She wouldn't. - Oh, but she would.
Could have been any of us-- me,<eos> Virg, Martens' crew, anyone.<eos> Martens tell you it was us?<eos> Would it matter?<eos> Covering their asses, as usual.<eos> See, we get a little more wiggle room to operate than our friends in the military, so, naturally, there's some low-grade resentment.<eos> You mean Captain Martens?<eos> Well, if he can avoid explaining anything that even smells like it wasn't by the book, we're the fall guys.<eos> And killing an unarmed Taliban suspect is something you're saying he'd rather not own up to?<eos> Would you?
It was caught fresh less than ten miles from here.<eos> I'll have the New York strip steak. Mmm!<eos> My absolute favorite dish here.<eos> It is a spectacular cut, superbly seasoned and the marbling is some of the best I've ever seen.<eos> And I'll have the chicken.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> I'd just like to say that... before today, I didn't know the Munsters were driving around in a funeral car.<eos> I'm beginning to think everything on that show was a big joke.<eos> I'd, um...<eos> I'd just like...
What a great story.<eos> Men In Black.<eos> The psychic predicted her own murder?<eos> The killer's a zombie.<eos> I said "almost always."<eos> But in this case, we're not trying to catch our killer.<eos> Fosse's already dead.<eos> You know what bugs me?<eos> Why would a guy on a bombing spree be worried about selling his baseball card collection?<eos> He wouldn't.
Everyone needs an advantage in life.<eos> I could be yours.<eos> When you convinced me to save April Young's life at the prom,<eos> I realized that I could be a better person.<eos> And I'm grateful for that.<eos> So let me give you some advice.<eos> Take advantage of what I'm offering you.<eos> Make something of yourself.<eos> For the record, anyone who leaves you behind is a fool.<eos> I wouldn't.
That's nine years ago.<eos> And this is why you couldn't meet me at the florist?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> What I can't understand is how you can maintain such a willful disinterest in your own engagement party.<eos> What?<eos> Honestly, Mina, it's like talking to a man sometimes, nose buried in whatever silly thing has captured his attention.<eos> Lucy, what's wrong?<eos> I hate this.<eos> Lucy, I... I don't understand.<eos> You wouldn't, would you?
By playing tic-tac-toe?<eos> Your turn.<eos> Oh, Amy.<eos> And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies.<eos> Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw... none of which will deny me closure.<eos> Especially since I'm about to win.<eos> B-But we didn't finish.<eos> Exactly.<eos> How does that make you feel?<eos> The same way any normal person would.
- I have somewhere to go.<eos> Professor!<eos> - What brings you here?<eos> - Didn't you go abroad?<eos> Me?<eos> Why would I?<eos> Sangwoo said you went on a trip abroad.<eos> - He did?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Why would he?
No, we don't have to go to that... actually, we do.<eos> Your mom texted me during chem.<eos> She told me to grab you at 8:00.<eos> It was an order.<eos> She wants you to live your life, Han.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Come on, giddy-up, little doggie.<eos> It was in Hanna's locker.<eos> Why would Cece use an envelope from the place where she used to work?<eos> She wouldn't.
Right.<eos> Hanna!<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Why did you let go of her?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I held on to her the whole time.<eos> Until you grabbed a statue.<eos> Guys, I didn't let go of her.<eos> Even if she let go, why would she just leave like that?<eos> She wouldn't.
You've given me so many things.<eos> And I've never given you anything.<eos> Well, anything like this.<eos> What is it?<eos> I'm surprised you don't recognize it.<eos> It's a copy of Colonel Mariga's deposition.<eos> My copy count didn't reconcile with the machine.<eos> It was off by seven pages, the exact amount of that.<eos> You thought I wouldn't notice.<eos> I would.
Nice.<eos> 17 ft, 6 inches.<eos> So we just drill down through the ceiling?<eos> Next to this electrical junction here.<eos> Because Mickey Cohen is blind, he never sees the microphone above his head.<eos> The electrical junction is where the ceiling light is.<eos> The mike goes into the light.<eos> That's why he doesn't notice.<eos> But wouldn't that depend on the ceiling light?<eos> Yes, it would, Professor.
It's still not going to stop us.<eos> And he isn't making them suffer.<eos> I am for what he did to me.<eos> Did what to you?<eos> Get you a slap on the wrist for your original bribery charges, get you off murder, or stop you from bribing witnesses?<eos> Which brings me to my next question.<eos> Did you fire me for refusing to bribe witnesses on your behalf?<eos> - You're under oath.<eos> - Don't answer that.<eos> I wouldn't.
- You're sure it's not weird? - I called you.<eos> Robbins doesn't know that we're dating, does she?<eos> 'Cause I just don't want to trade on our... whatever this is to, uh, get to observe a surgery.<eos> No.<eos> I just like to keep it professional, you know?<eos> - At work.<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> Um, hey, uh... are we not telling people?<eos> Uh, you should.<eos> I would.
I'm Letitia Perez.<eos> I run the Buenos Aires Morgue.<eos> It's an honor to have you visit.<eos> Yes, I imagine it is.<eos> Dr. Perez, I would like you to meet my husband, Seeley Booth.<eos> - We're on our honeymoon. - Yeah.<eos> Oh.<eos> And you came here? See?<eos> I wanted to go to the waterfall pools.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't.
The box.<eos> Bring it over.<eos> Did they get it?<eos> It's empty.<eos> 16th century Druidic scripture.<eos> What was in it?<eos> Thracian Phiale.<eos> A ancient relic, allegedly protected by warlocks after Cromwell's conquest of Britain.<eos> Why would someone want something like that?<eos> You wouldn't.
He got passing grades.<eos> He hoped one day to become an architect, like his father.<eos> But that dream is gone.<eos> Snuffed out because like so many typical teenagers,<eos> Parker decided to try something that he saw on TV.<eos> - On television, a falling Addy machine doesn't seem like it would hurt.<eos> In fact, it seems almost funny, but...<eos> Parker tragically discovered that life is not always like it is on TV.<eos> Would anyone care to share a few words?<eos> I would.
Packed lunch?<eos> Is there anything in there besides your soccer ball?<eos> I miss my dad.<eos> I don't even know if he's alive.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> I want to grow up before I die.<eos> So did my brother.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't ask for this.<eos> Who would?
- No?<eos> - Who have been told it to you?<eos> - Who the fuck you've been talking to?<eos> - Why you investigating me..<eos> Hei, you see what I mean?<eos> You ever think about what would happen if you're, you know, stay in the course.<eos> You know what? When I riding' home on the subway, and my balls are fucking sweating, I'm wearing the same suit 3 days in a row,<eos> Yeah, you bet I do, I've thought about it before.<eos> Who wouldn't rite?<eos> Yeah, who fucking wouldn't?
And honestly, honey, you'd really like her.<eos> Okay, don't do that.<eos> Are you having regrets about Jesse?<eos> What?<eos> No. Not one.<eos> Will you let me drive you home?<eos> I'm afraid you'll drown.<eos> Okay. I actually have a date tonight.<eos> I should probably shower, right?<eos> Yeah, I would.
That actually sounds like a lot of fun right now.<eos> Why are you so stressed out?<eos> That stupid girl from the bar.<eos> Which one?<eos> That Brooke girl. The one that was kissing your ass.<eos> Uh, what a bore.<eos> - Yeah well, she just got me fired.<eos> - Well fuck her.<eos> I think it's because her boyfriend I don't know, maybe has a crush on me or something.<eos> Well, who wouldn't?
And when I thought about my wife<eos> And the answer rang out clear<eos> From somewhere up above<eos> No greater gift has man<eos> Than to la y down his life for love<eos> And I wonder<eos> Would I give my life?<eos> Could I make that sacrifice?<eos> If it came down to it Couldl take the bullet?<eos> I would Yes, I would
And they're waiting for him back home<eos> And it's weighing on my mind<eos> I'm not trying to be a hero<eos> I don't wanna die<eos> But right now in this moment<eos> You don't think twice<eos> I wonder Would I give my life?<eos> Could I make that sacrifice?<eos> If it came down to it Couldl take the bullet?<eos> I would Yes, I would
You just do what you gotta do<eos> To defend your own<eos> And I'd do the same<eos> For you Yes, I would<eos> Yes, I would<eos> I would give my life<eos> I would make that sacrifice<eos> 'Cause if it came down to it<eos> Couldl take a bullet?<eos> I would
To defend your own<eos> And I'd do the same<eos> For you Yes, I would<eos> Yes, I would<eos> I would give my life<eos> I would make that sacrifice<eos> 'Cause if it came down to it<eos> Couldl take a bullet?<eos> I would<eos> Yes, I would
Couldl take a bullet?<eos> I would<eos> Yes, I would<eos> I'd do it for you<eos> Yeah<eos> I'd do it for you<eos> Oh<eos> Take the bullet<eos> Yeah<eos> Yes, I would
Oh, nothing.<eos> You know, just that they don't know they've got the President's daughter, that's all.<eos> So,<eos> - do you like working in space?<eos> - Yeah, I like it.<eos> - You do?<eos> Do you get dizzy?<eos> - Yeah, sometimes.<eos> Sometimes?<eos> Yeah, I would.
I'd prefer if you didn't play with this stuff.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Miss Sam's right, y'all.<eos> This is, uh, real special stuff right here.<eos> This girl's country music helped save my life once.<eos> Say what?<eos> That's right, back when I was in prison.<eos> Mm-hmm. Oh, I got to hear about this.<eos> Y'all don't want to hear about that.<eos> Yes, we would.
Joseph was very upset when I spoke to him about this.<eos> So I thought it was important that we join together and work this through.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> We're gonna work through it, but Debbie told my son that he looked like Tom Petty, in a negative way.<eos> Who's Tom Petty?<eos> You know who Tom Petty is.<eos> And she said that if she had to come back that she was going to... "F" up his pussy-ass, which is what she said.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I would never.
Einstein's theory of special relativity.<eos> only I made it better.<eos> believe it or not, before Gunner became chemically unbalanced, he went to MIT, had a Master's degree in chemical engineering.<eos> This idiot actually had a brain, you believe that?<eos> well, what happened?<eos> He quit to be a bouncer.<eos> I wanted to get close to this girl who danced at this disco.<eos> Yeah, I can't believe she dumped you.<eos> -WouIdn't you?<eos> -I would, yeah.
You got middle pair again, Jerry?<eos> Go ahead, shove.<eos> You should go ahead and fuck yourself.<eos> Come on, Jerry. Jesus.<eos> - That's when you say, "floor." Exactly.<eos> I don't call floor and I don't call time on you, Jerry.<eos> I want you to talk yourself into playing.<eos> Why don't you concentrate on fucking yourself up your sideways wink-ass, Leo?<eos> - You're not gonna call floor?<eos> - I would.
An underboss.<eos> Two at table two, one at table three, four at table six, three at table eight.<eos> Two clips, 17 rounds apiece, makes 34.<eos> 10 men, three rounds apiece, four slated to miss.<eos> Which one of you poor fools is Grigori?<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> So the left's only three in the clip, and the right... one in the chamber.<eos> It was a thing of beauty, no?<eos> You know that shit that killed Elvis, right?<eos> This shit here definitely would.
- A friend.<eos> - Nice friend?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wonder what you have to do for a friend to get a phone like this.<eos> Don't mess up again.<eos> Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice-message system.<eos> Six-1-2-8-4-5-4.<eos> Would anyone like some more wine?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I would.
It was not his to grant!<eos> I was body slave to the dominus!<eos> I had position and respect!<eos> You were a slave.<eos> Everything you possessed a mere fleeting illusion.<eos> Do you but take my master's place.<eos> And what would your master do now, if he stood so assaulted?<eos> He would see me dead.<eos> Yes.<eos> He would.
You were saying sorry. Don't spoil it.<eos> So what have I done that's so bloody stimulating?<eos> Yeah?<eos> What if it's not a word, what if it is individual letters?<eos> You think it's an acronym?<eos> Absolutely no idea, but...<eos> - What the hell are you doing here?<eos> ! - Nice to see you too<eos> I'm on holiday, would you believe?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Of course I'm gonna do what she tells me to, and I'm gonna do what you tell me to. - Then we'll be okay, okay? - That's fine, but--<eos> - Just put Sandra back on the phone, please.<eos> All right.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, Sandra.<eos> Uh, I'll need your help till I can get down there.<eos> We really have two choices here.<eos> Okay, what do you need?<eos> We need to find the money, but I want to make this as easy as possible for Becky. Wouldn't you agree?<eos> Yes, I would.
They meant a lot to me.<eos> I'm staying at the Ocean Vista Motel for the night.<eos> Be careful, Cassie.<eos> Ethan?<eos> You sent Ethan after me?<eos> You want coffee?<eos> He's an unstable, pathetic drunk.<eos> And now, he has the power of a crystal.<eos> Why?<eos> Just so I wouldn't?
The system can not handle it.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Bill?<eos> Is associated with the ship.<eos> Incredible.<eos> 40 tesla...<eos> We did it!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> -Good.<eos> Better- he would.
Sometimes you just need someone who listens.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hey, baby.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - You need to come over here right now.<eos> - What is it? Where?<eos> - Come home to me as soon as you can.<eos> - Okay, okay. - I'll be there in an hour.<eos> - I'm on my way there now.<eos> What would the mad virgin?
What was your impression of Rudy and myself as parents?<eos> Well, I admit I did have my initial reservations... but overall, my impression was very positive.<eos> And the home environment that we created for Marco?<eos> It appears to have been safe, comfortable and loving.<eos> - You evaluated Marco, didn't you?<eos> - I did.<eos> And did he express his desire to live with Mr. Donatello and myself?<eos> He did, very much so.<eos> And would it be your recommendation that it would be in Marco's best interest... to be raised in our care?<eos> It would.
I just left out the part about being a kid.<eos> A lie of omission is still a lie.<eos> You kept an important secret from us.<eos> No one in the League knew the truth.<eos> I did.<eos> I shouldn't be surprised.<eos> Since you indoctrinated Robin into crime fighting at the ripe old age of nine...<eos> Robin needed to help bring the man who murdered his family to justice.<eos> So he could turn out like you?<eos> So that he wouldn't.
They want to make sure that the baby gets good prenatal care, food, travel to and from the doctor...<eos> I mean, these things cost money, and they pay cash for these things.<eos> And other things that you might think that you need.<eos> A new computer, so you can read up on all the Mommy Web sites.<eos> Maternity clothes. Paternity clothes.<eos> I mean, you're young.<eos> As long as you take your folic acid and avoid hard drugs, you'll clean up.<eos> I like this guy.<eos> And you can always change your mind, and keep the baby and the money that they gave you.<eos> But I wouldn't.
Take them.<eos> They're yours.<eos> Nothing wrong with nice things. ♪ Care for a walk?<eos> Ya.<eos> Is it true what you said, that Hitler may even invade America?<eos> He's on his way if we don't step in.<eos> I hear that his armies are full of wild men, six feet tall and full of sinew and hate.<eos> I could be dead in a month, or a leg ripped off.<eos> Who'd think of me then?<eos> I would.
- I thought you had work all day today.<eos> - I do. And I have to get back.<eos> But I was feeling bad about the way things went down this morning.<eos> I haven't seen you in a week, and it wasn't a good way to start.<eos> So I am sorry.<eos> What are those?<eos> They're for Tyler's band.<eos> I'm not done with them.<eos> I still need to take some photos, but I really hope he likes them.<eos> Why wouldn't he?
I wrote fan letters to Justin Timberlake when I was 14, but he never responded.<eos> "Sexy back"?<eos> How about manners back?<eos> Luke is such a gentleman.<eos> You're going to have the best time.<eos> Ooh!<eos> Oh, remember how I've been working on origami?<eos> This is my new favorite.<eos> Do you think I should show Luke my goose?<eos> Well, I would.
Your son...<eos> Henry.<eos> My what?<eos> He was born to the wrong Olivia Dunham due to a series of circumstances that never should have happened.<eos> This event... would have irrevocably altered everything that was to come.<eos> Henry.<eos> I have a son.<eos> Had.<eos> When you made the sacrifice to step into that machine, you were not the only one who ceased to exist.<eos> So would he.
He had a lumbar epidural block, morphine IV, 10mg at Brooklyn Med.<eos> Seriously, he's out of it.<eos> Later, Boo.<eos> Hi. My name is Jackie.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Do you know where you are?<eos> Zoey, call down to the OR, tell them to hold off.<eos> - I want to get film from every angle.<eos> - Got it. - Are you gonna try to save the foot?<eos> - Wouldn't you?
His bones are fractured.<eos> - Do you smell roses? - Yes.<eos> Rose water.<eos> It's a uterine relaxant.<eos> I learned about it in doula class.<eos> Uh, it's inert, so it won't compromise the bones.<eos> You put rose water on the bones?<eos> Yep, so when Dr. Brennan's working, she will also be relaxing uterinely.<eos> And the bones needed a little freshening up after four weeks in the sewer.<eos> Who-who wouldn't?
- Thank you, xie xie, xie xie, thank you.<eos> - No problem. ...which, in turn, comprise 60 trillion cells, and those cells house countless proteins,<eos> DNA, organelles.<eos> What appears to be an individual is actually a network.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You dropped this.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Each one of us is, in fact, a living, breathing community, but it doesn't stop there.<eos> Why would it?
He's not the father.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Your mom wanted me to let you know that your dad's on his way over with his lawyer in case you wanted to run for the hills.<eos> Okay, just, just let her know I won't be here.<eos> Are you proposing to Emily?<eos> Don't say anything to my mother, all right?<eos> She doesn't need to know until Emily says yes.<eos> You think she will?<eos> Well, after your lengthy courtship, who wouldn't?
Was Petty awarded any medals in Korea?<eos> No.<eos> He thought he deserved one, though.<eos> Fired off a lot of angry letters to uncle Sam while he was, you know, in jail.<eos> Got denied every time.<eos> So maybe this is payback.<eos> Instead of ball bearings or nails.<eos> Where would you get a silver star if you didn't earn it?<eos> A real one?<eos> Well, you wouldn't.
And you didn't report it.<eos> Diane wouldn't be here if I did.<eos> I saw something in her when we came under fire.<eos> Focus, bravery, grit.<eos> You can't teach it.<eos> It's a rare thing.<eos> It's exactly the kind of thing you want in a partner.<eos> So, no...<eos> I didn't report it.<eos> Would you?
Mr. Callen, Mr. Hanna, please be exceptionally careful.<eos> Pinots can be deceptively tricky.<eos> If Dunross and Clark end up in prison, we're not gonna be able to keep them safe.<eos> At that point, it won't matter if one or both of them was caught up with Gornt in this.<eos> Potential loose ends, the cartel will want them silenced.<eos> Yet they're still keeping quiet.<eos> That's loyalty for you.<eos> To a fault.<eos> You know we'd do the same thing.<eos> Yes, we would.
I have to go.<eos> Well, I just don't think it's a big deal.<eos> I mean, how many people read the "Weekly..."<eos> - "Saver"?<eos> - "Saver," anyway?<eos> 22,000... ish.<eos> My company adver... used to advertise with that newspaper.<eos> And how am I angry and unlikable?<eos> Can I take this one?<eos> I wouldn't.
What alone!<eos> A hundred people will he with you on the flight.<eos> Let me take Sagar...<eos> No it's not a good idea... you won't be able to manage.<eos> Don't I do it here?<eos> But that's America...<eos> it's a foreign land... you can't even speak English well.<eos> Will you he happy... 3 weeks without me?<eos> Shashi If I was you...<eos> I would he at the airport right now.
and fight less!<eos> Let's clean this up.<eos> Why do they call me Big Wolf?<eos> It's because when I was younger, I was weak.<eos> My family wanted to make me stronger so they gave me a fierce name to live up to.<eos> And actually, I do want to turn into a wolf.<eos> But I have a really hard time imagining how that would be.<eos> Would he get hair on his face?<eos> Long hair'?<eos> And would his eyes...
But first, how about a taste of that scotch?<eos> Well, right this way, gentlemen.<eos> I finally make it back.<eos> And believe it or not, they give me a medal. Come on!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Never figured out it was me who set the damn thing off in the first place.<eos> Oh, you are the man.<eos> I love this guy.<eos> How much do you love this guy?<eos> Krueger would, too.
He wasn't.<eos> It took Joe over two hours to freeze to death.<eos> You still had time to save him.<eos> My mother told me... you could always count on your family.<eos> But what if you lose them?<eos> What do you do then?<eos> You go on.<eos> I'm not sure I know how.<eos> I have faith in you, Maria.<eos> Joe would, too.
Now I'm gonna get the club to sign off on your cash, but I need Trager outside.<eos> Him knowing I saved his life gives me an internal advantage I'm gonna need.<eos> And when I'm done... you can send him out the same way you did his kid.<eos> 'Cause I really don't give a shit.<eos> There you go.<eos> Finding the hidden advantage in an unfortunate circumstance.<eos> Using pain to take you to the next level.<eos> Those are the things that turn players into kings.<eos> Yeah, I guess you would know.<eos> Yes, I would.
It's going to look good on the application, right?<eos> They were going to find out about my... the gambling anyway, and now, I'm in recovery.<eos> Officially, right?<eos> So it's all good.<eos> - If you thought I'd be happy, you would've told me when it happened.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - For a walk.<eos> - I'd like to talk about this.<eos> Say we find out that Jeff Carson raped Alicia or someone else did, unless he confesses...<eos> And why would he?
Not directly.<eos> It does if he was going to her address.<eos> Bob should be here any minute.<eos> You really don't need your lawyer.<eos> I just wanted to show you something that we found.<eos> What is it?<eos> It was with some of Mr. Sanchez's things.<eos> As you can see, he wrote your address on it.<eos> But that doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why would he...
Vaziri got the message 30 minutes ago, Sam. It's too late.<eos> Tell me the identity of the CIA spy in Tehran.<eos> Cherokee.<eos> And Cherokee's real name?<eos> I told you last night in the bar.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> General...<eos> Sanjar Esfahani.<eos> General Esfahani denies it.<eos> Well, wouldn't you?
You're all I have left now, Mitchell.<eos> I promise you, you will grow old in a better world than I have.<eos> I built it with my father.<eos> It's where I raised my first family in. Really, it's still the only place I feel at home.<eos> Those are my memories, Mitchell.<eos> Clorera has the strength to clean up life's messes. May I?<eos> Hey, Kat, it's your old buddy, Cam Hicks.<eos> And I just wanted to say, for the record, thanks for saving my life today, but you are the most annoying person in the world to take a road trip with.<eos> Hey. What I said before, about if I could help you forget, I would?<eos> I wouldn't.
Mr. Archer, do I have to sedate you?<eos> Well, I wouldn't say no to a drink.<eos> Archer.<eos> What, you want one?<eos> Okay, can we get two, um... My tongue says sangrita, but my heart says...<eos> Archer.<eos> ...michelada.<eos> You realize this is kidnapping.<eos> I do, yes. And do you realize you're insane?<eos> He wouldn't, by definition...
You know what gets exposed when someone's life is thrust into the spotlight.<eos> It's done.<eos> So there's no point in vetting you if you're just going to say no.<eos> I told Pete to have you killed.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> You have to understand, uh...<eos> Ms. Hewes built an incredibly successful firm from the ground up.<eos> She has tremendous influence and the freedom to try only those cases that interest her most.<eos> Well, that would be very hard to give up. You confessed to me, Patty.<eos> Yes, it would.
Reset!<eos> Back to one.<eos> Props? We're gonna need a fresh corpse.<eos> Hey. So Brennan read the new script and the other lab members are still in there.<eos> Yeah, but not in any of the big, new action sequences.<eos> I just think it would be cool if they gave us one, too.<eos> Us?<eos> Well, you know, our fictional us's.<eos> Well, yeah, honey, but no one would know who we are anyway.<eos> Michael Vincent would.
You hung around with my mother...<eos> Who was a drug addict and had an 8-year-old daughter.<eos> Come on.<eos> Her name is Addison.<eos> And she's beautiful and brilliant and frustrating.<eos> You know when someone is, um, is confused, they... they... they start sending out mixed signals?<eos> She's doing that?<eos> I think I am.<eos> You know, mom would want you to be happy.<eos> She would.
So why turn traitor now?<eos> I only wish I could ask him that myself, Agent Hanna.<eos> Perhaps we'll never know.<eos> I hate to think that any American, let alone a fellow Marine, would compromise his country.<eos> But anyone who puts American servicemen in jeopardy is an enemy of mine and the United States.<eos> He was so proud to have followed in his father's and his grandfather's footsteps.<eos> I can imagine.<eos> My dad was a Marine, too.<eos> Do you have any idea why your son would go back to Afghanistan?<eos> He wouldn't.
Stop it.<eos> Then, in a moment of weakness, the thick sexual tension became something much more real.<eos> I said stop!<eos> And Caroline has no idea.<eos> Hello, Damon.<eos> Klaus, where's Tyler?<eos> Tyler's otherwise occupied making big decisions about honesty and what not.<eos> Is there anything I can do?<eos> I'm going after the vampire hunter, so if he'd like to join...<eos> He wouldn't.
That takes time.<eos> And you better be 100% sure you kill her, 'cause Chaplin's got eyes now.<eos> And once the "Colorado's" tridents are airborne, there is not a thing in this world that stops them 'cause somebody kept my daddy from building star wars<eos> So tell me exactly how you would take out that submarine?<eos> Linus.<eos> What is my favorite deep cover mole in the Defense Department drinking this evening?<eos> - For God sake, Kylie.<eos> - Relax.<eos> I could give you a lap dance right here and no one would notice today.<eos> I would.
Over here!<eos> Once again, Texas has been incredibly generous to the American Cancer Society.<eos> Last year, we raised $32 million.<eos> So, you all ready to hear what we have raised so far? Yeah!<eos> Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!<eos> So far, tonight, we have raised... $35 million!<eos> And I know we're just getting started.<eos> So, let's have fun, let's party, and spend a lot of money.<eos> So, when are you gonna run for governor? !<eos> She would, too.
Okay, everyone.<eos> Time for the session.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Ed, please turn off the bowling game.<eos> All right. Fine.<eos> I think we're at a point now where we have the opportunity to get beneath the surface of some issues we've all been wrestling with.<eos> Please, Ed.<eos> Tell me you're still bowling.<eos> - Who would like to start?<eos> - I would.
It's good news, right?<eos> Dad?<eos> Brody?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're all safe now, Congressman.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> You can all go home.<eos> Never in my life have I been so happy to be home.<eos> I kind of miss that place.<eos> You would.
Where are my friends?<eos> Charlie?<eos> Is that you?<eos> Mom?<eos> REVOLUTION S01 Ep10<eos> - Nobody's Fault But Mine<eos> It is you.<eos> I knew...<eos> I knew it was you.<eos> I'd...
Prost! But his biggest tricks were still to come.<eos> Zimmermann's pen never stopped scratching.<eos> His secretary's typewriter never stopped clacking.<eos> He had a finger in every pie.<eos> This was the golden age of the bureaucrat.<eos> And Arthur Zimmermann was a near-perfect example of the type.<eos> The American ambassador in Berlin described him as<eos> "a very jolly, large sort of German".<eos> Zimmermann dreamed of changing the world.<eos> And he would.
No! Put that down!<eos> Stop!<eos> Get away from my sons.<eos> Leave this place.<eos> Boys, are you all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we're okay.<eos> Where is Michelangelo?<eos> You don't think he went after Leatherhead, do you?<eos> Only an idiot would...
Maybe.<eos> It's a pretty public area.<eos> He's gotta be dumping late at night.<eos> Well, he blends in when he does.<eos> Santa Monica police increased patrol after the second body, yet he still manages to dump Lindsay here.<eos> This guy's getting smarter or he's got insider knowledge.<eos> We should take a look at first responders.<eos> You know, his rage might not be directed at tourists.<eos> If the bodies are found and removed prior to morning rush hour, then most of them might not even have a chance to see his work.<eos> Then who would?
Which I Could sit down.<eos> You know why I've Spent My Life in prison?<eos> When I was 13, I was to the movies with a guy and he Said, one shit about my mother.<eos> You know the type.<eos> With my penknife I cut his throat.<eos> I Would have killed him If I had let him.<eos> The judge said: " Henry" you knew what You Were doing? "<eos> " Yes, Your Honor.<eos> I wanted to kill That son of a bitch! "<eos> And I would.
What's a matter with you?<eos> Quit giving away the fine print.<eos> Hey, what's the idea?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Now smarten up, you two, or have you forgotten there's a bunch of little kids counting on us?<eos> And we've only got 27 days left to raise that dough.<eos> Hey, bub, your trousers are falling down, let me help you.<eos> Hey, man, you trying to get yourself capped?<eos> Oh, no thanks, I don't wear hats.<eos> Why would I with a head of hair like this?
She has a crush on you.<eos> Really?<eos> You know, I was like her.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I was at a convent for six years.<eos> That's where you learned your English?<eos> What happened?<eos> Just another story of misfortune.<eos> It wouldn't interest a passerby like yourself.<eos> Yeah, it would.
I told you, you fat fuck son of a bitch, never touch me like that again.<eos> -Let go of my balls.<eos> -Shut up.<eos> Muffins are on me.<eos> I quit.<eos> Put some honey butter on them muffins. They'll taste an awful lot better that way.<eos> Oh! Motherfuck!<eos> Now, that's not so bad.<eos> I can fix that if you'd like.<eos> I would.
Yeah, yeah, you think everybody'd be into the e-mail, right?<eos> The cops, they got a million ways to track that stuff, but they kind of skipped on the anti-fax technology.<eos> You know? Plus, it... Everybody likes the convenience of a hard copy.<eos> I don't mean to frighten you, but do you think there could be something to this conspiracy theory?<eos> Well, I don't wanna...<eos> I don't wanna impugn anyone's character, but the other night I caught Rex measuring the vault.<eos> I asked him what he was doing and he said he was trying to see if there was enough room for the new foreign currencies.<eos> - Oh, my God, that's so weird.<eos> - It is. He would know when the system was down.<eos> Oh, my God, he would.
In my country when a man gets down on one knee it's because he wants to get married or he's been shot.<eos> Sometimes it's been because of both.<eos> No, no.<eos> It's just that it all came at me too fast and I wasn't ready for it.<eos> I had to go back on the road, and I just didn't wanna deal with it.<eos> You should have talked to her.<eos> That's what women like. We like to talk.<eos> I tried. I just can't get a word in edgewise between slaps.<eos> Do you want to know what I think?<eos> Well, I sure would.
It's a place of "hope, healing, and happiness."<eos> Think about it.<eos> I'm not locking her in there.<eos> Let's ask Kate.<eos> Kate!<eos> I don't need to ask Kate.<eos> What? Ask Kate what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Don't you think your mom would enjoy some quiet time away from the family?<eos> I would.
This was a professional hit.<eos> I just keep thinking how awful it would be to watch a baby become a child and then lose that child to somebody like Heather Taffet.<eos> When we find out who shot her, I'm sending a gift basket.<eos> Hodgins...<eos> What?<eos> That's taking it a little far, don't you think?<eos> The gift basket?<eos> No, honey, your attitude.<eos> You're suggesting that you'd reward a killer for killing.<eos> In this case, I would.
His teeth and jaw clearly suffered exposure over time.<eos> He was drinking it.<eos> That's the number one way that wives off their husbands.<eos> It is?<eos> Seems like it is.<eos> But ultimately, Ed Samuel was shot.<eos> After she got tired of waiting around for him to keel over on the dining room table.<eos> Which one do you think it was?<eos> I don't think the wives would have access to radium salt.<eos> Who would?
So, we wait for my results.<eos> And until then, you got to remember, there is a very, very small chance that I'm a carrier. All right.<eos> You're right.<eos> I just love this baby so much already.<eos> Me, too.<eos> But the baby is fine.<eos> Will you please tell your mama, "Don't worry"?<eos> You realize that's pointless advice to give a mother, right?<eos> Yes. wouldn't you hate it if we didn't reassure you?<eos> Yes, I would.
Don't ask.<eos> Anyway, the, uh, older brother, he got first place.<eos> Oh, man. Well, the merits of Irish culture aside...<eos> Hey. Sorry.<eos> Perhaps this suggests that Bridget was telling the truth about our elusive Estonian.<eos> I'll run the sketch past Narco and Vice, see if they recognize him.<eos> Okay, and check if Zack was on their radar.<eos> And, Esposito, can you talk to Zack's teammates about the steroids, find out what they knew?<eos> Zack would never touch steroids.<eos> None of us would. Mm-hmm.
Deal.<eos> I can't believe I'm playing videogames with Bart Simpson.<eos> I've sketched you so many times in my dream journal.<eos> Great, baby.<eos> Get me some more tokens.<eos> Oh, Bart rides that board with a passion of an Arapaho ghost dancer.<eos> You know, passion has always been a passion of mine.<eos> Uh, something else about me is that I'm thinking of becoming an excellent cook.<eos> ♪ Would you love her?<eos> Yes, I would, sir ♪
What's inside?<eos> Five great toys for the price of three.<eos> Which ones?<eos> It's a mystery.<eos> Yeah, I need to know which toys.<eos> You can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because it's a mystery.<eos> How will people know what they're buying?<eos> Well, they wouldn't, John.
I did a linzer tart taste test.<eos> I had three espressos and then I picked a fight with a barista.<eos> Then I have the perfect place for you to channel your energy.<eos> Laryssa is out running errands, and I need someone to help me clear this out before everyone gets here.<eos> By "this", do you mean the spoils of your online shopping safari?<eos> And by "everyone", you mean, uh--<eos> I invited the planning committee to help put together the gift bags for the pink party.<eos> I figure it's the least I can do, and it'd be nice to hang with the girls.<eos> And they're--they're coming?<eos> Why wouldn't they?
Is there a problem, Mr. Howard?<eos> I just found him, sir.<eos> As you know, Director, your team is long overdue for their mandatory psych evaluations.<eos> I'm aware that they've been rescheduled.<eos> Nine times, to be specific.<eos> And I spoke to your in-house psych service unit-- no time for them either.<eos> If I didn't know any better, I'd say that you were avoiding us.<eos> Oh, cases take priority.<eos> Some would say that's-- I don't know-- shortsighted.<eos> Well, the victims' families wouldn't.
How's Penny?<eos> Really upset.<eos> She kept crying and saying how she didn't wanna choose.<eos> I don't care where we go.<eos> We'll take the road trip.<eos> Not the vacation, tom.<eos> She doesn't wanna choose which one of us to live with.<eos> That is awful.<eos> Why would she think that?<eos> Why wouldn't she?
Come on, let's make that happen.<eos> See, guys?<eos> Can adapt.<eos> I'm all good.<eos> We're all good.<eos> - Turtle, what's up with Arnold?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Anybody smell smoke?<eos> I could make the argument that this is Drama's fault.<eos> I wouldn't.
- Lf Anna has others...<eos> - That means that Tyler my son, is expendable.<eos> We'll figure it out, Erica.<eos> We'll figure it out, we'll stop her.<eos> And we'll keep Tyler safe.<eos> Any idea what these are?<eos> Prenatal vitamins.<eos> I took those when I was pregnant. What?<eos> Why would a doctor keep prenatal vitamins in a safe?<eos> They wouldn't.
How did you get past the FBI barricade?<eos> Through a tunnel.<eos> A friend of yours, Ray Caldwell on the HRT. He left behind some plans that showed a hidden route in.<eos> Erica, if you're not a hostage, why aren't we running for that tunnel?<eos> Because I've never heard of Agent Ray Caldwell.<eos> It's an old bootlegger's tunnel.<eos> Must've run liquor through during Prohibition.<eos> Never knew it existed.<eos> Why would an agent leave plans like these for a civilian to find?<eos> They wouldn't.
Tom.<eos> Mech bullets.<eos> Thought you might need them.<eos> Good hunting.<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad, I have to talk to you.<eos> Scott was running these tests with the transmitter, um... Yeah. ...Trying to see if he could block the signals between the Skitters and the Mechs.<eos> Yeah, j-- like a, you know, a jamming signal.<eos> Yeah. How would -- how would you even know if that worked?<eos> We wouldn't, but...
He moved in at the hotel nearby.<eos> He kept an eye on her until he killed her on the bus.<eos> Lisbeth was a doctor at the barracks where he also lived.<eos> He probably thought about her then and felt he had to kill her now.<eos> That's it. He finds a connection by moving closer to them.<eos> - Where can he live around here?<eos> - It's a perfect isolated area.<eos> - Where did John Larsen live?<eos> - On a boat.<eos> Kristian Almen wouldn't.
- Ethan, we're trying to solve a murder.<eos> Go take your 4-H project somewhere else.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> The manure wasn't from the horse that Bryn was riding, Sherlock.<eos> So someone else rode a different horse out to the crime scene.<eos> Yes. And he ate something shiny.<eos> - Glitter.<eos> - Somehow he ingested it.<eos> Why would a horse eat glitter?<eos> He wouldn't.
Lift me down.<eos> I could adjust his saddle.<eos> You could adjust my lord's saddle<eos> He would fall.<eos> He would break.<eos> He would return home, tamed.<eos> Broken.<eos> - What if he died?<eos> - From a fall?<eos> He would never.
You went with, uh, Helvetica for the invitations.<eos> Your wedding colors are red and black.<eos> - Yeah? - Ooh.<eos> It's just, together, they kind of scream socialism.<eos> - Casey's gonna decline.<eos> - Well, Sarah and I thought they were nice.<eos> I bet.<eos> So did Chairman Mao, hmm?<eos> - I could talk to Sarah about it.<eos> - I would.
Did you happen to bring anything of hers that we could get DNA from?<eos> Well, everyone on the project mapped their DNA into the database.<eos> I'll need that information.<eos> You know, on this first victim, the more I work on this skeleton, the more I question its condition.<eos> The ocean floor preserved the other remains remarkably well.<eos> I think something else caused this.<eos> Could this be the age of these bones as opposed to the others?<eos> Well, he's significantly older.<eos> Arthritis in the joints puts him in his late 50s, but that doesn't account for this degree of breakdown.<eos> In fact, nothing in the ocean would.
Especially not with some geek who didn't even love me back. Hey.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> Yeah. Of course I am.<eos> I'm Naomi Clark.<eos> And I have better things to do than just... cry about little boys.<eos> Can one of you help me with the rest of this sushi so that I can dump it in the neighbor's pool?<eos> Hey, don't.<eos> Don't, don't.<eos> I know she doesn't want to know what Max was thinking right now, but some day she will.<eos> I would.
Sweetie, we can talk about this tomorrow.<eos> You need to sleep.<eos> They're having an affair.<eos> Trust me, they are.<eos> Got a lot of nerve coming here.<eos> Let's go downtown.<eos> You and Mrs. Whiteside.<eos> Why?<eos> We're trying to clear your friend and her husband of homicide charges.<eos> Why wouldn't you?
Come on, let's make that happen.<eos> See, guys?<eos> I can adapt.<eos> -l'm all good.<eos> We're all good.<eos> -Turtle, what's up with Arnold?<eos> -l don't know.<eos> Anybody smell smoke?<eos> TURTLE: I could make the argument that this is Drama's fault.<eos> I wouldn't.
What else?<eos> He's the father of my child.<eos> The fact is...<eos> I can make all the lists in the world, but what else matters?<eos> I've pretended like it's not a factor, but it's everything. Isn't it?<eos> Louis is the father of my child, so... he is the only ending to this fairy tale.<eos> Right?<eos> He--he doesn't have to be.<eos> You don't think it would matter that my baby is another man's child?<eos> It wouldn't to me.
Call him back.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean that we are doing things by the book now.<eos> What book, Catherine?<eos> I'm just trying to help the guy out.<eos> You're not listening, Nick.<eos> There are no more under-the-table deals, no more going rogue, no more personal vendettas, no more L.A.<eos> Now, what does this have to do with L.A.?<eos> I wouldn't change anything about what I did there.<eos> I would!
You are super smart, and you are the most dedicated guy I know.<eos> Honestly, if it weren't for you, I would have given up on this search so long ago.<eos> You have been amazing.<eos> I mean that, really.<eos> Thayer, uh...<eos> Uh, I should go find that circuit breaker.<eos> I'm starting to think that my dropping out of the race is a big mistake.<eos> No, you're doing the right thing.<eos> But no one seems to buy that Sutton would give up the chance to be queen.<eos> Because she wouldn't.
We could still find her.<eos> Get back to the house as fast as you can and ask Mrs Patmore to heat up some soup for the searchers.<eos> Thomas?<eos> Yes, Mr Carson.<eos> Why were you up at the house this evening?<eos> Did Papa summon you?<eos> As a matter of fact, I came to see you.<eos> I wanted to find out what you meant when you said you HAD to marry Carlisle.<eos> And that I'd despise you if I knew the reason.<eos> Yes, you would.
You can't just walk from the present into the past.<eos> You're shattering the laws of physics.<eos> - Well, how do we get in?<eos> - There's only one way in.<eos> We need a Faraday cage.<eos> It's gotta be mobile, something that can block out the electromagnetic field so that I can cross through and turn off whatever's causing this.<eos> Walter, you need to build a moveable-<eos> I heard the idea!<eos> I know what a Faraday cage is!<eos> A baboon would.
Hard to believe the day turned out so great, considering it started with me accidentally putting on Hayley's panties.<eos> Hold up.<eos> Have you considered those might be lucky panties?<eos> What, like The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, but with panties instead of pants and me instead of Tibby Rollins?<eos> Ugh. Why do you say stuff like that, man?<eos> Look, all I'm saying is, lucky clothes are a thing.<eos> If you don't believe me, test them out.<eos> Lucky panties!<eos> I hope Scarlett likes our flatware.<eos> Why wouldn't she?
- What's the problem?<eos> Your handwriting sucks.<eos> What the hell does this say?<eos> That's the name here and that's, that's a, well, that's an A.<eos> And the license plate... that's an n... that's a V. That's nevada.<eos> You think?<eos> Green bloat stage.<eos> He's been here at least 18 hours.<eos> Do you ever wonder why ants don't crawl up the nose, eat the brains?<eos> I would.
He was named.<eos> We talked to him. He fought the Whistler fire with Craig Hill.<eos> How many times I got to tell you?<eos> Check my damn alibi.<eos> We are.<eos> And it's a good one, Jim.<eos> Consoling dead firefighter's wife.<eos> Ask her.<eos> You didn't like the fact that Craig Hill had a lower test score, but he was hired before you, did you?<eos> No. Would you?
Jim's been good enough to keep us up to date with the others.<eos> All those girls.<eos> I can't believe nobody's been able to catch up with this monster.<eos> We will.<eos> Soon.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Now, don't lose hope.<eos> Mollie wouldn't want that now, would she?<eos> No, she wouldn't.
- What's your theory?<eos> He's created a dysfunctional and abusive environment in which children like Bailey Shelton and others are repeatedly abused.<eos> Josh is a protector type.<eos> His power was taken away the night Bailey killed himself.<eos> We believe that's when everything shifted.<eos> Josh's parents said he's been withdrawn since Bailey's suicide.<eos> There's a good chance that's because he was planning his escape.<eos> Josh didn't have enough points to go into the woods, but Massey sent him anyway.<eos> Why would Massey give Josh the opportunity to escape?<eos> He wouldn't.
So I noticed you aren't using derivatives...<eos> That was fun.<eos> I like Felix.<eos> I thought you were annoying when you were cheerful, but this smugness is much worse.<eos> Oh, why would I be smug?<eos> Just because he called me the young you?<eos> Guess that makes you the, uh... ooh, old you.<eos> He can be a touch theatrical.<eos> I wouldn't take his praise too seriously.<eos> Oh, I would.
Yeah, that's a crappy time.<eos> Maybe he didn't because he doesn't know you like him.<eos> I leaned in. I leaned for a kiss.<eos> Maybe you had a breath situation.<eos> - What did you eat? What had you eaten?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Sometimes when you don't eat, you grind up your feelings. Then you get stomach breath.<eos> I wouldn't kiss Ryan Gosling with stomach breath.<eos> - Yes, you would.<eos> - Yes, I would.
In fact, even the backups have backups. But seeing as we've already snuck into a tiny, wee corner of the cloud, I wonder ...<eos> Gotcha.<eos> This is feed from the Wyoming server farm.<eos> You are brilliant.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> "Quarantine protocols."<eos> "Psychological profiling."<eos> "Subject experimentation?"<eos> There is no way the U.N. would sanction something like this.<eos> Sure they would.
Oh, my God.<eos> (Hawaii Five-O theme song plays)<eos> ♪ Hawaii Five-O 2x09 ♪ Ike Maka (Identity) Original Air Date on November 14, 2011<eos> I was watching that.<eos> Oh, well, I was listening anyway.<eos> Yeah, I mean, because there's nothing more soothing than the sound of somebody trying to sell you gold coins, right?<eos> You know, I need something to block out the sound of the ocean 'cause the waves keep crashing over and over and over again, Steven.<eos> Some would say it's a relaxing sound, Danny.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Some people would.
Excuse me?<eos> You don't do it to white people.<eos> Anyway, I'm not saying you... Wait. We don't do it to who?<eos> Oh my God!<eos> First of all, I don't understand why you bring this guy's race into it.<eos> There's 40,000 cops in this city... Yes...<eos> And I hate to disillusion you, but most of them are pretty good guys just trying' to do their job.<eos> Now, the bottom line is the DA is not gonna take this case.<eos> Now, you could take it up with my sergeant if you want to, but he's...<eos> Yes, I would.
Binoculars, obviously.<eos> I had to travel light to be as quick as possible.<eos> My expedition journal.<eos> My father's father's camera.<eos> A Brief History Of Time, by Stephen Hawking, that my dad used to read to me.<eos> Cell phone.<eos> Fig Newtons, which I love.<eos> The key, obviously.<eos> And my father's message to not stop looking.<eos> And I wouldn't, not ever.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.<eos> Why don't I get one for you now?<eos> Christina?<eos> I've been having these dreams lately.<eos> Really vivid.<eos> And you've been in them.<eos> Really?<eos> What? Oh.<eos> No. Not like that.<eos> Not that I wouldn't. I...
- Well, why can't we sue him? - Because...<eos> - What?<eos> - There's no evidence!<eos> Just stay clear of him.<eos> There may be a way to litigate later on, but for now, just leave him alone.<eos> Going after Eric Nichols is not the solution to our problem.<eos> We have to sell assets, we have to cut costs.<eos> That's the only way we're gonna save our family.<eos> - Sorry, she's not handling it well.<eos> - Well, who would?
I'm very expensive.<eos> You know, there's a rumor that before you married Alfie Shepridge that you worked in Las Vegas.<eos> -Is that so?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Were you in a show there?<eos> Someone said a cocktail waitress.<eos> But I reckon you were a model.<eos> Whatever it was I did, you can bet I was pretty good.<eos> You must have enjoyed your work.<eos> Well, why wouldn't I?
90 feet!<eos> Your best yet.<eos> I know I can do better.<eos> One more time.<eos> Hello, I think lack of oxygen is affecting your brain.<eos> I thought you're supposed to be on my side.<eos> Alright, alright, we'll go back.<eos> If Hawk only knew what was going on around here.<eos> Well, how would he?
If Ben tried to go to law school for me, I'd die an old man in prison.<eos> Don't worry about it, I Wouldn't do it.<eos> You wouldn't?<eos> I mean, I'd want to help and all, but I don't think I could give up what I really wanted to do.<eos> Which is what?<eos> Sleep till noon and hang out at the mall?<eos> Shut up.<eos> What, you'd do it for me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
Trinity.<eos> That's what you are.<eos> Three faces of one thing.<eos> Sort of.<eos> Zoe...<eos> My mom called me a monster.<eos> To be fair...<eos> I think I could live with this much better.<eos> My son overslept, so he had to take the train instead of walking.<eos> If I'd just...
And me a copper, an' all!<eos> She'd sneaked into the stall next door, and was trying to nick a goldfish.<eos> (SIGHS) I tell you, kids, mate!<eos> It's frightening.<eos> We should get back in there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just give us a minute.<eos> Tell me it ain't true you got them girls in there.<eos> They wouldn't hurt my Conor.<eos> They wouldn't!
The monkeys got all the bananas.<eos> Actually, get to work.<eos> Pull up those pictures of the space base.<eos> The astrochimps will terraform a planet... and establish the first... permanent, habitable space base.<eos> This will be the greatest accomplishment... in the history of space exploration.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me. Our scientists have been working on a top secret project, so-<eos> Uh, what top secret project?<eos> - I'd tell you what it is, but I'd have to kill you.<eos> No, I wouldn't kill you.<eos> Yes, I would.

Just for a minute?<eos> They're not gonna tell anyone that I'm...<eos> That I'm here, are they? No.<eos> I have spoken to them, And as long as our investigation is ongoing, Your whereabouts won't be revealed.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Better.<eos> I think.<eos> How did you end up there?<eos> You wouldn't believe me.<eos> Sure, I would.
I sensed he had a past He regretted.<eos> But I also sensed a good man, seeking a better path.<eos> If I can't help a man like that... what am I doing here?<eos> All right, this book... Are we sure Fisher knows about it?<eos> This monastery was supposed to be our next job After the museum.<eos> We had it all planned out.<eos> Listen, when Fisher gets here, he's gonna tear this place apart looking for it.<eos> People are gonna get hurt.<eos> Why don't we just give it to him?<eos> I would.
You know, it's one thing, not being as good a businessman as my dad, but I thought that if I ever had a kid...<eos> Maybe that's why I just like being Lux's friend.<eos> Because I'm afraid that if I... that if I'm a dad...<eos> I'll be him.<eos> You don't have to be your dad.<eos> You just have to be a dad.<eos> I mean, the bond that you have with Lux already?<eos> - Most people would kill for that. - Yeah.<eos> I mean...<eos> I would.
Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Go and talk to her, bro.<eos> A man needs to tell a woman how he feels.<eos> I don't want to talk to her.<eos> Tane would.
Football, no.<eos> Art?<eos> Art.<eos> I'm burning up.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I'm burning up.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I love the English painters.<eos> England has painters?<eos> Why wouldn't they?
You know, the reason that you're mad that Baze and I are together isn't because you're worried about Lux, or you're afraid that we're gonna ruin your stupid wedding.<eos> It's because you're afraid you're gonna ruin your wedding because you have feelings for Baze, and you don't want Ryan to know it.<eos> Okay, Abby, enough with the therapy talk.<eos> You got your license, like, online.<eos> One class!<eos> You're rushing to marry Ryan, but the second Baze says he likes you, you freak out.<eos> If you didn't have feelings for Baze, it wouldn't matter to you.<eos> He just told you that he has feelings for you.<eos> The least you can do is appreciate it for one second.<eos> I would.
Or maybe a group of animals working together.<eos> So... that's who you were talking to at the airport, eh?<eos> That crazy American scientist, eh?<eos> ! Well she had nothing to do with it.<eos> All she wants is money.<eos> Let me tell you something. These serrations were made AFTER the explosion.<eos> From sunfish gnawing at the carbon!<eos> I need to dive the river right away.<eos> Told Secretary Grady that I would. We wouldn't want to disappoint Secretary Grady, would we?<eos> No, Colonel, we wouldn't.
It's okay.<eos> We won't eat much.<eos> Leonard had only been with us a short while, but if you saw him walking a trail up at the lakes or riding a horse, you could see that he was home.<eos> So remember the old words.<eos> When a friend dies, we should not cry.<eos> We should not hate someone or fight.<eos> We should do right always.<eos> And we should listen to the old words and remember Leonard.<eos> If anyone else has something to say...<eos> Oh, I would.
Energy Plus.<eos> That means not only am I washing away the filth and the fluids that people get on your hotel sheets, I am also on the front line of the fight against global warming.<eos> What was that?<eos> Foreign object in the wash barrel, it happens.<eos> It looks gooey.<eos> Won't it gum up your machine?<eos> Whatever it is, this baby can handle it.<eos> Okay, so the only way the body could've gotten down here is if someone threw it down a laundry chute.<eos> Well, that would seem to suggest homicide.<eos> Yes, it would.
Two socially awkward creatures, one giant, one tiny clearly out of their element, but willing to try.<eos> I just hoped they did better than Bob at the grill.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> So you have ancestors from France and Belgium? Yes.<eos> Genealogy is so fascinating, don't you think?<eos> I don't know much about that but I'd be interested in hearing what you have to say.<eos> My name's Brick.<eos> So, what do you like to do?<eos> Reverend TimTom, you showed up.<eos> Well, why wouldn't I?
For all his talk of dignity, we know his story now.<eos> And admire him more because of it.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But it will change the way we think of him.<eos> It always does.<eos> I don't see why.<eos> I shouldn't care what I found out about you.<eos> Whatever it was, it wouldn't alter my opinion one bit.<eos> But it would.<eos> It certainly would.
You talk of Mr Molesley's pride?<eos> What about my gardener's pride?<eos> Is he to be sacrificed on the altar of Molesley's ambition?<eos> All I'm asking is that you release them from any obligation to let you win.<eos> Why not just tell them to choose whichever flower is best?<eos> But that is precisely what they already know. And do.<eos> I'm sorry, my lord. I didn't think you'd be in here.<eos> Are my eyes deceiving me or is one of these missing?<eos> - I don't know them well enough.<eos> - No. Why would you?
Are the bags i gave him transmitting?<eos> Clear as day.<eos> Then tell Lieutenant Provenza to swing by and pick up Rick Zuman.<eos> See you later, Captain Raydor.<eos> Drop the bag!<eos> Put your hands in the air.<eos> What's this about?<eos> Officers, please escort this gentleman downtown.<eos> Special Agent Howard, would you like to examine those bills?<eos> Yes, I would.
Great.<eos> How are you at, "ho, ho, ho"?<eos> Chief Johnson, you can now hear the 911 calls made during Shariq's attack on his son.<eos> Oh, I thought you dropped those off at the sound lab yesterday.<eos> I did, but since they won't get to it till tomorrow, I thought maybe your team could sort it out.<eos> First, I combined the background audio from all the calls to our 911 operators during the attack.<eos> Then I added the sound portion of the film one of our witnesses took with his cellphone, after which I managed to cobble together the argument between Armand and his father.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> Would you like to hear it?<eos> Yes, I would.
You doing all right, buddy?<eos> I'm doing great.<eos> And I felt like that right away, too.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> He's... he's doing a lot better.<eos> Thank God.<eos> You'd never know how bad he was before.<eos> No.<eos> I wouldn't.
! Stop it!<eos> Fry, help!<eos> She's turning me into a parade float.<eos> Ew, look at her!<eos> Oh, so you're so shallow that my body disgusts you If it puts on a little extra weight?<eos> That wasn't a little extra weight.<eos> Admit it. You don't care about the inner me at all.<eos> No, you admit it!<eos> You'd be ashamed to be seen in public With someone as hideous as me!<eos> Would not!
Well, then, you have been incredibly helpful.<eos> Where's luka?<eos> Asleep.<eos> His shadow spell was successful.<eos> I was able to track that girl.<eos> However, I did have a little run in With one of the brothers that killed me.<eos> I assume he didn't live to tell about it.<eos> Actually, I spared him.<eos> He'd die before he'd let anything happen to her.<eos> They both would.
- Yeah, Randall's a really good guy.<eos> I think we're gonna have a lot of fun on this one.<eos> Great.<eos> What are you up to for the rest of the day?<eos> Sasha and I are gonna grab a bite to eat.<eos> - All right, enjoy.<eos> - Always.<eos> I'll talk to you later.<eos> He said the meeting with Randall went great.<eos> Why wouldn't it?
- And did you tell him why?<eos> - 'Cause I'm gay.<eos> Did you tell him that you and Nate were... that Nate was, um... did you tell him that Nate was fellating you?<eos> What?<eos> Do you have a merriam-Webster dictionary around here?<eos> I'm sorry, I just... I don't know what that word means.<eos> Oh, come on, Jesse. You know very well what the word means.<eos> No, Paul, I did not tell my father that Nate was sucking my dick.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Why would I?
Will you invite anybody to go with you?<eos> Like who?<eos> Josh, Raif.<eos> They're out of town.<eos> Anyone else?<eos> What were you gonna say?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Nate, but he would never come.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - He just wouldn't.
Was I supposed to do that?<eos> No, no. Yeah.<eos> No, uh, Chloe said she wanted you all to herself tonight.<eos> Yeah, yeah, she said something about wanting to catch the early show at the Clova.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, that's what I said.<eos> Well, we could see a movie any night.<eos> What are you doing right there?<eos> What, you don't want to see a movie with your fiancee?<eos> He'd better!
You might want to get yourself a new boat.<eos> Stick to the water.<eos> Take your wife to venice.<eos> We don't have that kind of money.<eos> We'll call hq in arlington.<eos> See if we can't get you a little reward money.<eos> For your cooperation.<eos> I don't know. If I came across that kind of money, I'd buy myself a '65 harley panhead.<eos> Not me.<eos> I would, uh...
This thing's not working right.<eos> It's like...<eos> One second, Chuck.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Just one.<eos> I just have to...<eos> I hate to make a scene.<eos> But I'll rip your throat out with this plastic fork if you don't tell me who you are and why you're wearing an earpiece.<eos> Well, that certainly would a scene, wouldn't it?
It's a refueling system.<eos> They did not stop any more than they absolutely had to.<eos> I've pulled some hair samples.<eos> I'm certain they're gonna correspond with the hair samples from the crates.<eos> It's the same guys.<eos> These men are hunters.<eos> And if you've ever spent an entire day in a deer blind, you know that you do not want to open those.<eos> You should see your dad.<eos> How would that help the case?<eos> It wouldn't.
6 out of 6 alleles.<eos> Have a seat, Kevin.<eos> I want to help Ryan.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> If you get sick the same way Ryan is, it'll be a problem.<eos> Then Ryan will help me.<eos> I mean, he'll give me his kidney.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> Ryan can't give you his kidney.<eos> But he would.
Not the kind of guy who says "I told you so..." Talk.<eos> Fine.<eos> Move!<eos> Nikola, the door!<eos> All right, what is this place?<eos> As I was trying to say before I was interrupted, we are standing in the wreckage of a secret laboratory belonging to your old enemy, the Cabal.<eos> Must've been a secure off-site location, some kind of research lab.<eos> Bad guys were doing some seriously secret work down here.<eos> It would explain your interest in such a place.<eos> It would.
What did you do that for? !<eos> Rarity, what are you...<eos> My mustache!<eos> How wonderful!<eos> You look smashing!<eos> Oh, Rarity! Your beautiful tail! Oh.<eos> It's fine, my dear.<eos> Short tails are in the season.<eos> Besides, it'll grow back.<eos> So would the mustache...
- Did you guys get a picture?<eos> By the way, Kirk, you can do better than these guys.<eos> I mean, this one is kinda cute, but the other two... Oof!<eos> Show some pride, pal.<eos> Pittsburgh tower.<eos> Foot Long, you are cleared for takeoff on runway two-zero.<eos> Roger that, tower.<eos> Turn and burn.<eos> Honestly, I'd have sex with that guy.<eos> Yeah, I would.
- That's not an answer.<eos> Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?<eos> Because I want to remember what you say right now.<eos> For the love of...<eos> I was a coward.<eos> I was weak.<eos> I wouldn't kill a dragon.<eos> You said "wouldn't".<eos> Whatever!<eos> I wouldn't!
How was he caught?<eos> A security officer saw him in a mall in Phoenix.<eos> His picture is plastered all over the country and he goes to a mall?<eos> People, this is Colonel Kerkmejian.<eos> He'll escort you to view the prisoner.<eos> You're allowed to observe and that's it.<eos> General, when can we interrogate this man?<eos> At the moment, the military is in charge of any interrogation.<eos> If that changes, we'll let you know.<eos> Colonel, if you would.
Hey, Alpha, I think there's something wrong with your collar.<eos> You must've bumped it.<eos> Yeah, your voice sounds funny!<eos> Beta!<eos> Gamma!<eos> Mayhaps you desire to...<eos> Squirrel!<eos> Mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that I have been assigned by my strength and cunning.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> But maybe Dug would.
No. This may be our last chance together,and there are things I have to say-<eos> You don't have to say anything-it's okay.<eos> Listen to me!<eos> I was just like you.<eos> My head in the clouds,full of hope.<eos> I was gonna be a teacher.<eos> And then my power manifested,and the dreams came.<eos> Visions of a bloody future of deceit and death- the apocalypse.<eos> And when I woke... I tried to warn everyone,but no one would listen.<eos> Why would they?
Now why is that?<eos> 'Cause...<eos> I want to be like the girl in this picture, young and alive.<eos> I haven't seen this picture since- I wasn't any older than you there.<eos> You look like a totally different person, so happy.<eos> Don't you miss that?<eos> Well, no.<eos> You're telling me that you wouldn't jump at the chance if you could turn the clock back?<eos> No.<eos> I wouldn't.
Hell, I have no idea.<eos> For a while I thought your nephew shot us.<eos> It was just a guess.<eos> It's a good guess.<eos> One problem.<eos> He's doing a nickel in Concord.<eos> Okay. Your bust.<eos> My bust.<eos> But then the Boston PD would know that.<eos> But a hotshot sheriff from Paradise wouldn't.
I mean...<eos> I actually feel sorry for them, you know.<eos> Like, sneaking around and lying to everybody.<eos> It's, like, so pathetic.<eos> He's a married man.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> Hey, Lisa, you can't, like, tell anybody about this.<eos> Ever.<eos> Of course, I would never.
Oh, sorry.<eos> It gave me such a fright. I, uh...<eos> I didn't know what it was.<eos> Clearly, he's beheaded.<eos> Who would do that to him?<eos> Well, a few questions.<eos> But, look!<eos> Makes you wonder what they're looking at on the fifth floor, right?<eos> You could turn your desk around and just stare at it all day.<eos> I would.
That's how old she was when she had me.<eos> She was like you.<eos> But not a virgin.<eos> That's right, not a virgin.<eos> Are you angry at her?<eos> No.<eos> Not anymore. I used to be.<eos> I don't know what happened, but... all that anger just washed out of me.<eos> So then why not look for her?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Did you hear what I said?<eos> Take it off.<eos> It'd make a wonderful wedding present.<eos> Who for?<eos> - For me.<eos> Who do you think for? For me.<eos> You're just scared I'll make off with it.<eos> No, but I know you.<eos> If I were to offer it to you, you're quite capable of accepting.<eos> Well, why wouldn't I?
Thank you.<eos> That's... I... Well, I appreciate that.<eos> You guys are all right.<eos> Good job.<eos> I...<eos> I'm doing this corporate gig for MySpace and I'm gonna need some jokes and shit.<eos> I was thinking maybe you guys would want to write me some.<eos> You know, he's kind of a flaky guy, but I'm...<eos> I've got nothing going on, man.<eos> I would...
What are you gonna say, Ned?<eos> What?<eos> That he failed again?<eos> That his greatest achievement was just a messed-up little girl?<eos> Ned, please don't!<eos> Bruce?<eos> Bruce?<eos> You want to know what I remember about that last summer?<eos> I remember the Christmas party and not wanting to go and you telling me that I had to go, that I had to take care of my sister to bring her home when she wanted to leave.<eos> But I wouldn't.
It's the least I could do.<eos> I meant what I said about I can't thank you enough, you know, now that it's all over.<eos> What's over?<eos> Working together, being together, just togetherness in general.<eos> It doesn't have to be.<eos> We made a good book together.<eos> We can make another one.<eos> Would you wanna do that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would.
Fine, but I win every "my mother's a fucking horrible person" contest.<eos> To mother issues.<eos> You're lucky, Marshall.<eos> Your mum's there for you.<eos> Look what she made you.<eos> Hey, Nordic.<eos> I just read in Us Weekly that Lance is dating one of the Olsen twins.<eos> Which must be total vindication for Sheryl Crow.<eos> I mean, that guy is just gonna fuck everyone, isn't he?<eos> Hey, I would.
You mean like he's Mick Jagger and we're a bunch of roadies?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We made that motherfucker.<eos> I'd like to be in business with you.<eos> - That I might regret.<eos> - Why do you say that?<eos> 'Cause I've been ripped off before.<eos> That wouldn't happen with me.<eos> - No?<eos> - No, it wouldn't.
Means tomorrow I'm going to the mall to get my hair cut by a slut.<eos> Hey, look what I found.<eos> My beach painting.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Katherine told me it broke.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Yeah, that's what she told me, too.<eos> Only, it didn't.<eos> - That's weird.<eos> Why would she...
And rachel--well, she, uh,<eos> She turned out to be not who I thought she was or at least not anymore.<eos> Dad, you were right about this, but I think you... Need to give me space to make my own mistakes.<eos> Well...<eos> Lucky for you, you'll be at yale soon.<eos> You can make all the mistakes you want, with, god-willing,<eos> b., I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> I know that was rachel that sent the "gossip girl" blast.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't believe you.<eos> Why would you?
Get this- the congressman keeps two apartments in his building<eos> One is for him and the Missus, the other is for "entertaining"<eos> So we know they had a date that night, buit wasn't all fun and games<eos> I mean he even admits they had an argument<eos> Now he claims he got so drunk he passed out<eos> But he saw her trying to steal his wallet So he hit her so hard he split her eye open<eos> Which he only owned up to Because Langston found Amber's blood in the apartment<eos> Now, Humphreys drove her to the emergency room, and he signed her out<eos> He did everything the congressman asked him to do, so if the congressman ordered Humphreys to kill Amber, then why did he show up at her house that afternoon?<eos> He wouldn't
When Kent discovers you found the murder weapon with someone else's prints on it, he's going to fast track himself to an acquittal.<eos> We have the print on the rock, which still puts him at the scene.<eos> But Kent's prints aren't on the hammer.<eos> So, clearly, there was an accomplice who probably committed the murder.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who we still need to identify. Obviously.<eos> Okay, pretrial hearing is in 48 hours.<eos> You're gonna have to reveal the prints then.<eos> It would be nice if Kent would give us a name.<eos> Yeah, well, why would he?
Testing hardware? What am I?<eos> A goddamn prospect.<eos> This ain't about you.<eos> It's about Opie.<eos> It's important we bring him closer.<eos> The deeper in he gets, the more we're protected.<eos> Yeah, and the more you'll hurt Jax.<eos> I don't give a shit about Jax.<eos> How did Otto take it?<eos> The same way any of us would.
It's all my fault!<eos> It's all on me!<eos> I shouldn't have gone to you,<eos> but I was terrified... that you wouldn't come back...<eos> I've lost so many brothers,<eos> I can't bear to lose you!<eos> Your father was right<eos> We cannot develop feelings in battle<eos> If you were me... wouldn't you have come?<eos> I wouldn't
They say they can't find it.<eos> Wait a sec.<eos> What?<eos> There's a five second time difference.<eos> A five second time difference in what?<eos> She rides the elevator twice to the basement.<eos> The first time to put the clothes in the washer, the second time to put them in the dryer.<eos> Only the second time, the trip takes her five seconds longer.<eos> Why would it take her longer to travel the same distance?<eos> It wouldn't.
- He doesn't like cops.<eos> - And what are you, a fed?<eos> - I'll take that as a yes.<eos> - Lieutenant Platko...<eos> You may not know Jimmy, but your daughter does.<eos> I don't have a daughter.<eos> That's not what Lucy says.<eos> You went to see Lucy?<eos> I wanted her to help me find Jimmy.<eos> She wouldn't.
You did after all steal State's secret.<eos> I think that the best we can hope for is life.<eos> Now, all I need is your signature.<eos> Season 1, Episode 14 Ability<eos> Hey.<eos> Mornin'.<eos> Is your father back?<eos> Right here.<eos> Why don't you ask him what he's doing?<eos> I would rather not.
So... what's going on with Sayid?<eos> - Don't know anything yet.<eos> - You don't?<eos> You were at Sawyer's.<eos> What did he tell you?<eos> He told me to leave him alone and let him do his job.<eos> And you're going to?<eos> I'll talk to Juliet, see what she can tell me.<eos> Well, if Sawyer didn't tell you, why would Juliet?<eos> - Why wouldn't she?
That's weird.<eos> Shredded, like our victim's purse.<eos> Maybe Darcy wasn't using it to defend herself.<eos> Beckett.<eos> This one looks different.<eos> It doesn't look like the ones that we found in the other victims' mouths.<eos> I've seen this symbol before.<eos> It's the symbol for death.<eos> Why would a guy mark his own stall with a death symbol?<eos> He wouldn't.
The reason that Jessica calls me all late like she does is that she's a vampire.<eos> - I can't work. - And why is that?<eos> Every time I look at that pool table, I keep seeing you on it and then I can't think about anything else.<eos> - What do you say we get out of here?<eos> - And go where?<eos> Well, we'll sneak out the back and shift, and run and play. Do it out under the sun.<eos> I would love to, but if I left work right now, my boss would kill me.<eos> Don't slap me with a harassment suit for telling you this but if you don't go out back right now and take off all your clothes, I will fire you.<eos> - Well, we wouldn't want that.<eos> - No, we wouldn't.
Can I help you?<eos> On your knees.<eos> Hands on your head. Okay.<eos> What have I got, a tail light out or something?<eos> Magnus...<eos> She had help.<eos> Can I just say, this was really exciting.<eos> You know, when they first asked me to run this project, the subject of maternal feelings came up.<eos> You see, I used to have a daughter.<eos> She'd...
Except we're not keeping it secret.<eos> Okay. My brain just popped a little bit.<eos> So when I said our days are numbered on the cot, well, all I was saying was...<eos> - Eddie.<eos> - All I was saying is that maybe we could be more of a thing, that's all.<eos> I could meet your kid. We don't have to keep hiding all the time.<eos> It'd be nice for a change, huh?<eos> Yeah, it would.<eos> Jackie, Mr. Everett's in the OR and I feel like if we had done more than give him clean clothes and a meal tray the last time, maybe he would still have his foot.<eos> He wouldn't.
She's no exception.<eos> So?<eos> She's obviously suspicious of something.<eos> She can't explain Chris Moore's connection with us.<eos> Would you like to meet her?<eos> Ms. Davidson, I wish to welcome you and let you know that we will provide any medical assistance your father may need.<eos> Is there something you need?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I'm--I'm fine.<eos> I would just...
Why should I feel belonging, When I've never been here before?<eos> Try to ask yourself, do you really think that whole family, those kids, are living their lives - just to deceive you?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> If you're right, there's no way out of here, then.<eos> Can't we have life here?<eos> Isn't that something?<eos> Two people, like your brother, his family...<eos> That's what they want us to think.<eos> 313, you ever been on a boat?<eos> Why would I?
Try to ask yourself, Do you really think that whole family, those kids, Are living their lives just to deceive you?<eos> Maybe.<eos> If you're right, There's no way out of here, then.<eos> Can't we have life here?<eos> isn't that something?<eos> Two people, like your brother,<eos> His family-- no-no-no-no-no.<eos> That's what they want us to think.<eos> 313, you ever been on a boat?<eos> Why would i?
I need you.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> I know.<eos> Last time I was here... I couldn't wait to get away.<eos> This time, I want to stay forever.<eos> Well, you can't.<eos> You said yourself, you have to go back there.<eos> Now you're the one who can't wait to go.<eos> - Can you take my case, please?<eos> - Well, I would but, erm...
Ever.<eos> One vampire falling in love is bad enough.<eos> Yes. Bill Compton certainly has a knack for finding trouble.<eos> For instance, how does he know I'm having you sell vampire blood?<eos> The guards hear everything.<eos> Your Majesty, I'm sorry.<eos> - There's no way he could...<eos> - That is really bad.<eos> He does not know that you are supplying it.<eos> He'd better not.
You won't tell Sam about this, will you?<eos> What you need to understand about me, Clint, is I'm someone you can trust.<eos> I can trust you?<eos> Did I say "can"?<eos> Sorry, I meant to say "can't".<eos> I'm someone you can't trust.<eos> Please!<eos> Don't tell her about this.<eos> - I'll think about it.<eos> - I would,
You look great.<eos> Last night was rough.<eos> Marlo froze all my assets, my credit cards.<eos> I couldn't get $5.<eos> Lizzie wouldn't take me in. I slept in my car.<eos> Thank God we live in LA. It's 70 degrees.<eos> I don't know where I'm gonna go.<eos> - Go home.<eos> - Come on, Marlo would never have me.<eos> Actually, she would.
Is Sage inside your pocket?<eos> She's hiding here.<eos> You gotta look in your pocket first.<eos> No, I don't, because I found you already.<eos> Now I just need to check your incision site, so...<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> It hurts.<eos> I bet that mr. Bear would like to see Sage's scar.<eos> Wouldn't you, mr. Bear?<eos> Yes, I would.
But to order it, it's four-ninety-nine.<eos> Well, I guess we can add five more bucks to your tab. Five dollars?<eos> For Barbra Does Céline?<eos> No! Oh, no.<eos> Ridiculous.<eos> No, $499.<eos> Streisand comes expensive or she doesn't come at all.<eos> Forget it!<eos> I wouldn't pay that much to see Barbra do Céline!<eos> Or would I?
- What?<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> - What?<eos> - Don't hate me, Addie.<eos> I am your friend.<eos> I am your friend who slept with your brother and didn't tell you, and I know what that did to you, and I want to be your friend and I don't want<eos> - to keep secrets from you...<eos> - Oh, my God, Nai. You slept with the captain.<eos> - No, no, Addie.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Miss Madison, I'm Daniel Golden.<eos> We, uh, spoke on the phone.<eos> You look good, Peter.<eos> I always liked you in a suit.<eos> We have issues that we have to deal with... this book and your appearances.<eos> Yes, still a lot of pillow talk to talk about.<eos> You phoned my wife.<eos> That's always what it comes down to.<eos> Men and their wives.<eos> I'd like
There's a handprint in the center back of this chair right here.<eos> He pulled this chair out for himself.<eos> Over here, there are handprints on either side of the chair.<eos> He pulled this chair out for her, poured her wine...<eos> And even cleaned up after the meal was done.<eos> But up he something changed.<eos> Then he drew her a bath. And this is where Melissa Johnson was murdered.<eos> This is where the fantasy ended.<eos> Because she broke it?<eos> I would.
She's no exception.<eos> So?<eos> She's obviously suspicious of something.<eos> She can't explain Chris Moore's connection with us.<eos> Would you like to meet her?<eos> Ms. Davidson, I wish to welcome you and let you know that we will provide any medical assistance your father may need.<eos> Is there something you need?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I'm--I'm fine.<eos> I would just...
- Starting to miss it?<eos> - Right about now I am.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Zero, back to the car.<eos> Attaboy.<eos> You know, I'm not proud about the way things ended between us.<eos> Conversation's over.<eos> Playing Little House on the Prairie with a schoolteacher, I mean, that just isn't you, Logan.<eos> And you would know, huh?<eos> - I would.
I'm not making excuses, but the doctor said...<eos> Idiot.<eos> You know someone a bunch of years, and it's easy to forget that you were fortunate enough to have known them for even one day.<eos> And that was Lucky, to me.<eos> I mean, he was my friend.<eos> He... Well, even more important, he was my family.<eos> And where was I when he was breathing his last breath?<eos> In Japan, making a business deal.<eos> Is there anyone who would like to say anything about Lucky - before we say goodbye?<eos> - I would.
Er, no, no.<eos> And there was no sign of a struggle in the house of Mlle Pebmarsh?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Then I would like to interview the neighbours today, if I may.<eos> Already done.<eos> There are the statements. Non.<eos> Poirot would like to ask questions of his own.<eos> Yes. Already done it.<eos> I would like to ask questions of my own, Inspector Hardcastle.<eos> Of course you would.
What about you?<eos> You're about to drag my brother. -Back into your psycho- melodramatic-romantic. -"psycho-melodramatic"?<eos> I don't know what. Jason's coming back from malaysia?<eos> He's already having a date with him!<eos> It's not a date,okay?<eos> We agreed to meet for lunch so we can talk. You know what?<eos> I'm allowed to.<eos> I'm single.<eos> I can change my mind if I want to.<eos> not that I would,okay?
- in the first place.<eos> - Bobby, just stop.<eos> I really believed in you.<eos> And I thought that you were one of the few kids in school that didn't need to be popular.<eos> I'm recommending that Tad get your summer scholarship.<eos> What?<eos> I'm late for AP English.<eos> Smooth move, Doctor Love.<eos> You actually think I went to all the trouble of stealing the SATs just so I could go out with Francesca?<eos> I would.
I didn't know Val was gonna put it round the entire nick.<eos> She's the biggest gobshite of them all!<eos> I thought she was a sweet old dinner lady.<eos> - Yvonne!<eos> Open the door!<eos> - A good sarge knows her staff.<eos> I can tell you the names of everyone who works at our nick.<eos> Fine.<eos> But do you know them?<eos> - A good sarge would.
I know that look.<eos> Have you laid one on for me?<eos> Have you? Huh?<eos> Patrick?<eos> Patrick, you have, haven't you, so?<eos> Come on away.<eos> Two Guinness, son.<eos> Oh, is this her?<eos> She would do me.<eos> She fucking wouldn't.
- Yeah, you did.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> All right, I'll see you later, okay?<eos> Love you.<eos> - Love you, too.<eos> - Happy birthday!<eos> - You, too!<eos> Hello, sir. Would you like to buy some cookies?<eos> I would.
- Sorry.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> All right, I'll see you later, okay?<eos> Love you.<eos> - Love you, too.<eos> - Happy birthday!<eos> - You, too!<eos> Hello, sir. Would you like to buy some cookies?<eos> I would.<eos> I really would. I just...
This is a judgment call.<eos> We can hold Chuck here until we know for sure.<eos> -His cover was blown, he's gone.<eos> -No.<eos> I will take full responsibility.<eos> Chuck is my asset.<eos> He's my guy.<eos> Just give us more time, please.<eos> I'd appreciate it.<eos> I really would.
No<eos> Well you know if you've got a spare night.<eos> And How do I reach you?<eos> You'll find me under 'Lovers' in the Yellow Pages.<eos> Yeah I know pretty shitty line.<eos> There you go.<eos> Well I'm Stephanie but I'm sure you know that.<eos> Sam.<eos> Sam, you haven't been sending me e-mails or photos<eos> Why would I?
And I trust that wherever she is, some Army major is looking after her the way I try to look after the people under my charge.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Where did that come from?<eos> - The fax in Beck's office.<eos> You know, I've seen that before.<eos> Been coming through Beck's fax machine for days, but I've just been throwing them away.<eos> Yeah, that's what you're supposed to do.<eos> If there was no other way to reach each other, the members of my team had a method of communicating in the open so that no one could read it but us.<eos> - Is it from Chavez? - No.<eos> He would...
I don't think that's us.<eos> Tempting, though.<eos> Sure would send the message.<eos> Does the spinster get a vote?<eos> Stop that,and of course you do.<eos> This isn't about us.<eos> This is about our friend who we've known for 15 years now who hates surprises, by the way, so you two be juliet for a moment.<eos> So, juliet, if davis was dipping his wick in cilia grey, would you want to know?<eos> - Dipping his wick?<eos> - Damn right I would.
Jenna this and Jenna that.<eos> Mom, I've got a man crush on Brad Pitt.<eos> It doesn't mean I'm gay.<eos> I just want her to have a normal childhood.<eos> I don't think it's bad to be gay.<eos> I'm not saying it's bad. I just don't think I want Birdy to be like...that.<eos> Life would be easier for her if she wasn't.<eos> I sure as hell wouldn't want any a son of mine growing up queer.<eos> Jim!<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
You need to get in shape, Vice.<eos> We need you around. Three heart attacks is three too many.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. President if there was an E. coli breakout in a produce farm in Maryland would you take the chance of eating the lettuce in that sandwich?<eos> Why are you bringing this up?<eos> I mean, you know I got tasters in the kitchen.<eos> If there was a 1 percent chance of you dying, sir would you eat the lettuce in that sandwich?<eos> One percent?<eos> No. Probably not.<eos> Most people wouldn't, sir.
Are you? Yes, I am.<eos> I'm not really after, you know...<eos> Thanks.<eos> Um... actually, I'm in a weird place and, um...<eos> - Well, I've got to, er...<eos> - I was just playing with you.<eos> Everyone loves my tits.<eos> I was just having a laugh.<eos> - Yeah, whatever. - Seemed like he fancied me.<eos> Or he would with a little push.
But, ah, it's probably something I can deal with myself, actually.<eos> Business?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Someone's undercutting them.<eos> Selling really cheap stuff all over town.<eos> Sorry, mate, I can't help you.<eos> No, appreciate it.<eos> Hey, Lewis, has Jason talked to his lawyer this week?<eos> Should he?<eos> I would.
Why did you kill her?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't kill your daughter.<eos> Then what are you doing here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Right back at you.<eos> So,crocotta,huh?<eos> Yep.<eos> That would explain the flies.<eos> Yeah,it would.
Nope.<eos> Anything he wouldn't say Tohut this down Before it got too loud?<eos> That night... At her house,<eos> Jenny gave her Gun to the frog.<eos> You have the bullets.<eos> Take the damn gun!<eos> Protect yourself.<eos> She did.<eos> And that would explain How it got to the yacht.<eos> It would.
Well, i need money, nico.<eos> Well, i'll pay you 200 bucks not to work the party.<eos> How's that? Ugly.<eos> Look, that's not what i meant.<eos> I just don't recall Signing up to work with that agency.<eos> Kirby, victory is slammed.<eos> I'm gonna be filling that room with colleagues and friends.<eos> You know a lot of these people.<eos> Won't you find that embarrassing?<eos> No. But obviously, you would.
- I hope we find it because I'm starting to cramp like a... Son of a bitch.<eos> Quit whining.<eos> No, Sam, I mean, son of a bitch.<eos> So?<eos> Our apple-bobbing cheerleader?<eos> Tracy, the Wallace's babysitter.<eos> She told me she'd never even heard of Luke Wallace.<eos> Interesting look for a centuries-old witch.<eos> If you were a 600-year-old hag and you could pick any costume to come back in, wouldn't you go for a hot cheerleader?<eos> I would.
Yes, but he's not wrong about this.<eos> If it reaches the conduit, it will have access to virtually unlimited power.<eos> - And what would happen?<eos> - The growth would increase exponentially.<eos> And since we've shut this section down, we have no sensors in the area, so the only way to know how far it's penetrated is to do a visual inspection.<eos> All right, assemble a team.<eos> I need some answers, Doctor.<eos> How do we kill this thing?<eos> Well, we're working on a genetically engineered virus that might be capable of destroying the pathogen that's infecting Dr. Keller, but that wouldn't eliminate the biopolymer itself.<eos> What would?
I need to get away from here.<eos> From people.<eos> We should send her home.<eos> She's got grade three previa.<eos> She's also got the most viable fetus we've ever seen.<eos> More reason to have her in a hospital under constant supervision.<eos> For a doctor, you can be amazingly stupid.<eos> She should be delivered.<eos> It's too early. Besides, the baby might not survive.<eos> At least the girl would.
I've got enough to charge you with, Hector.<eos> We just wanna know your side of the story.<eos> How did you two meet?<eos> Oprah and Dr. Phil here.<eos> I told her this is how it was going to end.<eos> Only it was going to be me that died and her sitting here with dumb cops asking dumb questions.<eos> "Why was a respectable girl like you with a thug like Hector Romerez?"<eos> Why was she?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Sure, she would.
Previously on...<eos> We had an agreement to keep things casual.<eos> Susan made her feelings clear.<eos> So if I was with another woman, that wouldn't bother you?<eos> No, it wouldn't.
And. this is suppose to get him to come home?<eos> I have to respect myself.<eos> And more importantly I need you to respect me.<eos> And please. don't tell me you do.<eos> So,this is it.<eos> This is it.<eos> we're gonna be okay.<eos> How?<eos> I was kind of hoping you would have an answer for that one.<eos> Normally would.
Passes to DeBusschere.<eos> DeBusschere looks for Willis Reed, but Reed's being double-teamed, so Dave finds Phil Jackson.<eos> Jackson finds Sammy Tyler at the top of the key.<eos> Tyler shoots!<eos> Nothing but net.<eos> Hey, my kid's a big Knicks fan.<eos> Sammy's in danger, isn't he?<eos> Rose also?<eos> I mean, the Pignatos are surely gonna come after them.<eos> Why wouldn't they?
Why would I hope to find the prick?<eos> This guy thinks he's a super cop, he can make his own rules.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - Can my wife watch?<eos> Hey, listen, kiddo, seriously, he's probably out there tearing K-town a new asshole.<eos> You think so?<eos> Two more K-town killers dead on his clock that's three murders in two days.<eos> If that turns out to be a hit list we could have a gang war brewing.<eos> Yeah, Kenny, but he hasn't even returned the captain's calls.<eos> Neither would I.
I assume you'll be paying this out of the gate receipts?<eos> - Of course, I'll want it in the form of a guarantee.<eos> Plus I get a percentage of the overages.<eos> Of course.<eos> In the neighbourhood of 5%.<eos> I was thinking a little more uptown.<eos> - 10?<eos> - 25.<eos> I'll understand if you decline.<eos> Most teams would.
All we got to do is...<eos> Look. I'm going to level with you, okay?<eos> I kind of bombed out on the whole water and light fairy things, and I'm starting to run out of options here.<eos> If you could see fit to flap your little wings and take flight for a few measly seconds, I might be able to go to the mainland and bring happiness to the world!<eos> What do you say?<eos> Wrong answer.<eos> If I end up making acorn kettles for the rest of my life, I am holding you personally responsible.<eos> Hey, hey. Look at this!<eos> Okay, just stop squirming.<eos> Would you just... Hey!
And even though I couldn't see him or hear him, I could feel him.<eos> That's why I don't think Walter's dead.<eos> I can still feel him.<eos> Mrs. Collins...<eos> - No.<eos> I know what the police said.<eos> But that place and the remains, they couldn't be properly identified.<eos> And maybe that kid made a mistake when he picked Walter's picture.<eos> I understand you don't want to accept this.<eos> What mother would?
What about this...<eos> In the year of the dragon it brings good luck.<eos> I need the panda.<eos> Don't lose this one.<eos> Once you hit the stream, you wanna head northwest, pretty much in a straight line for about a day and a half.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm gonna have to tell Jack.<eos> But I'll give you guys a nice, long head start.<eos> I'd tell him myself, but he wouldn't understand.<eos> No, he wouldn't
...because she knew he still belonged to her.<eos> Feel free to take home as much cake as you want.<eos> - I do not want to be tempted.<eos> - I might take a little for Tom...<eos> Hi, Mrs. McCluskey.<eos> Would you like some cake?<eos> I didn't come for sweets.<eos> I know you've been talking about me, and I guess the only way to shut you up is to come clean.<eos> So who would like to hear the gruesome details?<eos> - I would.
Always watching.<eos> DANNY: Jillian?<eos> Hi, Danny.<eos> Good news about Nessa, huh? Nessa?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Ed just told me that Nessa's in town and that she's with Delinda.<eos> Why would Ed tell you that?<eos> So, she's not in town?<eos> Danny, I would know if the daughter I haven't seen for two years was here.<eos> Yeah, of course you would.
It's far from good.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Gideon's apartment.<eos> No sign of forced entry.<eos> Why?<eos> Everything is as it was.<eos> Nothing has been disturbed.<eos> Wine poured but not drank.<eos> The victim simply let the assailant in.<eos> And why wouldn't she?
I guess I could just sit on a bed.<eos> Wow, this is soft.<eos> Sure feels weird lying on top of the covers.<eos> Sure feels weird lying in bed with my pants on.<eos> What in the name of...?<eos> Hey, you !<eos> Whoa!<eos> How many?<eos> Are you sleeping in the middle of my department store?<eos> Well... who wouldn't with an incredible mattress like this?
He's become an excellent litigator and a solid citizen.<eos> Shirley, Paul, have a nice evening.<eos> Glor— Alan.<eos> I'm new at this, uh, relationship game.<eos> Not so much new, I guess, as, uh—<eos> Rusty.<eos> Just so I'm clear, if I'm ever even... slightly attracted to another woman, I should just lie about that?<eos> Through your teeth.<eos> Really? Why would you tolerate dishonesty from your partner?<eos> I wouldn't.
Is something wrong?<eos> The doctorfrom last night-- he was killed in an explosionsoon after he left us.<eos> Wha-what?<eos> The doctor who wassupposed to fix me?<eos> Tell me what this is.<eos> A... a nasty... nsa incinerator.<eos> Special issue designed toeliminate all biological traces.<eos> That's what killed the doctor.<eos> And guess who worksfor the nsa?<eos> -Why... why,why would casey...
Just one question.<eos> Am i the only one who thinks this is extremely weird?<eos> I-i mean,given everything.<eos> Dan,just forget about it.<eos> If dad can let it go,so can you.<eos> What do you mean,let it go?<eos> You know,the guy in hudson.<eos> You told her?<eos> No,of course i didn't tell her. Rufus.<eos> I would never.
Your handwriting sucks.<eos> What the hell does this say?<eos> That's the name here and that's,that's a,well,that's an A.<eos> and the license plate... that's an n and- oh- that's a V.<eos> That's nevada.<eos> You think?<eos> Sidle: Green bloat stage.<eos> He's been here at least 18 hours.<eos> Do you ever wonder why ants don't crawl up the nose,eat the brains?<eos> I would.
The doctor found a lump last week and they took a biopsy and it wasn't pretty.<eos> You didn't tell me about that.<eos> Well, it's no big deal until it's a big deal.<eos> Now it's a big deal.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Die, probably.<eos> Betty.<eos> Nobody gets out alive, kid.<eos> Well, aren't you going to fight it?<eos> I would.
Sorry about the lights.<eos> Here you are, watch your step.<eos> I mean you've got to think fixer-upper.<eos> But there's a lot of potential here, there's a lot of... rooms.<eos> OK.<eos> I can read a face, me.<eos> There's a couple of rentals in Hammersmith, they'd probably be more up your street.<eos> I mean this place...<eos> I know I shouldn't say it, but quite honestly, I wouldn't lock up my worst enemy in this place.<eos> I would.
- You and your head take the night off.<eos> - It's just that she's a girl.<eos> Mothers know more when it comes to girls !<eos> I'm shutting down for the night.<eos> Unless you need anything ?<eos> No, uh...<eos> But, uh, here's... Uh... Here's your cake carrier.<eos> - You ate the whole thing ?<eos> - We. [Stammers] I didn't eat a whole cake.<eos> I... I wouldn't.
I'm talking to your wife.<eos> Arthur Riggs has nothing to do with this.<eos> Really?<eos> His daughter ID'd him... as the man who muscled your son into his car.<eos> What?<eos> I showed this photo to you two hours ago.<eos> You told me you didn't recognize him.<eos> Because I couldn't make out his face. I...<eos> - it never occurred to me.<eos> - And why would it?
- She saw it also?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And we were both absolutely terrified.<eos> - OK.<eos> - I mean, you know, couldn't even move.<eos> You know, you just...<eos> It was just... It was horrifying.<eos> And we would just pray.<eos> Please, please let it just go away.<eos> And then, eventually, it would.
Not only that,<eos> The informant says That two men grabbed him, Brought him to a car and placed Him inside none too gently.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> We were so careful.<eos> We have Sasha locked up, So how did they know?<eos> How in the hell Did they know?<eos> "traitor Kukushkin trial-- Spied for Americans,<eos> Betrayer Of the motherland."<eos> You'd think It'd get easier over time.<eos> What would?
- Is it, really?<eos> - Yeah. Oh, I'm so disappointed.<eos> What character did you relate to the most?<eos> I didn't relate to any of the characters.<eos> The one character that I might've related with is probably Meg.<eos> Do you think Jesus, if he would've come back, would enjoy Family Guy?<eos> Definitely not.<eos> No. No.<eos> If he would've had the network, would he cancel Family Guy?<eos> Yes, he would.
I thought who better to ask than my Canadian relatives.<eos> Bob and Estelle.<eos> But they wouldn't cross the border into America.<eos> They wanted me to meet them at Sears. In Canada.<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> - We're buying insurance.<eos> - We're going to the States to see you.<eos> Right, that's just across the river.<eos> You wouldn't go over to see us in Michigan for a couple of hours without insurance?<eos> No, we wouldn't.
That-<eos> I'd talk about your father. I'd talk about who he really was.<eos> Let's talk about damages, Miss Perlmutter.<eos> Bob Satterfield was a great figure in American sports.<eos> Nah, he wasn't none of that.<eos> He a pretty good boxer with a glass jaw.<eos> But he was a very good man.<eos> And a good father, and I'd- I'd like for people to know that.<eos> Would you put that in your story?<eos> I would.
This soup you're making is disgusting. - Oh, thank you.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> It's been four days.<eos> Not that I was keeping track.<eos> I just thought maybe...<eos> I know Lucy told you.<eos> I knew she would.<eos> So I wouldn't have...<eos> So I wouldn't...
Ever.<eos> I'm gonna stop you from eating too much salad.<eos> We gotta get the Strip Steak because they said the Strip Steak, that's why everybody comes here.<eos> I think maybe I'll stick to seafood tonight.<eos> Why would you have fish in a steak restaurant?<eos> You can get whatever you want.<eos> Would you go to a seafood restaurant and have a steak?<eos> Yeah, maybe, if I wanted a steak.<eos> You would?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Do not let the assassin escape.<eos> Release the gas.<eos> Lock down the doors.<eos> I suggest you and your men follow me.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Your man has made a mistake.<eos> There is no exit.<eos> He's trapped.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> Why would he?
Gus, Joanne, the most important trip of our lives is in the morning, so let's get plenty of sleep.<eos> I'm going home. - Jailbait, slap my hands!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Mario, this is all on me.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> He may be in trouble with the press, but he stayed out of jail.<eos> You don't see God's hand in this?<eos> Well, reasonable people can disagree, but I don't see God anywhere within miles of this.<eos> On the other hand, if you slept with me tonight, I bet you I could change my mind in a hurry.<eos> - Oh, you would.
Hey...<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Come on. - I'm feeling a little dizzy, Joe.<eos> Everything's all... (EX CLAIMS)<eos> - Dizzy?<eos> - I think it might be from that funny yellow soft drink Joe gave me last night.<eos> What was it called again?<eos> (MUMBLES)<eos> Margarita?<eos> - You wouldn't.
- Let's go.<eos> Come on. - I'm feeling a little dizzy, Joe.<eos> Everything's all... (EX CLAIMS)<eos> - Dizzy?<eos> - I think it might be from that funny yellow soft drink Joe gave me last night.<eos> What was it called again?<eos> (MUMBLES)<eos> Margarita?<eos> - You wouldn't.<eos> - You wouldn't.
Quiet!<eos> Quiet!<eos> I said quiet!<eos> Let's go!<eos> JOE:<eos> Everybody, I need a tight formation, right now, in front.<eos> Tight formation, everybody.<eos> Calling an audible.<eos> Fifty-nine razor.<eos> What would...
No, no tequila.<eos> Only sodas.<eos> No, taquitos. - Eh?<eos> - Taquitos.<eos> Taquito?<eos> Look, if you said spaghetti, I wouldn't be confused.<eos> Taquito.<eos> And then he hit me with two lefts and a huge right, and then I realized how do I know the guy beating the crap out of me is actually gay?<eos> 'Cause no one else would be stupid enough to pretend they were gay to enter a boxing tournament.<eos> Or would they?
Shit!<eos> Where the fuck are they?<eos> Theron, PRC6!<eos> Sun, this is Rock.<eos> Enemy 100 meters above!<eos> They're hitting us with MG-42s.<eos> Roger.<eos> Go after them.<eos> They need help.<eos> I wouldn't.
What happened, Franklin? Are you all right?<eos> Doreen!<eos> I... I can't see anything.<eos> Don't worry, Franklin.<eos> I know how it is.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> The computer short-circuited.<eos> I need to activate the time machine and bring the gang back!<eos> Doreen...<eos> - would you...
How's Joe?<eos> Dead. Joe died of his burns while you were asleep.<eos> We were just too late.<eos> I told you this would come!<eos> Oh, God, I thought I was dreaming her voice.<eos> No dream.<eos> She's getting people whipped up.<eos> That poor girl is dead, and that boy is burnt in the back room!<eos> She's got 'em believing she's a psychic, she has a direct line with God.<eos> Why wouldn't they?
Franny said he could help, but then he said he couldn't.<eos> You're talking about a building in the neighborhood.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Pick a building, Franny could tell you who owns it, when they bought it, who they bought it from, and how much they cheated the previous owner out of.<eos> At least he could when I knew him.<eos> What if we made it look like a suicide?<eos> How we gonna do that?<eos> We slice up his wrists and when that didn't work, he started stabbing himself.<eos> I would believe that.<eos> Yeah, but nobody else would.
It integrates the phone lines with the security system.<eos> Maybe it just went off-line.<eos> I'd really appreciate your help.<eos> Okay.<eos> If I see someone, I'll flag 'em down.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> What was it that Paul drank?<eos> It was this mixture that he made out of industrial- strength cleaners because he couldn't find one that was strong enough.<eos> Why would Paul have a cockroach problem?<eos> He wouldn't.
- What happen to his brother?<eos> - Well, he died.<eos> Cancer more than a year ago, but see, Jared doesn't remember.<eos> As far as he's concerned, his brother was alive when he went into surgery and gone when he woke up, so...<eos> In a sens, yeah...<eos> I'm responsible.<eos> I took the memory of his brother away from him and that's why he comes after me.<eos> He actually believes that he is a victim of some sort of grand conspiracy and that I'm, some king of lean leader.<eos> How would somebody know if they had this... condition?<eos> Other than the seizures? They... They probably wouldn't but...
We probably shouldn't talk, though, unless we're wearing full body condoms.<eos> What if I wasn't coming back because they offered me a permanent position here?<eos> Did they?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We sat there all night and talked about everything.<eos> How we felt about each other.<eos> Whether we could handle a long-distance relationship.<eos> Did she ever see herself coming back to Sacred Heart?<eos> Would a pizza place deliver to a bench at 3:00 in the morning?<eos> They would.
The credit goes to you.<eos> You really changed.<eos> So I had to change?<eos> It's a compliment.<eos> You were fine.<eos> You're different<eos> Since that stuff last year--<eos> The shooting.<eos> - I'm sure Carm would agree.<eos> - I would.
- I'm glad you feel that way.<eos> - Oh, yeah, I know, I know.<eos> Before this is all over, I'm going to have to find all the courage I can muster.<eos> Actually, you're going to need to find it right now.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Teyla!<eos> Teyla, this is Atlantis, do you read?<eos> Teyla, this is Sheppard, come in.<eos> - She wouldn't turn off her radio.<eos> - No, she wouldn't.
And I don't.<eos> I don't know your situation, Jerry. But would you like to get a drink with me?<eos> Now?<eos> Never mind.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> Forget I said that.<eos> No, that's— I-I would love to get a drink.<eos> You don't have to say that. No, I would.<eos> –No, no, no, no!<eos> –I would!
I warned the brothers what would happen if they failed.<eos> If I give them more time now I may as well hand them a condom and a cigarette to go with it.<eos> You know, I came all the way down here.<eos> The least you could do is offer me an opinion.<eos> I thought we agreed it was best for you to not come here.<eos> And I thought you needed to be out in seven days.<eos> I need to know how this delay is gonna affect things.<eos> Well, it won't be comfortable, but it will be possible.<eos> Well, thank you, James, but that doesn't exactly ravage me with confidence.<eos> - And what would?
Much more, I have the certainty.<eos> Do you miss your father?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> I love those brown eyes.<eos> What do you do with your life?<eos> Knew that question was coming.<eos> It's a normal question.<eos> I told you.<eos> 20.000 € to dance in a private school.<eos> Great Opportunity what else would a girl?
-Would you ever change your name?<eos> -What for?<eos> -Would you?<eos> -No.<eos> What's it to you, anyway?<eos> I don't want to go from Camilla Lopez to Camilla Bandini.<eos> It's not much of an improvement.<eos> Who asked you to go anywhere?<eos> -You'd ask me.<eos> -No, I wouldn't.

Say, "Thank you. "<eos> What?<eos> I'm just not into making big speeches.<eos> What do you do when you leave somebody's house?<eos> You don't just turn around-<eos> I don't make a big speech.<eos> A big weepy speech.<eos> Oh, that's it!<eos> You're afraid that you're gonna cry!<eos> I wouldn't.
I need you to find him culpable.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Good luck.<eos> Luck's for the Irish, McKenzie.<eos> Hello, Alex.<eos> My name's Sally Rowe.<eos> I'm a forensic psychologist.<eos> I've been asked to talk to you to find out what happened.<eos> Would you like someone present during this interview?<eos> Would you?
Hooked in something... Someone?<eos> No.<eos> No, not someone.<eos> I just-<eos> - I'm having a time getting used to the move and everything.<eos> - I won't take it personally.<eos> Okay.<eos> Blow me off again, I will.<eos> Should I take that under advisement?<eos> - Yes. I would.
Massgraves from 2 years ago!<eos> How excessiv is that!<eos> We had Echelon 2 years ago, Gianni.<eos> We had listning stations...<eos> - Which is way Tumbleweed.<eos> - Do you really think.<eos> If some commited people really want it to hurt us..<eos> You think they couldnt manage?<eos> You think we hear them coming?<eos> We wouldnt!
- Yes.<eos> Your friends.<eos> - Our friends.<eos> If they were our friends, Martijn, I would know who they are.<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> You are lying.<eos> I've only said this much to convince you I'm not CIA.<eos> - Then why did you not tell this to Ahmat?<eos> - Because he'd never believe me.<eos> - And I would?
He don't wanna check for that because he's still on Alisa, isn't it?<eos> Man, I'll show you now I can chat to that girl, man.<eos> Go on then.<eos> - Why is he always on our hype, man?<eos> - He thinks he's big, man.<eos> - Hey, can I help you?<eos> - Do you work here?<eos> No, sorry, just making conversation.<eos> I wouldn't buy these trainers, though.<eos> - Seriously, I wouldn't.
You're eating a lot of shit lately.<eos> What?<eos> -I said, you're eating a lot of shit lately.<eos> -So what?<eos> So I can see it on your ass.<eos> I'm just telling you because, you know I thought you'd want to me to tell if I noticed that.<eos> What made you think I'd want you to tell me if my ass was getting fat?<eos> Because I guess I'd want you to tell me if I was gaining weight.<eos> -Really, you'd want me to tell you?<eos> -Yes, I would.
-Sweetheart, look at this.<eos> -So weird.<eos> Tandem bike.<eos> We could get that and ride that.<eos> How long would that take?<eos> Does anyone know what a Donzi boat is?<eos> -I don't.<eos> -Oh, my God.<eos> Who would pay to walk on Nip/Tuck?<eos> Oh, God, I would.
And, you know, when I saw you crying the other night, that was honestly the worst moment of my life.<eos> Gary.<eos> Let me just try to say some of these things here.<eos> It's just...<eos> Look, I know that I've caused you a lot of pain.<eos> And the funny thing is, all I really want to do is make you happy.<eos> I just want to make you smile.<eos> Now, I've had a lot of time to think about some of the things that went on, and I know, Brooke, that I don't always do the right thing or always say the right things, but I am willing to try to do things differently.<eos> And I'd be happy to go take a dance class.<eos> Well, I would.
I trust Jorge.<eos> Where's Jorge?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What's Paula going to do when she gets out?<eos> Get a B.A. in Language Studies.<eos> Although she'd rather do social work.<eos> Help women in her same situation.<eos> Say that again...<eos> Get a B.A. in Language Studies.<eos> Though she'd rather...
She was put to 'The Question'.<eos> I thought that kind of 'investigation' had been abandoned years ago.<eos> Yes, it was, but now in these troubled times, in its quest for the truth, the Church is bringing it back.<eos> So... you maintain that a confession obtained by the means of as you call it 'The Question' is valid proof of anything?<eos> This is not an opinion of one simple monk, sir.<eos> It is a tenet of Church teaching that a confession attained by 'The Question' constitutes ultimate proof.<eos> I'm sorry, Lorenzo, but how can this sort of confession be an ultimate proof?<eos> If I were tortured, I'd confess to anything.<eos> I'd confess I was the Turkish sultan.<eos> No, you wouldn't.

Well, I never... I thought I was comfortably off with L100 saved up.<eos> Wouldn't you like to have a farm?<eos> My sister could help me find one. She's very practically minded.<eos> I don't think I'd want a woman to set me up.<eos> I'm not just any woman.<eos> And anyway, it wouldn't be just setting you up. You could start the farm, then I could come and live with you.<eos> If we decide to get divorced and live together.<eos> You'd never want to live with me on a farm.<eos> - You'd never want to be Mrs Oliver Parkin.<eos> - I would! Why wouldn't I?
I didn't say.<eos> You look really nice.<eos> You don't need to humor me, Miss Veigh.<eos> Save that for the children.<eos> I feel like we've gotten off on the wrong foot somehow, and it's all my fault.<eos> Do you smoke?<eos> No.<eos> You were saying?<eos> I'd like us to be friends.<eos> Would you now?
This battle has to be fast and clear<eos> We'll end this up with Ge Li<eos> New boots?<eos> No problem, Mr. Ge Li it will be ready when you come back<eos> I disagreed on the massacre last night, but...<eos> You can't stop them...<eos> I always think that killing enemies is a kind of glory... where will you go after the battle ends?<eos> Wherever needs me, I'll be there<eos> What if Zhao is being invaded and ask for your help will you go?<eos> Of course I would
Please just relax for one second, okay?<eos> I still have a hard-on here.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> I went to sleep, I woke up, the dog was gone.<eos> No Lola, no dog.<eos> Okay, why would she steal your dog?<eos> 'Cause she's a thieving stripper!<eos> I wouldn't steal your dog. Oh, really?<eos> What if you thought you could get a lot of money for him?<eos> Well, then, yeah, I would. Yeah.
But whatever happens, I need you to understand.<eos> I do... understand, Charles. I do.<eos> Mr President.<eos> It has been a challenging day, so I especially appreciate how professional you have all been.<eos> Your president is fortunate to have such talented people working for him. Thank you.<eos> Mr President, I'm glad we have this opportunity to thank you and Mrs Logan personally for your hospitality.<eos> Mr President, it's been our pleasure.<eos> Hold on.<eos> We would love that.<eos> Wouldn't we, Martha? Yes.
- You don't know anything about her.<eos> - On the contrary, sir, I know everything there is to know about Paige Matthews, thank you.<eos> - Where is she ticklish?<eos> - Ticklish?<eos> Third toe, left foot.<eos> Right below the neck.<eos> Did you know she only salts popcorn on the right side, never on the left?<eos> And every time she watches The Wizard of Oz, she cries.<eos> Every time, did you know that?<eos> No, why would you?
- Not anymore, it's not.<eos> It's our list. Seeing how this place could have turned me around I figure you're responsible for everything bad I did, since the summer of 1982, and that's about 200 things.<eos> Good luck.<eos> - Stupid Carson Daly!<eos> Hands off snakey! - Time to get up and get started on your list.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> I chose the first one.<eos> "Took donuts from a banker, when I was not a customer." - I have to go now.?<eos> - Randy, people don't want their donuts in the afternoon.<eos> - Oh sure they would.
Hey, how about this for a change?<eos> How about in a cage match Encyclopedia Brown versus The Great Brain.<eos> To the death.<eos> Are you high?<eos> Am I high?<eos> No.<eos> No. Come on, man.<eos> I love when you go for the comedy.<eos> But I would not quit your day job beating up people.<eos> I wouldn't.
It's faster.<eos> Oh, right, because you know so much about driving inland.<eos> When was the last time your parent's $80,000 SUV was east of South Coast Plaza?<eos> The Cohens are my guardians, not my parents.<eos> I grew up in Chino.<eos> Dad's in prison, my mom... couldn't make it work.<eos> I just knew there was something about you that didn't quite fit in.<eos> In a good way.<eos> I wonder if your dad knows my Uncle Jack.<eos> Why would he?
And your First Sergeant found out about it.<eos> I don't know how, but he did.<eos> He yanked my leave and restricted me to base.<eos> And he went to the meeting in your place.<eos> He didn't go down there to kill anyone, sir.<eos> He went down there to make peace.<eos> To end it.<eos> He didn't want anyone else to get hurt.<eos> If I could, I'd switch places with him.<eos> I would.
Jimmy Cusack.<eos> Hate that guy.<eos> Wish he was dead.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - I do.<eos> I wish he was dead.<eos> What if something happened to him?<eos> You'd feel terrible.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.<eos> - Yeah, you would.
Wish he was dead.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - I do.<eos> I wish he was dead.<eos> What if something happened to him?<eos> You'd feel terrible.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.<eos> - Yeah, you would.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.<eos> - Yeah, you would.
It's an anniversary present for Nina.<eos> See, it's a diamond key to my heart.<eos> It's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.<eos> You can't tell me it looks like anything else, cos that's what it is.<eos> That's what I like.<eos> And I'm not gonna take it back.<eos> It's perfect, Angel.<eos> She'll love it.<eos> Really?<eos> I would.
Um,by serious, uh,you mean,we could,like,get fired?<eos> He means,Mr. Palmer, instead of attending medical school next month, you'll most likely be in prison.<eos> Oh.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Danger,intrigue,a damsel in distress.<eos> I'm actually looking forward to it.<eos> Me,too.<eos> Um... - I'm not exactly the type that would do well in prison,guys.<eos> -No one's going to think any less of you if you want out,Palmer. -Really?<eos> Well,no,they probably would.
I'm just asking the question.<eos> If you know a husband has been unfaithful, do you tell the wife?<eos> Absolutely. He could bring home a disease.<eos> That's how Bunny Conners got Chlamydia.<eos> [gasps] She said it was from wearing someone's bathing suit.<eos> No, that's how she got crabs.<eos> Poor Bunny, it's always something.<eos> If not the clap, it's a botched face lift.<eos> Be that as it may, do we all agree that I should tell this man's wife?<eos> I wouldn't.
Hands behind your back.<eos> You just fired this gun, sir?<eos> Damn.<eos> You okay, sir?<eos> Sir?<eos> NCIS Season 4 Episode 4: Faking It.<eos> Men are such bad liars.<eos> But if a good liar was telling you a lie, you would not know it was a lie.<eos> Ha!<eos> I would.
Always watching.<eos> DANNY: Jillian?<eos> Hi, Danny.<eos> Good news about Nessa, huh? Nessa?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Ed just told me that Nessa's in town and that she's with Delinda.<eos> Why would Ed tell you that?<eos> So, she's not in town?<eos> Danny, I would know if the daughter I haven't seen for two years was here.<eos> Yeah, of course you would.
Actually, we're cool.<eos> We just divided up CDs.<eos> It was all very civil.<eos> I'm proud of us;<eos> we're, we're good.<eos> Well, we were all going to go to Casa a Pezzi at 8:00.<eos> Lily, would you like to join us?<eos> What?<eos> Well, I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable.<eos> Why would it?
In "cone-clusion," here's the scoop:<eos> I love you.<eos> What the hell do you kids want? !<eos> Oh, right, ice cream.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's the opportunity of a lifetime.<eos> Attention, losers:<eos> this is your chance to buy your kids some frozen love.<eos> I'm not going to fall for such a cheap stunt.<eos> Mom would.
- I'll get it.<eos> You ran out of pills, Grandpa.<eos> - Shall I take you to have an injection?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> Hurry.<eos> It's a good thing I've already bought my shroud cloth.<eos> You wouldn't wrap me in three meters of rags.<eos> He is obsessed with three meters of rags!<eos> You wouldn't even do that.<eos> You wouldn't.
A shitload.<eos> Yeah.<eos> With your talent and my money I can make you a star.<eos> Hey, Jay.<eos> I saw you in the magazine.<eos> That was bitching.<eos> Jesus Christ, girl!<eos> Ain't you China's old lady?<eos> No, it's like he won't leave me alone.<eos> Well, I wouldn't either.
That's why our daddy doesn't wanna be with us.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Don't say that. That's not true.<eos> But we destroyed your Navigator.<eos> That?<eos> Oh, that's nothing.<eos> That's just a material object.<eos> It means nothing.<eos> I wouldn't wanna spend New Year's with us either.<eos> Who would?
Don't say that. That's not true.<eos> But we destroyed your Navigator.<eos> That?<eos> Oh, that's nothing.<eos> That's just a material object.<eos> It means nothing.<eos> I wouldn't wanna spend New Year's with us either.<eos> Who would?<eos> Me.<eos> I would.
Yeah, it's great.<eos> I'm so glad you finally decided to do it.<eos> I don't know. I just woke up today and it just felt like home.<eos> I'm gonna do all three walls.<eos> You know, I think it's time to take a break.<eos> - Wait a minute. - Whoo whoo whoo! I can't let it dry too much.<eos> Are we getting out of bed today, "Camille"?<eos> What for?<eos> I could die and nobody would care.<eos> I would.
Your so-called assassin is dead. Your head of security is making a deal.<eos> We have Lud and the rifle.<eos> You'll be tried before two courts.<eos> - He's been tried!<eos> - Sir, you're finished.<eos> - It doesn't matter!<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I told you I'd let him drown.<eos> The man who drove my wife into a bridge abutment.<eos> - But I wouldn't.
I heard about what happened this afternoon.<eos> Dog... Yeah.<eos> Yeah, your father is a very funny man.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I tried to warn you.<eos> So.. Where are you going?<eos> I was actually just looking for a place to eat.<eos> Oh, ok. there is only one place.<eos> You would like that I take you?<eos> Yes. Yes, I would.
- Take it at least, - I don't want it,<eos> - Come on, I am trying to correct things,<eos> - You can't! Do you hear me?<eos> You think you've figured something out?<eos> You run over here all pleased with yourself because you changed your mind?<eos> Now you're certain?<eos> Hal, you don't know anything,<eos> The book, the math, the dates, the writing, all that stuff you just decided with your buddies, it's just evidence,<eos> - It doesn't prove anything,<eos> - OK, what would?
Shit!<eos> - Who was just in here?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Somebody was just in here looking for this!<eos> - Lf it wasn't him it was you!<eos> - Why me?<eos> Because it wasn't one of the girls, was it?<eos> Put that down!<eos> - I wouldn't know what to do with it!<eos> - Well, he would!
Because that's my name, you ape.<eos> Goldie was my sister.<eos> My twin sister.<eos> I guess she was the nice one.<eos> Goldie and the other six - where are they?<eos> What did you do to them?<eos> You crazy goddamn broad.<eos> Just take a look at this mug.<eos> Would any of you dames let me get close enough to you to kill you?<eos> None of you would, but Goldie.
Towards them?<eos> There's nothing in the river.<eos> The river's empty.<eos> We wanna go back to England.<eos> Please, can we?<eos> - Where's Captain Newport?<eos> - There's nothing to eat.<eos> Captain Newport will be back shortly.<eos> Will he have food?<eos> He'd better.
- somewhat akin to the turkey baster.<eos> - Just up here.<eos> - And where did you two meet?<eos> - At my wedding.<eos> But it's such a short time.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> I knew after three seconds.<eos> I've heard of love happening that fast.<eos> The French call it le flash.<eos> They would, bloody perverts.
With 10 million euros?<eos> I'd start my own sports journal.<eos> "The Estrella."<eos> I've got it all planned.<eos> A real sports journal, modeled after the American tradition of sports journalism.<eos> You follow?<eos> With naked girls on the last page, like in the old days.<eos> With 10 million euros I'd rent 100 boats and bring all compatriots I could to Spain.<eos> The government wouldn't let you do that.<eos> Yes, it would.
Really, it's just a matter of inoculating people against it.<eos> If we're lucky, the zombie plague will end up a footnote in the history books. No worse than AIDS or bubonic plague.<eos> Yeah, if it's all the same to you, Nightingale I'd rather you not refer to Tom as a footnote.<eos> What's the bug up his ass?<eos> He lost his brother on a mission last week.<eos> Yeah, well, we all lose people.<eos> Yeah, but your people don't usually get back up and take a bite out of you after they die.<eos> Careful, you can infect yourself.<eos> You sure as hell wouldn't want that, would you?<eos> No, we wouldn't.
I have nine more years here.<eos> It's a long time, but since I served all those years inside... it's gonna be a lot easier out here.<eos> I'm getting rid of all those things... that I had, you know?<eos> Because of the space I have here.<eos> If it was inside, it's too many people together.<eos> I saw the front and the back.<eos> I wouldn't live there.<eos> I would've gone away.<eos> Would you like to come inside and see my room?<eos> - Yes, we would.
Although I admit to liking a fiery woman, you're a little on the bossy side.<eos> If you've got something private to say to me, you'd best get to it.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> All right.<eos> So, uh... Someone called my attorney saying I've made harassing phone calls, including one to a detective and that the police were looking for me and since I didn't want to end up, you know, dead,<eos> I thought I'd save you the trouble and turn myself in.<eos> What makes you think you'd end up dead?<eos> Flynn framed me for murder 3 years ago with deputy DA.<eos> Powell and Dr Easton, so clearly, I'd say, they'd feel better if I ceased to exist.<eos> Maybe I would, too.
I... I thought he was in Boston.<eos> There was also blood on the floor of your utility room.<eos> Do you have any explanation for that?<eos> Well, sometimes I cut my legs when I prune the roses.<eos> You prune your roses in winter?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.<eos> When do you prune yours?<eos> Mrs. Mays, I understand that you may want to do everything you can to protect your son but that little boy may be dying right now.<eos> I would like to help you.<eos> I really would.
Is it amazing you knows what he knows he's only 24?<eos> *******I'm about 50.<eos> Hope you like chocolate.<eos> Agent Hotchner?<eos> You having fun?<eos> Yes, definitely.<eos> I'm definitely having fun.<eos> Make a wish?<eos> Can I take this hat off?<eos> I wouldn't.
You'll get no argument here.<eos> Good!<eos> Three plus three would equal six.<eos> Well, I sometimes put nine to amuse myself.<eos> All right, take it up.<eos> Vigilant to detail like his pa.<eos> I'd think Mrs Garret, as the bank's chief backer... might wish to be present for its opening.<eos> - Well, as far as that, I got her proxy.<eos> - Yes, but wouldn't she wish to be?<eos> Perhaps she would.
- Guys...<eos> - Oh, come on, be honest.<eos> You didn't want any part of this until you found out that I was involved.<eos> That is so not true!<eos> Oh,yes, it is.<eos> It burns you that your own daughter picked me over you.<eos> She did not pick you.<eos> It just didn't occur to her that I would agree to do it.<eos> Well, now she knows, and if she had it to do over again,she'd pick me.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
That guy.<eos> What a mess.<eos> All melted of flesh, but even so, enough will to keep walking.<eos> Body ruined, but still desperate to live.<eos> And he's alive.<eos> Yeah, I wonder if I...<eos> If I were hurt like that...<eos> If you'd keep on walking?<eos> If anyone would know who I was.<eos> I would.
Yeah, sounds about right.<eos> Jake, I'm sorry about what I said.<eos> I was on a roll and it got out of hand.<eos> I don't think all that about you.<eos> Emotional withholding, false intimacy.<eos> So you've memorized it?<eos> I meant you're the guy who can't break up with somebody but that's because you're the kind of guy who doesn't wanna hurt anyone.<eos> Yeah, well, that has its downside too.<eos> Truth is right now, I figure I'm lucky you're even talking to me.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
No matter what she says, I ain't going nowhere.<eos> No fire. He lied.<eos> Maybe not. Maybe he really thinks they do go on fire.<eos> Come on, boys.<eos> Why can't we just stay with you?<eos> Well, because...<eos> We both love you and everything.<eos> You could be our mother.<eos> I would be proud to have you two as my sons.<eos> Any mother would.
Let's not ever take that for granted,ok?<eos> Deal.<eos> Even so,if something ever happened to me and you were alone,I would want you to be happy.<eos> No. I'd want you to find someone and find love again.<eos> I mean,wouldn't you want the same thing for me if something happened to you?<eos> --No. --No?<eos> !<eos> You wouldn't want me to be happy?<eos> Fine.<eos> Sure I would,ok?
-Wait.<eos> Who's Frank?<eos> -l had to get out here... and my car is at the dealer for its six-month service.<eos> My friend had a car and a driver standing by... so they let me borrow it and Frank... and that explains Frank.<eos> -You take your car to the dealer?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> They're such a rip-off.<eos> It says in the book to take it to the dealer.<eos> If it said to drive off a cliff, would you drive off a cliff?<eos> Yes, I would.
I'm counting two dozen Damocles-class missiles.<eos> That's LexCorp technology.<eos> [ALARMS WAILING] Battle stations, prepare for impact!<eos> WOMAN: Come on, let's get outta here!<eos> Ultimen, keep the League off of me.<eos> Sanitize the Watchtower.<eos> We've got business, Waller.<eos> You told me once that you were a patriot. Well, it's time to step up.<eos> You have to know that the Justice League would never have fired that weapon at you.<eos> Sure you would.
Why didn't you ever tell us?<eos> Mr. Monk, if you spent three minutes with them, you'd understand.<eos> I kept Mitch's name for a reason.<eos> I don't want any part of them or that.<eos> - So I guess you're kinda loaded, huh?<eos> - They are.<eos> They wouldn't offer me a nickel.<eos> I wouldn't take it if they did.<eos> This doesn't change anything, does it?<eos> No. / Well, why would it?
You have to promise me one thing.<eos> You won't tell the police.<eos> If you do they'll kill him.<eos> I don't know if I can promise you that.<eos> Do you have children?<eos> Yes, I have a son.<eos> Well, then you know how I feel.<eos> Wouldn't you do anything for him?<eos> Wouldn't you die for him?<eos> Yes, I would.
He won't kill Ducky.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because you couldn't live with the guilt?<eos> Maybe Ari knows that.<eos> Maybe that's his plan.<eos> Maybe the only way to save Ducky, Abby and McGee is to kill yourself.<eos> Special Agent McGee.<eos> Found Ducky and Gerald's cell phone in the park.<eos> Why would they leave their cell phones in the park?<eos> They wouldn't, McGee!
No. But the best in the world work for her.<eos> Hanna's CEO of Lowell Pharmaceuticals.<eos> McGee, I want a search warrant.<eos> On it, boss.<eos> Grab a change of clothes, meet me downstairs in five.<eos> Go to Bethesda, keep me updated on Tony's condition.<eos> Of course.<eos> Find out why Kate hasn't checked in. You got it.<eos> I got the phones, but they wouldn't trust me with a weapon.<eos> I wouldn't either, Jimmy.
You don't need a gimmick, Brooke.<eos> Just... tell me why you want to be president.<eos> I am who I am.<eos> No excuses.<eos> But I'd like people to know there's a lot more to me than just some party girl.<eos> This is from a speech by John F. Kennedy.<eos> -I think it could work for you.<eos> -This is all about courage.<eos> Nobody's gonna believe this coming from me.<eos> I would.
With the god's help, I can destroy him.<eos> Please don't talk this way.<eos> Would you rather I lied to you?<eos> I would rather that you think of something other than the destruction of my uncle.<eos> I have never lied to you.<eos> He still has some terrible hold over me.<eos> I wish it were not so, but he will not let go.<eos> Will you ask your brother?<eos> Would that make you happy?<eos> Yes, it would.
Coming right up!<eos> How fab is she? !<eos> I can't believe it's not butter!<eos> They were my life, you bastard!<eos> Just tell us where the kiddies were when you last saw 'em.<eos> There!<eos> And you went back to bed?<eos> Only for an hour.<eos> Leave the kids here for an hour?<eos> Would you?
Thanks.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> Oh, just got off the phone with the general.<eos> Oh, that was all the screaming I heard from the house.<eos> Yeah, well apparently he is very disappointed in me for letting this happen, and as far as the family chain of command goes, I am the weakest link.<eos> - I'm sorry. - Don't be.<eos> You know, there's something cathartic about telling a 3-star general to go to hell.<eos> You know, all these years I thought I had my sister pegged but... in reality, she's a complete stranger to me.<eos> Even if that were true, I think that if she called you tomorrow, you'd be there in the second to help her.<eos> Yeah I would.
Jacob Carter.<eos> Dad this is Pete.<eos> Dad?<eos> Not quite yet. You have to actually marry my daughter, before you can call me that.<eos> I was just... I meant... stammer, stammer.<eos> It's an honour to meet you sir.<eos> Really?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I didn't want you to be nervous.<eos> Why would I?
I'll help you stay alive as long as possible, but no, I am not helping you with this plan.<eos> So my own hallucination is saying no to me?<eos> You must realize subconsciously that you need to be talked out of this.<eos> I can't even hallucinate right today.<eos> Alright.<eos> We're above the search coordinates.<eos> Okay. It should transition seamlessly.<eos> Alright, then.<eos> Here goes nothing.<eos> I... I wouldn't.
- Listen... - What?<eos> - Come back to class.<eos> - No.<eos> You could take over as Bobbie's partner in the Latin dances.<eos> You've got those knocked already.<eos> There's no way I could learn 'em in time.<eos> I'm not comin' back as the Bobbinator's partner.<eos> We'll look like an olive and a toothpick together.<eos> Besides. she would never dance with me.<eos> Sure she would.

We checked your story, and you're free to go.<eos> -Excuse me, Mr. Wolff?<eos> -Mm-hmm.<eos> Can I have your autograph?<eos> Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> Sure.<eos> To Sergeant Rose.<eos> Stu Wolff.<eos> Right, well, now that that's settled, would anyone like to come to a party with me?<eos> I would.
You won't find any of my divisional commanders playing silly buggers with Jerry concealed.<eos> How many landing craft lost?<eos> First estimates are at 11, possibly 12.<eos> But we've only seen two or three hulls.<eos> Any intercepted Jerry signals?<eos> E-boat captains radioed Berlin, claiming two dozen.<eos> We went on the air with a decodable signal to Patton's fictitious army saying it lost five landing craft.<eos> First reports back from Signal Corps indicate Jerry bought the whole program.<eos> I'd be surprised if Jerry's really buying the idea that the bulk of our forces are in the east.<eos> I wouldn't.
I didn't know he was a teenager.<eos> He looked, old enough!<eos> What bullshit!<eos> You liked it!<eos> You made me look this old!<eos> I lost all my energy because of you!<eos> You little brat!<eos> There are so many young and cute girls out there!<eos> Did your dick work for her?<eos> Mine would.
We've taken over buildings on either side.<eos> We've got snipers on the roof ready to go.<eos> - Phones?<eos> - We didn't jam the area.<eos> You said he'd know.<eos> - What about infrared?<eos> - We can't get through the walls, Jack.<eos> - He knows we're here.<eos> - What makes you say that?<eos> - Cos I would.
He's not my son.<eos> What do you mean, he's not your son?<eos> His mother slapped me with a paternity suit.<eos> I settled.<eos> She came back about 10 years later... with a guilty conscience and admitted that I wasn't the father... just deep pockets.<eos> But I liked the kid... so I kept paying for his education and so forth.<eos> Obviously, he doesn't know.<eos> His mother said it would break his heart.<eos> He so liked being... the son of Denny Crane.<eos> Hmm. Who wouldn't?
Hey, how's Bobby doing?<eos> Shaken, but working hard. Trying to figure out why the gun discharged.<eos> Well, fortunately, Bobby dodged his bullet... unlike our victim.<eos> C.O.D's a single gunshot wound to the leg.<eos> And it severed the femoral artery.<eos> We processed the guy's jeans.<eos> Tight GSR pattern around the entrance hole.<eos> So, he was either shot by someone at close range who left the gun behind, or it was self-inflicted.<eos> Why would the shooter leave the gun behind?<eos> He probably wouldn't.
It was more his speed.<eos> You're busy.<eos> Am I gonna see you tonight?<eos> - I'm working late.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> Duct tape.<eos> So the shooter stuck the gun in the toilet earlier to avoid the metal detector.<eos> Echoes of Michael Corleone.<eos> So if Manny is the shooter, why would he need to hide his own gun?<eos> He wouldn't.
No, he's standing by the valet...<eos> "Get my car, boy." I saw it, Larry.<eos> He had on a white shirt and a red tie and a vest. He's standing by the valet sign.<eos> It's an honest mistake.<eos> Oh, yeah yeah, that's honest.<eos> Anytime I see a black man in a tie and a suit, I think, "Hey, you must park cars for a living."<eos> I feel it was an honest mistake, Wanda.<eos> No no, if it was a white man standing here, you would not.<eos> I would have given him the valet.<eos> I would too. - No, you wouldn't.
No ice, thank you.<eos> - What were you doing in Hong Kong?<eos> - Making money... seeing which way the wind would blow once the Chinese took it back.<eos> - Which way is it blowing?<eos> - Back to London.<eos> What about you?<eos> What do you do, apart from panic in lifts?<eos> - You don't know who I am?<eos> - Should I?<eos> Every other person in here would.
Come on, you know how this works. They won't dare say no to us.<eos> Captain, it's not just your best shot.<eos> It's your only shot.<eos> And few there be that find it.<eos> Praise the lord.<eos> A cleansing is coming.<eos> There will be a reckoning.<eos> A cleansing is coming.<eos> Who would like to see a cleansing?<eos> I would, I would.
My shots are dispensed by a machine to prevent any free drinks, and I have internal controls to insure that all cash is accounted for.<eos> What's the deal with your hair?<eos> How do you think a guy from Lexington Park ends up an hour away at a party in Alexandria?<eos> It's easy.<eos> It's a Darin Spotnitz party.<eos> Put a name brand on it, you know it's a name brand.<eos> I mean, no one ever thought to put a brand name on a party till I did it.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> I should take this.<eos> - I wouldn't.
- Is this a good time?<eos> It's always a good time for you, sir.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Let me get you a chair.<eos> General.<eos> At ease, Major, please.<eos> There you go, sir.<eos> I'm glad to find you all here.<eos> You wouldn't happen to have another one of those?<eos> I would.
I'm Donna Moss.<eos> -The press conference was a hit.<eos> -The president did well.<eos> Ranting on cable about "that liberal pantywaist soft on crime"?<eos> What we expected.<eos> Extra gum for your big night.<eos> -Guess this makes it official.<eos> -You do your family proud.<eos> Shouldn't I just stick my head in and say hello?<eos> -I wouldn't.
Make it like what he was doing led to your thing?<eos> I don't see it.<eos> Well, it's good work nonetheless, Major Daniels.<eos> Call came in from the Mayor's office half-hour ago approving your promotion.<eos> And now with Colvin, there's a new vacancy.<eos> What about my wife?<eos> What about her?<eos> The Mayor.<eos> Eunetta's seat.<eos> Why would the Mayor...
No.<eos> Tell me. Well, when he was very young, he was very handsome and an excellent skater.<eos> And she was the new girl in town, barely able to skate.<eos> She was very, very innocent.<eos> Very beautiful.<eos> Of course.<eos> And he was already engaged, but he couldn't stop watching my mother.<eos> This is my song.<eos> And finally his fiancée got very jealous and--<eos> I would too.
-There's a price on your head.<eos> I'm going to collect.<eos> Why don't you just tell Barillo everything you know.<eos> And then maybe he'll just cut off your hands.<eos> And if I don't?<eos> You know that old man I killed in your village?<eos> What if your whole village was next?<eos> Would you kill them?<eos> Me?<eos> They certainly would.
No matter what they do, the doctors can't find the reason... why I'm unable to conceive.<eos> What does Muad'dib say?<eos> Muad'dib is afraid.<eos> He fears for me if I have another child.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> He may be right to fear.<eos> Someone has been feeding you a poison.<eos> It's the only possibility left.<eos> But the doctors have never found evidence.<eos> They wouldn't.
He lets me be myself.<eos> I've never been happier, honey.<eos> One, two, three, draw!<eos> I think she got you!<eos> I've just never been happier.<eos> Who do you have to know... to get a little Grey Poupon around here?<eos> Ray!<eos> It's you, in my apartment, making a sandwich.<eos> It wouldn't kill you to keep lettuce in the crisper.<eos> No, it wouldn't, Ray.
The Baywatch?<eos> -Yeah, the Baywatch.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Can I go?<eos> -You wanna go now?<eos> -To the Baywatch.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm going there.<eos> I was on my way.<eos> -Yes, I would.
Even white boys got to shout<eos> Baby got back!<eos> Baby got back!<eos> That's an old-school song.<eos> You're old-school, too, Larry.<eos> We got an item that we want to package ourselves and, you know....<eos> -Mail out.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Could we just get an envelope from you?<eos> What size would you Iike?
I prefer it to the real thing.<eos> Last night, I was home by myself and I conjured up a threesome with me, Marilyn Monroe and Sophia Loren.<eos> It was very erotic.<eos> In fact, if I'm not mistaken, it was the first time those two great actresses ever appeared in anything together.<eos> - It sounds nice, but...<eos> - The only reason I ask is because I think that as you go through life, you learn to depend only on yourself.<eos> You know? Do you own a firearm?<eos> A gun?<eos> A gun qualifies as a firearm, yes.<eos> - No. Why would I?
The bunion... What?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Listen to you.<eos> You're Mr. Medical Authority.<eos> I asked you on the phone not to come here.<eos> I don't want to see you again.<eos> I just wanted to apologize and make sure that you don't have any problem with me that would interfere with the wedding.<eos> - There's not gonna be a wedding.<eos> - Would you like us to step outside, sir?<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
You heartless fuck.<eos> I thought--<eos> Bastard!<eos> I thought he was your friend.<eos> Who do you think you are?<eos> Who the fuck do you think you are?<eos> You're nobody!<eos> I could make you disappear like that... and not one fucking person would miss you.<eos> Not one fucking person!<eos> - Bernie would!
I don't think so.<eos> Ah fuck...<eos> Captain, was this all the work of Valdon? Si.<eos> It was terrible.<eos> Valdon kidnapped Mr. Rhodes and Father Perez.<eos> In our attempt to free them Mr. Rhodes and... the priest got shot and killed by the drug dealers.<eos> Three of my men are also dead and a forth badly wounded.<eos> We got three of Valdon's men, the rest got away.<eos> I think Chief Fuentes would like to make a statement.<eos> No, but Detective Castillo would.
Let's go.<eos> PATRICK: Come on.<eos> Guys. Let's go upstairs.<eos> PATRICK. We'll get the stand up there for Polly.<eos> Oh. My. How you've grown.<eos> PATRICK. I hope you're gonna be comfortable.<eos> Mom. HRAM. Am I in Josh's room?<eos> PATRICK. Hey. Buddy.<eos> DOUG: That kid and his dog will show up here.<eos> What kid wouldn't?
disable her if you can, destroy her if you must, but god forgive you if you're wrong, because i won't.<eos> it's a little late for sentimentality, don't you think?<eos> captain hunt.<eos> i imagine you've left me no troops to call?<eos> i had excellent training.<eos> your ship is outmatched.<eos> if your people refuse to stand down, you have ordered them to their deaths.<eos> maybe, but sooner or later, a swarm of very angry genites are going to come out of slipstream, and they're going to kill whichever one of us is left.<eos> yeah, but i can't believe that you would allow this facility to fall back into the hands of the genites.<eos> i wouldn't.
- Oh, hi. Yeah, everything's going great here.<eos> Yeah, so maybe I'll see you later then, Mom?<eos> Look, we have to talk.<eos> Talking to your mother... now you sound like Mickey.<eos> Are you the new Mickey, John Smith?<eos> - The new Mickey?<eos> - Yeah, Mickey... used to look out for me now and then for Cathan.<eos> Maybe that's why Cathan put you in the car.<eos> No, he didn't mention it.<eos> Well he wouldn't.
It's happening already.<eos> I spoke with MacReady.<eos> He agrees that, in light of recent events... some of your laws might be a little outdated.<eos> Before people could travel through space to other planets... they had to get off the ground first.<eos> Almost 40 years after my human ancestors left Earth... two brothers from Ohio became the first human beings... to build a successful flying machine.<eos> Their names were Orville and Wilbur Wright.<eos> Would anyone like to see a picture of their aeroplane?<eos> - Me.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> You all would.
So what do we do?<eos> I'm crushing your head.<eos> Let's go.<eos> A perfectly restorable sun porch wraps around the entire main structure.<eos> Let's step inside this diamond in the rough.<eos> Unbelievable, shocking, working at an inn and learning so little.<eos> We must be dumb.<eos> Who would ever think that inns need doors and floors?<eos> - Doors and floors, we can't afford that.<eos> - We'd better...
