Tra la la la la la!<eos> I love another, and I'll die saying so!<eos> So that's your tune, is it?<eos> There were knife wounds, and she's the one who inflicted them.<eos> Well, you have a ready hand!<eos> Find a rope.<eos> Here, take this rope and tie up those pretty hands.<eos> It's really a pity because she's a nice girl.<eos> But however nice you are a little spell in jail won't do you any harm.<eos> You can sing your gypsy songs in there and the jailer will tell you what he thinks of them.
They're just bitter songs.<eos> Uncle, do you sing?<eos> I'm not happy and not sad.<eos> Why should I sing now?<eos> There are so many songs.<eos> How can you remember them all?<eos> When life becomes hard, you remember.<eos> Why do you collect bitter songs?<eos> To put new words to them.<eos> Soldiers of Cuiqiao's age will sing them wherever they go.
This news will make you sad.<eos> Betrothed at thirteen.<eos> Married at fourteen.<eos> Widowed at fifteen.<eos> She cried so loudly, all could hear.<eos> She wept, then killed herself.<eos> Hanhan, go back.<eos> I won't leave. Let's go back.<eos> Take me with you.<eos> I packed my things, but i didn't bring them; it'll be easier without them.
We're fine, but look...<eos> They're taking everything in sight!<eos> Don't worry, I will slip away and return when I can.<eos> We must prevent that monster's resurrection while I'm gone!<eos> Yes.<eos> Nausicaa?<eos> Teto, where has she gone too?<eos> Nausicaa! What on earth is this?<eos> These plants are gathered from the Sea of Decay.<eos> I've grown them from spores I collected.
Where do they get this crap?<eos> Do you see that guy across the gate? The little guy?<eos> Could we not all look at once, please?<eos> I have it on reliable sources that that's Hugh Elder.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> He's disguised, but I got suspicious about him. You know what I mean?<eos> - How does he get copy out?<eos> - How does he get his copy out?<eos> With specially trained hens.<eos> The BBC has, like, commissioned them to walk past the Khmer Rouge like their regular fowl.
Trotsky was right.<eos> They have dumped shit on the revolution from head to toe.<eos> You'll land us all in prison.<eos> They're not looking for you.<eos> You're not a dissident.<eos> You're not Sakharov or Shcharansky.<eos> Our leaders are only good for parades.<eos> And they don't have any balls.<eos> I've never seen the balls of our leaders.<eos> Oh, you'll see them. In the next revolution.
Gently rocking.<eos> Gently rocking.<eos> Gently rocking.<eos> BROOKLYN 9 KNIGHTS 1<eos> I'm sending you down, Hobbs.<eos> Class B ball.<eos> Tomorrow morning, you go to the Great Lakes Association.<eos> - You make the rules.<eos> - That's right.<eos> And you ain't been playing by them.

These hands that are gonna break every bone in your body.<eos> Later.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Where is the stone?<eos> - I don't...<eos> We dug. We didn't find anything.<eos> Crocodiles shed tears when they eat their prey.<eos> You have heard of these tears, I am sure.<eos> But have you seen them?
- Great. I love a girl with class.<eos> - This is great.<eos> - You want to help change this tyre?<eos> Changing flat tyres isn't exactly my line of work, dear.<eos> If that's the case, then why don't you shut up?<eos> I wish I could write songs.<eos> I just can't figure out how to do it right, like you do it.<eos> I can't figure out how you work out the rhymes and the melodies.<eos> Somebody else writes the songs.<eos> Billy buys or steals them.
May I phone?<eos> You shouldn't let him sleep like that after lunch.<eos> They'll kill you.<eos> Irene; Really!<eos> OPERA 34.16...<eos> You're sure?<eos> No; Thank you.<eos> Your house?<eos> Irene saw that the child would die young at fifteen, or perhaps earlier.<eos> So she folded her hands and held them inside her own.
Esteemed Doksopulo!<eos> The Church of the Mother of God is one of the greatest monuments of early Christianity.<eos> A cultural monument!<eos> Demolishing it means cutting off the life-giving roots that nourish and spiritually enrich our people.<eos> Then throw into fire the works of Rustaveli and Dante!<eos> Stop playing Bach, Beethoven, Verdi!<eos> Let's demolish the St. Peter Church, Notre Dame, Svetitskhoveli...<eos> Esteemed Varlam!<eos> Our church used to have some unique relics.<eos> Through centuries our ancestors had protected them up to this day.
I'm certain of it.<eos> I knew it.<eos> There was something the matter with Paul that made him go away. I felt it.<eos> Our hens are so happy, they've laid three eggs.<eos> One for Anton, one for Ernst and one for Granny.<eos> Let's go indoors and I'll make Easter eggs, all yellow.<eos> But, Granny, it's not Easter.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You never know what will happen.<eos> We'll put them in the water and they'll go yellow.
Let us hope not.<eos> Well, you know where she goes.<eos> The post office.<eos> Oh, how do you know? Tongues wag.<eos> Especially that old postmistress.<eos> Oh, her. Well, she says anything.<eos> Well, nigh every afternoon this week into the post office comes Miss Eyre to see if there's a letter for "J.E."<eos> And when she finds there's none, she marches out with a face like a funeral.<eos> I believe it is your turn to take the girls' study hour this evening.<eos> Yes, Miss Watts, and then I read prayers to them and see them to bed.
I do not understand that.<eos> You've got like no house nor no brass, I guess.<eos> It does not make me a beggar.<eos> Are you book-learnt? Yes.<eos> I was at a boarding school for 8 years.<eos> Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?<eos> I have done so and I hope I will again in the future.<eos> What are you going to do with those apples?<eos> Make them into pies.<eos> Give them to me and I'll peel them for you.
Remember, Yvon, we parted without ever having fought.<eos> When I come home, I'll work as hard as I can.<eos> The three of us will start a new life together.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Stay!<eos> Don't stay there!<eos> - Okay?<eos> - No, but I have the card and code.<eos> I saw it clearly: 3876.<eos> But if I leave the two blades there, they'll spot them and we won't be able to carry on.
Yeah, beautiful personality too.<eos> Say, you want to meet him? Come on...<eos> I see you got the drift, ah?<eos> Here...<eos> Atta boy. Good, huh?<eos> You know, I've told you a million, billion, trillion times, don't do that, you son-of-a-bitch.<eos> Ooh, you know how it makes me break out in a rash.<eos> Now I know where I've seen them... er you!<eos> What's your friend allergic to, anyway?<eos> I thought I was seeing things and now I'm seeing them again.
- That's Largo's lady.<eos> - Her name is Domino.<eos> Domino Petachi.<eos> Petachi.<eos> The air-force officer killed in that car crash.<eos> - Jack Petachi.<eos> - That's right.<eos> He was her brother.<eos> Well, there's the man himself.<eos> If he's got the bombs, do you think he'd have them on his yacht?
I designed it myself.<eos> But my problem is, I've never yet found a worthy adversary.<eos> No doubt I shall disappoint you too.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Darling?<eos> This game has one objective: power.<eos> We will be fighting for countries, chosen at random by the machine.<eos> But for this demonstration I will choose France.<eos> Target areas will light up on the map.<eos> Whoever hits them first with his laser beam will score points.
When they all come out they all look scared.<eos> Buenos dias, Gonzalez.<eos> Buenos dias yourself.<eos> Would you come this way.<eos> That guy didn't fool me a bit.<eos> That Mexican guy?<eos> That guy's Navy all the way. There's another swabbo.<eos> I'll open the box a little so you can see.<eos> Don't put your fingers in there.<eos> This thing will bite them off.
"Come in, Carmen!"<eos> "Do you think my room is pretty?"<eos> Yes, Ma'am.<eos> "I seem to recall you like the ladies."<eos> Just stories, Ma'am.<eos> "Then... it's not true?"<eos> "You don't like women?"<eos> I didn't say that, Ma'am.<eos> "But you know you're seductive,"<eos> and you appeal to them."
Surprise!<eos> - Now you're mad at me.<eos> - I'm not mad at you.<eos> You've been under pressure.<eos> I know that pressure can make people do crazy and impulsive things.<eos> No, I bought these things for us.<eos> For you too.<eos> What if someone broke in?<eos> What will you do? Stun him with good taste?<eos> I bought them because there's a need.
Now.<eos> Get out of here, old man!<eos> Take that hippie girl!<eos> Know what's wrong with you?<eos> You're meek.<eos> They'll inherit the earth! To the depth of six feet!<eos> I'm going to blow his mind!<eos> He's going to be bloody!<eos> He'll be a steaming hunk of goo!<eos> I'll tear his ears off and hang them in my car like furry dice!
I thought so!<eos> - - And you have a wife?<eos> Bride? Wife? -<eos> - I do.<eos> Ah ...<eos> I thought so!<eos> - - I have two.<eos> - - What?<eos> - - Two women.<eos> If you want to present them. -
Now, you and this, uh... cesspool you call a television station... and, uh, your people who wallow around in it... and, uh, your viewers... who watch you do it...<eos> You're rotting us away from the inside.<eos> We intend to stop that rot.<eos> We're gonna start with Channel 83, Max.<eos> We're gonna use it for our first authentic transmissions of Videodrome.<eos> I have a hunch it's gonna be very popular... for a while.<eos> I've gotta be hallucinating now, right?<eos> I mean... you two can't possibly be for real.<eos> Ah, we did record your hallucinations, Max... as I said we would.<eos> And we did analyze them.
I don't want to disturb you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Please excuse me.<eos> I've come about the fables.<eos> You should see the director.<eos> Comrade kuparadze gave him a call.<eos> I've been waiting for comrade director for two days now.<eos> Excuse me...<eos> You think he'll accept my fables?<eos> I don't, but he may not turn them down.
No, but I've got half a copy, and khabuzania took a part of that half.<eos> I tried to read it, but I couldn't.<eos> Take a look.<eos> It seems to be the last copy.<eos> You think one can make it out?<eos> It's rather difficult. I'll try to put together a full copy for you.<eos> That would be nice.<eos> - l've already got the first 20 pages.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> Boris will give them to kote, he promised to read them by tomorrow.

All right.<eos> Look here.<eos> Am I being too familiar with you?<eos> We've been familiar for a long time.<eos> Then rewrite it starting from this page to page 52.<eos> Got it.<eos> Fine, this will not do any more.<eos> Neither will this.<eos> This goes to the wastebasket, too.<eos> These violets. I brought them for you.
And then, if it suits us, at cards.<eos> Seven What is the bet? The one who wins loses, right?<eos> SCENE XIV IN SUBURRA, ROAD, TAVERN, BORDELLO.<eos> INTERIOR, EXTERIOR, NIGHT.<eos> Again in detail, the dice thrown by Clodia at the end of the previous scene now fall on the table of a Suburra tavern, in ancient Rome.<eos> Thrown by the hand of a player.<eos> Around the two men playing, are 5 spectators.<eos> In a corner, a drunken man is trying not to fall asleep and slurs unintelligible sentences.<eos> An old pedlar enters to sell his chickpea cakes.<eos> He offers them to two strangers seated silently at another table.
She offers her throat to Ade's wind that starts suddenly to blow.<eos> Her long turquoise tunic floats like the lightest sail.<eos> Clodia's gaze is increasingly smooth, always flexible to the soft and unvarying flow of the scene.<eos> And now, from the opening, where Fenissa ventured, Sestilio appears, wakened from his deathly sleep.<eos> His body has volume and weight, and ruptures, advancing, the screen of the spider's web.<eos> He comes to Septima.<eos> Kneels down at her side.<eos> Finally, the enchantress can place her painted lips on the lifeless mouth in such way that reanimates.<eos> Sestilio has his hands bound by bandages.<eos> However, he raises and moves them toward Septima's hips and then onto her breast, recovering the frustrated memory of caresses.
The hand movement, with which she returns the glass, has an exhaustion and a perfection that are outside of life.<eos> The chamberlain's gaze instigates her to contemplate once more the characters inhabiting that place.<eos> Clodia can feel their incessant vibrating, their unconsummated and perfect simulation.<eos> The man nods to Clodia towards the doorway where they entered.<eos> Eerily, there's no more trace of the spider's web.<eos> Clodia moves along with him who says to her:<eos> "There are two opposite streets that rejoin each other under the arch of a door where is written<eos> "The instant."<eos> These two opposite streets are in fact only one.<eos> An eternity separates them.
You can always find me there."<eos> Clodia's voice is the one directed, mysteriously toward the solution.<eos> Saying this, she turns her gaze on her sister... who, this time, says nothing.<eos> She finds or searches no more for a defined thought within the short regular time limit.<eos> The guest's voice convicts her.<eos> "Eliminated."<eos> For the first time, the scene widens gathering together the three actors.<eos> A linear panoramic accompanies the other Clodia to the bed where she sits.<eos> The challenge continues with two.<eos> The figures return to isolation, each in their own ambiguous steadiness, available to the fake tortures imposed on them by the sadistic swinging of the image that holds them.
She speaks the truth.<eos> The kid speaks the truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> The mother of these girls has legal custody.<eos> That man does not have legal custody over these two little girls.<eos> - Can you follow my message?<eos> Come on, Ivan.<eos> You know as well as I do that bitch has no rights.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Gloria Travalian, the mother of these girls among others, who is also my wife has legal custody over these girls. I won't give them to that man there who does not have legal custody.
For Drawing Number 2.<eos> From 9 o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock the lower lawns of the house including the formal garden will be kept clear.<eos> No window in the upper part of the house will be opened closed or otherwise disturbed.<eos> Your Mr. Neville, Sarah has the God-like power of emptying the landscape.<eos> It is a wonder the birds still sing.<eos> If they stopped I doubt whether Mr. Neville would appreciate the difference.<eos> His attitude to nature is strictly material.<eos> Thomas why is Mr. Neville interested in my sheets?<eos> He is to draw them wet outside the laundry.<eos> Wet? Why does he want them wet?
If you have any influence over your son-in-law I suggest that he travel over to Mr. Seymour's to see what can be done with limes by doing as little as possible.<eos> Limes, Madam can smell so sweet. Especially when they are allowed to bloom without hindrance. And it will shortly be time to bloom.<eos> Is it true that you would wish to see Mr. Herbert dead?<eos> I've no great love for Mr. Herbert. Goodness, a provocative question.<eos> Then why stay?<eos> Mr. Noyes has a great attachment to my mother, Mr. Neville.<eos> I'm employed by Mr. Herbert as Estate Manager. Mr. Herbert is often away and I can make myself useful to Mrs. Herbert.<eos> In more ways than one I presume. But is it not that way which is most important?<eos> Your questions are far too imprudent and provocative in this company.<eos> Then you'd rather I asked them behind your back?
Natalia and I don't have to report until 2:30, but you must go by 1:00.<eos> Here are the coordinates that you must feed into the inertial navigator.<eos> They'll put you in contact with a commercial flight from Moscow.<eos> As soon as they've seen you and it appears that you're flying south feed in the second set.<eos> - What happens if I'm late?<eos> - You won't be, if we time it correctly.<eos> You'll head east through the Urals.<eos> Be very cautious of your speed during this phase.<eos> There are listening installations.<eos> "Big ears" we call them.
The building was practically in the jungle.<eos> Prices are ten times higher here than in New York. There are palaces being built with tiles from Delft and Florentine marble.<eos> And Iquitos is catching up.<eos> It's still a filthy frontier town but the rubber business is growing by leaps and bounds.<eos> The better-off citizens in Manaus, if I may put it like that send their laundry to Lisbon because the water in the Amazon is felt to be impure.<eos> Aren't you going to stay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't mind you're running a brothel. But there are too many of your clients around. Come on.<eos> I train the girls for the best households.<eos> Much better than sending them out on the streets.
Wonderful, gentlemen.<eos> Quite spectacular.<eos> Here's to the reconciliation of the evil spirits of the Pongo.<eos> I'll tell you a story.<eos> At the time when North America was hardly explored one of those early French trappers went westward from Montreal and he was the first white man to set eyes on Niagara Falls.<eos> When he returned, he told of waterfalls that were more vast and immense than people had ever dreamed of.<eos> But no one believed him. They thought he was a madman or a liar.<eos> They asked him, "What's your proof?"<eos> And he answered...<eos> "My proof is that I have seen them."
Hello?<eos> Yes, it's me.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm coming.<eos> There he comes.<eos> Attention.<eos> Gerber.<eos> You've made a fool out of me.<eos> You get to train four girls and you let them be kidnapped.
I didn't come to see the show.<eos> I came to see how they make the rosetta bread.<eos> I've heard them say you're a rotten intellectual.<eos> With whom it is impossible to argue.<eos> I'm not an intellectual, nor am I rotten, that's insane.<eos> They have both told me, therefore it must be true.<eos> I heard nothing about you.<eos> Ah yes, someone said you you were sexy.<eos> Only that?<eos> Well, they said many other things, but I don't know about them.
Calm down.<eos> C'mon, take a walk.<eos> Billy, please get into the house so we can talk like men.<eos> I understand you, but you should also understand me.<eos> I pay these two who are digging.<eos> I pay two graveyard guards.<eos> I pay people who inform me.<eos> Everybody ask, I just pay.<eos> Where from?<eos> 20 years I work for your company, I dig the coffins out, you just clean them from the mud, lacquer them and sell them as new.
- Beth, get him to talk to me.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Shall we sit down?<eos> Is there any news?<eos> We backtracked over all our militay leads so far.<eos> They still deny knowledge of his arrest.<eos> We had a fingerprint check made at all the morgues.<eos> Came up negative.<eos> - Do you trust your sources?<eos> - Captain Tower checked them.
It burns and it stinks.<eos> But you must use it, because she has a good nose.<eos> Shoes!<eos> Put your shoes here.<eos> Please don't take them.<eos> They were a gift from my father.<eos> My God, how'd you keep them in the camp?<eos> I hid them.<eos> Please ....<eos> If she sees them, she'll take them away.
Get back! Get back!<eos> Get your ass over here!<eos> Burn it.<eos> Damn it, Childs.<eos> Torch it!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh!<eos> Look.<eos> Son of a bitch. Oh.<eos> You see, what we're talking about here is an organism that imitates other life-forms, and it imitates them perfectly.
Is it true that Japanese men beat their wives?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Everyone says so.<eos> Not true!<eos> I want to use the toilet.<eos> Low water-pressure.<eos> Must flush twice.<eos> Okay!<eos> Why are there beer-cans in the tank?<eos> The waiter hid them there.
-What?<eos> You have to eat something. No, really.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> You put me in an awkward position, Mr Kessler.<eos> How'd I do that?<eos> You're to take these after you've eaten.<eos> What sort of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as handing out pills?<eos> -Leave the pills.<eos> I'll take them later.
She took one of the canoes back to the main camp, but where are the other five?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe the kids are just pulling a prank.<eos> Marnie!<eos> Get all the kids together to where the canoes were moored.<eos> Okay!<eos> Okay, okay. Quiet, quiet.<eos> I'm not kidding now.<eos> Does anyone know what happened to the canoes?<eos> Oh, yeah, Dave sold them to some Indian guy.
No, I mean it. You can push guts, bully them, but you can hone nerves.<eos> Paddock, Scholz and Eric Liddell.<eos> Come here a minute, Mr Abrahams.<eos> Now, do you know why you lost the other day?<eos> Because you're overstriding.<eos> Just a couple of inches.<eos> Now...<eos> These coins represent the strides in your hundred meters.<eos> Have you got another _o coins, Mr Abrahams?<eos> Well, maybe we can find them.
Do you remember what Dr. Silverman said about going into analysis?<eos> We can't afford it.<eos> But it's so much more important than the money.<eos> And I was thinking that if I saved on some things, then...<eos> If you think I'm gonna pay some parasite $100 an hour to listen to me rattle on about my experiences in my mother's womb, you're crazy.<eos> After $1,000, he'll probably tell me I have a penis complex because I lost my hand, and after $10,000, he'll probably tell me I'm sane again.<eos> No doubt we're all crazy in some ways, believe me, but that doesn't mean we have to go parading out our psychosis to some other psychotic just because he has a white coat and a degree, does it?<eos> Those bastards.<eos> They just love to prey on our insecurities.<eos> And if we didn't have them, they'd create them.
- Okay.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Trauma. A shock of some kind might cause it.<eos> A hockey player gets cracked in the head, goes to the locker room, showers, changes, eats, finds himself driving home. He can't even remember who won the game.<eos> - What sort of trauma?<eos> - A thing like that might start it.<eos> What have you been doing during these black outs?<eos> Misplacing things.<eos> Finding them again.
You haven't seen him, have you?<eos> He kills chickens.<eos> Well, I don't keep chickens in the shower.<eos> - This is pretty.<eos> - Please don't touch them.<eos> Put them back on the shelf.<eos> Snippy.<eos> Your left ball in the corner pocket.<eos> Sorry, Earl.<eos> I started collecting them when I was 9 years old.
I like it.<eos> Or how about this one?<eos> I don't know what the difference is.<eos> I mean, with Carl around, it's not going to stay on too long anyway, right?<eos> Yeah. He is a real animal.<eos> Any of you Pritcher girls got any rolling papers?<eos> Uh, I think I do.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> I'll roll you a couple for later.<eos> Carl gave them to me.
- Who is this boy?<eos> He's the ranking cadet. Moreland.<eos> Do you have any explanation for this?<eos> My God.<eos> Where are all the weapons?<eos> - The weapons are secured, sir.<eos> - What do you mean secured?<eos> - You mean you stole them?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> We confiscated them.
The papers are in a safe.<eos> The safe is in the study.<eos> The study adjoins the bedroom.<eos> Just like any staunch scoundrel, Milverton sleeps soundly.<eos> Agatha confirmed that.<eos> All goes according to schedule.<eos> It's half past ten.<eos> - It's time to put on the masks.<eos> - No.<eos> We'll put them on when we climb over the wall.
Do it, or your first day will be your last.<eos> Understand?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Clean this mess up and get to work.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Dick?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I just dropped by to give you these papers.<eos> They're the last.<eos> You sign them, and then you give them to your lawyer.
I'm in an exciting mood.<eos> - You're in the mood, huh?<eos> - Yeah. - All right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Where? Tonight I thought I would take you to the library.<eos> The what?<eos> You've got lipstick all over you.<eos> Well, it's just that...<eos> Stefan lived through the... going here and there... doing crazy things on a whim.<eos> Oh, he'd do them for me.
- I don't peek on you.<eos> - That's a lie.<eos> You're always staring at my buppies.<eos> Only because they look so funny.<eos> You know what you look like now?<eos> You look like one of those pictures Paddy had.<eos> One of his Hoochie Coochie girls.<eos> I do not!<eos> Stop that, or I'll never talk to you again.<eos> See them jiggle, wiggle and shake.
Did I say I was pissed off with you?<eos> - It's only us two in here!<eos> - I'm pissed off with me!<eos> Haven't I got right to be pissed off with me?<eos> One million...<eos> Around one million...<eos> - Will 3,000 be enough?<eos> - For what?<eos> - For the pills you brought.<eos> - It's okay, I didn't pay for them.
Say "yes".<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes!<eos> Alright.<eos> Now just once more: "yes".<eos> I can understand that.<eos> That's good!<eos> That's very good.<eos> Alright now<eos> I'm going to say some words to you and you repeat them.
Because I can't.<eos> ~ Are you sure your dad isn't home?<eos> ~ Sure he's not home.<eos> He's out on a job.<eos> ~ Give me the keys.<eos> ~ What keys?<eos> The keys to your home.<eos> I have lost them.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> I just lost them.
Goodbye.<eos> Are you OK now?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Please, Fernanda.<eos> Young people have discovered everything, but the one thing they haven't discovered is a sense of duty.<eos> ~ Enough about Eugenio, it's not the time for that.<eos> ~ Why isn't it the time?<eos> When we got married, did we take things lightly?<eos> And our two children, have we brought them up laughing and joking?
The third Custodian was Catuso Phelpis, singer and ornithological registrar.<eos> Allia Fallanx, as pianist, ornithologist, cataloguer, apiarist and expert on flying reptiles, perpetuated and expanded the Custodian tradition.<eos> However, the publication of personal details of VUE Commission employees is forbidden. This embargo does not extend to their families, so it is possible to consider the VUE history of Allia's wife,<eos> Starling Fallanx, singer, firework enthusiast, wanderer, collector of berets, bird hats and cardboard boxes, authority on the nightingale, was struck down by the VUE near a late-flowering hawthorn bush on the road into the Manifold Valley.<eos> Starling met Allia just eight hours after the VUE. They were both suffering from sore feet.<eos> After some wanderings, with or without the VUE's disorienteering experience, she moved into the Tyddyn-Corn Farm with her children and hats when Allia became the Fourth Custodian of the Boulder Orchard.<eos> She likes green grass underneath her shoes<eos> Perhaps finding it difficult to cripple a moving target, the VUE's interest in Starling Fallanx has been sporadic.<eos> But now she has settled she can no longer taste salt, open her eyes under water, wear velvet or smell hawthorn blossom.<eos> But she can teach her daughters the 32 songs of the nightingale and astonish them by locking her Achilles tendons to grip apples with the soles of her feet.
I lost my shoes!<eos> -Your what?<eos> -My shoes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, watch it, buster.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> -Sorry.<eos> I'll fetch your bags.<eos> -No!<eos> You'll drop them!
-Your what?<eos> -My shoes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, watch it, buster.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> -Sorry.<eos> I'll fetch your bags.<eos> -No!<eos> You'll drop them!<eos> I'll get them myself.
And why are you so beautiful?<eos> I'm going to the school to give her these.<eos> You gonna look like that?<eos> -Like what?<eos> -Like it's a funeral.<eos> You've gotta smile and tell her she looks good.<eos> How are you an expert on women?<eos> I got seven wives. How many you got?<eos> -Why aren't you at home with them?<eos> -I know how to marry them.

Information on vampires totally absent from Tardis databanks.<eos> Okay.<eos> Try your folklore section.<eos> My folklore section contains vampire lore from 17 inhabited planets.<eos> I will begin with Earth.<eos> The legend of Count Dracula.<eos> No, thank you, not Dracula.<eos> Emergency instructions.<eos> There are 18,348 emergency instructions.<eos> I will now list them in code order. 1...
- The blonde?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I think he had you-know-what...<eos> Will you look at those stupid cows!<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> Something's weird.<eos> They look fake.<eos> Is this some kind of a joke?<eos> I don't dig the vibes here.<eos> Why don't you just drive around them.
No problem, girl.<eos> The only elastic is in my garter.<eos> He's here. Go on.<eos> Sing, so he doesn't suspect anything.<eos> Not in the balls!<eos> Why me?<eos> What have I done?<eos> Great.<eos> You'll be in a sorry state.<eos> Stand in line. I'll pass them down.
-I think we're on the right track.<eos> -Me too.<eos> With the factory backing, I'll go all over the world.<eos> -Can I go with you? -Uh-uh.<eos> -To Japan? Uh-uh.<eos> It's beautiful over there...<eos> Maya says you screwed the television guy to get me the contract...<eos> Is it true?<eos> My father used to say:<eos> Okay I love a kroket, and I'll still be eating them.
Do you find it very hard to direct yourself?<eos> No, I just have to resist the temptation to give myself too many extreme close-ups.<eos> Have you studied filmmaking in school?<eos> No, no, I didn't study anything in school.<eos> They studied me. I understand you studied philosophy at school.<eos> No, that's not true. I did take...<eos> I took one course in existential philosophy at New York University.<eos> And on the final, they gave me 10 questions.<eos> And I couldn't answer a single one of them, you know.<eos> I left them all blank.
Tomorrow night, nine o'clock.<eos> We should break in around 9.03, before the audience gets too bored.<eos> Jesus, guys, i don't know.<eos> My horoscope says, "trouble brewing on the horizon."<eos> And, i mean, we're fucking with the president of the united states!<eos> He fucks with us, doesn't he?<eos> You've seen how shitty business is today.<eos> Thanks to fuchs, we had nuns protesting outside when i got here.<eos> - Jim had to turn the fire hose on them.<eos> - I knocked them right on their ass too!
When I'm dead, you'll think of Marcel, because you'll never find another like him.<eos> I present Marcel Proust, in his nightshirt and uncombed.<eos> - Would you help again?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I've called you because I'm at a loss what to do.<eos> What's the matter, Mr.?<eos> The additions!<eos> And the margins are full.<eos> I could keep writing on loose pages, but...<eos> I always get them muddled up.
My youngest brother wanted to protect me.<eos> "Don't be cross with Celeste" he said, "or I'll cry"<eos> Someone shouted:<eos> "Fire!<eos> Fire!"<eos> The barn was full of straw.<eos> Mama climbed up with a bucket of water.<eos> She falls, gets up, climbs up with a second bucket.<eos> Her dress catches fire...<eos> The smoke, the storm, the flames the shouting, the cattle; we got there just in time to save them.
I can recognize any bird by the way it flies, however fast its flight, I follow it with my eyes and, without hesitation, name it... Bird!<eos> I call the hyena "orumba," I call the mosquito "Ouatabane," but ld rather not call it because it just might turn up.<eos> I wonder whats become of my nephew, Yogurtu Nghe, who suddenly had to flee the village owing to the scarcity of rhinoceroses.<eos> Yogurtu Nghe...<eos> He was the most handsome and best-looking youth in the tribe, his skin was so dark that in the village they called him "Blackie."<eos> His voice... his voice was as sonorous as the lions roar, it had the warmth of the panthers snarl, the deep roughness of the buffalos bellow, he sang... like an animal!<eos> I wonder whats become of my nephew Yogurtu...<eos> Nghe who suddenly had to flee the village owing to the scarcity of rhinoceroses?<eos> Maybe Yogurtu inherited the ominous fate of his grandfather, the renowned witch doctor Obtuso Nghe, renowned witch doctor from whom I learned the arts of sorcery and to whom came women from all over Africa so hed make them more beautiful by enlarging their heads.<eos> Obtuso spoke to them, spoke to them, their heads were left like this!
Oh, um, Sybil!<eos> I'm looking after Miss Tibbs, Basil.<eos> How are you feeling, dear?<eos> Won't be two minutes, okay?<eos> - Sorry about that, doctor.<eos> - Wash your hands first, please.<eos> Oh, right. And make sure this area is scrubbed before any more food is prepared in here.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Sausages excepted.<eos> You may cook them immediately.
- Sybil...<eos> - You seem to think that we girls should be aroused by people like Gladstone and Earl Haig and Baden-Powell, don't you?<eos> Well, at least they had a certain dignity.<eos> It's hard to imagine Earl Haig wandering round with his shirt open at the waist, covered with identity bracelets, isn't it?<eos> Well, he didn't mind the medals, did he?<eos> The military decorations?<eos> That's not the point.<eos> I suppose the reason you confuse them with monkeys is that monkeys have fun.<eos> They know how to enjoy themselves.<eos> That's what makes them sexy, I suppose.
It is so glorious when they bloom.<eos> Of course, the roses are my favorites.<eos> We have 20,000 rose bushes.<eos> And over here, we plant something different every year.<eos> I haven't quite decided what we'll plant this year.<eos> And that's the gardener's house.<eos> And this is the greenhouse.<eos> I like to watch the young plants grow.<eos> - It's wonderful, isn't it? - Yes.<eos> Young plants do much better if a person helps them.
The CIA's or the FBI's?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other.<eos> Not so far.<eos> We are not so far from each other.<eos> Our chairs are almost touching.<eos> Bravo.<eos> Our chairs are indeed almost touching.<eos> And we want to remain seated on them, correct?<eos> We don't want them snatched out from under us, am I right?
And I feel so guilty for my part in it. I wish it had never happened.<eos> I wish we could be together again, just the three of us.<eos> You're kidding yourself.<eos> Right now you're dreaming.<eos> From what Frank tells me, it was lousy from the very start. You never had anything real together.<eos> It would be better for everybody if you - well, if Frank divorced you and married me.<eos> We'd still let you see Candy at the weekends.<eos> That stinks!<eos> That stinks.<eos> We had beautiful things, things that you couldn't understand. And we'll have them again if you'd just leave him alone... and stop poisoning him against me and taking advantage of his loneliness.
At my house, instead, I have to make do with some bread and cheese.<eos> Would you like some wine?<eos> Could we have another glass?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Perhaps the taxes are high.<eos> They're what they are.<eos> I'm not the one who get the money.<eos> I only make them pay.
You must look carefully at all these things, and we must look at a dry twig, at a piece of bread, at grains of sand... We must even look at the air.<eos> What does the air do?<eos> Why are you doing that?<eos> Do what you were doing before.<eos> Go on, go on...<eos> Well then, what does the air do?<eos> The air makes the stars tremble.<eos> Are the star still, or do they tremble?<eos> - They tremble.<eos> - What makes them tremble?
How would I do that?<eos> You already have.<eos> I knew you would.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Can't we just drive around for a little while?<eos> What have you been doing?<eos> Living in Cuba.<eos> You?<eos> Modern warfare.<eos> Fighting people who hide grenades in shopping baskets, shoot up crowded hotels, hack the legs off cattle and leave them dying on their stumps.
The moist air is corroding the concrete, and the salt is rusting the metal.<eos> I took a nail clipper. I dug around the grille in the back of the cell.<eos> With some work I can dig that grille out of there, enlarge the hole and get into the utility corridor, that might lead to the roof.<eos> How will we hide the hole while we're working on it?<eos> We can tear the ads out of magazines and make cardboard out of them. Paint grilles on that and put it back in the hole. Maybe partially obscure it with a towel or a bathrobe or whatever.<eos> I've ordered an accordion, which I'm going to put in front of my hole.<eos> If we get out of the cell house, they'll know we're gone at the next count.<eos> We'll leave at night. That way, they won't know 'til the morning.<eos> We have to make dummy heads out of plaster, cardboard or whatever.<eos> Put them in the bunks, and the guards won't know.
- Aye.<eos> Where'd you make them impressions?<eos> They keep all them keys separate.<eos> - Do they?<eos> - Aye, they do.<eos> How'd you pull 'em?<eos> With incredible skill.<eos> The next gold shipment is in a week.<eos> This time we take it.<eos> Agar will replace the gold with these lead bars and throw the bags from the train at Romney, where Barlow will collect them and then drive to Folkestone.
Only then, will I give you your husband back.<eos> And as for me the absence of love is the most abject pain.<eos> The power of my love will bring him back to me.<eos> And you may be assured even the unthinkable will not deter me that you want to lay for me.<eos> Good night.<eos> Stop!<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> Nosferatu, the undead.<eos> He drinks the blood of his victims, and turns them into phantoms of the night.
I know it exists.<eos> I believe what I see with my own eyes.<eos> Faith...<eos> Faith...<eos> Yes, faith.<eos> Yes, faith, Dr. Van Helsing.<eos> Faith. Faith is the faculty in men which enables us to believe things we know to be untrue.<eos> You must come and help me destroy this monster.<eos> We must look for him.<eos> Coffins have come by boat from the Black Sea. We can search for them tonight, and destroy them.
Keep going.<eos> - Get off me, you pig.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Get in there.<eos> Let me out!<eos> Let me out of here!<eos> Let me out...<eos> What are you going to do with the three young women?<eos> Is it so hard to guess?<eos> I'll make them talk.
I know the perfect hiding place. An old ruined temple, not far from here.<eos> - Let's go, you can do it.<eos> - It's very close.<eos> I can't go on.<eos> To get there we'll have to swim across the lagoon. The water will refresh you.<eos> We will hide there.<eos> You're coming with us.<eos> How could they get away so easily?<eos> Have you found their tracks?<eos> No Madame, we've lost them.
I was the one who went to Bob Rigby's and word's got around.<eos> If I went out on a call and, by some horrid mischance, foot-and-mouth then broke out on that farm, they'd swear I was the carrier.<eos> Nonsense, of course, but I'm not going to risk having it said.<eos> Of course, if the outbreak extends, then I will end my self-imposed purdah.<eos> Oh, that's comforting.<eos> - Come on, Tris, he's right.<eos> If there's no epidemic, quarantine only lasts a month.<eos> All right, I haven't spoken.<eos> Bob's heifers?<eos> Ah, yes, I mentioned them to Judson at the Ministry.
The one I listed the bills in.<eos> Without it, I have no idea who's paid.<eos> It must be somewhere.<eos> - No, it's gone.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> It's no joke.<eos> Do you know what this means?<eos> Yes.<eos> That Siegfried will murder you instead of me having to.<eos> Everyone who paid their bills will get them again next month.
Beatrice and Julia can have everything.<eos> They get it, too.<eos> And what's the result?<eos> Two perfectly... discontented women.<eos> And it's a bloody shame.<eos> I'm so awfully fond of 'em both.<eos> Yes, it is a shame.<eos> That's life, old chap.<eos> This summer will be just like the last.<eos> Pack them off to Antibes for a couple of months and be here in time for the opening of the grouse season.
Oh.<eos> (Sighs heavily) - What are you going to do?<eos> Mend the puncture.<eos> I mean, about those shoes of yours.<eos> I'm not sure there's anything I can do.<eos> You'll have to change them.<eos> - They're all I've got.<eos> But they're soaking wet.<eos> It's OK.<eos> I'll mend the puncture, take them off and they'll dry out before we get there.
I sure have.<eos> And you've done it.<eos> Thank you, laddie.<eos> Thank you kindly for your expert help.<eos> Come on, come on, come on.<eos> Double bezique.<eos> I was wondering where those cards were hiding.<eos> - Well, now you know.<eos> - Why not show them separately?<eos> I wanted to see your face when I put them all down.
- Hey.<eos> - Put your hands up.<eos> What the hell are you up to, anyway?<eos> Is there a basement in this house?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Take me to it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Do you have any pictures of your son?<eos> There's an album on the table.<eos> What do you want them for?
- Thorn!<eos> Come here.<eos> Outside.<eos> Copy the blackboard!<eos> What were you trying to do, Damien?<eos> - What were you trying to do?<eos> - I was just answering questions, Sergeant.<eos> - You were showing off.<eos> - No, I just knew all the answers.<eos> Somehow, I just knew them all.
You say that you have to give to get.<eos> I can assure you that I have given a lot in my life.<eos> I have always been generous with women.<eos> And I don't mean just money.<eos> Whenever it came time to help ...<eos> I even made dentures for free!<eos> I assure you that I never pull back from the word "give" .<eos> Do you understand?<eos> So, is it my fault if I like women?<eos> No, you don't like women, you don't love them.
Desperately.<eos> It's a lot of space for one person.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was living with a woman who I was going to share it with.<eos> A chopped liver Torah?<eos> Last time it was the star of David.<eos> Did I ever tell you my grandparents were orthodox?<eos> No.<eos> My grandfather loved lady wrestlers.<eos> He used to watch them on TV Friday nights after everybody else had left.
Yes, I do.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Sometime during the last war<eos> Anita weisshaupt secretly gave birth to a son.<eos> Shortly afterwards, she brought her baby here to the orphanage and gave it for adoption.<eos> The child was christened Erwin and all the sisters loved him.<eos> He was a quiet child which they found agreeable, so they said he was a good boy.<eos> Even in the worst days after the war they made sure that the child always had enough to eat.<eos> Rather too much than too little.<eos> In return, the sisters expected him to love them.
Anton couldn't stand the smell of dead animals because of the blood in particular.<eos> He stopped eating meat overnight.<eos> That's how it all started.<eos> It's as simple as that, you see?<eos> is the wine good?<eos> Fine, thanks.<eos> why... I mean, why?<eos> -why I want to hang myself? .<eos> -Yes.<eos> I don't want to let things go on being real because I perceive them.
My nose, it's bleeding.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Who is it?<eos> It's Matthew.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> What happened?<eos> - Back here.<eos> - What happened to your nose?<eos> I called you here as a friend.<eos> Do you report certain things when you run into them...
I was watching the leaves.<eos> Get to your feet.<eos> Are you trying to make a fool of me?<eos> I'm sure one can only a fool of himself, Mr. Copley.<eos> Silence!<eos> Very interesting.<eos> It appears we have a philosopher watching the leaves.<eos> I'll assist you in your philosophic bent.<eos> After chapel you'll go out into the grounds and you will pick up exactly 1149 leaves, which number, as you know, is the terminating date of the Second Crusade.<eos> Then you'll bring those leaves to my study and we will count them and if I find one leaf more or less, I will trash you, Morlar.
How many "T's" in "bloodletting"?<eos> Two.<eos> What are you writing?<eos> An ode to spring.<eos> How do you spell "massacre"?<eos> M-a-s-s-a-c-r-e.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Golly, how come you get all the great stories?<eos> A good reporter doesn't get great stories.<eos> A good reporter makes them great.
Cleofe wrote it to me on the day of her death.<eos> She writes me about the husband's letter and his perverted love to Matilde.<eos> Then about their decision to live together and then she goes on "I can care less for my husband, if I find or lose him, ...but something is false in his letter I feel like something has to happen.<eos> Angelo write me and give me an advice". And a PS.<eos> "In Gavirate I changed the corn sort.<eos> We'll see how the crop will be."<eos> Does that sound like a letter of a person who's going to die?<eos> - Sorry, do you rent out bicycles?<eos> - No, not any more.<eos> - Did you rent them out?
We've timber enough to burn here.<eos> ...to drive a train that will bring you lime... (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) ...and methane gas, and salt, and anything else you want, as long as you've plenty to send back.<eos> The railway at Dovedale runs out of track this end but at the other it joins up with the main line.<eos> It does that way too, where both carriages are.<eos> It's a long roundtrip, of course, and all the points had to be set back before they left.<eos> It took Greg weeks to check it out.<eos> Is that what he was doing?<eos> He got back to Dovedale the day after you left, with two girls he found at Winterton.<eos> It was the girls, not Greg in that car.<eos> Greg sent them to check out this end but the car broke down.
No! No, not before asking.<eos> We'll ask in the morning.<eos> Charlie? CHARLES: Yes, Seth.<eos> Charlie, listen, I found Jack.<eos> He's in a bad way.<eos> He got two letters on him.<eos> He's got what?<eos> Two letters.<eos> One for you and one for Jenny.<eos> I've got them here, do you want me to open them?
Take the hand of Matilda in return for Isabella.<eos> Thus they linked the blood of two old families.<eos> When Isabella's father asked Matilda for her hand, then suddenly...<eos> My careful scrutiny of the door aperture, the side walls and the stones around produced a microscopic metal fragment, as if some huge body was trying to push its way out.<eos> After this warning Isabella's father cancels his engagement to Matilda and, equally, refuses to give Isabella to Manfred.<eos> When Manfred sees his plans fail, he decides in a fit of rage to kill Isabella but by mistake kills his daughter Matilda.<eos> This, however, is not elementary to our investigation.<eos> We are more concerned with the prophecy being thus fulfilled.<eos> Note, please, the disgorged stones.<eos> As if some gigantic force lifted the castle walls and threw them down into the valley.
camera director<eos> - Take care of her, will you?<eos> - OK, Miss Agnieszka.<eos> - And there? What's in there? - There is nothing interesting.<eos> Oh, this our oldest collection.<eos> - From before the war? - No, from some twenty years ago.<eos> We are the only institution to buy works of art.<eos> - Were they ever presented? - Excuse me?<eos> Naturally.<eos> - You didn't see them? - I didn't go to exhibitions then,
- Hydrogen peroxide.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> We'll check that.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> It certainly does.<eos> You thought it wouldn't, didn't you?<eos> How could a worker do such a thing to another worker?<eos> Don't people understand us?<eos> They want houses, don't they?<eos> We won't built them in a century with the old methods.
That's why I'm gonna dive there tonight.<eos> You haven't answered my question.<eos> I'll answer.<eos> I'm turning this over to the government.<eos> I'm all the government you need, boy!<eos> Put that right back.<eos> The reasons are two:<eos> mine and yours.<eos> Mine:<eos> If there are thousands of ampoules there and Cloche gets them that junk will be on the street in N.Y. in a week.
Say that again.<eos> I don't wanna stay here without you.<eos> Go away, will you?<eos> That was a stupid business last night.<eos> And cruel.<eos> Very cruel.<eos> You did not go to the police.<eos> I've been tossing and turning all night, wondering why.<eos> Because there's thousands of ampoules of morphine down there.<eos> You want them, and I got them.
- Why? Don't you like it?<eos> It's hot.<eos> - That really hurts.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> I have a catch in my garter. It pinched my thigh.<eos> Let me see if it scratched the skin.<eos> How about that?<eos> Is she always that democratic with her maids?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She changes them often.
- Possessed by Pazuzu?<eos> That's what my mother used to tell me.<eos> - Locusts?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Let me show you!<eos> This is one of the main control stations in equatorial Africa.<eos> The key factor is the brushing of the wings.<eos> when it is dry the grasshoppers go their own way, happy individuals.<eos> when a heavy rain hatches them in large numbers they crowd together.<eos> Their wings brush against each other. The agitation transforms them.
May I kiss you?<eos> No, a real kiss.<eos> Bye.<eos> So the pretty bra salesgirl can make love... with soft-skinned boys only.<eos> It's not my first turn-down, but it 's the most unexpected.<eos> I always thought it would happen with a young girl. But a woman my age rejects me!<eos> That's why I'm going to try to write this book.<eos> Also because with all the photos I've accumulated, I might start to forget.<eos> I've already forgotten so many of their names... even though I remember the faces and places.<eos> I had kept my date books for several years. I threw them out when I left Paris.
You have nothing better to do, anyway.<eos> - I was thinking of doing my nails.<eos> - Brooklyn, or what?<eos> I just said.<eos> It's going to be Brooklyn.<eos> 2482 Flatbush Avenue.<eos> 2842 Flatbush Avenue.<eos> Same thing.<eos> What about your nails?<eos> Why don't you do them?
Well, frankly, it is a little hard to believe.<eos> - What do witches do?<eos> - They are malefic, negative and destructive.<eos> Their knowledge of the art of the occult gives them tremendous powers.<eos> They can change the course of events and people's lives, but only to do harm.<eos> - You don't believe me?<eos> - No, I--<eos> Their goal is to accumulate great personal wealth,<eos> But that can only be achieved by injury to others.<eos> They can cause suffering, sickness and even the death... Of those who, for whatever reason, have offended them.
for your first attempt.<eos> actually.<eos> We'll keep these.<eos> Deucedly fine blades. Considering they were made by trolls.<eos> They don't seem like troll blades to me.<eos> Probably stolen.<eos> - See these strange runes?<eos> - Whatever are runes?<eos> Ancient writing.<eos> Mine has them too. Can you make them out?
He makes confessor and hangman instruments of his lascivious will<eos> Even if it costs me my life I'll save you<eos> But it's not safe to wait until dark<eos> The daylight frightens me<eos> Outside there's an open garden<eos> Then a thicket runs past the fields to my villa<eos> - l know it<eos> - Here's the key I'll meet you there before dark.<eos> Take the clothes with you<eos> Should I put them on?
- A little wine every now and then is good.<eos> - Even more than a little.<eos> It's nice here.<eos> What is nice?<eos> Anita who goes to bed, the scent of the soup, the fact you're well together,<eos> and you mother sleeping near the fire.<eos> If you like it so much come and live here.<eos> I'll place a bed for you behind there.<eos> Have you see the court's door?<eos> - The master came and shut them every night.
You want all the material requested by the White House?<eos> All White House transactions are confidential.<eos> Thank you very much, gentlemen.<eos> - We need a sympathetic face.<eos> - We're not going to find one here.<eos> You want every request since when?<eos> - When did he start?<eos> - July of '71.<eos> I imagine the whole last year.<eos> I'm not sure you want them, but I've got them.
Well, I... there is no big monkey.<eos> I don't see any monkees in the set. There are other animals... but I don't see a single monkey.<eos> That big monkey looks like a young man that<eos> I met once in 1912 beforthe big war.<eos> Nowadays men like him are not seen anymore.<eos> It's snowing in the theatre, a very bad sign...<eos> Leave it, leave it...<eos> I don't believe it, but what's he doing be careful, you are breaking him.<eos> The old bags are all upset...<eos> who can control them now?
Then I'll just snore.<eos> I've already slept enough.<eos> Come now.<eos> We'll have it comfortable.<eos> - Where are my slippers?<eos> - What slippers?<eos> - The other ones.<eos> - They're in the closet.<eos> - No, I looked there.<eos> - Yes, my dear, I put them there.
But speak loudly, so everyone can hear you.<eos> There are many different makes.<eos> Suzuki, Gus Kuhn, Triumph, BSA,<eos> BMW, Kawasaki, Peugeot.<eos> Remain seated.<eos> Mr Richet.<eos> I'll take care of this.<eos> I've just been told that the De Luca brothers gave out some toys to certain students.<eos> It was generous of them, but sadly, those little guns don't really belong to them.<eos> They bought them with money that wasn't really theirs.
Freeze, this is the police.<eos> Drop your weapons and place your hands above your heads.<eos> And in the local news, six youth gang members were killed in a shoot-out last night with police in South Los Angeles.<eos> Police Commissioner Davidson called a news conference earlier this morning to comment on the shooting.<eos> As Police Commissioner of Los Angeles County, I have called this emergency news conference. We have a crisis.<eos> The juvenile gang problem is completely out of control.<eos> The missing automatic weapons have not been recovered.<eos> We now have a lead which shows that some of the weapons have fallen into the wrong hands.<eos> It's true that law enforcement is being driven to deplorable extremes, but those guns are out there.<eos> And believe me, if the people who have them get organized, no one will stand a chance.
"What is lighter than a feather ?<eos> Ashes.<eos> And what is lighter than ashes ?<eos> The wind.<eos> And lighter than the wind ?<eos> Woman.<eos> And lighter than woman ?<eos> Nothing."<eos> We exercise much power over women, much tyranny, and we made them accept it only because they are kinder, more reasonable, more generous than man.<eos> Such qualities which should have made them superior to us, instead, put them at our mercy, because men, in fact, are a hundred times more unreasonable, more cruel, violent.

Now bring me a basket of eggs, a bottle of wine from Spain, ginger, cinnamon, and clover.<eos> My necklace on Casanova !<eos> My robust Righetto, will you accept me as the woman, who, for one hour, will receive the impulses of your rustic loins ?<eos> May the good Lord make me worthy, Princess.<eos> Challengers, go to your places, and begin their pleasant, I hope, trial.<eos> He put eighteen eggs inside !<eos> God protect you and give you health !<eos> Oh !<eos> Nineteen !<eos> He is drinking all of them !
Men, women and children all.<eos> It's time to stand up and be counted.<eos> Don't you gonna be throwed back for 500 years.<eos> We're gonna have a picket line in the morning.<eos> And we hope to have a big picket line.<eos> It's gonna be set up a little bit different than the last one.<eos> 'Cause - We can't have a picket line at the bridge with a.30-caliber machine gun shooting at you.<eos> These ladies are setting it up.<eos> We're gonna have to get out there and back them.<eos> That's all there are to it. They come up to back us, and we're not even backing them.
Why all of a sudden?<eos> Perhaps a miniscule adjustment.<eos> You seem almost disappointed.<eos> Would you prefer it if the Temians attacked us?<eos> Then Akala's difficult decision would be made.<eos> Wonderful, it's working.<eos> Get to work!<eos> Push them to work hard and fast!<eos> Machines would be much faster.<eos> Why don't we use them?
It's got a tree on it.<eos> I can't pitch from there.<eos> give it a try.<eos> Beethoven never gave up.<eos> Beethoven never had a tree on his piano.<eos> What is that in center field?<eos> Charlie Brown. Everybody knows that.<eos> Good grief.<eos> Where are all our bats?<eos> we used them to make stakes for the tomato plants. no.
Monsters!<eos> They'll never turn me into Simone Choule.<eos> Never!<eos> Monsieur Trelkovsky.<eos> Do you remember the conditions on which I let you move in?<eos> I do, Monsieur Zy.<eos> May I know what you're referring to?<eos> - I'm referring to women.<eos> - Oh, yes, of course.<eos> Then, why do you bring them here?
The first what?<eos> Visitor?<eos> There have always been visitors.<eos> On my own planet we found evidence of visitors.<eos> You must have seen them here.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Well, I've seen them.<eos> I've seen their footsteps and their places.<eos> I've seen those things.<eos> We've all seen them.
My son was true-blue, Mr. Wales.<eos> He never lied.<eos> It'll be there, all right.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I'm sure it will be.<eos> Cottonwoods, live oaks wild horses antelope lots of quail.<eos> You see them?<eos> What?<eos> The clouds over there.<eos> Clouds are like dreams floating across a sky-blue mind.<eos> I never thought of them that way.
I will make a cup of tea, and everything will be a little bit better, eh?<eos> As my old mama always say, there is nothing like a cup of tea!<eos> Milk?<eos> Sugar?<eos> Thief, thief!<eos> You come back, please.<eos> I'm going to call the cops!<eos> Here's 60 quid for your poster.<eos> Here, what about them oranges then?<eos> Who's going to pay for them, then?
You know, these disguises are getting expensive.<eos> Crime costs. Where's it at?<eos> Four cars back, room "C." Stay out of trouble.<eos> - Hilly, are you all right? - George, watch it.! Don't come in here.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> That's what I was gonna ask you.<eos> I'm sorry about your head.<eos> I never would have gone back to the compartment if I thought that you were gonna...<eos> - The Rembrandt letters.<eos> - Devereau's got them.

But I was thinking maybe we could listen to it on your record player.<eos> Now, going back through 40 years of Chick Webb.<eos> You gotta be kidding.<eos> What?<eos> This is a dirty movie.<eos> No, no.<eos> This is a movie that a lot of couples come to.<eos> -All kinds of couples go here.<eos> -You sure about that?<eos> Yeah, I see them all the time.
- Francis had meta 'quotas.<eos> - They never yielded a penny.<eos> - There is no 'wonder, since Wheal Grace has never yielded even a penny.<eos> - But now fruit, and also a lot '.<eos> - I believe that the shares were sold before this' happen.<eos> - By what right?<eos> Ms. Poldark, as guardian of his son.<eos> - You mean the lady Warleggan?<eos> - So was Mrs. Poldark.<eos> Who bought them?
- We have actually got pens in the hotel. Thank you so much.<eos> Somewhere...<eos> I mean where are the pens?<eos> Would you believe it?<eos> I mean, there are no pens here. This is supposed to be a hotel.<eos> - What are they doing in there?<eos> - I put them there. - Why?<eos> - Just sign there, Mr Walt.<eos> - Because you're always losing them, Basil.<eos> - I am not always losing them.

Who is?<eos> Found you.<eos> -Oh, I like your wheelchair.<eos> Would you believe a tanker of petrol just arrived?<eos> -A tanker?<eos> -No kidding. A guy and a posh chick, I reckon they want to join.<eos> Told them to put it in the yard.<eos> Come and have a buthcer's.<eos> New potatoes.<eos> We got them for our cabbages from people a few miles away and the peas.
What's that?<eos> -TOM: What?<eos> Sheep!<eos> Now, I'm going to take this area down to the river.<eos> I want you two to go through the garden and cover the hill on the other side. TOM: Right-o, Greg, boy.<eos> And don't just put these down anywhere.<eos> I want them set by well-established rabbit runs.<eos> Now, don't worry, Greg, boy, you're talking to an expert. Uh-huh.<eos> Well, let's have a look at your hands. -Aye?<eos> -Now, when did you last wash them?
First, I thought I'd be terrified, but now it's close I'm getting quite calm.<eos> (EMMA GASPS) -Right, get your things.<eos> -She's staying here. -You heard me.<eos> -She's not coming with you.<eos> -Now, get out of here. -Now, look.<eos> I got three men outside and we're all armed.<eos> Now, I don't want any more trouble than what's is necessary.<eos> I'm just taking what belongs to me.<eos> -Now, get the coins and we'll go.<eos> -Norman's got them.
Which leads to the Grail?<eos> -Who are you?<eos> -We are the knights who say "Ni"!<eos> -No!<eos> Not the knights who say "Ni"?<eos> -The same!<eos> -Who are they?<eos> -We are the keepers of the sacred words.<eos> "Ni," "Peng," and "Neee Wom"!<eos> Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale.
No, no, no, no, no!<eos> I've heard this many times before.<eos> And I'm not offended!<eos> Horst is always trying to prevent me from hearing what people think.<eos> But we'll ignore him this once.<eos> Something you may not get another chance to do.<eos> You are shocked by German machine guns killing Jews in this day and age, are you?<eos> Is that any worse than German guns killing Arabs?<eos> Many of the troops of General Dion are equipped with the finest guns that Germany produces now.<eos> And he uses them!
My wife whacked her head against the house then into the manure!<eos> I kicked her black and blue.<eos> When did she burn you out?<eos> We were at court when the wagon driver came and told us... that our hut was on fire.<eos> You want to work in the factory?<eos> Come next Tuesday, I have no time today.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Listen to what she wrote.<eos> The roses are lovely, not from Lodz I think.<eos> Maybe you brought them from Nice?
I mean, don't you go out, don't you do sports?<eos> - Don't you ride?<eos> - She rides, she rides...<eos> Every two weeks.<eos> - That's not like riding at all.<eos> - It's even worse.<eos> - Not enough time for the handling!<eos> - You should ride more often, Rambaldo.<eos> And the children look pale too.<eos> Don't you take them to ski?
- ♪ That I'm in love with you ♪<eos> - Grab that scarf for me.<eos> Oh, Edie, quit it, for God's sake.<eos> [ Edie Giggling ]<eos> There's an extra knife.<eos> I'll put it in the middle. I forgot the forks.<eos> Do you mind getting my slippers, Edie?<eos> Get my slippers.<eos> Will you, please?<eos> You know where you put them.
I dressed like this so as not to embarrass you. Well, thanks, Adele. Thank you.<eos> Albert, I absolutely had to see you.<eos> I've received the consent from my parents.<eos> So your father changed his mind.<eos> I wouldn't have believed it.<eos> So you see, we can be married now.<eos> I've already told you, Adele, it's out of the question.<eos> How you've changed, Albert.<eos> You can't have forgotten the letters you wrote to me.<eos> I haven't forgotten them.
He himself told you about the arrow.<eos> But then priests must be mistaken about Imbra.<eos> He not angry because... god marrying a mortal... but because son of man pretend to be a god.<eos> Roxanne, don't be afraid... I wouldn't harm you.<eos> When the time comes, you'll catch fire, I warrant... like all women should when their husbands hold them close.<eos> But you won't perish, girl, I promise you that.<eos> Well, Danny... the time has come, as the saying goes.<eos> When do you leave?<eos> At first light.<eos> I thought you might like to take a peek in the boxes before I nail them shut... see what I'm taking.
We are awaiting the arrival of Barbara Jean... who has been away for treatment at the Baltimore Burn Center.<eos> Already, prior to her arrival, around 3,000 Barbara Jean fans... and supporters are here. They are being held inside the terminal by security police.<eos> Ma'am, excuse me. Am I late for Barbara Jean's plane?<eos> - I don't think so, but they're not gonna let you out there. - Thank you, ma'am.<eos> Members of the Chamber of Commerce and other fans are on the way.<eos> Also, it's reported Haven Hamilton will make an appearance here.<eos> There is no question about being involved.<eos> The question is, what to do?<eos> It is the very nature of government... to strain at a gnat and swallow a camel.<eos> As loyal citizens, we accept our take-home pay... understand most of the deductions... and even, to a degree, come to expect them.
A memory pool, you see.<eos> He's supposed to tell us where things are and what they might possibly mean.<eos> Look, Zero.<eos> A visitor.<eos> Jonathan E, the rollerball champion.<eos> You've filed away a lot of data on him.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> - Does it answer you?<eos> - Oh, yes, it speaks.<eos> It finds things and loses them and confuses itself.
Everybody in Brooklyn's talking to each other.<eos> I didn't know you smoked.<eos> I quit three years ago.<eos> - You're so pale.<eos> - It's the light in here.<eos> What are you gonna do there?<eos> - See a guy.<eos> - More secrets.<eos> Like those pictures you hide.<eos> Yes. Someday, I'd like to show them to you, if you live through this.
- Well, a labourer's shot...<eos> - You mean 300 grams...<eos> - Oh, never mind the amount, comrades...<eos> - Well, I was on my own.<eos> I just had to take that spirit away from them, literally, one way or another.<eos> And I got Sawicki to bring the spirit to the factory gates that evening.<eos> In the meantime I called the police.<eos> I watched him transport the can.<eos> Then the police arrived and took the spirit.<eos> One thing I didn't foresee was that they would fill up two bottles and hide them behind a cabinet beforehand.
Just our luck.<eos> Let's work fast. I've had it with encyclopedias for today.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Do you know Flammarion Publishing?<eos> We sell art books. You know, art classics. Here's one on Titian.<eos> - Listen, I'm in a hurry.<eos> - He was a great painter.<eos> - Not interested.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> You haven't even looked at them.
The entrance to the ventilation duct must be just through here.<eos> HARRY:<eos> You sure, Doctor?<eos> It doesn't look familiar.<eos> DOCTOR:<eos> Look out, Harry!<eos> (SARAH SCREAMING) Jump!<eos> I'll never eat oysters again.<eos> -They're not very fast.<eos> -It's obviously why Davros discarded them.
- He stopped me last night and asked me to drive him home.<eos> He said he followed him.<eos> - He said those who followed him?<eos> No, 'it was rather reticent.<eos> He had with him 'a lot of money?<eos> As I recall, he had never again 'of the price of a glass.<eos> I do not know, maybe that evening had.<eos> Prudie told me that he found 15 guineas in his tobacco pouch.<eos> 15 guineas?<eos> Where the hell took them?
- And here I thought it was a welcome courtesy visit.<eos> - No, my dear, Captain McNeil is still investigating the death of Daniel Keren.<eos> Murder ...<eos> - ... His murder, Captain Poldark.<eos> - Yes'.<eos> It seems that this fact is underestimated.<eos> I'm trying to convince him that Dr. Enys should not be considered a suspect.<eos> - No, Dwight.<eos> This' out of the question.<eos> - Dr. Enys save lives, not destroy them.
What little girls?<eos> Pav_BAR_e's daughters.<eos> Yes, so what?<eos> Take them to the dancing school, or we won't stand a chance!<eos> But where do I get the money?<eos> They want 50 rubles.<eos> Farewell, our rubles.<eos> All right, go and do it.<eos> Tell that ballet master that the girls are recommended by the police.<eos> He'll admit them to dancing classes, or I'll have him drummed out of the Veriyski Quarter!
If at least you can answer the questions on history, then we can give you some morphine or something like that, okay?<eos> Thank you, doctor.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dear Sir, I wish to protest in the strongest possible terms.<eos> Yours sincerely, Brigadier N.F. Marwood-Git, bracket, retired.<eos> Read that back, will you, Brian?<eos> "And when he had built up Cedron, he sent horsemen there and an host of footmen to the end that, issuing out they might make outroads upon the ways of Judea as the king commanded them."<eos> Good. Pop it in an envelope and bung it off.<eos> It's no good bottling things up, Brian.<eos> If you feel them, you must just say them or you'll just go mad.
From what?<eos> From the apes, of course.<eos> I'll be back as soon as I can.<eos> Apes?<eos> That's what the man said.<eos> These two humans are strangers, and they are insane.<eos> Don't listen to them!<eos> Report their whereabouts to us at once if you should see them.<eos> When I was a kid in Jersey City I couldn't even see the stars.<eos> I used to dream about them though.
Back.<eos> I need some help out here.<eos> Alan, no key.<eos> Look again.<eos> Who is it?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Who's got the keys to your cell?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - The keys.<eos> Who has them?
Oh, for...<eos> There's that same smell.<eos> It's coming from there.<eos> It's the same stuff from the temple.<eos> The gas is being drawn up through here.<eos> Yeah, and then collected in these bottles.<eos> This is a do-it-yourself kit for making poison gas bombs.<eos> What are gas bombs?<eos> - Talia, what are these jugs used for?<eos> - I have never seen them before.
You can't control it.<eos> You'll start with the apes, but you can wipe out the whole planet.<eos> All our lives we have obeyed, begged and crawled and gave up those we loved, because the apes were strong.<eos> Now the gods have made me strong.<eos> I will free my people!<eos> Not this way.<eos> You can't win freedom by destroying the world!<eos> I will teach them to make masks like yours.<eos> We will fight the apes again.<eos> The gas will kill them, but the masks will save our lives.
Well, then we'd better get going.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No! Earlier on, one of the policemen was here. But I stayed on the other side of street.<eos> You can't imagine what they gave me to eat at the station.<eos> When the policemen questioned me, I remembered that Mommy and I used to live here in Wuppertal. When I was little.<eos> Not my grandma.<eos> The policemen looked it up... and I was right.<eos> And Mommy wasn't called Van Dam, but Krüger.<eos> And then I remembered, and I told the police that we used to travel to Grandma's by train. And it couldn't be very far from here, because we were always back in the evening.<eos> And when Grandma read a story to me, the pages always rustled when she turned them, because little pieces of coal came in through the window.
Let's have coffee in the lounge<eos> Rador has a special blend<eos> He's a fascinating man.<eos> I can see why you're so in love<eos> We share many tastes<eos> We enjoy hunting, fine dining and succulent meals it's good to share one's pleasures<eos> What are these heads?<eos> Aren't they amazing?<eos> Do you like them?<eos> I'm proud of them and my husband loves them
Bloody hell!<eos> There's a curse on this village.<eos> The demons are free.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Tell me!<eos> There were two ghosts.<eos> They were staggering about.<eos> Pale and covered in blood, with crazed eyes.<eos> - There were two women.<eos> - Where did you see them?
- What did you want?<eos> - Some toast.<eos> You took away my plate.<eos> Here, take this one.<eos> These people are....<eos> Vera.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I can't find the tea bags.<eos> Could you show me where they are?<eos> I looked all over down here, and I don't see them anywhere.
Enough's enough, Curly.<eos> You can't eat the Venetian blinds, I just got them.
- I'll call you.<eos> See you soon!<eos> I need to ask you about the eighth reel, the sequence with the mother.<eos> We'll look at it later.<eos> At every level, I feel I'm blocked.<eos> By taking my childhood as the subject for this film...<eos> I get the feeling I'm exploiting it.<eos> It's the same with the landscape.<eos> The more I describe it, the more vague it gets.<eos> When you start to objectify yourself and your background... you turn them into a cheap spectacle.
And the rest of you.<eos> With your high morals!<eos> As you may have noticed, all the town's young females have run around with their tongues hanging out, chasing down every male just for a quickie.<eos> And you close your eyes to that!<eos> Just because of taxes.<eos> You want to have your cake and eat it too.<eos> And you'll ruin this young woman's life!<eos> And you're the town's so-called Wise Men!<eos> You're selling out your own daughters for a nickel.<eos> And won't even let them keep a man.
You can fry it yourself.<eos> Not uhm but yes.<eos> How are you feeling now?<eos> When I bandage myself it doesn't hurt.<eos> You'll look silly with a bandage.<eos> Better go to the doctor's.<eos> I've got to ask my doctor to prescribe those special elastic tights for me.<eos> - For the varicose veins.<eos> - But you've got no varicose veins.<eos> A lot of women get them during pregnancy.
I don't want to throw around empty metaphors but it's as though you're a theatre audience.<eos> You can watch but you can't take part yourself.<eos> I'm a, how shall I say, a social animal.<eos> I like having people around me.<eos> I want to know everything.<eos> I'm one of those people who will squeeze in everywhere.<eos> I mean, I'm not a sly boots or anything, I just seem to get through to people easily.<eos> And this illness obviously rules out certain things right from the word go.<eos> Some people really brought it home to me...<eos> What got me down the most was that it was the people... the closest people, or at least I'd thought of them as such.
- Look, I'm full up now.<eos> - Bon appetit.<eos> - Thank you, Captain.<eos> Well, Spockettin, look.<eos> Click click, no sound now.<eos> - Your stomach is more logical than you.<eos> - It's silent when full.<eos> - And you are silent when you are not talking about logic, Spockettin.<eos> Hey look, why are your ears so sharp?<eos> Did you father pull them a lot when you were a kid?
And for him not to bother us.<eos> Heard the news, Kit?<eos> No.<eos> Been in all the headlines.<eos> What's that?<eos> You've been fired.<eos> Ain't that a helluva note?<eos> Yeah, how about that?<eos> I won't need my keys.<eos> I'll leave them where they'll be nice and handy.
If anything should miscarry, I'll signal you as arranged.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Hurry, man.<eos> We need it.<eos> The school bus will be operational, Governor.<eos> The convoy will join us atjunction C.<eos> Get moving.<eos> Ricky?<eos> Without guns, we have no power.<eos> We shall take the guns, and we shall keep them.
After the war the nationality of the island was uncertain.<eos> And sometime after that, Han bought it.<eos> What do you know about Han?<eos> He lives like a king on that island, totally self-sufficient.<eos> All of his efforts, seemingly are directed towards supporting what he calls his school of martial arts.<eos> Han's only contact with the outside world is this tournament which he holds every three years.<eos> This was a stewardess, Mary King, found floating in the harbor.<eos> Nothing unusual about a body in the harbor. But this girl was last seen at a party aboard Han's private junk.<eos> They had reported her lost at sea before the body was found.<eos> We believe he selects attractive girls methodically builds their dependence on drugs then sells them to an elite clientele around the world.
May we have a word?<eos> - I'm in a hurry.<eos> What about?<eos> It's a very urgent matter.<eos> There are two policewomen.<eos> They don't know where my surgery is.<eos> They're following up on a report.<eos> - Do they have a search warrant?<eos> They haven't mentioned one.<eos> - If we send them off they'll be back.
He'll be married someday.<eos> Look, miss Emma.<eos> You love traveling.<eos> All the shadows of the Orient in one glass, an evening at home, no television, relaxed in your armchair, the south seas at your fingertips.<eos> Look, look!<eos> Tahiti, pink beaches and lagoons.<eos> Do you see the palm trees?<eos> Over there!<eos> Don't you see a thing?<eos> Drink this, then you'll see them.
Girls, after you.<eos> How are you? I want you to meet two beautiful young ladies here.<eos> This is my good friend, Charlie.<eos> This is my good friend, Tony, who owns the joint.<eos> This is, what's your name, darling? -Sarah.<eos> -Sarah, Sarah Kline, right?<eos> Sarah Kline, this is Tony.<eos> This is...what's your name?<eos> Heather, Heather Weintraub, right?<eos> I met them in the Village.
Can I come up here very often to see him?<eos> - Certain dates, is it? - Any day of the week.<eos> Is it?<eos> That's not so bad, then.<eos> 'Cos I do miss him really, you know.<eos> Help yourself to an apple, son.<eos> I don't like apples.<eos> (Whispers) There's a mouse listening.<eos> Do you know what pearls look like?<eos> Do you know where your mother kept them?

"Chew the coconut well then swallow the pulp.<eos> One each day, for strength.<eos> My thoughts are with you. Squinter."<eos> Dega.<eos> I'll be a son of a bitch.<eos> Dega.<eos> I'm still here, you bastards.<eos> Prisoner, show yourself.<eos> You've been receiving coconuts.<eos> Unless you tell us who sent them, your rations will be cut in half.
- Bob.<eos> Bob.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Mess around with him one more time, I'll send your ass back to Texas.<eos> Don't.<eos> I think I'd like to keep him here a while.<eos> I fold, Billy.<eos> Folding three queens, now, are you?<eos> You must be afraid I'll go out a loser, Bell.<eos> - I guess I just ain't seeing them.
-Go with God.<eos> Schmuck.<eos> Gilbert?<eos> Hey, Mr. Donovan.<eos> I have something for you.<eos> Get inside.<eos> Great.<eos> Handmade, isn't that?<eos> Do you have the words straight?<eos> -I won't understand them if I live to be 1 00.
Patera!<eos> Patera!<eos> Patera!<eos> Patera!<eos> I feel like a caterpillar.<eos> When I was a child, I kept a caterpillar in the basement all winter.<eos> We pampered it and fed it leaves. And then it pupated and eventually became a beautiful butterfly.<eos> Real tender and the wings stuck together like this.<eos> We put it on a plate and carefully carried it out in the garden.<eos> The sun warmed its wings and then he unfolded them.
What?<eos> Literally, as Miss Rose would doubtless say in her assiduous way, reproduction without sexual union.<eos> Oh, what is all this?<eos> I mean, y-y-you've got f-f-fake biology, fake religion.<eos> Sir, have these children never heard of Jesus?<eos> Himself the son of a virgin, impregnated, I believe, by a ghost.<eos> Do sit down, Sergeant.<eos> Shocks are so much better absorbed with the knees bent.<eos> Please.<eos> Now, those children out there, they're jumping through the flames in the hope that the god of fire will make them fruitful.
Nothing of any importance.<eos> Well, if you could tell us what happened?<eos> I was working late.<eos> I must have dropped off.<eos> Freak gust of wind, blew some papers off my desk, I woke up rather confused, I was picking up the papers when Miss Paget came in.<eos> But you did mention ghosts.<eos> Did I?<eos> Must have been having a nightmare.<eos> But the French windows were shut.<eos> I closed them before I went to bed.
"of norway," is that?<eos> Just put down what I say.<eos> Do I put that down? Course you don't put that down!<eos> Well, what about that?<eos> Look!<eos> Don't put that down.<eos> Just put down...<eos> wait a mo, wait a mo.<eos> Now, when I've got these antlers on... When I've got these antlers on I am dictating<eos> And when I take them off, I'm not dictating. "I'm not dictating."
- Lie down. Orders are to sleep.<eos> - How is Galka?<eos> - Where's Rita?<eos> - She's up there with Vaskov.<eos> What?<eos> You hear that?<eos> That's birds.<eos> Yes, magpies.<eos> The magpies are all upset there.<eos> It means someone's coming and upsetting them.
- We picked up all the equipment.<eos> Thank you for the equipment.<eos> Now listen to some more orders.<eos> You will first eat, then collect your things and march eastward.<eos> There won't be any help coming.<eos> And the Germans are coming this way.<eos> So we can't afford to waste time.<eos> And you, Fedot?<eos> It抣l be my turn to try and gain 24 hours.<eos> Those three girls who'll never return, I'll remember them till my last day.
- Not overdone?<eos> - Just right.<eos> You enjoy throwing yourself into life, Rafael.<eos> You feel driven by great ideals and noble undertakings.<eos> Your open mind gives you a global outlook on life.<eos> You'll be my guests, next time.<eos> Wait until you taste my caviar.<eos> Florence will serve her specialty: vodka and aquavit.<eos> Your sensibility is in harmony with your humanitarian conscience.<eos> But if you want to discard preconceptions, you must replace them with a personal code of ethics, Rafael.
I'm going to take your scraps and feed them to my dog.<eos> How about that, Anya?<eos> Am I showing enough respect - for the dead?<eos> - Stop it!<eos> And when he's nothing but bones, I'm going to take him all apart and use him for book ends.<eos> Or maybe a soup ladle, or a mobile.<eos> Anything that comes to mind.<eos> - Stop talking like that.<eos> - Why? I'm going to get a big kick out of it.<eos> And I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll take all the bones and I'll paint them and use them for Chrismas decorations, hmm?
Shall we go back to work?<eos> Lisa.<eos> All keepers and handlers, attention.<eos> Attention!<eos> All keepers and handlers.<eos> There is $50,000 worth of apes in jeopardy.<eos> Get them out of here... alive!<eos> Yes.<eos> Commander, I understand the situation.<eos> Assemble as large a force as you can and follow them.
That'll show him, 'cause he usually gets everyone he wants.<eos> He can get this one, too, but not on the first night.<eos> Good night, lady.<eos> - Good night, Billie.<eos> - Good night, Jerry.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> You don't like gardenias?<eos> They're okay.<eos> So?<eos> So you don't put them on just to go to someone's apartment... for a late-night supper.
And I'm still starving.<eos> And I'm going to eat them all before I go to sleepy.<eos> Good.<eos> Smells delicious, Babs!<eos> Thank you, Cotton.<eos> In should.<eos> I warmed it up when I was downtown today... in my own little oven.<eos> Babs, where do eggs come from?<eos> From little chickens, Mama.<eos> They lay them, and we eat them.
Or should I start calling you ""Connie"" now?<eos> ls that what you'd like?<eos> !<eos> No, Connie!<eos> Stop hitting me!<eos> I didn't do anything to you!<eos> I was just here by myself... and I get feeling funny when I'm alone!<eos> Those girls are down there, don't forget!<eos> And I can't stand being in the same house with them !<eos> If I sit downstairs, I can hear them screaming... screaming and crying, and then I get all nervous.
You can open the champagne but not just for me.<eos> I'll have one with you but you have to put me to bed if I dance naked.<eos> This is gonna be great.<eos> I've got a terrific rapport with Linda.<eos> I hate to see her depressed.<eos> It's gonna be a nice, cosy evening in.<eos> Build a little fire.<eos> I'll get some candles, set up some atmosphere.<eos> Open the champagne.<eos> Women are suckers for champagne, it makes them crazy.
You didn't even examine her.<eos> Oh, shoot me, Mike.<eos> For chrissake, just shoot me.<eos> You see how sick she is?<eos> I'll tell you what this is.<eos> It's food poisoning, that's what.<eos> How is she gonna swallow pills when she can't even swallow water?<eos> They're suppositories, Mr. Rogo.<eos> You don't swallow them.<eos> What do you do with them?
The Madonna of Childbirth.<eos> But I never saw her.<eos> Theresheis !<eos> In1460,thecommunity peasant of Monterchi ... orderedthatMadonna to Piero della Francesca<eos> Theauthorsof theorder were not mess i .../ orprinces,or bankers.<eos> Itmaybe thatinitially... Pierohasdonethe work a little lightly.<eos> Nevertheless ... here's the miracle of sweet peasant teenager ... noble as the daughter of a king.<eos> The silence of the field around them is so complete!<eos> So far it must have been fun ... talking to their pets.<eos> Call them by name e. ..
Two by two they walk between the cypress-trees and the black myrtles, and each has a slave to tend it.<eos> Sometimes they fly across the trees and anon they couch in the grass, and round the pools of the water. There are not in all the world birds so wonderful.<eos> In the whole world there is no king who has birds so wonderful.<eos> Cæsar himself has no birds so fair as my birds.<eos> They will follow thee whithersoever thou goest, Salome. and in the midst of them thou wilt be like... like unto the moon in a cloud...<eos> in the midst of a great white cloud. I have but a hundred, I will give them all to thee.<eos> Thou art not listening to me<eos> I am altogether calm.<eos> I have a collar of pearls, set in four rows. They are like unto moons chained with rays of silver. They are even as half a hundred moons caught in a golden net.<eos> They have rested on the ivory breast of a queen. When thou wearest them Thou shalt be as fair as a queen.
August 23-- fell off near budleigh salterton.<eos> ...and the pump got caught in my trouser leg...<eos> And that's how they were damaged.<eos> The eggs-- you remember<eos> The hard-boiled eggs I was telling you about.<eos> They were in a tupperware container-- Reputedly self-sealing Which fell open upon contact<eos> The b-489, the dawlish road.<eos> That shouldn't happen to a self-sealing container Now, should it?<eos> What do you keep your hard-boiled eggs in?<eos> I think in future I will lash them to the handlebars with adhesive tape!
Why do you ask?<eos> I'd like to have had a kick at it too.<eos> Mr. Omi...<eos> Haven't you got a girlfriend?<eos> Why do you ask that?<eos> I play football because the ball's big.<eos> Baseball is more virile than ping pong because the ball's bigger.<eos> But a football is bigger still.<eos> The bigger it is, the more virile it is.<eos> A word about cigarettes - they call them "Peace."
You see, we emigrants want to marry an Italian woman... because she's obedient, beautiful, sweet and caring... and, excuse my language, when an Italian girl comes directly from her hometown,<eos> - you're sure she's still a virgin!<eos> - How long have you been abroad?<eos> - Twenty years!<eos> - I can tell!<eos> Why?<eos> Has anything changed?<eos> Nowadays, girls work in factories.<eos> They won't stay locked up in their houses!<eos> When they're alone in the city, they find someone saying one thing, someone else saying another, they start to get scared... and, ignorant as they are, they don't realize what can happen to them.
When you're born miserable everything goes bad.<eos> They also wounded him at the leg.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> Why is it your fault?<eos> Why?<eos> I shouldn't go to the hospital.<eos> I should have stayed out to work for him, to rot.<eos> You too, the evil you got, that's my fault, too.<eos> But when someone has many faults...<eos> Is it possible that she has them for real?
You catch the clap, you'll wish you hadn't drunk nothing.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> We'll see you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - So long.<eos> Hey, wake up!<eos> We're back.<eos> My stomach don't feel so good.<eos> Got any more Tums?<eos> You ate them all before we got to San Antonio.
You belong here at Malpertuis.<eos> You have to take my place at Malpertuis.<eos> Very soon you will be master here, Lad.<eos> Master of a world.<eos> A universe.<eos> Of eternity.<eos> - You're mad, Cassavius.<eos> What do you know about eternity?<eos> - I know things.<eos> And no one knows I know them.
Loving Euryale is hopeless.<eos> How do you know?<eos> - It's plain to see.<eos> She doesn't Look at you, doesn't say anything either.<eos> It's as if she's avoiding you, as if she wants to hurt you.<eos> Such a pity, when you think what true Love can be.<eos> Here, smell the perfume of a woman.<eos> It's the scent of sandalwood.<eos> The keys to Malpertuis.<eos> - Mrs Kriekepoot gave them to me.
All right, now the tourniquet.<eos> Good and tight.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Give me the swab.<eos> All right, you get the needle.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> All right, take off the tourniquet.<eos> Will one bottle be enough?<eos> It's genuine 160-proof old Anglo-Saxon, baby.<eos> I was a very peculiar doctor in those days... trying to find treatments for diseases that hadn't existed... till other doctors invented them.
Thanks.<eos> I thought you were pulling out of the yabba on Saturday.<eos> Hmm?<eos> Oh, yes, yes, I was.<eos> What went wrong?<eos> Oh, I got involved.<eos> Hey, there's my suitcases.<eos> Yours, are they?<eos> Yes.<eos> I left them here yesterday.
Which shows you shouldn't get involved with staff.<eos> They know too much about you.<eos> You think only of yourself.<eos> So does everyone.<eos> There's this chick... who's stuck on me.<eos> I just have to look at her, and everything's on fire.<eos> Women are pushovers.<eos> They've no means of comparison.<eos> Oh they have a comparison, but love's blind.<eos> The uniform attracts them... and the experience.
I know. I haven't written a line since I met her.<eos> I knew it would change everything.<eos> Die Ereignisse verwirren mich.<eos> Two Rosemondes are one too many.<eos> And which one's superfluous?<eos> Mine, not the real one. I've gotta start over.<eos> I have to know more about the real one.<eos> Where are the recordings?<eos> In the bathroom.<eos> I listened to them while I cut my toenails.
Senator Alcott.<eos> - Is he dead?<eos> - No.<eos> He's suffering from acute shock.<eos> - Sin-sing.<eos> - Yes?<eos> What is this?<eos> Well, it's a telepathic amplifier.<eos> - Is that what caused the hallucinations?<eos> - No, not caused them.
Look, Pauline,<eos> I'm taking your shoes along - I'll sit in the car and wait for you to come out.<eos> And I hope you heard me!<eos> Who is it now?<eos> - Mrs. Suchankova again!<eos> Mrs. Homolkova -<eos> - Didn't I tell you that -<eos> That's not why I came - - I'm bringing Mr. Homolka's cigarettes.<eos> What cigarettes?<eos> - He threw them through the window into my apartment!
- Gone where?<eos> - Dead.<eos> What?<eos> He was alive one minute, then he was dead.<eos> - He can't be.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Where did they take the girls?<eos> Did they arrest them?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They just came in and took them.
I think you're too complicated for your own good.<eos> - You think I'm complicated?<eos> - Yes, I think you're complicated.<eos> Why do you think I'm complicated?<eos> Well...<eos> Go ahead, be honest.<eos> Go ahead, be honest.<eos> I don't like your American bluntness.<eos> Banging people on backs and calling them "pal."<eos> You don't even know them.
They find him a few minutes later listening to the voice of the victim on a juke-box.<eos> - He's an organist.<eos> - Don't move.<eos> Shall we do the one with the revolutionary youth?<eos> A young revolutionary student girl is suffocated by an Professor of Sociology, with 10.000 lira bills.<eos> She is violated afterwards. Still!<eos> - Legs wide, don't move.<eos> - Damn!<eos> - Thats it!<eos> - Does it excite you to find them like that?
- Logistics?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> We've got logistics coming out of our ears!<eos> What we need is fighting spirit!<eos> The will to win!<eos> Where are those aerial photographs?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They don't seem to be here.<eos> They don't what?<eos> I can't locate them, sir.
Do you see this fine thing?<eos> Do you admire the humanity of it?<eos> Because the Human Beings, my son, they believe everything is alive.<eos> Not only man and animals, but also water, earth, stone.<eos> And also the things from them, like that hair.<eos> The man from whom this hair came, he's bald on the other side, because I now own his scalp.<eos> That is the way things are.<eos> But the white men, they believe everything is dead:<eos> Stone, earth, animals, and people, even their own people.<eos> If things keep trying to live, white men will rub them out.
- General!<eos> Don't you remember me?<eos> I'm Jack Crabb, the mule skinner!<eos> - Mule skinner? - Yes.<eos> I applied for a job as scout, but you could tell my true occupation just by looking at me.<eos> Yes, I believe I do remember that.<eos> How did you become a renegade?<eos> General, I ain't no renegade!<eos> I was captured by the Cheyenne and held prisoner!<eos> Why, they took cactus thorns and stuck them in me!
The meeting has been set for tonight.<eos> My sons... Don't take it seriously, this wave of democracy.<eos> Don't let it go to your head.<eos> I was like you. And I'm a self-made man.<eos> And now, if I have some money, and a business, I don't owe it to the Trade Union.<eos> They are the fruits of my brain, got it?<eos> Engineer, we're talking about bread and work.<eos> The fares are already meagre, and must be respected!<eos> I do respect the rates.<eos> No, engineer. Neither you are respecting them.
- Excuse me.<eos> - Just a minute.<eos> I've got 20 minutes to catch a train.<eos> You have lost my bags.<eos> - A large brown one and small grey one.<eos> - We've got the claim checks.<eos> - What do they look like?<eos> - A large brown one and small grey one.<eos> - You don't see 'em?<eos> - Why would we ask if we saw them?
cmoe on .. get it,..cmoe on<eos> come back herer .. wiat<eos> sute up .. you got sick sute up .. dman't<eos> - how is your leg - ... stell moves .<eos> you liky that polet was came through .<eos> - it's,.. my head, that hurts - .. who.. ?<eos> here eat some of this...<eos> ...then you feel better .<eos> - it's good .. what is it ?<eos> I chewed up smoe roots and packed them on your wound... kill the poison , big Indians...
Come on, let him sleep<eos> No need to wake him up yet<eos> What did his teacher say about him?<eos> He was one of the boys who spat on that picture<eos> No one told on him, but when they started investigating he reported himself to the Head<eos> Did we drink to our anniversary?<eos> It was yesterday.<eos> Today is the 18th<eos> Look, swallows!<eos> I've never noticed them before!
You're so nice!<eos> And what is this here? I see a young lady a little shorter than the others... stop here.<eos> - She's dressed as an ice cream seller.<eos> - What are you doing with the models?<eos> - I do the guard of the fur!<eos> Do the guard of the fur?<eos> The lady is French. - They take away the furs?<eos> - They attack everything! - If they steal, they attack.<eos> - They attack the girls? - Yes.<eos> - How do you defend them?
Who was it?<eos> Who?<eos> Who?<eos> - lt's the colonel<eos> - How many?<eos> Another five men<eos> Where?<eos> In the Franciscan mission<eos> The colonel's not selfish.<eos> He uses women once and gives them away
And then it's frightening.<eos> In autumn there are always waves on the lake. And the water is black and the waves huge.<eos> Huge, black waves.<eos> Do you know, Sonyetka, who we resemble?<eos> Adam and Eve.<eos> But it's not at all like paradise here!<eos> Nonsense, we've just been in paradise together.<eos> Thank you, Katerina Lvovna, thank you for the stockings!<eos> Look how fine they look on my legs.<eos> Seryozha put them on for me and kissed my legs to make them warm!
Just think, I'll look nude! Who is that?<eos> - A client.<eos> Can I help her?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> So then?<eos> There were just 2 spectacular blondes, 2 foxes.<eos> Come on! - They were like two "Bluebelles".<eos> One was speaking French.<eos> - Well, it's like the Bergamo dialect.<eos> Dear Clara accompanied them in to try on the lingerie.
- Let her in.<eos> He'll see you now.<eos> Ergstrom.<eos> A Swedish surname, isn't it?<eos> I'm always forgetting it.<eos> - I've only been working here a month.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you but I need more material for my bulletin on male sterilization in India.<eos> I need trade publications.<eos> I'd gladly give them to you, but I've got them at home.
Tonight, did you notice?<eos> There were thirteen of us at the table.<eos> - Are you superstitious?<eos> Are you?<eos> - I'm not.<eos> I am.. very much.<eos> I feel better already.<eos> You know what we'll do now?<eos> Enough with the suitcases.<eos> We'll put them on top of the armoire and not think about them anymore.
Rimpoche, it's time.<eos> The throne awaits you.<eos> Our beloved Tibet awaits its ruler.<eos> The wall obscuring your vision has fallen.<eos> The heavens have opened, stars shine above...<eos> You will save the world.<eos> You are Buddha.<eos> Yes, the heavens have opened, the stars above are infinite...<eos> As I read for years in my book about Tibet by David-Neel:<eos> Free all creatures from the suffering that awaits them.
You know, backwards and forwards.<eos> - That's nice.<eos> - Forwards and backwards.<eos> How dare you!<eos> - Does it get boring?<eos> - How really dare you say such things?<eos> And do them!<eos> Well, I'd be interested in joining your party, I'm sure you can use another pair of hands.<eos> You keep your filthy commuter hands to yourself.<eos> Down the seams of your trousers, where I can see them.
- Yes, sir.<eos> To kill her?<eos> To kill her.<eos> She was just standing there, looking at me without speaking.<eos> I hit her with the stick.<eos> Did you grab her neck?<eos> I don't remember grabbing her neck.<eos> He's lying, the body had signs of strangulation.<eos> The little girls were kneeling.<eos> I got close and hit them with the stick.
You'll have to excuse me for a moment Mr. Fernandez but we run out of tea<eos> - I'll go buy some and be right back<eos> - No, Mrs. Plasini, don't bother!<eos> No, no! . I told you it isn't a problem.<eos> And tell me...<eos> When are you going to ask my daughter's hand?<eos> Has my daughter gone?<eos> Yeah, she went to buy some tea.<eos> Then wait a second that I want to show you something...<eos> As you see... all these things are mine, but she won't let me use them.
What's the point?<eos> Well, you remember that scene... on an island, where they tested an atom bomb?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, there were these big turtles — you know, tortoises — who, at a certain time in their lives... would walk to the sea to lay their eggs.<eos> And they found that the radiation thing... threw the turtles' sense of directions... so instead of heading to the sea, they went inland, and they died.<eos> Oh, I'm crying.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Look, somebody took those movies, right?<eos> I mean, do you think — did they or didn't they... after they took those movies... do you think — did they reach down and turn those turtles around?<eos> Or did they put them in a jeep and drive them back?
Give yourself special treatment.<eos> Need money?<eos> We love to lend it to you.<eos> Why worry about your future?<eos> What do you want more than anything in the world?<eos> Take it easy, but take it.<eos> Key to Room 514, please, sir.<eos> Looks like you've been locked out of your room, buddy, till you pick up the tab.<eos> Well, what about all my things?<eos> Oh, we keep them nice and safe till you get this thing settled.
Hey, there!<eos> What's going on, Sid?<eos> Do you feel ill?<eos> Shall I call someone, a doctor?<eos> - No, it's nothing.<eos> It's happened other times.<eos> Just that this time, it's worse.<eos> I really thought I'd die... but it seems I've lost the chance.<eos> No, what do you mean? You shouldn't think such things.<eos> But I do think them.
I am a teacher, first, last, always!<eos> Do you imagine that for one instant... I will let that be taken from me without a fight?<eos> I have dedicated, sacrificed my life to this profession.<eos> And I will not stand by like an inky little slacker... and watch you rob me of it and for what?<eos> For what reason?<eos> For jealousy!<eos> Because I have the gift of claiming girls for my own.<eos> It is true I am a strong influence on my girls.<eos> I am proud of it!<eos> I influence them to be aware of all the possibilities of life... of beauty, honor, courage.

One day you were angry with me... because I wouldn't read a book you wanted me to read.<eos> You said I wasted my time on trash like True Confessions.<eos> But my life was just like the lives in those cheap magazines.<eos> Marion was the name somebody gave me at the state orphanage.<eos> Vergano I found on an Italian postcard.<eos> It's the name of a village.<eos> When you get out of the orphanage... you are either brainwashed, or completely rebellious.<eos> I threw myself into life.<eos> At fourteen, I got my first high heels.<eos> A man bought them for me.
I don't see evil everywhere.<eos> It is everywhere.<eos> Just look how beautiful my coat is.<eos> It gets bored all alone.<eos> It's sad.<eos> I should have kept it by me.<eos> It seems to me that you're looking at a lot of girls.<eos> Me?<eos> Oh no, no, I'm not.<eos> You've taken to looking at women... and you look at them well.
Please, cut the fuse.<eos> Please.<eos> El General waits in Agua Verde to meet with you.<eos> Tell the General one of us will be there to trade tomorrow.<eos> Any trouble, no guns.<eos> Damn gringos!<eos> Get them up there, Freddie!<eos> Pull them over!<eos> You bring the guns?<eos> Don't worry, we've got them.
When do we get our guns?<eos> The quicker I get back, the quicker you get the next load.<eos> Open it up.<eos> Up the arroyo, about two miles... you'll find three cases of rifles... and one case of ammunition hidden in the bush behind them.<eos> I understand you have a machine gun.<eos> Our contract called for 16 cases of rifles... and ammunition for $10,000.<eos> Not a machine gun.<eos> That's our present to the General.<eos> Gringo, you fight with Mapache... I'll think about it.<eos> In case he don't find them... Go.
You saw naked women there, right?<eos> Some shameless women.<eos> A fighter.<eos> Don't tell me you think they model a fighter after you.<eos> - Please let me read a moment.<eos> - Why did you want to go in the tub?<eos> - Please, go hang the laundry.<eos> - You did just like that!<eos> - Why don't the girls do that?<eos> - That's how you brought them up.
- Why did you want to go in the tub?<eos> - Please, go hang the laundry.<eos> - You did just like that!<eos> - Why don't the girls do that?<eos> - That's how you brought them up.<eos> - You raised them.<eos> - I didn't raise them.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> - Someone had to bring them up.<eos> I'll beat them so you won't recognize them!
What, eggs?<eos> Yes, eggs. Don't you have some?<eos> Eggs...<eos> In these war times...<eos> Sell the coat.<eos> How much will you give?<eos> One suitcase of eggs.<eos> That's not enough. And I don't have a suitcase.<eos> Where do you put the eggs then?<eos> First, I leave them with former owners. After that to the basket.
State, reveal, recount, affirm.<eos> You know quite a few, I see.<eos> I'm gonna keep "say." It's better.<eos> That Mrs. Tabard is running me ragged.<eos> But I've got a lead.<eos> - What kind of lead?<eos> About her lover.<eos> She doesn't have a lover!<eos> She's above all that!<eos> She just bought three neckties, and her husband doesn't wear them.
My group must have more weapons before we can launch an attack.<eos> You'll return to your position and stand by.<eos> You will receive your orders.<eos> Right.<eos> You will receive your orders.<eos> - Long live the revolution. - Revolution.<eos> The door, the door.<eos> The door!<eos> You must tell me, where did you get those pills?<eos> Did an Earth person give them to you, a man called Durand Durand?
Yes, I know.<eos> It can't be much fun... but what should I do?<eos> You're supposed to be interested in me, you fool.<eos> Do something!<eos> it's impossible to live... with or without you!<eos> So I'll sign atreay, from nowand forevermore.<eos> I'll never lift a finger against you, nor you against me.<eos> Now's the time to start.<eos> Music!<eos> They're not so bad, the girls, though I prefer them at a distance.
Safe across the border.<eos> What happened to the little girl?<eos> What did she say?<eos> Five Viet Cong soldiers took her in the jungle.<eos> They didn't bring her back.<eos> It's no use.<eos> I'll do what has to be done.<eos> It's pretty hard to talk to anyone about this country until they've...<eos> The last village that I visited they didn't kill the chief.<eos> They tied him to a tree brought his teenage daughters out in front of him and disemboweled them.
But in your mind you never give up.<eos> In your imagination you can eat sweets, wear nice clothes, and be happy.<eos> So when I was old enough to feel sexual desire, it seemed completely natural simply to imagine its fulfillment.<eos> Of course... you aren't always satisfied just by what you imagine.<eos> I would follow girls.<eos> I would steal.<eos> But those things would spur my imagination, make it swell.<eos> Actually... I did those small things because I wanted bigger, newer dreams.<eos> Earlier, when I tried being R, I was certain I remembered doing those things.<eos> But whether I did them in my imagination or in reality wasn't really clear.
What are you yelling about?<eos> This is a friendly game.<eos> We've been sitting here talking since eight o'clock.<eos> Since 7:00. That's why I said I'd quit at 12:00.<eos> How would you like a stale banana right in the mouth?<eos> Calm down.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> I'm a cop, I could arrest the whole lousy game.<eos> Murray is right.<eos> Let's play cards and hold them up. I can't see where I marked them.
Since when do they have cabs in Hannigan's Bar?<eos> Wait.<eos> I want this on a tape recorder.<eos> Nobody's gonna believe me.<eos> Now I've got to call you if I'm coming home late for dinner?<eos> Not any dinner.<eos> Just the ones I've been slaving over since 5:00 this afternoon to help you save to pay your wife's alimony.<eos> Felix, this is no time to have a domestic quarrel.<eos> We got two girls coming down here any minute!<eos> You told them to be here at 8:00?
Sibilla walks and revolves.<eos> Rochelle brushes Nicole's hair.<eos> Paolo reads "Paese Sera". Read.<eos> Sibilla revolves. Revolve... Revolve...<eos> Revolve... Rochelle brushes Nicole's hair.<eos> Brush. Sleep... Dream...<eos> Play the Jew's harp.<eos> Could we say something's happening? No...<eos> Nothing's happening.<eos> Things aren't as we see them, or most of the time, as we hear them.

"Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden and chained him to a tree and the children did make sport of it."<eos> No, sir, I have not forgotten.<eos> For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets until our lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed.<eos> Keep digging, Cornelius.<eos> You'll find evidence of the master of this house...<eos> An ape.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Reconstructing a past life.<eos> These things were found at the same level as that doll?<eos> Whoever owned them must have been in pretty bad shape.
- Didn't sense that one, eh?<eos> * He doesn't know Sabatini.<eos> Hi, Leopard! Hi, hyena.<eos> I searched all of Tampala Banye.<eos> And I find you here.<eos> Tell those animals to lower their ridiculous spears.<eos> It's true, they're not very scary.<eos> Your guys are better equipped.<eos> Yet I would be leery of those spears.<eos> They've been using them for centuries.
Come, madam, let's away.<eos> Good morrow, cousin.<eos> - Is the day so young?<eos> - But new struck nine.<eos> Ay me!<eos> Sad hours seem long.<eos> Was that my father that went hence so fast?<eos> It was.<eos> What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?<eos> Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Her wagon-spokes are made of long spinners' legs, and the cover of the wings of grasshoppers.<eos> The traces of the smallest spider's web and the collars of the moonshine's watery beams.<eos> Her whip, crack, is a cricket's bone, the lash of film.<eos> And in this state she gallops night by night through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love.<eos> O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream, which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.<eos> And sometime comes she with a tithe pig's tail, tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep. Then dreams he of another benefice.<eos> Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes, and being thus frighted<eos> swears a prayer or two and sleeps again.<eos> This is that very Mab that plaits the manes of horses in the night, and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes.<eos> This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, that presses them and learns them first to bear, making them women of good carriage.
Are you feeling sick again?<eos> How can I help you?<eos> We have got everything here.<eos> Open this bottle of sparkling wine and some fried pastries, to start.<eos> Fried pastries?<eos> You don't run away from fried pastries at carnival.<eos> Fried pastries!<eos> I go and see, but I'm not sure.<eos> I've heard that you were looking for fried pastries before.<eos> I've brought some of them, can I offer them?
- I coulda told you all this was comin'.<eos> - What's coming?<eos> Jim, it's happening right under our noses and we can't see it.<eos> We take machines and stuff 'em with information until they're smarter than we are.<eos> Take a car.<eos> Most guys spread more love and time and money... on their car in a week than they do on their wife and kids in a year.<eos> Pretty soon, you know what? The machine starts to think it is somebody.<eos> I'm not saying a mechanical thing can't be a friend.<eos> Like, when I was broke one summer, there was this giant claw machine in the Sutro Amusement Park.<eos> It would grab cameras and watches and drop them down a hole to me.
- Wait!<eos> It's so dark here!<eos> There's no ventilation!<eos> The girls are here...<eos> They want to see you.<eos> Rise up, child.<eos> See them.<eos> You're not being reasonable.<eos> Trials should be born with resignation.<eos> God sends them.
Since he's your husband he owes you respect.<eos> Yes, but he has a temper. I know he loves me...<eos> There are 28 letters in the alphabet.<eos> - And begins with Z.<eos> - Zee.<eos> Lucia, you're not your husband's slave.<eos> What can I do?<eos> I love him the way he is.<eos> Did you see the new houses? Did you hear about the plan?<eos> I haven't seen them, but they told me.
Cheap whores from somewhere, no doubt.<eos> Do you suppose those people intend to turn this place into a brothel?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What's going on?<eos> They all showed up after you left for Tonda.<eos> - A sudden crush of guests?<eos> - If you can call them that.<eos> At this rate, the inn's reputation will go right down the drain.<eos> We put down a deposit to reserve the rooms.<eos> How we use them is no concern of yours.
I am the salvation of you and of all humanity!<eos> The only creature that fights without asking for anything in return pays for the survival of a race that is not awake.<eos> They wait in vain for God.<eos> If He existed, my friend, I would be there and you would be here.<eos> So it is proven. There is no invisible force.<eos> But something has to rule the Earth.<eos> A perfect... force.<eos> Nature?<eos> No!<eos> It is proven! How long would these nails grow if I didn't cut them?
My eyes.<eos> I think I'm blind!<eos> My eyes!<eos> The light hurts so bad!<eos> Tell Clyde to get us to a doctor.<eos> Bonnie!<eos> We're dying!<eos> Buck can't be moved, now, hon.<eos> I believe I lost my shoes, Clyde.<eos> I think the dog got them.
Don't feel you have to say anything.<eos> The way it is, you see... sometimes you just have a feeling for a child... or else you don't.<eos> With John, I just didn't.<eos> I gotta go, Arletta.<eos> Laugh it up, kid.<eos> You, you'll make out.<eos> Uncle Luke, why can't you have chains?<eos> John-Boy, let me tell you something.<eos> You know, them chains ain't medals.<eos> You get them for making mistakes.
Koko, get some paper.<eos> Drag, 50 eggs got to weigh a good 6 pounds.<eos> Man's gut can't hold that.<eos> They'll swell up and bust him open.<eos> You gonna kill him. All right, get your money up.<eos> Now, Gambler, Dynamite, come on, get it up.<eos> Coconut-head's going to take all the money.<eos> Come on, Loudmouth, get it up.<eos> Wait just a minute, now.<eos> How's he gonna eat them?
It's Ogden.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> - This door is broken. - I know.<eos> - Hurry up and eat your breakfast.<eos> - Yes, Your Excellency.<eos> Like a silver garden.<eos> How lovely.<eos> - Hurry up and eat!<eos> - Oh! Yes, sir.<eos> I ordered boiled eggs and they've scrambled them, but it doesn't matter.
[Whimpering] Did you know that an ant has more intelligence than a hippopotamus?<eos> And that a grasshopper... in relation to his size... has more power in his hind legs than a kangaroo?<eos> Absolutely fascinating.<eos> There's no doubt about it.<eos> Animals are much more interesting than people. Good heavens, Sarah.<eos> What on Earth are you doing down there?<eos> There are pigeons in the linen cupboard.<eos> - Oh, yes, I thought it would be warmer for them.<eos> - You knew?<eos> Yes, I put them there.
- 10,000.<eos> I shouldn't have thought it was worth more than five.<eos> - I cannot tell you how upset I am about this.<eos> - You're upset?<eos> We realize it isn't your fault.<eos> I've been through the law book from cover to cover.<eos> There is nothing I can do.<eos> - This is the tradition.<eos> - Oh, well, we hate to break a tradition.<eos> I once heard a story about a tribe that burned people alive, then et them for dinner.
Damn it, guys, stop fighting.<eos> It's starting to piss me off.<eos> Wait a minute, I'll count them.<eos> Wait, I'll count them.<eos> One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven...<eos> Just a minute, gentlemen.<eos> We're going to elect a beauty queen from around here.<eos> You've got girls from around the world, too many...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> We won't take them all.
Always sneaking up in the dark, spying while you sleep.<eos> Hitting you with a flashlight for wetting the bed.<eos> That's the first time I was saved by the yellow bird.<eos> The what?<eos> Sort of a parrot.<eos> Taller than Jesus.<eos> Brilliant yellow, like a sunflower.<eos> It attacked those nuns like an avenging angel.<eos> The nuns begged for mercy.<eos> But the yellow bird slaughtered them anyway.
Look, you simply must stop asking me to bring these home.<eos> It's very difficult, and it's just not right.<eos> It's all very well for you to say that I can get them back undetected but, well, if something goes wrong, I don't think that they would understand that you merely like to wear them for a couple of hours.<eos> Now...<eos> This, I have to get back first thing in the morning.<eos> That is not going to be easy what with all the hubbub about Grove's death.<eos> There we go.<eos> Where are Grove's keys?<eos> His keys?<eos> Well, he had them on him, didn't he?
At first, I thought it'd been struck by lightning.<eos> How could it have tipped over by itself?<eos> It's most unlikely that it did.<eos> But I tell you, I was out of this room for less than a minute.<eos> Could a statue strike one?<eos> Well, I know it sounds mad, but unless there is some life in it how can one explain those deaths?<eos> Aren't you letting your imagination run away with you, Mr Pimm?<eos> Do you remember its arms?<eos> Do you remember how they extended like this?<eos> That is how they were the first time I saw them.
Because... not what I say, not what all these warmongers or peacemongers blab about, because all through the ages, you will find every time a new weapon was put out.<eos> They say these dreadnoughts is the end of war.<eos> They said the submarine was the end of war-- what happened?<eos> The gas masks put an end to war-- what happened?<eos> They got gas masks.<eos> What about these submarines that are supposed to control the seas?<eos> What happened? They got airplanes that dropped depth charges.<eos> You look through the ages, you'll find that for every new weapon put out, somebody puts out a counter-weapon.<eos> But the nuclear weapon doesn't stop because people are stockpiling.<eos> Anybody that starts stockpiling weapons... eventually uses them.
I never sang a song before.<eos> I mean with someone else.<eos> I never sang a song with someone else before.<eos> This man...<eos> This is a wonderful man.<eos> He made me what I am today.<eos> He did.<eos> And what of the dear ladies?<eos> What would their lives have been without Max Bialystock?<eos> Max Bialystock who made them feel young and attractive and wanted again?
Magnificent.<eos> Absolutely magnificent.<eos> In only two elections, we have gained 15 seats.<eos> Herr Kelmann, the party is on the move.<eos> There is no one who can possibly stop us now.<eos> - I hope you're right.<eos> - I am.<eos> I know I am.<eos> You haven't met with the people as I have, Herr Kelmann.<eos> You don't quite know them as I do.
During the bad times, in the hills, water was scarce.<eos> But we had cases of this and, well, we used it for everything.<eos> To clean our guns, our teeth, as an antiseptic to make the dying easier.<eos> But surely, the readers of an important magazine like yours have more significant things to do than worry about how I brush my teeth?<eos> They do.<eos> They do indeed, Mr. President.<eos> For instance, the rumours of a revolution financed from behind the Iron Curtain.<eos> Yes, of course there are rumours.<eos> There are always rumours.<eos> But Gomalk has investigated them all.
No, no, not without her written authority.<eos> He is an American citizen and I cannot take the responsibility.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> It's digitalis. His usual medication.<eos> You'd better leave.<eos> Mrs. Bennett, is there anything else I can do for you?<eos> My husband's things.<eos> I would like to pack them.<eos> They're at police headquarters.<eos> You can get them at any time.
I've tried everything.<eos> Either they don't know or for some reason they're not talking.<eos> I don't want excuses, counsellor.<eos> I want him found, and I want him out.<eos> Well, what do you think?<eos> Frank Wayne to a T.<eos> Let's hope they think so.<eos> How'd you get that last shipment of junk out of Beirut past U.S. Customs?<eos> That have anything to do with that last get-together of yours at Palm Beach?<eos> Come on, I want some answers, and I want them now.
Congratulations, Excellency.<eos> Now, first, the funeral.<eos> It must be kept simple.<eos> No sentiment.<eos> I do not want the nation to waste a lot of time mourning that pathetic old fool who for so long has kept Svardia from taking her rightful place among the great nations of Europe.<eos> I want the people to know that the old way went out with him.<eos> There are to be no monuments, no mementos, no memories.<eos> They will soon forget that he ever existed.<eos> And the jails?<eos> Oh, yes, I did promise the old man that I would empty them of those misguided patriots who have for so long opposed me.
I just want to believe the people.<eos> We've got to see if the villagers are still being sly or not when they see me risk my life !<eos> But, if you were to die... what would I do ?<eos> Okichi.<eos> Well... if we have to say goodbye tomorrow,<eos> I want you to take this 10 ryo and go along the Tone river.<eos> There's a place by the mouth of the river that's also called Serigazawa.<eos> And someone named Okichi, the same name as yours, lives there.<eos> And I want you to tell this person,<eos> that Zatoichi killed many people, but that I didn't kill them because I wanted to !
Forgive me.<eos> I got carried away.<eos> How is Tokubei?<eos> I barely scraped him.<eos> Must be just a scratch.<eos> The doctor looked after him. He'll recover soon.<eos> By the way...<eos> I couldn't stand that you called me a miser.<eos> Here are the 100 gold pieces.<eos> I want you to have them.
The trial's beginning.<eos> - Who are they?<eos> - The jury.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> Taking down their names in case they forget them before the trial ends.<eos> - (Chicken ducking) - Stupid things.<eos> - Silence in court! - (Coughing)<eos> - (Chicken ducking) - Read the accusation.<eos> The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer's day:<eos> The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts And took them quite away!
Just go ahead and paint it.<eos> Or maybe we better turn down this work?<eos> Really, let's turn it down.<eos> And how am I going to look people in the eyes?<eos> I'll burn with shame.<eos> We're losing precious time!<eos> The weather is warm and dry.<eos> We could've already finished the domed ceiling.<eos> And the pillars, too.<eos> And we could've made them so beautiful and vivid!
Why?<eos> We'll talk about the land tomorrow.<eos> You're a little edgy tonight.<eos> -You having a good time?<eos> -But of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let me see you dance together.<eos> I love to see you dance.<eos> I can't stand these people.<eos> I can't stand them either but we'll have to put up with them until the party's over.
The invitation to the 8th Battalion party.<eos> - That hurts.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> You mailed that yourself yesterday.<eos> Oh, did I?<eos> Is Haru home?<eos> Your god is here.<eos> This house rests on neglected tombs.<eos> Those souls have no place to go now.<eos> There's something holding them back.
- There's no law against that.<eos> - God's law! - Then God can arrest him.<eos> - While you talk, he's gone!<eos> Go he should, if he were the Devil, until he broke the law.<eos> - Now you give the Devil benefit of law!<eos> - Yes, what would you do?<eos> Cut a road through the law to get after the Devil?<eos> Yes. I'd cut down every law in England to do that.<eos> And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned on you where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?<eos> This country is planted with laws from coast to coast Man's laws, not God's, and if you cut them down and you're just the man to do it do you really think you could stand upright in the wind that would blow then?
That big white building near the Citroën plant.<eos> I've met some good people there.<eos> The working class in Paris is generally decent.<eos> They like to talk.<eos> Maybe a little too much.<eos> That's what hurts the Party, I think.<eos> It has lots of members, but not many true activists.<eos> It's because of working conditions.<eos> There are no breaks.<eos> Management did away with them to increase output.
Painting?<eos> Painting, yes, painting.<eos> What are you painting now?<eos> I am painting the sea from a postcard.<eos> I am copying it, but somehow my rheumatic hand hurts and I can't get the waves in properly, the sway of the sea.<eos> I'll tell you what sir.<eos> Place the postcard close to this cover, see?<eos> And then take the brush and do this over the waves.<eos> 0ver the waves like this until you get the swing in hand.<eos> Then make them bigger and bigger, the way you need them and put them right on the cover.
So what?<eos> Last night, partisans threw a closely watched train in the air so smart - that the train and the bridge were destroyed.<eos> The main track is blocked and trains going to the front will pass by here.<eos> Tomorrow an ammunition train will pass by here.<eos> You'll get everything in time.<eos> The password is Viktoria Freie.<eos> That idea with the sway of the sea is wonderful.<eos> Run, run.<eos> The SS train stopped.<eos> The partisans took out the rails and threw them into the forest.
Sit down.<eos> You sat there not to look at me.<eos> It's your imagination.<eos> Will you help me in a little experiment?<eos> Aren't you cold?<eos> Are you?<eos> No, not very.<eos> I'm hot.<eos> The bandages, probably.<eos> Why don't you take them off?
"was infinitely more terrifying than his Mr Hyde."<eos> Why did we ever go?<eos> Well, we went because this illiterate Austrian had never read the book.<eos> What? That from a man who's only read 12 lines of Goethe!<eos> Have you, Charles?<eos> I never knew.<eos> Yes, Faust.<eos> I could still quote them.<eos> I'm not going to, though.<eos> We used them as the key to Dieter's radio code, when I was operating him in Austria from Zurich in 1943.
- Miguel is referring to the drink.<eos> It's chicha.<eos> - Chicha?<eos> - Developed by the ancient Inca priests to calm their victims prior to a sacrifice.<eos> Very interesting.<eos> You must understand.<eos> Miguel does not approve of my work.<eos> He would like me to give it up and become a housewife.<eos> I believe in our country's traditions.<eos> Yankee liberties are destroying them.
Anything else?<eos> No, Colonel Alisio.<eos> Close it.<eos> - Coded locks? - Three.<eos> By colours.<eos> Then we go with the plan to lift Dominguez.<eos> Were the suitcases heavy?<eos> One was.<eos> Just a little.<eos> Not as heavy as they'll both be taking them out.
Thank you, sir.<eos> My apologies, Mr Bareg, but General Dominguez makes a speech tomorrow, so they must set up tonight.<eos> And I thought we were going to be on television.<eos> - Mr Lanier is not joining you, madame?<eos> - No, my husband is too ill.<eos> When I left, he was asleep.<eos> Waiter.<eos> You are taking your cases out so soon, Mr Bareg?<eos> I'm proud to say that General Dominguez has asked to see a selection.<eos> I'm putting them back in the vault in the morning.
Excuse me. I'd like to put this in the vault.<eos> I'm sorry, madame, but the vault does not open until 11:00 in the morning.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> Sitting here all night with nothing to do, no one around.<eos> Must get terribly lonely.<eos> It does, madame.<eos> Now, you'll have to line them up exactly in order to lay out your induction field.<eos> This one at 12:20...<eos> Don't forget to tell Mr Bareg that, as his employee, we'll allow you to deposit those cases.<eos> But we'll only release them to him personally.
Anyone got any money?<eos> Yes, seventeen guineas that we pinched from the English Lieutenant.<eos> That's a fortune in these days.<eos> Now, we want weapons - lots of them, and a rowing boat.<eos> Well, I can get a rowing boat.<eos> Good, and we can buy the weapons.<eos> Can we?<eos> From the English soldiers.<eos> Well, they're bound to have heaps of weapons as souvenirs.<eos> Yes, but will they sell them to us?
If you were on your own of course.<eos> I wouldn't go there on my own.<eos> That's why I'm asking you to go there with me.<eos> The thing is that I'm not available. At least not before 6 o'clock tonight.<eos> Where's the garage?<eos> To the left.<eos> Excuse me, the garage please.<eos> Down the stairs. The little door.<eos> Where are the keys?<eos> But I left them in the car.
Don't burn the cigarette that it's short.<eos> What's up?<eos> Do you have matches?<eos> Yes, I do. I've three left, here you are.<eos> Do you want to take a puff?<eos> This is one of Fiori's cigarettes.<eos> Yes, Passini got it.<eos> Olivera's cigarettes are trashy.<eos> He smokes black cigarettes.<eos> He throws them this small and they burn your mouth.
Spread out.<eos> Bring up ammo!<eos> Sister. Colonel, excuse me.<eos> We are looking for someone who can help.<eos> Be brief.<eos> There are many wounded townspeople in the church cellar.<eos> We need medicine, bandages.<eos> Can you spare any?<eos> We have nothing to spare.<eos> If there are captured medical supplies, give them to the nuns.
What a time for you to fall off the wagon.<eos> Look at your eyes!<eos> What's wrong with my eyes?<eos> They're red, bloodshot.<eos> You ought to see them from my side.<eos> We're counting on you.<eos> Quiet, please!<eos> Quiet!<eos> Quiet!<eos> If you have any last words, say them now.
-So why did you say "Boh?"<eos> It's a ridiculous comment!<eos> Imagine... Boh!<eos> Maestro Luzzatti, how do we get to this "Studio One?"<eos> I'm a bit lost, eh?<eos> Ah...<eos> look, I'm in a bit of a rush to work.<eos> -Gosh!<eos> I'm such a big fan of yours.<eos> But your comments are so witty, do you write them down or just pull them out of a hat?
He can be a person yet, it'll take time.<eos> Too much time!<eos> We could have made it.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> It ain't all that easy, son....<eos> You're gonna have to walk a bit, where you're goin'.<eos> I mean you're gonna find it kind of hard to drive without any keys.<eos> Where's the keys, old man?<eos> Old man, give me the keys!<eos> I threw them away.
- That's enough of that.<eos> If you have a charge to make, make it.<eos> Come on. We haven't got all night.<eos> It's my month on cookhouse detail, and today we had 184 to cook for.<eos> - He's me best mate, and I trusted him.<eos> - I never touched a grain. I swear.<eos> When I got back, we were short two blokes' rations.<eos> - I know, but I never touched it.<eos> - Were they short?<eos> - Sir, I never touched them.
I don't think I really...<eos> - You said you did.<eos> - Did I?<eos> - What about the cases?<eos> - Why don't you go?<eos> - Me?<eos> - If you're going, why don't you go?<eos> - Let's go for a walk.<eos> - What about the cases?<eos> - Why don't you carry them?
- If you're going, why don't you go?<eos> - Let's go for a walk.<eos> - What about the cases?<eos> - Why don't you carry them?<eos> - Her?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - She can't carry them.<eos> - She's already carried them here.<eos> - She can't carry them!<eos> Why don't you carry them?
Now, those aren't legal or medical terms.<eos> Good and evil are theological concepts.<eos> The only thing that matters in psychiatry, Mr. Stillwell, is behavior.<eos> Can you tell me of any behavior which might make you doubt your rationality?<eos> Well, among other things, I walked down four flights of stairs which weren't there.<eos> Good!<eos> Marvelous!<eos> Had you been drinking? No.<eos> No. Taking drugs?<eos> Then either the stairs were there, or you didn't walk down them.
Who is it?<eos> Josephson!<eos> What do you want?<eos> I'm sorry you're having trouble, baby.<eos> You deserve better.<eos> And you don't have to worry about me, killing isn't my job.<eos> There are plenty of people to do that.<eos> What is your job?<eos> Following instructions.<eos> Please believe me, David, sometimes I don't like my instructions, but I follow them.
He takes the call-up cards to every Jew.<eos> But I didn't tip him for bringing mine.<eos> I... I don't get it.<eos> You are a clever man, Mr. Katz.<eos> What's happening?<eos> I am not clever - and this hasn't been sudden.<eos> I don't know... I don't understand.<eos> But I'm sure of one thing:<eos> when the laws go against innocent people - that's the end!<eos> The end of those who passed them.
Here ?<eos> There's never been a book li ke that here.<eos> Demons again ?<eos> They are tiring , I admit.<eos> U nfortunately, the world is full of them .<eos> I ncantations stop their mischief.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> Don't you believe in incantations then ?<eos> No. What if I prove it ?<eos> Only if I can perform them myself. Go on , senor.
- That's me.<eos> - Well, well.<eos> - Well what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Now you do.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She took the afternoon off.<eos> In the advertising business... we have... women artists to do window-dressing, etc.<eos> Somebody has to supervise them, assign them work give them an afternoon off.
Besides, Gregor Hoffman, though he lived an obscure life, was a world famous chemist.<eos> You don't ask a famous chemist the formula for salt. But Ostrer did.<eos> You had everyone fooled but Ostrer.<eos> He knew you weren't the real Hoffman, so he died, too. That tone is surprisingly juvenile, Mr. Barrett.<eos> I believe that hundreds of people might have died in Florida.<eos> This afternoon when I was interrogating you, you heard Cavanaugh say that. Ainsley was our man. Then you knew what to do.<eos> Somehow you made two telephone calls. One to your boys to pick up the flasks where you had to leave them in the stream and the other to the General. So you could give us your ultimatum on Los Angeles.<eos> Use the name C.R. Ainsley so he would drop the road blocks and you could get out, and he fell for it.<eos> That's correct.<eos> I didn't make the telephone calls somehow, Mr. Barrett. I made them from Station Three.
Stop it!<eos> One more word and I'll never come to your place.<eos> Harumi!<eos> Where did Harumi go?<eos> Reporting for service, sir!<eos> - Bring me some water.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I may be tough, but tonight I'm really exhausted.<eos> Mikami, remember this:<eos> Women get really hot if you keep them waiting.
You keep it.<eos> No, a lot of the places that I go it wouldn't fit in.<eos> All right, I'll keep it.<eos> But it's yours whenever you want it back.<eos> These are yours, too.<eos> They weren't meant for an outsider, but Katie wanted me to know about you.<eos> _ I don't mind.<eos> _ You stopped writing so long ago.<eos> She would read your old letters as if they'd just come.<eos> Then she gave them to me to read.
If you'll feel better.<eos> Yes, you see, the sky was so blue today... ... andeverythingwassogreenand fragrant, I had to be a part of it.<eos> The Untersberg led me higher like it wanted me to go through the clouds.<eos> Suppose darkness had come and you were lost?<eos> Mother, I could never be lost up there.<eos> That's my mountain.<eos> I was brought up on it.<eos> It was the mountain that led me to you.<eos> When I was a child, I would come down and climb a tree... ... andlookin yourgarden.<eos> I'd see the sisters at work and hear them sing.
- Look, what it's doing to me<eos> Did you read about that Dutch paratrooper who dropped from a height of 3,000 metres without a parachute and fell into some cotton?<eos> Nothing happened to him 3,000 metres? That's strange<eos> Well, if he fell into cotton, it's possible<eos> I've jumped once from at least three times this height<eos> Something like from the first floor, but no cotton on the ground, just concrete<eos> That was quite a bang, when I fell...<eos> - My feet were all bloody<eos> - What kind of shoes did you have?<eos> The shoes were all right, but I was holding them in my hands
My luck is the greatest there is.<eos> If I do not succeed, I will not kill myself.<eos> I will return to Paris.<eos> The living dead. I will continue doing what I have done.<eos> No one will know.<eos> How difficult!<eos> How to attack this fortress?<eos> It seems impregnable, all of a sudden.<eos> Words exist somewhere, hidden, for the moment.<eos> But I know them all.
I've got a gammy leg. Gone. Shot off.<eos> Come over here.<eos> The Redcoats are coming.<eos> It will produce a mass of radioactive fallout.<eos> In ten months the earth's surface will be as dead as the moon.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Our studies show that any fallout is safe after two weeks.<eos> You've obviously never heard of cobalt chlorium G.<eos> It has a radioactive half-life of 93 years.<eos> If you take 50 H-bombs and jacket them with cobalt chlorium G., when they are exploded, they will produce a doomsday shroud.
That's fine.<eos> 37 degrees.<eos> Almost like a fever.<eos> Come out!<eos> He heard us.<eos> Maestro.<eos> What do you pay?<eos> For such a scarecrow?<eos> I've packed Luja's things.<eos> Shall I bring them over?
I know another funny story, about Bellman. Ask him!<eos> Come, let's go ask him.<eos> Do you know what time it is?<eos> You cannot be so drunk that you've forget all about time.<eos> Join us.<eos> We'll deliver the money now.<eos> You needed money.<eos> There is 20 crowns too much.<eos> Give it to Steva.<eos> She's fixed them for you.
Because they were Turks or Bulgarians.<eos> That's the rotten damn fool I was.<eos> Now I look at a man, any man, and I say, "He is good.<eos> He is bad."<eos> What do I care if he's Greek or Turk?<eos> As I get older, I swear by the bread I eat.<eos> I even stop asking that.<eos> Good or bad, what is the difference?<eos> They all end up the same way food for worms.<eos> And as for women, you make fun of me that I love them.
- Put it like this.<eos> The bandages...<eos> Wait a minute. - While I blindfold you.<eos> - Me?<eos> - But I won't see it!<eos> - You don't have to see it!<eos> Sort of like an operation...<eos> I must blindfold you.<eos> The bandages where they are?<eos> Where did I put them?
Is that you, Diana?<eos> - Yes, darling.<eos> - Are you finished?<eos> - Yes, nearly. What happened? Did they make the deal?<eos> Looks like it.<eos> They're waiting for you in the lawyer's office.<eos> 200 million in cash and the rest in promissory notes.<eos> And, Mimi... the print shop is asking me what we want on our invitations.<eos> No, it's urgent, Mimi.<eos> At the latest, our friends will get them after we're married.
They're made out of cigarette ends taken out of the gutters.<eos> Have one of mine.<eos> English, imported, in an airtight tin.<eos> It's my one luxury in life.<eos> Yes, thank you, I will, since you've thrown mine away.<eos> Well... ..I'm going to tell you something about yourself, Miss Jelkes.<eos> You are a lady, a real one and a great one.<eos> What have I done to merit that compliment from you?<eos> Well, you took out your cigarettes, found out you only had two left.<eos> You can't afford to buy another pack of even that cheap brand... ..and so you put them away for later, right?
- The wives.<eos> - Yes, but the official wives.<eos> We don't have an average divorce yet.<eos> - Terrible Sunday, wasn't it? - No!<eos> - Come on...<eos> - There are so many in a year.<eos> - It's a shame, though.<eos> We spend such little time together, to ruin even one...<eos> Don't worry about it, the only ones that matter are during the holidays.<eos> New Years, Easter... this year we'll spend them together, won't we?
- Let's go back to the earlier one.<eos> - Keeping the deletion in mind.<eos> Do they have to hammer right now?<eos> They gave us a "clear" signal.<eos> Could they be quiet for a while?<eos> Is someone hanging in the air above us with a hammer?<eos> Where were we?<eos> "Over there."<eos> When rehearsing, the actors don't act it out fully.<eos> They only mark their lines, just deliver them straight.
Those policemen are not honest, and the judge... He offered to divide my new possessions with me.<eos> Then when I declined, they all helped themselves.<eos> The judge particularly wanted the little rug.<eos> The law in this country needs considerable reform.<eos> Look, I'll show you what I have left.<eos> Nothing, you see?<eos> Nothing.<eos> But there are some coins missing.<eos> About six of them, by my estimate.<eos> I came to the conclusion that you had swallowed them.
Smile at the camera.<eos> - Ready, girls?<eos> Go on, Danny! Give us an autograph!<eos> He's dozed off.<eos> - Hey, got those things for you.<eos> - What? - What things?<eos> - Passion pills.<eos> - What I said I'd get for you.<eos> - Let us have a look.<eos> - Where'd you get them?

Or are you?<eos> Immodestly, perhaps, no.<eos> You've seen my brother and listened to him?<eos> And that truly evil man to whom he belongs?<eos> Yes.<eos> Shall we agree upon what Rome really wants has always wanted of Egypt?<eos> Corn, grain, treasure.<eos> It's the old story.<eos> Roman greatness built upon Egyptian riches.<eos> You shall have them.

Call it what you like, but you attract them.<eos> I'm awkward, inept.<eos> The sensitivity was in my heart, not my hands.<eos> When you care about people, Milou, they're nice.<eos> They give you everything.<eos> Love.<eos> Money.<eos> You must make people feel you want them and that you'll hold on to them.<eos> You're sensitive, Milou, but you don't want them.<eos> I don't love them.

- I mean Dudley keeps the gates locked.<eos> We could always break out.<eos> I have a key to the gate anytime you want it.<eos> - I wouldn't dream of leaving.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Adventurers all.<eos> But you mustn't expect every night to be Halloween.<eos> Psychic phenomena are subject to certain laws.<eos> And just what are these laws?<eos> You won't know until you break them.
- No.<eos> This may be something I ought to know about.<eos> José and Jesse are keeping off the buzzards.<eos> Stay out of those berries, they're for the pie.<eos> Let's not stand around.<eos> I got things to do.<eos> Watch that cigarette ash, it's going in the pot.<eos> I'll go bring the pick-up around.<eos> How come you always run over my zinnias?<eos> I've been trying to get them to come up.
- Yes, sir, they're done.<eos> You got the worst thing you could have.<eos> - And there's no cure at all?<eos> - Not that we know of.<eos> Like lightning.<eos> Don't hurt you till it hits.<eos> Your cows are public enemies now.<eos> We got to handle this fast before it spreads.<eos> What do I do?<eos> Drive them into a pit and shoot 'em?
There EThis is a cemetery... or what they call a cemetery here ...<eos> A piece of waste land, with goats grazing ... and children playing marbles in the paths E<eos> There are graves too.<eos> They are not real graves E They never bury anyone here E<eos> They used to E<eos> This cemetery must have been closed E<eos> Then they've all been closed ... they're all the same.<eos> And there are hundreds of them Eall over the city E stretching sometimes for miles and miles E<eos> You think this one is very old because the stones are leaning in all directions E<eos> They put them like that on purpose, just to make it look better E
Yes, and it was such a jolly marriage, those first few years.<eos> We'd sit in front of the fire and play double solitaire and Chinese chequers.<eos> Solitaire?<eos> I play solitaire.<eos> Capital!<eos> Could we?<eos> That is, uh, would you?<eos> I don't care, as long as you're paying for my time.<eos> Don't worry about the money.<eos> You take the red, I'll take the blue, hm? I once knew a gentleman and all he'd do is scatter some marbles on the floor and make me pick them up with my toes.
- What do you want with goats?<eos> - Some of us are hungry and thirsty.<eos> Come on.<eos> Here's one for the pot.<eos> Hercules!<eos> - Isn't he one of the Titans?<eos> - It might be. He's big enough.<eos> Didn't Jason talk about Talos?<eos> Hephaestus moulded the statues of the gods here.<eos> And set them up for all the world to see.
You want to see or not?<eos> See this?<eos> It's a crapper.<eos> This is running water.<eos> All clean, all state of the art.<eos> Good, stable electrical power.<eos> Here's the kitchen. The gas.<eos> Follow me.<eos> All this stuff - you think those buildings have any of this?<eos> You've seen them.
Don't mention it.<eos> Were you admiring the Luca Giordano?<eos> You think painters today are capable of such intensity?<eos> Did you see the Solimena?<eos> It's very beautiful.<eos> The Assumption of the Virgin Mary.<eos> Have you been to my home before?<eos> Come. I have something else to show you.<eos> You like it?<eos> Once upon a time, people appreciated things of beauty and filled their homes with them.

- O, so?<eos> Now, we have pretentions,..<eos> .. eating twice a day, we want to have the bilunch.<eos> Scram, go home!<eos> Go away, deliquents!<eos> - My good man...<eos> - Your servant, your excellency.<eos> - Are my shoes ready?<eos> - More than ready.<eos> We do them on the spot.
- Good evening.<eos> - Hello. This I have to check.<eos> It is not possible, that effort!<eos> Girls, moderate language and move your hands.<eos> - We do not earn a penny!<eos> - Brush, hurry up.<eos> - It always works!<eos> - That we will dawn!<eos> For them we wanted the Merlin.<eos> She has DECIDED to quit and put them under the bridge to take the rheumatism.
- You have the keys in your purse.<eos> - Do I?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> We were afraid of losing them. In Zurigo.<eos> Zurigo!<eos> Ah!<eos> - Was it the one with the river?<eos> - You really are in your own world.<eos> The passports at the border, the luggage in Paris.<eos> - Maybe you got them in your pockets.
- You've become such a bourgeois!<eos> Look, there's a web up there. It's been there for 2 years, I'm not touching that.<eos> The spider, Luigi, is a friend of mine, he witnesses to all my affairs.<eos> He even applauds sometimes.<eos> Ah, here's the phone.<eos> That is a dynamite jar! So many incredible women are inside!<eos> You give them a ring, they come, a gift and we're good to go!<eos> It's too easy with the gift.<eos> Why is that, your wife doesn't want any?<eos> I pay them for half an hour, you'll be paying all life long.
What gave it to you?<eos> Her braids.<eos> Tell me about her braids.<eos> - I got excited.<eos> - Go on.<eos> I grabbed her braids.<eos> Is that when you hurt her?<eos> I never hurt her.<eos> Did you pull on her braids?<eos> I caressed them.
When I was 14.<eos> Look at the way his eyes lit up.<eos> He's got me talkin'.<eos> He's a happy little rascal.<eos> Maybe younger, when I was 10.<eos> Now if you'd just ask me what made me feel different... this story will write itself!<eos> What made you feel differently toward her?<eos> Her braids.<eos> Tell me about her braids.<eos> I caressed them... kissed them.

There's no danger!<eos> It was one who died of old age...<eos> That one is.<eos> - Where's the paper? - Here, as always.<eos> Are there any news?<eos> Yes, Fabiola's.<eos> Carmen, why are you washing your stockings in the washbasin...?<eos> Here one can't find anything...! Sure!<eos> Since you hang all your things down here...<eos> And where would you like me to hang them, if they fine me at the terrace...?
I've been trying to push this out of my head, but i can't. What?<eos> Well, when i was lying on the floor, i heard, uh... uh, voices, and, uh... uh, they were not human voices.<eos> Well, i don't know how to describe them.<eos> They were really weird, like nothing you've ever heard.<eos> I know how this is gonna sound to you.<eos> Don't worry about how it's going to sound, paul.<eos> All right.<eos> They talked about invading bodies, about, uh, controlling people from the inside, controlling our world.<eos> Now, just a minute before you break out into unbridled laughter.<eos> I called out to them.
- And in what capacity?<eos> - Research consultant in astrophysics.<eos> It says here that you were awakened by military policemen and taken out of your quarters and taken to security headquarters.<eos> Yes.<eos> What prompted that?<eos> Do you know, Doctor?<eos> - l had written some letters.<eos> -No one.<eos> -No one?<eos> I mean , I never mailed them.
If this machine works, it will be possible for 2 minds to communicate directly, to share the same thoughts and emotions simultaneously.<eos> Emotions?<eos> The psychiatrist.<eos> This machine will let me know what the subject is really feeling way down underneath the intellect.<eos> I'm not sure i want to go through with it.<eos> Be a good girl.<eos> Take a look at the oscilloscope.<eos> Why, you can't tell too much from that, can you?<eos> Not too much, but in a moment, i may know what you're really feeling.<eos> Because i intend to amplify those waves and feed them back through the machine into a terminal instrument, which is capable of translating them back into the thoughts and emotions that produced them.
No one will hurt you!<eos> No one ever has.<eos> Except myself.<eos> Ben... i'm not afraid to die.<eos> No, you- you go away.<eos> This is one mistake i want to deal with alone.<eos> Go!<eos> Don't.<eos> It's all botched up now, isn't it?<eos> I- i-i tore all the seams apart... to see what held them together.
Just over those cliffs there.<eos> - You see, if you go by...<eos> - Be quiet. Quiet!<eos> Take her inside.<eos> Carry her.<eos> Gently.<eos> Don't hurt her.<eos> Goats have more brains than men!<eos> Who can understand the way of gods?<eos> They create lovely girls, and then turn them into wives.
This is called the middle gate of Thermopylae.<eos> It is too narrow for fighting in open order.<eos> We will use our special tactics for close-in fighting.<eos> And the rest can learn from watching the Spartans.<eos> Shall we keep the men in their own units?<eos> Yes. Men prefer to die among their friends.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - I am a goatherd.<eos> I know these mountains well.<eos> I have come to tell you there is a path leading through them from the north.
You didn't know him before, did you?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I don't know if I should tell you<eos> But if you stay here, you're bound to find out<eos> - People say lots about him - Such as?<eos> He runs rackets.<eos> His house has been searched a few times<eos> They once found opium there in some ghee tins<eos> And there was a scandal about women<eos> He takes girls from villages, uses them, then sells them off
Cigarettes.<eos> I'll keep these.<eos> Give me the cigarettes, I'll break your nose, you know.<eos> Give me the cigarettes, hand them over.<eos> Let go of my arm.<eos> Beat it.<eos> Bastard!<eos> Give me the cigarettes.<eos> Come on, give them to me.<eos> And if it doesn't suit me to give them to you?
Who are you working for?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I was just sent to meet you at the airport. - But by whom?<eos> - By...<eos> - Government House.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> Both hands on the wheel.<eos> I'm a very nervous passenger.<eos> Get out. Move!<eos> Keep your hands where I can see them.
Someday you'll be able to earn your living.<eos> You're too optimistic.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Sometimes I wish I would die.<eos> Late in the night, I take a walk.<eos> I don't think, honestly, I wish to die...<eos> But I say "I wish I would die".<eos> Then, I feel somehow at ease.<eos> To feel at ease is a pleasure you can get without a penny.<eos> The whiteness of the stone makes them look light.
Shall we go outside?<eos> So you hold bound the Turkish desert army?<eos> Yes.<eos> With 1000 Arabs?<eos> 1000 Arabs means 1000 knives. Delivered anywhere, day or night.<eos> It means 1000 camels.<eos> That means 1000 packs of high explosives and 1000 crack rifles.<eos> We can cross Arabia while Johnny Turk is still turning round.<eos> I'll smash his railways.<eos> While he mends, I'll smash them somewhere else.
The Americans, the English and the French!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> What's going on?<eos> You must be deaf!<eos> Can't you...?<eos> Dammit can't you hear it for yourself?<eos> We're under fire.<eos> Yes, under fire!<eos> Those five thousand ships you say the Allies haven't got well, they've got them!
Shall we remove the files?<eos> I don't care!<eos> I want to get to the front at once...to Normandy!<eos> Yes, General.<eos> -Where is everybody?<eos> -What?<eos> I said, where is everybody?<eos> I can't hear you.<eos> It's them bells.<eos> I've had them in my ears for 10 hours.
I came out the other year. Here I am.<eos> We already know your curriculum.<eos> Tell us about Lobianco.<eos> - Oh, well...<eos> So, we made this partnership, me and Peppe Lobianco, soon after the war, when there were no more cars, and people pedaled, in 1947.<eos> It was Peppe's idea. Good idea it was...good idea it was.<eos> In short, he invented the illegal parking, okay?<eos> What'd he do?<eos> - He took a rack and placed it in front of a factory.<eos> When the workers came with the bikes, he took the bikes, put them in the rack, and gave them a receipt, a true receipt of delivery, regular.
- I knew she was no ordinary woman.<eos> - She proved that all right.<eos> - Something about her, purity, innocence, honour.<eos> - All virtues that drive a man to drink.<eos> - What a lift this is for me.<eos> There'll be dancing in Dr Gruber's office today.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Miss Timberlake asked me to return these things to you.<eos> Thank you, Collins.<eos> Why do that? Why didn't she just keep them?
-Home cooking, home cooking.<eos> Hey, get your hotcakes here!<eos> Hey, fellas, the landlady!<eos> Well, what can I say, fellas?<eos> When I heard the knocking, it rang a bell.<eos> -Oh, it rang a bell?<eos> -Yeah, but I saved my hotcakes.<eos> -Well, so you did.<eos> -Yeah, they're mine.<eos> I baked them up--
I don't know.<eos> It's always struck me, the fact we can't live without speaking.<eos> But it would be nice.<eos> Yes, it would be nice, wouldn't it?<eos> Sort of like we loved one another more.<eos> But it's impossible. No one's been able to.<eos> But why?<eos> Words should express just what one wants to say.<eos> Do they betray us?<eos> Yes, but we betray them too.
I'm sorry I won't be able to do this work for you anymore.<eos> But I know someone who can.<eos> I'll ask her, if you wish.<eos> Besides, it wouldn't be right for me to keep doing it.<eos> Although, if you really want, I can continue.<eos> Is that what you wanted to tell me?<eos> - I'm leaving. - Wait.<eos> - What is there to wait for?<eos> - Please wait a moment.<eos> We've avoided saying certain things. Why bring them up now?
I managed to work the conversation around to your case.<eos> My case.<eos> - You want to hear what he said?<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> In these matters there are so many... conflicting opinions that the confusion is impenetrable.<eos> At a certain point... by an old tradition, a bell must be rung.<eos> - Yes, a bell.<eos> - Shush.<eos> But this marks the official opening of the proceedings.<eos> There are many arguments against this opinion, but you wouldn't understand them.
Look at what I'm doing.<eos> Come, Diana.<eos> The day of the great fishing has finally arrived.<eos> The whole village is at the eastern lagoon.<eos> Also Mr. Yen and his grandchildren.<eos> For this type of fishing, they labor a lot, but with very poor results.<eos> Before encircling the fish they clap their shells, and reflect the light.<eos> It's then that they fish with nacre.<eos> Right.<eos> Look: they use them as a mirror.
- We must be joking!<eos> - You have a tail!<eos> - Do not sit like that, it's bad luck.<eos> Really?<eos> I did not know.<eos> That's okay?<eos> - Yup.<eos> - Lend me 300 pounds.<eos> - Want 300 pounds?<eos> I give them to you right away.
- I was knowcking!<eos> - Why did you knock?<eos> Do not knock to enter, but to make you look at that.<eos> Now laugh!<eos> - In the ashtray!<eos> - Should I laugh in the ashtray?<eos> - Look, there's a butt.<eos> - It's true.<eos> - No tobacco?<eos> - This is the evidence. I do not smoke the cigarette butts, I throw them away.
Would it also be indiscreet to ask who's hand that is, Olga?<eos> Which hand?<eos> -One moment, before proceeding, Poseyon should be present as head of the jury. Otherwise we have to do it over again.<eos> -There's no need.. Poseyon has already made up his mind about the case.<eos> That's absurd, Anonymous Metals shares are held by the Garris Group.<eos> They can't crash!<eos> Yes and I, when you told me, I bought all the shares that were on the market, but Garris's heir is Olga Dubovitch, Mr. Poseyon, and if she's convicted, all her assets go to the State, understand?<eos> The shares aren't worth a damn.<eos> -So get rid of them right away!<eos> I tried but nobody wants them.
When I'm free...<eos> -What?<eos> Oh, what's the use?<eos> Afterwards I'll only be a poor woman.<eos> The State will take everything including my dreams.<eos> What does the State know about dreams?<eos> They've never ever had any!<eos> And my pearls...<eos> Take them!<eos> Put them in a museum.
Oh, what's the use?<eos> Afterwards I'll only be a poor woman.<eos> The State will take everything including my dreams.<eos> What does the State know about dreams?<eos> They've never ever had any!<eos> And my pearls...<eos> Take them!<eos> Put them in a museum.<eos> They're better off around that lovely neck.<eos> Just leave them there.
May we know where you're going?<eos> - Addis Ababa. Addis Ababa?<eos> - What goes on here? But, from where you're popping out?<eos> One moment. This is the Major Richardson!<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> That idiot says that you're going Addis Ababa.<eos> Exactly, sir.<eos> The city has fallen. And we go there for the parade of victory.<eos> Excuse me, sir, if I dare asking, but, and your shoes?<eos> We have... worn them out by walking.
Goodbye, Uncle Sally.<eos> Goodbye and don't forget to send that book, eh?<eos> I won't.<eos> What about the weather report?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Snow flurries expected this weekend in New Orleans.<eos> Snow flurries expected this weekend in New Orleans?<eos> Isn't that just the weirdest?<eos> I bet they haven't had snow in New Orleans for a million years.<eos> I don't know how he thinks them up.
I led a quiet life until the age of 32.<eos> Life for me was simple, nice and quiet.<eos> It's good to live.<eos> I had had a few women but I had never met true love.<eos> It's good to live that way.<eos> Love came to me in an unbelievable way.<eos> I was seeking for old items and pieces of furniture.<eos> I was often thinking about the unknown hands who use to touch those old things.<eos> About the eyes who admired them.
Is that it, Louis?<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> It's all right, Fouquette.<eos> You can open your eyes now and talk.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Some priest...<eos> Cognac and sex magazines.<eos> The magazines?<eos> They're for the hospital.<eos> You think he read them?
My secretary has turned up without any warning to take me back to Rome tomorrow morning.<eos> What an excellent idea!<eos> You liar!<eos> How would you like it if you stayed behind without me?<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> Just a simple little job on my secretary's car.<eos> Could you just tamper slightly with the engine, you know...<eos> No, Reverend!<eos> I'm sorry, but I don't go in for pranks of that kind.<eos> Why do you call them "pranks"?
I'm getting treatment right here.<eos> I'm hungry- Take your choice.<eos> Igotenough so we won't have to leave the house till Tuesday.<eos> What did all this stuff costyou?<eos> When you got money, youWlpay.<eos> I want to know, to keep the score.<eos> The bills are right here.<eos> You didn't say what you wanted. Don't you ever cook anything?<eos> Eggs.<eos> How do you like them?
Some men never feel that way about anything.<eos> I love you, Eddie.<eos> Some day, Sarah, you'll settle down.<eos> You'll marry a college professor.<eos> Write a great book, maybe about me.<eos> Fast Eddie Fe/son, Hustler.<eos> I love you.<eos> Do you need the words?<eos> Yes, I need them very much.<eos> If you ever say them, I'll never let you take them back.
Were the flagstones of St. Bernard gentle?<eos> I'll only enter a church again as a tourist.<eos> - We're all tourists in a way.<eos> - Not the same way.<eos> Some people aren't outraged by the opulence.<eos> I'm as outraged as you.<eos> All that junk should be torched.<eos> You, a priest, say that?<eos> You think priests like the knickknacks?<eos> They allow them.
Don't lose hope.<eos> God is great.<eos> Jail will be good for your Silvio.<eos> I'm sure he will learn how to behave.<eos> Oh! Oh!<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh!<eos> Quiet!<eos> The director wants to hear your requests.<eos> If he finds them reasonable, they may be granted.
I didn't need to worry after all.<eos> I'm getting weaker.<eos> I didn't want to tell Mr. Kim that you were ill.<eos> He's not the kind of man to say kind words.<eos> We were foolish after all.<eos> A rosy dream can't bloom in late autumn when frosts form.<eos> Mr. Kim!<eos> I'm here for my lessons.<eos> Let me see your hands.<eos> Factory work has roughened them.
- What do you do to women?<eos> It's their fault, they're in heal!<eos> - Well, I'm no monk, I like women too.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Aren't you ashamed of saying so?<eos> - Well... Your grandfather liked them too, and your great-grandfather...<eos> He liked them all. He was like a lion!<eos> He didn't leave out any woman!<eos> Your usual ramblings!<eos> We, the Magnano, make all women melt when we touch them.
Oh, well, thank you.<eos> I like you, Fella.<eos> We're gonna get along, you know.<eos> Well, thank you. I like to get along.<eos> I love persons and people.<eos> Persons and people.<eos> There's a difference?<eos> Oh, sure, there's a big difference.<eos> You see, persons... Persons are people who have made it, who are rich and famous.<eos> So that, of course, makes them persons and they're not people anymore.
My legs are practically dead.<eos> Why are you afraid of a spoon?<eos> White tongue... Needs cleaning.<eos> But it's my legs, doctor.<eos> - What's wrong, Grandpa?<eos> - Nothing, absolutely nothing.<eos> Mind your dress.<eos> Put your tongue out.<eos> My legs...<eos> I can't feel them anymore.
Everything, you hear?<eos> When it rains, around here it feels like the very sky is falling down.<eos> Almost as if God Almighty has decided to erase the earth the walls, all traces, even the echo of the few things that happen around here.<eos> The town square ceases, then, in its role as the people's living room to the great advantage of the cash registers at the Meletti Café . into which, on that Sunday morning, the important people and we were important, the most important were crammed, like a tin of sardines.<eos> That morning, the topic of conversation must have been the florist's delivery boy who was making his deliveries up and down the town streets despite the terrible weather.<eos> There he goes!<eos> Every morning at 11, two dozen red roses for Miss Elsa.<eos> They're very beautiful.<eos> Don't expect me to send you any I'm not the romantic sort.<eos> - Who sends them to you?
Wait, I'll make some light.<eos> No, not here. No, love.<eos> What are you doing? Crazy!<eos> You're crazy, darling!<eos> Do you know this is the first time I've seen the dawn?<eos> Marcello, have you met my son?<eos> Shall we go eat some spaghetti?<eos> He's nothing but a thief.<eos> Eggs at 45 lira each!<eos> Forget it. From now on, we'll buy them in Capranica.
Yeah...<eos> I understand.<eos> Will you please take me into town?<eos> I'd rather not go with Sam.<eos> Sure. it'll kinda save my face, won't it?<eos> - Can we go now?<eos> - Yes, certainly.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute.<eos> Aren't you forgetting these things?<eos> I don't want them.
Got a lot of years too, and a sick stomach.<eos> Proves that my way's better.<eos> - What way?<eos> - Choose rich parents.<eos> Yeah, you bet that's better.<eos> My folks are so poor I walked New York barefoot winter and summer.<eos> One day I'm swimming in the river.<eos> When I come out I seen shoes on the wharf.<eos> One pair brand-new.<eos> I put them on.
You got a question, Tony?<eos> How do you black out a whole town?<eos> What happens if you knock out one of these towers?<eos> - You'll get a short circuit.<eos> - That's interesting.<eos> Reimer and Josh are the demolition men.<eos> What's my job?<eos> You open the doors to the cashiers' cages.<eos> They are controlled electrically.<eos> The cashier can open them by pushing a button.
He told me.<eos> After all,<eos> Plyne is a man like any other.<eos> I love you because you're unlike other men.<eos> You don't play the seducer, nor the tough man. You're shy.<eos> You respect women.<eos> Don't believe it.<eos> Deep down, I'm like all the others.<eos> When I had money and I was famous, a lot of women recognised me in the street.<eos> I'd stare at them brazenly, as if I were undressing them.
- Baby, please speak to me.<eos> - What is there to say?<eos> You seem angry with me, sweet angel. You must be strong.<eos> Tomorrow we'll be in our house, I'm sure of it.<eos> We'll find a place to sleep and leave tomorrow.<eos> - What's the use?<eos> - What's the use? You'll drive me mad.<eos> - We've been through terrible things together. This will pass.<eos> - Mama, don't talk about it anymore.<eos> Come on, sweet angel. We left our things up on the road. Someone might steal them.
- Yes.<eos> - Who gave you these?<eos> - FIorindo.<eos> - And what for?<eos> - To wear.<eos> - To wear?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Don't you ever say 'sure' to me like that!<eos> Do you hear? You will not put those stockings on!<eos> You will not put them on!
When did you change your mind, last night?<eos> No, it was here, this morning.<eos> When were you given the panties? Last night?<eos> - Just wait a minute!<eos> - Use the proper form of objection.<eos> On second thought, I don't object.<eos> I'd like the jury to hear her answer.<eos> The witness may answer.<eos> No. I was not given the panties, last night or any other time.<eos> I found them exactly as I said.
- I studied English.<eos> It means goodnight.<eos> You ought to do German instead of law.<eos> - Well, goodnight.<eos> - Goodnight.<eos> Dear Mama,<eos> The journey went without a hitch.<eos> I had the compartment to myself, so I stretched out on the bench-seat.<eos> Don't worry, I took my shoes off.<eos> But I put them back on to go to the restaurant car.
But somehow. we chíldren stíll managed to have fun.<eos> Thís morníng. Father woke me at 5:<eos> OO and told me to hurry and get dressed.<eos> We were goíng ínto hídíng.<eos> I was to put on as many clothes as I could.<eos> It would look too suspícíous íf we walked along carryíng suítcases.<eos> We were goíng to dísappear vanísh ínto thín aír.<eos> I'm lívíng a great adventure.<eos> Three other people were comíng ín wíth us.<eos> Father knew them.
- Understood.<eos> - Sit down, Major.<eos> - I don't believe I know the Major.<eos> I'm sorry. Colonel Marlowe, Major Kendall.<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - Glad to know you.<eos> Major Kendall has just been assigned to us by General Grant.<eos> The Major seems to be out of uniform.<eos> Where are your side arms, Kendall?<eos> If you look in the book, you'll see a surgeon doesn't carry them.
Your pulse is beating fast and your hands are cold.<eos> We've got to do something about all this tension.<eos> I'm afraid that the cure might be worse than the disease.<eos> Barbara, you're a nurse, you know it is with people.<eos> They're like that teapot;... build a fire under it, pressure builds... and has to be relieved.<eos> - Mr. Holden, return to your quarters.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Captain, it wasn't his fault... I encouraged him.<eos> Lieutenant... the last thing the men on this boat need is encouragement.<eos> Major, if you can't control your women, lock them up.
The style of this film is not that of a thriller.<eos> Using image and sound, the filmmaker strives to express the nightmare of a young man whose weaknesses lead him to commit acts of theft for which nothing destined him.<eos> However, this adventure, and the strange paths it takes, brings together two souls that may otherwise never have met.<eos> I know those who've done these things usually keep quiet, and those who talk haven't done them. Yet I have done them.
What?<eos> I just saw it!<eos> You did, but not anymore.<eos> You aren't the director anymore.<eos> You are fired!<eos> Why?<eos> Because... I want to disappear from your life!<eos> What a bummer!<eos> Here are your letters.<eos> Did I write all these? I wrote them to myself.
Yes, I could be.<eos> As a matter of fact, I am.<eos> Make sure you're on the stage in the morning.<eos> You'd better give me the money you won.<eos> I'll see that it gets back to the right people.<eos> It's pretty easy, isn't it?<eos> Just give you the money and get on the stage.<eos> But I'm not gonna make it that easy.<eos> You've made me mad, Sheriff.<eos> You didn't ask me if I took those cards, so you're gonna have to prove I've got them.
I wore them the last place I worked.<eos> Why are you wearing them now?<eos> Tonight's a big night.<eos> Consuela thought a little entertainment might help.<eos> I'm gonna do a song.<eos> You need a rig like that to sing?<eos> You haven't heard me sing.<eos> Consuela thought these tights might help, but you don't like them.<eos> - I didn't say that I didn't like them.<eos> - You don't want me to wear them.
- Hungry.<eos> Thirsty.<eos> - Feed the boy, major. Feed him.<eos> Give him food.<eos> Give him water.<eos> Give him a woman.<eos> My shoes.<eos> Where are my shoes?<eos> I...<eos> I threw them away.
Got this for your collection.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I've asked Dr. Hasselbacher for your birthday.<eos> I thought we might go to a nightclub.<eos> Can we go to the Shanghai Theater?<eos> Certainly not.<eos> I can't think how you've even heard of the place.<eos> At school things get around.<eos> Do you mind if the potatoes all have eyes?<eos> I got them at a bargain price.
She dances naked at the Shanghai Theater.<eos> How interesting for you.<eos> What kind of secrets does she give away?<eos> She sleeps with the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs.<eos> What's this?<eos> It's just a list of country club members.<eos> Captain Montez.<eos> The one who drew the constructions.<eos> We're to get photographs of those.<eos> The Prime Minister's pressing for them.
The car is a pretext to courts my sister.<eos> And I'm telling you that courting your sister is an excuse for selling his car.<eos> No, have patience, whoever lives will see.<eos> I have to buy 'the car and still I didn't even pay my mother's gravestone.<eos> Mom, the uncle is coming with the American car!<eos> If mom was alive, he would't have bought an American car.<eos> Yeah, he was afraid only of Mom.<eos> He says he has even the washing machine, the fridge and the vacuum cleaner.<eos> And I don't have not even the sewing machine.<eos> Eh, life is made of stairs, there are the one who climbs them..
- Mild servant Antonsson.<eos> We've met.<eos> - Evening.<eos> - Quiet.<eos> He will talk of the future.<eos> Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet...<eos> I see a light.<eos> Now it's been turned off. It's dark.<eos> I hear sweet words of love.<eos> No I can't repeat them, my sense of propriety forbids me.
Not the same thing.<eos> Didn't you say she was in the nut house for a while?<eos> A private sanitarium.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> She was off her rocker, wasn't she?<eos> I suppose so.<eos> Probably got some fancy name for it.<eos> Mostly she'd have these violent headaches.<eos> And then she'd get falling-down drunk.<eos> Still has them to this day.
Come in.<eos> Pat.<eos> Come in.<eos> Won't you sit down?<eos> I think this is the safest chair.<eos> Thanks, but I can't stay.<eos> I just came to return these pistols.<eos> The major felt that you should have 'em back.<eos> They were a gift.<eos> I want him to have them.
Two and three-quarters, or I feed them till they go to three.<eos> Decide.<eos> I want a bath.<eos> New York market's closed.<eos> We should wait.<eos> - He's right.<eos> We should think it over.<eos> - You do that, Mac.<eos> Paco, go keep an eye on those cows.<eos> We're holding on to them for a while.
He can't go on the trail like this.<eos> Thought I'd buy clothes if you'll wait.<eos> Nobody's waiting.<eos> You stay with us, you have to keep moving.<eos> See if there's a spare rig for him in the chuck wagon.<eos> Come on, Harris.<eos> Beats me how women can go for you cowboys.<eos> Women like the smell of a horse on a man. It makes them giggle.<eos> The smell of a horse on me never did me no good.<eos> Just makes them move away.
The Hansa will be more profitable to the State!<eos> You mean more profitable to yourself!<eos> And you have been bribed by the Livonians!<eos> The money must go to the Hansa!<eos> We'll pay the Livonians.<eos> We will pay no one!<eos> We're not obliged to pay.<eos> The coastal towns were built by our ancestors.<eos> Those lands are our inheritance; they must be returned to Moscow.<eos> Who would be fool enough to give them back?
Listen:<eos> you're wasting your health.<eos> I'll never stop drinking unless I stop thinking about it.<eos> It'll be over at six.<eos> I just can't do what I want.<eos> I have to wait.<eos> Krystyna comes at six, we'll go to the doctor.<eos> She'll get the pills.<eos> They wouldn't give them to me.<eos> She'll be giving them to me.
Jonathan, listen, in Fractured Jaw guns ain't for sport.<eos> Unless you make a hobby of killing people.<eos> Then Tibbs' guns should make a welcome change.<eos> There must be some gentleman farmers hereabout.<eos> They might like to shoot a bird or two.<eos> Only farmers around these parts are the squatters south of town.<eos> All right, the squatters it is.<eos> Why, they'll laugh in your face.<eos> Kate, I came out here to sell guns.<eos> And I'm determined to find someone who'll buy them.
What's this, the hair of the wild buffalo to make me weak?<eos> - Now we go to get the great reward.<eos> - Reward?<eos> - You pick one.<eos> - What's this, another contest?<eos> The one to be your wife, make fine squaw.<eos> Never work a day in your life.<eos> My dear old boy, I can't possibly pick one of these young ladies as a wife.<eos> It's hard to choose between such fine maidens.<eos> - Why not take them all?
Right...<eos> Now I better leave because the nuns where I'll be staying tonight, close the doors at nine.<eos> What?<eos> Walk you?<eos> No, I have to...<eos> I have to... stay here with him, poor soul!<eos> Well, never mind. I'll go on my own.<eos> I won't forget today too easily...<eos> Oh, my God, the keys!<eos> I had them! Damn it!
Now I better leave because the nuns where I'll be staying tonight, close the doors at nine.<eos> What?<eos> Walk you?<eos> No, I have to...<eos> I have to... stay here with him, poor soul!<eos> Well, never mind. I'll go on my own.<eos> I won't forget today too easily...<eos> Oh, my God, the keys!<eos> I had them! Damn it!<eos> Better: I'll throw them in the river. so when they'll come back the two hags will have to knock down the door!
-Could you do me a favor?<eos> -sure.<eos> Could you drop the keys with the doorman?<eos> But didn't you say you were going to throw them in the river?<eos> Yes... sometimes one just says things.<eos> should anything happen, it would be my fault.<eos> 4 And... and what could happen?<eos> say... a fire.<eos> It would be my fault if I didn't leave the keys with the doorman and he couldn't get in. say they'll steal something...<eos> Oh, God, where did I put them?
Yes, I have the keys, don't worry ma'am...<eos> The cats?<eos> The cats are a little filthy.<eos> Well, a little filthy, there.<eos> Damn it! You filthy fiend!<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, ma'am?<eos> Yes, yes, I got it...<eos> The keys?<eos> No, they didn't bring them back right now, they brought them back while I was waiting for my sister-in-law...
Shall we eat together?<eos> No.. if I'm not alone, I can't eat in peace.<eos> May I? - Who is it?<eos> A little surprise.<eos> Morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> I have two eggs to be cooked.<eos> May I come in?<eos> Please do.<eos> Give it to me, I'll cook them.
The complaint is clear.<eos> Starting public works without permission from the Town authorities.<eos> Illegal removal by means of mines of a house located near the cemetery.<eos> The house was blown up with my consent.<eos> I'll do as I see fit with my things.<eos> With your things, yes, but not with a mine!<eos> You could've hurt some poor person.<eos> - We did everything responsibly!<eos> Nothing happened to anybody!<eos> You need a permit to use mines, and you neither had one to own or use them. Nor did David Lena who gave them to you.
I don't like the way you read that.<eos> It's like we're running out of time.<eos> Time's all we've got.<eos> And my time is yours.<eos> I'd just like a little more of you.<eos> That's all.<eos> Honey, it's like we're standing behind the clock ready for the starter's gun.<eos> We can't talk till the race is over.<eos> This we've got - this hour, this night, this rain, this music.<eos> Things aren't so bad as they actually are if we just accept them.
Translation:<eos> "The telephone is in the bedroom."<eos> That's all he said.<eos> He also said he thinks he's in for some sort of third degree.<eos> I assured him he had nothing to worry about.<eos> Go in with Vargas.<eos> Maybe he don't know how to use an American telephone.<eos> I think I ran onto something.<eos> Some love letters.<eos> Go and read them in the bedroom.
This was an interesting point as we screened the film around the country because the purists came to us and said,<eos> "How can you restore a film and redo a soundtrack?"<eos> We'd tell them that the alternative was not to hear any sound at all, or to hear a mono track from 1958 which is... With scratches and holes in it.<eos> Then the picture would've been finished.<eos> The soundtrack pretty much was finished.<eos> We used part of a...<eos> In the mission sequence the sound was taken from a 1958 Spanish track and that's the only sound that was... the only music that was not taken from the tracks we found at Paramount.<eos> When we attempted to run that track the oxide just dropped off it, so there was literally nothing there.<eos> All the original music tracks had vinegar syndrome, they were rotten.<eos> In fact, Herbie, when we found them they were in these square tin cans and we brought them to Warner Hollywood studios where we tried to transfer them.
- Yes, but...<eos> - Paul, come on.<eos> As he said, we will see you at dinner.<eos> Lock the door, Paul.<eos> Come and look at these.<eos> What about these?<eos> Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?<eos> Bardello's hands.<eos> The hands of the world's greatest sculptor.<eos> Where did you get them?
I'll say, "Victor, you are only a little scientist.<eos> I shan't listen to you.<eos> "On the authority of the greatest brain in Europe, leave your laboratory...<eos> "...and come out into the sunshine with me." Women, Professor.<eos> How cleverly they twist our words to suit their own ends.<eos> She'll only be happy if I give up my work entirely.<eos> Is the world ready for the revelation you scientists make?<eos> There's a great difference between knowing a thing is so and knowing how to use that knowledge for the good of mankind.<eos> The trouble with us scientists is we quickly tire of our discoveries.<eos> We hand them over to people who are not ready for them while we go off again into the darkness of ignorance searching for other discoveries which will be mishandled in the same way when the time comes.
Why, there only is one woman in this world?<eos> Angelo, you never forget your first love.<eos> What do I care about that one?<eos> We're through! Finished!<eos> - So?<eos> - So, why don't you pass it to me?<eos> What do I care she doesn't breathe on her mouth? I don't kiss long.<eos> - She goes with everyone, anyway.<eos> She might even go with you. - Think so?<eos> Let's go, the chicks go out from the Mass, and who's gone get them?
And I can understand now.<eos> Can you?<eos> How long are you gonna be in town?<eos> - That depends on Ben Kimball.<eos> - You working for the rail road again?<eos> - if I am?<eos> - That would be good.<eos> Playing the accordion's not for you, not for a living.<eos> You belong to the rail road and it belongs to you.<eos> There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
His name is Greymalkin.<eos> A very fashionable name for English cats in the Middle Ages.<eos> - They were used in witchcraft.<eos> - It was not that cat.<eos> Oh, yes, it was.<eos> You must have awakened him.<eos> You shouldn't have, at the time of the full moon... when cats wander and witches dance.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> They do dance.<eos> I've seen them.
At Okada's place, 60 W for 180 hours.<eos> At Yamaguchi's, 40 W for 100 hours and 40 hours of radio.<eos> At Kurihara's place, 5 W for 150 hours.<eos> "5 W for 150 hours"?<eos> It's weird.<eos> Why?<eos> With 5 W, it's impossible to read the newspaper.<eos> I never read the newspaper.<eos> Do you confirm that it is 5 W?<eos> I have bulbs, but I never light them on.
In every department, everyone's got a lover.<eos> Balestrazzi with Fiocchetti, Baldini with Santoni,<eos> - in "Outward Goods" there're four with a hag!<eos> - I'm not interested.<eos> Balducci has two daughters, and whom with?<eos> Ask Biondoni, how Dottore Maggio's doing.<eos> My husband used to like airy, light colored clothes.<eos> He met me when I was a girl.<eos> - D'you hear the swallows?<eos> - Yes, Madam, but I can't appreciate them because, tomorrow, one of us will be fired.
- What's the matter, Alberto?<eos> Silence!<eos> The police supposes the device was put under the platform last night.<eos> Last night?<eos> I dind't sleep at home last night.<eos> If they find the socks I'm in danger.<eos> Where did you throw socks worth 300 lire?<eos> In Piazza San Cosimato, where the bomb exploded.<eos> - 300 lire!<eos> - What if the police chief finds them?

Winter at sea and mountains all summer.<eos> Better off than me.<eos> Better than you?<eos> You are the daughter of the owner! What do you lack?<eos> Everything!<eos> You always arrive when it's done!<eos> Fortunately Dad's not there.<eos> Listen. Mind you, the sheep are counted.<eos> - So?<eos> - Don't sell them along the road!
There are, there are... and you know it.<eos> Come on, you're a brigand more than your dad, can tell by your face.<eos> Come in.<eos> You can settle here.<eos> It 's just what I wanted.<eos> We're three.<eos> - Three wolfers?<eos> No! But I have my wife and my son.<eos> - And you take along the wife?<eos> In my time, the women, we sought them in the mountains!
Forget about it!<eos> He's more trouble than he's worth.<eos> You're right.<eos> We're many doing nothing.<eos> One more, one less...<eos> Yeah, let's drink on it!<eos> ... to my service. You put leghold traps around my property in the mountains, and I give you room and board.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I don't obey anyone.<eos> The traps, I put them where they must be put.
"Whoever touches the little pan dies."<eos> Hello, Daddy, I'm going!<eos> Brings these shoes from the shoemaker, if you please..<eos> How can I walk around with these shoes?<eos> Who sees you?<eos> They're wrapped up with the newspaper, take them...<eos> Besides I go to the villa on another way.<eos> I would find five minutes to go there!<eos> You have the car...<eos> Who can see you, if you take them in the car?
- If you run, you can catch it.<eos> How do I do it?<eos> He said he was flying.<eos> - That one is behind the corner. - And how do you know it?<eos> I tossed the carburettor to not let it get more gas.<eos> He can't run more than 200 meters.<eos> Well, at least a kiss has remedied you.<eos> Certainly!<eos> I kiss the women!<eos> First I have fun with them, then I get them married to others.
He won't last even a round!<eos> - Coming to see dad tomorrow?<eos> - Sure, now you've even got the plate number!<eos> - Alright, you won't get away now!<eos> - Unfortunately.<eos> Madame, I must study numbers up to 1 00, because buses have big numbers.<eos> ParIez en francais.<eos> "Sei" is a word!<eos> You have to make an effort, or you'll never learn.<eos> Now I'm going to give you some sentences in French, and you'll translate them.
You always say like this before getting married.<eos> "l don't want anything!<eos> I only want you, I don't care... "<eos> But then, the way of thinking changes.<eos> "You haven't brought one penny worth of dower, not even a handkerchief. "<eos> No!<eos> - l know about certain things.<eos> - lt's different today.<eos> 1 2 sheets still are 1 2 sheets!<eos> Even if one tears them to dress one's wounds after a match...
Now....<eos> -Good morning.<eos> -You think you teach king lesson!<eos> This is one lesson you do not be paid for teaching!<eos> You will stop instructing wives and children in "Home Sweet House" in order to remind me of breaking promises I never make, et cetera.<eos> Your Majesty, I do not intend to have my boy brought up in a harem.<eos> You did promise me a house. "A brick residence adjoining the palace."<eos> -Those were your very words.<eos> -l do not remember such words!<eos> -l remember them.
Naturally!<eos> This is what I shall have intended to do.<eos> That's it, Your Majesty.<eos> Stand up to them.<eos> Put your best foot forward.<eos> It's an expression, Your Majesty.<eos> It means put on your best clothes show them your most intelligent men and most beautiful women.<eos> Shall it be proper for the British to see my women without shoes?<eos> Shall it be proper for my women to put their best bare feet forward?<eos> No, we shall make them look like ladies of Europe:
He feels his punishment is just.<eos> He leaves deliverance to God.<eos> And even out of the belly of hell, grounded upon the ocean's utmost bones, God heard him when he cried.<eos> And God spake unto the whale.<eos> And from the shuddering cold and blackness of the deep, the whale breached into the sun and vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.<eos> And Jonah, bruised and beaten, his ears like two seashells still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean,<eos> Jonah did the Almighty's bidding.<eos> And what was that, shipmates?<eos> To preach the truth in the face of falsehood!<eos> Woe to him who seeks to pour oil on the troubled waters when God has brewed them into a gale.
I've told it as it happened, unadorned.<eos> Here, under German occupation, 10,000 men suffered at the hands of the Nazis.<eos> 7,000 died.<eos> A MAN ESCAPED<eos> OR<eos> THE WIND BLO WETH WHERE IT LISTETH<eos> I could feel I was being watched. I didn't dare move.<eos> Nothing broken, but I wasn't a pretty sight.<eos> I cleaned myself up.<eos> The charges against me were so heavy, and I'd aggravated them so.
- Oh, thatJulie Andre. - Yes, thatJulie Andre!<eos> She's been kicked out!<eos> Griggs, how could you let this happen... - after all we do for that college?<eos> - She has not been kicked out.<eos> She stands 12th in her class.<eos> She's a lovely, sensitive, marvelous girl, one that any parent should be proud of. And yet, no one pays the slightest bit of attention to her.<eos> - Thank you, Miss Pritchard.<eos> For a moment I was afraid there was a baby in it.<eos> - What kind of a performance was that?<eos> - For more than two years... that poor girl has been pouring her heart out to you in those letters. And you haven't answered one of them. You haven't even bothered to read one!
- I'll get it.<eos> - Some morning I'll catch that kid.<eos> - If cows only knew how I hated them.
How are you?<eos> It says they beat up a farmer before dawn!<eos> They left him in his barn out cold, ripped out his telephone.<eos> He staggered into a general store and reported his car stolen.<eos> How are you?<eos> Battered grey Sedan, 1941 .<eos> Did you put this on the air?<eos> And give every amateur a crack at it?<eos> We'd be flooded with phoney leads!<eos> Then, we'll follow them all down.
No.<eos> Must not do anything to hurt Aron.<eos> Where'd you get that scar you got on your shoulder, Father?<eos> I've told you, Cal.<eos> It's an old wound I got in the Indian campaigns.<eos> - Why do you ask that now? - What'd she look like?<eos> Was she pretty?<eos> She had the most lovely hands.<eos> Like ivory.<eos> She took such good care of them.
You lose Harry.<eos> I'm staying with mum.<eos> Have you any idea... what's making those officers so long in coming?<eos> All right.<eos> But afterwards, before we do her, we have to take care of him.<eos> What my husband would have said about all this if he were alive!<eos> Captain Wilberforce was in the mercantile marines.<eos> He went down with his ship, oh, 29 years ago... in a typhoon in the china sea.<eos> These three little creatures were with him.<eos> He kept them in his cabin.
- A bigger hospital.<eos> - Huh?<eos> You mustn't bite people, Rosie Wu.<eos> I had to give the man an injection. It was quite painful.<eos> Come on.<eos> Suyin, are you going to town this afternoon?<eos> No, it's my Wednesday off. I think I'm going to dinner. Why?<eos> I was going to ask you to buy me some snails for my new goldfish.<eos> Dr Han, telephone.<eos> - Won't the pet shop send them?
What's going on?<eos> Sarbajaya, what is it?<eos> You know we have no orchard, and I know it's wrong to take other people's fruit.<eos> But how can you accuse her of stealing something of value?<eos> Fruit has no name on it.<eos> If a child happens to -<eos> Well!<eos> The rupees I lent you had no name on them either, and you took them eagerly enough!<eos> You've had them long enough.<eos> I'd like them back.
- No, throw it off the window.<eos> No, I'll bring it back. I'll come.<eos> Go away, away!<eos> Go away! Shoo!<eos> Here we are!<eos> Again!<eos> I warn you, if that wild beast kills one of them, I'll make you pay!<eos> But ma'am!<eos> Do you think we got enough time to stare at the chickens?<eos> Tie them up to the bed's headboard!
Excuse me, but it doesn't look like you're in a hurry.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Go on.<eos> You must excuse me, but you looked so strange getting on.<eos> I have rheumatism.<eos> - Ah, my mare does to!<eos> Have you tried drinking onion juice? - No.<eos> And the mare?<eos> She doesn't like it.<eos> You take four or five onions, cut them into slices, put them in a large bowl with a little water and place it on the window sill.
Not married, but not unattached.<eos> She's easy to drop<eos> A mistress<eos> You amaze me<eos> I gave up<eos> Leave me alone<eos> Mum, I can bring you pocket money<eos> Your hands are rough.<eos> They used to be white and pretty<eos> Perhaps I made them rough
Everyhing is white!<eos> Everything is rose!<eos> Everything is green!<eos> You should be really evil if you want to prevent the plums from blooming if you want to prevent the wild cherries from bearing their fruits when they're so full of delicious cherries...<eos> My father says that you should get up really early in the morning!<eos> That's when Catherine and Margaret begin to speak.<eos> And when Joan, in May, rides her battle horse you should be really evil to prevent the whole France from moving!<eos> Don't you hear all the chains everywhere, trembling and breaking?<eos> Ah, these chains make me laugh!<eos> I will not have them forever!
And if you have children, don't send them to school!<eos> I dunna have any.<eos> - Let them roll in ignorance!<eos> I got a buddy nephew, and it's quite to him I gotta write!<eos> Good.<eos> How old is he?<eos> - He's 45. - 45...<eos> There! This will do just right!<eos> - And what's it that?<eos> The letters, we write them beforehand, so, when the person arrives...
All right. Now you tell me where she is.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What's she doing?<eos> Where is she?<eos> Maybe he's leaving his wife.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't care!<eos> Lots of people have knives and saws and ropes around their houses.<eos> And lots of men don't speak to their wives all day.<eos> Lots of wives nag and men hate them and trouble starts, but very, very few of them end up in murder, if that's what you're thinking.
And don't forget, mind your manners.<eos> Hey, look.<eos> Girls.<eos> Quick.<eos> Say something.<eos> Care for a chaw of tobacco?<eos> What's going on?<eos> That oaf insulted us.<eos> No such thing.<eos> All he did was offer them a chaw of...
I'm not spending another winter here, snowed in for months.<eos> What would we do without you?<eos> We'd miss you so.<eos> There's plenty here to take care of the farm without me.<eos> Adam.<eos> Benjamin says he's leaving. - What?<eos> He says it's the winter, but it's not.<eos> They're all grieving for their girls.<eos> Why should they grieve?<eos> They hardly saw them once.
- That will be helpful...<eos> - We're wasting too much time.<eos> - The code is: "Darling Noris"<eos> - How gentlemanly.<eos> And the place?<eos> - In the drawing room, behind the Toulouse-Lautrec.<eos> - The fake.<eos> - I know.<eos> The letters...<eos> - I'll leave them in the safe.
If we took a plane we'd be sitting up all night!<eos> We're not taking a plane, we're taking a train, on which we had tickets for a drawing room with two nice soft comfortable beds, where, at this very moment, two blondes...<eos> Oh, no, you wouldn't do this to me?<eos> - What?<eos> - After you dressed me up like a dame! You get me involved with a sheriff, I almost lose my life trying to catch a train...<eos> I just know on top of all that, you wouldn't take away my nice, warm bed, and let me spend the night out here in a draughty old club car.<eos> You wouldn't do this to old Bob, would you?<eos> Whatever are you talking about?<eos> I'm going down to drawing room 'A' and open up that door.<eos> And if I find those two Haynes sisters, I'll take them by the hair and with these two hands...
I'm trying to tell you nothing dirty happens in this city without Lagana's okay.<eos> I'm not interested in your theories, not when they affect my job!<eos> You're just begging to go back into uniform, pounding a beat out in the sticks.<eos> That Lucy Chapman killing is a county squeal.<eos> It's the Sheriff's headache, not ours.<eos> I told you that once and I'm telling you again.<eos> I won't tell you a third time.<eos> That'll be all, Sergeant.<eos> Let the pans soak.<eos> I'll scour them when we come back.
I think Carstairs is, too.<eos> That was in school, in peacetime, not in the middle of a war.<eos> Besides, I passed the exam.<eos> I did, didn't I?<eos> Yes.<eos> You passed.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Gentlemen, one of the few real pleasures of rank is the ability to make promotions in the field.<eos> There's no question of your deserving them.
What mean you, Caesar?<eos> Think you to walk forth?<eos> You shall not stir out of your house today.<eos> Caesar shall forth.<eos> The things that threatened me never looked but at my back, when they shall see the face of Caesar, they are vanished.<eos> Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies. Yet now they fright me.<eos> There is one within, besides the things that we have heard and seen, recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.<eos> A lioness hath whelped in the streets, and graves have yawned and yielded up their dead.<eos> Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds, and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.<eos> O Caesar, these things are beyond all use, and I do fear them.
Tomorrow, we'll play the lottery.<eos> We'll fill in the form together.<eos> You misunderstood.<eos> He's writing the measurements.<eos> Oh, it's the tailor!<eos> I'm getting a new suit!<eos> -65.<eos> -65!<eos> Make sure the shoulders are on the wide side.<eos> I'd like them padded, ...while the waist's to be nipped in.
- Don't laugh.<eos> - Why shouldn't I?<eos> Well, I never!<eos> That's really strange.<eos> Michel, come here.<eos> Do as your father says.<eos> I told you to check the crosses.<eos> - They were on tight.<eos> - Well, they came off.<eos> See if we lost them on the road.

Between North and South America lie the islands of the Caribbean, colorful and exotic.<eos> Once remote and little known, history is forcing them out of obscurity into the current of world events.
Why didn't you put her over your knee and spank her?<eos> That would get some laughs, too.<eos> Haven't you got enough clowns, you got to make a comic out of her?<eos> - She was trying to break a record.<eos> - Shed have broken more than a record.<eos> You sure saved her a buster.<eos> You better tell her, Brad, or shell never forgive you.<eos> Alberto Zoppe and Cucciola, worlds smallest bareback rider!<eos> I would buy you spring violets from the little old lady in the Place de I'Opera and crépes suzettes.<eos> You never eaten them?
Still, what can happen, huh?<eos> People are nice.<eos> That's the nice thing about the world, my friend - people.<eos> So, what can happen?<eos> I'll walk through the gates of the city, go up to someone and say,<eos> "How do you do? I'm Hans Christian Andersen."<eos> I'll walk through the gates of the city, and I'll say, "I'm Hans Christian Andersen".<eos> I'm Hans Christian Andersen<eos> I've many a tale to tell<eos> And though I'm a cobbler, I'd say I tell them rather well
You've no idea what this is all about, have you?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Well, I'm the father of the ugly duckling.<eos> - Does that mean anything to you?<eos> - Oh, you're Lars' father.<eos> I see.<eos> That little story helped him over a bad time.<eos> I'm very grateful to you.<eos> When I made inquiries, I found you had a lot more of these stories.<eos> The children are full of them these days.
Doing my old acts all over again.<eos> Kippers.<eos> Aren't they superb!<eos> What's wrong?<eos> It's my legs!<eos> I tried to get up this morning and I collapsed.<eos> I can't even stand.<eos> You got up too soon.<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> I have no feeling in them.
We've been looking inside every cake in town.<eos> Is it all right for you to be seen with me?<eos> You mean, lofty star with humble player?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> But for lunch, don't you tear a pheasant with Miss Lamont?<eos> Look, Kathy.<eos> All that stuff about Lina and me is sheer publicity.<eos> Oh? Certainly seems more than that... from what I've read in all those articles in the fan magazines.<eos> Ohh, you read the fan magazines?<eos> I pick them up in the beauty parlor or the dentist's office... just like anybody.
And the horrible thing about it is we may be sitting here six months from now or three months from now on another case just like it.<eos> Gentlemen, the city is frightened, and when cities get frightened, they rear up on their hind legs and strike out at something, anything.<eos> This time we have a chance not to strike out blindly, but to act with reason.<eos> This time we can do something.<eos> You all have weight and power, not only in the city, but in the state.<eos> Put your weight behind getting a new law passed. Let every socially dangerous sex offender, as soon as he is caught for his first offense, be committed to a mental institution, and there he can be cured or put away indefinitely.<eos> - I think...<eos> - What is this you think?<eos> Who cares what you think?<eos> The important thing to think about is three dead women, not coddling the man who killed them.
- She does them?<eos> - Oh, so well, she does them!<eos> No, no! I dont want!<eos> - Good, be good!<eos> Unfortunately, I knew that my daughter had never done an injection in her life.<eos> Doctor, if you look at me so, you intimidate me.<eos> - Do I put you in awe?<eos> A little.<eos> Who knows how many girls you know that do well the injections!<eos> What does it mean! I like you anyway, even if you do them badly.
Sorry! Your cousin called. Your mother was thrown out of bed, and her furniture out in the street.<eos> She's 80 years old! 80 !<eos> Take care of him.<eos> Bye, baby.<eos> Some other time.<eos> What can you do?<eos> To us!<eos> But I say, are you crazy?<eos> I had pleurisy and you give me blows on my back?<eos> And people call them "merry girlie"!
I thought I was still struggling upright, and yet I could feel the frozen earth against my cheek.<eos> "'They'll find me half dead,"'I thought.<eos> Yet another scandal.<eos> I think I called out.<eos> My poor head couldn't stand it anymore.<eos> The image of the Holy Virgin as described by the priest was constantly before me.<eos> A sublime creature.<eos> Her hands-<eos> I stared at her hands.<eos> Now I'd see them, now they'd disappear.
"trust in the generosity of believers"<eos> Yes, but it costs money to build a church, and that money must come from somewhere; it can't come from the pockets of poor monks<eos> Actually, we have no pockets;<eos> we must rely on yours<eos> I shall begin with the sceptic<eos> You'd accept my money?<eos> God does not refuse the sinner's money; he purifies it<eos> -Do not forget me, Father<eos> -Don't worry, Madame, I am coming<eos> I visit churches, I don't build them
I'm in a dreamy little spot called Escudero about three hours down the line.<eos> Forget the rattlesnakes.<eos> We got something nicer here.<eos> We got birds, vultures.<eos> Seven of them.<eos> How does this hit you?<eos> "The curse of the mountain of the seven vultures."<eos> Of course you don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm gonna tell you.<eos> And wait till you see the pictures.<eos> I'm sending them up with Herbie...
- Goobye.. See you.<eos> - Send a few postcards..<eos> - Tuscan cigars, remember!<eos> I'm not sure Alfredo will be able, on his own, to provide for the whole family.<eos> He will, or in case I'll hand him something, don't worry..<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - lt's nothing.<eos> And if you could send my wife a postcard from Napoli,<eos> - Foggia, Caserta..<eos> - Alright, you write the postcards.. I'll put them in an envelope and I send them to the offices.. I've got a lot of colleagues, in Napoli, Foggia..
In 1940, he was deported.<eos> Very interesting story.<eos> - But it doesn't mean a thing to you?<eos> - No, not just now. - You came in as a drunk, now you're a cop...<eos> - All right. Play it your way.<eos> - I'm on a vacation.<eos> - I hope you enjoy it. It may be the longest one you ever take.<eos> Hey.<eos> If you'd lock your door, you wouldn't lose things.<eos> Nor find them.
How casually? Hm?<eos> Just casually.<eos> Whad you want to talk to me about?<eos> - I had lunch with Daddy today.<eos> - That was nice.<eos> It was not nice, not at all.<eos> Daddy may fool a lot of people, but he can't fool me.<eos> - There's something wrong with him.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> There were lots of pretty girls around, and he didn't even look at them.
Well, I don't think he can be disturbed now.<eos> Just a moment.<eos> Hughie, is that woman you were married to.<eos> - Sit in for me, will you?<eos> - Sure, doll.<eos> Yeah, this will be something now, boys.<eos> Hello, Miriam.<eos> I just want you to know that I think you're the lowest, vilest most horrible creature in the whole world.<eos> What?<eos> And, furthermore, I'm going to tear out every one of your rosebushes with my bare hands and leave them here to wither and die.
Pete, George, be careful when you put those rosebushes on the truck.<eos> Hugh, what are you doing sneaking around at this time of the night? Shh.<eos> I need help.<eos> Have you been drinking?<eos> Desperate situations call for desperate measures.<eos> - What do you think you're doing?<eos> - Moving my rosebushes.<eos> - Where to?<eos> - Don't know yet.<eos> But I'm not going to let Miriam destroy them.
- Thank you.<eos> You're as light as a feather cushion!<eos> Isn't she?<eos> I often carry her when we're walking in the mountains.<eos> This is wonderful.<eos> I should have complained of tiredness much sooner!<eos> When you left me. I had thought. To cut the reeds.<eos> That line the desolate Beaches at Naniwa. I yearn more and more.<eos> The reeds are agitated.<eos> I didn't cut them in the end.
Fine, thank you.<eos> Ask him to come in, please.<eos> Hello, my dear colleague and friend.<eos> Mr. Prosecutor, welcome.<eos> I won't try to hide the pleasant surprise your visit brings me.<eos> Please see it as evidence of the interest I take in you, and I specifically wanted my visit to have no official nature.<eos> To receive you in my office would have attracted attention and, to tell the whole story, at 5:00 I have to be at the house of Mrs. de Mongerond who lives across the street.<eos> I jumped at the coincidence, And here I am completely at ease, to tell you now in the most cordial, the most even tone possible the least pleasant thing in the world:<eos> the interview you gave to the radio the night before last has had the worst possible effect, I won't conceal it from you.<eos> Those who heard it repeat your words, and everyone else misrepresents them.
Are you quite yourself, Sir?<eos> - What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> I hope not!<eos> - What!<eos> ?<eos> The curtains are still here.<eos> They're still here!<eos> You didn't,... you didn't tear them down and sell them.
When I think of how divine it'll be to have such a thing as privacy once more... I could weep with joy.<eos> This millionaire isn't gonna interfere with your privacy none?<eos> It won't be the sort of thing you have in mind.<eos> This man is a gentleman.<eos> He respects me.<eos> What he wants is my companionship.<eos> Having great wealth sometimes makes people lonely.<eos> A cultivated woman, a woman of breeding and intelligence... can enrich a man's life immeasurably.<eos> I have those things to offer.<eos> And time doesn't take them away.
May I? - Enter.<eos> My respects, Cavaliere. - Who?<eos> Oh, yeah, sure, respects...<eos> Pappalardo, you're in another fine mess with His Excellency.<eos> Langherozzi-Schianchi? - Yes.<eos> - What happened? - Yes, the Director.<eos> He's screaming like a banshee. We can't find the file 48O b71, 72, don't know...<eos> Do you eat files?<eos> - It's not me who eats them.<eos> Who eats them?
This is the youth of today.<eos> A kiss?<eos> Nothing!<eos> Good heavens!<eos> In Milan, a kiss is just a kiss!<eos> What matters is to know where he had his hands. Where did he have them?<eos> He had them in place, Mama, I saw it.<eos> - So then?<eos> Here, take this.<eos> - He had them in place..
With a "P"! As in Padua!<eos> If you say so, Cavaliere. Go away!<eos> Go away now!<eos> Go! Goodbye, Cavaliere.<eos> Go away or I'll start breaking heads!<eos> Starting with yours!<eos> - Calm down! You always make a big deal!<eos> My friends' parents don't act like this! No, they don't do this!<eos> - They don't?<eos> They let them go out at night. - How sweet!
- To me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Like "How are you?" and "Nice to meet you!" I can't wait to say them to you!<eos> - Later, later.<eos> Pay her no mind, she's crazy.<eos> - And the parrot?<eos> - Here it is.<eos> Did you have any luck?<eos> - This animal won't speak.<eos> Parrots learn things and repeat them but not this one. It's nuts!
Straight satisfy yourself, if she be in your chamber or your house, lago, can I depend on the issue?<eos> Thou are sure of me.<eos> Go, make money.<eos> It is too true an evil.<eos> Gone she is.<eos> Is there not charms by which the property of youth and maidhood may be abused?<eos> Call up all my people!<eos> Raise my kindred!<eos> Where is the moor?<eos> Keep up your bright swords for the dew'll rust them.
You were about to tell me about Eve.<eos> -You'd have been proud of her.<eos> -I'm sure.<eos> -She was a revelation.<eos> -Oh, to you too?<eos> -What do you mean by that?<eos> -It must have been a revelation to have a 24-year-old character played by a 24-year-old actress.<eos> -That's beside the point.<eos> -It is the point.<eos> It must have seemed so new and fresh to you, so exciting, to have your lines read just as you wrote them.
I leave those to Louisa May Alcott.<eos> But I know you.<eos> I'm in love with Lloyd.<eos> He is a commercially successful playwright.<eos> -You have no right to say that.<eos> -And, artistically, very promising.<eos> Eve, dear, this is Addison.<eos> Oh, Addison, won't it be just perfect?<eos> Lloyd and I. There's no telling how far we can go.<eos> He'll write great plays for me. I'll make them great.
A baby, huh?<eos> Why, you're just a kid yourself.<eos> - So long, Marie.<eos> - Goodbye, Ann.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let's you and me get acquainted, honey.<eos> You may be a number to the others but not to me.<eos> Sit down in this chair. It's kind of roomy.<eos> You like the stuff in here, huh?<eos> Just little presents from my girls for taking good care of them.
Don't tell me what boys ogle.<eos> I was young once myself.<eos> And I'd hate to tell you what would have happened in my day... if girls had dressed like some of these girls do today.<eos> - What?<eos> - Never you mind what.<eos> But, Mother, what's wrong with the way girls dress today?<eos> Is it a crime to try to look as attractive as you can?<eos> That isn't the point, dear.<eos> Men... that is, nice men... don't want to marry girls who make themselves cheap.<eos> They may run around with them before they're married... but when they settle down, they want someone they can respect.
Well, look at this!<eos> There's a wedding.<eos> Sure as guns, there it is.<eos> I can't tell you how crazy we are about your Kay.<eos> Well, we feel just the same way about Buckley.<eos> Yes, he's a wonderful boy.<eos> Well, I'll tell you one thing.<eos> He's a lucky boy to get a girl like Kay.<eos> - Would you like to wash your hands?<eos> - No, I washed them before I came.
- I, Buckley Dunstan... - I, Buckley Dunstan take thee, Kathryn Banks... ...take thee, Kathryn Banks to my wedded wife...<eos> With this ring, I thee wed. With this ring, I thee wed.<eos> - In the name of the Father... - In the name of the Father and of the Son... ...and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.<eos> For as much as Buckley Dunstan and Kathryn Banks have consented together in holy wedlock I pronounce they are man and wife in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.<eos> God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost bless and preserve and keep you.<eos> The Lord mercifully with his favor look upon you and fill you with spiritual benediction and grace that ye may so live together in this life that in the world to come, ye may have life everlasting.<eos> Now the race was on to get back to the house and the free champagne.<eos> The house was bursting at the seams.<eos> Everywhere there were faces.<eos> Most of them I'd never seen before.
You want revenge?<eos> - Stop!<eos> Leave the cards here!<eos> The king?<eos> Where is the king? - Don't know. Maybe he went into exile.<eos> Swindler!<eos> Thief!<eos> Now, I'll show you!<eos> What are doing? Breaking the bars?<eos> Then you'll have to pay for them.
I'm not only his big sister, but mother and father too.<eos> I've been trying to take care of him but I guess I never earned enough to buy the things for him that other boys had.<eos> But he was good. He was always good.<eos> Never cried or nothing.<eos> I'm sure he was good, Ruby.<eos> But this obsession he seems to have for guns....<eos> Well, when he was real little, at first it was slingshots.<eos> Used to make them himself.
Dix, is that you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You decent?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Martha's here.<eos> - Hello, Martha.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - You get the pages I did last night?<eos> - On my table.<eos> I took them from your desk this morning.
It's this way.<eos> Come in.<eos> It's beautiful!<eos> And so nice...<eos> - Do you like it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> There are a lot of pretty things.<eos> Where are they from?<eos> France.<eos> I bought them at an auction in England.
I'm glad to hear it.<eos> Now I'm fine.<eos> A man must have a job, or he starts imagining things.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Today I'm fine.<eos> I'd like to drink to that.<eos> Well, let's drink to that.<eos> - I'll ask for the drinks.<eos> I'll get them myself.<eos> I'll get them.
- I have to do everything by myself!<eos> The gray jacket.<eos> Now I give you the jacket and the shoes.<eos> Well... Antonia!<eos> - Also the yellow shoes.<eos> But I have not even those, I gave them to the doorman.<eos> - Oh! By... Brava, brava, give, give!<eos> And then, I work!<eos> But dear, they were all worn out, had no heels, I don't even know if..<eos> he can wear them.
- 650... 700...<eos> But, are counted right?<eos> - Quite right, quite right.<eos> And this, 750 ...<eos> - Come on! - 800 ...<eos> So?<eos> - I must give you 150 lire.<eos> Maybe, when you come back...<eos> It is a matter of half an hour!<eos> I think I'll get them.
- No space between them?<eos> - No space.<eos> Where were her hands?<eos> On his ears.<eos> - On his ears?<eos> - One on each ear.<eos> Maybe that's why he didn't hear me come in.<eos> And where were his hands?<eos> Who knows?<eos> You didn't see them?
Like Mr. Mason's necktie.<eos> Forgive me, Mr. Mason, but it is a bit loud.<eos> Reminds me of those that Connie used to give to Guy.<eos> She always said, "This is a symbol of our wild and fiery love. "<eos> Mom gave Steve that one.<eos> Oh, Father, you've had four already.<eos> What you don't count won't hurt you, dearie. Besides, I need strength.<eos> - I'm going to make a speech. - Oh, good.<eos> Mother, I've been married to you 35 years.<eos> You boss me, you heckle me. You hide my things and pretend I've lost them just so I have to depend on you.
My friends, I didn't mean to offend you, if you took that as a lack of respect...<eos> - You were unwise to speak that way about Boss Passalacqua.<eos> - Calm yourselves.<eos> I might have been mistaken, but you have to admit that in my shoes...<eos> - In your shoes I'd choose my words carefully.<eos> - Whoever disrespects the boss will pay.<eos> - No need to worry, we know who it was.<eos> - Boss Passalacqua has already decided.<eos> This is your business, I was talking about the mules.<eos> You'll get them back... very soon.
- You shouldn't have to worry about that.<eos> But they're my cases, and there doesn't seem to be a luggage boy around...<eos> - You're the number one authority in town. - Yes.<eos> - Here we value form.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Welcome, Judge. Marshal Grifò.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Do you value form, too, Marshal?<eos> Hey, the cases!<eos> Sir, I've taken care of them.
What do you think?<eos> Poor Edith.<eos> I'm afraid all this is going to take years off her life.<eos> - Au revoir, Louis.<eos> - Au revoir.<eos> What could I do but accept?<eos> After all, I could always decide afterwards which of these two little niggers would finally have to go.<eos> Dear Edith.<eos> Captivating Sibella.<eos> How different they were, and how well I knew each of them.
She can't come help me, huh?<eos> More.<eos> Further.<eos> There.<eos> A bit more that way.<eos> It's better that way, isn't it?<eos> If you say so...<eos> Who gave you such ideas?<eos> And I want curtains for the windows, understand? Silk ones.<eos> If you want them, you'll have them.
Been hauling a long time.<eos> I found this orchard where they come ripe early.<eos> A south slope that catches the sun.<eos> Golden Delicious apples!<eos> It's like money in the bank.<eos> Ask your old man if any produce dealer wouldn't give his eyeteeth to get them.<eos> Would they...?<eos> They go for them in San Francisco?<eos> They eat apples, they ain't snobs.<eos> They'd grab them up like that.
Golden Delish!<eos> - How much?<eos> For you, six and a half a box.<eos> Fig, you big crook, but I take 10.<eos> Okay, Charles.<eos> Take the order.<eos> Mario, 10 boxes.<eos> Hey, Midge.<eos> You want apples?<eos> We got them.
- How much?<eos> For you, six and a half a box.<eos> Fig, you big crook, but I take 10.<eos> Okay, Charles.<eos> Take the order.<eos> Mario, 10 boxes.<eos> Hey, Midge.<eos> You want apples?<eos> We got them.<eos> Where'd you steal them?
- Is right.<eos> - Soft hands.<eos> - Sharp nails.<eos> - You like to make tough, huh?<eos> - I am tough.<eos> Is that your truck with the apples?<eos> Is it?<eos> Is it the one that looks like an Army truck?<eos> If they're your apples, Figlia's stealing them.<eos> He's selling them from the truck.
Let's get them.<eos> - They'll only lay out there and rot.<eos> - Pete, you seen that guy burn.<eos> - Yeah, maybe he's right.<eos> - You ain't fooling me either, Figlia.<eos> You want those apples.<eos> - Standing there like Honest John.<eos> - Listen, you slob.<eos> And you know what?<eos> There's the guy to go get them for you.
Put them all in jail.<eos> They're troublemakers.<eos> They're worse than animals!<eos> They're demons!<eos> They're sucking the blood of honest farmers!<eos> Listen! Most farmers around here are into the silk business.<eos> Usurers buy their production and loan them money.<eos> Mulberry trees and cocoons freeze when it's very cold.<eos> Usurers pitilessly ask for their dues without listening to their pleas.<eos> They lock up female workers in the mills and exploit them day and night without even feeding them.
Come in for a moment.<eos> Why are you leaving?<eos> I wrote it in this letter.<eos> Can't you forgive me?<eos> Are you abandoning me?<eos> It's not a personal matter.<eos> It affects all women.<eos> You'll say that it's useless to fight alone.<eos> That's the reason why I must leave you.<eos> As long as men won't consider women like human beings, and will keep treating them like domestic tools, there won't be any freedom or rights of the people.
All I'm saying is that one day someone with a little imagination's gonna come along and steal this place.<eos> And I mean steal it.<eos> I don't have to tell you, Mrs. Blandings what a woman's touch could do to a place like this.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You've certainly got to visualize.<eos> Couple coats of paint, a little pointing up here and there.<eos> Shall we go up and take a look at her?<eos> Well, I suppose as long as we're here.<eos> I guess it doesn't hurt to take a look.<eos> I'll just see if the keys are up there where I left them.
Oh, when I came and saw her like that in the tub, I called Mr. Harvey here. He helped me.<eos> You should have waited for the police.<eos> Both of you should have known better.<eos> - I was so upset.<eos> - Dan.<eos> Say, Dan.<eos> I found a bottle of pills under the bed.<eos> Looks like sleeping pills.<eos> - Let me see 'em.<eos> - I left them there.
Why should I?<eos> Oh, you remember dear.<eos> His class is raising money for the summer camp.<eos> The way prices are these days, kids Are going to start raising money for us.<eos> Dad, you promised.<eos> All right.<eos> Don't spend all that on the women.<eos> I've got to buy him a new pair of shoes this afternoon, too.<eos> Shoes?<eos> What does he do with his shoes... eat them?
I think so.<eos> Daddy, what makes a dream?<eos> Well, the mind mostly.<eos> There mind is like a very wonderful camera.<eos> You know how a camera works?<eos> Sure.<eos> It takes pictures. That's right.<eos> That's the way the mind works.<eos> Evidently, from the day we were born,<eos> The mind takes pictures and stores them away.
Of course you're within your rights, darling, but... -<eos> Well, you've made kind of a mess out of your castle.<eos> Oh, bless you, darling.<eos> What are you laughing about?<eos> Did I invite you here?<eos> Have you got to be in my house morning, noon and night?<eos> Please go back to 3406 and wait till I send for you.<eos> - Certainly, Sir Alfred.<eos> I was only... -<eos> - Spare me your explanations until I ask for them.
-Come in, dear.<eos> I've just had a long talk with Uncle Matt. -Yes.<eos> -And I see things much more clearly.<eos> After all, Richard is too old for me. When I'm 42, he'll be 60.<eos> Jerry's going to look handsome in his uniform, don't you think? -l think.<eos> -l've decided to renounce Richard for Jerry.<eos> That's very sensible of you.<eos> Now that you have a clear field with Richard I think you ought to patch things up.<eos> I've acted very childishly, and I'm sorry, really sorry.<eos> If I had a million sisters, I'd want them all to be exactly like you.
He picks them up, puts them back in the bowl, up we go again, slippity slop, water all over the...<eos> You never saw such a wet guy in your life when we got to that ocean.<eos> And two tireder goldfish.<eos> But I like goldfish. I'm going to get a couple for the room.<eos> You know, dress it up a little bit, it adds class to the joint.<eos> Makes it a little homey.<eos> - I thought you said you got lonely.<eos> - That's right.<eos> I pick people up and take them places, but they don't talk to me.<eos> I see them get out and go in spots, have fun, then I pick up another load coming out, and I hear them telling about all the fun they had.
I'm not even angry about George, just sorry.<eos> There's so many things I don't understand.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I thought I had a good life here, but your going away doesn't make it seem good anymore.<eos> I've sort of joined your team and I don't look forward to being without you.<eos> When I leave here, you're off my team. Lucky to be.<eos> I've got the Indian sign on me. It seems I can't win.<eos> I've got to start out and prove who killed them.<eos> But won't you be leaving your fingerprints wherever you go?<eos> The doctor didn't change them.
And... Well, that's why I brought him back.<eos> He's...<eos> I'm doing a fgure of him.<eos> It's really going to be wonderful.<eos> The best thing I've ever done.<eos> And I haven't quite finished with him yet.<eos> So I guess I'll be around a while.<eos> Well, if he's your model, I don't see why he has to live...<eos> Oh, Oliver, I didn't thank you for these wonderful orchids, really.<eos> And I'll bet you brought them all the way down to the station just so you could give them to me.
We are very happy to concede Mr. Gailey's claims.<eos> -For the record, Mr. Mara?<eos> -Anything to get on with this case.<eos> -I want to introduce this evidence.<eos> -I'll take it, please.<eos> I have three letters.<eos> They're addressed simply, "Santa Claus."<eos> No other address whatsoever.<eos> Yet they've been delivered to Mr. Kringle by bona fide employees of the post office.<eos> I offer them as positive proof...
I have three letters.<eos> They're addressed simply, "Santa Claus."<eos> No other address whatsoever.<eos> Yet they've been delivered to Mr. Kringle by bona fide employees of the post office.<eos> I offer them as positive proof...<eos> Three letters, Your Honor, are hardly positive proof.<eos> The post office receives thousands of these letters every year.<eos> I have further exhibits, but I hesitate to produce them.<eos> I'm sure we'll be very happy to see them.<eos> Yes, yes, produce them, Mr. Gailey.

- Ah, yes.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> - Your references?<eos> - Oui, Monsieur.<eos> - You know it is only a day or so?<eos> - Oui, Monsieur.<eos> - Your name?<eos> - Louise.<eos> Start by cleaning out the drawers and dusting.<eos> Before you dust, take down the curtains and pack them in there.
I haven't had time to brush up or do a thing.<eos> - Oh, what lovely roses.<eos> - From my garden.<eos> Oh, they're divine.<eos> - Louise.<eos> - Oui, Monsieur.<eos> Will you wrap these roses for Mme Grosnay?<eos> - You'll find paper in the drawer.<eos> - Oui, Monsieur.<eos> Oh, no, you'll want them for yourself.

- Maurice.<eos> - Mona.<eos> - How is your cold? - I'm over it.<eos> - Did you take those pills?<eos> - Well -<eos> No you didn't, but you should.<eos> They're analeptic - to restore strength.<eos> Maurice, you know how she is about taking medicine.<eos> Dinner is served, Madame.<eos> I give them to Martha all the time.
- What have you done about it?<eos> - Nothing. It's banned.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Too dangerous for public use.<eos> In the post-mortem, not a trace of the poison can be found.<eos> Can you imagine such a weapon in the hands of an arch criminal?<eos> Think of the money from the insurance companies.<eos> Quite an idea.<eos> We'll incorporate and go into business.<eos> Insure people and have them die of heart failure - we'd make millions.
Everything, a spring morning, a summer's night, music, art, love -<eos> - Love?<eos> - There is such a thing.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I was in love once.<eos> - Physically attracted by someone?<eos> - It was more than that.<eos> Women are capable of something more.<eos> You don't like women?<eos> On the contrary, I love but don't admire them.
I'll wait for you in the lobby.<eos> - Still intrigued? - Still intrigued.<eos> - No clue as to who sent them?<eos> - No, no clues.<eos> I watched all through dinner.<eos> I didn't see anyone who looked the white orchid type.<eos> I'll be back in a minute.<eos> Scissors should not be under.<eos> They should be over<eos> So I can put my hands on them.
It wasn't proper.<eos> Jenny, you're too much!<eos> Dummy!<eos> You admit having taken these photos?<eos> Why not?<eos> Aren't nude photos still legal?<eos> It depends which ones.<eos> But that's Vice Squad business.<eos> I'm only interested in the models.<eos> I don't know them.

- The stage door.<eos> - Is there a concierge?<eos> - What for?<eos> We're one big family.<eos> I'm beginning to believe it.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Will that be all?<eos> - Not quite.<eos> Two hours of answering dumb questions!<eos> And for me, 10 years of asking them! Do I get upset?
She did it.<eos> She told me they were going to elope. Come on.<eos> The newlyweds.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Hello, Mr. Charles.<eos> - What a surprise.<eos> - Mrs. Charles.<eos> Congratulations, Mr. Brant.<eos> If you go out and come back, we can throw some rice at you.<eos> We'd throw some old shoes, too, but we're wearing them.
-Hello, Li?<eos> -Hello.<eos> This is Li Gong.<eos> Please help me.<eos> I will send someone over to help you.<eos> -Why did you do it, Michael?<eos> -I didn't. I'm not guilty.<eos> You mean the pills?<eos> I saw you begging me with your eyes to swallow them.<eos> You didn't mean for me to take them all.
Could I stop by the communication section for a moment?<eos> Later, Suzanne.<eos> Mr. Sharkey said 0600, and Mr. Sharkey is a singularly punctual gentleman.<eos> - Captain Ferraro, checking in. - Captain Ferraro?<eos> Threats of Hitler's secret weapon are not idle.<eos> It's no longer a secret.<eos> It's called V-2.<eos> It's a self-propelled, pilotless bomb... with a warhead said to contain one ton of explosives.<eos> Well-camouflaged launching platforms such as these have been springing up... along the French coast for the past six months.<eos> Our air force is bombing them continuously, but that's just expediency.
We've lost enough time.<eos> Mem, there is thing in this book I do not believe.<eos> What is it, Prince Chulalongkorn?<eos> It shows world like round ball that spins on stick through middle.<eos> And everyone knows that world rest on back of great turtle, who keeps it from running into stars.<eos> - Where did you get the book?<eos> - I gave it to him.<eos> - But you shouldn't without asking me.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> There are many stories about the world, and when we're further along with our studies I shall explain them to you.
It's her empire.<eos> Maybe someday you'll let me help you in the garden.<eos> Of course, my dear.<eos> I'm so glad you like my flowers.<eos> You're so much nicer than I thought.<eos> In fact, I didn't think you'd be nice at all.<eos> To think I was afraid you might starve me.<eos> Instead, here I am having tea with milk and four lumps and crumpets.<eos> - May I have another?<eos> - Good heavens, have them all.
Seeing whom tonight?<eos> - Miss Collins, I suppose.<eos> - Which one?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Can you tell me which girl was behind the counter that morning?<eos> That's all.<eos> Thank you for helping us out here this morning.<eos> Take the girls outside.<eos> You see?<eos> - You are going to let them get away with it?
Suppose you get here in 15 minutes.<eos> Can you make it?<eos> I'll be there in time.<eos> Kornblow's got to be finished tonight.<eos> Come in.<eos> Oh, that's so sweet of you.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Oh, they're lovely.<eos> Just beautiful.<eos> Oh, these roses, I shall keep them forever.

"These are my last words to you.<eos> "That's why I write them.<eos> So that I can always be sure that these were my last.<eos> "But I despise you now, and the memory of you.<eos> "But I'm ashamed for having loved you.<eos> "And I shall pray as long as I live...<eos> "for someone or something to hurt and destroy you-<eos> "make you want to die... as you have me. "<eos> Who writes letters like this?<eos> Who do they write them to?
You haven't got a heart.<eos> - True.<eos> But I've got a brain.<eos> And it was stupid of me.<eos> I apologize.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> What do I get?<eos> My palm read or my horoscope?<eos> Let us use cards, Mr. Taylor.<eos> Let us place them face up on the table.
My hat's off to you.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> Won't the rector be delighted:<eos> If she's going to chime all night long, how's a body going to get any sleep?<eos> We'll face them, darling. All of them.<eos> Them chickens of yours is going to be on and off the roost every 15 minutes.<eos> Sara, I've told you I want these curtains drawn.<eos> - The sunlight is bad for them.<eos> - That's rubbish and you know it.<eos> - At the other house we didn't close them.

- What you grinning at?<eos> - Oh, nothing.<eos> I look all right?<eos> You look just dandy, sweetheart.<eos> Thank you, boy.<eos> He takened out through the swamp and dropped the cub. And the old mammy gathered it up, drawers and all.<eos> She was so close, she stepped on a vine and it tripped him and throwed him in the brambles.<eos> Now, Aunt Moll was kind of muddle-minded. She never could make out how he come home without drawers and his bottom scratched. Uncle Miles said:<eos> "That weren't nothing to the puzzling of that mammy bear over them drawers on her cub."<eos> Oh, Pa, you got all them tales in your mind and don't tell them.
-My darling, so far away...<eos> -It's a message in code. That night is always on my mind.<eos> The night of some conspirancy.<eos> I know what a man and a woman conspire to at night.<eos> The memory of that night is crystal clear in my mind.<eos> I can assure you the leaflets came out very well.<eos> -It's about some covert activity.<eos> -If you say so. Regards the eggs.<eos> I had to work hard.<eos> She worked for the eggs? She produced them herself?
The Bureau also knew that the embassy had a short-wave radio and was in direct communication with Germany.<eos> No one was watched more closely by the FBI than the arrogant Baron Ulrich von Gienanth.<eos> Although accredited as an embassy official he was actually chief of the German Gestapo in America.<eos> Equally important were pompous Vice Admiral Witthoeft-Emden and his suave assistant, Helmut Raeuber experts in obtaining information about ships and cargoes.<eos> Dr. Hans Thomsen, the German chargé d'affaires tried to win American collaborators.<eos> So did his associate, General Karl Boetischer.<eos> Parading before hidden FBI cameras were the embassy secretaries.<eos> These girls spent evenings in the company of American servicemen.<eos> They were having fun but they were also diligently accumulating information for Germany.<eos> The FBI watched them discreetly, knew all about them.
-You stayed under cover?<eos> -Yeah, at the Grand Hotel.<eos> -Whom did you contact in Lisbon?<eos> -No one.<eos> You're sure of that?<eos> I had strict orders not to contact anybody.<eos> When did you get here?<eos> I don't see why I have to answer all these questions.<eos> -Didn't you show them my credentials?<eos> -Yeah, we seen them.
Linoleum washes easily, just in case.<eos> Say, you women think of everything, don't you?<eos> - All right. You can rest. - Oh.<eos> Ellen, you shouldn't have walked up those stairs.<eos> You know what the doctor told you.<eos> Darling, come here and sit down.<eos> What have you done with Father's lab?<eos> We didn't want you to see it till it was finished.<eos> - What have you done with his things?<eos> - We stored them in the basement.
You think just because you made money, you can turn yourself into a lady.<eos> But you can't.<eos> You'll never be anything but a common frump whose father lived over a store and whose mother took in washing.<eos> With this money I can get away from every rotten thing that makes me think of this place or you!<eos> Veda!<eos> -Give me that check!<eos> I said give it to me!<eos> -Not on your life!<eos> Get out, Veda.<eos> Get your things out of this house before I throw them into the street.
Come back.<eos> Don't leave us here.<eos> Hollis, snap out of it!<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> He doesn't want anyone.<eos> Better let him get it out of his system.<eos> Let's take 10 minutes.<eos> Do you want to get sick?<eos> Where's your purifying tablet?<eos> I lost them when we made that last river crossing.
Professional singers are invariably persons of dissolute life and habit and, unless they have outstanding merit, rarely make an adequate livelihood.<eos> But, Papa, perhaps I have outstanding merit.<eos> Perhaps, my dear.<eos> Now, I don't want to hear any more about this, Victoria.<eos> In order that the money already invested in your training shall not be wasted I'm arranging for you to give piano lessons to the children of some of my customers.<eos> Yes, Papa.<eos> Tea's ready.<eos> And, oh, Papa, thanks for the darling little guinea pigs.<eos> - Guinea pigs?<eos> - The carrier's just brought them.
Do you love him?<eos> He's quite appealing.<eos> Mind your own business!<eos> Don't worry, I'm not interested.<eos> Aren't you well?<eos> It's all right.<eos> Marina!<eos> You know that's bad for you!<eos> Ridiculous!<eos> Many things are bad for us, and we do them!
Guzzler's Gin, friends.<eos> It comes in five...<eos> Two sizes, two sizes.<eos> Now back to our guest star J. Newton Numbskull.<eos> Thank you, thank you, you drunken tramp, you.<eos> My next poem.<eos> "Put 15 cents on number four"...<eos> My next poem, "The Garters."<eos> I bought my girl some garters At the local five and ten<eos> She gave them to her mother That's the last I'll see of them
I've heard so much about you.<eos> I suppose you've noticed I'm so full of animation... it's impossible for me to sit still.<eos> My grandmother said it's because my glands worked right.<eos> I suppose you'd like to know about my experience.<eos> I've done so much, all kinds of things.<eos> I've been on more bottles...<eos> Cold cures are my specialty.<eos> You know, sneezes and animated stuff, things like that.<eos> I have some photographs here...<eos> I'd rather you wouldn't take them out.
- A sing and a dance<eos> - I'll tak e a chance<eos> - Well, flippity-jippity<eos> - Let's go! - Okay.<eos> Come on, pearl.<eos> - Oh, how I hate oysters.<eos> - Ain't they repulsive?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Every Friday night for the last six months, they order oysters.<eos> Then they don't eat them.
Give it to me!<eos> - Gregory, what is it?<eos> - I'm sorry...<eos> I didn't mean to be so violent.<eos> It's just that...<eos> Why does this letter upset you so?<eos> It's not the letter.<eos> It's just that I am upset for you.<eos> All these things are reminding you of her.<eos> You said that you had lost your fears, and now everything you touch here... brings them back.
No, it isn't here.<eos> You must have dreamed you put it there.<eos> Are you suggesting that this is a knife I hold in my hand?<eos> Have you gone mad, my husband?<eos> Or is it I who am mad? Yes, of course.<eos> That's it.<eos> I am mad.<eos> I'm always losing things and hiding things.<eos> I can never find them.<eos> I don't know where I put them.
You drunk? No.<eos> Give it up, i did.<eos> Give it up.<eos> Ma snowden sent me.<eos> She got herself half a dozen feather pillows, soft enough for aristocracy. Never slept on, neither.<eos> Where'd they come from?<eos> The usual place?<eos> Yes.<eos> You know i don't handle stolen goods, millie.<eos> She'd sell them cheap, she would.
If we get there. Wouldn't surprise me if we didn't.<eos> You wait till I get you on the road.<eos> Ever ride with Dave before, mister?<eos> Nope.<eos> Then try and hold him down. He'll scare the women to death.<eos> I never feel sorry for anything that happens to a woman.<eos> Wonder why a young fella who don't have to... wants to come into this dad-blasted country.<eos> You mean what you said back there about women? Yep.<eos> Then you're smarter than most.<eos> Maybe I've seen more of them than most.
- I don't think so.<eos> All right, you take these, both of you get in there and keep quiet.<eos> As soon as I get rid of him, take her back to the cellar.<eos> All right.<eos> Good evening, may we come in?<eos> Good evening.<eos> No, I never carry them.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> The whereabouts of the two people we are searching for.<eos> - You haven't found them yet?
Germain is trafficking morphine and framing an innocent victim, Marie Corbin, to whom I respectfully bow."<eos> What do you say?<eos> - And Point 3?<eos> Of no importance.<eos> - Point 3: You're a cuckold.<eos> - How would you know?<eos> I got an anonymous letter, too.<eos> All lies, but how unpleasant!<eos> - I don't agree.<eos> - You find them pleasant?
And a long white beard?<eos> Oh, yes, that's him.<eos> Careful, they see us.<eos> - See us?<eos> More like hang us!<eos> Did you see him?<eos> - He measured my head with forceps, with a thermostat, with a phonograph.<eos> With whatever you call this here?<eos> He also gave me these trinkets.<eos> Where did I put them?
Can you tell time? - Why not?<eos> 12 o'clock day... hunger.<eos> 6 o'clock night... drunk.<eos> With luck.<eos> Ten o'clock now.<eos> - You don't need to be a clown.<eos> Do what I tell you and keep out of sight.<eos> Salud, Gypsy. Did you see the air machines?<eos> - See them?<eos> We ate them for breakfast!
- No.<eos> No, I didn't tell you what happened when they herded us up the hill and to the barber shop.<eos> - I don't want to hear it.<eos> Two men looked at me and one said,<eos> "That's the daughter of the mayor."<eos> The other said, "Commence with her." They took me to the barber shop and put me in the chair and held me.<eos> In the mirror I could only see my mother and my father at the moment of the shooting.<eos> My mother's words were in my head like a scream that went on and on.<eos> And I could fell a pain.<eos> They were pulling at my hair and cutting it off with a razor. And then they put the braids in my mouth... and tied them around my neck to make a gag.
The brother of my... ex-employer.<eos> He is a Burschenschafter.<eos> You know what Burschenshafts are?<eos> - No, Miss Hunter.<eos> - Groups of students with political principles.<eos> They assert them by drinking beer and fighting duels.<eos> - Duelling is very popular here, I believe.<eos> - Oh, yes. It's a proud father that has a scarred son, and vice versa.<eos> German girls find scars very attractive.<eos> A book was recently published on the German colonies, in which it was specifically stated that one advantage of possessing duelling scars was that native Africans look with more respect upon white men who bear them.
But I can't imagine who's going to place them end to end, nor why they should consider it the thing to do.<eos> Uncle Phillip never has really been enthusiastic over my career as a model.<eos> Oh, well, relatives are like that.<eos> My, aren't you two mean, going ahead and eating without me.<eos> I'm starving.<eos> Would you pass me one of those plates, please, Mr. Mason?<eos> Oh!<eos> What's the matter, Pat?<eos> Have you just seen his handcuffs?<eos> I heard them as soon as he came in.
I don't know your tastes, I followed those of my master. And here it is.<eos> Risotto à la Rossini, devilled chicken, veal medallions with truffles, cheese, fruit and dessert.<eos> Polenta, always polenta! You eat only polenta here!<eos> Polenta is healthy, young man!<eos> Healthy food, nourishing, wholewheat!<eos> Look in the mirror. In these 3 days you fattened up already.<eos> In 3 days I did nothing but gulp down polenta, chickpeas, chestnuts!<eos> And these hens always in the way!<eos> They have no another place?<eos> Where should I put them?
I've come home, Sam.<eos> Afraid I can't agree with you, Tess.<eos> But, Sam.<eos> This is our apartment by the river you've always wanted, isn't it?<eos> - I'm going to be part of it.<eos> - What's the gag?<eos> Sam, Pop and Ellen were married last night.<eos> I listened to the words.<eos> You can't listen to them without...<eos> You listened to them once before.

Without you I don't know what I would have done.<eos> I had a toothache, and I don't know many people.<eos> I know too many people.<eos> I guess we're both lonely.<eos> Want to know what I was going to do before I ruined my best Sunday clothes?<eos> I bet they're not your best Sunday clothes.<eos> You probably have more. I was just joking.<eos> I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouse in search of my youth.<eos> You see, my mother died a long time ago. Her things were put in storage out West. There wasn't any other place to put them.<eos> I thought I'd send for them now. Tonight I was going to take a look at them.
These pressure-cabin jobs are tricky.<eos> Sure you understand all the controls?<eos> Pressure, oxygen, humidity, temperature?<eos> Certainly. Don't look toward the sun when you get up there.<eos> Its rays will blind you in that thin air.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So long.<eos> Why do we need oxygen masks in a pressure cabin?<eos> - We don't.<eos> - What did we bring them along for?
It's a clubfoot.<eos> She was born that way.<eos> Can't nothing be done?<eos> A doctor said she could be operated... ... butthelastfew yearsI've been so broke, we couldn't.<eos> We hurried with the dishes.<eos> We knew Pa would be talking your ear off.<eos> Isn't the air grand out here?<eos> Look at the stars.<eos> I never knew there were so many in the sky.<eos> Back home you couldn't see them like that.
Don't forget to go see aunt Maura in Naples.<eos> She'd get offended if you...<eos> - I must've written the address.<eos> And the trunk keys? You've got them, right?
Tom, aren't you cute.<eos> - May I lend you my car?<eos> - Thank you, I hired one.<eos> We're catching a plane for Paris at 14:55.<eos> Paris. Pleasant feeling to be in Paris instead of a pine box.<eos> I hope heaven can wait, Father.<eos> Your chances of heaven seem remote to me, my son.<eos> - You have everything, Mr. Martin?<eos> - Yes, I think so.<eos> I'll leave the playing cards. Have them cleaned before you play with the Father. - He has them all marked.
And until then, I know I can match Mrs Howard against the best overseer in the country.<eos> You'll do my work for me, won't you?<eos> You held me tighter in your arms on a certain night at Elm Hill.<eos> - That's not true, madam.<eos> - Promise me one thing.<eos> What, darling? When you're ranting and raving your worst, that you'll stop at least once every day and think of me, the children and Albemarle.<eos> Jane, lass, you know I will.<eos> You've a long ride, Matt.<eos> I offer, as a resolution, that this Virginia body set up a Committee of Correspondence authorised to communicate in writing with all other colonies.<eos> Further, we urge them to establish similar committees, so we may exchange common grievances and keep each other informed.
But, Mama, why?<eos> Your father must call on Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy this very afternoon.<eos> If he doesn't, the Lucases will.<eos> That's what it looks like.<eos> But the damask, milady.<eos> Oh, we'll choose the material some other time, Mr. Beck.<eos> Come, Charlotte.<eos> Hurry, my dear!<eos> Where are those girls?<eos> Whenever I want them, I never can find them.
Probably the head gardener wishing instructions.<eos> Did you want to see me, Mrs. Danvers?<eos> Mr. De Winter informed me that his sister, Mrs. Lacy, and Major Lacy are expected for luncheon.<eos> I'd like to know if you approve of the menu.<eos> Oh, well, I'm sure it's very suitable, very nice indeed.<eos> You will notice, madam, that I've left a blank space for the sauce.<eos> Mrs. De Winter was most particular about sauces.<eos> Let's have whatever you think that Mrs. De Winter would have ordered.<eos> Thank you, madam.<eos> When you've finished your letters, Robert will take them to the post.
I'm sorry, Miss Latham, but I can't take time to explain.<eos> Either you open the door or we break it in.<eos> Break that door in, and the Queen shall hear of it!<eos> The Queen will hear of it if we don't.<eos> Very well.<eos> Break it in.<eos> Guards!<eos> Stop him!<eos> Have you nine lives, Capt. Thorpe?<eos> Surely by now most of them must be used up.
- Oh, that's easy.<eos> The bashful one's the girl.<eos> And now for the topper.<eos> You know how you drive up, and you've got to get out and open the doors?<eos> That ain't for me.<eos> Get a load of this.<eos> - Say, I'm speechless.<eos> - That's where we came in.<eos> Now you see, all you've got to do is drive or walk between the posts break the ray, and the doors start swinging.<eos> Want to see me close them?
How do you do? How do you do?<eos> And Dr. Petry.<eos> How do, Mrs. Martin.<eos> Oh, I'll pass the lot of them.<eos> - Fall in.<eos> Outside. - All right, men.<eos> Don't be afraid of these women.<eos> They're good neighbours, once they get over being mad at you for being pretty.<eos> Don't be so silly.<eos> That bonnet you've got on is giving them a lot of worry.
You brought a lot of pretty things with you, Mrs. Martin. Heavenly.<eos> I told Mother there was no sense bringing a lot of clothes.<eos> I'd rather spend the money on furniture.<eos> I see you've got one of these feathers.<eos> Yes. Mother had five of them at home.<eos> She said there are times when that could be more important than bread.<eos> What is it?<eos> A pheasant's feather.<eos> It looks like an angel's wing.<eos> We had a lot of them. They collected so much dust we threw them out. Yeah.
Of course, of course. I'd forgotten.<eos> The Czernys, they're all like that. You know, I met an old aunt. The Countess Antonia.<eos> I thought she was an Indian. Turned out she used paprika instead of face powder.<eos> But your husband seems quite normal.<eos> Oh, he is, for long stretches, and then comes one of his attacks. This morning was typical.<eos> Waking up and imagining we had a daughter.<eos> And a daughter with measles, too.<eos> One mustn't contradict him, of course.<eos> Does he get violent if you do?<eos> Oh, yes. He breaks things and eats them sometimes.
- What's your name?<eos> - Richard Jones.<eos> - Dick, thanks ever so much.<eos> Good luck, Senator.<eos> - See you in the White House, Joe.<eos> - No kidding.<eos> Sorry, I was in committee.<eos> I see you had a little publicity...<eos> Have you got your credentials?<eos> - Saunders gave them to me.
50,000 telegrams demanding that he yield this floor.<eos> I invite the Senate to read them.<eos> I invite my colleague to read them.<eos> The people's answer to Mr Jefferson Smith.<eos> Stop, Jeff, stop!<eos> I guess this is just another lost cause, Mr Paine.<eos> All you people don't know about lost causes.<eos> Mr Paine does.<eos> He said once they were the only causes worth fighting for.<eos> And he fought for them for the only reason any man ever fights for them.
- I don't know, I never tried it.<eos> - Didn't you ask her to?<eos> - Who?<eos> - That girl.<eos> I told you, I wouldn't ask any woman.<eos> What if she were willing?<eos> Yeah, that's what they all say.<eos> Women think they can take it, but they can't.<eos> The minute you're in the air they call the airport.<eos> When you get down, you find them waiting, so scared they hate you.
-And he answered?<eos> -Nothing.<eos> Well, that, frankly, madam, as Essex's friend, that can hardly be tolerated.<eos> -Nor will it be.<eos> -But I don't wish to turn you against him.<eos> Perhaps there was some misunderstanding.<eos> Misunderstanding?<eos> He had my letters, didn't he?<eos> Didn't he?<eos> If you sent them, he should have received them.
Who killed the Witch of the East?<eos> Was it you?<eos> No. No, it was an accident.<eos> I didn't mean to kill anybody.<eos> Well, my little pretty, I can cause accidents too!<eos> -Aren't you forgetting the ruby slippers? -The slippers.<eos> Yes!<eos> The slippers!<eos> They're gone!<eos> The ruby slippers! What have you done with them?
Give them back to me or I'll<eos> It's too late!<eos> There they are, and there they'll stay!<eos> Give me back my slippers!<eos> Only I know how to use them.<eos> They're of no use to you.<eos> Give them back to me.<eos> Give them back!<eos> Keep tight inside of them.<eos> Their magic must be powerful or she wouldn't want them so badly.
To the arms of our pet cowboy, darling.<eos> - Miriam Aarons!<eos> - Why he's plum loco for you, Countess.<eos> He likes you even better than his horse, and it's a blasted big horse.<eos> Buck Winston is nice.<eos> He's so young and strong.<eos> Have you noticed the play of his muscles?<eos> Musical!<eos> You don't mean to say his joints squeak?<eos> He could crack a coconut with those knees if he could get them together.
Keep your eye on the professor tonight and on Rocks, understand?<eos> Sure.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Tug?<eos> You know when and where to drive up with the truck?<eos> I sure do, professor.<eos> Very well.<eos> I'll repeat our plan of attack.<eos> One, select the furs from the warehouse.<eos> Two, we transport them over the roof to the adjacent box factory.

-Some people were waiting for me.<eos> -Oh.<eos> Well, I got a kick coming, though.<eos> -You have?<eos> What?<eos> -Why haven't you written to me?<eos> -You know how it is, Jerry.<eos> I changed my address and number so often, you had no way to answer me.<eos> You know what happens to letters written in the stir.<eos> Everybody reads them.
(GIGGLING) Oh, no, Michael.<eos> No, no, Michael.<eos> No. You promised me, Michael.<eos> No.<eos> Now, you promised. No, no, no, Michael. No.<eos> Let me go. Michael. You don't want me to, you're just pretending.<eos> Between you and me there's a whole world of seven wives.<eos> Stop being jealous. I tell you I've forgotten they exist.<eos> Oh, that's just it.<eos> You buy wives just like shirts, and after you've worn them, you toss them away.
Linda you agree there's only one thing for me to do now, don't you?<eos> Compromise?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> You think that's right, don't you?<eos> - I don't think it matters a bit what I think.<eos> - It does though, Linda.<eos> You think it's right, don't you?<eos> Say you think it's right.<eos> Johnny, when two people love each other as much as you do anything that keeps them apart must be wrong.
Are you kidding?<eos> He's greedy and fussy.<eos> You're right.<eos> He wants to eat duck in orange sauce.<eos> Duck in orange sauce!<eos> It'll be a disaster.<eos> - Well, Eva, how are the mimosas?<eos> - They're fine.<eos> Look how they're swaying.<eos> I watered them yesterday with a mixture of gin and whiskey.
All right, put out that light and bring some up<eos> Thank you<eos> - Quiet!<eos> Put out the light!<eos> Noodle-man!<eos> No light?<eos> I've sold out, I'm sorry<eos> Sold out?<eos> Who are those bowls for?<eos> Who ordered them?
- I won't turn my back on you!<eos> - Butch is great, he's promised us some chicken mixed with lamb.<eos> - I didn't promise. - Now, Butch!<eos> You promised!<eos> I'll do something for you one day.<eos> Butch, you got a friend?<eos> He says no!<eos> The..er..."The calla lilies are in bloom again.<eos> "A flower suitable for every occasion...<eos> "I carried them on my wedding day, and now place them here." Cue. "Are you gathered to mourn?
We're coming.<eos> Pick an exit. It won't be long now.<eos> "Here she is now." "What shall we say to her?" "I don't know."<eos> "She's probably broken-hearted.<eos> I'll talk to her."<eos> - FAINTLY:<eos> - "Hello mother, hello dad.<eos> "The calla lilies are in bloom again.<eos> "Such a strange flower. "Suitable to any occasion.<eos> "I carried them for my wedding, and place them here in memory of something that has died."
- I heard them.<eos> I know.<eos> - Now, darling.<eos> - But I didn't kill him.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I'm sure I didn't.<eos> - You'll help me, won't you, Nora?<eos> - Why, of course, darling.<eos> But you'd better lie down now and get some rest.<eos> They gave me some pills, but I didn't take them.
For both of us.<eos> And that goes for you, too.<eos> Go on.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Did you say something about scrambled eggs?<eos> No, darling, you must have been dreaming.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> No, why?<eos> You want some scrambled eggs, dear?<eos> - I can fix them for you if you want them.
- I think so.<eos> Now you'll see that mom tells to dad the whole bit on Solaro.<eos> Lectures annoy me.<eos> You deal with that. Bye!<eos> Hello Emanuele.<eos> - Oh, dear, you had a nice walk?<eos> Yes, I brought Osterreich to the Valentino.<eos> But I got angry with the girls.<eos> - Why? Imagine, they got off the coach and strolled with an officer.<eos> Did you scold them?
- Arthur?<eos> Who's Arthur?<eos> He's the shipping clerk at the tallow works.<eos> Wants a $2 raise, or he'll quit.<eos> What do I care?<eos> Did you see this stuff in the paper?<eos> How did it get in there?<eos> What did you do last night?<eos> What did you do to those bodyguards?<eos> Said you locked them up.
I mean, when you were younger.<eos> It's likely to happen to anybody.<eos> Just the other morning, I read about Mr Cedar's own son, how he got drunk and insisted on driving a taxicab while the driver sat inside.<eos> Isn't that so?<eos> Isn't that so?<eos> - Your Honour, I object.<eos> - Proceed.<eos> Now, about the Faulkner sisters.<eos> That's funny, Mr Cedar going to Mandrake Falls to bring them here.<eos> - Do you mind if I talk to them?
I thought it was just the words.<eos> I like it because the words are all the same.<eos> That's probably why "The Star Spangled Banner" is so confusing.<eos> Nobody seems to know the words.<eos> Except, perhaps, Godfrey.<eos> He seems to know everything.<eos> - Do you know the words?<eos> - The words?<eos> Yes, yes."The Star Spangled Banner." Nobody seems to know the words.<eos> Do you know them, Godfrey?
Somebody lost?<eos> There seems to be a pearl necklace missing.<eos> - Do you know anything about it?<eos> - Well, let's look for it.<eos> - That's too bad.<eos> - It's too bad for you.<eos> I wouldn't be so cocksure of everything.<eos> This is a serious matter.<eos> The pearls couldn't just get up and walk away.<eos> She probably threw them out of the taxi.
- Coming, Anatole? - And that's that.<eos> - I'm caught on the hook!<eos> - Look at that idiot.<eos> You'll put my eye out with that fishing rod!<eos> - Let's enjoy your freedom.<eos> - Hurry, it's getting late.<eos> Mother, Father agreed!<eos> You must be more careful with ladies.<eos> They're delicate.<eos> That's why we love them.
Ladies and gentlemen... with your kind attention and permission... I have the honor of presenting to you... one of the most remarkable men in the world.<eos> - How remarkable? - He's sweating.<eos> Can you be surprised at that, gentlemen?<eos> Every day he commits to memory 50 new facts... and remembers every one of them.
You heard those men say he got in there.<eos> Shall we take him now or wait till the interval?<eos> What you going to do? There's nothing missing. There's an end to it.<eos> Hear that tune?<eos> That's that damn thing I couldn't get out of my head.<eos> Now I know where I heard it before.<eos> Of course, that music hall.<eos> Annabella's...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen... with your kind attention and permission... I have now the honor to present to you... one of the most remarkable men in the world. - That's the same man.<eos> - Every day he commits to memory... 50 new facts, and remembers every one of them.
Your Excellency, if my poor husband were alive... he has been in the enjoyment of God for the past 15 years... he'd have beaten her black and blue.<eos> But don't be deceived by her language. My daughter is a good girl.<eos> We could be rich, my daughter and I.<eos> We could have mules and necklaces, and live in the country... but wickedness has never spent a night here.<eos> How I worry when I see my daughter leave in the morning.<eos> How can you say that, Mother, when you sleep all day?<eos> There!<eos> You see what bad examples these factory girls are!<eos> All ugly words she must hear!<eos> If my daughter had listened to them, she would have gone wrong long ago.
- She said you were her friend.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - In the ward with Dr. Wong.<eos> - Has he come yet? - Yes.<eos> He's with your husband.<eos> Oh, thank heaven.<eos> Prepare for amputation.<eos> Doctor.<eos> His hands?<eos> Can you save them?
But nobody knows that.<eos> Excepting you and me.<eos> It's our little secret.<eos> And now I shall play to you, for the last time.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> These are Rollo's fingers, Rollo's hands.<eos> It was Rollo who told me that I killed him.<eos> My friend, Rollo's head was cut off months ago.<eos> Yes, but Gogol put it back for him.<eos> He took off his hands and put them onto my arms.
- Sophie, I've tried to forget you.<eos> And have you, John?<eos> I thought I had, but now I know I haven't.<eos> Gee, you're swell.<eos> John, you have a line that just sweeps a girl right off her feet.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> When are you going to show me Paris?<eos> You'd be bored seeing Paris with a small-town hick like me, who only knows how to order meat and potatoes and pie.<eos> Oh, please forget I ever said those things.<eos> I only said them because you were going away.
Come on. Breakfast will be ready soon.<eos> You sweet thing.<eos> Where'd you get it pressed?<eos> I'll count to 10. If you're not out of bed by then I'll drag you out myself.<eos> - One, two, three, four, five...<eos> - I really think you would!<eos> I'm out! I'm out!<eos> You'll find the showers just behind the second cottage.<eos> Outside?<eos> All the best homes have them outside.
You did the right thing about the Butterfields.<eos> And, George... after I've gone, don't change.<eos> Don't ever bow to double chins. Stay an artist.<eos> That's important.<eos> In fact, the most important thing.<eos> I didn't want to praise you in front of Gilda, but you certainly pack a wicked right.<eos> A real wallop.<eos> There are a number of things here which belong to her. Oh, that's all right.<eos> Never mind.<eos> No, no, I don't want them.
If it were up to me, you would have broken with the baroness long ago.<eos> It's no laugh anymore, the way you're looking now.<eos> There are enough nice girls around.<eos> Come on, come with me.<eos> You don't want to spoil all the fun.<eos> At least, you can accompany us home and give me the keys.<eos> The keys?<eos> - I don't have the keys any more.<eos> I see...<eos> The baroness took them?
Pleased to meet you.<eos> Take a look at this, Gus, and learn something.<eos> I am delighted.<eos> I have heard so much about you.<eos> Yeah, but you can't prove it.<eos> Serge is my new assistant, Lou.<eos> Day or night work, Rita?<eos> He should be a big help.<eos> - You got the pictures, Lou?<eos> - Yeah, I had them taken with all my rocks.
After this, no more ballets for me.<eos> Jazz.<eos> Just jazz.<eos> If the house is empty again....<eos> I don't know.<eos> When she gets her paint on, hears the music, she'll be fine.<eos> I know these people.<eos> Here she is.<eos> Why did you bring the pearls?<eos> I said I won't wear them.
I wish I could get as big a kick out of it as you got out of this luncheon.<eos> It must be a grand feeling to have everything you want.<eos> If it is, I never had it.<eos> Oh, I suppose I should be the happiest woman in the world.<eos> Beautiful home, successful husband and a nice youngster, but...<eos> Add it all up and it spells herring!<eos> Is that it?<eos> Somehow the things that make other people happy leave me cold.<eos> I guess something must have been left out of my makeup.<eos> I think I want things passionately, and when I get them, I lose all interest.
- Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, may I?<eos> - Now, mademoiselle.<eos> - Yes, madame?<eos> You see, uh...<eos> Not a word to Monsieur La Valle.<eos> About what?<eos> Potatoes.<eos> He doesn't want me to eat them, and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Miss Weston.<eos> Mr. Harker.<eos> Count Dracula has just rented Carfax Abbey.<eos> It will be a joy to see those dark windows lit up again.<eos> Count, I beg you to excuse me. There's a phone call for me.<eos> In the meantime, please be seated.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> A very nice house could be built out of those Carfax ruins.<eos> Of course, it would take a lot of money.<eos> I shall barely touch them.
Renfield, you know where those boxes are.<eos> Tell us and we shall protect you.<eos> But I no longer need your protection.<eos> The Master is not angry with me.<eos> On the contrary, he's pleased.<eos> He came to my window in the moonlight and promised me things.<eos> Not to say them, but to do them.<eos> - Do them?<eos> - Yes!<eos> To make them happen.
You can take the children back to school.<eos> I sold the sheep's meat to someone.<eos> But the sheep belong to the people.<eos> Go and tell your people!<eos> What will they live on if you kill all the sheep?<eos> Who are you exactly?<eos> You and that rabble?<eos> Are you stirring them up against me?<eos> He wants to slaughter your sheep!<eos> I've paid for them, so I can sell them too.

- "Bobo is so lonely." - Just a moment.<eos> I don't see how that trash can possibly concern me.<eos> But you don't know who Bobo is. And who Babykins is.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> Smythe will open the door.<eos> Smythe will open...<eos> But Bobo is your brother Michael.<eos> And, of course, nobody would ever guess who Babykins is.<eos> Where did you get those letters?<eos> I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.

In Alabama, the tusks are looser. But that's entirely ir-elephant.<eos> We took pictures of the native girls, but they weren't developed.<eos> But we're going back in a couple of weeks...<eos> Very enlightening.<eos> - Hooray for Captain Spaulding.<eos> Three cheers!<eos> Three cheers for Captain Spaulding!<eos> Three cheers...<eos> - No one asked for the chairs.<eos> Put them back. Now get along.
All hot.<eos> How long have you been here?<eos> Three years.<eos> -What for?<eos> -Robbery.<eos> I can't stand thieves.<eos> -Hey, my cigarettes. -What?<eos> You took my cigarettes.<eos> Why, you dirty little liar, you didn't have no cigarettes.<eos> Yes, I did, and you stole them.
With your permission... I'll pull a few eggs from under your nose.<eos> As you can see... I have nothing... In my hand!<eos> Here, take it, please!<eos> There's something to be proud of.<eos> Watch this, Herr Professor.<eos> Honey, hand me my small case.<eos> You are a clumsy one.<eos> Why did you bring the postcards?<eos> What a dumb question.<eos> We sell them every night!
"...or do you believe you can pay me off?"<eos> "- perhaps because I didn't take you to where you belong!"<eos> "So was that not meant -"<eos> "I was until yesterday evening a dutiful constable -<eos> ...and now -"<eos> "You must stay with me - forever - as my wife -"<eos> "Do you even realise what you've said?<eos> - policeman and thief -"<eos> "Thief?<eos> Desperate people may do wrong but that doesn't make them bad!"
To be continued<eos> THE WITCH Chapter 4.<eos> Two "honest" matrons will change the accused in jail, so that she will not wear hidden witch powder.<eos> "Maria the Weaver was just taken here accused of witchcraft."<eos> "Master, look carefully, there might be witch powder hidden in the sorceress' hair."<eos> The suspect's nights are now dictated by the inquisition judges.<eos> Two honorable men try amiably to persuade her to confess.<eos> If she stubbornly denies her charges, they will use a kind of mental torture.<eos> "Woman, see here the seven holy words of Jesus crucified, written on consecrated parchment."<eos> "I will hang them around her neck, so that the Devil will no longer help her to be silent."
Oh, please, will you...<eos> Please, isn't there anybody who can help me with a little milk?<eos> My baby is starving.<eos> Be quiet!<eos> Let it die!<eos> It's better off!<eos> Kill it!<eos> Kill it!<eos> You're mad to say that!<eos> All right, then. I will kill it for you!
I'll grow up big and strong... and you'll be proud of me, you'll see.<eos> Come right home after school, OK, big brother?<eos> Don't forget, OK?<eos> 'Cause we're going down the river, right?<eos> You promise?<eos> What's that you're making, Gen, a boat?<eos> Yeah.<eos> OK, Shinji, here's your boat.<eos> You ready?<eos> We're finally going to put it in the river like we said.
And back here.<eos> I was lucky with parts. I replaced an entire door on the side.<eos> Can you see where the paint does not quite match?<eos> No. lt is one hell of a job.<eos> - One hell of a job, Arnie.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> I really like this shade of red, Arnie.<eos> I did not think, they made it anymore.
Did we ever reach Mrs...<eos> What was her name?<eos> - Her friend in Werdon?<eos> - Where's your wife's car, Mr Trenton? - The what?<eos> It bothers me. Kemp came here, right?<eos> He grabs your wife and son. Why? Well, he's crazy, which is reason enough.<eos> Where's her car?<eos> It's in the shop at Camber's. The needle valve is sticking.<eos> - Joe Camber's?<eos> - Yes, Joe Camber's. - She was going to take it in. - When would that have been?
I should think about 150 men altogether, sir.<eos> Jolly good.<eos> I haven't got the final figures, but there's a lot of seriously wounded in the compound...<eos> Yes, well, the thing is, Sergeant, I've got a bit of a problem here.<eos> One of the officers has lost a leg.<eos> Oh, no, sir!<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> Probably a tiger.<eos> In Africa?<eos> The MO says we can stitch it back on if we can find it immediately.
Check this one.<eos> This is one of the bad ones, but-- I got us some good ones and shit, man. It's there.<eos> So you carry 'em for me? What you mean?<eos> No, they not looking for me.<eos> You know who they looking for, man?<eos> They're looking for my brother Bobby.<eos> No, 'cause the bitch up the street talkin' about I broke in her house.<eos> She said I broke in there and stole some of her shit.<eos> I didn't do it 'cause I told her, you know.<eos> I said, "Look, I want your shit, I just come in here and take it."
Tony!<eos> Thanks.<eos> Tony.<eos> God, what's happened?<eos> Where's Frank?<eos> Where do you think?<eos> Come on. Get your stuff.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> So you come to me with some kind of thing. Okay.<eos> You propose it, I talk to you.
- I got you.<eos> Now, wait a minute, ma'am.<eos> What the hell are you doing in there... all dressed up with a cowboy hat on?<eos> I'm getting all hot and bothered for the evening, darling.<eos> - Come along with me.<eos> - You got it!<eos> - Give me the key, Junior.<eos> - I left it in the car.<eos> - You left the key in the car?<eos> - If I keep it with me, I might lose it.
Not so fast.<eos> I'm not a lawyer.<eos> I'd have to check with one.<eos> I know we'd have to have documentation.<eos> I'd like to kill the son of a bitch.<eos> I can't help you with that. Dorothy:<eos> He called me 5 times last night.<eos> I didn't get any sleep.<eos> That's why I kept missing my mark.<eos> We'll get it after lunch.
And to you Wes is a god?<eos> No. Just an ordinary man.<eos> Ahead of his time, but just a man.<eos> - Wes is an asshole.<eos> - Blasphemy!<eos> You'll smoke a turd in hell for that!<eos> Wes says your gun is your friend.<eos> - Yes, I love my gun.<eos> - Well, here is your gun.<eos> Show me how you'll use it when Jack gets here.
Debbie... Wylder.<eos> You wanna come up, please? .<eos> Will you kinda settle down a little, please?<eos> . - Hi, Debbie.<eos> - Howya feeling?<eos> - Debbie, you had quite a scare yesterday, didn'tyou? .<eos> It was, um, terrifying.<eos> Let the laughter go. That's just a nervous reaction.<eos> - Keep letting it go.<eos> Try to feel the real feelings behind it. - Letyour arms relax.
I said "take it out".<eos> Dear Vaso, I repeat:<eos> I'll do what the comrades in charge will order me to do.<eos> - Where have you been, Soso?<eos> - l've been working.<eos> - Have you brought it?<eos> - Do yourjob!<eos> I'll go to Otar immediately.<eos> Yes, please, go to him and give him your request.<eos> I will write it right away.
Don't we know it?<eos> You don't know it?<eos> Everybody knows it, so what?<eos> And what's the reason for it?<eos> One is not supposed to ask.<eos> Nothing happens without a reason.<eos> I've left the first copy for you.<eos> - Get it registered at the bureau.<eos> - Tina has it locked.<eos> Can I count on your reading it soon?
I thank you for showing me such goodness!<eos> He who tomorrow is to be called my husband, I shall appeal to his loving nature that he may show mercy to Friedrich, too.<eos> You bind me in fetters of gratitude!<eos> At dawn let me see you ready.<eos> Adorned in splendid garments you shall accompany me to the minster.<eos> There I shall await my knight to become his wife before God!<eos> His wife!<eos> How can I ever repay such kindness for l am powerless and wretched?<eos> If you allowed me to live with you I would always be the beggar!<eos> I am left but one power, no law robbed me of it; through it I could perhaps protect you, save you from the scourge of remorse!
Tell me without remorse whence you came - may the power of silence be proved through me!<eos> You have already to thank me for the highest confidence since I gladly believed the oath you made.<eos> If you never falter before my command I shall consider you to be above all other women!<eos> Come to me, O sweet, pure one!<eos> Be near my ardent heart, that the eyes in which I saw all my happiness may shine upon me softly!<eos> Oh, grant me that in sweet raptures I may breathe in your breath!<eos> Oh, let me clasp you to me firmly, that I may be happy in you!<eos> Your love must be the highest recompense for that which I left behind for your sake;<eos> no destiny in all God's world could have been nobler than mine.<eos> If the King offered me his crown I should rightfully reject it.
I don't care. It might lead us out of this time warp.<eos> At least it looks like civilisation.<eos> Scobie, stay where you are and that is an order.<eos> -Remember the Indian rope trick.<eos> -I can't see anything.<eos> What was the Indian rope trick?<eos> Someone's ship?<eos> Been here a long time.<eos> Doctor, can we get out of here?<eos> So this fakir throws the rope up in the air and he and his assistant climb up it, hey presto, disappeared.
I pray to the Four Winds.<eos> And you?<eos> To Crom.<eos> But I seldom pray to him.<eos> He doesn't listen.<eos> What good is he then?<eos> It's just as I've always said.<eos> He's strong.<eos> If I die, I have to go before him and he will ask, what's the rule of steel?<eos> If I don't know it, he will cast me away.
Run it through the computer.<eos> - I already have!<eos> - Good.<eos> Just to be safe should I check the rear data banks? - No.<eos> You check the rear data banks.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Sir, you should put that case in the compartment above your head.<eos> - I'll keep it with me.<eos> - I'll help if you can't get it up.<eos> I said I'll keep it with me.
Ted climbs in with the German and he speaks like a teacher.<eos> - That can't work.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Ted speaks German to the German.<eos> It won't work.<eos> No.<eos> But if Ted gets in the sack instead of Edith...<eos> It vitiates the whole reason...<eos> You didn't hear the last part.<eos> I'll bounce it off you.
Ted speaks German to the German.<eos> It won't work.<eos> No.<eos> But if Ted gets in the sack instead of Edith...<eos> It vitiates the whole reason...<eos> You didn't hear the last part.<eos> I'll bounce it off you.<eos> - Let him bounce.<eos> - I can't concentrate.<eos> Let me bounce it off you.
I'd take him to the doctor.<eos> You're watching television.<eos> Suddenly you realize there's a wasp crawling on your arm.<eos> I'd kill it.<eos> You're reading a magazine.<eos> You come across a full-page nude photo of a girl.<eos> Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?<eos> Just answer the questions, please.<eos> You show it to your husband.<eos> He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
You wanted to know the story of Fitzcarraldo. It's a strange story- a little bit Sisyphus-like story or... a story of, uh, challenge of the impossible.<eos> The title itself- I will start with that - uh, is derived from an Irish name - Fitzgerald. The leading character's name is Bryan Sweeney Fitzgerald.<eos> And since nobody can pronounce his name in the Amazon here... he calls himself Fitzcarraldo, and he also founds a town with the name Fitzcarraldo.<eos> There was a historical figure whose name was Carlos Fermín Fitzcarrald... a caucho baron.<eos> I must say the story of this caucho baron did not interest me so much.<eos> What interested me more was one single detail. That was, uh, that he crossed an isthmus... from one river system into another... uh, with a boat.<eos> They disassembled the boat and - and put it together again on the other river.
You know, the... nun who taught the lepers how to sing.<eos> - How wonderful of you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> John Hay Forrest said you were a friend of Carlotta's.<eos> Will you excuse me?<eos> I must have hit a nerve.<eos> She went white as a ghost.<eos> The next day I tailed Kitty Collins to a fancy restaurant.<eos> Midway through the meal, she noticed me and did a pretty strange thing.<eos> She took off her brooch and ditched it.
Philip.<eos> I see the company is assembled.<eos> And what are we to be spectators of?<eos> You must not be surprised. We are here at your request.<eos> I did not request an audience nor a dinner on the grass.<eos> Perhaps we are to applaud the view.<eos> The scribbler is never satisfied.<eos> He is as insatiable as a... You've said that Mr. Talmann should be here dressed as you asked and carrying a gold-topped cane.<eos> We have taken you at your word.<eos> There was another instruction, but conveniently I have forgotten it.
See?<eos> And this is Boba Fett.<eos> Look.<eos> They can even have wars.<eos> And look.<eos> Fish.<eos> The fish eat the fish food and the shark eats the fish but nobody eats a shark.<eos> See, this is Pez. Candy.<eos> You see, you eat it.<eos> You put the candy in here and when you lift the head, the candy comes out and you can eat it.
His blind skill is remarkable, and soon he's back onto the road... in the burning, shadowless light.<eos> One night by the campfire he's seated near an old man who's telling some children about the forests and springs.<eos> The youth recalls what he's been through, but faintly and indistinctly... as in a dream.<eos> He turns to the old man, skeptical yet courteous, and asks,<eos> "Where does all this water come from?"<eos> "It comes from a mountain whose peak is covered by a mighty cloud."<eos> "What kind of cloud?" the youth asks.<eos> The old man answers,<eos> "Every man carries within him hopes, fears and longings.<eos> Every man shouts out his despair or bears it in his mind.
You can't what?<eos> It was you who told me to forget about it. because she didn't mean one dried fig to you.<eos> Her yes, not him!<eos> Holy Christ, You cannot spend your life waiting for the moment of revenge.<eos> - You can't understand.<eos> - Who knows what I can't understand!<eos> I am a person just like you, right?<eos> Only of a different sex.<eos> Tell me the truth, why do you want to know it?<eos> I am in the very same situation... as when I'm looking for the solution to the plot of a film, but can't find it.
Oh, well it wasn't great.<eos> I'm just an amateur speculator on science, I admit it.<eos> Oh, I liked your book, Professor.<eos> Both of 'em. I liked both of 'em.<eos> The first one was chosen as the best philosophical treatise of the year by a committee of publishers.<eos> - Oh, which one was that?<eos> - Conceptual Pragmatism.<eos> Oh, I haven't gotten to that yet.<eos> Exactly what is it?<eos> The house is exactly as I remember it.
How did you get loose?<eos> And what's that on your head?<eos> It's smells of the stuff the white coats put over everything.<eos> The white-coats made me better.<eos> First they made me ill, and then they made me better.<eos> I've been ill, you know.<eos> Look, flat face.<eos> How does the tobacco-man go through that door?<eos> He is usually carrying things.<eos> And he pushes it with his shoulder or his foot, and then edges through sideways.
Shhh. It matters not.<eos> I've just come from speaking with Machelli.<eos> The rebellion begins tomorrow.<eos> Spread the word.<eos> Quickly now.<eos> I can hardly believe it.<eos> Tomorrow I shall be king.<eos> - The crown will be yours.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But I'll not wear it, Alana.
And I got the only key.<eos> - Would that test have worked, Doc?<eos> - I think so, yes.<eos> Somebody else sure as hell thought so.<eos> Well, who else could've used that key?<eos> Nobody!<eos> I just give it to Copper whenever he needs it.<eos> Could anybody have gotten it from you, Doc?<eos> I don't see how.<eos> As soon as I'm finished, I return it right away.
Diesel oil.<eos> Can you lift it?<eos> I'm not strong enough.<eos> You'll have to eat more then, won't you?<eos> You'll need these papers for the boat.<eos> And you'll need this US money.<eos> Keep it safe.<eos> The boat you're on is very reliable.<eos> They asked you to bring one can of diesel.<eos> I'll take it for you.
Let's do that some more. I think the guard saw me.<eos> Come on!<eos> - Halt.<eos> - Dumont.<eos> I can't stand this commotion.<eos> What do you want? I've come to communicate with my User.<eos> Difficult proposition. Difficult proposition at best.<eos> Why, could be de-rezzed just for letting you in here.<eos> They hate this tower.<eos> They'd close it down if they dared.
But... he's fired from the firm... his wife divorces him... he starts hitting' the booze... and he mopes around for about three and a half years.<eos> You like that story, Laura?<eos> What else do you wanna know about Frankie?<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Thanks for calling.<eos> Frank Galvin.<eos> Uh... I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye.<eos> Well, uh, I'd like to discuss your firm's offer of that 210...<eos> Uh, well, in the sense that, uh... well, we'd like to accept it.
Now let's not waste these people's time.<eos> Answer the question, Mr Witness, please.<eos> Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?<eos> In that small context, I would have to say no.<eos> Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?<eos> - Given the limits of your question, yes.<eos> - The doctors were not negligent.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm not through questioning...<eos> Your Honour, with all due respect... if you're gonna try my case for me, I wish you wouldn't lose it.
delicious wine.<eos> Maybe you'd Iike to choose your two desserts.<eos> apple flan and Coupe Jacques might go well together.<eos> Just a small coffee.<eos> Good evening.<eos> I had the pleasure of hearing you sing this afternoon.<eos> You must be mistaken.<eos> I haven't sung in about two weeks.<eos> Your audition at Chez Lui.<eos> That wasn't singing, and I would hardly call it an audition.
I was born in Clifton, New Jersey...<eos> Is there anyone here from Clifton?<eos> - Mr. Pipkin.<eos> - Pupkin.<eos> - Pupkin.<eos> Sorry. - You'll get it right one of these days.<eos> - I'll bet you have a tape for me.<eos> - Right here.<eos> Got your name on it?<eos> We'll listen to it and get it back to you as soon as we can.
Jimmy you don't understand anything.<eos> What I don't understand anything is why anybody would want to take your picture.<eos> That's what I don't understand.<eos> You're just a freak.<eos> A weirdo.<eos> Behind your back everybody laughs.<eos> They call you chicken woman.<eos> That's why you look just like her.<eos> Such a sweet point.<eos> Don't step on that shoe, we'll have to pay for it. C'mon!
I'll keep an eye on the door.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Do you know if the receptionist is coming back soon?<eos> Yeah, I guess so.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Please, I'll be with you in a few moments.<eos> I have to talk to you right now, doctor.<eos> Will you please get out of here?<eos> It's about this drug, Dr. Frane.<eos> I understand you've been prescribing it to some patients.
- I got them on the manifest.<eos> Either he did it, or he knows who did it, or he can find out who did it.<eos> - See if Meersma got anything from IRS.<eos> You think we should let this cool down? No. I'm sorry about Perrone, I got a job to do.<eos> This thing isn't just gonna go away.<eos> I still gotta find who hit Diaz.<eos> That's what they're paying me for.<eos> "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.<eos> I solemnly assure you, unless the grain of wheat falls to the earth and dies, it remains just a grain of wheat, but if it dies, it produces much fruit.<eos> The man who loves his life loses it, while the man who hates his life in this world preserves it through life eternal."
The man's a friend of mine!<eos> -Well, he ain't no friend to me.<eos> -Gentlemen, please.<eos> -A gun!<eos> -I know where you can get a gun.<eos> -Don't I need a silver bullet? -Oh, be serious, would you?<eos> -Madness.<eos> -No, a gun would be good.<eos> Put the gun to your head and pull the trigger.<eos> If you put it in your mouth you'd be sure not to miss.
Very lucky.<eos> Mild shock, some cuts and bruises.<eos> No major injuries.<eos> - Can I see her? - She might be asleep.<eos> She's sedated.<eos> - I'll just say goodbye.<eos> - Don't stay too long.<eos> How you doin'?<eos> - Do you have my purse? - No.<eos> I'm sure the police'll find it.
"Matty"?<eos> I like it.<eos> It's right over your heart.<eos> - At least it's cool.<eos> I was burning up.<eos> - I asked you not to talk about the heat.<eos> Would you get me a paper towel? Dip it in some cold water.<eos> Right away.<eos> I'll even wipe it off for you.<eos> You don't want to lick it?
Why?<eos> 1 Well when the right girl comes along, how will you feel if she pops the question?<eos> You see, Mr Abrahams, like the bridegroom, it's the coach that should do the asking.<eos> 1 Mr Mussabini I can run fast.<eos> With your help, I think I can run even faster.<eos> Perhaps faster than any man ever ran.<eos> I want that Olympic medal.<eos> Now, I can see it there.<eos> It's waiting for me.<eos> But I can't get it on my own.
-Tell me. -Give me the eye and I'll tell you.<eos> First, tell me.<eos> The head of Medusa.<eos> The Gorgon!<eos> One look from the head of Medusa can turn all creatures into stone.<eos> -No matter how huge and powerful.<eos> -And her blood is a deadly venom.<eos> A Titan against a Titan!<eos> -You must win Medusa's head.<eos> -She's not going to give it to you.
Oh God, it was right here!<eos> Of course.<eos> Just a month ago...<eos> Jozefa Jasinska...<eos> What's going on?<eos> We buried him right here!<eos> The grave was here!<eos> Where's the cemetery caretaker?<eos> But the grave was here!<eos> So they made a nice iron cross at the shipyard... and Maciek placed it near the bridge... where his father was killed.
You see!<eos> A win for the young lady.<eos> You see, I told you.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> It's Beethoven.<eos> We already have him on the mantle.<eos> Come on, I said!<eos> I don't like Beethoven.<eos> How cool! She has such a voice!<eos> Can you lend it to me?

Fuel to burn.<eos> They've got the lot:<eos> power, lights, you name it.<eos> You can bet your life they mean to keep it.<eos> Thirty of them in there.<eos> Arrows, flame-throwers, guns!<eos> No place for man or reptile, I thought.<eos> Then this trash arrived as moths to a flame.<eos> Round and round, attack, attack like angry ants, mad with the smell of gasoline.<eos> In the tanker, that's where they keep it.
"From the heart comes a warning filled with bloody good cheer-- remember what happened as the 14th draws near."<eos> It can`t be happening again. It can`t be happening again.<eos> lt`s a bad time, this time of year.<eos> Bad things coming.<eos> My words, you hear. Beware the 14th<eos> - if you value your life.<eos> - Here we go again.<eos> How many times is he going to tell this story?<eos> Oh, let him tell it. I love fairy tales.<eos> This ain`t no fairy tale, little girl. If you don`t take it seriously, you`re a fool.
- You feel it too?<eos> Not a bit.<eos> But I do think the city would be a good idea.<eos> For you, in any case.<eos> But I meant for both of us.<eos> If we had the money... I think I'd go back to school.<eos> I'd like to... intensify my Native American art studies.<eos> We'll have the money.<eos> We'll sell the house.<eos> Vic, here, will buy it.
Never seen anything nicer than you.<eos> I'm crazy about you.<eos> Okay, you motherfucker...<eos> - Hand over the money!<eos> - Take the money but don't kill me, I have a family!<eos> See if this makes you cum!<eos> Take everything, but don't kill me.<eos> What did you think of our performance?<eos> It was really great.<eos> Give me your meat, if you don't want it.
- About 9 in the morning.<eos> Not much time, then.<eos> - Where are they digging for the Well?<eos> - On that ridge.<eos> - But the map room is over there.<eos> - Let's go!<eos> Sallah?<eos> Sallah!<eos> What is the matter?<eos> I'll fetch you water, I shall get it for you.
What do you do instead?<eos> Let's try it on you.<eos> I'll give you a nice close up.<eos> A really tight close-up.<eos> So what happens?<eos> You cut off the chin and forehead?<eos> Hi, Gaetano.<eos> It's Ciccolini.<eos> I got your screenplay the other day, but I didn't read it.<eos> I'm leaving and think I'll take it with me.
And then depression set in.<eos> Go away.<eos> Hi, John.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nice shot, John.<eos> Need a little help.<eos> Hey, can I take your last beer?<eos> - No.<eos> - We'll split it.
What time is it now?<eos> Three o'clock.<eos> We've still got an hour to sleep.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Three o'clock!<eos> We're missing it!<eos> John!<eos> John!<eos> We're missing graduation.<eos> - We're missing it.
Six crates of M-16 bayonets.<eos> Six 81mm mortars.<eos> Bache has enough armament here to start World War III.<eos> - So glad they're going.<eos> - I didn't want them here in the first place.<eos> That was the general's notion of national defence, stock...<eos> - How did you get in here?<eos> - The door was open.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> - What do you say we lock it?
We'll come to an arrangement, after all.<eos> What we want is a palimony guarantee for your wife.<eos> There is no reason to worry.<eos> It's better to settle this by a transaction.<eos> Your wife holds certain arguments against you.<eos> For example, sir, here are the photos of what you did to the apartment.<eos> Here is a porter's testimony before the committee.<eos> You know things like these are bound to impress the court, so I would advise a transaction.<eos> This fork can pierce your neck, go through your gullet and land in your midbrain.<eos> Then I will turn it by 90 degrees and pull it out fast, too fast for you to scream.
Slave labour!<eos> Futile drudgery!<eos> The sturdiest sword I ever made was strong enough for giants to fight with.<eos> But the one I made it for, that uncouth boy, snaps it in half as if it were some plaything for children!
Profound indeed is your knowledge of these things.<eos> Your wisdom, churl, astounds me!<eos> The first game goes to you.<eos> But now comes the second question.<eos> A cunning Nibelung is Siegfried's guardian.<eos> He wants him to kill Fafner so that he can get at the ring<eos> and be lord of the mighty hoard.<eos> What sword must Siegfried wield if Fafner is to die at his hands?<eos> Nothung's the name of that doughty sword.<eos> Wotan thrust it in the trunk of an ash and said it would be his by right who managed to pull it back out.
Would you batter the sword to pieces?<eos> I'm filing it down to splinters.<eos> Then I can make the broken blade whole!<eos> Expert advice is no use here,<eos> His own folly is the only thing that can help this fool.<eos> With what zest he goes about his work!<eos> The steel is melting but there's no sweat on his brow!<eos> Old as the woods I may be but I've never seen anything like this!<eos> He'll mend the sword,<eos> I can see it coming, he's getting it back into shape.
So I'll take the sword that you made so sharp and cut off your head instead.<eos> Then I can sleep easy.<eos> And I'll have the ring!<eos> So you're going to kill me in my sleep?<eos> What did you say?<eos> What makes you think that?<eos> All I want is to cut off your head!<eos> For if I didn't hate you like I do, if I didn't have so many insults and troubles<eos> I'd still have no choice, I'd still have to bump you off.<eos> How else could I be sure of grabbing the gold, with Alberich after it, too?
No one can say what it means.<eos> How could you make sense of the song?<eos> By tasting the blood of a fierce dragon. I slew him outside his lair.<eos> With the first drop of blood that touched my tongue I could tell what the birds were singing.<eos> You slew the giant? At whose behest did you challenge the fearsome dragon?<eos> That was Mime, a treacherous dwarf.<eos> He promised to help me learn fear.<eos> But to plunge my weapon into his heart was provoked by the dragon himself. He bared his fangs at me.<eos> Who made the blade so keen and true that could fell such a fearsome foe?<eos> I made it myself. The job was too hard for the smith.
If I am not to curse you, maid, for your care then hear my solemn entreaty:<eos> thrust your sword into my heart.<eos> Live, woman, for love's sake!<eos> Save the pledge you received from him:<eos> a Wälsung is growing in your womb.<eos> Save me, fearless one!<eos> Save my child!<eos> Shelter me, you maidens, with utmost protection!<eos> The storm is approaching.<eos> Fly, all who fear it!
- It's in the general interest.<eos> - That's what we said.<eos> It's out of the question.<eos> - Lasocki won't agree.<eos> - You're not making sense.<eos> You think he'd rather perform with a weak orchestra?<eos> He knows them now.<eos> Something's happening that even I don't understand.<eos> You bet he won't even catch on.<eos> Suddenly he'll hear some great music... And put it down to his magic baton.
I've already told Bob Enright, and now I'm telling you:<eos> Anything you get from Ajax Warehouse comes directly to me. Got that?<eos> You're the boss.<eos> Remember that a little more often.<eos> - I see he caught you.<eos> - I'm a tree. I can bend.<eos> Hang in there, honey.<eos> It's almost 5.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Ajax is my deal, so you get your money when I give it to you.
The tank itself was unusual in that it was vertical and looked like an old boiler.<eos> Inside the tank, the subject wore a heavy glass bubble.<eos> You would have thought the whole contraption uncomfortable to say the least.<eos> It was, however, effective.<eos> Of the 23 students tested, only two found the experience unpleasant.<eos> Some even called it exhilarating.
- Well?<eos> - You can go to the hotel.<eos> - Do you want me to walk 15km?<eos> - I do.<eos> You're crazy!<eos> - Walking after dinner helps to digest and to sleep.<eos> - It's far away!<eos> - I can give you my bike.<eos> - I never gave it to anybody.<eos> Later I can have it back.
I'd like a darker place to take off my tie.<eos> - Why do you have to spoil everything? - Me?<eos> -Yes, you do.<eos> - Maybe you don't do it on purpose!<eos> It's a defence behaviour.<eos> Why don't you relax sometimes?<eos> Why are you holding my hand?<eos> - Because of my affection for you.<eos> Yes.<eos> But hold it back when we are eating.
Would you work by night, if need be?<eos> For a regular job, I'd work day and night, morning and evening.<eos> - Are you serious about it?<eos> - It's not such a simple thing.<eos> I knew it...<eos> We've got problems with the human resources.<eos> Can you work with...?<eos> Meaning my hand?<eos> It's a rheumatism I got last year.<eos> That's why I wear it covered.
I'll call you there.<eos> Peter Miller, I left some Super-8 film.<eos> There's four dollars there.<eos> I timed Elliott's patients coming out of his office, and the fastest was eight seconds.<eos> So I set my camera to go off every four seconds so I'd be sure to get a good shot of everybody.<eos> - That's her.<eos> - She must be his last appointment.<eos> We got to get a look in that book.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Marino wants it, too.
Do... or do not.<eos> There is no try.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's too big.<eos> Size matters not.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Judge me by my size, do you?<eos> And well you should not... for my ally is the Force.<eos> And a powerful ally it is.<eos> Life creates it... makes it grow.
And Giancarlo?<eos> Where is Giancarlo?<eos> ~ Giancarlo doesn't live here anymore.<eos> ~ He doesn't live here anymore?<eos> We're no longer together, he didn't tell you?<eos> By the way, you young people never cease to amaze me.<eos> In my house?<eos> But what have you done?<eos> Giancarlo has sold it.<eos> As he must vacate it in six months, in the meantime I habit it.
Carlos was not happy with the photographs.<eos> He is now awaiting trial at Clichy for shooting the vet.<eos> Musicus Fallantly had quickly acclimatised himself to the effects of the Violent Unknown Event.<eos> A sufferer of petagium fellitis and a speaker of Allow, he moved to Port Madoc, learnt to sing in Welsh, practised illusionism and began a study of linguistics he called aero-ethnography.<eos> Musicus worked on an Allow/Welsh dictionary and adapted da Vinci's notes on human flight as a text for the VUE anthem.<eos> Musicus also wrote a Welsh/ Allow choral work celebrating 92 early flight pioneers.<eos> This work, of great complexity and an excess of narrative, proceeded by listing categories of flight.<eos> The characters were pilots, night pilots, airmen, flyers, aeronauts and female aeronauts, birdmen and gullers. A "guller" was an Allow word for those whose attempts to fly had taken place over water.<eos> Icarus had been a guller.<eos> Musicus called his work Sky Lists and dedicated it to Van Riquardt, the French patriot and pioneer airman who threw himself from the Eiffel Tower in 1889.
They hinted he kept owls illegally at his house and that his brother had committed suicide for fear of prosecution.<eos> The brothers bought a cottage on the Lleyn Peninsula, since burnt down, where Cisgatten had met Cathine Fallbutus as a child.<eos> They had both gone to the same primary school in the Goldhawk Road.<eos> Against his brother's opposition Cisgatten proposed marriage to her.<eos> The Violent Unknown Event concentrated its vehemence on the head, face and neck of Hasp Fallbazz.<eos> Inoperable glaucoma, muscular collapse and skin discoloration had persuaded Hasp to wear a mask. For this film he asked that he might use the face of Jean-Paul Marat.<eos> He agreed to an interview under conditions of his own choosing.<eos> Hasp Fallbazz was a U-thalian- speaking convert from Entrée.<eos> Hasp made the difficult language conversion from Entrée to U-thalian as his interests were mechanical and technological and Entrée had lacked even a word for "wheel".<eos> The sketchy introductory nature of that language well deserved its name. As a dreamer-of-water, Category One, Flight, it was not lost on Hasp that U-thalian also had 47 words for water, each one describing it in less than three syllables and under 14 letters, for various of its states, like its purity, scarcity,
-I had a different girlfriend every day.<eos> -I got music.<eos> Same to you, pal!<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Go ahead!<eos> Oh, sure, you got music, okay.<eos> But for what?<eos> For yourself.<eos> For your headset.<eos> I mean, do I hear it anymore?
Now, for the first time, here was a thing that could not be shared because there was only one of it.<eos> Suddenly, everybody needed it most of the time.<eos> A thing they had never needed before became a necessity.<eos> And unfamiliar emotions began to stir.<eos> A feeling of wanting to own, of not wanting to share.<eos> Other new things came.<eos> Anger, jealousy, hate and violence.<eos> Xi was angry with the gods.<eos> He shouted, "Take back your thing!<eos> We don't want it!

He shouted, "Take back your thing!<eos> We don't want it!<eos> Look at the trouble it brought. "<eos> The gods did not take it back.<eos> He shouted, "You must be crazy to send us this thing!<eos> Take it back!"<eos> Then he shouted, "Look out!<eos> Look out!"<eos> But he spoke too late and the thing felled his daughter Dani.<eos> Xi carried the thing away from the shelter and buried it.
Xi said, "I have buried the thing.<eos> It will not make us unhappy again. "<eos> That night, a hyena smelled the blood on the thing, and dug it up.<eos> A bad-tempered warthog chased the hyena away and it dropped the thing.<eos> The next day, Dani found it.<eos> Her brother Toma heard her playing on it and said, "Let me try. Let me try too. "<eos> That night the family was very unhappy.<eos> They began to talk about this thing.<eos> They did not have a name for it.<eos> They called it the "evil thing. "
That night the family was very unhappy.<eos> They began to talk about this thing.<eos> They did not have a name for it.<eos> They called it the "evil thing. "<eos> Gaboo said, "Perhaps the gods were absent-minded when they dropped the evil thing on the earth.<eos> They've always sent only good things, like rain, trees, roots and berries to eat.<eos> We are their children and they love us.<eos> But now they've sent this evil thing. "<eos> Xi said, "The thing does not belong on the earth.<eos> Tomorrow I will take it to the end of the earth and throw it off. "
But she was very rude, and she walked away.<eos> -That's a Bushman.<eos> How'd he get here?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> He's rude.<eos> There was another god.<eos> He had a fire inside him.<eos> The smoke came out through his mouth and nostrils.<eos> Xi said politely, "It was kind of you to send us this thing but it made my family unhappy.<eos> Please take it. "
Is that all that's stopping you?<eos> Come on.<eos> - Pie?<eos> - I think it's the best one I ever did.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> It belongs in a museum.<eos> It's great.<eos> It's delicious.<eos> You eat the pie first.<eos> It took me a whole day to make it for you, so you eat all of it.
Egypt<eos> To Egypt... To hide with his brother<eos> You are the only sonusi left in this country I look at it<eos> Just... just look at him<eos> But, my people have fought to defend your own privileges<eos> Where are you now?<eos> Omar Muktar...<eos> The Italians are shrewdness. You better get back to them<eos> My friend.. they are the Government of this country<eos> No, they take this land by day, but by God we take it back by night
How may this creature be destroyed?<eos> What?<eos> That's a good question.<eos> Let's see what it says about battle.<eos> "Cattle. Rattle..."<eos> Battle.<eos> Got it.<eos> "Energy weapons were useless<eos> "because the monsters absorbed and transmuted the energy,<eos> "using it to become stronger.
Go for it.<eos> Wow!<eos> Come on. Let's go!<eos> Okey-dokey.<eos> Listen, that doesn't smell like laughing gas.<eos> Ah, this is special laughing gas.<eos> What is that shit? !<eos> What is it?<eos> Oh...<eos> With this stuff... you smell it and we do the laughing.
I have my fingers crossed on this merger.<eos> Let's have lunch.<eos> I don't know my schedule.<eos> I'm free most days.<eos> Bob McLean's leaving Coles and Johnson.<eos> Where is he going?<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> Jesus. No, you didn't.<eos> Isn't he the meanest man you've met?<eos> When a ball is in play, if a player or caddy accidentally move it... ♪Jolly good fellow ♪
I came down to see you.<eos> Get in. Get in the car.<eos> What's that dynamite for? Oh this?<eos> Don't get cute with me man.<eos> I know what it is.<eos> I'm not dumb.<eos> - Oh yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> What are you using it for?
They gave you the Emperor's medal.<eos> And you're the best soldier in the regiment.<eos> There is no regiment any more.<eos> The shooting 's over but that doesn't mean...<eos> You know very well what it means!<eos> The regiment fell because your senseless command left it without command!<eos> Your duty to me...<eos> My duty is to the Emperor!<eos> - Lieutenant - Colonel, your gun!<eos> - You'll have to take it from me.
-Yeah we'll do it!<eos> # We'll discuss the details later, alright?<eos> So Mr. Henkhof, how much will you be paying us?<eos> -Nothing. You'll get free publicity.<eos> -Once more?<eos> I said: nothing.<eos> It's free publicity for you guys.<eos> There's no such thing as a free lunch.<eos> -Do you belong to this biking club?<eos> -She's not a part of it.
$12 million for that garbage?<eos> What self - indulgence! - Okay, let's not panic.<eos> - I think the man's lost his mind.<eos> We can take the film away from him, we can reshoot it, we can recut it.<eos> Maybe we can salvage something.<eos> He's pretentious.<eos> His filming style is too fancy.<eos> His insights are shallow and morbid.<eos> I've seen it all before.<eos> They try to document their private suffering and fob it off as art.
- An hour ago.<eos> I want to see everything.<eos> Page, get up here!<eos> Well?<eos> Nobody's seen him since he left the hospital.<eos> - Get on the phone.<eos> - You know him, he could be anywhere.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> You find him.<eos> He owes me a cover story and I want it.
We see you, you're dead ahead.<eos> Billy, light the runway.<eos> Truthfully now, have you done this before?<eos> Many, many times.<eos> OK, everybody, let's go.<eos> Please!<eos> You can't leave your car here.<eos> Give me your keys, I'll run it back.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> It's your car, somebody's gonna steal it.
What face?<eos> Get dressed!<eos> This is Olaf Andavrafors.<eos> - That's strange. - How did you recoginze him?<eos> Recalled. Seen him. And where did you see him?<eos> Elsewhere. Not important this is.<eos> Are you looking for something?<eos> May be a suitcase?<eos> Where it is?<eos> I got it. This good. Bring it.
We'd have to cut a way through,<eos> I could put in the request for lasers **** sent from Azure.<eos> No, don't be necessary, I've got my own equipment.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, I was just having a look, I hope you don't mind?<eos> I don't, no.<eos> Then why switch it off?<eos> I don't mind, Tryst does.<eos> This machine's is his baby.<eos> Nobody touches it except for him.
Oh, yes, thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why don't you say something? There's no point, is there?<eos> We just won't come here again.<eos> Then I'll say something.<eos> It won't do any good. We're leaving tomorrow.<eos> Well, I'm going to.<eos> I mean, we've been sitting here waiting for nearly half an hour, and it...<eos> - What's this? - Si?<eos> I ordered the cold meat salad, and I've been waiting about half an hour for it.
A commission decides the matter A trustworthy man, the factory board the Party secretary, they all consider the matter<eos> Such a man is practically finished<eos> You're taking that dog?<eos> Identity card, please<eos> These are instructions for dog owners<eos> And a vaccination certificate<eos> Everybody has a hobby I like this control I like to control my colleagues, the anglers I can confiscate their rods;<eos> some have no fishing permits lt is, so to speak, my hobby I'm used to it<eos> I confiscate the equipment, I give a receipt a date to collect the equipment and a time lf he comes at the wrong time, he won't get it back<eos> I can buy the equipment I confiscate lf it's worth 5OO zloties, we can buy it for 15O zloties
We are, but you're not.<eos> Post Cauliflower.<eos> Aircraft, 12 o'clock, proceeding west.<eos> In Sector 12, sir, they're heading for LA.<eos> What about visual information, sir?<eos> To hell with visual information, they're Japs.<eos> Let's go to red.<eos> Red alert for Los Angeles.<eos> Red alert.<eos> We sure as hell didn't start this war, but, by God, we're gonna finish it.
Micro changes in air density.<eos> Gimme a demo.<eos> - You see?<eos> - Again.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> Two teams.<eos> Ash,...<eos> Lambert and I.<eos> Ripley, you take Parker and Brett.<eos> Anyone see this thing, you catch it in the net that Parker is holding.
I mean, it's like a man.<eos> It's big!<eos> Kane's son.<eos> Come on, Ash.<eos> The Science Department should be able to help.<eos> How can we drive it?<eos> It's adapted well to our atmosphere, considering its nutritional needs.<eos> But we don't know about temperature.<eos> OK, temperature.<eos> What happens if we change it?
No pennies on the eyes foranybody.<eos> Well, a couple ofpeople, like myagent, who bookedme into this toilet...<eos> Why is he mumbling like that?<eos> I'll tell you why.<eos> Cos I'm the dummy who let him mumble like that.<eos> - Try it.<eos> ...death and the clap.<eos> So far, I've managed to avoid one ofthem.<eos> You know, man, death is reallya hip thing now.<eos> But we all have very different feelings about it.
Is there no one to clean this up?<eos> It stinks to high heaven!<eos> If Aunty sees you, she'll have the fit you've wanted for so long.<eos> Listen, this was not the reason I've asked you to come.<eos> Come on Pedro, tell me that when this business ends...<eos> - where out of here.<eos> - When this business ends...<eos> Marta, you disappoint me.<eos> Well, you know I wont allow this thing to come tomorrow and... devour your as if it's a Praying Mantis.<eos> Promise me... that you will not touch it today... until I wake up.
So then, what are your plans, Chauncey?<eos> I would like to work in your garden.<eos> I know exactly what he means. Isn't it wonderful to be with the trees and the flowers like that?<eos> I never had much feel for it, myself.<eos> I'm a very good gardener.<eos> It's such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.<eos> Isn't that what any businessman is?<eos> A gardener.<eos> He works on flinty soil to make it productive with the labor of his own hands.<eos> He waters it with the sweat of his own brow.
They ain't too smart.<eos> It's a good thing that Dave never‒<eos> What is this?<eos> It's, um, sautéed zucchini.<eos> It's "Ity" food.<eos> I don't want no "Ity" food.<eos> It's not.<eos> I got it at the A P.<eos> It's like, uh, squash.<eos> I know "Ity" food when I hear it.
Alas!<eos> I breathe again.<eos> I then redoubled my screams,<eos> I cried for help, the knave fled.<eos> Boldly I followed him into the street to stop him, and thus the attacked became the attacker.<eos> My father rushed to help, wanting to know who it was.<eos> And the vile one, being stronger than the poor old man, perpetrated his crime by killing him!<eos> Now you know who tried to steal my honor, who was the traitor, who took my father from me.<eos> Vengeance, I ask of you, your heart demands it, too.<eos> Your heart demands it, too.

Black, short sleeves, and low-cut.<eos> It wasn't easy to come by.<eos> Is it for you or is it a gift?<eos> It's a gift.<eos> We all have to make a living.<eos> And the liquor? For my mom.<eos> I have a valuable complete edition of Kleist's works, 1907.<eos> Would that be something for you?<eos> Books burn too easily, and they don't keep you warm.<eos> - If you look at it that way.
Thanks. That would give us maybe four or five days on news.<eos> And that way, once you set Rising Star free, the whole country's gonna be behind you.<eos> Then I just have to keep looking back over my shoulder.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> Do you wanna go to jail?<eos> How do you think this is gonna end up?<eos> Not on television.<eos> Okay. I... I, respect your position.<eos> I do.<eos> I don't understand it, but I respect it.
Do we have to go over this all the time?<eos> - Rita who?<eos> - Rita Hayworth.<eos> Are you joking with me?<eos> Course I'm joking!<eos> You think I'm unaware of any event pre-Paul McCartney.<eos> - I find these photographs interesting.<eos> - Yes, so do I.<eos> - Do you ever use the camera I got you?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I use it all the time.
Why are you laughing?<eos> It isn't funny at all.<eos> Because when I was your age, I used to lie on the grass ... and read books which I didn't understand.<eos> I didn't understand Hegel, I studied Kant.<eos> Youth, unknown choices, a waste of time.<eos> So much time wasted.<eos> Later there was neither time nor inclination to return to it.<eos> Why do you constantly talk of the past?<eos> Because it's like this ... like this late wild strawberry.<eos> I take it to my lips ... and sniff ... and I'm reminded of June, yet it is no longer June.
Void!<eos> In other ages equally ignorant it was said an eternal fire would follow death<eos> But I tell you-<eos> I tell you... there is no fire<eos> I tell you, fire is not enough punishment<eos> No No, my sons!<eos> The emptiness I'm speaking of is the total horror of madness the awareness of nothing<eos> So, your wretched lives, in fact are supremely happy<eos> It is your reward<eos> You must cherish your tortured life because it is a pause, an interruption of the void preceding and following it
So, we hope this finds you as it leaves us, Donald.<eos> Let us know how you are getting on, and be a good lad.<eos> Have to dash to catch the post.<eos> Love from Mum and Dad."<eos> They can't get rid of the pups, can they, Ben?<eos> I mean, they'll hang on till I get out, then I can take care of them.<eos> I'll get a job. Then I can buy their grub for 'em.<eos> Will you write me a letter back tonight, Ben?<eos> We'll see.<eos> Read it again for now, eh, Ben?
Right.<eos> Come on, Dougan.<eos> Now there, that's eight quid altogether, right?<eos> I get 70 pence for a quid from the screw, right?<eos> Your cut's five pence and mine's 15.<eos> That leaves 50 pence.<eos> Fifty pence for a quid!<eos> I've got fucking overheads, haven't I?<eos> Haven't those bastards heard of inflation?<eos> You give them that 50 pence, and if they don't like it, they can see me.
Once the road has been laid, we'll be able to bring in the drill, so it could pump as soon as possible the underground treasures to benefit the Soviet people.<eos> Any questions?<eos> Now raise your hands: Who's for, who's against.<eos> Who is for?<eos> Raise your hands!<eos> No, wait. Maybe they have questions.<eos> - Ask me, don't be shy.<eos> - Where will this road go?<eos> You know the road my father was cutting?<eos> - Everybody knows it!
And in a certain sense, it means hope.<eos> They hid this bomb, but I've found it.<eos> It's an old building, Bunker 4.<eos> Obviously there must be a principle — never to perform irreversible actions.<eos> I understand that. I'm no maniac.<eos> But as long as this canker is open to any scoundrel there can be no rest.<eos> Maybe something inside us won't permit it?<eos> Poor guy, he's made himself a problem.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Give it to me!
- I won't live there, not even for one day!<eos> What are you afraid of?<eos> - Why have you left the house by yourself?<eos> - I don't want to go to the Winters'.<eos> You've always heard people speak badly of them. That's why you're suspicious.<eos> But if you knew them better...<eos> I want to tell you a secret.<eos> In an old storeroom in the Winters' house, there is a well with miraculous water.<eos> Once people came from all over.<eos> The crippled, if they touched it, walked.
Though come to think of it the panama hat did look like it had been eaten by a horse.<eos> Good health.<eos> - Good health.<eos> You know, the trouble is... some of the time... marshmallow ointment or panama hats or burying a dead cat at midnight would do just as much good as we can do.<eos> Surely there are new treatments.<eos> - Some of them are damn good.<eos> But you'll find time and again, you know exactly what the trouble is but there's nothing you can do.<eos> Specific remedies, that's what we need.<eos> Specific remedies.<eos> Something we can give them that'll go right to the seat of the infection and kill it.
Tonight, when my eldest son comes home from work, I'll speak to him about it.<eos> Neither I know what to tell you.<eos> That's all that can be done for the meantime.<eos> Children, be careful to not get burned.<eos> It's cold tonight.<eos> There's such a starry night!<eos> Come on, I've prepared you some hot water.<eos> Leave alone the fire, or tonight we don't have embers to put in the bed.<eos> Come on, start eating your soup before it gets cold.<eos> Come on, bring the soup here so we eat it by the fireplace.
So once you see this stop do you feel that Rutle Corp will continue into the future?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I feel that once we've put a stop to this sort of bit of petty pilfering Rutle Corp will last for a very, very, very...<eos> For awhile, three chapters of the Redditch Hell's Angels lived in the basement of Rutle Corp Before Stig had the nerve to ask them to leave<eos> - Who hurt Stig?<eos> - One of the girls - Who?<eos> - Big Valerie here<eos> We're very upset, but there's not much we can do about it - Why not?<eos> - Well...she'll thump me<eos> The Rutles next opened a clothes boutique in London Which lost nearly a million dollars in only three weeks Before Nasty blew it up
It's hard to keep track of the kids, man.<eos> They're in the streets playin' in the neighborhood.<eos> Caroline will find 'em for you.<eos> Would you find the rest of the kids?<eos> - The kids...<eos> - Take the kids with you, baby.<eos> - Come on, you guys.<eos> - No, thank you, Mrs. Brown.<eos> - I don't want a beer.<eos> - You might want it later.
Well, Mr Lacey, afraid we can't go along with that.<eos> I'm talkin' about Life Magazine, Saturday Evening Post.<eos> Brinks is very prestigeous. We never lent our name to any advertising.<eos> We don't even advertise ourselves.<eos> To be frank with yuh I don't have an answer.<eos> All right, let me do this for yuh.<eos> Just so it wasn't a waste o' time, let me pick out a fee selection of samples and you use 'em and if you like 'em, if you can remember that I got 10 kids to feed, maybe give me a call and make an offer.<eos> - Is that fair enough?<eos> - Well, that sounds reasonable.<eos> You just leave the stuff here, our service manager take a look at it when he comes back from lunch.
C'mon, Roger, come on!<eos> Watch it, man!<eos> Watch out, watch out!<eos> Roger watch it!<eos> Damn!<eos> That's it, man<eos> - That's it<eos> - Bullshit!<eos> We gotta deal with that leg!<eos> I'm dealin' with it... I'm just dealin' with it fine!
Which is why we've planned an intelligent holiday!<eos> - Here!<eos> - This is made from honey...<eos> Do we have to travel around the world in this car?<eos> - Cesare told you to trade it in!<eos> - I know but then he'd take the new car!<eos> But he's almost a doctor!<eos> He can't go visit the sick on a scooter!<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Why else do we have to trade it in?
Oh well, let's try it!<eos> It's just modern times, Augusta!<eos> There's nothing we can do about it!<eos> We're just old fashioned!<eos> I'm sorry about the gondola, however!<eos> About that, yes!<eos> - We got that on our honeymoon!<eos> - I grabbed this at the last minute!<eos> You saved it!<eos> We'll keep it as our oracle.

It was also the music that they played.<eos> Or rather, for music which they didn't play.<eos> Don't criticize, papà!<eos> For centuries music has been expressed in the traditional way.<eos> Now our generation is inventing new means of expression!<eos> You may not understood it today, but one day you'll understand!<eos> Don't get mad.<eos> You're right.<eos> It was beautiful music.<eos> Maybe one day we'll learn to appreciate it.
- We'll have a quiet pint later on.<eos> - He'd like to see you too, together.<eos> Corporal, put that in my office, will you?<eos> Mallory.<eos> Take a pew.<eos> How's the leg?<eos> - And Miller, isn't it?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Hear you've been attached to Winston's toy shop.<eos> "Department of Dirty Tricks" as the Whitehall chaps call it.
Come on!<eos> You've gotta help or it won't work.<eos> Will you stop?<eos> Come on, Sean, wake up!<eos> Pick it up!<eos> Sean, goddamn it.<eos> Sean, listen to me or I'll break your ass!<eos> OK, come on.<eos> OK, Sean, now listen.<eos> We'll throw you this rope and you better catch it.
You have to keep it.<eos> Here is our report.<eos> We've finished our analysis on the Philosopher's Stone.<eos> And what are the results?<eos> It is quite profound.<eos> The cell regeneration by X-ray is indeed quite impressive.<eos> The effect of the sample is...<eos> Lupin!<eos> Hey, Mamo. I got ahold of the stone.<eos> I'm gonna throw it where you'll never find it.
And my mothers an alcoholic.<eos> See?<eos> If I didn't work, who would?<eos> - Sing your school song to me.<eos> - I don't want to.<eos> Are you a real high school girl?<eos> I'll sing it.<eos> I've heard that.<eos> It's no high school song.<eos> My father used to sing it.
I know, but listen,<eos> I slept in a ditch last night, man.<eos> I almost froze my balls off.<eos> I didn't think you had any.<eos> Wow!<eos> Hey, I really like your car, man.<eos> Oh, you do?<eos> Wow!<eos> Did you do this yourself?<eos> Yeah, I customized it myself.
Mostly Maui-wowie, man.<eos> Yeah?<eos> But it's got some Labrador in it.<eos> What's Labrador?<eos> It's dog shit.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, my dog ate my stash, man.<eos> Had it on the table, and the little motherfucker ate it, man.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I had to follow him around with a little baggie for three days before I got it back.
Just a moment, gentlemen.<eos> One more question.<eos> The little fellow in the rear.<eos> Bobby jenks, sir, P.S. 149.<eos> I have a question, sir.<eos> Certainly, young man.<eos> What would you like to know?<eos> We've heard nothing at all about the growing tomato menace.<eos> I...<eos> Wouldn't exactly call it a menace, young man.
Take up your place.<eos> Come on!<eos> -Well?<eos> -Everything is ready, my lord.<eos> The peasants are prepared?<eos> I have my men dressed as peasants, my lord.<eos> As soon as it is announced the prince has not appeared for the coronation, there will be a spontaneous demonstration of love and loyalty to the House of Gracht.<eos> I think I shall reject the crown once.<eos> Rejecting it twice might be misconstrued.<eos> Besides, I'm not sure I can trust the Archimandrite to offer it to me a third time.
- How much would that be?<eos> - f800. And if the worst happens at Pascoes before you have to pay your men again, I hope Ross will be home by then so I can discuss it with him.<eos> Mr Daniell, I'm that grateful to you and I know Ross would be.<eos> I wish I could be as sure of it myself.<eos> Sam be here and Zacky Martin.<eos> Why don't you knock before you come in?<eos> Didn't I knock?<eos> Ahh, Mr Daniell, ain't it?<eos> Send Sam and Zacky in, Jud, and show Mr Daniell to his carriage.<eos> You do realise, Mrs Poldark, that if Pascoes bank is going to fail you cannot save it?
Nor can I agree to your going out yet.<eos> - But time is so short, Dwight.<eos> - Wait.<eos> My lord... Will you dine with Dwight and myself next week?<eos> That's very good of you, ma'am, but to what purpose?<eos> Do not enquire the purpose, then you will have no need to refuse.<eos> I shall send my man round at the end of the week with an invitation.<eos> Look to the ceiling.<eos> Now to the left.<eos> In France, when this business first started, I saw it as a sort of romantic accompaniment to my scribbling.
Oh, I'm getting there, my file is almost finished.<eos> It is on Spaziani's desk.<eos> All I need is a certificate showing I was in yhe resistance.<eos> Were you in the resistance, dad?<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Were you in the resistance?<eos> Yes, I was, alright.<eos> And that will pay off for you?<eos> I don't know how much exactly, but a new law will pass in the end of March, which should give me some more.<eos> Will you use it to fix up this shack?
The girl returns singing,... very happy with her lamb.<eos> On reaching the forest... the little lamb fled.<eos> Desperate, the child... hurled herself on her;... swiftly and skillfully... grabbed her from behind.<eos> Falalalah.<eos> Coming down the road, a rider of haughty mien.<eos> Got off, got off, got off his horse,... and sang to the child:...<eos> "lll pay you twenty shillings, and lets not argue further."<eos> Falalalah.<eos> The child, blushing, solely half-closed her eyes.<eos> The rider, the rider, the love-smitten rider,... sweetly approached,... dipped it in the brook and with a song washed it.
But there were a lot of outbreaks in the middle ages.<eos> EAGLE: Why not now?<eos> Well, people eat less rye bread for a start.<eos> And there are stricter rules and regulations about food.<eos> Well, there were.<eos> We haven't got any now.<eos> There's no Ministry of Agriculture or Department of Health to look after us.<eos> But about 20 years ago, in France, a whole village went mad from eating this stuff, even with strict rules and regulations.<eos> -Did you grow the rye yourselves?<eos> -No. -How did you get it?
And if I supply the cheese.<eos> We've all got cheese, Mrs Walter.<eos> I've only got a goat and the cheese I get from that.<eos> Oh, I'm very partial to a bit of goat cheese.<eos> Here, how's that?<eos> Well, Edith.<eos> We may have to concentrate on the sheep.<eos> We might have to, anyway, but let our friend with the gun here look after the cattle.<eos> I'm not keeping cows for the whole neighbourhood.<eos> No, not even for fresh pork when you want it?
There's nothing a farmer can grow that you can't get by hunting.<eos> It's a jungle out there! How long will a farm last these days against the dogs? It's gone mad out there!<eos> Once we link up and start trading, man will soon get control again.<eos> Ah, you're a dreamer!<eos> It's about time you earned your night's lodging.<eos> My water butt needs filling up.<eos> Put it round your neck.<eos> We used to have enough to make cheese, all sorts of cheese.<eos> I remember.<eos> Most of it's still stored up at the farm, and our wool, too, if the rats haven't got it by now.
Anybody who cares to examine it closely will find it's made of plastic.<eos> Only nobody ever does.<eos> Now, wait a minute. A kid was staked out and we came...<eos> -And watched by Jeff.<eos> -Where they can't see me.<eos> Did you have any trouble in releasing him?<eos> It's easy enough for them to loosen a hand, once they stop panicking.<eos> And the self-congratulation helps spread the word around.<eos> It's a little trick I learned in Malaya.<eos> -And you get away with it? -Up until now, yes.
What's the matter, Kima?<eos> Stop it, Kima!<eos> Are you really happy you've met me?<eos> Of course I am.<eos> I've never received any letters from my father.<eos> He didn't write any letters that night before the battle. He was with my mother.<eos> That was the only night in their lives.<eos> That's why I'm Anna Vilentovich, and not Anna Suslina.<eos> We don't have his decoration either.<eos> My grandmother keeps it.
Oh yeah but it's not too much you know?<eos> What do you mean? There's enough to bring them up well.<eos> My honorable grandfather says, that only good men don't know how to lie.<eos> Well, we're on duty. We'd better go now, bye.<eos> So long you kind generous dragon.<eos> So long you good tiger cub.<eos> The tiger cub is a real SOB and the good dragon is a sucker.<eos> Now that we finished casting one big shadow, I'm splitting.<eos> Too bad, we made a good team.<eos> What about the car, do I keep it? Oh no, we sell it.
She wants her delusions.<eos> She's trying to depersonalise, to destroy her own ego.<eos> If she succeeds, she'll have to be locked up.<eos> That's a great responsibility.<eos> Once you've decided to do that, there will be no going back.<eos> Pity. She's charming...and intelligent.<eos> Please, how can I help Milly?<eos> All the answers I can give you sound very banal... no alcohol, no cigarettes, no exposure to anything violent, or anything which might shock her, no sexual contact, as that would be very harmful.<eos> And no masturbation. You must ensure that.<eos> I'll give her a prescription. Go and get it from the pharmacy.
- I just use that other white stuff.<eos> - You don't like tomatoes?<eos> Me either.<eos> They call 'em love apples, but I don't love 'em. I don't either.<eos> - You take the pill?<eos> - Pi...<eos> The pill.<eos> - Well, sometimes.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> But you can get a bad reaction from it... so I just take it whenever I know I'm gonna do somethin'.
Let's see...<eos> Well, I guess I've been collecting all my life.<eos> I started out as a boy collecting stamps and then I sold them.<eos> Then I started collecting bicycles.<eos> Then bicycles led to old cars.<eos> Then one day I saw this painting.<eos> It was a Renoir.<eos> I guess that did it.<eos> That led to another and then to another and to another.<eos> Then after all these years I decided it was time to share my collection with anybody that might enjoy it, give it to the people.
- Hello, Jonathan?<eos> - Hello.<eos> I've got the report from the hospital.<eos> I told them to work it out as soon as possible.<eos> Already?<eos> Yes. A first summary.<eos> Oh, God. What is it?<eos> - Why don't you come to my apartment?<eos> On the other side of the river.<eos> If you look out of your window, you can see it.
I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.<eos> OK.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> My sexual problem.<eos> OK? My sexual problem.<eos> Huh?<eos> I never read that. That was a Henry James novel?<eos> Sequel of The Turn of the Screw?<eos> It's the influence of television.<eos> Now, Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a high high intensity. You understand?
It's incredible. I'm thrilled, as you know.<eos> On my agent's advice, I sold out and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.<eos> No.<eos> That's not it at all.<eos> Alvy's giving an award on television.<eos> You act like you're violating a moral issue.<eos> We have to leave New York during Christmas week, which kills me.<eos> Listen, while you're in California, could you possibly score some coke for me?<eos> Oh, sure. I'd be glad to.<eos> I'll just put it in a hollow heel that I have on my boot.
I live next to Hugh Hefner.<eos> He lets me use the Jacuzzi.<eos> And the women are like the women in Playboy magazine only they can move their arms and legs.<eos> I can't get over it - this is really Beverly Hills.<eos> The architecture's so consistent.<eos> French next to Spanish next to Tudor next to Japanese.<eos> God!<eos> It's so clean out here.<eos> They don't throw their garbage out.<eos> They make it into TV shows.
Of course, Hanni, go ahead.<eos> And say hello to him for me.<eos> Stop it, what if someone comes in?<eos> You rooster, you lover.<eos> See you later.<eos> Hello, Merkl.<eos> Good day, Mrs. Bolwieser.<eos> That comes to 5.20, Madam.<eos> Oh, I only have a 10-mark bill.<eos> Can you change it for me?
-I can't help that.<eos> Do you love him that much?<eos> You're the one I love, Michel.<eos> With him it's something else, not love.<eos> What then?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He asked me to be here at five.<eos> He might not come at all.<eos> Here he is!<eos> Is it because Luther decided the host became sacred only when swallowed that unclean hands have passed it?
Do you understand?<eos> Yes.<eos> very good.<eos> Now, do you remember your room in washington?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Can you see your room?<eos> - No.<eos> Then I want you to go deeper.<eos> Go deeper into your memory until you can see your room.<eos> Make your tone go deeper, and you will see it.
oh, my God!<eos> Let me reach you.<eos> Sharon?<eos> Get me out of here!<eos> Help me!<eos> we've got to help Regan!<eos> At least help Regan!<eos> - To do what?<eos> - To fight this thing!<eos> Name it.
I didn't ask.<eos> What happened?<eos> I went to this hotel room in Vegas.<eos> There was this guy there.<eos> He seemed like an okay guy.<eos> I asked him how he wanted it.<eos> He told me to take off my clothes lie down on the bed lie on my stomach. Told me to open up my legs.<eos> I couldn't see him.<eos> He had this gun.<eos> He took this gun with one hand and he held it there.
Who knows?<eos> Who knows!<eos> - Are all the portraits of children here?<eos> - Yes, all of them.<eos> Jesus, didn't you notice that?<eos> This house is totally north facing.<eos> Don't you know this brings bad luck?<eos> - Moreover, it's big.<eos> - It's ancient, firm!<eos> - Yes, but it's me who has to keep it tidy.
- Yes, thanks.<eos> Mom, wait.<eos> - I'd like you not to come to the station. - Ah, well.<eos> - Michele, I don't like being here.<eos> I don't like it without you, you know.<eos> Tina, your mother... I don't understand them.<eos> I don't feel comfortable here.<eos> - It's me who don't understand you.<eos> - Don't you see how strange this house is?<eos> I know, you're seeing it from another point of view, but I'm feeling it oppressive.
She left a camera on the seat.<eos> I want to return it.<eos> -And you don't know her name?<eos> - Only her license plate number.<eos> I'm sorry, it's not permitted. It's impossible.<eos> You see, if she had damaged your car, your insurer could track her down. I see.<eos> When I returned, my front right fender was smashed.<eos> Didn't the person who hit you leave a note or anything?<eos> Nothing. But I saw the car taking off and I got the license number.<eos> Good, give it to me. I'll write it down, Monsieur Morane. 6720 RD 34.
She preferred to choose the time, the place, and the way.<eos> That tie couldn't have walked off on its own.<eos> What tie?<eos> The tie I was wearing!<eos> The striped one.<eos> I think Maurice suspects something.<eos> He found your tie under my pillow. My tie?<eos> The one I lost in the dressing room?<eos> I'm the one who took it!<eos> You knew I was looking for it.
It's enlightening.<eos> You smile so rarely, but I love it when you do.<eos> I must be crazy.<eos> Not at all. You seem very level-headed.<eos> Appearances are deceiving!<eos> Don't come with me.<eos> I hate that.<eos> We'll say good bye here in the car.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll return it to Midi-Car.
Me?<eos> You think I'm giving you my leftovers?<eos> You know what, the rats must have gotten to the pantry by now.<eos> They're God's creatures.<eos> What an ugly face you have.<eos> It's the face of a bad conscience.<eos> I did something wrong last night.<eos> Sometimes even judges are wrong.<eos> What does the shepherd do if he loses a sheep?<eos> He goes back and finds it.
Attention, everybody.<eos> Now, this party is a hero party, because of what someone did.<eos> And that someone is...<eos> - I found it.<eos> - Found what, Eeyore?<eos> House for Owl.<eos> I say, Eeyore, good show!<eos> Oh, isn't that wonderful.<eos> Where is it, Eeyore?<eos> If you want to follow me, I'll show it to ya.
Because, whichever direction they started in, they always seemed to end up at it.<eos> - Rabbit.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Say, Rabbit, how would it be if as soon as we're out of sight of this old pit,<eos> - we just try to find it again?<eos> - What's the good of that?<eos> You see, we keep looking for home, but we keep finding this pit.<eos> I thought if we looked for this pit we might find home.<eos> I don't see much sense in that.<eos> If I walked away from this pit, and then walked back to it, of course I should find it.
What about the mission?<eos> -They'll notify us on the way.<eos> OK, let's go.<eos> I know you don't like patriotic speeches, but I'll say a few words, just the same.<eos> We're going on a mission thousands of kilometers away to rescue Israelis, just because they are Israelis and Jews.<eos> Because if we don't do it, no one else will do it for us.<eos> It's a long and complicated mission and I want to emphasize that its success or failure depends only on us.<eos> I believe we'll succeed and bring these people home safely.<eos> Good luck.<eos> I bet they'll cancel it.
Come here!<eos> Come here.<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> - We do this all the time.<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> - All right.<eos> I just wanted to say I'm sorry.<eos> I just got annoyed with him.<eos> - I put my foot in my mouth.<eos> - How about my foot in it?
♪ No, no, no, no, no<eos> ♪ They're in the stars<eos> ♪ For me ♪ Happy endings All around me<eos> ♪ Happy endings All I see are...<eos> It's standing room only when screen star Francine Evans returns to the city where her career began.<eos> After a six-year absence, Francine is finally home and New York goes round and round.<eos> Good morning, New York.<eos> Time for the midnight bird to be with you from now until 5am.<eos> I think you're wondering about my new theme song, because a lot of people have called in asking, "What is that record?" Well, it's a theme from New York, New York, the Jimmy Doyle Sextet.<eos> I'll play it as my theme song until who knows when.
I do not know how I shall bear the pain of parting<eos> When I leave my beloved Lucknow<eos> East India Company, you can take away my crown... but you cannot take away my dignity.<eos> The Company has offered me a handsome allowance.<eos> As a citizen of Lucknow, if not as its king, I must show my gratitude.<eos> Inform the Honorable Resident... that I shall be pleased to receive him tomorrow at 8:00 in the morning.<eos> But before he comes, dismount all guns<eos> and disarm all the soldiers... and instruct my people to offer no resistance when Lucknow is entered... by the Company's troops.<eos> Where is your mosque?<eos> I can see it clearly in my mind's eye.
We're gonna spin some music while we wait for our next caller.<eos> Before you do that, I know a lot of kids would enjoy coming to the games to see a great veteran like Reggie skate.<eos> While we wait for our next caller, we'd like to remind you folks calling in to keep your questions within the boundaries of good taste.<eos> What kind of broad is it that calls up and says something like that?<eos> - They're supposed to be our fans.<eos> - Who cares? It's over.<eos> Idiot McGrath and his shitty PR schemes.<eos> I hate that cheap little bastard.<eos> What are these poor fuckers gonna do when they close the mill?<eos> They ain't closing it, just jacking the guys around so they'll feel happy they got jobs.
How will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?<eos> The regional governors now have direct control over their territories.<eos> Fear will keep the local systems in line.<eos> Fear of this battle station.<eos> And what of the rebellion?<eos> If the rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station... it is possible, however unlikely... that they might find a weakness and exploit it.<eos> The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.<eos> Any attack by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture... no matter what technical data they've obtained.<eos> This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.<eos> I suggest we use it.
I suppose the little fellow's got a touch of woodworm, what?<eos> - Say that again!<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - Say that again!<eos> - She was dead!<eos> Her skin was dry like old leaves.<eos> It was something the machine did to her.<eos> Like old leaves?<eos> Sounds like organic distillation - the life essence.<eos> That's what he called it.
- He was very convincing.<eos> He was coached and we can guess who coached him.<eos> He still thinks this is Poldark land.<eos> Well... he'll have to be taught that it is not.<eos> Elizabeth, it would give me great joy if you were to show the world where you stand in this.<eos> This is my land and part of the inheritance of our son.<eos> You are a joint trustee.<eos> I want you to sign the order of eviction against these people, it would show them just how much they were mistaken.<eos> George never surprises me.<eos> Think of a mean thing and he does it.
But you must try to talk to him, I get the impression he feels lonely.<eos> It's as though our harmony is a plot against him.<eos> Let's not talk about it, shall we go out?<eos> I'd love to but Grazia has invited me to a party at villa Lodovici.<eos> They invited you?<eos> I'm glad.<eos> I can cancel.<eos> - No, it pleases me.<eos> I knew her father, he amassed a great fortune...<eos> And he deserves it.
It was sort of blackmail<eos> I told the police what she said she would do but... they couldn't care less<eos> She was still warm<eos> She's dead<eos> Didn't she understand...?<eos> There is only life<eos> Death doesn't exist<eos> Kamikaze, have you got a lodger?<eos> There used to be an ink you could erase old writing with and write something new at the same time<eos> I keep thinking the same thing, and writing it down even when I keep waking from my dream
No regrets! No fear!<eos> All we have to fear is ourselves. Should I fold it a little?<eos> You'll look more elegant.<eos> I don't want to be elegant.<eos> I want to be strong! It's not only a shirt!<eos> It's a symbol!<eos> You're actually sewing a flag! Am I wrong, Baroni?<eos> More macho?<eos> Good, not better looking, but more macho!<eos> You'll have a black shirt too, and you'll wear it till you die!
Shitty fatty!<eos> Fascist cow!<eos> Fascist cow!<eos> Away, women!<eos> Let's take them to the pigsty!<eos> No trespassing, you cannot pass!<eos> - Let us pass!<eos> - We want to be there too!<eos> Leave them to us!<eos> Comrades, is it true that you're giving the land to those who work it?

Hunt worked for Colson at the White House.<eos> Hunt was investigating Kennedy at Chappaquiddick.<eos> That should tell you a lot.<eos> What else?<eos> We're beginning to hear a lot about a lawyer at CREEP named Gordon Liddy... who's...<eos> Gordon Liddy... was fired by Mitchell because he wouldn't talk to the FBI.<eos> - You'll hear more.<eos> - Will he talk?<eos> I was at a party once, and...<eos> Liddy put his hand over a candle, and he kept it there.

Breakfast followed by lunch.<eos> Okay. Metro?<eos> Well, we got the schoolteachers on Capitol Hill.<eos> They want a 17% increase in pay or this fall they go on strike.<eos> Harry, I think we could mention that this might be the time... to go to the front page on the district home rule.<eos> - Oh, come on!<eos> - Listen to him.<eos> Ben, this time it could go all the way.<eos> The House is going to vote next week on a Senate resolution.<eos> Okay then, well, when they pass it, we'll run with it.
Most of all I'd like you to give me a double dose of those sleeping pills.<eos> - Maybe I'll sleep twice as well.<eos> - And then?<eos> Then I'd like to sleep here in your bed, without making love.<eos> You'd hold my hand if needed...<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Don't drink if you'll take the sleeping pills.<eos> 0,5 mg Valium and two Mogadons.<eos> A good combination.<eos> I use it myself without after- effects.
- How do you do, sir? Dr. Perry was kind enough to nominate me as his worst student.<eos> It took me longer to graduate from geological engineering than any other man alive.<eos> Oh, but you had many fine qualities, David. But you were rather slow.<eos> And that is rather surprising because his father was so clever.<eos> One of the best we ever had in, uh, '58, I think it was.<eos> Yes, yes, '58. Dear old dad.<eos> He should've been here to see the mole.<eos> Ah, that is what you call it?<eos> The... the "iron mole"?<eos> That's what I call it. Dr. Perry here, calls it a high calibration digging machine.
The prince highly respects me.<eos> I have a letter from his excellency Cardinal Lowrier.<eos> He kindly accepted to recommend me to you.<eos> I would like to submit to the attention of your...<eos> In my country, turtles are a sign of good luck, Highness.<eos> Here are the designs for a new type of fortress based on three principles of Democritus and Leucippus.<eos> I know that your war at the borders...<eos> Observe these seeds, Highness.<eos> They produce a repulsive red efflurescence, but it has miraculous virtues.<eos> It was discovered by a Spanish monk who experimented it many times on himself.
"...even today he is not ashamed to admit...<eos> "that he went down on his knees, overwhelmed by frenzied enthusiasm...<eos> "to thank heaven with an overbrimming heart...<eos> "for granting him the fortune to live in this age..."<eos> Bring me my chocolates!<eos> Sit down!<eos> Tell me, Gabriel.<eos> Would you want to sleep with a cripple?<eos> You don't have to say anything. I know the answer.<eos> I tell it to myself almost every day.
- Here's the payment for 48.<eos> - See you.<eos> We're friends aren't we?<eos> The one time I ask you for something!<eos> - The jacket isn't your size.<eos> - Oh really?<eos> I saw the boy who came into the shop.<eos> He was exactly the same size.<eos> - I'm not lying to you.<eos> - Let me try it on and then we'll see.
When did you begin to question Last Day?<eos> I didn't say I questioned it.<eos> Well, do you?<eos> WOMAN [OVER MONITOR]:<eos> Entering a reservation for violent delinquents.<eos> Authorized persons only.<eos> I've never been in this quadrant before.<eos> Request door open, Cathedral Plaza.<eos> WOMAN [OVER RADIO]: Logan 5 authorized to enter risk area.<eos> They shut it to keep in the cubs.
- What do you mean?<eos> I'm supposed to be the best in my business.<eos> I'm the best because people think I am the best.<eos> I'm past it.<eos> I know it.<eos> Soon it'll become common knowledge.<eos> Boy, something has gotten you.<eos> Babe...<eos> I bet you still have that goddamn gun.<eos> Why do you keep it?
- Can you handle it?<eos> - I'll do what you say.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Who gave you this news?<eos> A friend of that woman who was killed, Violet.<eos> He also wants revenge, but he's afraid of them.<eos> That's why he wanted you to have this information.<eos> A villa?<eos> Of course I know about this villa!<eos> I'm taking your car, you'll get it back with interest.
They hung him up on a cottonwood, though, and he sort of...<eos> He sort of what?<eos> Sort of strangled for a while.<eos> Braxton was there dressed in a suit.<eos> - Lookin' like God.<eos> Goddamn.<eos> I'll tell you, the first time I met Sandy... Listen at this, now.<eos> The first time I met Sandy, he was rustling on his own.<eos> He had a stolen cavalry pony and he kept this dog.<eos> As soon as he killed a steer, he'd cut the brand off and feed it to the dog.
Isn't this fun?<eos> OK now, graymeat... what you thought you was gonna get... you could get from anybody crazy enough... to fool with your worthless behind. But I'm giving you something you can't find... nowhere else.<eos> Now where'd you get these things from? The mail order house?<eos> Who's been taking care of this skin of yours, child?<eos> No color.<eos> You know, I was an acrobat when I was a little girl. I got real good.<eos> Mama finally took me into town and gave me lessons.<eos> So I'll tell you something. It hasn't hurt me much in my professional life. There.<eos> Now see, we can do this here all night... right on up until he pass out in there.<eos> I'm gonna throw 300 pounds of iron... through that door if you don't open it up. Hold it.
There are too many tourists here.<eos> Where are you going then?<eos> The island ofAlmandora.<eos> Where?<eos> The island ofAlmandora.<eos> Oh, you mean Almanzora.<eos> Oh, it's pronounced Almanzora?<eos> We are right here....in Benavis.<eos> Almanzora is right around here.<eos> If you're looking for peace and quiet, you'll find it onAlmanzora.
Hello?<eos> Hi, how are you?<eos> I wanted to do a theater piece that's a bit experimental and I thought of you... This is Alberto Moravia.<eos> Did you get the tickets?<eos> A great show.<eos> Frankfurt against Benfica.<eos> The flag?<eos> No, I don't carry the flag anymore.<eos> They've already beat me up 3 times.<eos> Have Arbasino carry it, he's even got a banner.
He would have to leave the Ark, where it comes from.<eos> Maybe it was the only one who was brought on board!<eos> - Dance, Miss Halse?<eos> - Oh, with enthusiasm, Mr. Wentworth.<eos> It 'a product of the Americas.<eos> White, plump and succulent.<eos> Dara 'off handsomely, with a little' encouragement.<eos> - Dr Halse!<eos> - The potato, my dear!<eos> Once you try it, you do not stop eating it.
There's a goat and a wolf.<eos> The wolf looks at the goat and wants to eat it.<eos> You know what is a wolf? .<eos> He wants to eat the goat.<eos> I take my gun, aim at the wolf, kill him and save the goat.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> It's immoral for the wolf to eat the goat.<eos> It's man who eats the goat.<eos> I killed the wolf and saved the goat.<eos> Then we caught the goat, killed and roasted it, we had a feast.
- Lord Melbury.<eos> May I introduce my wife?<eos> - Yes, we have met.<eos> - My wife, may I introduce His Lordship?<eos> - Thank you, Basil, we've sorted it out.<eos> Splendid, splendid.<eos> I wonder, could I deposit this case with you?<eos> It's just a few valuables.<eos> Valuables, of course.<eos> Please let me take it now.

- Oh, in the bag.<eos> Let me do it.<eos> You just lie there with your feet up and I'll carry you up another hundredweight of lime creams.<eos> I am actually about to undergo an operation, Basil.<eos> Oh, yes, how is the old toenail?<eos> Still growing in, still burrowing its way down to the bone, still macheteing its way through the nerve?<eos> Nasty old nail.<eos> It's still hurting, if that's what you mean, Basil.<eos> It'll be out in the morning, poor little devil.<eos> I wonder if they'd mount it for me, just for old times' sake.
I have not been given the chance.<eos> Oh, come on now.<eos> This is quite absurd.<eos> I'm sorry, I do not want the omelette.<eos> - It's nice.<eos> - I don't want the bloody thing.<eos> I've sent it back once. Give it to me.<eos> I fail to see how this sort of thing could happen.<eos> I've torn it up.<eos> You'll never see it again.
Bad, bad Zoot!<eos> -What is it?<eos> -Wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!<eos> She has been setting light to our beacon, which is Grail-shaped.<eos> It's not the first time we've had this problem.<eos> It's not the real Grail?<eos> Wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot.<eos> She is a bad person, and must pay the penalty.<eos> Do you think this scene should have been cut?<eos> We were so worried when the boys were writing it.
Please sit down. Good morning, Mr. Procurator.<eos> It's obvious, in your case it was purely an accident.<eos> Unfortunately, not all young people, after taking the first step, are sensible to find the courage to give up repeating this experience.<eos> Your case has not yet been shelved, but I hope it soon will.<eos> - Now it seems you truly regret what you did, you've realized you made a mistake.<eos> - Can I rely on you, Mr. Procurator?<eos> - Of course, you are from a good family.<eos> A cigarette will do you no harm, as long as you promise you won't do it again.<eos> - DOES MATTEO SUSPECT ME? - I promise you, Mr. Procurator.<eos> That experience upset me so much, I wouldn't repeat it for anything in the world.
You are happy, then in bondage?<eos> Ever since I was a little girl, I have always been in bondage.<eos> The owner of the farm where I lived had seduced me when I was 12.<eos> By the time I was 17, I had become a regular whore.<eos> Afraid of him, and yet fascinated by him...<eos> He was cruel, and yet powerful.<eos> I laid with him every night, half willingly, half reluctantly.<eos> He both fascinated and repulsed me.<eos> I often think of that day years ago when my father had gone to town something happened that changed my feelings entirely.<eos> I lost my turtle in the tall grass and was looking for it...
- No.<eos> The lady jumps in the ditch with...<eos> - Look!<eos> Okay, I'm going to write it down. Dictate it!<eos> But are you crazy to write down the password?<eos> - What are they doing?<eos> - Next time I'm going!<eos> No, we'll toss.<eos> - I feel better now.<eos> - But what if they catch you and find it out?
I feel tired tonight, and I have an important appointment.<eos> - Would you go there?<eos> - Where?<eos> To Necchi's bar.<eos> We always meet there.<eos> - What should I do?<eos> - My friends will tell you all.<eos> Oh, this is important because it's a mixture of ox's blood and tomato sauce that can be sprayed on someone's face to make them look wounded.<eos> Another important thing:<eos> ...take the stocking and put it on your face.
I can type.<eos> There, you see.<eos> And as long as you keep taking the pills...<eos> Come for a visit, when you have time.<eos> I'll try.<eos> You know how it is. The kids.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Karli, what a surprise!<eos> The front door was open, so I thought...<eos> Bibi leaves it open when she goes shopping for me.
Mighty death.<eos> - Magical death... threatening my life.<eos> - How could my love die...<eos> How could the endlessly living perish?<eos> Yearning eternal blindness, where forever love and rapture await.<eos> Heart on heart.<eos> Mouth on mouth.<eos> All is illusion.<eos> Set us free of this world.<eos> Our hearts wonder wish, As full death, men named it evermore, beautiful delusion.
I can't wait to see it.<eos> Show me.<eos> How interesting!<eos> Becoming respectable in your old age?<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Hello there!<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Looks good.<eos> I feel peculiar in this purple shirt.<eos> You can take it off again.
No, I never had any words with Mr. Beale at all.<eos> I came down here to live in this -- in this house because I did all my singing here.<eos> I was so happy. I was happier going out and singing... than anything I've ever done since I was born.<eos> I liked it better than anything I ever did.<eos> - l can't find it, Mother.<eos> - Well, you could let me help you.<eos> - Let me --<eos> - Listen, kid. I'm extremely organized.<eos> I know exactly where to look for this stuff.<eos> I've got it under control right here, but I can't find it.
This stuff cost a lot of money.<eos> - I paid for this mostly myself, actually.<eos> - You're kidding.<eos> - You rich? - Yeah.<eos> How much?<eos> Personally or the whole family?<eos> Doesn't make any sense.<eos> They pay a guy like you to watch sharks?<eos> It doesn't make sense for a guy who hates the water to live on an island, either.<eos> It's only an island if you look at it from the water.
Sikander.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Alexander.<eos> He builded great city...<eos> Sikandergul, high in mountains.<eos> Sit on throne, all peoples worship him.<eos> Then one day, time comes, he say he must go to east.<eos> People pull their hairs out, tear clothes... so Sikander promise to send back son.<eos> 328 B.C... the encyclopedia said.<eos> Soldiers saw arrow go into Danny's chest... him pluck it out and not bleeding.
Hit me, Chief.<eos> L got the moves.<eos> I got them, Chief.<eos> Hold it right there.<eos> Give me the ball.<eos> Give me the ball.<eos> That's it.<eos> Thank you, Chief.<eos> Now, hold it right there.<eos> Now, you take the ball, you jump up and put it in the basket.
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of taking something if I don't know what it is.<eos> - Don't get upset, Mr. McMurphy.<eos> - L'm not getting upset, Miss Pilbow.<eos> It's just that I don't want anyone to try and slip me saltpeter.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> It's all right, Nurse Pilbow.<eos> If Mr. McMurphy doesn't want to take his medication orally I'm sure we can arrange that he can have it some other way.<eos> But I don't think you'd like it, Mr. McMurphy.<eos> You'd like it, wouldn't you, Hard-on?<eos> Give it to me.
I can't. L just can't.<eos> It's easier than you think, Chief.<eos> For you, maybe.<eos> You're a lot bigger than me.<eos> Why, Chief, you're about as big as a goddamn tree trunk.<eos> My papa's real big.<eos> He did like he pleased.<eos> That's why everybody worked on him.<eos> The last time I seen my father he was blind in the cedars from drinking.<eos> And every time he put the bottle to his mouth he don't suck out of it. It sucks out of him until he'd shrunk so wrinkled and yellow, even the dogs don't know him.
It doesn't make sense.<eos> Sense?<eos> You little ignoramus!<eos> Evidently you don't know that Mrs Felicia Heymans is considered one of the finest of our English poets.<eos> I know another piece of poetry by heart.<eos> It has ever so many verses, much more than 'The Wreck of the Hesperus'.<eos> Would that do?<eos> What is the name of this poem?<eos> 'An Ode to St Valentine'.<eos> I'm not acquainted with it.
Shit.<eos> Bitch.<eos> All right!<eos> I don't care!<eos> Water.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Come in.<eos> Monsieur, your drink.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Put it on the table.
And you did frighten me. Once again, Mrs Eberhart, my apologies.<eos> But this is a pretty quiet town.<eos> Lot of very nice houses, like your own.<eos> People have valuable things.<eos> We have to be careful.<eos> You see that old mansion over there?<eos> - It's a landmark building.<eos> - I didn't know that.<eos> Some railroad tycoon built it in 1870.<eos> Before the Men's Association took it over, it was a wreck.
The blow on that Sunday in December, took us by surprise.<eos> Many had brought their children.<eos> The masses filled the squares.<eos> It was indescribable! They were on the roof of the King George Hotel, and on the pediments of the royal palace.<eos> We could see the barrels of their guns all around us.<eos> We were surrounded by police.<eos> The crowd was shouting.<eos> Suddenly we heard shots!<eos> I was in the middle of the square. Someone was hit near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.<eos> The people dipped a flag in his blood and raised it high up and began shouting:
Good day, sirs, to you both.<eos> I look forward to our next meeting.<eos> Well?<eos> There's a good, rich vein of copper there.<eos> It would take a lot of money to get it out but we could work it ourselves - with Ross.<eos> I'm not anxious to make an enemy of Warleggan for life.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> I fell into the water.<eos> - It was rather deep.<eos> - Yes. If there's deep water to be found, you'll find it.
I would like to convince Jinny to leave the mine.<eos> Not good even to her.<eos> You can not 'find a job elsewhere?<eos> You ', but they do not pay as much as mine.<eos> - The only way to take it away from them 'and' marry her. - 'Cause you do not?<eos> I can not even afford the rent of a house, sir ... Not until ... 'I'm not well enough to return to the mine.<eos> - Now back to the fields.<eos> - Jim ...<eos> There 'a little house empty Mellin,' as is' does not make me anything ...<eos> It needs some repair, but you can not rent it, if you put it in place.
Thanks for visiting, Sir Hugh.<eos> I'm sorry that my husband is not at home.<eos> But it really was you, lady, I wanted to see.<eos> One of my mares and 'crippled.<eos> John Trevaunance told me that you have taken care of his cow-tailed whip.<eos> I thought that you might come to me ...<eos> - ... And take a look at my beast.<eos> - Can you walk?<eos> In a sense.<eos> Then bring it here a few days and I'll give 'gladly look.
Right at the back-- that's justice.<eos> Oh, boy. What do you want?<eos> This your boy's head?<eos> No, no, we got his head!<eos> He ain't hurt that bad.<eos> Hey, that's jerry marinello.<eos> He fought the killer last week.<eos> Okay, give it to me.<eos> I'm seeing his trainer tomorrow.<eos> I'll give it to him.
There now follows a party political broadcast on behalf of the Liberal Party.<eos> ANNOUNCER [on radio]: Pratt, back to Pratt.<eos> Pratt again, a long ball out to Pratt.<eos> And now Pratt is on the ball, a neat little flick back inside to Pratt who takes it nicely, zips it through on the far side to Pratt.
- Maybe we could get away before Urko has guards posted everywhere.<eos> Look, Galen. You were right about us getting into trouble.<eos> And you're probably right that we should leave now.<eos> But you won't.<eos> - And you, Pete?<eos> - I know it sounds silly.<eos> It sounds so silly, I won't even say it.<eos> You know the answer.<eos> I know the answer.<eos> I knew it before I asked. I always do.
Her fever's down a little.<eos> When they wake up, we'll give them the second medication.<eos> We need time.<eos> Zaius gave me until noon.<eos> If he can control the situation...<eos> The gorillas are coming. They'll burn our houses, everything.<eos> - There goes the situation.<eos> - Urko acts independently of the council!<eos> I came here for a victory of my own.<eos> Urko will not take it away from me.
Another four years?<eos> Virdon says she'll be all right.<eos> He's turned your mind with clever talk and tricks.<eos> This cow is dying from their curse.<eos> She started dying the day they walked in here with that human-lover, Galen!<eos> I'll have a talk with them.<eos> Galen can stand.<eos> I've seen him.<eos> They're staying so the cow will die, I tell you.<eos> Humans burn the flesh and eat it.
We're a poor farm family.<eos> Would you deny us what little fun we can make for ourselves?<eos> Now, look.<eos> See?<eos> I make the family laugh.<eos> White.<eos> Like a human, see?<eos> And then I walk around like a straight-necked goose.<eos> Like a human, see?<eos> I'll have some meat and cook it good!
And he reached a big road. On the road there were many trucks.<eos> The boy waited on the roadside until a truck stopped. The driver asked him if he needed a ride.<eos> The boy was delighted. He was proud to sit next to the driver, who let him turn the dial on the radio.<eos> And the boy drove with him until they reached the sea. And at the sea he remembered his mother.<eos> I don't like my cornflakes like this.<eos> They're already soggy.<eos> I want to pour on the milk myself.<eos> Bring her another bowl. And tea for me.<eos> I've rented a car. We'll drive down all the streets. Then we'll surely find the house.<eos> When I see it, I'll recognize it.
In its very style, the exposition of dialectical theory is a scandal... and an abomination according to the rules of the dominant language, and for the taste they have educated because in the... positive use of existing concepts, it includes both the intelligence... of their rediscovered fluidity, and their necessary destruction.<eos> The style which contains its own critique... should express the domination of present critique... over its entire past.<eos> Through it, the mode of exposition of dialectical theory... attests to the negative spirit which is in it.<eos> "Truth is not like the product in which the trace of the tool... can no longer be found."<eos> This theoretical consciousness of movement, in which the very trace of movement should be present, manifests itself by the overturning of established.. relations between concepts, and by the detournement of all the acquisitions of previous critique.<eos> Ideas improve.<eos> The meaning of words participates in this.<eos> Plagiarism is necessary.<eos> Progress implies it.<eos> It clings to an author's phrase, makes use of his expressions, erases a false idea, replaces it with the right idea.
- You think they're the same?<eos> - You mean, they're not?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That was a while ago.<eos> I have an idea, fella.<eos> I've been getting one myself.<eos> - An idea?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What's yours?<eos> - I have to show it to you.
- For God's sake, we'll get there.<eos> - You never ask me what I want to do.<eos> - Sure I do.<eos> We're in this together.<eos> - When you say so.<eos> Who the hell do you think you are, buddy?<eos> I said we'll get there.<eos> If you can find a job, if it pays more than $50 a week... and if you don't get involved with another maniac.<eos> Who cares? I don't give a damn.<eos> If you open your mouth once more... I swear to God, I'm going to nail it shut.
...now available. Here's the new LT 500.<eos> If you're in surveillance, you belong into the LT 500.<eos> You can hear your sounds here and know exactly which door has been violated. I see.<eos> And you got your local alarms on the doors, which I'm sure you've heard. It's quite noisy.<eos> It has a Super 8mm camera in here, and the dot right here, the 10:00 dot, will show exactly what the camera sees on the back.<eos> It's a magazine-loaded camera,<eos> Super 8mm...<eos> William P. Moran of Detroit, Michigan, house courtesy telephone, please.<eos> That's your automatic recorder actuator.<eos> It undetectably starts the recorder when the phone is lifted and shuts it off when the receiver is put back.
Let me know when I can see the rest.<eos> It was good!<eos> - Are you leaving now?<eos> - I'll call you.<eos> See you soon!<eos> I need to ask you about the eighth reel, the sequence with the mother.<eos> We'll look at it later.<eos> At every level, I feel I'm blocked.<eos> By taking my childhood as the subject for this film...<eos> I get the feeling I'm exploiting it.
It doesn't make a difference whether it's two or three people.<eos> Where would we go?<eos> To a really good place.<eos> With a big sunny house, a garden full of flowers,<eos> the sound of piano playing, with the merriment of a nursery, and a nice big bath!<eos> No one will trouble us there!<eos> Why don't you run and get us... a bottle of sake?<eos> - Sake?<eos> - Yes, sake!<eos> We'll drink it and then we can go.
But how can we avoid lying?<eos> Sit down here.<eos> All my life, I've felt you close to me.<eos> Your perfume, your presence.<eos> The times I held you on my lap when you were a child.<eos> When I think of a woman, it's always you I see.<eos> Of all my nephews, I've always loved you the best.<eos> Remember that Holy Thursday, sitting side by side in the church's dim light?<eos> Your hand was resting on the pew.<eos> Gently, I put my hand on yours and squeezed it.
Children, have you seen Zumurrud pass this way?<eos> Who is this Zumurrud?<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> We'll just give you a nice massage!<eos> Lie down here.<eos> - Stop, you're making him rise!<eos> You're trying to take all his goodness!<eos> Part of it is mine, isn't it?<eos> No, I made it stand, and as my mother used to say:<eos> "Whoever brings barren earth to life, owns it and enjoys it."

I'll do it.<eos> Nick.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> I waited till about four o'clock.<eos> She came to the window.<eos> She stood a minute and then turned out the light.<eos> Have you got a cigarette?<eos> Just one.<eos> We'll share it.<eos> Imagine what this island looked like when those Dutch sailors first saw it.
Isn't it good that we know?<eos> Sure.<eos> Today you know it. Tomorrow the neighbors... Soon it will be the talk of the ghetto.<eos> Then the Gestapo will hear about it.<eos> They don't need us to find the Russians.<eos> Of course not.<eos> But the damned Gestapo will know there's a radio here.<eos> They'll turn the area upside down until they find the radio.<eos> They won't rest until they have it.<eos> Where will they find it?
If I surrender, it will be to you.<eos> You alone.<eos> Do you not want that?<eos> what do you want me to say?<eos> Only the "yes" that I see already on your lips.<eos> Since you see it, it must be there.<eos> You can do with me as you wish.<eos> - what are you looking up at?<eos> - The moon.<eos> Carmaduc says that little cloud is engulfing the moon, drowning it.

I came of my own accord.<eos> I am deeply honoured but I think things are best left as they are.<eos> what do you want?<eos> Your friendship in exchange for mine.<eos> we both serve the same king.<eos> He takes your advice. He does not take mine.<eos> we are equal.<eos> Our table was made round so there would be no precedence.<eos> A woman's scarf?<eos> Do you recognise it?

This sheep isn't so small.<eos> Alas, I couldn't argue with him.<eos> I'd grown too old to see sheep through the walls of boxes.<eos> Is Paris on this planet?<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Did you forget?<eos> No, I didn't forget.<eos> But why did you ask?<eos> - Arert you from this planet?<eos> - The thing that's so good about this box is, at night, he can use it as his house.
- 3 by 3, is it?<eos> 9 sqm.<eos> It's no good really, is it?<eos> How do you imagine living here?<eos> We'll have some furniture.<eos> I've got some furniture of my own.<eos> - Is this meat hard, or is it just me?<eos> - It's good.<eos> Although, I'd prefer it fried rather than stewed.<eos> You can fry it yourself.
" Who will be rewarded properly for their actions? "<eos> And Jesus called a little child, and said to him:<eos> ... "Who comes into the kingdom of heaven"<eos> "Gonna go to hell, who enriched themselves by stealing from the poor...<eos> "... prodajuæi rich. "<eos> - Someone, whose name I do not want to mention.<eos> - What to Gonzaga?<eos> - Do not say that!<eos> Why not take off his robe and repeat what you said?<eos> I'm not going to take it off.
Just keep them in a safe place for me<eos> Make the best deal you can for us both<eos> Let's see the merchandise<eos> No doubt their origin... is a secret?<eos> Maximum discretion, yes!<eos> A royal Oriental family...<eos> They don't want any publicity<eos> The Rosenkrantz necklace!<eos> It vanished when the seals were removed...<eos> The heirs are searching for it
They got what they want!<eos> Wait a minute! Wait a minute!<eos> Can't anybody count?<eos> They all four got off!<eos> There's nobody driving' the fuckin' train!<eos> Anybody in there? !<eos> All right, all clear.<eos> All right, then.<eos> You know the drill.<eos> We do it by the numbers.
Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Howdy, Bowie.<eos> What you boys doing out here, fishing?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey, did y'all hear the one about the little boy that bought the turtle?<eos> Had one of them turtles, you know, that they paint pictures on.<eos> Well, the next day, he took it down to the store, and he grabbed the manager and he says, "Look," he says,<eos> "My turtle got blisters on his feet."<eos> Man looked at him and says, "That's not possible, son." He reached down, he took the turtle away from him, he looked at it.

He reached down, he took the turtle away from him, he looked at it.<eos> He says, "Son, I believe you're right."<eos> He says, "This turtle does have blisters on his feet."<eos> Had two syrup buckets sitting over there on the counter.<eos> He reached over there and he dropped that turtle in one syrup bucket, and he reached down in that other syrup bucket and pulled out that turtle, and he handed it to the little boy.<eos> Little boy took that turtle, and he looked at it and he said, "Thank you, sir."<eos> He put it right on top of the counter and he says... God almighty, man.
Pretty good.<eos> The American School of the Air takes pleasure in presenting the most celebrated love story of all literature. The tragedy ofRomeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare... My nose hasn't bled in a couple of days.<eos> How's your ribs?<eos> Not too good.<eos> In this special radio adaptation ofRomeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare, The American School of the Air presents...<eos> I hope you get a good night's sleep tonight.<eos> ... some of the most beautiful lines of... I don't see how I can miss now you gave me this quilt.<eos> It's real warm.<eos> Yeah, I love it, too.<eos> My great-grandmother made it 62 years ago.
Jean-Claude...<eos> -Listen closely. -I'm listening.<eos> Listen closely.<eos> The guy seemed nuts about his car.<eos> So we'll return it.<eos> We'll leave it by the side of the road.<eos> -Follow me?<eos> -Yeah...<eos> Now for the good part.<eos> The cops find the car, the pimp picks it up at the station.
Rotten.<eos> Lxnay on the ottenray.<eos> I'm not afraid.<eos> I know what he likes.<eos> That music.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's in your blood.<eos> It's in the blood of all Frankensteins.<eos> It reaches the soul when words are useless.<eos> Your grandfather used to play it to the creature he was making.
- What happened?<eos> - He took the robot and left<eos> This must be the place<eos> A truck's come for the robot<eos> - I guess the Police Chief lt'll be the doctor's men<eos> They don't know he's left<eos> They'll deliver the box to him<eos> - And of course, I'll be inside<eos> - Are you crazy, Tekin?<eos> What if the doctor opens it?
It's just a fraudulent program to trick the voters.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Mr. Sato is a respectable politician who understands the needs of the people.<eos> You're a lesbian, aren't you?<eos> What did you say?<eos> You can't fool me.<eos> Every gangster girl in Osaka calls me Sappho on the street.<eos> Shut your mouth!<eos> This shower is for exclusive use of committee members.<eos> Next time you use it, you'll be punished.
My mother died of pneumonia when I was just a kid.<eos> My father'd kept their wedding cake frozen for 10 whole years.<eos> After the funeral he gave it to the yardman.
Well, he was sick.<eos> You couldn't do much about that.<eos> - I guess not.<eos> - So?<eos> - Well, it scared me.<eos> - I know...<eos> I didn 't mind telling Kit about this stuff.<eos> Strange things happened to him too.<eos> And some of what he did was strange.<eos> He faked his signature whenever he used it to keep other people from forging important papers with his name.
River must've washed the roots away.<eos> You don't care about anything I say, though.<eos> - You know what I think?<eos> - What?<eos> Let's crunch our hands with this stone.<eos> Then we won't forget today.<eos> - But it would hurt.<eos> - Well, that's the point, stupid.<eos> Don't call me stupid.<eos> Okay, but I'm gonna keep it for a souvenir.
And if we never got back, somebody might dig them up years later and they'd wonder.<eos> We should have hopped it.<eos> It was going too fast.<eos> I could have pulled the car on the tracks to slow it down.<eos> Then we'd be stuck here.<eos> Maybe we ought to be stuck here.<eos> I'm not saying I know.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> Kit spun the bottle, leaving to fate which direction we should take.<eos> The slope throws it off, we ought to find a flat place.
Exotic, you know?<eos> I mean, you tell him you are the queen of the giant Kluck-luks from Inner Siberia and he starts dripping in his pants, and the only way he's gonna get it off is to have you crawl around the floor, talk bad to you, spit on you, things like that.<eos> Where does King George find girls that'll do that kind of an act?<eos> Through his pushers. They find strung-out chicks that do anything to get straight.<eos> He has got people all over.<eos> Now, one more thing.<eos> - Where does he keep his supply?<eos> - His sup...<eos> Hey, what are you trying, to get me killed?<eos> Where does he keep it?
- Why?<eos> I do what my grandfather told me.<eos> If you're not sure about a mushroom, don't pick it.<eos> Because if it is bad and you pick and eat it, it's your last mushroom, it's the end.<eos> - Understand?<eos> - I do.<eos> Grandfather wasrt crazy about eating them. What he liked was looking for them, even if he had to walk all day.<eos> He never got tired.<eos> See that mountain?<eos> He called it the mushroom garden.
How do I get the dog to come with me?<eos> He has to open a door. - Is it locked?<eos> It's closed off.<eos> With paper.<eos> Just call him.<eos> He's well-trained.<eos> So how do I get him to come with me?<eos> - Just say "heel"!<eos> With conviction.<eos> When you get to the door, you say "Hop"! And he'll open it.
That's enough, Ugo.<eos> Stop.<eos> They must think I've abandoned them.<eos> Here we are... together, happy.<eos> And they--<eos> Wait here, Philippe.<eos> I'll see who it is.<eos> Straight ahead.<eos> There's someone in the house.<eos> - The meat- - Where do we put it?
Happiness?<eos> Happiness is...<eos> End barbarous heres y!<eos> Viv a the Western Christian world !<eos> Viv a Spain !<eos> Fire !<eos> Are you looking at my nail?<eos> Why is it so long?<eos> I cut it only once a y ear, in the autumn.<eos> I wrap it in a little leaf. I keep it in a sack.
Kit Lambert, our manager... had just signed Jimi Hendrix to our label... and put him on... backing us up.<eos> And I couldn't really believe it.<eos> I thought, "Jesus Christ, what's gonna happen?"<eos> So he went on and he did his thing.<eos> He knocked the amplifiers over.<eos> He set his guitar alight.<eos> He practically smashed it up.
I'll teach you to foolin' around with my friends!<eos> Stop it!<eos> No!<eos> Looking for a good time, girlie?<eos> /Police search for missing gunman<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi there.<eos> A one-way ticket for the Northpark-Lonsdale bus.<eos> We don't sell 'em for that one.<eos> I don't know nothing about it.
What'd they pick you up for?<eos> I heard they were springing you.<eos> Got a way to get home?<eos> No.<eos> These mothers bring you here but they don't care about how you get back.<eos> I'll give you a lift home.<eos> There's a few back issues you might be interested in.<eos> Blew his brains out in a little godforsaken town in Mexico.<eos> - He left a full confession. - I'm reading it.<eos> Don't describe it to me too.
[I non cee, holla?<eos> ] I am from a nearby Lamasery.<eos> My name is Chang.<eos> Mine is Richard Conway.<eos> How do you do?<eos> How you do.<eos> Forgive me, I hadn't expected anybody in this part of the world to talk English.<eos> I was an undergraduate at Oxford in my young days.<eos> It was there that I had the opportunity of improving my knowledge of your language.<eos> You speak it very well.
Well, almost born here.<eos> It was just beyond the pass.<eos> My parents were explorers who couldn't rest until they had seen everything.<eos> Unfortunately, they died just on the other side.<eos> And Chang rescued you.<eos> Fateful Chang, he and his men found me barely alive.<eos> Here I've grown up and here I've been happy.<eos> With no desire to leave.<eos> Absolutely none.<eos> So I should know a good thing when I see it.
could do with a cold drink afterwards.<eos> It's high time they made a move on.<eos> In 1956, everything suddenly tumbled down.<eos> It hurt you a bit.<eos> You thought, what next?<eos> In 1956, I asked permission to move to production work.<eos> So, I went back to where I'd come from.<eos> Why can't people see that someone's doing a bad job, I don't know.<eos> Is this some sort of a method... or is it simply short-sightedness.<eos> only when a growth becomes malignant do they remove it.
Shooting a film is like crossing the Wild West by stagecoach.<eos> You set out hoping for a nice trip, but soon you wonder if you'll ever reach your destination.<eos> Sorry to bother you, sir. - I'm Lajoie, the new production manager.<eos> - Ah, of course!<eos> Regarding the car for Pamela's accident, you have your choice of these two.<eos> These two?<eos> The white one would work.<eos> Could we paint it blue?<eos> For 2,000 francs. Just to paint it blue?<eos> We'll use it as it is.
Sister Hallett, Room 9 for Mr. Travis and 36 for Mrs. Stewart.<eos> I'll want a complete analysis on Travis by this afternoon.<eos> Yes, professor.<eos> Hughes, Keating, please.<eos> Waterworks, okay?<eos> Yes, fine, thank you.<eos> No inherent madness in the family?<eos> No, none whatsoever.<eos> Where's she taking my suit?<eos> Don't worry, you'll find it in your wardrobe.
Mr. Hart?<eos> Mr. Bell, what do you think of Mr. O'Connor's argument?<eos> Mr. Bell?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> Do you find Mr. O'Connor's argument convincing?<eos> I don't find anything Mr. O'Connor says convincing.<eos> You know, it always amazes me... when law students have a hard time. I mean, people like Kevin.<eos> When you grow up with my father, you get immune... or insensitive to certain kinds of things.<eos> We used to own that house over there, too... but we sold it when my grandfather died.
Mexico won't be so bad for a few months.<eos> I guess that depends who you are.<eos> But if I was y'all I'd be clearing out of here.<eos> Gonna be some hard times coming down.<eos> Remember me to whoever rides by.<eos> Boy, get some water for these horses.<eos> - All right about the goddamn...<eos> - Hello there, Lemuel.<eos> Well, if it ain't the limb of the law, Patrick J. Garrett.<eos> Your booze is under the bar, where I always keep it.
- Tea, please.<eos> - What about your mail?<eos> - I'll send you my address.<eos> You can send the letters on, pay the bills in the usual way.<eos> The plumber was scheduled to come to fix the bathroom.<eos> Shall I call him?<eos> I figured it might have slipped your mind.<eos> I've phoned him dozens of times, I haven't forgotten it.<eos> What about your car?<eos> I've asked Paula's sister to take care of it.
He's your new partner.<eos> Hey look, if you don't want to work with this fucking nut for some reason, I'll buddy up with him, all right?<eos> And go through all that crap changing assignments?<eos> Nah, we'll be OK.<eos> We're Paisanos, right?<eos> - What's with the fuckin' mouse?<eos> - He's my partner.<eos> He's specially trained.<eos> He goes to track down heroin.<eos> Let him loose, he goes into the hole, picks it up, brings it back. Sniffs it out, brings it to you.
I'll make up what Don took from you.<eos> Why should I start now?<eos> Everybody would feel a lot better about you, Frank.<eos> You can always give it to charity.<eos> $100 a month, just for expenses?<eos> For my secretary and my business lunches, entertainment?<eos> All right. All right.<eos> We split Frank's share from now on.<eos> You're a schmuck, Frank.<eos> If they would take all that energy, put it into straight police work, we'd have the city cleaned up in a week.
Were you disappointed I wasn't a virgin?<eos> Hell no, baby.<eos> You had some good teachers.<eos> This is hardly the time to talk about it but I've made an important decision because of you.<eos> Well, my daddy told me, he said, "John...<eos> "... the one time you should never ever make an important decision...<eos> "... is right after you've made love. "<eos> It's about my clitoridectomy.<eos> That's an important decision, all right.<eos> When February comes, I'm not going to let them do it.
Checking the cell structure.<eos> - Ah, checking the cell structure.<eos> - Checking the cell structure.<eos> Structure of cells to be checked.<eos> - Checking the cell structure.<eos> - Checking the cells.<eos> Checking cell structure.<eos> Checking the cell structure.<eos> And now the cell structure has been checked.<eos> Now I'll just take my mask, if you don't mind, and I'll strap it on to my face.
I can't bear to wait.<eos> Keep turning.<eos> Keep turning.<eos> Mother, look at them.<eos> Listen to what Subol and Kishore did.<eos> As soon as I placed the leaf boat in the water, Subol and Kishore fought over it like kids.<eos> Each of them said they wanted it.<eos> And they wouldn't let go.<eos> I said "You've both made it.<eos> So why don't you share it?"
The following program is made possible by a grant from Eastman Kodak Company.<eos> Madame Bovary.<eos> Gustave Flaubert created her to demonstrate... the depth and cruelty of the gap between romantic illusion and everyday reality... and had her destroy herself... rather than live a life from which her dreams were banished.<eos> Vincente Minnelli brought her story to the screen... and framed it in the history of Flaubert's fight... against those who sought to censor his masterpiece.
- It's very simple.<eos> Let me show you.<eos> In the last century, the islanders were starving.<eos> Like our neighbours today, they were scratching a bare subsistence from sheep and sea.<eos> Then in 1868, my grandfather bought this barren island and began to change things.<eos> A distinguished Victorian scientist, agronomist, free thinker.<eos> How formidably benevolent he seems.<eos> Essentially the face of a man incredulous of all human good.<eos> You're very cynical, my lord.<eos> What attracted my grandfather to the island, apart from the profuse source of wiry labour that it promised, was the unique combination of volcanic soil and the warm Gulf Stream that surrounded it.
He's treating us to dinner.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - Hotel Blue Heaven..<eos> Do you know who's singing there?<eos> Sir, there's a call for you.<eos> Must be Sharma. Have to return his motorcycle.<eos> I'll just get back.<eos> Before I play the next number, I'll play an incomplete one.<eos> This song is 15 years old.<eos> Only 2 persons in this world can complete it.
Is pretty simple for us.<eos> If we have to build a house, so many bricks, so much time but up there, sweet Jesus, where do you put the foundations?<eos> They aren't just confetti, you know!<eos> Miranda.<eos> Are you asleep?<eos> Answer me!<eos> - Are you cold? Want my jacket?<eos> - What?<eos> - Go ahead, take it.<eos> - I don't want it.
Otherwise it swells up.<eos> I'm having trouble...<eos> It isn't easy.<eos> 43!<eos> I wouldn't have thought you had such a thick neck!<eos> Indeed, size 43 isn't very common.<eos> They want you...<eos> - Downstairs.<eos> - What about your bag?<eos> I can take it down.
Why haven't they called back?<eos> Where were you?<eos> I've been looking for you all day.<eos> When I'm here, Morell asks the same thing.<eos> I hope you don't make any mistakes with your answers.<eos> - So, what's going on?<eos> - The bubble's about to burst.<eos> Jameson here. The merchandise was collected this morning from New York customs.<eos> Naturally, there were no problems.<eos> Our agents are keeping an eye on it.
You feeling all right, old chap?<eos> Only during a period of social stability, can society adequately deal with criminals such as this man and this unfortunate girl.<eos> Doctor, listen! That sound!<eos> Silence, female!<eos> Quiet!<eos> It's the same noise that I heard on the cargo ship.<eos> Doctor, it's the Ogrons!<eos> Your Majesty, I beg of you to be cautious.<eos> Something is seriously wrong here.<eos> This ship that has just landed, I beg you, place it under guard immediately.
Do you read me?<eos> Do you read me?<eos> This is Earth police spaceship 2390, on a special mission to the President of Earth.<eos> Do you read me?<eos> Do you read me?<eos> Over. This is Earth police spaceship number 142, your ship is one that has been reported as stolen.<eos> You will please reduce speed, so that we can board you.<eos> Hello, Earth police spaceship 142.<eos> I think there'll in trouble over this.<eos> Hello, we've recaptured this ship and are taking it back to Earth.
Never mind.<eos> Once our plan succeeds, people will really begin to realise your true worth.<eos> Ah.<eos> Er, what are you doing?<eos> I've just been plotting the sightings of the three sinkings.<eos> There, there and there.<eos> And it's interesting that right in the middle of them, there's this abandoned sea fort.<eos> -Not abandoned any more, old chap.<eos> -Really?<eos> Hart's people are going to use it as a sonar testing station.
It's a gift.<eos> —A what?<eos> A gift.<eos> Oh, a gift!<eos> —Yes.<eos> A tax dodge.<eos> —No, no, no.<eos> Sorry, I don't understand.<eos> Can you just explain exactly what you want?<eos> I want you to give me a pound, and then I go away and give it to the orphans.
I clearly saw the defendant Doing whatever he's accused of Uh, red-handed.<eos> When kicked, uh, cautioned, he said...<eos> "it's a fair...<eos> cop, I done it all.<eos> Right. no... doubt about... that."<eos> Then, bound as he was to the chair He assaulted myself And three other constables<eos> While bouncing around the cell.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> And for my next piece of evidence...<eos> I-i think you'd better leave it there, constable.
We'll manage.<eos> You're just saying that.<eos> It's the truth, Hans.<eos> We'll manage. I know we will.<eos> If only I'd learned a decent trade, something solid.<eos> But as it is...<eos> Don't say that!<eos> It doesn't help.<eos> Listen, I'll find a regular pitch.<eos> All you need do is buy the fruit... and I'll sell it from the stall.
That is to say, with an oblong I will have made 3 or 4,000 circles or squares.<eos> Where is the crime in that?<eos> The love for others is a chimera that we owe to Christianity and not to Nature.<eos> The Nazarean is an unhappy fool, who in a moment of weakness, cried for tolerance towards humanity.<eos> He wanted to create that ridiculous rapport between one person and another.<eos> He hung onto his life by making us succeed in this.<eos> Nevertheless, you do not eternally retain your unfortunate victims.<eos> You release them from here, no doubt.<eos> Of course, Therese.<eos> You have only entered this house for a certain time before leaving it once again.
You'd forbid the rights which nature has accorded me over the other sex?<eos> No, Thérése.<eos> I shall treat my wife by rules that are laid down in every code in the universe, engraved in my heart. and sealed in nature.<eos> Oh Monsieur, your conversion is truly impossible?<eos> So, I would advise you not to make the attempt, Thérése.<eos> Are you sure, Thérése. That you wish to run this risk for my sake?<eos> There can be no other way at present, Madame.<eos> I have made every attempt to convert your fearsome husband.<eos> Oh no, give me the letter.<eos> I shall deliver it to your mother.
Let me park.<eos> - Hi. Are you OK?<eos> - Hello.<eos> Well?<eos> It will happen on the Paris to Lisbon train with a customs officer's help.<eos> - Day or night?<eos> - I don't know yet.<eos> When roughly?<eos> When they get the stuff they'll send it straight to Paris.<eos> Are you sure they'll use your guy to transport it?
I do baptize thee, now in the name of modern technology.<eos> How sweet, oh, yeah.<eos> Some idea.<eos> ED: Lewis?<eos> BOBBY: Does he think he is Tarzan or what?<eos> He knows the woods though, he really does.<eos> - He does.<eos> - Not really.<eos> He learned them, he doesn't feel them, that's Lewis' problem.<eos> He wants to be one with nature, and he can't hack it.
A police captain is on call 24 hours a day.<eos> He'll be there between 8 and 10.<eos> - Anybody know this joint?<eos> - Sure, I do.<eos> It's perfect for us.<eos> A small family place, good food.<eos> Everyone minds his business.<eos> Perfect.<eos> They've got an old-fashioned toilet. You know, the box and the chain thing.<eos> We might be able to tape the gun behind it.
I did not find, where you have placed?<eos> I lending.<eos> - When?<eos> - Yesterday.<eos> - To Vanina Abati, I guess.<eos> Like much of her?<eos> Yes<eos> - What happened between you and her?<eos> But nothing really?<eos> Left the school. I will not see it anymore.
lt`s not mine.<eos> They don`t need it anymore. The inquiry is over.<eos> Yes, she had some cuts here and on the neck.<eos> Excuse me. Where should I put it?<eos> - You could have rung.<eos> - lt was open. Here?<eos> No, in front of the fireplace.<eos> And these chairs?<eos> Here`s the table.<eos> Where do I put it?
But not through choice.<eos> Look, they were going to kill him.<eos> I know the Doctor would help you if he could.<eos> I am trying to help him!<eos> I've already save his life.<eos> Yes, for your own purposes.<eos> Look, if you do not tell me everything that manager knew about these criminals - where they operate from, what their plans are - then the Daleks will destroy both of you.<eos> I don't doubt it.<eos> Do you value life so little?<eos> On that contrary, I value it enormously.
Hiroshi.<eos> It's you.<eos> What on earth do you want?<eos> If we could reform the world into such a Utopia, we wouldn't need to strain.<eos> Simple reproduction might be a dream of mankind, but so long as the mode of reproduction on an enlarged scale is established, we can't remedy it.<eos> We'll be absorbed into it sooner or later.<eos> As its result, this valley, which you've cultivated with hard work, will be offered for sale as a resort property by a wicked tourist agent.<eos> I won't allow that.<eos> This is the ancestral seat, where I grew up.<eos> I'll never hand it over to anyone, no matter who it might be.
-Perrier<eos> St. Peter, good St. Peter.<eos> Thank you, St. Peter.<eos> Quickly.<eos> We have to get rid of the water.<eos> A bottle in the ocean.<eos> -Where?<eos> No, this bottle.<eos> Look.<eos> I'll throw it in with an SOS.
Know how many times we listened to that speech?<eos> Do you know how many times we've had to listen to that speech?<eos> Thinks we're as blind as him. Know what you are?<eos> You make me sick. If we thought like you...<eos> You know what I want?<eos> I want ideas.<eos> I want one idea.<eos> One idea could get us out of here!<eos> We'll have to be sure it's the right idea.<eos> We'll know it when we see it.
-He says he doesn't get any answer.<eos> -Pop. The log says they're in.<eos> -I don't get any answer.<eos> -Maybe they're on to it.<eos> -Don't panic.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hit it, Kid.<eos> Patrolman Claire!<eos> I borrowed this newspaper from the driver of Car George 3.<eos> Return it to him, and find out why he had it in his car.
Now lift the harness and slide him on the table.<eos> Don't be jealous about it.<eos> You're well-bosomed too.<eos> Sweet and ladylike.<eos> So round and perky.<eos> I hate you, Miss Martha!<eos> Another teaspoon of laudanum should put him to sleep.<eos> Give it to him.<eos> And now, Amy, you will go to your room... and you will not come out until you are told.<eos> And if I ever want your opinion, I'll ask for it!
If he lives and blames you for making him a cripple, what you gonna say?<eos> He would rather lose a leg than his life.<eos> Can you be sure he'd die if you don't?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> What if he dies as a result of the operation?<eos> My conscience would be clear.<eos> It wouldn't be if I let him die... and did nothing to try and save him.<eos> I suppose if we made the cut... above the popliteal division instead of below... we'd have fewer arteries to contend with.<eos> There's goin' to be bleeding no matter where you cut.<eos> We see a vessel bleeding, we tie it with thread.
Give your friend a hug!<eos> Bye, Bampo!<eos> My goodness!<eos> - What's the matter with this car?<eos> - Huh?<eos> It's weird, it never happened before!<eos> What can the problem be?<eos> - Throw it away!<eos> - No! What are you talking about?<eos> We could at least sell it!
It's Saturday!<eos> # Bye, bye, little girl.<eos> # Another kiss...<eos> Listen, dear fellow countrymen: we've always helped each other.<eos> I've made many sacrifices to buy this car!<eos> The engine is a jewel!<eos> It pulls like a rocket!<eos> We're stuck here if you don't buy it!<eos> I beg you - you can have it for just thirty dollars!<eos> Can't you realize that nobody wants it?
I've told you, Berta... When you're in need, I'm here.<eos> When you feel sad, you know, you can come to me.<eos> Who knows what is Bubù doing.<eos> He's waiting news from me for eight days.<eos> It's curious how you can find out the handicaps of others from a distance.<eos> But do you love him?<eos> He has beaten me so much that I don't know anymore.<eos> That's why you love him.<eos> Look at the old man.<eos> When he drinks beer, he throws it on himself.
New way?<eos> What's this about a new way?<eos> There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, I know it.<eos> If you must have it, have it, then.<eos> We go around shop crasting and the like...<eos> And Will the English in the coffee mesto saying he can fence anything any malchick tries to crast.<eos> The shiny stuff. The ice! The big, big money's available, is what Will the English says.<eos> And what will you do with the big, big, big money?<eos> Have you not everything you need?<eos> If you need a motorcar, you pluck it from the trees.
And it is during this period, we have found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience, environment and the violence he sees.<eos> Dr. Brodsky is pleased with you.<eos> You've made a very positive response.<eos> Tomorrow there will be two sessions, morning and afternoon.<eos> You mean I have to viddy two sessions in one day?<eos> I imagine you'll feel a bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.<eos> It was horrible.<eos> Of course it was horrible.<eos> Violence is a very horrible thing.<eos> That's what you're learning now. Your body's learning it.
And if you want to start something you just go ahead. Go on!<eos> I'm going to be sick.<eos> You're going to be sick, are you?<eos> I'm going to be sick. Please let me get up.<eos> You want to get up?<eos> Well, now you listen to me.<eos> If you want to get up you've got to do something for me.<eos> Here.<eos> You see that shoe?<eos> I want you to lick it.
But remember, without a corpus delicti, you can't prove a murder was committed.<eos> Why would a professional killer care?<eos> He's already on a plane back from where he came.<eos> I can't answer all your questions. I've given you a list of likely suspects.<eos> A clear motive. Isn't that enough to start with?<eos> That's plenty.<eos> And believe me, I'm very grateful for all the help you've given me.<eos> - Gee, that's funny.<eos> - What?<eos> This thing is folded lengthwise, like someone was carrying it in their pocket.
Do you think it was possible I wasn't ready?<eos> - What's this, a brush?<eos> - Have you spat on it?<eos> - No.<eos> - Spit!<eos> Spit!<eos> Well done!<eos> Saverio, what if your guitar gets here?<eos> Who the fuck carea about the guitar?<eos> If case be, you'll send it to me at home.
He got four and a half years. - No!<eos> And the lawyer?<eos> - He bungled everything! - Lh!<eos> O God!<eos> What about me?<eos> Superior!<eos> Superior!<eos> Is it true Saverio got four years?<eos> Ahh, what's this stench?<eos> Don't you recognize it?
Saverio says "take mine"...<eos> Percuoco says: "He's a phenomenon".<eos> Hell of a phenomenon.<eos> The judge aquits him, and what does the lawyer do?<eos> Get's him convicted?<eos> Then I must change my lawyer!<eos> Can I?<eos> - Make a request.<eos> - Alright!<eos> To whom must I make it, if I may?
As to humans, I've dissect... I've examined thousands of them, and, until now, I've only discovered two who could talk in my life.<eos> God knows who taught them.<eos> Where we come from, apes talk.<eos> Humans are dumb.<eos> - Where do you come from, Cornelius?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> Dr Milo was sure.<eos> Dr Milo was a genius well in advance of his time.<eos> When the spacecraft first landed on our seaboard, it was Dr Milo who salvaged it.<eos> He studied it and half understood it.
Other women enjoy complaining.<eos> Not Yente.<eos> Not every woman in the world is a Yente.<eos> Well, I have to go home now to prepare my poor Sabbath meal.<eos> So, goodbye, Golde.<eos> And it was a pleasure talking our hearts out to each other.<eos> You said you had news for me.<eos> I'm losing my head.<eos> Some day it will fall off altogether.<eos> And a horse will kick it in the mud and "Goodbye, Yente".
I know we are the chosen people.<eos> But once in a while, can't you choose someone else?<eos> Anyway, thank you for sending a husband for my Tzeitel.<eos> Lechaim.<eos> Now, after Jacob had worked for Laban for seven years, do you know what happened?<eos> Laban fooled him and gave him his ugly daughter Leah.<eos> So to marry Rachel, Jacob was forced to work another seven years.<eos> So, you see, the Bible clearly teaches us you can never trust an employer.<eos> And that is what the Bible teaches us?<eos> That is the lesson of the story of Jacob if you interpret it correctly.
B-O-C-A.<eos> - Never heard of him.<eos> - What about his wife Angie?<eos> Doesn't register.<eos> There's been some talk, though.<eos> - About what?<eos> - A shipment.<eos> Comin' in this week, the week after.<eos> Everybody's gonna get well.<eos> - Well, who's bringin' it?
Grab the shovel, Harold.<eos> Lady!<eos> Stop or I'll have to shoot.<eos> I sure am picking up on vices.<eos> Vice?<eos> Virtue?<eos> It's best not to be too moral.<eos> You cheat yourself out of too much life.<eos> Aim above morality.<eos> If you apply that to life, then you're bound to live it fully.
- Here.<eos> We appreciate you wanting to take a strong position.<eos> In fact, we admire it.<eos> - Ernie, do you want to?<eos> - No, you go ahead and say it.<eos> What we'd like to do is, we'd like to make a new approach.<eos> You remember our offer this evening?<eos> - No.<eos> - Well, it was $5,500.<eos> That's why I don't remember it. $5,500.
Hold these.<eos> I'm gonna need some help.<eos> Lisa will have to do.<eos> I hate to leave the kids alone too long.<eos> They get spooked.<eos> Watch your mouth.<eos> Some of the kids, you know what they say?<eos> What do some of the kids say?<eos> They say the Family comes in the night when it's dark.<eos> They say they're going to come some night and take Richie's soul... and tie it all up in a bag and give it to the devil.
As soon as she heard his key in the lock, she'd stop.<eos> And when he got inside, she wouldn't say a word.<eos> So one evening he made up his mind to hear what she was saying.<eos> - So he put the ladder...<eos> - No, he went round the back.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> He went round the back and got the ladder.<eos> - And he set it...<eos> - He carried it.<eos> Yes, he carried it round to the front of the house... and set it up against the window.
I'll have that checked out.<eos> Anything new on your end?<eos> Oh, yeah. Yeah, we got a couple of things.<eos> It seems as though Mrs Kennicut was having an affair, you see?<eos> Boy, this is delicious. How do you make this stuff?<eos> I'll have a recipe sent over to you. You were saying?<eos> Yeah. It seems as though Mrs Kennicut, she was having an affair.<eos> - And, er...<eos> - Oh? And... When you send the recipe, would you send it to the house?<eos> - Don't send it to the office.
I'll be back before the sun sets.<eos> Brother Fung, if you fight with Lung, ...you must guard against that special technique.<eos> He is a famous swordsman. Why would I fight with him?<eos> If he is a famous swordsman... why would he be with the gang of Tiger Mansion?<eos> Most likely he has been deceived. I'll sort it out.<eos> Well, I hope so too. Brother Fung, I'll await your return.<eos> Right on.<eos> That sword is still with me.<eos> Please take it back.<eos> To take it back in broad daylight... would get me a good scolding from dad. It's better to leave it with you.
Why with it you could bring good and peace to every world in the galaxy!<eos> On the contrary, he'll bring only death and destruction.<eos> This planet of yours could be the center of a mighty empire!<eos> The greatest that the cosmos has ever known!<eos> Tell me, sir, has this weapon of yours ever brought good to your planet?<eos> Once the weapon was built, our race began to decay.<eos> The radiation from the weapon's power source poisoned the soil of our planet.<eos> Exactly.<eos> The weapon has only brought death - and yet he wants to spread that death throughout the galaxy!<eos> Unless you destroy this weapon, sir, he will use it for evil.
- Do you have the result of the post mortem?<eos> - I have a requisition for you. Top priority.<eos> - Yes, asphyxiation, cause unknown.<eos> - It might have frightened him to death...<eos> Scanning molecular structure analyser.<eos> - ...but asphyxiation?<eos> Well, it's not alive.<eos> - Electrode unit.<eos> The Nestenes change the molecular structure of plastic, Captain Yates.<eos> They energise it in some way and turn it into quasi-organic matter.
Don't bother.<eos> Whoever receives this child in my name receives me and whoever receives me receives him who sent me;<eos> for he who is least among you all is the one who is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven.<eos> Do not forbid him; for he that is not against you is for you.<eos> ...Even before you mother died.<eos> At that time, money used to appear suddenly.<eos> Everyone could get rich. And that changed everything.<eos> We started to lose money.<eos> And that's when they offered me the charge of judge.<eos> At first, I didn't want it.
Stay there.<eos> Victor, bring me the hammer.<eos> Victor, bring me the key.<eos> Victor, bring me the scissors. Victor!<eos> No, not that.<eos> I shouldn't have neglected his natural inclination for order.<eos> Victor, hang the things up.<eos> Very good, Victor.<eos> Drink.<eos> Victor has always shown a marked preference for water, and the way he drinks it shows he finds great pleasure in it.
But no.<eos> No.<eos> She had to lie down in her own bedroom.<eos> I'm telling you, she's the queen mother.<eos> Huh.<eos> God, she's a pain in the ass.<eos> She can't help it if she's getting senile.<eos> - I'm all in.<eos> - Oh, listen.<eos> I'd better give you your mail before I forget it and walk off with it.
Why you can't marry me?<eos> Because I'm not a virgin?<eos> - No, because you're crazy!<eos> - You're crazy!<eos> - You all crazy!<eos> - Why are we crazy?<eos> Because you don't know how to stay alive and that's the secret of life.<eos> But we have a war to win.<eos> But America will lose the war.<eos> Italy will win it.
-Excuse me.<eos> -I should hope not.<eos> But it's still open to some dispute that there seems to be less aggression or violence, if you like....<eos> I'm sorry, I don't speak French.<eos> --and loftier natures....<eos> What kind of doggy is this?<eos> This is a Border collie.<eos> I had a pussycat once.<eos> It was a little fluffy thing.<eos> Bobby gave it to me.
He'll be back in a week.<eos> He must be sitting tight somewhere.<eos> Unless...<eos> Unless what?<eos> Unless he too believes he's changed into a bear.<eos> Then it'll be his mother's lot - insanity.<eos> I foresaw that too.<eos> You were aware of his state, and yet, you didn't help him.<eos> On the contrary, you drew him towards madness.<eos> I observed it and asked myself:
They must scrutinize the things they are offered... most critically... and select them with care... rejecting things of specious value... which are detrimental to human ideals.<eos> On the other hand, healthy, useful values... should be accepted... and combined with native ones... to strengthen these peoples' own special character.<eos> Lt is this rich humanism that should be developed.<eos> That is the only true humanism... the kind that opens itself to God in gratitude... for a calling that communicates the proper ideals of human life.<eos> Today, power is wielded... by an economically privileged minority.<eos> This minority will never act against its own interests.<eos> That is why the majority must organize itself... and take all necessary steps.<eos> No one should be excluded, unless he owns property... which gives him power and influence... over the have-nots.<eos> The land which is needed for the community... shall be expropriated without compensation.<eos> Lt shall belong to those who work it.
- Have a good flight.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Coffee or tea with dinner?<eos> - No coffee, tea. No dinner.<eos> - Nothing at all?<eos> - Please.<eos> George, maybe we should have a sandwich.<eos> You didn't have lunch.<eos> At 8.30 we're having a great meal.<eos> I'm not gonna spoil it with stale chicken.
- I don't understand.<eos> - What do you think about the song?<eos> What song?<eos> I'm very sorry, I wasn't listening as I was deep in my thoughts.<eos> Don't sing one more time.<eos> What was it about?<eos> Could you sum up in few words.<eos> I'll listen and think about it.<eos> It's short.<eos> You can put it in three sentences.
That's the problem.<eos> Don't interrupt me.<eos> He can't be singing seriously.<eos> You are misinterpreting this song.<eos> He's ironic, playful and humorous, about the subject of his song.<eos> Therefore I believe this song is not sad, pessimistic and, as you claim, grabs your heart, it's not tearful.<eos> In my opinion, this song is optimistic, cheerful, with many humorous elements.<eos> We need such cheerful, optimistic and sound songs.<eos> We even need sometimes humorous and ironic songs.<eos> So I would interpret it like this.
Turn around, Sheriff.<eos> I want you to see who's gonna kill you.<eos> You got your town back.<eos> I...<eos> I told you I'd kill him.<eos> - I told you, didn't I?<eos> - You told me.<eos> I had a right to.<eos> I'm gonna always wear this mark.<eos> And every time I look at it, I wanna know I had the right to kill him.
Answer me.<eos> With a little more elevation we will have a better view... Those above at number 14 see the enemy line perfectly.<eos> I don't think so!<eos> But I will have a look.<eos> Only one at a time can watch.<eos> Magnificent, absolutely magnificent.<eos> Very good, Lieutenant.<eos> This will be most useful for the attack.<eos> Continue watching...<eos> The position to the left... there is a white line... Do you see it?

- Aren't cars an effective blockade?<eos> - Cars?<eos> - Cars.<eos> - On a campus?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Strategically...<eos> - Wait, how about your car?<eos> It's a Ford Falcon, man.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You drive it up, Jack.
- Be prepared, is that your slogan?<eos> - Got to be realistic about it.<eos> Look, the day you don't count on losing is the day I'll join the movement.<eos> What if joining isn't a choice?<eos> For lots of people it's a matter of survival.<eos> - That's what I mean.<eos> - What?<eos> It's serious, it's not a game.<eos> I'm tired of it, man.<eos> Kids rapping about violence and cops doing it.
-Professor Stahlman.<eos> -Not now, Brigadier.<eos> I want you to reconnect the power to the Doctor's hut.<eos> Don't be ridiculous, my dear man.<eos> Professor Stahlman, the Doctor has disappeared.<eos> Excellent.<eos> At last he's done what he was told.<eos> No, no, you don't understand.<eos> He was engaged in an experiment and you switched off the power at a critical moment.<eos> Now you've got to restore it.
Stahlman, do be reasonable.<eos> I've been more than reasonable.<eos> Up till now, I've tolerated these crackpot experts and advisors and only offered a token objection. But now that we've accelerated the drilling programme,<eos> I won't be obstructed any further.<eos> You had no right to accelerate the programme without proper consultation with the Ministry.<eos> I have every right, Sir Keith.<eos> Very well. I'm sorry, but I shall have to refer the matter to the Minister.<eos> Please do. I can tell you exactly what he'll say.<eos> That this project is vital to our industrial future.<eos> The country needs the new power source and Stahlman is the only one who can give it to us.
He says he comes from a parallel world.<eos> Look, will somebody tell me what's going on?<eos> Where are we, Patterson?<eos> I don't recognise this.<eos> Different route, sir.<eos> Trying to avoid the traffic.<eos> -What's the matter with this thing?<eos> -No idea, sir. It was working on the way up.<eos> They going to slow down the drilling, sir?<eos> They're going to suspend it, pending a full review of the project.
-Zero minus two minutes, 1 0 seconds...<eos> -DOCTOR:<eos> Stahlman, get back!<eos> Sutton, the fire extinguishers!<eos> Fire extinguisher!<eos> Zero minus two minutes, zero seconds and counting.<eos> Condition Red Three now commences.<eos> BRIGADIER: That's Stahlman?<eos> SUTTON: What's happened to him?<eos> Petra, the drill, close it down.
I'll find it.<eos> Don't worry, you can study quietly.<eos> I'll find it I won't disturb!<eos> Shay, we were just kidding.<eos> I don't know what...<eos> -Oh, come on, forget it.<eos> The night is over.<eos> Look outside.<eos> You know, once a snake ran away in the lab.<eos> We looked for it everywhere, disassembled all closets.
Afterwards, the demonstration starts up again immediately.<eos> This leper, reciting a poem in Urdu, the language of India's Muslims, was once a government employee.<eos> The disease cost him his family and position and made him a beggar.<eos> There are between 70,000 and 80,000 lepers in Calcutta, nearly all beggars.<eos> The municipality can't cope with them.<eos> A charitable organization cares for some of them.<eos> I can't board a tram. I can't get on a bus.<eos> If I ask for tea, the hotelkeeper will say, "Have you got your own teapot?"<eos> He'll tell me to place it on the ground.<eos> He'll pour boiling water on it, touching it only after it's cleaned.
- I know, I'm very tall<eos> - How tall are you?<eos> - I don't know<eos> Is your mother pleased that you wear nylon stockings?<eos> No, she got mad at the idea, but I starting wearing them anyway and she stopped mentioning it<eos> - Do you wear a miniskirt?<eos> - Not miniskirts, short skirts<eos> Here today, tomorrow where?<eos> Here and there, I love freedom<eos> No one will take it away from me!
- Not miniskirts, short skirts<eos> Here today, tomorrow where?<eos> Here and there, I love freedom<eos> No one will take it away from me!<eos> For a bit you understood and<eos> I decided to stay with you<eos> But now you've taken all of me for yourself<eos> and soon I'll suffocate<eos> Here and there, I love freedom<eos> No one will take it away from me!
I decided to stay with you<eos> But now you've taken all of me for yourself<eos> and soon I'll suffocate<eos> Here and there, I love freedom<eos> No one will take it away from me!<eos> Today here, tomorrow there<eos> I like going along like that<eos> Without breaks, that's how I live<eos> Here and there, I love freedom<eos> No one will take it away from me!
Let's go then, Mr. Dvorak.<eos> May I smoke?<eos> Of course, if it makes you happy...<eos> No thanks, I don't smoke or drink. I'm a total abstainer.<eos> We can hear the ceremony through that speaker.<eos> Beautiful music everywhere...<eos> Do you do like music?<eos> Mr. Dvorak?<eos> Sensitive people love music.<eos> I really love it.
I'll be happy to play this for you, if you'll just come...<eos> - Who's going to tell the children?<eos> - The children?<eos> It's going to be tough explaining a horrible thing to three young children.<eos> Three.<eos> We have to tell them.<eos> Three.<eos> Well, I'll tell them.<eos> Julian is no good at that sort of thing.<eos> - How will they take it?
"Nearly four years locked up... and the sentence read:<eos> Death by firing squad".<eos> "Friends, my comrades, a favor before I die.<eos> Bring me my mother, I want to say good-bye".<eos> "Good-bye dear mother, root of all...<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> The guitar is turning out nice.<eos> I'm just learning.<eos> - Any sales outside?<eos> - I've got no one to sell it.
Gentlemen. Gentlemen, please.<eos> The 67th meeting of the European Space Exploration Council is now in session.<eos> This is a momentous occasion for our organization.<eos> Sun Probe One was an unqualified success.<eos> We had some spectacular results. However, this meeting is called to consider one single result, startling in its implications.<eos> Dr John Kane, the project director. Gentlemen, an unmanned satellite is naturally limited in the transmission of information.<eos> Part of the sun probe's equipment was a cine camera set to take one picture a minute for the duration of the flight.<eos> Roll the film, please. The far side of the sun, over 100 million miles from Earth, hidden from the eyes of radio telescopes by the sun itself.<eos> At this point, a strange thing happened.<eos> The gyro mechanisms aboard were influenced by another magnetic field and the capsule slowly started to rotate. If you watch your screens carefully, you'll see that the cine camera was panned off the sun towards the force that was attracting it.
There's an old story.<eos> The way the Apaches tell it a man was riding in the desert and came across a vulture the kind they call turkey buzzards in Arizona, sittin' on a rock.
Maybe we'll make some sense out of this.<eos> All right, the party's over.<eos> Get back to your posts, all of you.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Move!<eos> So now they were all together.<eos> The good citizens and the outlaws and Mackenna and the girl.<eos> They made for the waterhole at the old Brogan ranch because it was the last chance to fill up before they hit the desert.<eos> The Apaches had burnt out the old Brogan place about five years before.<eos> Nobody ever took it over because it was too far out. But everybody knew about the waterhole, and everybody used it.
Of course I am.<eos> I brought a little of my own wine.<eos> But nothing more, I'm sorry.<eos> We had a bad harvest this year.<eos> Wait, I'll be right back.<eos> My brother must've got rich.<eos> See what a business he has?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why don't you tell your brother to buy some flour for us here?<eos> I'll sell it in the village.
What are your interests?<eos> I haven't g-got any.<eos> I d-d-don't think.<eos> That is what I am for, Mary McGregor... to provide you with interests.<eos> You may sit down now, Mary.<eos> Little girls, I am in the business of putting old heads on young shoulders.<eos> All my pupils are the crème de la crème.<eos> Give me a girl at an impressionable age... and she is mine for life.<eos> You girls are my vocation.<eos> If I were to receive a proposal of marriage tomorrow... from the Lord Lyon, king of arms, I would decline it.
- We can be alone in my study.<eos> - Out here is just fine.<eos> I want to know how much you estimate the business is worth?<eos> Why?<eos> Do you want to sell?<eos> That's something to look into.<eos> We'll have to talk about it.<eos> On the island there are seven or eight men... who are in a position to buy it.<eos> No, that's not what I mean.<eos> I only want to sell it to you.
They'll need help with the churning!<eos> Mr. Cogburn!<eos> You can get a fugitive warrant for Chaney and $2 for bringing him in, plus 10 cents a mile for each of you, and I'll give you $50 reward!<eos> You've looked into this right smart.<eos> Yes, I mean business.<eos> What have you got in your poke?<eos> By God, girl, that's a Colt's Dragoon!<eos> You're no bigger than a corn nubbin. What are you doing with this pistol?<eos> My father carried it bravely in the war.<eos> I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it if the law fails.
Observe for example that ewe in that oak tree.<eos> She is clearly trying to teach her lamb to fly.<eos> Talk about the blind leading the blind.<eos> But why do they think they're birds?<eos> Another fair question.<eos> One thing is for sure, a sheep is not a creature of the air.<eos> It has enormous difficulty in the comparatively simple act of perching.<eos> As you see.<eos> As for flight, its body is totally unadapted to the problems of aviation.<eos> Trouble is, sheep are very dim and once they get an idea into their heads, there's no shifting it.
I was in this hat, they called me.<eos> One of them gave me a chocolate.<eos> It was on a cardboard.<eos> And he started to ask me where's father, where's mother, where's brother.<eos> Later they gave us rifles and took a photo.<eos> That's what I remember.<eos> I don't remember more details.<eos> I was a child, 8 years old.<eos> Do you remember how did the soldier look like?<eos> Even if I'd tried to reconstruct the whole story, I won't recall it.
This skin... this shape...<eos> You stay asleep for a while.<eos> What do you want, Horicho?<eos> Lord Nambara you kindly pointed out my error the other day.<eos> It was quite alarming for me.<eos> Would you tell me more about the expression of agony?<eos> Your tattoos don't look real.<eos> I cannot imagine it.<eos> You can't ever.<eos> I see it all the time when I'm on duty.
I made an appointment but when I arrived... I found him dead.<eos> The corpses are piling up around here, Inspector!<eos> I've prepared the bath for her.<eos> Very good Bertha, we'll be away for a few days.<eos> Sir, I wanted to tell you that I found a mouse in the kitchen last night.<eos> Look in that cupboard there.<eos> There's a bottle of Toxsifid poison...<eos> Take it.<eos> -I've looked but it's vanished, Sir.<eos> I hope nobody has swallowed it.
You are not vampires.<eos> I just met the lord of the manor, here in the woods.<eos> Everything he said confirmed my suspicions.<eos> I will cure them, but I need your help.<eos> Do you think we can trust him?<eos> No, but who can we trust?<eos> Their lies aren't deliberate, they have become a habit.<eos> They have been surrounded by crosses.<eos> To fight their illness we must fight its creator.<eos> If anything happens to Brigitte, you will pay for it.
Do you read me, Hal?<eos> Affirmative, Dave.<eos> I read you.<eos> Open the pod bay doors, Hal.<eos> I'm sorry, Dave.<eos> I'm afraid I can 't do that.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.<eos> What are you talking about, Hal?<eos> This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.
I'm wearing my gun tied down, and if I have to, I am going to use it.<eos> A man'd be a fool not to wear a gun and a bigger fool to use it too fast.<eos> Someone who meant no harm could die reaching for a chew of tobacco.<eos> You listen to Nick Evers and Rincon will have more dead than Gettysburg.<eos> I'll tell you this:<eos> I can't control the miners much longer, they're rounding up hotheads.<eos> Either you do something or they will, and I can't say I blame them.<eos> Nick says wear your gun and use it fast.<eos> Mr Morgan says wear it and use it slow.<eos> I say don't wear it and you won't use it at all.

he reaches under the sideboard with his big hand, ready to butcher and eat the children, like chicken!<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> This is a nice story by Perrault!<eos> - Your villa must be beautiful.<eos> - Yes, baby, you'll see.<eos> There's a small living room, a small kitchen, and a big, big bed; You can "WalloW" in it.<eos> That bed was made especially for "WALLOWING".<eos> Look out!<eos> Would you give us a can of gas?<eos> Yes, but only if you use it to set yourself on fire.
Don't overdo it!<eos> You're behaving like a woman!<eos> Here's my man.<eos> Mine.<eos> Oh!<eos> I almost forgot!<eos> When are you coming back?<eos> Are we starting again with your questions?<eos> Silvana, do you want me to get the agreement?<eos> I'm going to read it again.
Where do you sleep?<eos> Where's...? Anywhere.<eos> All right, come here.<eos> - Colonel Kirby? - Affirmative!<eos> Lt. Jamison, 91st Navy Seabee detachment out of Cho Min.<eos> This is Captain MacDanial.<eos> We'd have come sooner, but the Marines wanted a strip up north.<eos> It's going to get a little hairy around here, Lieutenant so we're glad to see you, late or not.<eos> The rest of my outfit will be coming with the heavy equipment.<eos> They set it down right where the work is.
Keep still.<eos> I can understand they took my money but why Jane?<eos> Why did they kill her?<eos> People like those seven don't need a reason to kill a person.<eos> Yes, that's true.<eos> They were seven and left me seven dollars.<eos> I'll bring one for each of them.<eos> And after the seventh...<eos> Mike!<eos> Don't worry about the land, I won't sell it.
On 16th June 1955 aircraft supported by some navy units attacked the government house and the city centre.<eos> As in 1945, workers suddenly left their factories, and flooded into the city to support Perón.<eos> For the first time in the country's history, civilians were the target of a mass bombing.<eos> They demanded weapons from the army, to no avail.<eos> Provided with old shotguns, sticks and tiles they tried to assault the Navy Ministry and were repelled by Gorilla machine guns.<eos> The workers collaborated with the army in a battle lasting just a few hours.<eos> The movement had gone through its first blood and fire ordeal.<eos> The victory cost over 300 civilian deaths.<eos> A few days later Perón requested a ceasefire from the enemy.<eos> "... Very consternated by the facts and circumstances we offer an open hand in good faith hoping that our enemy will hold on to it.
You can't leave.<eos> Have you seen God?<eos> You have... so you feel guilt.<eos> Earlier, having survived your death, you weren't human.<eos> But now...<eos> Do you understand why you stopped?<eos> You were about to step out into the nation.<eos> Where you're standing is also the nation.<eos> You said the nation was invisible.<eos> But now you see it.

Sounds pretty obvious to me.<eos> Anyway, it can't be me who's lying, because last night I dreamt, and if you're dreaming you're sleeping, and if you're sleeping you can't go out.<eos> What did you dream about last night?<eos> Hide.<eos> We're here to work... to work... on the preparation of a show. When we're ready something will happen.<eos> For the moment remove the chairs and desks.<eos> Sit down in a circle.<eos> Ninetto, get up.<eos> Ninetto plays the Jew's harp.<eos> Jean Robert lights a cigarette... and offers it to Salvatore.
Nothing's happening.<eos> Things aren't as we see them, or most of the time, as we hear them.<eos> They're as theatre shows them. Things fall prey to evil... meaning unreality.<eos> Theatre is one of the means which lead mankind to reality.<eos> Things were real in the beginning, the world in its infancy was real, it had a resonance for mankind.<eos> Seeing the world at the time... was to see the infinite.<eos> For grace... for happiness... 37.<eos> The moral is...<eos> You need a bottle...<eos> Fill it one-third full of sand.
- Guy?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I'm going to Dr Hill Monday morning.<eos> Dr Sapirstein is either lying, or he's...<eos> I don't know, out of his mind.<eos> Pain like this is a warning something's wrong.<eos> - Rosemary...<eos> - I'm not drinking Minnie's drink.<eos> I want vitamins and pills like everyone else.<eos> I haven't drunk it for three days.
Hello, Gussie.<eos> Come on.<eos> Say it. Repeat after me, "Hello, Gussie."<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Say it. "Hello, Gussie."<eos> Hello, Gussie.<eos> Hello, Gussie!<eos> Do you like my beard?<eos> No.<eos> We'll cut it off. Right now.
They haven't time.<eos> We promised to stop at the Grahams' for a quick drink.<eos> - Will you come?<eos> - Of course he will.<eos> - You haven't seen their pool, have you?<eos> - Whose?<eos> - The Grahams.<eos> - The Grahams put in a pool?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> They nurse it like a baby.
Why can't we travel more?<eos> What for?<eos> We've got everything we want right here.<eos> - How come you never put a pool in?<eos> - Never got around to it.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> Helps the resale value.<eos> I don't have to worry about the resale value.<eos> With a tennis court and the planting, you'll get a lot more than you paid.<eos> If I ever sell it.
"Prepare the divan, then," he said.<eos> I went to the green divan in my father's room, took some cushions, and stacked them.<eos> Then I fetched the cane, unbuttoned my trousers, and leaned forward onto the cushions.<eos> He said, "So how many strokes do you deserve?"<eos> And I answered, "As many strokes as possible."<eos> And he struck me with the cane, hard enough but not more than I could bear.<eos> When the caning was over, I went to Mother and asked,<eos> "Mother, can you forgive me now?"<eos> And she cried and said, "Of course I forgive you."<eos> Then she offered me her hand. I kissed it.
The wait shouldn't be much longer.<eos> Please pass the tray.<eos> Do you work here? .<eos> Yes, I'll be working as a masseur and acupuncturist.<eos> Please give this to the doctor.<eos> Thankyou very much.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Carp.<eos> Can't beat fresh carp as an accompaniment for sake.<eos> I'll mix some medicine for him, so come get it later.
But we'll return to the El Dorado at 7:30 tomorrow morning... to bring you the start of the second and the final lap back to Yosemite Valley.<eos> Good night, everyone.<eos> A little bird's nest soup never hurt anyone.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> I hope this holds together. I'm puttin' welds on top of welds.<eos> Mr Wu, the wiring is mostly all burned off. The cylinder walls are scored; the carburettor's a mess;<eos> This little car ripped itself to pieces trying to get us here.<eos> It gave us everything it's got.<eos> Now, maybe we can patch it back together. I don't know. But how can I send it back into that rat race tomorrow?
It gave us everything it's got.<eos> Now, maybe we can patch it back together. I don't know. But how can I send it back into that rat race tomorrow?<eos> It's got nothing left to give.<eos> It's your car.<eos> What do you say?<eos> A wise man once said,<eos> "When you come to last page, close the book. "<eos> You let that little car get under your skin, didn't you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's a lot of gloop been written about, uh, the bond between a man and his automobile and... how he hates it sometimes, mostly how he loves it.
Bring me water and a clean piece of cloth.<eos> Let's see this.<eos> Hurry!<eos> - That damned wall!<eos> - It's just a bruise.<eos> - Does it hurt?<eos> - Not much.<eos> Come on! Bear it like a man.<eos> "Much would I give, madam, to see your hair on your back.<eos> I'd extend it slowly and kiss it.
- There!<eos> My big baby.<eos> Was it good?<eos> You look better already.<eos> Okay. There's no time to lose.<eos> Now we strike back.<eos> But first I have to call Dr. Freedom.<eos> Aha!<eos> So, Mr. Freedom, you want to escape.<eos> An old Chinese proverb say... he who picks up rock drops it on foot.
Then I don't remember a thing.<eos> Then I find myself in front of a poster and I read about what I've done.<eos> I read and I read.<eos> I did that?<eos> I don't remember anything.<eos> But who believes me?<eos> Who knows what is going on inside me?<eos> How it screams and cries out inside me, when I have to do it.<eos> Don't want to. Must!<eos> And then a voice cries out, and I can't listen to it any more!
Uncle Ned!<eos> Yes, it was quite an amazing experience.<eos> But, for me, anyway, a lot of good came of this.<eos> Um, being the only survivor, naturally, I inherited the wealth of the Merryes, which, later, turned out to be... quite vast!<eos> More important than that, though, my wife.<eos> That's our daughter, Jessica.<eos> Mummy, may I go outside now?<eos> All right, Jessica, dear, but come back into the house if it starts raining again.<eos> Oh, I will, Mummy.<eos> And so the Merrye syndrome was extinguished for ever with the family that carried it.
There's also a cloudy sky, provided I tum my head and don't stare straight ahead, and words on the walls.<eos> Why all these signs that make me distrust language and submerge me in meanings, drowning reality, not freeing it of the imaginary?<eos> With images, anything goes - the best and the worst.<eos> Before me, ordinary common sense repairs the broken process of my reason. Objects exist.<eos> If we pay more attention to them than to people, it's because they exist more than those people.<eos> Dead objects are still alive. Living persons are often already dead.<eos> All I'm doing is looking for reasons to live happily.<eos> And if I now take this inquiry further, I find there's simply a reason to live.<eos> First, because there are memories. Then there's the present, and the ability to stop and savor it.<eos> Meaning, we have seized a reason to live as it goes by and held on to it for a few seconds, after its discovery amid the unique circumstances surrounding it.
I've been working all morning, I hope I will be able to take a rest sometime.<eos> Where are you going ?<eos> - Can I see the Druid prepare the antidote ?<eos> No, better not, you would hinder us.<eos> You are too nervous.<eos> You guards, watch this tent, see to it they don't escape.<eos> Well that's good.<eos> You see, Asterix, here in the small pot I have prepared ... our real magic potion.<eos> I think we will need your muscles if we are to get out ... of here and here in the big pot I've prepared the antidote:<eos> water, salt, vegetables and a marrow bone, since we have to taste it in front... of the Romans I thought you would like something good.
I have no time to lose.<eos> What, 1000 francs?<eos> For the mirror?<eos> The mirror is worth 300 and the moped 2000.<eos> ... if you don't like it...<eos> It didn't go amiss.<eos> Well. And now let's go for the plait.<eos> Hello. Good morning madam, it's me.<eos> Yes, you gave your telephone number.<eos> I have a wonderful red wig. Do you want it?
- What brings you here?<eos> I'm looking for a gun for a fella that can't shoot. Mississippi.<eos> Swede Larson.<eos> - Can you help us?<eos> - I've got just what you want.<eos> Good.<eos> How wide will that shot spread?<eos> How big a pattern?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The fellow who used it before, he couldn't see too good.
A savage.<eos> I don't know why you say that.<eos> I was thinking about it in English.<eos> It's so hot out there, that wash dried while I was hanging it.<eos> - I don't think this meat is fresh.<eos> - Don't think about it, just cook it.<eos> It smells funny.<eos> Do you think it'll be all right?<eos> JESSIE: If you put a lot of chili peppers into it.<eos> I wouldn't eat it myself on a bet.
An official report says at least one bus filled with passengers has fallen into the Thames.<eos> Divers are descending to search for other vehicles.<eos> None of the victims have been identified as yet.<eos> We shall bring you any further news at the next bulletin.<eos> That's unbelievable.<eos> Yes, hello?<eos> Who?<eos> Oh, Pimm, I didn't recognize your voice.<eos> Well, yes, I heard it a moment ago.<eos> Well, I remember you saying something, but I didn't take it seriously.
What about Jowita?<eos> She doesn't exist.<eos> Who is he?<eos> It's Szymaniak.<eos> He was my first coach when I did boxing.<eos> I thought I could be a champion.<eos> I finally gave it up.<eos> Can you see this chain?<eos> It's the only memento from that time.<eos> I got it from Szymaniak after my first boxer step.
Operator!<eos> Sergeant, what's happened to the direct line?<eos> The line's been cut.<eos> - What?<eos> - Sandauer! Sir?<eos> Where's my call to Berlin?<eos> The line has been cut, sir, according to the colonel.<eos> Then use the radio.<eos> Put it through to my office. Yes, sir.<eos> Sergeant, get me Berlin on the radio and put it through to the general's office.
Don't you have anything to do?<eos> Can't you see the customers are waiting?<eos> Wake up!<eos> Not bad.<eos> Well done.<eos> Go change your clothes.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Look what happened.<eos> My bow tie fell in the sauce.<eos> I'll give it back to you.
- They tell me he's the worst paranoid.<eos> - Is that so?<eos> - Who, Willy Williams?<eos> - Willy Williams.<eos> You'd think he was just so relaxed, and you'd think he'd been doing it for years.<eos> Yeah, and he's a paranoid!<eos> They can't reach him.<eos> You reach him, Allison.<eos> It is a letter from an inmate of mine. They sent me this letter.<eos> I wish you could read it, really.
I've had an idea.<eos> - Sleep well?<eos> - Very well.<eos> I had a dreamy dream.<eos> Tell me the worst.<eos> I dreamt you built us the most beautiful little Wallace-designed house.<eos> And I built the most beautiful little Wallace-designed triplets.<eos> All we need right now is a population explosion.<eos> You did not need the mosquito net?<eos> We managed without it.
An air raid nearby?<eos> What did he sense?<eos> Poor Kinou.<eos> The battle of France has begun.<eos> Throughout the nation, throughout the empire, throughout our armed forces, there is but one single resolve, one single hope.<eos> They killed him.<eos> They killed him.<eos> Prime Minister Laval will address you.<eos> You have tuned in, as you do every day at this hour, to hear the voice of Philippe Henriot.<eos> You will hear it no more.
- I don't know what to say.<eos> Say nothing.<eos> Take me in to lunch.<eos> - Okay, the room's empty.<eos> - Good.<eos> He'll be taking his nap right after lunch.<eos> I better get up there.<eos> One wrong move and you're dead.<eos> Take off your tie.<eos> Your tie, take it off.
My wallet.<eos> I'll give you the rest when the job is done.<eos> All right, Mr. Hagar, you've got a deal.<eos> We'll be seeing each other again very soon, Mr. Hagar.<eos> Interesting game.<eos> Yes, it is, the way Erik plays it.<eos> I'm afraid I need a lot of practice.<eos> Do you think it's possible I could learn?<eos> Of course.<eos> You rest the cue on the rail like that, then you slide it between your fingers like this.
I think I just got a much bigger story than the one I came here for.<eos> I'm sorry you heard that conversation, Miss Carter.<eos> I'm not, Senator.<eos> You can't print that story.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Senator, if I phone in the story of your appointment,<eos> Newsworld can scoop every publication in this country.<eos> I'm telling you, you can't do that.<eos> Perhaps we can strike a bargain.<eos> You give us the story of your appointment exclusively and authorise a cover to go with it and we'll hold off publication until our next issue.
Dan, they generally don't invite guests to this sort of an affair.<eos> We won't be guests.<eos> To Jack Wellman there's only one place in town where you can get a really good meal, from Tino's.<eos> Listen, Dan, I've been thinking about this.<eos> I've catered a lot of Wellman's affairs, but he'll never call me for anything this private.<eos> He's got a regular couple who work for him.<eos> He'll use them.<eos> Not this time, Tino.<eos> Has Barney checked you out on the saw?<eos> She'll be able to take care of it.
How could I ever forget?<eos> That picture, Herr Rudd, is my strength.<eos> Each time I look at it, I rededicate my life to the memory of that man<eos> - and all he stood for.<eos> - I understand, of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And now I must go.<eos> I beg you, Herr Rudd, if there is anything you need, please, I want you to know there is one person here that you can count on.<eos> Good night.<eos> Therefore, it's Martin Bormann's belief that violence best serves the men who use it most skilfully.
Oh, my God! What is it? !<eos> Arkhipushka!<eos> BUFFOON 1400<eos> Moscow is full of painters even without us.<eos> Don't worry, we'll find some job.<eos> Sure.<eos> But it's still annoying that...<eos> Yes. Take this birch-tree.<eos> Every day you walked by, without noticing it.<eos> But when you know that you won't see it again...
Darling, don't ask me to speak with my mouth full.<eos> You know, at dinner, just for a moment, I thought you deliberately knocked over the plate and gave a note to Mr Pollock.<eos> Imagine.<eos> That really is extraordinary.<eos> - Jealous?<eos> You?<eos> - I'm jealous of your thoughts, Yasmin.<eos> I'm jealous of everything I can't see or hear.<eos> Your shower's still running.<eos> - I'll turn it off.
Anyway, the pay is good.<eos> It's not the money.<eos> I swear it. It's my family.<eos> Oh, look, everyone's got problems, including me, so I'd just as soon not get mixed up in yours.<eos> But you are mixed up in them, whether you like it or not.<eos> Beshraavi wants to rule our country with his money, General Ali with his guns.<eos> Both must know what's in that inscription.<eos> That means they need you.<eos> David, you must believe that I hate them both, that I'm only doing what they want because I have to.<eos> If you can translate the inscription and we can get it to my embassy, we'll both be safe.
Come, come here, sweety.<eos> Come here, you stupid thing, I'll give you a reward.<eos> - Here's your bar of sugar.<eos> - That's what you got?<eos> Gentleman, we've a good bargain for you.<eos> We, ah... Otoni, known as The Fighter, for God's will...<eos> Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, Lord of Saxon...<eos> Duke of Battenburg and of Poemwritten, concedes to the owner... of this parchment... the possession of this City and of the Fortress... of Aurocastro in Pulha, with the vineyards, the cattle... and all the riches in there.<eos> The Feudal Gentleman has to make a sublime vow... to rule the city through wisdom and eliminating, etc... etc.<eos> We received this parchment from a great and noble Gentleman... that gave it to us when he was dying.
Longs again to be God knows who!<eos> With hand to throat he wants to begin again!<eos> Longs again to be God knows who!<eos> And he straightens his tie<eos> I put snow in but it still smoulders.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - Some cabaret numer.<eos> I put snow in because I couldn't open it.<eos> - It's not worth putting out.<eos> - Why carry it then?
I was scared to say so then but a few years later, I went to the sheriff, old Sunshine.<eos> -He told me not to worry.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> If it makes you feel any better to come tell me all this then you did it, and I don't like it. Now it's time to go on home, Edwin.<eos> -We'll see you.<eos> -Well, I don't like it either.<eos> Well, a lot of years go by....<eos> All right, here it is.<eos> Night before Bubber goes to jail this last time somebody tells him the story.<eos> And he acted mighty mean when he heard it.
Hit it!<eos> 24 seconds left.<eos> Including three to revive him.<eos> 19 seconds, Doctor.<eos> The semilunar valve should be on our left any second now.<eos> Stand by to revive.<eos> - There it is.<eos> - Bear to your left.<eos> - Can you see it, Captain?<eos> - Yes. I see it now.
You heard the man...<eos> Machine guns have reduced our rehearsal to 12 minutes.<eos> It will be a nice performance tonight!<eos> Let me through.<eos> The nerve.<eos> Stopping a rehearsal!<eos> I am French...<eos> The Germans... Please help.<eos> I am fed up, fed up!<eos> Open the door or we break it open.
Where's Papa?<eos> He's working tonight.<eos> You can sleep with mama here.<eos> Oh, this thing is heavy, isn't it.<eos> What's wrong mama?<eos> Mama gets tears in her eyes when she's happy.<eos> That's strange isn't it?<eos> Funny eyes, aren't they.<eos> I've brought your water.<eos> Please leave it over there.
I certainly want to avoid undercutting someone else's position.<eos> But you should be able to explain mathematics for me.<eos> Yes, as far as mathematics is concerned, a natural and purely mathematical context does indeed exist.<eos> But as a good scientist, I'd have to use hypotheses that you would probably not yet understand.<eos> And then, too, we don't have the time.<eos> And imaginary numbers?<eos> You must get used to the idea that such mathematical concepts, entirely nonexistent values, are purely notional concepts necessary to mathematics.<eos> Think about it:<eos> At the elementary stage of your present instruction, it's difficult to provide a comprehensive explanation.<eos> Fortunately, very few feel the need for it.
And then make him sing psalms of thanks.<eos> It would be interesting to hear the expression in his singing, every note shrouded in fear.<eos> But there's something else I have in mind for him first.<eos> Reiting, you may leave if you're too dumb to grasp something profound.<eos> You recall our conversation about imaginary numbers?<eos> We needed to find a way to overcome the inadequacy of reason.<eos> This force that keeps logic together despite its gaps and shortcomings... I call the soul.<eos> I'd like to lure this soul out of Basini... by hypnotizing him.<eos> Because of your unworthy conduct, you've lost touch with your soul.<eos> You're about to find it again.
The sentence of the court is that you be taken to the Tower of London until the day hence to the appointment for your execution!<eos> I am commanded by the King to be brief and since I am the King's obedient subject brief I will be.<eos> I die His Majesty's good servant but God's first.<eos> I forgive you, right readily.<eos> Be not afraid of your office.<eos> You send me to God.<eos> You're very sure of that, Sir Thomas?<eos> He will not refuse one who is so blithe to go to him.<eos> Thomas More's head was stuck on Traitor's Gate for a month.<eos> Then his daughter, Margaret, removed it and kept it 'til her death.
He also turned out to be a friend.<eos> - Worth dying for?<eos> N- lf l have to.<eos> What about the others?<eos> They're along for the fight.<eos> it would be another.<eos> Get up in the bell tower.NWatch off toward the cemetery.<eos> it'll be from there.<eos> And Chico.<eos> Don't get too attached to that gun.NWhen this is over... I'll throw it in the water bucket...
That's no answer!<eos> What's happening to me now?<eos> Don't shout!<eos> Please!<eos> "Blessed shalt thou be coming in... and blessed shalt thou be in going out.<eos> And He said, 'Thou canst not see My face... for no man can see Me and live."'<eos> "I am the Resurrection and the Life.<eos> He that believeth in Me... though he were dead, shall yet he live.<eos> And a stranger shalt thou not oppress, seeing ye yourselves were strangers."<eos> "He that loveth life shall lose it... and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
It's really good.<eos> What do you mean, good? It's simply enchanting!<eos> Please, go on! Play some more.<eos> You enjoy it, little Countess?<eos> He plays very well, doesn't he?<eos> That's not the way to do it.<eos> You should hear trills there, all's well, quick march!<eos> Can you play, Uncle?<eos> Anisya, will you see if the strings are all right on the guitar?<eos> I haven't touched it for a long time, all's well, quick march!
Mother and I have always been very close.<eos> And the best thing about her is... She takes a good punch!<eos> He hit her, boss! That's the way to treat a mother?<eos> I saw you took our picture with that.<eos> You had a hidden camera, I saw it.<eos> I want some of them.<eos> - How many do you want?<eos> - Two 8 x 10.<eos> Yes, I took your picture with a camera hidden in that case the one I threw overboard.<eos> Let's stop kidding each other. You have the recipe and I want it. What recipe?
Shepard Wong's ship - it's supposed to leave tomorrow.<eos> But if this recipe means so much to Wong, he won't leave, will he?<eos> I don't know why, but you got a better bandage than I did!<eos> They got away...<eos> You think that's bad? They gave me a great bandage, but they made me wear my coat over it, so no one can see it!<eos> Will you two stop arguing about your bandages, look at me!<eos> I didn't get any bandage at all!<eos> Hey, boss!<eos> Shepard Wong's ship is not leaving tomorrow.<eos> Because Wong definitely needs the recipe. - And he needs it badly...
We'll use the occasion to celebrate.<eos> So, is it a deal?<eos> - We'll see, Mom.<eos> - What's there to think about?<eos> Come on in.<eos> Misha, tell us the story about the two actors.<eos> About what?<eos> The two actors.<eos> - I've told it already.<eos> - Victor hasn 't heard it.
- I'm giving you the gist of it, you know.<eos> - Go on giving me the gist of it.<eos> Look, I owed the bookies 40 quid.<eos> The coppers were a bit sensitive about a car I bought on the never-and-never, and flogged over in Clapham.<eos> And there was Blondie standing over me like me own conscious, rifling a wad of notes as thick as a pack of cards in me ear hole.<eos> "Well, what's your proposition?" I says.<eos> "I'm shy," he says.<eos> "I wanna car that nobody'll notice, with something fast under the bonnet.<eos> "Keep it teed up for me every first and third Tuesday of the month."<eos> He give me 500 quid to buy the car, 20 quid in advance for the first month's garaging, and he says, "There'll be a bonus for every extra day I take it out."
Seen better days.<eos> Eyes screwed in cig smoke.<eos> Shaves when it shows.<eos> She ought to try a wax treatment.<eos> Maybe I ought to tell her.<eos> "Excuse me, madam.<eos> A moment of your time.<eos> For small consideration, I can rid you of your hairy complex.<eos> One treatment.<eos> Hot wax on, rip it off.

Don't be so sure;<eos> I have a secret, too.<eos> What is your secret?<eos> Tell me, Mr. Caution.<eos> Something which never changes, day or night. The past represents its future, it advances in a straight line, yet it ends by coming full circle.<eos> I cannot trace it.<eos> I won't tell you.<eos> Several of my circuits are looking for the solution to your riddle.<eos> I will find it.<eos> If you find it, you will destroy yourself simultaneously, because you will become my kin, my brother.
- Wait.<eos> Come on!<eos> Jump.<eos> Hey, wait a minute.<eos> Where we going?<eos> We're supposed to be in Ambleve.<eos> We'll get there. I gotta make a pickup first.<eos> - Pickup?<eos> - I got some merchandise in a farmhouse.<eos> Germans are coming. They'll steal it.
My father never smiled like that.<eos> He'll smile on now, forever, just as you see him.<eos> Free from Wolf City's Development Corporation.<eos> - You rat!<eos> Get out!<eos> - Have respect for the dead!<eos> We dug a grave behind the barn.<eos> We'll stay to make sure you leave before morning.<eos> All right, you take the ranch.<eos> I don't want it, now that he's gone.
- Slavic Studies.<eos> - Russian?<eos> - To be an interpreter or travel agent.<eos> - Like it here?<eos> - It's a health resort.<eos> - Cut the jokes!<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> When do we apply for a pardon?<eos> - It's too early.<eos> - Where do we send it?
You got it.<eos> - Only we're not gonna eat it.<eos> - Eat it?<eos> - Eat what?<eos> What's he talking about?<eos> - Rat meat.<eos> You're out of your mind.<eos> Who would buy rat meat?<eos> Let me finish.<eos> Of course nobody will buy it if they know it's rat.
- I like the twist of a good screw.<eos> - I'm bound.<eos> You can't get a good splinter these days.<eos> The art's gone out of it.<eos> It's quicker by tube.<eos> I'm bound to ask for a good finish.<eos> I say...<eos> - Shame to hide a good screw.<eos> - Workers' Playtime.<eos> She took off her wooden leg, and she put it on the mantelpiece.
"Wipe it on, Windowlene, wipe it off, window clean."<eos> Washing with water and polishing with paper would have less electrostatic action.<eos> Would repel dirt more efficiently.<eos> Try the other half.<eos> Go on.<eos> - What?<eos> - The other half.<eos> You do realize that in order to clean the window you have to wipe off the cleaner.<eos> The white stuff has to be polished off the window.<eos> - He's not going to leave it on.
Back! Back!"<eos> To the bars.<eos> This is a critical moment, when the lion realizes... that he must leap at his attacker.<eos> Otherwise, it'll be too late. The trainer recognizes the critical moment.<eos> So at the moment the lion rears to attack, the trainer draws back... and the lion, no longer threatened, drops his forepaws... and finds himself standing on the box.<eos> Do this a few times, you've trained a lion to stand on a box.<eos> Colin.<eos> How did the box get there?<eos> - You've still got it in your hand.<eos> - The trainer puts it there.
If you want to be an idealist, you must also be tolerant.<eos> Are you running from the police?<eos> So much pride.<eos> Even you must have a name.<eos> - Jim.<eos> - That's all?<eos> Jim?<eos> A man of mystery, huh?<eos> Today, you risked your life for who-knows-what reason.<eos> Would you risk it again for ambition, chivalry, adventure?
You're the only one I can talk to.<eos> Willard, that's enough.<eos> I said, that's enough.<eos> I owe him.<eos> Leave him alone!<eos> Now, Josephson, get me a cloth, would you, please?<eos> It was generous of you to come, David.<eos> I'll try not to hurt you, David.<eos> Violence is something new to you, isn't it?<eos> Well, I can't say that I care very much for it myself, but more and more people seem to be craving it as part of their lives.
Don't say that.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Ten minutes ago, I saw only death. Now it's just the opposite.<eos> Look! The sea, the waves, the sky.<eos> Life may be sad, but it's always beautiful.<eos> Suddenly I feel free.<eos> We can do what we want.<eos> Watch: right... left...<eos> left... right. Look at the fool!<eos> He's driving down a straight line and has to follow it all the way.
Start the car.<eos> Trust me and I'll trust you. ...18, 19, 20, 21, 22...<eos> Something wrong, pal?<eos> It's that tune.<eos> You have no idea what it means to me.<eos> You hear it?<eos> No, I don't hear anything.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> That tune's my whole life.<eos> When I hear it, it just -
I asked, "Will you give me your hand?"<eos> She said, "You've been holding it for ten minutes. "<eos> And she was right.<eos> So I kept her and her hand for ten years!<eos> Ten years!<eos> I can't stand that song anymore!<eos> You hear it?<eos> I can't stand it anymore.<eos> You hear it?<eos> That one, right there - you don't hear it?
There he is.<eos> Who's that with him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're under arrest, Doctor Hoffman.<eos> You're Lee Barrett, aren't you? That's right.<eos> What are you doing here, Barrett?<eos> That's a long story.<eos> Get out of the car, Doctor. BARRETT:<eos> Be careful, he's got a flask in his pocket.<eos> All right, hand it over, Doctor. Right now.
At the monastery, they don't give us wine anymore... we drink water with cumin and pepper.<eos> The Priest says that it fortifies.<eos> You have eaten nearly nothing for five days.<eos> You have hardly touched water.<eos> It's foul.<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> No.<eos> Go in peace, let me fight my war.<eos> Your war?<eos> Innocent is the one who still ignores it !
If you are referring to an official entry form... for my London to Paris air race, my office will send you one.<eos> Well, considering the fact that I'm one of England's foremost aeroplanists... it's rather jolly inefficient of them not to send me one before.<eos> I say, excuse me, if you'll hold your mallet like this... you'll play that shot much better.<eos> I shall hold my mallet as I've always held my mallet.<eos> In that case, you'll miss the shot.<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> Missed the shot.<eos> Well, I expect we'll be seeing you again soon, Sir Percy.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Glad you're going to join the race.<eos> I'm not only going to join it, dear boy, I'm going to win it.
I'm doing nearly 40 miles an hour as it is, sir.<eos> Come down at once!<eos> I absolutely forbid it!<eos> Marvelous!<eos> - It's fun, isn't it? - Yes!<eos> Oh, look, look! Look, there's Father.<eos> Let's give him a fright.<eos> Oh, rats!<eos> I broke a wing strut.<eos> You take over the stick and keep it steady, will ya? Oh, no. L...
The little idiot thought he can slip out of our hands.<eos> Are you an Israelite?<eos> Worse:<eos> Political. - I didn't ask you.<eos> - I see.<eos> Please sign here.<eos> - Got a pencil?<eos> - I report I had a little piece.<eos> Why do you need a pencil, you dirty swine?<eos> You won't write with it even more.
If it's something a blind man can do -<eos> It'll really help me out if you do this for me.<eos> What is it?<eos> I need you to deliver this to a maid named Osen who works at the Musashi Inn.<eos> I get it.<eos> I'm blind, so you know I can't read your letter.<eos> It's not a love letter.<eos> Is that right?<eos> I guess I jumped to conclusions.<eos> But it's important that no one else sees it.
A tracking shot is style, but style is a moral question.<eos> I remember a tracking shot by Nicholas Ray of 360 degrees, which is one of the highest moral moments, and thus "engage"', in the film history.<eos> - A 360-degree tracking shot... - You're a reactionary. ...360-degree of morality.<eos> - Maybe I should laugh, but I can't.<eos> I'm just a bore who rattles off lists of films, and tonight you need to be alone.<eos> Maybe you're right. I'm off.<eos> Take my scarf.<eos> - It's cold out. - It doesn't matter.<eos> I live close by!<eos> I want you to take it.
You stay out of this!<eos> Wait, I'll show you the difference!<eos> - Leave her alone!<eos> HELLO!<eos> You said: 'ello...<eos> Do you hear the difference?<eos> HELLO!<eos> 'ello...<eos> What a nut!<eos> - Don't you hear it?
But they're not playing.<eos> - They don't.<eos> So I'll come back.<eos> Hello, Pavla.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Shall we dance?<eos> I don't want to dance with you, Mr. Mara.<eos> What are you doing here then?<eos> - Waiting for a lemonade.<eos> And who's getting it for you?
What's the matter?<eos> What is it?<eos> Well,...<eos> Okay then.<eos> So, I would talk it over.<eos> You know, when you loaned me that twenty, so, I would give them back, but I gave the money,<eos> I just stuck it in my pocket. I didn't buy anything anymore.<eos> So somehow I forgot about it.<eos> I just didn't want you to think...<eos> So I am giving it back right here.
Stay calm.<eos> Slave, keep the people back.<eos> Hold them, hold them.<eos> What did I say, ma'am?<eos> What did I tell you!<eos> Now calm, eh?<eos> Return her purse.<eos> Return it!<eos> Do you want me to kill you, filthy beast?<eos> Pick it up, ma'am.
Slave, keep the people back.<eos> Hold them, hold them.<eos> What did I say, ma'am?<eos> What did I tell you!<eos> Now calm, eh?<eos> Return her purse.<eos> Return it!<eos> Do you want me to kill you, filthy beast?<eos> Pick it up, ma'am.<eos> Don't be afraid to pick it up.
In that moment, I was incapable...<eos> -Don't play victim.<eos> Watch it.<eos> -I never saw the papers.<eos> De Rosa, give me form 415, come on.<eos> Sign this.<eos> You'll have to return the expenses for her maintenance.<eos> -I'll get it to you, don't worry.<eos> -Sign here.<eos> When I give my word, I keep it.
looking for the safe and the cash boxes. We re doing the best we can. explain that to him.<eos> He says, they looking for the safe and the cash boxes.<eos> - No, no, no. That s where I m going.<eos> You wait here.<eos> He won t give me the feed for the animals until he get paid. - well, keep talking. - I ve been talking, Matt.<eos> He's 'muy simpático , hes very sorry.<eos> But hes also got a family to feed. Keep conversing with him.<eos> We ve got the divers -coming up, maybe. -Sir...<eos> The Port Master said, with the deepest sympathy he s sorry but it is necessary that your ship be removed as soon as possible.<eos> I understand him, and I sympathize with him, and we II remove it as soon as possible. He says, he s very grateful...
Things are getting out of hand.<eos> Can you be more specific, General?<eos> We're all trying to make war more efficient.<eos> - That's our job.<eos> - And we're succeeding.<eos> We now have the capacity to blow up the whole world several times over.<eos> Which does not mean we must do it.<eos> We won't be able to stop from doing it.<eos> That's the logic of your position.<eos> We're setting up a war machine that acts faster... than the ability of men to control it.
I'm talking about the mortgage.<eos> You somehow managed to set it up on a base of 800,000 lire when you know, just as I do, that it's worth at least double that.<eos> Michele, you read too many books, you let your imagination get the better of you.<eos> No, it's the truth. This is why you've always advised Mother against selling the house.<eos> - Well, if that's how things are...<eos> - No, don't leave!<eos> - What do you expect me to do, stay here and be insulted?<eos> ! - Michele was just saying that...<eos> I know exactly what he was saying!<eos> To say that I had the house valued at half of what it should be, and that I'm now buying it for nothing it's likes saying that I'm...
Who do I race?<eos> The police.<eos> Some people I know need the best driver in the world.<eos> Johnny, don't send me away.<eos> I want you to mean this.<eos> I've always meant it. I want you.<eos> I'll fill you in on all the details if you can handle this job. Until I'm sure, you don't get word one.<eos> - That way, nobody gets hurt.<eos> - Suits me.<eos> The actual truck keeps a 25-mile speed all the time. I don't know whether it can keep it up on this side road.
They're dead tired.<eos> Well Varenov, thank you for your honesty.<eos> Now go and rest.<eos> Why do your torture yourself?<eos> Why do your torture yourself?<eos> You've done your bit.<eos> Be silent.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Peace is the banner of the weak.<eos> The strong raise it only to justify an offensive.
It was September 10th when he reached the street of Kyoto where his first wife used to live.<eos> It was midnight and the city was as silent as a cemetery.<eos> When did you come back to Kyoto?<eos> Now.<eos> Just now.<eos> How did you find your way to me, through all those black rooms?<eos> Stay seated.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> I'll get supper.<eos> I don't want it.
How is it going?<eos> A few more stitches.<eos> Why are you watching me so intently?<eos> I just remembered that night ten years ago.<eos> It's strange to recall it now after so many years.<eos> You're sewing with the light on your face and I'm looking up at you like this.<eos> That's why I remembered that night...<eos> What night?<eos> A strange thing happened that night.<eos> I can remember it well as if it happened yesterday.
I'm sorry if what goes on my heart is so conspicuous.<eos> You've heard.<eos> The head of the Praetorians, is not very fond of you.<eos> I don't blame him.<eos> Power always prevail.<eos> I should mention Sifface, that your scheme, to beat Maciste...<eos> - ... did not work.<eos> - I admire and admit Maciste's courage. But there's one thing that renders him invincible:<eos> luck!<eos> - It's true, and I ask the gods to keep blessing me, with it.
Meantime, I'm changing businesses.<eos> This is hot chestnut weather.<eos> Come along, children.<eos> - Bye, Bert. - Bye-bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye, Jane and Michael.<eos> No, I won't take your nasty medicine!<eos> Do we have to, Mary Poppins?<eos> People with wet feet must take their medicine.<eos> I don't want it.
Shook up and bumped up so you could get your rake off.<eos> All of the girls in this party have dysentery.<eos> That you cannot blame me for.<eos> I passed out mimeographed instructions:<eos> What to eat, what not to eat, what to drink, what not to drink.<eos> It's not what, but where we ate that gave us dysentery.<eos> It's not dysentery, not even amoebic.<eos> It's nothing...<eos> It's Montezuma's revenge.<eos> That's what we call it down here:
I don't care what anybody says.<eos> This fish is delicious.<eos> Swing it this way.<eos> I could handle another helping.<eos> And no funny stuff.<eos> Keep those dukes on the platter.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He says you're a hell of a man in action against a fish... ..if it's a dead fish.<eos> Very funny.<eos> Daddy always says the only difference between a success and a failure... ..is that a success knows an opportunity when he sees it, and a failure doesn't.
Cross it out.<eos> We don't need an introduction.<eos> This is to notify you that your daughter is in our possession.<eos> She is quite safe and if you follow instructions, she will remain safe.<eos> By this time, you will have informed the police.<eos> That was to be expected.<eos> But do not tell them about this letter des...<eos> Oh, full stop after letter.<eos> Do not tell them about this letter.<eos> Destroy it.
- Yes, absolutely.<eos> Shall I take her?<eos> No, you take care of those.<eos> - Are you sure she won't wake up?<eos> - She couldn't possibly.<eos> I've been thinking, what if the police haven't been by the time I get back?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, yes, that is something.<eos> Well, we'd better have a signal, then.<eos> I'll, er... I'll hang a shirt on the line and leave it there, until the police have been and gone.
They're you're closest relatives, Cathy.<eos> They're going to sell the house, my house!<eos> - Can they do that, Alex?<eos> Can they?<eos> - I'm afraid so.<eos> Your father's executors can sell.<eos> Of course the money is yours in trust.<eos> I don't want the money. I want the house.<eos> What would you do with it, Cathy?<eos> I'd visit it, look after it... guard it... and then when I'm old enough, I'd move back there.
And I'd never even heard of them before.<eos> They were always there, Cathy.<eos> I guess you can only see them in the dark.<eos> - I'd love you to see it before it's gone.<eos> - I've been there.<eos> Not really.<eos> Just to my father's office.<eos> The rest is so beautiful.<eos> I want to show you my house, Alex.<eos> I want to show it to you, just once before they sell it.
What about the other house?<eos> Oh, the one in Colchester.<eos> We didn't own it.<eos> I've never been there. It had nothing to do with me.<eos> My father said I wouldn't like it anyway.<eos> Just some mean trees, a hard bed and a bumpy road.<eos> Yes.<eos> But I can keep my house, Alex.<eos> And I can come and go as I please.<eos> We may rent it for a while, but only for a while.
What for?<eos> Where would you use the smoke grenade?<eos> Are they for your accomplices, to create confusion?<eos> Accomplices?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Simpson, you're aware next Tuesday is our annual Army Day parade?<eos> I swear on the life of my fa... of my mother.<eos> You know our chiefs of staff and the foreign military missions will be together on the grandstand?<eos> Their safety is our responsibility.<eos> We shall be merciless with anyone who threatens it. Merciless.
I can keep it all together.<eos> I do have my vision, and I can impose it with all my perfectionism and sense of order.<eos> I stick to what's relevant.<eos> I get things done the way I want them.<eos> My instrument obeys me... and not because I beat it into compliance.<eos> It obeys me of its own accord.<eos> And that's probably a good thing.<eos> So if I ask what the sign of a good director is for you, your answer would be the total vision.<eos> A director should manifest his total vision.<eos> Then, with the help of technical equipment, he conveys it to an audience.
We have a child.<eos> It has arms like this.<eos> And legs like this.<eos> How do you plan on getting it past the gate?<eos> - You can't get it from the kitchen.<eos> - How about from SS tailoring?<eos> Alfred?<eos> Look.<eos> Take a bottle of milk to SS tailoring tonight.<eos> Rudi will pick it up there.
How did you find out?<eos> It's in the afternoon papers.<eos> - I'm very sorry.<eos> - Uh, I pressed the bell, but it isn't ringing, I guess.<eos> I know.<eos> There's no electricity.<eos> Well, where did everything go?<eos> Charles sold it all at auction.<eos> This is all I have left.<eos> I love this room, but Charles never really saw it - only the things in it.
He was Greek!<eos> What will it matter when we're all one people?<eos> I am 52.<eos> He was 32 and failed.<eos> We will succeed.<eos> Your dreams, your ambitions.<eos> One lifetime is not enough for such dreams, such ambitions.<eos> The cloak of Alexander cannot be too heavy for Rome and Egypt to carry together.<eos> And what if his sword is too deeply embedded?<eos> Yours will replace it, Caesar.
And besides, with him, there's a double profit.<eos> The only thing that bothers me... is why I never thought of it before.<eos> There must be a little more honest way... to conduct a funeral business.<eos> I might expect that kind of talk from a criminal.<eos> Stop.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Having a little trouble, Mr. Gillie?<eos> This dirty lock was never made for picking.<eos> Then why don't you take an ax and chop it open?
Speak up.<eos> Everything seems to be in order.<eos> Bedtime. What?<eos> What's that?<eos> Trumbull?<eos> What are you doing on the floor?<eos> Drunk again?<eos> Not feeling well.<eos> What you need is a good dose of your own medicine.<eos> Keep it in your waistcoat, don't you?
Get your hands away!<eos> Get away!<eos> Hey!<eos> What the hell's going on there?<eos> Stop this nonsense!<eos> Get away!<eos> Turn the water off!<eos> Somewhere!<eos> In the stove, we keep fire burning always.<eos> The goons will not feel like moving it.
We thought perhaps we might talk it over.<eos> Why?<eos> It's only a two-man job.<eos> Everybody in the camp is supposed to clear all escape attempts in advance with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.<eos> We don't necessarily want to interfere.<eos> It's just that... well, what sort of blitz were you contemplating?<eos> We sneak out at night to a spot I found near the wire - a blind spot.<eos> Then we dig down, take the dirt, spread it on top so it won't make a pile, and then straight out.<eos> Ives here is a tunnel man, so he digs in front, pushes the dirt behind him.<eos> I stash it behind me, then we burrow through the dirt like a couple of moles.
Hilts, this may not be quite the right time for this sort of thing.<eos> Look, sir, I've been in the bag nearly three years now, bloody close to being wire-happy.<eos> It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.<eos> It'll work.<eos> I know it will.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hilts, um... how do you breathe?<eos> - We got a steel rod with hinges on it.<eos> We shove it up and make air holes as we go along.
- Lovely.<eos> What do you call this?<eos> The Purple Parlor.<eos> We're going to use this as the operating room.<eos> I mean the center of operations.<eos> - It's not very cheerful.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> There's nothing more cozy than an old gargoyle... except maybe a whipping post or two.<eos> This house does have its little oddities.<eos> The man who built it was a misfit... who hated people and their conventional ideas.
His daughter, Abigail.<eos> - Now the dog...<eos> - The dog you were chasing last night.<eos> Yeah, very good.<eos> Now that one, she's got to be the companion.<eos> The one who's supposed to have murdered Abigail.<eos> No, that was much later. When Abigail was an old lady.<eos> I wonder how this statue got here.<eos> It wasn't on the original inventory.<eos> Maybe I'll break it up and sell it for tombstones.
I can't afford it.<eos> You sure weren't riding the range this afternoon.<eos> - I sure wasn't.<eos> - No.<eos> I wish I knew where some girls get the time.<eos> By the time I finish scrubbing the floor, cleaning the bathtub, hanging clothes...<eos> - They just drop everything, honey.<eos> - I suppose it does beat housework.<eos> - Want an orange?<eos> I'll peel it for you.
Stick with me. Your jeans'll be full of change.<eos> How come?<eos> Well, I'll tell you.<eos> Put on a clean white shirt and saw a lawyer.<eos> There's a law that says when old folks can't cut the mustard any more, you can make 'em let go, whether they like it or not.<eos> What are you pulling on Granddad now?<eos> Something pretty raw, kid.<eos> Yeah, it sounds like it.<eos> Take your dough.<eos> I don't want it.
I'd take her any time.<eos> Oh, you would?<eos> - It was just a joke, Hippolyte.<eos> - A joke?<eos> So how come nobody's laughing?<eos> Now go back to work.<eos> Ox.<eos> And so it was one big, happy family around here..<eos> The "macs", the "poules" and the "flics" or as you would say, the cops.<eos> Your statesmen and politicians keep talking about peaceful coexistence but here, in our milieu, we really practise it.
Please, go and stop it.<eos> Stamp on it or something.<eos> - You know I hate explosions.<eos> - It's perfectly all right. I just want to blow a small hole in the wall, then we'll be out of here.<eos> Something's happened to the fuse.<eos> - What could possibly...<eos> - Hold it. Sh!<eos> Listen.<eos> The fuse has gone out.<eos> I can't hear it anymore.
- Favor Piggy as you always do.<eos> -Jack!<eos> -Jack! Jack!<eos> - You're breaking the rules!<eos> - Who cares?<eos> Because the rules are the only thing we've got.<eos> Bullocks to the rules!<eos> We're strong.<eos> We hunt.<eos> If there's a beast, we'll hunt it down!
You're so beautiful, Virginia, I like you more than before!<eos> But I hate you more than before, don Egidio, and you know it!<eos> - We're here, Pasquale, we're here!<eos> - Mamozio!<eos> - Pasquale!<eos> - Mamozio!<eos> get me down, quickly.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Give me the club!<eos> God gave it to me, awe on who touches it.
It is! It's Sir Charles!<eos> Tucker!<eos> - Inspector!<eos> - Tucker!<eos> Inspector!<eos> Take your filthy hands off my asp.<eos> - Charles?<eos> - Where's the safe?<eos> In the library.<eos> George is robbing it.
Happy birthday, old grump.<eos> Didn't he like the gift?<eos> -You never know with him.<eos> What do you want?<eos> -I'm bringing some towels.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> -My wife already said that.<eos> And what did she give me?<eos> A forest.<eos> Where shall we put it?
-What do you mean? Why is it too late?<eos> -Someone makes it impossible.<eos> I said you couldn't marry her yet, but I'm not a monster.<eos> Welcome to our place. We don't see you often enough.<eos> You're not marrying yet.<eos> Later, but with someone... Know what I mean?<eos> Not really.<eos> -Your room's ready.<eos> It's just been repainted..<eos> If you don't like it, we'll do it again.
So you're a 140 I.Q. journalist.<eos> - Where's your typewriter?<eos> - Easy, Lloyd.<eos> The last reporter I had on this floor was Ben Franklin.<eos> - And that egghead gave me more trouble than -<eos> - Come on, Mr. Barrett.<eos> Born phonies, all you newspapermen.<eos> You came at the make-friends hour.<eos> Patients who behave are permitted to congregate in this corridor.<eos> They call it "the street".
Everyone has a right to that water, you can't take it away.<eos> The water's mine, my friend.<eos> Who says it's yours?<eos> Where's it written?<eos> I've got the deeds to that land.<eos> Don't kid around.<eos> That water supply's as old as Adam, no one can lay claim to it.<eos> What's Adam got to do with it?<eos> Stop being a know-it-all.<eos> Water's the earth's blood, you can't cut it off.
If you don't get organised, you're not men.<eos> I've warned you, now do what you want.<eos> Agha, I'm not happy about this, we've no right to cut off the water.<eos> Look here!<eos> How many times must I tell you?<eos> Our land needs water.<eos> Why shouldn't I use my own?<eos> Where's the spring?<eos> On our land.<eos> So I'll make use of it first.
Don't worry.<eos> I'll write to him, and he'll answer.<eos> We'll go and see him when the harvest's over.<eos> What you're doing is terrible, shame on you!<eos> You've got no principles, no pity!<eos> You've no right to open these channels, not for free!<eos> This is my water, I'm not giving you any.<eos> You can do without, your crops can wither!<eos> God damn you, you villains!<eos> We didn't open anything, but if the water's running, we'll use it.
You've abandoned him, and he went to jail for you.<eos> I'm not having fun.<eos> I work all day long.<eos> I know you work hard, but you should keep in touch.<eos> But he doesn't keep in touch either.<eos> He could write to us.<eos> It's not right to expect something from a man in prison.<eos> OK, shut up.<eos> I'll go into town tomorrow.<eos> If there's a letter, I'll bring it.
We've never managed to come up with an answer.<eos> Sure.<eos> We're ignorant, uneducated, incapable.<eos> I've got the answer, let's see what you think.<eos> We'll buy Osman's water.<eos> It's not a bad idea.<eos> We'll have to pay for God's water.<eos> - It's no right.<eos> - There's no other way.<eos> What if he won't sell it to us?
I can taste it.<eos> If I hadn 't been trained to save the lives of my men , trained like Pavlov's dogs, I would never have told those bastard Ebonites a thing.<eos> Training always tells, General.<eos> I'm an old friend of the family. I owe it to them to see you don 't break their hearts.<eos> My father's heart is already broken and my mother's is unbreakable.<eos> Terry.<eos> (interrogator) General!<eos> Here's the interrogator.<eos> He's not unlike we Earth types.<eos> He demands a great deal of cooperation and raises the dickens if he doesn 't get it.
What terrible thing have you done, you rotten old man ?<eos> Bring him back.<eos> Please, sir.<eos> Bring him back to me the way he was.<eos> My Gwyllm.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> The whole town must be utterly destroyed.<eos> An example must be made.<eos> You're wrong!<eos> The human race has a gift, Professor, a gift that sets it above all the other creatures that abound upon this planet.
I'm having your car parked in the stable behind the building, sir.<eos> The general is waiting for you, professor graves.<eos> Anything on the screen over there?<eos> No, nothing yet.<eos> I'll be at my desk if you want anything. I'll put this on yours.<eos> Steven!<eos> Well, you're 24 hours late. I know.<eos> I would've been here 2 days ago.<eos> I was all briefed and ready to leave washington when, uh... some 5-star personality decided maybe this invasion ought to be covered by a commissioned officer. Ahh.<eos> I told him commissioned officers make history, musty young professors record it.
This is us, morgue, california.<eos> Any danger of tourists bouncing in?<eos> Morgue never has been a tourist spot.<eos> Anyway, here, here, here, here, here, and here are our patrol spots, making a complete circle, a periphery... surrounding the area in which we're allowing the zantis to come down in.<eos> The sentries are armed. They have orders to kill.<eos> That means that we're determined to keep strays from stumbling into the zanti area, accidentally or otherwise.<eos> It also means that we're determined to keep the zantis inside this circle.<eos> Suppose they decide not to land where we've, uh... offered to let them land.<eos> A missile base here.<eos> If that penal ship is more than 10 degrees off target, we destroy it.
Get in touch with my pilot and tell him.<eos> Right.<eos> And find out when we can get out of this place. Right.<eos> Now, the creature seems to be mainly aquatic, but i would say it has reached a stage of evolution where it can live on land for short periods of time.<eos> But notice what you might call the fingers.<eos> It is a wonder mr. Dexter was not torn to shreds.<eos> My spear was in its shoulder.<eos> Well, there is no sign of a wound.<eos> I want a man watching this thing at all times.<eos> No one is to move it.
As you can see, just a sip.<eos> We'll use this and some sea water to make miso soup.<eos> It doesn't taste good if made with sea water alone.<eos> It's too salty to eat!<eos> We'll only get thirsty!<eos> Sip it slowly.<eos> Don't taste it, swallow it straight away.<eos> Gorosuke, be strong!<eos> Believe it!<eos> We must believe we'll make it!
- What?<eos> Mitya, tell me the truth. Am I stupid?<eos> What?<eos> Well... I'm mean, I'm...<eos> Lyolya, why all this?<eos> - Why don't you eat?<eos> - I'm not hungry.<eos> You must eat.<eos> Where did you get this frock?<eos> I've been wearing it every day for a month now.
This news concerns us all.<eos> Our troops are not coming.<eos> Why, Leonidas?<eos> The council made a secret decision to fortify the isthmus of Corinth, and not to go beyond it.<eos> - Then we cannot stay here!<eos> - We can. And we must.<eos> We've received no orders to leave.<eos> And we have our duty to Greece.<eos> Greeks followed us because they believed in our word.<eos> We are not going to break it.
Recognize the senior senator from Michigan.<eos> The senior senator from South Carolina... has just eaten a rather large order of crow.<eos> Strangely enough, he makes the dish seem palatable. He makes us all want to sit at his table.<eos> He calls himself a curmudgeon.<eos> Well, I hope the day never comes... when there is not at least one curmudgeon in this body... to goad us in the right direction.<eos> I can't agree with him about Mr. Leffingwell.<eos> I don't interpret Mr. Leffingwell in the same way.<eos> I don't hear an alien voice.<eos> To me, it sounds realistic. And more than that... I have great respect for the judgment of our chief executive.<eos> I'll vote for the nominee. But there are tragic circumstances surrounding this nomination... which takes it out of the usual business and sets it deeply... into the conscience of each senator.
- Right away.<eos> - Look over there.<eos> A jellyfish.<eos> - What?<eos> - Look.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> There, you see it?<eos> I don't see it.<eos> Look down at the bottom.<eos> Ah, yes, now I see it.
Why not?<eos> Why, don't you know?<eos> Come on, smart guy, yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Come, I'll tell you.<eos> Ah!<eos> Uh!<eos> They have eaten the watermelon.<eos> Come see.<eos> They have eaten it, but they didn't call us.
So how come you decided to come with me to the beach?<eos> Well, to the beach or wherever.<eos> To spend some time together, why?<eos> Well, this morning before you were busy... you seemed less romantic.<eos> Well, perhaps it's for the best.<eos> One never knows with you!<eos> What are you doing, leaving the car here like this?<eos> I can't be bothered to park it.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, give me the keys and I'll park it for you.
- Well, now what do you want?<eos> - That box you're sittin' on.<eos> - That's tough.<eos> - It's just an apple box.<eos> - You could get another.<eos> - I could. - Well?<eos> - But I ain't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I ain't so inclined.<eos> All right, I'll buy it off you.
I'm doin' 25.<eos> I'll get grey-headed.<eos> - What do I have to live for?<eos> - You just lie quiet. I'm fed up with this life.<eos> You don't know what I'm goin' through, old man.<eos> I'm sick of it.<eos> I hope to God I do die.<eos> Never had a real good day all my life.<eos> Life.<eos> Who needs it?
I have discovered...<eos> Follow me.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You. And your soul.<eos> I'm in love.<eos> Oh God...<eos> And the devil.<eos> It's all the same thing.<eos> I was never taught how to pray...<eos> If I want a thing, I take it.
Answer me!<eos> Are you really standing around me?<eos> I don't think you like a girl like me.<eos> I can't see through you, you God!<eos> Yet, I can't help by pray you.<eos> That I may today sell this story.<eos> We don't usually buy children's stories by unknown writer.<eos> But this is my best work.<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> Leave it here anyway.
So long as the Arabs fight tribe against tribe so long will they be a little people a silly people.<eos> Greedy, barbarous and cruel, as you are.<eos> Come.<eos> I will take you to Feisal.<eos> I do not want your company, sherif.<eos> Wadi Safra is another day from here.<eos> You will not find it, and you will die.<eos> I will find it with this.<eos> Good army compass.<eos> How if I take it?
I wouldn't care if your maternal grandfather turned out to be a Turk.<eos> But if I ever found out that you didn't believe in God I think I would commit suicide.<eos> A gun!<eos> It belonged to Mr. Haze.<eos> You should be careful with those things.<eos> It's not loaded.<eos> That's what they all say, "I didn't know it was loaded. "<eos> This is a sacred weapon.<eos> It's a tragic treasure.<eos> Mr. Haze purchased it when he found out he was ill.
Well, anyhow, I think we've lost him.<eos> I told you not to drive so fast!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> - Don't talk to me that way.<eos> - Do you think I wanted to have a blow out?<eos> Hey, look, all the nines changed to the next thousand.<eos> There it is.<eos> What?<eos> The car.<eos> Don't you recognize it now?
Good luck.<eos> You too.<eos> Who was that guy?<eos> The one you was talking to so long?<eos> I don't know, Sparrow.<eos> I never saw him before in my life.<eos> Happy birthday, General... from your staff!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will you cut the cake, sir?<eos> I trust you don't expect me to eat it, too!
The Hash outfit just arrived.<eos> Burn eight.<eos> - Not too close to the ocotillo bush.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> "Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law."<eos> You're a persistent cuss, pilgrim.<eos> You really aim to hang that up outside?<eos> - That's why I painted it.<eos> - Take some advice, pilgrim.<eos> You put that thing up, you'll have to defend it with a gun, and you ain't exactly the type.
No evasions, Mr. Secretary.<eos> No evasions, if you please, sir.<eos> Evasions?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> What kind of foolishness is this?<eos> Mr. Secretary, I'm kinda new at this job, but I don't think it's good public relations to talk that way to a United States senator, even if he is an idiot.<eos> I am United States Senator John Yerkes Iselin, and I have here a list of the names of 207 persons who are known by the secretary of defense as being members of the Communist party!<eos> - What?<eos> - And who are still, nevertheless...<eos> If you have such a list, bring it up here!
Well, we are at war.<eos> It's a cold war, but it will get worse and worse until every man, woman and child in this country will have to stand up and be counted and say whether they are on the side of right and freedom<eos> I will go with you to Washington. Tomorrow, if you like.<eos> And I will show you documented proof that this man stands for evil, that he is evil and that his whole life was devoted to undermining everything that you and I and Johnny and every freedom-minded American...<eos> She won, of course.<eos> She always does.<eos> I could never beat her.<eos> I still can't.<eos> I wrote a letter.<eos> Or she wrote it and I signed it. I-I can't even remember which.
This kind of psychopath kills for the pleasure it gives him... to see the agony of his victims.<eos> That's why the poor girl was raped.<eos> The crime is connected to this act.<eos> Are they conscious of their behavior?<eos> They know very well what they're doing, I'm sure.<eos> When they're no longer in crisis, they seem completely normal... even agreeable and friendly.<eos> Like you, for example, Mr. Kallman?<eos> That's right. Or like yourself, sir.<eos> I see.<eos> But knowing the area like I know it... it's not around here that the right trail is found.
She's strong enough.<eos> Miss Annie.<eos> Yes?<eos> Where would you take Helen?<eos> Well...<eos> - Italy?<eos> - What?<eos> Can't have everything.<eos> How would your little house do?<eos> Bring Helen there after a long ride so she won't recognise it.
Like this?<eos> But imagine, Sam, imagine hearing Puccini's music over a shot of Fujiyama, over those beautiful shrines, over a face like that,<eos> Yes, lt'll be fabulous,<eos> Oh, brother, I got to stop eating,<eos> My stomach's busting, and my knees are killing me,<eos> Paul, can't we leave now?<eos> Look, Bob, we ought to stay another five minutes, just as a matter of courtesy,<eos> Okay,<eos> By the way, Paul, I expect the music tomorrow morning,<eos> I want you to listen to it,
I would accept to play my part, and, playing the part of the engineer Alberto Ballarini,<eos> I would also be jealous of my wife.<eos> It is the role play, Zannini.<eos> If I accept the role, I have to play out.<eos> Full-fledged husband, or nothing.<eos> Think about it.<eos> - Think about it.<eos> No, no, think about it yourselves.<eos> And give me an answer.<eos> The answer, they haven't given it yet, and I don't know if they'll give it now.
You've heard, Fido dear?<eos> Don't worry, no photographers.<eos> That's why you go out through here.<eos> Thanks, boss.<eos> Fido!<eos> I knew you'd come!<eos> My big beautiful dog, dear, dear.<eos> Thanks, boss. - Don't mention it!<eos> Fido, let's go, come!<eos> And the suitcase, don't you take it?
Hi, professor!<eos> -It's Moe!<eos> Moe's driving it!<eos> -Come back here!<eos> Look out, professor!<eos> Shut her down, you bubblebrain.<eos> Well, professor, perhaps your machine isn't quite ready yet.<eos> Oh, yes, it is, sir.<eos> Besides, I want you people to have it...<eos> -...before the Martians get it.
Moe's driving it!<eos> -Come back here!<eos> Look out, professor!<eos> Shut her down, you bubblebrain.<eos> Well, professor, perhaps your machine isn't quite ready yet.<eos> Oh, yes, it is, sir.<eos> Besides, I want you people to have it...<eos> -...before the Martians get it.<eos> -What did you say?<eos> -The Martians, they want it.
-What are you stopping for?<eos> -I didn't stop it.<eos> It's the engines.<eos> Well, come on, we got a repair job to do.<eos> You are about to witness a test of the Navy's new atomic depth charge which has been placed at the base of this tower.<eos> This is the bomb.<eos> Powerful enough to destroy every enemy submarine within a radius of 6 miles.<eos> And utterly devastate an equal area on land.<eos> The bomb is adjusted to maximum sensitivity.<eos> The slightest contact with moisture will set it off.
Automobile Exchange Company.<eos> See, it's a rebuilt carburetor.<eos> AEC is Atomic Energy Commission.<eos> That's the bomb!<eos> A bomb!<eos> Oh, Moe!<eos> Moe, what are we gonna do?<eos> What do you usually do when somebody mails you a bomb?<eos> I mail it back.<eos> You birdbrain, you dunk it in water and put it out of commission.
Besides, that's not the point.<eos> The point is I'm not her.<eos> She would have fitted in.<eos> That's really the subject, Jerry. Not you and me. You and her.<eos> And that's been the subject since the first minute we met.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What's Jake?<eos> A piece of penny candy.<eos> If you've got a penny and you're near a machine, you put it in.
Yes, how your particular delusion is described, in the writings which preface the law.<eos> Before the law there stands a guard.<eos> A man comes from the country seeking admittance to the law.<eos> But the guard cannot admit him.<eos> Can the man hope to enter at a later time?<eos> I've heard it before, we've all heard it.<eos> The man is dying of old age still waiting there.<eos> And just at the end the guard tells him that the... door was meant for him, only for him.<eos> The guard tells him no one could enter this door.<eos> "And now, I'm going to close it."
So any trouble will fall on me.<eos> I'll want the racists to talk like racists.<eos> For a film on robbery I'd ask someone to steal even if it's a fake theft, but I'd be an accomplice even if I'm filming.<eos> So it's an amateur movie?<eos> Why?<eos> Amateur or professional films don't exist.<eos> It's not a pro film because you don't know whether we can do it or not.<eos> It's an experiment.<eos> Mr. Rouch, is the scenario already written?<eos> No, we'll write it with your white classmates.
- You said you changed.<eos> - From top to bottom.<eos> - You swear?<eos> - I swear!<eos> - Give me 300 pounds.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Since when I entered, I smell a stink ...<eos> It's true, I have not told you anything because I am polite, but when you entered, I felt it too.
I've never been in any bedroom with you.<eos> You don't want to remember... because you're afraid.<eos> And you don't recognize this photo either?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I don't know. I don't remember.<eos> You know who took it.<eos> You're lying.<eos> It was last year.<eos> I had to insist on taking it.
Yes, the other day I sent a letter to our comrades on the Town Council.<eos> - Yes, indeed.<eos> I have a copy of the masterpiece here.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> We have the chance to pull off a marvelous bit of propaganda and even exploit it nationally and what do you do?<eos> You write to our comrades telling them not to be inflexible to close one eye, and stop the work.<eos> No, I was merely adapting to the climate of détente...<eos> And just what do you think détente means?<eos> Dropping your pants in front of the priests?<eos> We offer détente, we do not subject ourselves to it.
Now, it's my turn.<eos> Let's leave with the first train.<eos> Tomorrow, wait for me at the foot of the hill.<eos> Just before dawn.<eos> Get ready before your father's return.<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> Dad!<eos> Sadako, Takashi won't come.<eos> Rikizo gave me this letter for you.<eos> Takashi left it before going away.
Spyro!<eos> Detonators, sir, please.<eos> I'll be finished here in about 30 seconds.<eos> Miller?<eos> Miller!<eos> Yes, what is it?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> They'll search those guns first and find my stuff.<eos> They're not stupid.<eos> But if they remove it carelessly, they could have the same result.
- Only three.<eos> They're taking out casks.<eos> They must be going for water.<eos> We can take them, Captain.<eos> And bring all the rest of them ashore?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> We'll sit this one out quietly.<eos> - What are they doing now?<eos> - They're going towards the boat.<eos> - Do you think they'll find it?
- It's Friday.<eos> - Alright!<eos> I'll give you a morsel.<eos> - No, thank you!<eos> I want to respect it.<eos> - Alright!<eos> Give him the cutlet, and you'll eat the omelet from this morning.<eos> You like stale food anyway.<eos> No, give it to him!<eos> It's him who wants to respect it.
- Sure, and when will we eat?<eos> - Is it my fault if... .. I've been left all alone?<eos> If poor Anita was still alive.<eos> No, you drove Anita to her death by forcing her to... .. eat your stale food!<eos> And now you're trying it with me!<eos> No, in my house there's no stale food.<eos> Sure, with he hunger you're showing!<eos> Here's Aga Khan talking!<eos> Who took the key from here?<eos> What do I know, you hide it all the time!
It's done.<eos> But there's no fireplace!<eos> Oh, you also like fireplaces?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> - They provide intimacy, warmth, true?<eos> - Of course!<eos> - Come in.<eos> I had a house with a fireplace, but this is not mine.<eos> Mine are the prints, the books, the disks.<eos> I rent a house for three, four months, then I leave it.

All tests amount to nothing and make no sense.<eos> Everything is fragmented, broken.<eos> If it was a catastrophe that changed everything so senselessly, then it must have been a disaster of unimaginable dimensions.<eos> We can only figure it out if we systematically continue our research.<eos> Here, the white sphere, where the various power cables originate seems to be a giant transformer.<eos> Something like a magnetic power plant.<eos> It's odd though, that there is sporadic voltage in the main power line.<eos> It's as if someone is sitting at the other end, and doesn't realize that the generator isn't working. But he still keeps trying to activate it.<eos> What should we do?<eos> We'll explore the main line and follow it to the other end.
- Do you realize if this ever leaked out...<eos> - It won't!<eos> Believe me.<eos> Never again.<eos> Nobody is gonna use my apartment from now on.<eos> - Where is your apartment?<eos> - West 67th Street.<eos> You have no idea what I go through with the neighbors, the landlady and the key.<eos> How do you work it with the key?<eos> I slip it to 'em in the office and they leave it under a mat.
Yes, Baxter.<eos> Just how serious is it?<eos> It was touch and go there for a while, but she's sleeping it off now.<eos> I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> You'll have to handle the situation yourself, Baxter.<eos> - As a matter of fact, I'm counting on you.<eos> - Yes, sir. I understand.<eos> She left a letter.<eos> Would you like me to open it and read it to you?
That anybody'd think a girl like you would do a thing like this over a guy like me.<eos> Did you find something here?<eos> An envelope?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've got it.<eos> Don't you think we'd better destroy it so it won't fall in the wrong hands?<eos> Open it.<eos> There's nothing here but a $100 bill.<eos> That's right.<eos> Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Fella!<eos> Fella!<eos> - Fella!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Oh!<eos> Fella!<eos> Fella!<eos> Yes, Stepmother.<eos> Where's my car? Oh, I'll...<eos> I'll drive it right around to the front door.
- What's the matter?<eos> What's the matter? "Why did George F Babbitt underwrite a guarantee of $30,000 to bring a revival to Zenith?"<eos> "Is Sister Sharon preaching the word of Jesus or the gospel of Babbitt's real-estate business?"<eos> For God's sakes!<eos> I don't want any trouble.<eos> I am in business.<eos> I'm a 32nd-degree Mason.<eos> George boy, don't take this thing so seriously!<eos> - I just sure as hell don't think it's a joke!<eos> - We'll lick it, Georgie!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?<eos> I want to know now.<eos> Don't be fools!<eos> You'll turn our village into a graveyard.<eos> Tell them to go.<eos> It's the only thing for them to do.<eos> I'll tell you what I can do.<eos> I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.<eos> The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!<eos> We started this fight, and we're gonna finish it!
I have the duty to inform you of some details of the will , a certain Bernardo Saints of Parerga.<eos> I would spare me the posthumous complications caused by unbearable individual.<eos> But I can not help it doctor.<eos> She is the only one of all the men who refused the woman richest in the world and has thus inherited a fortune ى left for this purpose by the late Mr. Parerga.<eos> I'm sick and sick, I am sick and tired<eos> I Do not want to be the victim of the whims of involuntary Parerga understand?<eos> But dear doctor is my duty to inform you that the 28 companies pharmaceutical associated Parerga pass now under its control.<eos> The weeping ladies, go to hell with his old billionaire nuisance, s ى go to hell!<eos> I prefer to sell... prefer to sell what is written in these notes burdensome than accept an annuity, an annuity burdensome as that she offers me.<eos> A new medical discovery we buy it immediately.
- Yes.<eos> - Knowing that you must lose?<eos> Knowing we can.<eos> All men lose when they die and all men die.<eos> But a slave and a free man lose different things.<eos> They both lose life.<eos> When a free man dies, he loses the pleasure of life.<eos> A slave loses his pain.<eos> Death is the only freedom a slave knows.<eos> That's why he's not afraid of it.
I intend taking a journey into the future.<eos> Or perhaps the doctor would volunteer to go?<eos> Well, look here, George suppose you do go off to the 50th century how will you get back?<eos> Now, look here, George.<eos> I don't know what you think, but we're not fools!<eos> We're practical businessmen.<eos> What I want to ask you is this:<eos> Even if you had invented a time machine, what of it?<eos> What's its use?<eos> Who'd buy it?
Women are perfect and you are the most perfect woman of them all.<eos> From perfect wife to perfect mistress and back to perfect wife.<eos> And all within a few hours.<eos> Will you have the goodness to take me home?<eos> Certainly.<eos> Your home or my home?<eos> My home.<eos> Seems to me, my dear, our long affair is wearing a little thin.<eos> Yes, it does, doesn't it?<eos> Perhaps we should terminate it before it becomes completely ashes.
Is it you?<eos> Yes.<eos> - You're sure making yourself at home!<eos> - Why not, you're a sight.<eos> - Idiot...<eos> - Call me an idiot!<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Give it to me, take the negligee.<eos> You look better without.<eos> Be nice, don't put it on, I want to see you again.
Did the rosary help?<eos> She was able to tell me, in detail, what had happened.<eos> All right, go on from there.<eos> Now, what did you do then?<eos> I had her lie on the bed and I got some cold cloths for her head.<eos> I gave her a drink of brandy.<eos> After a while, she became calm and seemed to go to sleep.<eos> Then I went to the closet, I got my gun and I loaded it.<eos> - Was it in your mind to kill Barney Quill?<eos> Then why did you go to the closet and get your gun and load it?
Wow!<eos> - You've done it again the trick?<eos> - So they've denounced you?<eos> - No, I paid.<eos> - Who gave you the money?<eos> I found the receipt in Peppe pants.<eos> I could not resist the temptation he took the suitcase and I took 10,000 lire.<eos> But... where did you put the suitcase ?<eos> !<eos> I took it with me.
One can not even take a lunch, and there comes the Marshal!<eos> - Then they say that there is freedom!<eos> - We're not doing the "poems"!<eos> The imperative of the moment is to take away the suitcase!<eos> If they find it here, we wll all end up in!<eos> We can not turn with that suitcase in the hospital!<eos> - The marshal is waiting down!<eos> - I know!<eos> You wait outside the hospital, under the wall.<eos> I throw the suitcase to Ugo and Ugo hands it to you.
Go on, recite it to me.<eos> Never!<eos> Are you really so silly, then?<eos> On this point, a real idiot, Florence.<eos> I can already hear Paul saying,<eos> "So you're a poet, are you?<eos> Writing verse in secret!"<eos> Paul's not here.<eos> Recite your poem to me.<eos> I'll think it for you, but I won't say it.
She won't sign.<eos> - Neither will I ask her to.<eos> - I expected this. I congratulate you.<eos> I need loyal and faithful men.<eos> But if she agrees, you would do your country a great service.<eos> I would help her to escape to a foreign place safe and sound.<eos> I'll show you something.<eos> With this, I know that you will collaborate.<eos> I ignored this declaration made by García.<eos> Gual sent it to the vice-president, but we blocked it.
I'll explain why later.<eos> This is... It should be... A Morton safe, type 37-A.<eos> I don't get it. What's this Morton 37-A all about?<eos> Listen carefully, I don't like repeating myself.<eos> I sent the jam jars under the name of Giuseppe Esposito... Got it?<eos> -Perfectly, and who is Giuseppe Esposito?<eos> Stupid...<eos> The merchandise is already in the safe waiting for Giuseppe Esposito to collect it.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I'll wait a few days... Then I'll steal it.
Tell the men...<eos> I think I'd like to be alone.<eos> Listen to this.<eos> "The president announced a practice air raid alert to affect the entire East Coast.<eos> Ships will be forbidden entry until it's over."<eos> - When does it start?<eos> - In less than an hour.<eos> New York deserted. Should be a sight.<eos> Is it because of the new bomb?<eos> The Q-bomb, they call it.
I brought you here 'cause I trust you.<eos> Me?<eos> Careful he doesn't steal your grenade.<eos> But I don't have -<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> - How'd you know?<eos> - I can feel it.<eos> I really thought I'd lost it.<eos> I know.<eos> I used to keep it in my pocket.
When this shelling stops... you and your outfit take over this whole right sector.<eos> You'll have to get up there fast.<eos> They won't give you much time.<eos> I just flat don't get it.<eos> Back at the rear they think this fight's won.<eos> - This hill worth it?<eos> - I wondered when you'd ask me that.<eos> Worth what?<eos> It hasn't much military value.<eos> I doubt if any American'd give you a dollar for it.
Apologies, please come in.<eos> My Jacket!<eos> Nothing, please come in.<eos> Here's mom.<eos> - Ah, the mom.<eos> My pleasure, madam.<eos> He called me "madam"!<eos> Why, what should I call her?<eos> Are the flowers for me? Did you see your jacket?<eos> I've seen it, I've seen it!
Meet me in an hour at Place Pigalle.<eos> - Okay.<eos> It's my uncle's old printing plant.<eos> The machines were so heavy, the floor caved in.<eos> Think it might cave in some more?<eos> No, it already hit bottom.<eos> Here's your mattress, and this'll be your pillow.<eos> Damn, it's heavy!<eos> You can just walk around until midnight.<eos> Keep my briefcase for me. Give it back to me tomorrow.
Anything happen when Burdette left?<eos> Nice as pie. Didn't say a word.<eos> What was the shot when they came in?<eos> That gunslinger of his was on the prod.<eos> What'd he do?<eos> Nothing, just grunted and growled, made a few faces.<eos> Took care of that.<eos> What happened here?<eos> Not much.<eos> That tune, they been playing it all day.
What'd he have to say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You mean, he didn't say anything?<eos> Why are you so interested?<eos> Because he's talking now.<eos> Hear that music?<eos> He told the man to play it.<eos> What is it?<eos> They call it the Deguello, the cutthroat song.<eos> The Mexicans played it for those Texas boys when they had 'em bottled up in the Alamo.

- You lie.<eos> - You were always a weaver of words.<eos> - You accuse him falsely.<eos> After you've chosen him over me?<eos> Theirs should be the choice.<eos> - Let them choose.<eos> - Aye, hear us.<eos> - You, the elders, what say you?<eos> - Accept the will of God.<eos> - The crown is mine. I shall fight for it.
I did it to test you.<eos> - But I didn't want to come up!<eos> - Yet here you are!<eos> - You kept on insisting!<eos> - You should have resisted!<eos> A good woman shouldn't visit the bedroom of a man even if he picks her up and carries her there!<eos> - But, we're engaged.<eos> - Not anymore!<eos> - And your mother's letter?<eos> - Never mention it again!
It's as if my life began and ended that night.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> At the ball...<eos> I was taken there by some boy who got too drunk to stand.<eos> I wanted to leave.<eos> My coat was in the cloakroom.<eos> They couldn't find the check for it, so I said, "Let it go" and started out for a taxi.<eos> Then somebody took my arm and said:<eos> "I'll drive you home."<eos> As we left, he took off his coat and put it around my shoulders and then I looked at him.
And I protest it formally.<eos> I want you men to remember that for the record.<eos> That as an officer I protested any such act.<eos> Give your orders.<eos> Lead them out and turn them loose.<eos> If this don't work, this is the last order you're ever going to give.<eos> Move.<eos> - How many miles you figure to base?<eos> - Forty, more or less.<eos> If my calculations are right we ought to hit the Tex-Mex railroad tomorrow afternoon then follow it right on into base.
That it's strong enough to shatter the spinal column, we know.<eos> But what it is... what causes it to appear and disappear, we don't know.<eos> Some day I hope to find out.<eos> Maybe it's what makes your spine tingle when you're scared.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Tingle?<eos> It can do a great deal more than that.<eos> It's odd.<eos> I've been experimenting with this force for years. Never had a name for it until now.<eos> Now I think I'll call it "The Tingler."
Don't worry about that now.<eos> Numbers get replaced by letters.<eos> Why?<eos> It's just how it is.<eos> It's easier.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Math is really stupid.<eos> You're always doing the opposite.<eos> To divide, you have to multiply.<eos> They teach us one thing and then change it.
- Yes.<eos> - Come on, it's a surprise.<eos> I ruined myself, I also bought the upper terrace!<eos> Ah, there will be the room for our kids!<eos> Do not start again about the children.<eos> For time being, no, so we said.<eos> Yes, we said, but I want children, dear.<eos> I also want them!<eos> But now let's just be alone!<eos> This door goes to the main ladder, we close it and we are alone.
He has slept 2 years at my house, 2 years at our brother Otello and now where is he sleeping?<eos> Where he sleeps, Albe?<eos> Where is he sleeping?<eos> I'm just married, I need intimacy!<eos> - Yes, yes...<eos> - Yes, yes!<eos> You have 3 terraces, front, behind and one above, that is just superfluous! And I put him on the terrace, uncle?<eos> You build a room and make him sleep, poor old one!<eos> This poor old man is your mom's brother!<eos> It is my mother's brother, I love him dearly and the terrace will be superfluous but nobody touches it!
And where is it now?<eos> It was working for a pier on the Po river, but it fell into the water and remained at the bottom of the river.<eos> Did you understand?<eos> How they take advantage of her, huh?<eos> A single, helpless woman, a gentle soul...<eos> If you knew how many concerns gave me this car, before it began to lose its oil, then he killed my husband and is now in the water.<eos> So let's catch it!<eos> Let's go there, we pull it and we bring it here.<eos> And then?<eos> You put it in our hands and you will enter in company with us.
She'll know if it ever happened to one of us before.<eos> But whether it has or not, Shep, I can call you Shep now, can't I?<eos> - And you must call me Auntie.<eos> - Let me get this straight.<eos> - You mean you think you're one, too?<eos> - Yes, Shep.<eos> How else could I get into your apartment when the door was locked?<eos> Oh, very true.<eos> That door's locked.<eos> Let's watch you open it.
Kit and caboodle, son.<eos> That won't do any good.<eos> I'm going to say this and I don't care if it's in front of them.<eos> Do you want to be hit with this crutch?<eos> Are you still blaming me for Skipper's death?<eos> I could kill you with this crutch.<eos> Good Lord!<eos> Do you think I'd care?<eos> Skipper and I had a friendship.<eos> Why won't you let it alone?
Big, fancy hotel.<eos> Fella'd give me his car, and I'd say, "thank you, sir."<eos> Here I was doin' him a favor, but I had to say, "thank you, sir."<eos> And the louder I said it, the bigger the tip.<eos> That figures.<eos> That don't figure nothing. You got to be Charlie potatoes, the man with the money.<eos> Then you don't have to bow down to nobody.<eos> That's the way I'm gonna live.<eos> Even when he didn't give a tip, I still had to say "thank you."<eos> That word got like it was sticking needles in me every time I said it.
Needs fixing.<eos> Don't do me any favors.<eos> I ain't doin' you no favors, Joker.<eos> That feels nice and cool.<eos> It's a poultice.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> Want me to say "thanks"?<eos> All right, thanks, thanks, thanks, thanks!<eos> That word sure bugs you, don't it?<eos> Well, I been sayin' it all my life.
Bowl of milk?<eos> - Anything I can do, madame? - No.<eos> No, loan manage.<eos> Go back to bed, Emma.<eos> Good night, madame.<eos> "When you knock, I'll open the door."<eos> "Walk over to my desk and put the milk on it."<eos> "Then go into the other lab and try to find a fly."<eos> A fly?<eos> "You will easily recognize it. Its head is white."
Please don't cry.<eos> We'll catch it tomorrow.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Please don't worry.<eos> We caught the fly today, but it escaped out into the garden.<eos> I'll look for it again tomorrow.<eos> You eat.<eos> I'll read this here.<eos> "if you had caught the fly, you would not be reading this."<eos> "I know you will never catch it now.
The public are worse than babies.<eos> Worse than dogs.<eos> Because they don't think.<eos> They work like slaves, and get drunk at night.<eos> TV, radio, movies, games.<eos> They have no time to think.<eos> That's where we come in.<eos> We'll fill their empty heads with our message:<eos> "Delicious caramel, World Caramel, World, World...!"<eos> Every time they see a pack, they'll automatically buy it.
- Aye aye, sir.<eos> Fire 3.<eos> Fire 4.<eos> New radar contact.<eos> Bearing 3-0-3 relative.<eos> That should be our friend.<eos> There he is.<eos> He's changing course.<eos> Moving in behind the decoy.<eos> Using it as a screen.
Wait for the employee to open the safe and snap his every move.<eos> Then we call a safe expert.<eos> Dante Cruciani is the best.<eos> Dante Cruciani, for instance.<eos> We'll show him the film, and that's it.<eos> Great idea!<eos> By the way, my camera is gone. so what?<eos> At Porta Portese they have all the cameras you need.<eos> But I'm flat broke!<eos> Were you thinking of buying it?
Move!<eos> That's the wrong wall.<eos> Damn it!<eos> We really blew it!<eos> Nicoletta told me they'd moved the furniture.<eos> This was the dining room.<eos> This is what happened to the Rosetta's cook.<eos> What cook?<eos> We know which one is the real wall, right?<eos> We'll break it and we'll end up right there.
Work, come on, work!<eos> Stop! Let's talk first!<eos> Don't do it!<eos> Let's reason this out!<eos> Stay calm, don't move!<eos> This is our land and nobody's to touch it!<eos> You want to ruin us?<eos> A half a meter of land never ruined anybody!<eos> You can't bully us!<eos> Do you know what the land means to those who work it?
Please do.<eos> Give it to me, I'll cook them.<eos> - Just give me a pan, I can do it.<eos> There it is.<eos> Filipo, Mariza!<eos> A little bit of oil, eh?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> The other night you left your guitar.<eos> I didn't know where to bring it.<eos> The kids might break it.
- Wait till I tell you..<eos> With the door open, I can't drink.<eos> Now's your time to learn.<eos> Fine.<eos> Don't you get jealous thinking of Rosa and all the young men in the city?<eos> Not at all! I only became engaged to Rosa on a bet.<eos> Why?<eos> - In order to spite her mother who didn't want it<eos> Your water is good.<eos> Maybe because you drink from it too.

I only became engaged to Rosa on a bet.<eos> Why?<eos> - In order to spite her mother who didn't want it<eos> Your water is good.<eos> Maybe because you drink from it too.<eos> Where do you get it?
And I told everybody, each and every one of you.<eos> Even if I didn't use names.<eos> Because you know who can give.. and who cannot.<eos> And who has already given enough.<eos> It's you, eh?<eos> - No, leave me alone.<eos> Now confess!<eos> You want to..<eos> hit me? I knew you were capable of hitting a woman.<eos> I rebuild your house and you knock it down.
- But Robin will keep you company.<eos> - You have to high-speed 'em?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I pushed her hard, so look everything over good.<eos> That right rear tyre's frayed.<eos> Change that.<eos> Keep a list.<eos> Don't fuss.<eos> I reckon I know as much about this car as you do.<eos> You know more about it, but I have to sit in it.
- The car ain't ready yet, Ma.<eos> - You ought to call her.<eos> Robin's saying he's gonna take your old car.<eos> Too late.<eos> Jethro Moultrie just bought it.<eos> I told you before, Ma.<eos> Robin's not going in the liquor business as anything.<eos> That'd be the finest present you could ever make to me.<eos> We're in most of this territory, but in Harlan we haven't got a single supplier.<eos> The Harlan volume isn't large, but the retailers use it to keep prices down.
And sometimes sit and not talk for a time.<eos> Hitchcock would always say, "We're letting the engine idle,"<eos> and we would just sit quietly, sometimes for half an hour, then pick up again.<eos> We did an awful lot of talking before I did any writing, except for the first scene, of course.<eos> Because by the time I had arrived in Los Angeles,<eos> I knew that I wanted to create that character of Midge because I knew that the story would never make any sense unless it had some attachment to reality and humanity.<eos> It had to have somebody who was not involved in the fantasy.<eos> I wrote that scene very quickly.<eos> I told him I was going to and explained why.<eos> He said, "Go ahead." I wrote it, gave it to him.
And that's how they got those effects.<eos> And this is another incredible shot, the matte shot.<eos> It's combined with Jimmy walking out downstairs...<eos> There's so much going on in this shot yet it looks so static.<eos> You can see the people coming up looking for the body and Jimmy going off - quite extraordinary.<eos> There's a story about Jimmy seeing the body falling.<eos> Hitch wanted a shot from Jimmy's point of view of the camera going down to the body.<eos> I had Doc Erickson get me a big crane with a cage on it.<eos> We put the VistaVision camera on it.<eos> We had a double lying on the rooftop and we had lowered this camera very slowly down to this body until it filled the screen, then backed it up and then had it freefall down to the full length picture of the body.
You'll see things like Jimmy's collar shining.<eos> This is the first black and white separation shot.<eos> The rest of the film is off of black and white masters but his collar is glowing and the contrast is much too high.<eos> It's almost like the orthochromatic look of Al Jolson's gloves in the Jazz Singer.<eos> And then you get about halfway in, and I'll tell you precisely when it occurs, that we go to the third section of separations - actually, the second section of separations -<eos> in this roll because they're short units and the gamma is then too low and it's very flat and we had problems there and we've tried to adjust it on video.<eos> You can hide a number of sins on video, which you can't photographically but I think you can still see where there are problems with the contrast and matching between the two sections.<eos> Do you think the audience would ever see that?<eos> A lot of people would.<eos> If we don't try to do the best possible job and put up the best that we can from the materials that are available, sure, the audience might not catch every nuance but we see it.
- Listen, what are you doing in Paris, Brandt?<eos> - My headquarters are there.<eos> This is your headquarters - with blonde hair, who likes goose liver?<eos> - Yeah, yeah. That`s the one.<eos> - ln other words, you have no orders?<eos> Only a desire.<eos> Look, Christian, l`ve also managed to acquire a little French car all my own.<eos> - This follows naturally.<eos> - Yes, but look.<eos> I wouldn`t last an hour before somebody requisitioned it, but you have combat orders.
No, no, no, no. Christian understands me.<eos> Good night, Captain Brandt.<eos> Tomorrow you awaken to your new life:<eos> Monsieur Brandt, citizen of the world.<eos> lsn`t he funny? He has such ideals.<eos> Sit down, Simone. Sit down for a minute.<eos> Christian, I know you don`t approve, but listen to me for a minute.<eos> Tell me, are we civilized human beings, or are we wild beasts?<eos> A human being knows when he has lost, and he tries to save himself.<eos> When you are put into the army, you are expected to risk your life, but you are not expected to just throw it away.
-He can shoot anything.<eos> -He can shoot a cougar a mile away.<eos> Go ahead now and eat your supper.<eos> -It's good stew, ma'am.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> You didn't say grace because he's bad?<eos> I simply forgot.<eos> -Can't you say grace with bad people?<eos> -Grace is for everybody, dear.<eos> Then why don't you say it?
I'll open it.<eos> -Want me to give you a hand?<eos> -Sit back.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> You don't take any chances, do you?<eos> Where's your sporting blood?<eos> Back home with my wife and boys.<eos> They usually leave a stick around.<eos> You can prop it open.<eos> They usually stand it in a corner somewhere.
So does Kimball's wife.<eos> - No.<eos> - Wait a minute, Lee.<eos> Hear me out on this.<eos> If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.<eos> Joey?<eos> Why do you want him?<eos> Maybe for the good of his soul.<eos> It's been a long time since you heard that word, hasn't it?<eos> Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
And your Mitka Korshunov, isn't he a murderer?<eos> And Grigory?<eos> Why do you keep quiet about him?<eos> If anybody's a murderer, it's he!<eos> Are you going to mow in the meadow?<eos> Everybody went to the other bank.<eos> We have nothing to cross in.<eos> The boat's dried up.<eos> It should be put in the water.<eos> Who's is going to drag it down there?
This woman, is the devil.<eos> Jo is waiting for you at the bar. He wants to talk to you.<eos> In this case, he is the one that has to move.<eos> This guy named Kuroki, does he want to buy my residence?<eos> What will he do with it?<eos> Is it big?<eos> 500 squared meters of total land.<eos> What will he do with it?<eos> 5000 Yens per meter... It's 2,5 millions. Its' not bad for you!<eos> I didn't say I would sell it.

- No, I can speak loud, because I'm a citizen of the Republic, I pay my taxes and they don't arrest me!<eos> - They arrest you, they arrest you.<eos> - What're you saying?<eos> - They arrest you!<eos> - Who, me?<eos> - But there's no motive!<eos> - If there's no motive, they arrest you all the same.<eos> - O, yes?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Then, if you've got that far, I'll take a bomb, throw it and blow everything up!
Ah, if only we had a king...<eos> What're you trying to do?<eos> I'll break your arm?<eos> You don't think I will?<eos> Be a good boy, go to work.<eos> Sure, and be the only one who goes.<eos> It's better, the manager sees you, remembers it, and gives you a raise.<eos> And the unloaders, who's going to stop them?<eos> The unloaders will behave themselves because the riot police will come.<eos> Sure, and a revolution will break out and the police chief will take it on me.
OK.<eos> Here's what I think. And I have no personal feelings about this.<eos> I just wanna talk about facts.<eos> Number one.<eos> The old man lived downstairs under the room where the killing took place.<eos> At 10 minutes after 12 on the night of the killing, he heard loud noises.<eos> Said it sounded like a fight.<eos> And he heard the kid yell out "I'm gonna kill ya."<eos> A second later, he heard a body hit the floor.<eos> Ran to the door, opened it up, saw the kid run down the stairs and out of the house.
You weren't taking the train into Tokyo?<eos> No, I'm going back to Hayama.<eos> That was my friend's husband and some of his friends.<eos> They just returned from America yesterday.<eos> I see.<eos> Thanks for the ride the other day.<eos> Did you know you left something behind?<eos> Your bathing cap.<eos> I thought I'd dropped it somewhere.<eos> I'll give it to you next time I see you.
We'll tuck into a nice plate of "spaghetti all'amatriciana".<eos> -Stop it!<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> So, taking advantage of the atomic charge spreading around the camp, I raced Sonia and we escaped together.<eos> We ran across fields and faced all kinds of difficulties. We used various means of transport and after all these contretemps...<eos> -Contretemps?<eos> -Yes, contretemps, we reached Rome just as it was being liberated by the Allies.<eos> Hurrah!<eos> The house is nothing special.<eos> I chose it for the view, which you'll see in just a moment.
Today Varese, tomorrow Piacenza, the day after...<eos> The day after, who knows!<eos> One travels, travels, never reaching a destination.<eos> So true!<eos> I have never been a child, really.<eos> You won't believe it, but every time I see a merry-go-round, my first instinct is to ride it.<eos> - You are not laughing at me, are you?<eos> - No, I'm not laughing.<eos> - Poor jacket, so many holes! You must be cold! - No, no.<eos> I can mend it for you.
Do you understand that the janitor must always know where the keys are?<eos> What's this anarchy?<eos> One never knows where the key to the terrace is.<eos> You see this hat?<eos> Well, the key to the terrace belongs there.<eos> To me, the kay, Dionira gave it.<eos> The kay?<eos> I'll give you the kay!<eos> Say, stranger,..<eos> when you're through washing these four rags, the kay...bring it back to me.
It's evidence.<eos> Have Lo Turco help you.<eos> - I was at his place,..<eos> I didn't find him.<eos> He goes around showing off his shoes!<eos> He's an exhibitionist!<eos> - He's imprudent.<eos> - Eh, yes.<eos> Now let's go downstairs,..<eos> let's take the bag and bring it in a place I know.
I'll call down my identification. You verify.<eos> Hey, you gonna wait for me?<eos> This dive is to test the equipment.<eos> You'll have to wait for another time.<eos> We might go deep.<eos> Fifty feet?<eos> This might be 150 feet.<eos> The worst that can happen is that I won't like it and my ears will hurt.<eos> The worst that could happen is that you might get deep-diving sickness.<eos> They call it "raptures of the deep." Like getting drunk... on water pressure instead of champagne, and you try to give your equipment to a passing fish?
Go back to your room.<eos> I don't want to stay...<eos> I'm not going to have you parading around in front of men!<eos> You wouldn't mind if I drive into San Francisco?<eos> If I can find the time, I'll take you for a drive myself.<eos> Until then, do as I say. Go into the house!<eos> Sorry to have kept you waiting.<eos> This is a two-way mirror.<eos> We can see him, but he can't see us.<eos> He hears the water but he doesn't remember it.
Keep it.<eos> With the rest, buy you an ice bag.<eos> Hey! Wake up!<eos> Have you seen that one behind?<eos> It looked like Donatella.<eos> He kissed me... on my mouth!<eos> Abbe Lane kissed my mouth!<eos> Do not you wash your face anymore?<eos> Of course!<eos> I wash it, I perfume it.
Yeah, well, one thing you gotta say for cattle.<eos> Boy, you put your brand on one of them, you're gonna know where it's at.<eos> Come and get it!<eos> Or I'll throw it in the creek.<eos> It's the best food you ever ate, honey.<eos> It's real Mexican barbacoa.<eos> It's where we get the word "barbecue."<eos> What is that?<eos> Calf's head.<eos> We take it and wrap it in clean white cloth and then wrap it tight in canvas and put it down in a pit of hot mesquite coals.
- Yes.<eos> - 50 lire.<eos> - Didn't we play on 1 .000 lire?<eos> - Are you nuts?<eos> - Are you angry, sergeant?<eos> - No!<eos> - Still friends?<eos> - To your health.<eos> - You owe me 50 lire.<eos> - l've got a silver medalion, do you want it?
Please, cross.<eos> Wait, please.<eos> Easy, grandpa.<eos> Wait, calm.<eos> Go!<eos> - At your orders, sergeant. - l have to speak to you.<eos> - Yes, sergeant.<eos> Headquarters have sent me a communication - about your intransigence - lntransigence?<eos> I remember, here, in Rome, you call it intransigence!<eos> But in Northern Italy they call it traffic discipline!
-Not now, Menelaus.<eos> Later. -Yes.<eos> Now, now, now!<eos> Will you not stand with me?<eos> Menelaus, we will reclaim her, and with her, all the loot of Troy.<eos> But only if you wait.<eos> We'll send out a call to every city in Greece.<eos> All Greeks united in a war of honor.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's what the future will call it.

That is my intention.<eos> You need permission.<eos> You weren't born and bred in New Bedford, were you?<eos> No. I'm a stranger here.<eos> Then you'll have to have permission.<eos> - Permission?<eos> - Aye. From us, the men of New Bedford.<eos> The sea is ours.<eos> Other seamen only have a right of way through it, and the whale is ours, ours alone.<eos> No one else may hunt it down and kill it unless we say so.
- She likes my shoulder strap.<eos> Then give it to her.<eos> Take it and get out.<eos> Go away!<eos> Boy, how happy she is.<eos> She looks like a young woman, but really she is a child.<eos> What is it you're writing?<eos> What do you care?<eos> Perhaps you want to write a letter?<eos> - Dictate it and I will write.
Will you now free my people?<eos> Great one, bid the scribe read the order.<eos> Give me the writing.<eos> You cannot resist the power of his god!<eos> I know not his god!<eos> Neither will I let his people go.<eos> How long will you refuse to humble yourself before God?<eos> If you bring another plague upon us, it is not your god but I who will turn the Nile red with blood.<eos> As your father's father did with the blood of our male children!<eos> If there is one more plague on Egypt, it is by YOUR word that God will bring it.
I wonder if I have one of my cards with me.<eos> Where did you get that cigarette case?<eos> It was bequeathed to me by an elderly gentleman I met in the park.<eos> Poor chap, he was foully done in only last night.<eos> I witnessed the shocking affair myself.<eos> Did you see the man who did it?<eos> Yes, as clearly as I can see you now.<eos> I wonder what I should do about the IOU I found in this case?<eos> It was signed by someone named Ralph Cowell.<eos> You won't find it there.
He is, here.<eos> The Reds intend to keep him here.<eos> - He's the only doctor along the river.<eos> - When is he getting back?<eos> I don't know. They flew him all the way down to Haifeng... to operate on some very important commissar.<eos> What does he think of this ferryboat trip?<eos> Dad's always wanted to be a ship's doctor.<eos> What's that waiting for?<eos> Somebody to build a road?<eos> Old Feng got rich in the Philippines. He brought it home with him.

"Abandon ship!<eos> Lifeboats!"<eos> Take these gentlemen below and lock them up.<eos> You better get below and see they just lock that captain up.<eos> - Yes, sir. - We may need him later.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - It's a fine day up here.<eos> - Welcome aboard, Captain.<eos> We're taking down the Red flag.<eos> Send it below.
But, Commander, I've come up with an idea,... perhaps bold, but worth a million, and you'll welcome me this way!<eos> ~ What idea is it?<eos> ~ An advertising idea.<eos> Let's say that the child has disappeared, ran away... ~ In short, that he was abducted, that he's not to be found!<eos> ~ Well!<eos> Newspapers, radio...<eos> Let's establish a reward for whoever who finds him!<eos> ~ It's not bad!<eos> ~ "Magnifique!"<eos> It came to me and I brought it straight here.
- What are you afraid of?<eos> Well, I've always thought that the worst thing that any man could do, the very worst...<eos> You know, you can trust me, Henry.<eos> Read this, Bendrix.<eos> "In reply to your inquiry,<eos> "I would suggest that you employ the services of a fellow called Savage,<eos> "159 Vigo Street.<eos> "From all reports, he has the reputation of being both able and discreet."<eos> Well, I haven't done anything about it, but that letter has sat on my desk reminding me.<eos> It seems so silly, doesn't it, that I can trust Sarah absolutely not to read it. She comes in here a dozen times a day, and yet I can't trust her.
It's not always easy, you know, sir.<eos> Some domestics are very standoffish, but, well, I seem to have a way with them.<eos> - I'm sure you have.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> Well, as a result of this friendly contact, I've been able to inspect the contents of the party's wastepaper basket.<eos> And I've pieced together what I think is a very interesting exhibit.<eos> A letter, sir, written by the party in question herself.<eos> I don't think you quite understand, sir.<eos> A letter, especially of this character, is something one doesn't often come across, you know.<eos> I regard it as a very choice find.

And against your marker, you want Big Jule to put up cash?<eos> - Nathan done it.<eos> - Yeah, I done it.<eos> - What kind of a deal is this?<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> Him and his no-spot dice!<eos> Somebody oughta knock the spots off of him.<eos> Hey, Nathan, do not make Big Jule have to do somethin' to you.<eos> Detroit, I'm on my vacation.<eos> Don't louse it up.
- Welcome home.<eos> - I just got back.<eos> Why didn't you say anything to Kaji-san?<eos> I didn't have the opportunity.<eos> That's not good, is it? He's such a close friend and yet you didn't tell him?<eos> Anyway, he seems very happy for you.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Hey... are you feeling better now?<eos> You shouldn't be going out. I got you some medicine. I got you some medicine.<eos> I'll leave it there.
I said nobody was to do Mrs. Lopsided!<eos> Stop that!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> And who is Mrs. Lopsided, may I ask?<eos> Where's Mr. Robinson?<eos> He's... he's... he's outside.<eos> Somebody took the key.<eos> The cello case has gone.<eos> It's, uh, out there too.<eos> Well, bring it in.
- I wasn't doing nothing.<eos> - You followed me from the Barb.<eos> I mean no harm. I ain't got a gun.<eos> Come on. This hot sun makes a fella impatient.<eos> I'll just trying to earn an honest dollar.<eos> Not holding a steady job gives me time to pick up bits of news here and there.<eos> I guess I know everything private that goes on in Coronado.<eos> What's that got to do with me?<eos> You're a man that's looking for somethin' and willing' to pay for it.<eos> That depends on what the information is, and who's selling it.
Then the Governor invites him to a roundtable conference.<eos> The General calls his Orderly Syobo Tuymuku, nearly knocks himself out, then he gets up and comes to pay his respects, with the General.<eos> The other men who were in the bush are now possessed, and they come out.<eos> The Secretary General,..<eos> Maimota the truck driver,<eos> and Major Mugu (The Wicked Major).<eos> The Wicked Major comes to pay his respects to the General, Who then orders him: Burn yourself! As the others did.<eos> Show that you are really The Wicked Major<eos> The Major takes a very small torch as the General insults him and asks for a larger one.<eos> The Major takes it and sets fire to his rayon shirt! Fire won't burn The Wicked Major.
- No!<eos> It's all calumnies!<eos> - It's not calumnies, Bob.<eos> You've never been honest with me, not a single time,.. ..not even in the best moments.<eos> Not even when you cried!<eos> - Bob, do you remember the house?<eos> - I remember everything.<eos> You've drawn it at least 100 times!<eos> Three rooms, kitchen and bathroom.<eos> And foolish me, I dreamt of it!
He will polish it up perfectly. -Who is he?<eos> My teacher.<eos> Master Koetsu Honami<eos> He's the oddest man among my pupils.<eos> Did he say that?<eos> I've known your name for years.<eos> -A false reputation<eos> I've just finished polishing this long sword. I'll do it<eos> What a splendid sword.<eos> -lts owner calls it "Clothes Rod"
Cut it out.<eos> You're going to Maine, not to Mars.<eos> Goodbye, Helen.<eos> - Goodbye, Richard.<eos> - Why can't Daddy come up with us?<eos> - Daddy has to stay and make money.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> - How will I get my allowance?<eos> - I'll mail it to you.
His love for himself, and for love itself.<eos> But a mature man like yourself knows all about love?<eos> - I think so.<eos> - Splendid...!<eos> It's dreadful, my son... and very difficult to cope with.<eos> Are you sincere now, Father?<eos> Petra was so kind... "Better luck next time!", she said and laughed.<eos> What did you say...?<eos> Oh yes!<eos> One's debut is a miserable farce! Fortunately, women don't take it half as seriously as we do.
I'm having dinner with them tomorrow.<eos> I could possibly arrange a meeting.<eos> In this business you can't do things the honest way.<eos> Remember that.<eos> Wouldn't it be better if you left that jewellery in the hotel safe?<eos> I didn't buy these things for my old age. I bought them to wear.<eos> Put your money away.<eos> You can cheat a little on your expense account.<eos> That's France.<eos> Everyone gets a tip, whether he's earned it or not.
Won't you come in, Captain?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I've looked forward to it.<eos> Takes a real cook to make a good blueberry muffin to keep the blueberries from sitting on the bottom.<eos> High-bush blueberries.<eos> That's the secret.<eos> I picked them up near where you shot that unfortunate man.<eos> A real, handsome, man's cup.<eos> It's been in the family for years.<eos> My father always used it, up until he died.
I'll take the child to the abbey.<eos> You must go to the castle at once.<eos> Quickly, into his clothes!<eos> W- what are we going to do about him?<eos> I'll notify the fox, he'll be taken care of.<eos> Now listen, listen carefully.<eos> Once inside the castle, you must get to the king's chamber, and find the key to the secret passage.<eos> Key to the passage.<eos> Right.<eos> Then you must give it to the one man inside the castle who's our confederate.
- It is a miracle!<eos> The gods who sent you have also provided a means for our escape.<eos> This is the key to the secret passageway.<eos> Grand.<eos> We leave at midnight.<eos> Get it?<eos> Got it.<eos> - Good.<eos> Very good.<eos> Oh no, my precious, I'll keep it next to my heart; a sweet symbol of your love.
Go to your room, Louise.<eos> I won't let you do it.<eos> Eh, there's always one way to get into a place.<eos> It's our lives or theirs, girl.<eos> I'm letting 'em in.<eos> -That was much of a welcome, mister.<eos> -No, you're not welcome.<eos> -Put that gun down.<eos> -Come on, Tony, put it away.<eos> Better give it to me.
Coyote.<eos> Lots of game in here now.<eos> Contaminated game, fighting for life, just like we are.<eos> They started coming in a week ago.<eos> Like this valley was Noah's Ark.<eos> What's the matter, Radek?<eos> There's game out there. I can tell.<eos> I can feel it. Man needs meat.<eos> But it's...contaminated.<eos> You'd die if you ate it.
Car races.<eos> A straight road: 300 lire.<eos> A curved one: 500!<eos> "And now, the two of us!"<eos> But the fight with the town will not happen, because for Rosario Chiarchiaro too life will begin to smile again.<eos> With or without a certificate.<eos> Well?<eos> - I'm almost done ironing.<eos> It'll be a few minutes.<eos> You should've waited and brought it to me.
I've led my life here like a bear among my books, I wanted to put on my gray.<eos> - Your gray?<eos> I have a double breasted gray suit, but it's a little shabby.<eos> I haven't worn it in a long time.<eos> - Forget the gray and put on this coat!<eos> I wouldn't want to stretch it, you're a little bit less..<eos> I think not.<eos> Yes, you're a little bit more robust than me but this size'll be fine!<eos> And if we hurry, we can try it on.<eos> Let's try it on quickly.
What would you say if.. we finished our days together?<eos> Shall we be together?<eos> Get married?<eos> And why not?<eos> After all, it's an idea! - Isn't it?<eos> It's an idea.<eos> I should ask Lidia's permission.<eos> - Will you ask them? - Yes.<eos> Ask her!<eos> No, the car is there, don't you see it?
Before the eyes of strangers?<eos> Go smoke a cigarette!<eos> Nanni, you make me die of shame.<eos> - Then die!<eos> I want you to die so!<eos> You'll die of hunger, abject poverty!<eos> - What hunger?<eos> What abject poverty?<eos> You call this misery?<eos> Boss, you keep your eyes closed and life.. you don't see it anymore!
Now kiss.<eos> Now off you go. Off you go, Esmay.<eos> Come in, gentlemen.<eos> Be seated, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Professor.<eos> You may serve them.<eos> Your clothes are being dried And will be returned to you shortly.<eos> In the meantime, Avail yourselves of my humble hospitality.<eos> "Humble," he calls it.
Yes.<eos> You're too easily swayed by sentiment,<eos> Individual good deeds over bad, the crude extremes.<eos> You oversimplify matters. The world is more complex than that,<eos> And good must not be measured on a scale as small As Mr. Land's brash heroics.<eos> What he would do one day, he would gladly undo the next.<eos> To be of benefit, Goodness must be constant, forever building.<eos> It must have strength.<eos> I'm afraid what you seek is perfection.<eos> You will never find it.
- About 12.<eos> I'll bring Halliday back for a nightcap so we'll find her together. And we shall have been together since we left her and there's my alibi.<eos> - You've forgotten something.<eos> - What?<eos> When you get back with what's-his-name, Halliday how will you get into the apartment?<eos> But your key will be under the stair carpet.<eos> He'll see you getting it out. It'll give the show away.<eos> No.<eos> It won't be my key under the carpet, it'll be hers.<eos> I shall take it from her handbag and hide it out there just before I leave the flat.

- Tony.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Why did you phone me?<eos> What?<eos> I'm sorry, darling, I'll tell you about that later.<eos> I just thought of something.<eos> You said he used a stocking?<eos> I think it was a stocking or a scarf.<eos> Isn't it there?<eos> No, but I expect they'll find it.
Taking 4 men like us to a mountain of gold.<eos> - She took what there was.<eos> - That's true.<eos> The barrel was empty, she scrapped the bottom.<eos> - How far is this place?<eos> - Several days.<eos> I wonder how she remembers the way.<eos> - Maybe she's got a good memory.<eos> - No. No, she's got a map.<eos> She takes it out, unfolds it, and then puts it away carefully. When she thinks no one's looking.
- Oh no. Here, dear.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Dad, I'm going to see if Don Gioacchino is still outside.<eos> Go, little one.<eos> May an indigestion catch you!<eos> Greedy!<eos> Excuse him.<eos> - For goodness sake!<eos> Kids, when they see the marmalade, you know...<eos> Then they grow up, they become men, and they can't see it anymore.
Peppinello!<eos> Peppinello!<eos> False alarm!<eos> How? With so many people in Naples,..<eos> you come right here to ask me the way to the station?<eos> Do you think I'm here just for fun?<eos> I can give you the information.<eos> I can give it in writing!<eos> I can even draw you a map..<eos> but you got to pay for it!
What's going on?<eos> Somebody's sick<eos> Appendicitis?<eos> Mats-chan, what's the matter?<eos> You're very kind but unless the baby dies I can't let Matsue go to school<eos> I'm sorry for Matsue<eos> I'm a widower now<eos> I don't know what to do<eos> Mats-chan, this lunch box has a lily on its lid<eos> Use it when you come back to school
"The Baron is 74 years old, and very sweet and very wise."<eos> "He has a box at the opera, a racing stable, wonderful paintings and his own vineyards."<eos> "Tomorrow night he is taking me to a very fashionable charity ball and I have a dress just for the occasion."<eos> "If David could only see me in it."<eos> "Yards of skirt and way off the shoulders."<eos> Good morning, sir.<eos> - Morning.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - A letter from Sabrina.<eos> Wouldn't you like to read it?
You must not keep him waiting.<eos> - I have brought him.<eos> - Come this way.<eos> He is here, my lord.<eos> Good.<eos> Raise your head.<eos> The letter you bring claims you are the son of Masauji Taira of Mutsu, is that true?<eos> Yes, your lordship.<eos> The statue you had in your possession originally belonged to one of my forefathers, Michinaga.<eos> He gave it to your family in recognition of their good works.

Fine, 600.<eos> Vous avez vu, Madame?<eos> Italians, gentlemen. - Thank you.<eos> Commendatore, the spare is busted.<eos> - What?<eos> Young man!<eos> Young man, what is this nonsense?<eos> - What?<eos> The spare is busted!<eos> - Ah, we'll repair it.
Come on and get dressed.<eos> No!<eos> You just gonna sit here forever?<eos> Yes!<eos> Tonight and tomorrow night and for as long as I like.<eos> I don't want any of your homemade remedies.<eos> I know what you're trying to do.<eos> And the best thing you can do for me is to just leave me alone!<eos> You and everybody else.<eos> And thanks for the sympathy, I don't want it.
That's not what you're getting from me, baby.<eos> You don't deserve it.<eos> You're a great monument to Norman Maine, you are.<eos> He was a drunk and he wasted his life, but he loved you.<eos> And he took enormous pride in the one thing in his life that wasn't a waste, you.<eos> His love for you and your success.<eos> That was the one thing in his life that wasn't a waste. And he knew it.<eos> Maybe he was wrong to do what he did, I don't know.<eos> But he didn't want to destroy that, destroy the only thing he took pride in.<eos> And now you are doing the one thing he was terrified of, you're wiping it out!

For a walk.<eos> Want me to come with you?<eos> No. I'll be right back.<eos> A small vanilla.<eos> And a little lemon.<eos> Hey, you! Where did you learn that song?<eos> - What song?<eos> - The one you were just singing.<eos> This one?<eos> A girl who was here a long time ago used to sing it.
Pittsburgh.<eos> - This is why.<eos> - Indeed.<eos> May I?<eos> I am something of a marksman.<eos> Ah, yes... the new Winchester repeating rifle.<eos> I hear it fires faster than the double-action pistol, and as far as the eye can see.<eos> Mister, it does everything but shoot around corners.<eos> Most amusing.<eos> But, of course, a weapon is only as good as the man who uses it.
A house, and maybe even neighbors.<eos> I had neighbors, you know.<eos> Tom Webster and his missus, lived right across the river.<eos> Had four sons, each one of them skinnier than the other.<eos> Always coming over to lend a hand.<eos> Didn't give you much chance to get lonesome.<eos> The house ain't much, but it's just prime cattle country.<eos> And the fella that owns the ranch now, he's willing to sell.<eos> Maybe...<eos> Maybe you'd like to take a look at it after I buy it back.
That sort of continued on throughout his life in all the work that he did.<eos> I don't know if you felt that influence in Julia.<eos> No, I don't...<eos> I mean, I think he basically shot the script, didn't he?<eos> He shot the script.<eos> It was wonderful.<eos> I remember him saying Sydney Pollack was meant to do it originally.<eos> Sydney was involved in it and then he pulled out.<eos> Your father came over looking for material at 20th Century Fox, and that script was down there on some shelf and they handed it to him.<eos> And he read it and he said, "I want to do this.
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it.<eos> It was mere foolery.<eos> I did not mark it.<eos> I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown.<eos> Yet it was not a crown neither, it was one of those coronets.<eos> And as I told you, he put it by once, but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it.<eos> Then he offered it to him again, then he put it by again, but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.<eos> Then he offered it a third time.<eos> He put it a third time by.<eos> And still as he refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown, that it had almost choked Caesar for he swounded and fell down at it.
Then make a ring around the corpse of Caesar, and let me show you him that made the will.<eos> Shall I descend, and will you give me leave?<eos> - Come down!<eos> If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.<eos> You all do know this mantle.<eos> I remember the first time ever Caesar put it on.<eos> It was on a summer's evening in his tent that day he overcame the Nervii.<eos> Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through.<eos> See what a rent the envious Casca made.<eos> Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabbed, and, as he plucked his cursed steel away, mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, as rushing out of doors, to be resolved if Brutus so unkindly knocked or no.
Aw, Let him have a turn.<eos> Well.. Okay.<eos> But I'll have to keep my hands on it.<eos> Let's see it.<eos> Now here is how you hold a real gun.<eos> Where do you put the bullets? Right here.<eos> Say Joey, would you like to shoot a real bullet?<eos> But I don't got a real bullet.<eos> Look.<eos> First you put it in here.
Here: this is an advance payment for your next job.<eos> Thanks for everything.<eos> - You can go.<eos> See you.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Drink some more, it'll warm you up.<eos> - Let's make it quick.<eos> - Nicolino, give her the ball.<eos> - Yessir.<eos> No, not like that, keep it above your head.
Who is it?<eos> Oh, you.<eos> - It's me, miss.<eos> - Continuing to women.<eos> I have a letter for you<eos> Now you're mailman?<eos> I do not do that, now.<eos> It is a letter from me to you<eos> Do not have mouth to talk?<eos> It is better to read it.
What would you do if I'd cheat on you?<eos> I'd leave you!<eos> I'd go on loving you.<eos> But, would you regret losing me?<eos> Very much so.<eos> Very much so, Gemma.<eos> When we came back into the town... .. everything seemed changed.<eos> Even the house was different.<eos> I had always hated it.<eos> And now, as soon as I saw it, for me it was like coming back from the honeymoon.
♪ Sleep... ♪<eos> ♪ Sleep... ♪<eos> Those songs won't do for us!<eos> Foolish bird, come out and look at the world around you!<eos> Can your songs feed your starving people?<eos> No, this is not the happiness we seek!<eos> Let's go, brothers!<eos> – What shall we do with the bird?<eos> – Tuck it in under your coat.<eos> We'll take it to Novgorod and let our people wonder at that miracle.
Naturally.<eos> It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.<eos> As for the blankets, you will notice they're very warm.<eos> Fifty percent wool.<eos> They also smell of mothballs.<eos> When were they issued?<eos> This morning?<eos> What do you do for heat in this barrack?<eos> No stove.<eos> The men here used it as a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
Looks like you found one.<eos> - Me?<eos> -Well, I mean the lieutenant.<eos> He hid a time bomb on him, right?<eos> He even carried it through prisoners' search, didn't he?<eos> Where did he hide it?<eos> Right in his pocket.<eos> - The old cigarette-match gag.<eos> -What's that?<eos> You take a book of matches, light a cigarette, slip it in.
A civilization leaves behind itself these mutilated traces like the pebbles dropped by Petit Poucet.<eos> But history has devoured everything.<eos> An object dies when the living glance trained upon it disappears.<eos> And when we disappear, our objects will be confined to the place where we send black things:<eos> to the museum.<eos> PORTRAITS OF ANCESTORS<eos> UTILITARIAN ART / UNKNOWN ORIGIN<eos> UNKNOWN ORIGIN<eos> Black art, we look at it as if it had its reason for being in the pleasure it gives us.<eos> The intentions of the black who created it, the emotions of the black who looks at it, all of that escapes us.
And it is the same art.<eos> The wisdom in art and the ornament of a useful object like the head support and the useless beauty of the statue belong to two different orders.<eos> Here, this difference falls apart when we look closer.<eos> A chalice is not an art object, it is a cult object.<eos> This wooden cup is a chalice.<eos> Everything here is about cult.<eos> Cult of the world.<eos> When he makes the chair rest upon human feet, the black creates a nature in his image.<eos> Hence, every object is sacred because every creation is sacred.<eos> It recalls the creation of the world and continues it.
Art of the present time, between a lost greatness and another to conquer.<eos> Art of the provisional, whose ambition is not to last, but to witness.<eos> Here the problem of the subject is not posed.<eos> The subject is this naturally ungrateful earth this naturally troublesome climate and inside work, at an unfathomable scale, the rhythm of the factory confronting the rhythm of nature:<eos> Ford meets Tarzan.<eos> The subject is this black man, mutilated from his culture and without contact with our culture.<eos> His work is able to provide neither spiritual nor social sustenance, he works for nothing, his reward is nothing but a derisory salary.<eos> Into this country of gift and exchange, we have introduced money.<eos> We buy the blacks' work and we degrade it.<eos> We buy their art and we degrade it.
- (Galli) Thanks so much.<eos> - Youre' welcome.<eos> Have a nice day. - You too.<eos> - Is there anyhting for me ?<eos> - Yes, doctor, there's a letter for you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Ah, I was looking for you.<eos> - Mister Pisani, Mrs. Gerard.<eos> - How do you do.<eos> - How should I write it?
It hurts.<eos> There, now you can't see it.<eos> Don't make me laugh.<eos> Good Lord, it hurts.<eos> - What about the doctor?<eos> - Oh, that's right.<eos> He was called to the hospital because of the bombings.<eos> I don't need a doctor. I need an undertaker.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> We can use the old hearse if we fix it up a bit.
No, but it stinks.<eos> Don't kill them!<eos> It wasn't me. It was a bomb.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Don't kill them!<eos> They have to be dead if we wanna bury them.<eos> - I'm not talking to you anymore.<eos> - ldiot! Anyway, you promised me the priest's cross.<eos> You're no fair.<eos> I don't want it.
I was just kidding.<eos> Dead people aren't scary.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> What does that mean anyway, ""putting the cart before the horse"?<eos> What we were doing just now.<eos> I've never heard it called that before.<eos> - We'll take the wheelbarrow.<eos> - What for?<eos> We'll fill it full of crosses!
- Goodbye, Father.<eos> - Goodbye, Father.<eos> Goodbye, Don Camillo.<eos> Go home this is none of your business.<eos> Well, are we going, Don Camillo?<eos> The river must be beautiful in this sunshine.<eos> I'd really like to see it.<eos> Let's go, Lord.<eos> They could have made this cross a bit lighter.<eos> Tell me, I had to haul it up a hill and I don't have your back.
You gotta eat to grow fat.<eos> Wait... will you get out of... get out of here.<eos> Duke, will you make her stop already.<eos> Fight your way out of it, kid.<eos> She outweighs me.<eos> Oh, I get it... you're going to go out that door.<eos> I'm going to go out this door.<eos> And then we're going to meet over there.<eos> Right? Oh, that's a very good idea.<eos> Oh, by the way, here's the bowl... You get two cents back for it.
- Oh, no, you don't.<eos> Excuse me, please.<eos> No locks on the doors... people parading in and out while other people are taking a bath... brothers dressing up like sisters.<eos> I always thought this family was a little peculiar... but I never thought they were just plain crazy.<eos> I don't want to hear another word against my family!<eos> If you don't like us,just go!<eos> - What do you think I'm doin'?<eos> - Well, then go.<eos> - Not without my pin. - Oh!<eos> As if I wanted it.
- Ready, sir, come here!<eos> The cab's ready!<eos> Come, come here! - Come up!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come here sir!<eos> My horse is very strong, these are all parrots!<eos> Come here!<eos> And since a stretch in the climb was very tough,.. and often the old and malnourished horses couldn't make it,..<eos> Antonio, for a living, had devised this occupation.<eos> Hurry up, the horse can't do it! Come!
Do you know what were paying Sebastian?<eos> You know how his billing reads?<eos> He's the star of the show.<eos> And the star requests ring three.<eos> Who do you think you're kidding?<eos> I'm sorry, Holly, but the people watch the star.<eos> That's why the star plays the centre ring.<eos> The people watch the star, do they?<eos> Well, they're going to be watching me.<eos> If you wont let him give me the centre ring, I'll take it away from him.
"The Ugly Duckling by Hans Christian Andersen."<eos> I'm Hans Christian Andersen<eos> That fortune has smiled upon<eos> Although I'm a duckling today, tomorrow I'm a swan<eos> A tale I told and it turned to gold, as gold as a tale can be<eos> I laugh, ha ha, but I blush a bit for I realise while I'm reading it<eos> That it's also reading me<eos> "By Hans Christian Andersen"!<eos> I am a swan!<eos> I write myself a note each day and I place it in my hat
Notyet,Cary.<eos> Not yet, Cary.<eos> - Barnaby, you have the key. - Uh-huh.<eos> - Well, look for it, darling.<eos> Look in this pocket.<eos> That's usually where you hide it.
Play it again, Jeannie girl.<eos> Listen, that's five times I've played it for you already.<eos> - People might want to hear something else. - No.<eos> They ain't listening.<eos> I'm the only one that's listening.<eos> Play it again, Jeannie girl. - Pete?<eos> - What's the matter, Jeannie?<eos> - Do you want to run off with me?<eos> - It's this man.<eos> Five times I've played a song for him, and now he wants to hear it again.
- The race that holds on.<eos> And why does it hold on?<eos> No one quite knows.<eos> As a schoolboy I came up with a motto for myself:<eos> "Face up to it."<eos> Face up to what?<eos> I ask you.<eos> Injustice?<eos> I'm not one to go around babbling about justice.<eos> I don't expect it for myself.
Where here?<eos> There.<eos> Or maybe there...in-between.<eos> Right in between? How is it over here on the left, where my finger is?<eos> It seems alright.<eos> Does it hurt when I press my finger down?<eos> Yes, I'd say that hurts.<eos> Does it scratch more after you've eaten calf's head vinaigrette?<eos> I never eat it.<eos> But I think that if I ate it, it would scratch more.
Tell the new arrivals that after 11:30 I can't see anyone.<eos> At least not for a free consultation.<eos> You're first, madame?<eos> You're from the district?<eos> I'm from the township.<eos> From St.-Maurice?<eos> I live at the large farm on the road to Luchère.<eos> It belongs to you?<eos> Yes, to my husband and me.<eos> If you run it yourself, you must have a great deal of work?
More tea, Mr. Allnut?<eos> Thank you, no, miss. I reckon I'd better be shoving off if I'm to get back to the mine before tomorrow night.<eos> - Don't hurry, Mr. Allnut.<eos> - Do stay for dinner.<eos> Thanks just the same.<eos> I probably won't be coming around this way for a couple of months.<eos> Really? Well, what about our mail?<eos> Don't look like there's going to be any mail for a while.<eos> Why not?<eos> - The Germans will hold it up.
Here we are, safe and sound, as you might say.<eos> - The question is, what next?<eos> - Quite.<eos> Two thousand cigarettes. Two cases of gin.<eos> It's not a bad place to sit out a war, then, is it, miss?<eos> All the comforts of home, including running water.<eos> We simply can't remain here in this backwater until the war is over, Mr. Allnut.<eos> Can't we, miss?<eos> You got the map.<eos> Show me a way out and I'll take it.
They're burning my hands<eos> Haven't you chosen two yet?<eos> Jean de Mèzillac, do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?<eos> Mathihlde Martin, do you take...<eos> Hide the barrel-organ!<eos> Thank You, Lord!<eos> What can we do for you?<eos> We have good news for the organ-grinder; we've found his monkey<eos> Where's that monkey got to?<eos> Its master will get it down
She looks like a hen. See?<eos> Mummy's sweetheart<eos> Make up, ready.<eos> You come here<eos> - What's he telling her?<eos> - Blasetti is explaining to her what to do<eos> Does she have to eat that cake?<eos> They're lighting the candles.<eos> She has to blow them out as if it was her birthday<eos> - She won't have to eat it?
Defeat, against him, all that sort of thing. You know it is.<eos> Would you call General Beck a communist? - Of course not.<eos> - Or Karl Goerdeler, the lord mayor of Leipzig?<eos> - I've never heard that he was.<eos> - What about Falkenhausen?<eos> - No, but...<eos> - What about Heinrich von Stulpnagel?<eos> And von Urach and von Haslov? Are they communists?<eos> Are you trying to tell me seriously that men like that are questioning his leadership?<eos> Not just questioning it. They intend to end it.
Virginia! It's all right, Mrs. Cosick.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> I told you, l-This doesn't have anything to do with her.<eos> - I want to keep her out of it. - Robert-<eos> I don't want her to see me.<eos> Robert... I love you.<eos> I need you and I want you. That's all.<eos> I won't ask you to do anything you don't want to do.<eos> They got the net down there.<eos> Where do you want it?

- Yes.<eos> - Oh, whatever has gotten into you;<eos> What are you up to;<eos> What's going on;<eos> - What's happened;<eos> - Why;<eos> Why! I am free to come back to my home whenever I please.<eos> - You are..<eos> - Yes, my house!<eos> I don't even recognize it.
And there's an automatic garbage-disposal unit in the kitchen...<eos> - Are you listening?<eos> - Why do we have to rush into this?<eos> - Lf Mother is going away and all...<eos> - No dice.<eos> We're not staying on here.<eos> But, darling, we don't even own a stick of furniture.<eos> We'll start from scratch, like other married people.<eos> I know. Why couldn't we just buy this place from Mother?<eos> For one thing, we can't afford it.

What should we notify them of?<eos> That ball out there.<eos> There's this gadget Enid and I found.<eos> And defeat everything that we've spent all these weeks in this forsaken spot to achieve? Being overrun with the curious?<eos> Somebody's liable to run onto that thing out there.<eos> Oh, it isn't likely. This area of the moors is checkered with marshes. Many a straying farm animal has been swallowed up.<eos> This place has a bad name. The natives keep their distance.<eos> Where's this ball now?<eos> I'll take you.<eos> You can see it from the edge of this rock.
Owen.<eos> I'm glad to see you because I wanted a word with you.<eos> You've got the floor.<eos> I want to know how you take this marriage.<eos> If there's going to be trouble between us, I'd like to know it now.<eos> Will, I congratulate you.<eos> You're sure?<eos> The luck is yours.<eos> No complaints.<eos> I want the truth... and I want everybody in this room to hear it.
Do you hear? So stay away.<eos> Stay away from everything that belongs to me.<eos> Just make sure that you hang on to what belongs to you.<eos> One horse is coming.<eos> Better drop that cigarette.<eos> The house is all lit up.<eos> You're pretty jumpy.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> I feel it... close.<eos> Like a man feels when a gun's pointing at him... even when he can't see it.
No.<eos> - I could kill him!<eos> - I know.<eos> - It's what he said, what he said about you.<eos> - But it's wrong.<eos> I don't want you to kill anybody.<eos> Let's get started.<eos> She got away?<eos> But I told you not to let her out of...<eos> You didn't tell me she had a gun and knew how to use it.
- Yes.<eos> I'm sorry if I made you mad, it's all my fault.<eos> - Does your tummy hurt? - A bit.<eos> - Does it really, really hurt?<eos> - And if I give you a little kiss, will it still hurt?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Shall we try, then?<eos> Kids, come on, cut it out!<eos> Here's your lemonade.<eos> - No, I don't want it! - Come on.
Take my word for it, I've got to!<eos> I promised my uncle I'd spend some time with him.<eos> That's perfect!<eos> Your aunt and uncle are both coming up on 3rd September.<eos> That's when you're coming.<eos> Darling, I love you so much, so very much.<eos> Just think of it.<eos> We'll go swimming together, lie in the sun together, go horseback riding through the pine woods.<eos> I'll make breakfast for you every morning, and you can sleep late.<eos> I'll bring it in to you in your room.
No, Nick will never confess.<eos> He will to me before you take him out of here.<eos> Mac, we're here to help.<eos> We'll help each other.<eos> I'll give you the pleasure of hanging him, Mr. Prosecutor.<eos> We'll stick around, Mac.<eos> They won't stop at anything now.<eos> You think I will?<eos> Here he is, Captain.<eos> Threw his gun away. They're looking for it.
It's so hot in New York in the summer.<eos> I'm glad we're closing tomorrow night.<eos> I wonder what happened to the air conditioning.<eos> Mr. Hiller probably turned it off to save money.<eos> Oh, would you blot my face too.<eos> Up here it's dripping.<eos> Who's Mr. Hiller?<eos> The house manager. You ought to know that. You've been playing his theatre for the past year and a half.<eos> Is that that evil little man who comes around and pinches?<eos> That's your department sister dear. All I can say is let Mr. Hiller keep his air conditioning. He can't take it with him, and where's he's going, he'll need it.
A Merry Christmas to you.<eos> Thank you, Sir, and a Merry Christmas to you, Sir, I'm sure.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come along Tim, my dear, I've got to go.<eos> Did you have a lovely time looking at all the wonderful things?<eos> Yes, thank you, Ma-ma.<eos> Did you get the big goose?<eos> It's the biggest goose you ever did see.<eos> As big as you and as fast as a beetle.<eos> Wait 'til your father sees it.
You ought to save them for baby's birthdays.<eos> Oh, I hope candles are gonna glow in his life.<eos> I hope his eyes are gonna be like candles... like two blue candles...<eos> What poetry.<eos> I shouldn't have called him.<eos> Blanche.<eos> You know, it's hot in there with the steam from that bathroom!<eos> I said I was sorry three times!<eos> I take hot baths for my nerves.<eos> Hydrotherapy, they call it.
- ...with Shep Huntleigh, an old beau...<eos> - Stella?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - If anyone calls while I'm bathing... take the number, tell them I'll call right back.<eos> - Yes, Blanche.<eos> - Oh, and Stella.<eos> The... The cool yellow silk, the bouclé, see if it's crushed.<eos> If it's not too crushed, I'll wear it.<eos> And on the lapel... that silver and turquoise pin in the shape of a seahorse.<eos> You'll find it in the heart-shaped box I keep my accessories in.
- Don't be silly.<eos> It'll cost you a drink.<eos> - I'll buy him a beer.<eos> Ready, Bob?<eos> - No, but go ahead and open it.<eos> Get something to prop this door, something short enough to get under this bolt!<eos> Get your picture, Scotty?<eos> - No.<eos> The door wasn't open long enough.<eos> Want me to open it again?
Damn.<eos> You, to the left!<eos> three men to the left!<eos> Stop!<eos> That's how it looks when grown-ups play hide and seek.<eos> but when I turned around Colonel Winkler was gone.<eos> He left his gun, without saying good-bye<eos> But his final words, I remember exactly.<eos> He said: "For Hoesch".<eos> They must not find it here with me!
Brace yourselves.<eos> We're levelling the ship.<eos> Land anywhere!<eos> We've got to.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - Check your belts.<eos> The fuel's gone.<eos> There's an opening!<eos> - There go the engines!<eos> - I'll bring it around and glide in.
Daphne, I'm in the middle of a very difficult meeting, ...and I don't know what you're talking about!<eos> How can you if you won't listen? Well, whatever it is, surely it can wait for half an hour.<eos> This friend of yours can't be so important...<eos> - Now, listen to me! - I will not listen to you.<eos> - Get out of my house! - I won't!<eos> You're an irresponsible young idiot. - Father!<eos> And you're a pompous and ungrateful old ass. - Oh! Knudsen!<eos> If you think I'd give my invention to you, you must be crazy!<eos> Not if you were the last man on earth!<eos> Even if I liked you! Even if you went down on bended knees and begged me for it!
Nothing but this is so!<eos> Did you by indirect and forced courses subdue and poison this young maid of affection?<eos> Most potent grave and reverend signors, my very noble and approved good masters, that I've taken away this old man's daughter it's most true.<eos> True I have married her.<eos> The very head and front of my offending has this extent, no more.<eos> Rude in my speech, and little blessed with the soft phrase of peace, since these arms of mine had seven years' pith till now some nine moon wasted they have used their dearest action in the tented field and little little of this great world can i speak more than pertains to feats of broil and battle.<eos> And therefore little shall I grace my cause in speaking of myself.<eos> Yet by your gracious patience i will round unvarnished tale deliver of my whole course of love, what drugs, what charms, what conjuration and what mighty magic, for such proceedings am I charged withal that I won his daughter.<eos> Her father loved me, oft invited me, still questioned me the story of my life.<eos> I ran it through even from my boyish days wherein I speak of the most disastrous chances of moving accidents by flood and fields of hair-breadth scapes for the imminent deadly breach.
What is it that they do when they change us for others?<eos> Is it sport?<eos> I think it is. And doth affection breed it?<eos> I think it doth.<eos> Is't frailty that thus errs? It is so too. And have we not affections?<eos> Desires for sport? And frailty?<eos> As men have?<eos> Then let them use us well, else let them know, the ills we do, their ills instructs us so.<eos> It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul.<eos> Let me not name it for you, you chaste stars.
-Liebestraum.<eos> -I just played it.<eos> -Play it again.<eos> -But that was the fourth straight time.<eos> Then this will be five.<eos> Many of your guests are wondering when they may be permitted to view the body.<eos> -Where has it been laid out?<eos> -It hasn't been laid out.<eos> We haven't finished with the embalming.<eos> As a matter of fact, you're looking at it.
Who told me nothing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - What about you, Ducey?<eos> - She hasn't told me anything.<eos> Tie him up.<eos> - Boss, tell him I don't know anything.<eos> - That's true Ducey, you don't know<eos> Why don't you tell us, Ritchie and you'll save all this?<eos> You'd sell your own life for a few bucks, wouldn't you?<eos> Maybe it's you who'd sell it, McClan.
I will teach you what you must do to find true peace." - Joy.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Because joy, like true peace, begets ardent desire in the human heart.<eos> I'd speak to men of glory.<eos> Did he not say we must find in ourselves the spirit of the perfect knight?<eos> He was referring to the ardent love with which we should preach God's word.<eos> My brother, ardor springs from a heart steeped in the joy of which Brother Ruffino just spoke.<eos> I say all Christians should aspire to do battle.<eos> Especially when the battle is followed by possession of the desired object. You mean the battle for virtue?<eos> The joy I referred to is that felt by the soul when it tames the passions that tormented it.
- "The Harper's Charm" ?<eos> - It's my mam's book.<eos> Hazel, may I... may I see it?<eos> "When at once, a little at midnight, "climbed to the steepest stones on the top of God's little mountain.<eos> "Lay your shawl on the "The Devil's Chair"... "and walk around it..."<eos> - Finish it?<eos> - That's the other way to the sun.<eos> "Ask your wish.<eos> "And if the undertaking is good, "you will hear the fairy music.<eos> "If you hear it, ever so faintly, "you can go to the end of your undertaking.
- Do you shoot it?<eos> I'm probably the best shot in Cashville.<eos> - Bart Tare.<eos> - Miss Wynn!<eos> Give me that gun.<eos> It's mine. I bought it.<eos> - Give it to me at once.<eos> - It's my gun.<eos> I earned the money for it.<eos> And I'm not gonna give it to anybody.
In with one tide, out with the other.<eos> Why, I'm sick of it.<eos> Don't get upset, Mrs Ambrose.<eos> It's due to sink any day now.<eos> Why don't the authorities do something about it?<eos> They know that the tides cause the same filth to wash back and forth. Back and forth.<eos> Oh, I tell you I hate this river.<eos> It's people who should be blamed for the filth, not the river.<eos> The mail just arrived, Mr Byrne.<eos> Put it on the table please.
You can laugh, but on these days people were more respectful and women stayed at home.<eos> Now they only think to chase men.<eos> This song will cost one peso.<eos> I must sing to live.<eos> The price of bread rises, the price of my songs too.<eos> This one is from the days of my general Don Porfirio.<eos> A coin of twenty centavos and one of ten have just fallen.<eos> - Here is the blind man. - Fine.<eos> You, "Baldie", you swipe his bag.<eos> You rush and give it to him, who'll give it back to me.
What did he say?<eos> This is an imbecile!<eos> You're a big idiot...<eos> Moderate your terms!<eos> You were the first to offend!<eos> Vile!<eos> Cause you said that word when the bus started.<eos> Or you wouldn't have had the guts to say it!<eos> Look,.. I didn't use bad words with you.<eos> Put your hand down or I'll eat it!
There was no dagger.<eos> He was killed by a sword.<eos> Now it's getting interesting.<eos> It seems you saw the whole thing.<eos> So why didn't you tell the court?<eos> I didn't want to get involved.<eos> You can talk about it here, right?<eos> Tell me, then.<eos> Your story seems to be the most interesting.<eos> I don't want to hear it.
- You sure that's enough?<eos> Oh, yes, certainly.<eos> Yes, I don't need any more. I very seldom miss.<eos> Oh, got it at last.<eos> Could I have the doll, please?<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but I'm afraid that's mine.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Nothing at all.<eos> - Could I have the doll, please?<eos> - Well done. I'll go and get it for you.
- You never clean up, dear heart.<eos> We'll pull the blinds so we don't have to see it.<eos> Once it was so filthy that the health authorities came by.<eos> They said we'd have to move if we didn't improve.<eos> We had a dog then, but he died.<eos> He had puppies first. Then he died.<eos> Probably from surprise.<eos> You look so sad.<eos> I'd hoped to catch the moon in a net.<eos> But just as I was going to pull it up, it sank deep below me.
You're fucking me over, after all I've done for you.<eos> Don't be violent.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I should explain my relations with her and ask your consent.<eos> In any case, the house is in Ayako's name.<eos> That is, it's practically mine.<eos> I took the trouble to satisfy your demands.<eos> It's normal that I receive this house.<eos> He's right.<eos> So I'm taking it.
Can duty ever mean accepting the crime?<eos> I've exercised my rights.<eos> I've asked to join a fighting division<eos> They've finally agreed to it<eos> I'm authorised to leave tomorrow and return to battle<eos> Towards Hell<eos> I bid you good night<eos> Goodbye<eos> Goodbye<eos> You'd have to have been waiting to have heard this word But finally I heard it.

- Sorry.<eos> - I'll do my best.<eos> Why don't they have all the good news on one station... and all the bad news on another station?<eos> Wouldn't that be good?<eos> I guess nobody ever thought of it.<eos> I got the station with the bad news.<eos> Getting awfully popular, Kip's song.<eos> - I hear it everywhere.<eos> - So do I.<eos> I hear it sometimes even when it isn't playing.
It's something much more important than that.<eos> If McMurphy gets away with this, no telling where he'll stop.<eos> Or where you will.<eos> Pillsbury's guilty.<eos> As attorney general, it's my job to prosecute.<eos> Judge, you talks like Pillsbury was human.<eos> He isn't.<eos> He's a thing.<eos> You don't prosecute a machine that makes a mistake.<eos> You fix it.
- Break it up. Here we go.<eos> - We have a long dance.<eos> You're it. Come on.<eos> We'll go up to the office.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Thanks awfully.<eos> - All right.<eos> You've all been so wonderful to me and I want to thank you.<eos> And, Mrs. Barkley, I'm going to learn your part real good.<eos> I'll probably never get to do it, but, well, you never can tell, can you?
That letter from Bill Kronin.<eos> Oh, that letter.<eos> You knew there couldn't be a letter. Or any letter.<eos> Because you've killed him, haven't you?<eos> You killed him that night I left you alone together in the lounge.<eos> So, you see, I have no alternative but to tell all I know to Scotland Yard.<eos> My dear Storm, whether you believe Bill is alive or dead... in Mexico City, or whether I killed him... One thing is quite certain... you won't go to Scotland Yard.<eos> Why not?<eos> You know that any investigation... into my relationship with Bill Kronin will inevitably uncover your own indiscretions.<eos> And as you love your reputation more than your sense of duty you won't jeopardise it by going to Scotland Yard.
Which I regret to say will soon come to an end.<eos> - Clive, you've forgotten one thing! - What?<eos> What's that?<eos> You haven't got it back yet.<eos> What?<eos> The gun...they haven't given it back to you... It's still at Scotland Yard.<eos> But there's no interest in the gun, now.<eos> That's what you think...now!<eos> But you're wrong...they're not hanging on to it for nothing, you know. They must have a reason.<eos> Don't kid yourself...this case isn't closed... They haven't given it back, yet.
- Well, um, Mrs. Roch...<eos> I mean, Mr. Rochard... it won't be necessary for you to stop at the, uh, nurse's desk. - No?<eos> - No.<eos> Oh.<eos> Attention, please. Will all passengers be sure to have their baggage checked before boarding the buses.<eos> Will Mrs. Turner... Mrs. Turner please come to the desk. Will Mrs. Turner please come to the desk.<eos> He's crying, the baby.<eos> - Is that what he's doing?<eos> - He wants water, yes?<eos> I wouldn't know, madame. When I want water, I have a different way of asking for it. - He is a baby.
Ah, exquisite!<eos> - The corbels are very fine. - Hmm.<eos> Perhaps Your Lordship would permit me to show you one or two other things in which we take a pride.<eos> I should be most interested.<eos> Our most notable features, of course, are the D'Ascoyne memorials.<eos> Every member of the family to a cadet branch of which I have the honour to belong is buried here in the family vault.<eos> Here you will see the first duke and his duchess.<eos> The dead watching, as it were, over the living.<eos> The church is exceptionally endowed also with items of architectural interest.<eos> You will note that our chantry displays the crocketed and finialed ogee which marks it as very early Perpendicular.
- Maybe wear something with beads.<eos> -What I got don't need beads.<eos> What's your new job gonna be, something secret, like a spy?<eos> Something you can't talk about in the office?<eos> All right, so I'm gonna disgrace the fair name of Finney.<eos> Wait till it snows and throw me out in the street.<eos> I'm beginning to think your sister's right.<eos> And to think a daughter of mine...<eos> How many payments are you behind on that icebox?<eos> Not for all the iceboxes. They can come and take it away, though heaven knows it's one of the few joys I have in life.
Yet one day, you'll want the one you love to think only of you.<eos> There isn't much of your herb about.<eos> There isn't much love about either.<eos> Are you new here?<eos> You're at Jock's?<eos> Pretty girls like you like the pleasure but not the...<eos> - Why tell me this?<eos> - No reason, but you should know it.<eos> You see that herb?<eos> If I wanted my goat not to have her kid, I'd get a lot of it and give it to her.
─ That's ridiculous, and you know it.<eos> It's true, Kathy.<eos> We've been quarrelling lately about little, unimportant things.<eos> I .. I bought some clothes the other day and it made him terribly angry. Please, Jane ..<eos> Alan will be home soon.<eos> I think I will go to bed now.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> ─ Goodnight, Kathy.<eos> Alright, Tiger .. let's have that gun you were waving around down at the lake.<eos> And I'll take it butt-first.
And I've got to have that gun.<eos> ─ Sure, I'll give you the gun.<eos> All you got to do is ask, and Danny gives.<eos> Remember the ride we took last night, Tiger?<eos> The money was buried up in the hills.<eos> You were taking me up there to give me my half, remember?<eos> You were taking me up there to kill me, Tiger.<eos> You were going to kill me!<eos> And now I give you back the gun?<eos> Sure .. I'll give it to you.
I've been trying to get you by phone, Mrs Palmer.<eos> I have some information for you, that you might prefer to discuss privately.<eos> Miss Palmer is my husband's sister.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Is there anything you would like to add?<eos> Something you didn't put into the report?<eos> No, not a thing.<eos> Mrs Palmer .. there's nothing illegal about being missing.<eos> We only work on a missing-person's case if it's a juvenile or .. If there is some evidence of foul play or .. suicide or an accident.<eos> When we get evidence that it is something else, and it usually is .. We don't touch it.
Fisher.<eos> Maddox.<eos> Pardo.<eos> I'm awfully sorry, my good man.<eos> But Mr. Pardo is still on vacation.<eos> His month's up today.<eos> It is, huh?<eos> That's cozy.<eos> Look at what they left out of this one.<eos> It must have been a lulu before the warden got it.
You know the truth, Silvelie. And I suspect it.<eos> So then you think... he was murdered.<eos> That he didn't die naturally.<eos> Who did it?<eos> -That's the second question.<eos> Why are you posing this question, Andy?<eos> People... like you and me, my Silvelie, we can't live in an unclean world.<eos> We need clarity around us. Clean air. Otherwise we'll decay, and I don't want you to decay.<eos> That's why I will keep asking until I have found the right answer.<eos> I will give it to you, Andy. I did it.
- Where are you going?<eos> - To the bathroom. Wait.<eos> I'll help you.<eos> Thank you, child.<eos> - Your soup is on the stove.<eos> Want some?<eos> No, you eat it.<eos> Eva warmed it up especially for you.<eos> How about an American cigarette?<eos> So Eva can hold it over me?
- Pleased to know you.<eos> Don, I'm taking you back to Nadine.<eos> Did she send you for me?<eos> - No, but...<eos> - That's the trouble with college.<eos> You've been reading.<eos> There's more sense in this than in a library.<eos> - Right, Mike?<eos> - Education's all right.<eos> It's the people who spoil it.
When a man buys a house in Lansdale, there's a prize. 10 percent off if he finds it.<eos> - Over the bridge and turn right.<eos> - Left.<eos> If you really want to find that house, it's no problem.<eos> Pretend you're one of General Gates' horses and you're very thirsty.<eos> Where would you go for a drink of water?<eos> Well, I must admit, it's a very beautiful thing.<eos> The house and the lilac bush at the corner are just the same age, Bill.<eos> If a lilac can live and be so old, so can the house.<eos> It just needs someone to love it, that's all.
- "You think about your boyfriend?" - I don't have a boyfriend.<eos> Please, Miss! "Dynamite", my invention!<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Don't drink so much! What are you doing?<eos> Stop that!<eos> "And now I know your boyfriend..."<eos> Give me my bag back!<eos> There's nothing in there!<eos> Give it here!<eos> Give it to me, please!
Oh, Alfred.<eos> Oh, I'll try to find something.<eos> Very well.<eos> I will not forgive you.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> - What's the matter with you?<eos> - You're not laughing quite so hard now.<eos> - What are you going to do with that?<eos> - Have you ever heard of Russian roulette?<eos> Why, certainly. I used to play it all the time with my father.
He didn't do much of anything. He couldn't.<eos> But one day, when a bunch of men attacked his parish priest on the street he waded in to help the priest.<eos> He managed to get him inside a store.<eos> That night, on the way home from work, he stopped off for a beer.<eos> When he left the bar two men followed him carrying empty whiskey bottles.<eos> They didn't mean to kill him. They were just going to rough him up a little.<eos> They didn't start out to kill, they just started out hating.<eos> But 20 minutes later my grandfather was dead.<eos> That's history, Leroy.<eos> They don't teach it in school, but it's real American history just the same.
But it takes months to write a book.<eos> What are we to live on in the meantime? - You have jewelry?<eos> - A little.<eos> Pawn it.<eos> But I couldn't!<eos> Blast your eyes, madam. Will you understand?<eos> You're trying to crawl off a lee shore.<eos> Can't afford to be squeamish. I do understand, and don't swear at me.<eos> Start with that ugly broach.<eos> But Edwin's mother gave it to me.
It is a mistake.<eos> - But you are Miss Wulff, and this is Usselrode-Düwenstedt!<eos> - Yes, but the rest is wrong.<eos> You'll be in Berlin tomorrow, so you can explain it all to Mr Keyser.<eos> - Why will I be in Berlin tomorrow?<eos> Keyser said so.<eos> I won't be in Berlin tomorrow.<eos> Please take the car away.<eos> I can't, I have to collect another vehicle.<eos> I have to leave it here.
Why aren't you giving pasta?<eos> Because there's none.<eos> - Why do other places have it?<eos> My cousin got hers yesterday.<eos> - And I'll give it tomorrow.<eos> Then you have it?<eos> - Yes, Ma'am, I do.<eos> If you have it, why won't you give it?<eos> It rained yesterday. It was left at the warehouse.<eos> I'll get it today and you'll get it tomorrow.
I always thought he was a bad risk.<eos> - New talent, darling?<eos> - This is Baby...<eos> Mrs. Talbin.<eos> How do you do?<eos> We met before.<eos> At the Charity Ball?<eos> Remember, when you dropped your necklace?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why aren't you wearing it?
Protection.<eos> I don't think you'd get much protection from an old blunderbuss like that.<eos> That's just an antique.<eos> Antique.<eos> What about McGook?<eos> Son, I think that story is a little too scary for this time of night.<eos> - But I like to get scared.<eos> - Well, I don't.<eos> It frightens me.<eos> Look, I'll tell it to you the very first thing in the morning.
Your father seems to have overlooked a few.<eos> Am I to understand that the gun that hung here was given to the museum?<eos> No, Mr. Charles.<eos> I didn't give that gun to the museum.<eos> It was my favorite.<eos> Originally owned by an 18th-century nobleman.<eos> He used it only once, to destroy a brigand who had certain aspirations... toward the gentleman's daughter.<eos> You had that gun with you the night Drake was murdered.<eos> Well...<eos> Were you perhaps intending to use it on a brigand... who had certain aspirations toward your daughter?
"Go free. "Take your people and your cattle.<eos> "All we want is our hunting ground."<eos> It's signed with Guyasuta's totem.<eos> We're in a bad way, sir. We've had no word yet from Colonel Bouquet's relief column.<eos> Are you suggesting we surrender?<eos> Put your weight on that.<eos> I don't think much of our chances.<eos> Then stop thinking.<eos> Heat an iron, Dr. Boyd. This arrow may have been poisoned.<eos> Tell Guyasuta this is our home and we will defend this ground till the last warrior lies under it.
I have a practice here.<eos> There's a kid up the road badly injured.<eos> I've just been to telephonefor an ambulance.<eos> I have to get back to her.<eos> Where are you makingfor?<eos> Up this way.<eos> Oh, well, I'd better leave the car where it is and hop in with you.<eos> Oh, just a minute.<eos> I must get my bag.<eos> Ah, no, put it on the floor.
She is daughter of his youngest brother.<eos> Ah. What favour shall this governor want now?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Write letter. Say thank you.<eos> Make it nice letter.<eos> Where this come from?<eos> I do not know, Your Majesty.<eos> There is writing on it.<eos> Read it to me, O my father.<eos> You would not understand it, little one.
- I'll say it till I find out.<eos> I told Eddie Mars I was coming up to see him.<eos> When I arrived, you were there.<eos> You two staged an act. He let you win a lot of money and then sent a man to take it away from you to prove there was nothing between you.<eos> You're shaking again.<eos> Take me home.<eos> Sure I will.<eos> But first, open that bag.<eos> If there's 28 grand in it, I'll eat every word I've said.<eos> Open it and make a sap out of me or else stop playing me for one.
Help you down?<eos> Made up your mind yet?<eos> I'll take chocolate.<eos> - With coconuts? - I don't like coconuts.<eos> You don't like coconuts?<eos> Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from?<eos> Lookit here.<eos> From Tahiti, the Fiji islands, the Coral Sea.<eos> A new magazine.<eos> I never saw it before.
Put your hand inside my coat pocket.<eos> There's a letter there.<eos> Found it?<eos> It's for my wife. In case you are lucky and return home safely.<eos> One thing...<eos> Do me a huge favor.<eos> Give me your weapon.<eos> I lost mine somewhere.<eos> I will not be taken prisoner if they find me here.<eos> Please put it into my hand.
- What?<eos> - How dare you, sir?<eos> - How do like that?<eos> Puts a Y in Smith and expects me to let him in the hotel with a strange dame.<eos> - Strange dame?<eos> - She is to me.<eos> I've never seen her before.<eos> Sir, you may not be aware of it but I am president of the Morocco Laundry Company.<eos> You are?<eos> Take this shirt and have it back Friday.
I know it backwards!<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Make sure he's in the tub when you go in.<eos> Just say you came in to get some clean towels.<eos> And then when he's not looking, you...<eos> Then what do you do?<eos> Then I lock the door and make sure the water is still running.<eos> I step out the window, down the stepladder...<eos> Put the stepladder in the shed.<eos> If anybody sees it, we're sunk.
So, what's on your mind?<eos> I got a message that Larry Cravat was at this address.<eos> Oh, you sure that's the name?<eos> - You sure it ain't John Smith or Joe Blow or No-Hit Hennessey?<eos> - I said Larry Cravat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what you said.<eos> You remembered it.<eos> You got a head on your shoulders.<eos> Now take it out of here before I bust it.
Do you remember who did it?<eos> Was it Larry Cravat?<eos> I heard the shot and then another shot.<eos> And I was afraid.<eos> And I hid.<eos> There was some running.<eos> And then- then it was quiet.<eos> Just a man lying there, and he was dead.<eos> And-And there was a suitcase.<eos> - He dropped it.
I think it rolled over there, sir.<eos> I'll take it this time, Mrs. Oates.<eos> Your key, sir.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Did I put one over on him.<eos> Easy as taking candy from a baby. Take a tip from me, Helen.<eos> If you carry the candle to the cellar for the professor and you fancy a bottle of his fine old brandy just throw the candle to one side.<eos> Anything can happen in the dark.<eos> Presto.<eos> Now, I'll just wipe this off and you can take it to Dr. Parry.
-You little scalawag!<eos> -Hit me, if you dare.<eos> -Get indoors, you rascal!<eos> -Don't worry. Goodbye.<eos> Oh, you let the dog back in. I told you: 'No animals! ' Get rid of it immediately!<eos> Poor little thing. He's so cute.<eos> I don't care if he's Rudolph Valentino. I don't want it here. I'll throw it out the window.<eos> Dogs dirty the house.<eos> Listen, Nello.<eos> Come here. Put this laundry away and don't drop it. -Everything's conficated.
Going to deliver the case?<eos> It was high time!<eos> That very distinguished gentleman is ill.<eos> If he dies... Which of you is Gaetano Schioppa?<eos> -I am. -Kindly get into my car.<eos> -Who sent you?<eos> -I'm here on behalf of Ray.<eos> -Ah, you're his cousin.? -That's right.<eos> -Is this the case?<eos> -Yes, the famous case. My friend and I guarded it closely, it's secrets and all.
Do you feel better now?<eos> You trust me?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Good.<eos> Now sit down.<eos> You're going to write a letter.<eos> - To whom?<eos> - To me.<eos> To you?<eos> It'll be easy. We'll write it together.
She'll end up ruining everything.<eos> I've waited every day, but I never thought you'd come.<eos> I didn't come to meet you but to give you this letter.<eos> - A letter?<eos> Is it bad news?<eos> - Very bad.<eos> Then I don't want it.<eos> Please read it.<eos> I insist.<eos> - I'll tear it up.
We can do it.<eos> We can make it last an entire lifetime, Agnès.<eos> Let's go far away.<eos> You're not saying no?<eos> I don't frighten you?<eos> Tell me this isn't some absurd dream.<eos> Tell me you're putting up barriers between us that don't really exist.<eos> That everything is clear and simple, and nothing separates us.<eos> Read this letter.<eos> We'll read it together one day, in the sun.
Following me around, beating in my head, never letting up.<eos> Did you ever want to forget anything?<eos> Did you ever want cut away a piece of your memory or blot it out?<eos> You can't, you know.<eos> No matter how hard you try.<eos> You can change the scenery but sooner or later, you'll get a whiff of perfume or somebody will say a certain phrase, or maybe hum something and you're licked again.<eos> "I can't believe that you're in love with me"<eos> I used to love that song, once.<eos> So did the customers back in the old Break O' Dawn Club in New York.<eos> I can't remember a night when I didn't get at least 3 requests for it.
That's Ellen's idea.<eos> That's the way she wants it.<eos> Gosh.<eos> Well, Mrs. Harland,<eos> I think I can feel safe in saying the job is permanent.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I always does my best.<eos> I trust you'll find the soup to your taste.<eos> It's sheer understatement to call this ambrosia soup.<eos> I call it consommé a la patchouli.
It's very important.<eos> I'm going to the country for a weekend with my brother.<eos> Hello, Mr. Birnam.<eos> Happy to have you back with the organization.<eos> Hello, Gloria.<eos> I wish I could take you along, Nat.<eos> You and all that goes with you... not that I'm cutting myself off from civilization altogether.<eos> Now, of course, there arises the problem of transportation into the country.<eos> How to smuggle these two time bombs past the Royal Guard.<eos> I'll roll one bottle in a copy of the Saturday Evening Post... so my brother can discover it like that.

He shall transport it himself without knowing it, of course.<eos> Then while he's greeting the caretaker... I'll slide it out, hide it in a hollow old apple tree.<eos> Mr. Birnam, why don't you lay off the stuff for a while?<eos> I may never touch it while I'm there, not a drop.<eos> What all of you don't understand is I've got to know it's around.<eos> I can't be cut off completely.<eos> That's the devil.<eos> That's what drives you crazy.<eos> Yeah, I know a lot of guys like that.<eos> They take a bottle and put it on the shelf.
There was a bottle the first time we met.<eos> - There was?<eos> - Fell out of Don's pocket.<eos> That was for me.<eos> This one's mine too.<eos> You might as well hear the family scandal.<eos> I drink.<eos> Don thinks I drink too much.<eos> I promised to go on the wagon.<eos> I hid the bottle so he wouldn't see it.
I like to see the morning run of my dogs, Carraclough.<eos> -That's what I get up for.<eos> -A beautiful sight to start the day.<eos> All the years I've watched it, every morning is finer than the day before.
-That's right.<eos> -My name's McGee.<eos> -My name's Wayne Frake.<eos> -You in the music business?<eos> -Yeah, I'm a song plugger.<eos> I work on songs till they get popular.<eos> "Work on them"?<eos> I thought songs got popular because people like them.<eos> Oh, that's naive.<eos> How can people like a song if they don't hear it?
Okay, beautiful.<eos> If you don't care that I'll age 10 years tonight.<eos> You should be a very distinguished- looking man 10 years from now.<eos> I might even like you better.<eos> I'll tell you tomorrow.<eos> That's all, brother.<eos> This is where you live, beautiful.<eos> Not me.<eos> Lend me your car for a while?<eos> I'll send it back.
That's the way the master wanted it.<eos> You were right.<eos> There is nothing more beautiful than London in sunshine.<eos> I'm sorry I spoiled the day by bringing you home so soon.<eos> You should lie down and rest for a little, Paula.<eos> Should I stay with you and not go out this evening?<eos> No.<eos> You go and work as usual.<eos> Can you really work in that room you rented?<eos> I wish you'd let me see it and make it attractive.
- Example?<eos> - Aestimo.<eos> - Oh?<eos> - Facio, duco, puto.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Camor.<eos> Mercior.<eos> Dono.<eos> You still claim you know the lesson?<eos> I knew it yesterday.
- Bye-bye, sweetheart.<eos> It's for my dad.<eos> - Get off it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Let's go, Sandman.<eos> I'll take this magazine, miss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good day.<eos> A pack of Havanas and a Hudson.<eos> Could you open it for me, please?
Come on in.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Now, what is it? My aunt found out I wrote you. She made a terrible scene.<eos> You haven't signed everything over to that Garvey, have you?<eos> No, but because I refused... she said she's sign an affidavit saying I'm still underage.<eos> And as my guardian, she can do whatever she likes.<eos> You got anything to prove you're not underage?<eos> Mr. Garvey has a letter that will prove it.<eos> My aunt wrote it before we came out here.<eos> You suppose we could get it? He'd never give it to me.
Reel in fast.<eos> - He's gone now.<eos> - Yes, sir, he's gone now.<eos> - He isn't.<eos> Turn around and chase him.<eos> - Reel in that line.<eos> - I can still feel him pull.<eos> - That's the weight of the line.<eos> - You're crazy.<eos> I can hardly reel it in.
You fish for 16 days, hook a couple of fish any good fisherman... would give his life to tie into, and lose both.<eos> - You're just unlucky.<eos> I never seen no one...<eos> - Shut up, Eddie.<eos> You said 16 days.<eos> I only owe you for 15.<eos> No. With today it's 16.<eos> Then there's the rod and reel.<eos> - The tackle's your risk.<eos> - Not when you lose it like you did.
Come on now.<eos> Let's go.<eos> All together.<eos> - Well, there she is, sir.<eos> - Think there's room in there to work a gun?<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Hand me the gun when I get in. Okay.<eos> It looks like it'll work all right.<eos> The Japs are gonna get a surprise when they come on the tail of this B-17.<eos> What about the tail wheel? - I can get through if you leave it down.
Or is he.<eos> Alright boys.<eos> One of us is out of the army, Joe.<eos> - Who declared you in? - Well we're partners, ain't we?<eos> That's a 50/50 proposition in my book.<eos> What do you want, half the card? I'll trade you my half of the boat for the card Joe.<eos> What good would a boat do me in the army!<eos> The one who gets the card gets the boat along with it.<eos> Who gets it Joe?<eos> Wanna cut for it?
- Take off your mask. You're with friends.<eos> - Don't be silly.<eos> C'mon briny marlin, don't play games.<eos> - I'm not!<eos> - Then don't give me those baby blues!<eos> You think I brought you here because... - because... - Didn't ya?<eos> - Or have you changed your mind?<eos> - We seem to be talking in circles.<eos> Yeah, it so happens there's a difference of opinion.<eos> Suppose we settle it with that game you played with McDougal.
I came to say so long Joe.<eos> Got my call for tomorrow.<eos> - Want to go to our party?<eos> - No thanks.<eos> - Need any dough?<eos> - Nah, I'm okay. Alright soldier, all the luck.<eos> Thanks Joe.<eos> - You wish to see me?<eos> - Yeah father. I got a letter here, it's written in Greek.<eos> I can't read Greek. Kind of in a hurry, but I'll pay you if you'll read it for me.
The Cavalry!<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> I know what it is.<eos> I cut the mixture too thin, trying to save gas.<eos> He's making a mistake going in this direction.<eos> Leave it to the Sarge.<eos> He knows what he's doing.<eos> The Sergeant's a genius. He's a miracle man.<eos> When we've no water, he strikes a rock with a stick like Moses and water falls out.<eos> He hits it twice and the water's turned into wine.
Well, I think I'll go downtown in the morning and open an account at, say, 30 or $40,000, just to start things off right?<eos> That's a lot of money.<eos> He won't have it long.<eos> The government will get it.<eos> The government gets...<eos> You're not to talk against the government, Roger.<eos> My goodness.<eos> The way men do things.<eos> I can't get that tune out of my head.<eos> Maybe if somebody tells me what it is, I'll forget it.
Tell us, tell us!<eos> - Tornaquinci is right!<eos> - Tornaquinci is right!<eos> And what said Tornaquinci?<eos> He thinks he should be subjected to the remedy called "the confrontation".<eos> Quite right!<eos> Miraculous!<eos> - Extremely subtle!<eos> And what would be a confrontation?<eos> The clash of contrasts often removes sanity, but at times also returns it.
You really must excuse me for invading your house like this but frankly, I've come to make a request.<eos> - A personal request, and a great favor. - Well, please, sit down.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You see, my grandmother doesn't know I've come.<eos> I'm afraid I'm not very good at breaking things gently so I'll get straight to the point.<eos> It's about the rose.<eos> - The rose?<eos> - Yes. The one Mr. Ballard grew.<eos> The Mrs. Miniver.<eos> I hear he's going to enter it in the flower show.
No, but everything suggests that there might be oil fields underneath.<eos> We should dig, get to 500, 1,000 meters of depth!<eos> 1,000 meters deep with this hoe?<eos> But no, with the necessary appliances!<eos> Surveys, drilling, hundreds of workers... Oh, if I had what I need!<eos> I can't see your aim.<eos> What do you care if there is oil below?<eos> Think what joy if I were able to tell these people that there's a huge wealth in the ground.<eos> I found it!<eos> I offer it to you!
Oon't mind Betsy, Mr Struve. That's just her way of sayin' goodbye.<eos> Judge StiIIman will hear about this.<eos> He'II know how to handle things.<eos> Nice work, Oex.<eos> helen!<eos> Wanted to see a gold mine, eh?<eos> - What was all the shooting?<eos> Just Oex's way of informing lawyers they can't serve papers here.<eos> You mean a court order?<eos> -Yeah, that's what they call it.
Stay right where you are, gents!<eos> That's far enough.<eos> I'm here again to serve ya. You gonna accept it, or do we have to use force?<eos> We're not accepting any papers.<eos> -You heard him.<eos> We gotcha covered.<eos> We're not looking for trouble.<eos> You'd better talk to Judge StiIIman.<eos> Ain't nothin' to talk about.<eos> We own a mine. We aim to keep it.
- Donald, what are you doing here?<eos> - That's some getup.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> Came to interview Lightcap.<eos> - He's not even here yet.<eos> - Not expected for weeks.<eos> - I'd know his pyjamas anywhere.<eos> - How'd he know that?<eos> Get a shot of Miss Shelley...<eos> You lift that camera, I bust it.
See you later.<eos> Hello.<eos> Look, do you mind if I take this with me?<eos> I didn't finish the crossword puzzle.<eos> Where's Miss Harding, please?<eos> I'm late.<eos> Too many feel about women's rights the way a girl I know does about her fur coat.<eos> All her life, she dreamt about having one.<eos> She got it after a tough struggle.<eos> I suppose there's a sort of contentment, and I wouldn't quarrel with her about it.
- Encarnación!<eos> - You can say anything you like about me... but I won't hear one word against Juan— not a word.<eos> If he'd only take my advice.<eos> Where is his gratitude after all I've done for him?<eos> Just what have you done for him?<eos> - What has he done for me?<eos> - Why, everything.<eos> He set you up in business. He lets you live in his house.<eos> Who says it's his house?<eos> He and his fine gestures! Buys a house and doesn't pay for it.
Now, however, I have something more than a hope.<eos> Jim Gettys has something less than a chance.<eos> Every straw vote every independent poll shows that I will be elected.<eos> Very well. Now I can afford to make some promises.<eos> The workingman and the slum child know they can expect my best efforts in their interests.<eos> The decent, ordinary citizens know that I'll do everything in my power to protect the underprivileged, the underpaid, and the underfed.<eos> - Mother, is Pop governor yet?<eos> - Not yet, Junior.<eos> I'd make my promises now if I weren't too busy arranging to keep them.<eos> But here's one promise I'll make and Boss Jim Gettys knows I'll keep it.
What that guy needs is a high, tight, old-fashioned whack over the head.<eos> Stiff collar.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What?<eos> What that half-wit just said about a collar except it's not a collar, it's a belt, understand?<eos> - Frankly, no.<eos> - Look, Lance you make a belt that fits around here.<eos> It's rubber.<eos> Pneumatic.<eos> Just before the dive, you inflate it.
You know, I fly too, but I'm not such a bore about it.<eos> I can talk about other things now and then.<eos> We'll have to find somebody to invent a new valve.<eos> I'll try if you've got another screwdriver.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> That shade won't be becoming to you.<eos> Joe?<eos> Look.<eos> A slide valve with a fine screw on the stem.<eos> Each turn opens it just a hair.
Well, I guess that's that.<eos> Here's where we're starting all over again.<eos> Send me a full report.<eos> I'm glad you got it down all right.<eos> Thanks, so are we.<eos> Can I interest you in our pressure suit?<eos> You're going to have less luck with that than you had with my pressure cabin.<eos> This puts the whole problem right in your laps, boys.<eos> Fine.<eos> It's right where we want it.
I smell some kind of a runaround.<eos> No, there's no runaround.<eos> It's...<eos> I wish I could think of some other way, but I can't.<eos> Your Schneider hit the chronic-fatigue line this morning.<eos> We checked it every way. Twenty times, backwards and forwards.<eos> No mistake.<eos> You mean, I'm washed-up.<eos> No, no.<eos> I wouldn't put it that way.
He wants to see you.<eos> All right, I'll look at the hotel tomorrow.<eos> Drive in and see him.<eos> Mendoza brought us a present... ... and,Roy,you'rethe engineer.<eos> Big Mac gave me the machine gun.<eos> Know how to work it?<eos> -Red doesn't, neither does Babe.<eos> -That's a good one.<eos> -What's so funny?<eos> -Does he know how to work it?
- What happened?<eos> What did I do?<eos> - Do?<eos> Why, you saved all our lives.<eos> You jumped right into the muzzle of the gun.<eos> I did?<eos> Nick, this gun isn't loaded.<eos> When did you empty it?<eos> Oh, about three years ago.<eos> When Nicky was cutting his teeth on it.
Perhaps he'd like to play some golf someday.<eos> And if you can slip it in, just tell him we were in the throes of job-hunting when he telephoned.<eos> It doesn't hurt to impress the old boy. Does it?<eos> Johnnie, really, you are the limit.<eos> How can you be so gay about something... That you should be ashamed of?<eos> What, Father?<eos> Yes, Johnnie and I were just having a sober and comprehensive discussion of that very subject.<eos> He has several ideas of the kind of job he'd like to do and several good opportunities.<eos> There's a messenger from General McLaidlaw.<eos> Bring it in.
Did you tell him anything today?<eos> Did I?<eos> Bertram was furious.<eos> Said he'd never confide in me again.<eos> But honestly, have you ever been able to deny Johnnie anything?<eos> Never.<eos> It was about that poison, wasn't it?<eos> Don't remind me of it. I'm ashamed, and mortified, and disgraced.<eos> I'm just a fool, that's all.<eos> If he writes a story on that one before I do... I suppose I'll deserve it.
I've never been so humiliated.<eos> I'm not going to stand it another minute. I'm going to leave him!<eos> Well, I don't care what you say! I'm going to leave him!<eos> Mother, I'll call you back.<eos> How is your mother?<eos> Your mother's quite nice once you get to know her.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Why, Bianca, you're one of the most attractive girls I know.<eos> I'm your wife!<eos> When I think of how I shopped all afternoon until I was exhausted hunting a surprise for you, and you won't even put it on!
Thomas Fuller Martin, often known as Thomas Fuller, "Marlakey".<eos> I'll bet.<eos> What's that for?<eos> Just wanted to hear if they're around.<eos> With those planes after us and a weak gas supply, there's a 50-50 chance of making it to the border.<eos> Do you mind if I write "one chance in a thousand"?<eos> Why not be practical?<eos> Either we're caught and you've written that for nothing or we land in France and you've got all the time in the world.<eos> Well?<eos> If it's going to be our last hour, let's spend it like sensible people.
Remember when you said you start Monday and get back on Thursday?<eos> If I fall in love in January, I'm still miserable in December.<eos> Really! Temperature of 105, chills, fever...<eos> It knocks me out.<eos> I flunked geometry twice because I was in love with the professor.<eos> Tom, I want my mind free!<eos> Darling, it's too late now. Your pulse is unsteady.<eos> Alright.<eos> Go ahead. It won't do you any good.<eos> You'll go up to your room, sit at your typewriter, mess around with some words, thrown them away, lie on your bed, put the light out, then put it back on again, go back to your desk.
For a while, it looked as though we was beat. Good and beat.<eos> Looked like we didn't have nobody in the whole wide world but enemies.<eos> Like nobody was friendly no more.<eos> Made me feel kind of bad and scared too.<eos> Like we was lost and nobody cared.<eos> You're the one that keeps us going, Ma.<eos> I ain't no good no more and I know it.<eos> Seems like I spend all my time these days thinking how it used to be.<eos> Thinking of home.<eos> I ain't never gonna see it no more.

I don`t want to go.<eos> Despite the hardships and persecution, I love it here.<eos> Perhaps we don`t have to go.<eos> Wouldn`t it be wonderful if they`d let us live and be happy again?<eos> Nothing works!<eos> No decent pens or pencils.<eos> I`m surrounded by incompetent, stupid, sterile stenographers.<eos> I`ll get you a pen.<eos> Don`t bother!<eos> I won`t send it.
Better give me the check too.<eos> And that picture of us in Bermuda.<eos> Don't bother, Bruce.<eos> You'll find lots of things missing.<eos> Wait here.<eos> I'm not taking any more chances.<eos> I'll be down in three minutes.<eos> We'll take the next train. Sorry.<eos> "And so into this little tortured mind came the idea that that gun had been produced for use.<eos> And use it he did.
Call you back.<eos> - I thought you'd gone.<eos> - I thought so too.<eos> Get me Walter Burns, quick!<eos> Walter, listen.<eos> I've got the story on how Williams escaped, and I've got it exclusive.<eos> That's right, and it's a pip.<eos> It cost me $450 to tear it out of Cooley.<eos> What's the story?<eos> I'll give it to you.
What were you thinking with?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What are you standing there gawking for?<eos> We have to get him out of jail.<eos> Send Louie down with some honest money and send him back to Albany.<eos> Sure.<eos> Everything's changed.<eos> We're coming over to the office.<eos> Don't worry about the story.<eos> Hildy will write it.
- It's a wedding ring.<eos> - Keep it on.<eos> It's shaped like a horseshoe.<eos> For luck.<eos> Only the Duke may grant the traitor a pardon, you know that.<eos> But the Duke is in Ludwigsburg.<eos> Excellency, I beg you to help me.<eos> I've written everything down. Here is the application.<eos> What would the Duke want with your application?<eos> He'll tear it up, just as I am doing.
-l can't remember everything.<eos> -You hadn't forgotten.<eos> What do you mean, Robert?<eos> Why are you talking to me like this?<eos> Who has the letter now?<eos> Have you got it?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Where is it?<eos> It's not your letter or mine, Bob.<eos> I've got to pay $ 1 0,000 for that letter, and by heaven, I'm going to see it.
What did you think of that young man I introduced you to?<eos> - Very pleasant.<eos> - That's what he thought of you, too!<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - He told me!<eos> - Really?<eos> - Now, let me teach you something!<eos> Show him how kind you are, you're so young and pretty!<eos> Don't be too stuffy, too much like a teacher!<eos> If he moves to take your hand, let him take it!
It is as if I am being robbed.<eos> You're being robbed?<eos> Come on.<eos> Good luck?<eos> Poopsie, you're just an 8-ball with hips!<eos> This mark must mean a hill or a mountain.<eos> And these markings translated give us another name.<eos> The Hill of the Seven Jackals.<eos> This square at the base must indicate Ananka's tomb.<eos> If we're right and we find it...
- What a coincidence.<eos> - How'd he meet her?<eos> Heaven brought them together, I imagine.<eos> Seth Lord.<eos> See bankers' annual directory of directors.<eos> - So is there a library in town?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I suppose you wouldn't know where.<eos> Well, roughly.<eos> My grandfather built it.
I'm sure there must be many young men who are eager to dance with you.<eos> Well, Miss Elizabeth!<eos> Do you recall?<eos> The first dance. Oh, sir! Will you please accept the humble apology of one who has only just learned that you are the nephew of my esteemed patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh?<eos> Indeed. You will be happy to learn that, when I left her two weeks ago, your gracious aunt was enjoying the best of health.<eos> What graciousness!<eos> What condescension! What snobbery!<eos> Miss Eliza, please remember that Mr. Darcy is a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh!<eos> I do, Mr. Collins.<eos> I also remember that Mr. Darcy is the sort of person who offers his friendship, and, then, at the first test of loyalty, withdraws it.
I keep her underwear on this side.<eos> They were made specially for her by the nuns in the Convent of St. Claire.<eos> I always used to wait up for her, no matter how late.<eos> Sometimes she and Mr. De Winter didn't come home until dawn.<eos> While she was undressing, she'd tell me about the party she'd been to.<eos> She knew everyone that mattered.<eos> Everyone loved her.<eos> When she finished her bath, she'd go into the bedroom and go over to the dressing table.<eos> Oh, you've moved her brush, haven't you?<eos> There. That's better. Just as she always laid it down.
Bossy, you stay that way. I'll get around.<eos> That's pretty cute.<eos> Um, you stay there, breakfast.<eos> Say, what can I use for a stool? I always used to have a stool.<eos> Oh yeah, I'll tell you. You hold this, and I'll go and sit on the running board.<eos> Get her tail around. Come on, Bosbo...<eos> over, Boss... over, Boss... - Does she like to have her ears tickled?<eos> - Yeah, I think so.<eos> - Gimme the bottle.<eos> - Don't you want me to hold it?

I'll pull it between my knees. That's how I used to do it.
I'm sorry.<eos> You're mistaken.<eos> Perhaps that's as well, since I'm going back to sea.<eos> -What?<eos> -We'll be gone quite some time.<eos> Are you leaving soon?<eos> Within a week or so, just as soon as the Albatross is ready.<eos> The roses look different when you hold them.<eos> In the garden of a convent in Peru, there's a beautiful statue.<eos> The nuns call it Nuestra Señora de Las Flores.
- Hello.<eos> Will you give us a lift?<eos> - We had some trouble.<eos> - Williams told me.<eos> - Williams?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He sent me here to pick up your load.<eos> That dirty muzzler.<eos> We carry the load all this way and we don't get a dime.<eos> - Suppose we don't give it to you.
Seems to have been quite a struggle.<eos> But, nobody heard anything.<eos> Funny you didn't, Mr. Charles.<eos> The way I figure it.<eos> MacFay was lying here reading the paper.<eos> He puts it down... he turns off the lamp.<eos> The murderer comes in through the door... or the window.<eos> MacFay hears him, he grabs for his gun.<eos> It was his gun, wasn't it?<eos> Yes, he kept it on the table.
- Little Joe - Little Joe<eos> - Oh, whatever he's doing now I don't know<eos> - She don't know<eos> He had women by the dozens and he swore they was his cousins<eos> 'Til he met up with their husband, yee-yahoo<eos> Oh, Little Joe<eos> Little Joe<eos> Whatever happened to him I don't know<eos> But I sure do like my liquor<eos> But I can see ya got it quicker
Only generals have tunics like this.<eos> I'm so happy you like it.<eos> Where did you get the cloth?<eos> It was sent by a Charleston lady.<eos> I nursed her son while he was in the hospital before he died and...<eos> You will take good care of it, won't you?<eos> You won't let it get torn.<eos> Promise me.<eos> You mustn't worry.<eos> I'll bring it back to you without any holes in it.
Miss Scarlett was mighty near that pretty when she come, but not quite.<eos> Have another glass.<eos> What's that rustling noise I hear?<eos> Lordy, that ain't nothing but my red silk petticoat you done give me.<eos> Nothing but your petticoat?<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Pull up your skirt.<eos> Mr. Rhett, you is bad.<eos> Yea, Lordy!<eos> You sure took a long enough time about wearing it.
Sure.<eos> Dinner comes in on trays.<eos> We're big executives.<eos> We finish the bill before morning.<eos> It's dawn.<eos> Your bill is ready.<eos> You introduce it.<eos> You get to your feet in the Senate, take a long breath and start spouting.<eos> Not too loud, a couple of the Senators might want to sleep.<eos> Then a pageboy takes it to the desk where a long-faced clerk reads it, refers it to the right committee.
That's what you should be doing.<eos> - Joe.<eos> - Hi, Lily.<eos> - No, no, Joe.<eos> - I've got to go.<eos> I'll be back soon.<eos> Bye, darling.<eos> Well, how can he fly in this fog?<eos> It's just on the ground.<eos> He'll pull through it.
And the nights went by somehow like the days, and it never came.<eos> And here it is, the last morning...<eos> -...the last quarter-hour.<eos> -Even if I believed you...<eos> -... I couldn't have sent it.<eos> -Why not?<eos> Because if I'd tried to hold you to your promise and you'd broken it...<eos> -... I'd have died more unhappy than I am.<eos> -But I'd have kept my promise.<eos> I'd keep it now.
He's dangerous, of course, but he loves Ygor and obeys him.<eos> My problem is how to make Ygor obey me.<eos> But what about madam and Master Peter, sir?<eos> Oh, yes, I'll have to send them away.<eos> I'll suggest tonight that they make a trip to Brussels.<eos> Get some tickets for the noon train tomorrow.<eos> I hope you forgive me speaking my way, but I've served you for many years.<eos> I think it would be better if you called in Inspector Krogh and told him everything.<eos> No, I will not!<eos> I have begun this thing and I'll finish it.
This jam that he's in would make a bad case of smallpox look like a carnival.<eos> While the poor guy's floundering around helpless you remove the one protection he's got, his legal marriage.<eos> So he's stumbling around in the open, delirious and unprotected with a she-wolf in lamb's clothing right on his heels.<eos> And not one word of comfort out of you.<eos> Because why?<eos> Because you're too busy nursing your two-for-a-nickel pride.<eos> Operator, we completed...<eos> It's New York calling Mrs. Haines?<eos> It's Mr. Haines?<eos> Tell him you'll tear that divorce decree into a million pieces and use it for confetti.
Weren't you boys going over to start that game?<eos> Sure, Father, we just wanted to see what was going on in here.<eos> Come on, Joe.<eos> Come on, kids.<eos> Let's go to the gym.<eos> Giving a party, Soapy?<eos> Everybody invited?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why don't you give it at the gym.<eos> Because we're having it here.
Now there'll be no more disturbances and we can have that nice, friendly little chat.<eos> Won't you sit down?<eos> Oh, that's my chair.<eos> Very comfortable.<eos> But I'd planned for you to sit here.<eos> I want you to be relaxed.<eos> I'm perfectly relaxed.<eos> Are you always this nervous?<eos> No. Only I usually sit in that chair.<eos> Well, I won't be here very long, and then you can sit in it.
They're trying to work round to the other side.<eos> You're behaving like a pack of fools!<eos> What chance have we got against a lot of armed men?<eos> You heard what the mother superior said.<eos> We surrender now, we're in for it.<eos> We'll never get to the match now.<eos> - Give it to me.<eos> - No.<eos> - Give it to me!<eos> - He's got a gun and he won't use it.
You'll be shot down.<eos> - I must take that risk.<eos> Listen carefully. In case I'm unlucky and you get through... I want you to take back a message to a Mr. Callendar at the Foreign Office in Whitehall.<eos> - Then you are a spy.<eos> - I always think that's such a grim word.<eos> - Well, what is the message?<eos> - It's a tune.<eos> - Tune?<eos> - It contains - in code, of course - the vital clause of a secret pact between two European countries.<eos> - I want you to memorize it.
- Then you are a spy.<eos> - I always think that's such a grim word.<eos> - Well, what is the message?<eos> - It's a tune.<eos> - Tune?<eos> - It contains - in code, of course - the vital clause of a secret pact between two European countries.<eos> - I want you to memorize it.<eos> - Well, go ahead.<eos> The first part of it goes like this:<eos> - Perhaps I'd better write it down. Have you got a piece of paper?
And I mean, today.<eos> She'll go today.<eos> Goodbye Doctor.<eos> You should've told me Pat.<eos> -No, I couldn't,<eos> We've been so happyand its been such a short week with you.<eos> Such a long week away.<eos> We'll have other weeks later.<eos> You better start packing.<eos> We stole a week and they can't take it back.
- You got one or two of your own, you know.<eos> - Yes, but not silly ones.<eos> The perfect hobby should improve the body as well as the mind.<eos> The Romans were great people.<eos> Why? What was their hobby?<eos> Wrestling.<eos> In wrestling you must think quick with the mind and act quick with the body.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I agree with you.<eos> When I was young, I was pretty good at it.
I foresaw a time when man, exulting in the technique of murder would rage so hotly over the world that every book, every treasure would be doomed to destruction.<eos> This vision was so vivid and so moving that I determined to gather together all things of beauty and culture that I could and preserve them here against the doom toward which the world is rushing.<eos> Look at the world today.<eos> Is there anything more pitiful?<eos> What madness there is, what blindness, what unintelligent leadership.<eos> A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity crashing headlong against each other...<eos> The time must come, my friend when this orgy will spend itself.<eos> When brutality and the lust for power must perish by its own sword.<eos> Against that time is why I avoided death and am here and why you were brought here.<eos> For when that day comes, the world must begin to look for a new life. And it is our hope that they may find it here.
I've waited for you, my son, for a long time.<eos> I've sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers.<eos> I've looked into their eyes and heard their voices always in hope that I might find you.<eos> My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath for our order knows only silken bonds.<eos> To be gentle and patient.<eos> To care for the riches of the mind.<eos> To preside in wisdom while the storm rages without.<eos> Do you think this will come in my time?<eos> You, my son, will live through the storm.<eos> You will preserve the fragrance of our history and add to it a touch of your own mind.
- Do you see the old couple out there? - Uh-huh.<eos> It's always those kind that have a million bucks salted away.<eos> Well, I'm going out and pry them loose from some of it.<eos> If he's got a million bucks salted away, I'll bet he's forgotten where he put it.<eos> Uh...my name's Ed Weldon.<eos> Of course, you don't know me from Adam's father.<eos> But you can judge something of my character when I tell you I'm permitted to represent this automobile.<eos> Of course, the car sells itself.<eos> When I tell you it's considered the mechanical wonder of the age, you'll be surprised.<eos> But when you ride in it and find how smooth it runs, you'll be astonished.
You're lucky to be alive!<eos> Pipes!<eos> Change your pipe stems!<eos> I need a new stem...<eos> By the way, that silver pipe of yours...<eos> I lost it<eos> I know who took it!<eos> Shall I tell you?<eos> I already know, it was Gen<eos> If you know, why don't you get it back?
- Well, you're discovered.<eos> - I didn't mean it that way.<eos> - We're looking for nightclub work. Like the Grotto.<eos> - The Grotto? - Well, excuse me, I AM a little nervous.<eos> There's nothing like a cheerful letter from home.<eos> Pa got laid off, my brother slugged a detective...<eos> lots of love, can you spare 50?<eos> Did you like the soup?<eos> It would've made nice hot water.<eos> Next time, I'll use it to wash out my stockings.
- How are you, Nick?<eos> - Did you enjoy your trip to Los Angeles?<eos> We saw your pictures in the paper.<eos> It said you did a good job in New York.<eos> I guess they'll be scared to death if there are more murders there.<eos> I've been scared to go down in the cellar ever since.<eos> Don't you worry, Rose, if anyone murders you, I'll catch them.<eos> Mr. Charles, don't be talking that way.<eos> What do you think of the party they're giving you?<eos> Looks like we're giving it.
You look so cute.<eos> Nickie, have you any pictures of yourself taken as a baby?<eos> - No.<eos> - That's a shame.<eos> I want to see what you looked like.<eos> I'll have some taken in the morning.<eos> Poor Selma, poor David.<eos> Nickie, can you reach the water?<eos> Can you reach the water?<eos> No, I just... I don't want it.

- Sorry.<eos> Are we going to be friends?<eos> I feel that on my day off, I should have the privilege of choosing my friends.<eos> You can't go on like this forever.<eos> You really like me, and you're afraid to admit it, aren't you?<eos> Do you want me to tell you what I really think of you?<eos> - Please do.<eos> - As Smith or as a butler?<eos> - Choose your own weapon.<eos> - You won't hold it against me?
- I'm afraid I haven't.<eos> When I'd get in a cab, the driver was Godfrey, and I'd say, "This is his chariot, and he's taking me to his castle on the mountains."<eos> Suppose you come down out of the mountains and tell me about your trip.<eos> We went to Venice, and I went for a ride in one of those rowboats.<eos> Not a matador.<eos> That was in Spain.<eos> But something like a matador.<eos> Do you, by any chance, mean a gondolier?<eos> That was the name of the boat.<eos> The man that pushed it sang a beautiful song.
- Well, if we find one, you'll be out of a job.<eos> You can come back for these things in half an hour, steward.<eos> And, mind you, he was only 12.<eos> Richard spoke up as quick as a flash, and what do you think he said, Susan?<eos> "You may use my bicycle, Geraldine."<eos> "I love sport, but I love the principles of manhood more."<eos> - I'm afraid I'm boring you.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs Hope.<eos> - Richard told me that story three times.<eos> - I tell it not because Richard is my son.

That is why we are meeting, ladies and gentlemen, to lay the foundation for a nationwide campaign by you to demand by law such compulsory education.<eos> For it is only through enlightenment that this scourge can be wiped out.<eos> Out of the traffic in these drugs, a lawlessness we can hardly estimate has grown and is now flourishing.<eos> It exists in almost every city and hamlet in the country.<eos> You will find it interesting and important to know some of the methods used to bring drugs into the country and the work of the forces of law and order, which are daily combatting the traffic, always risking their agents' lives.<eos> The Dept. of Narcotics, Washington, wages this ceaseless fight.<eos> I have a letter of vital importance from someone in the Narcotics Bureau.<eos> I'm going to read this letter to you.<eos> "My dear Dr. Carroll:<eos> "The suppression of the use of marihuana and the forces behind it
When I take over the county, I'II show 'em what a piker Higgins was.<eos> I'II take everything away from these worthy citizens but their eyeteeth.<eos> Sam, I want you to do something for me.<eos> We're calling the whole deal off.<eos> We're what?<eos> The deal's off.<eos> You're joking.<eos> You're going your way, and I'm going mine.<eos> You're not gonna do business in Kimball County.<eos> You're leaving it the way I'm leaving it.
You mean I have to kill you standing there like that?<eos> Not till I've killed you.<eos> You're all through, Sam.<eos> You're all washed up. There ain't no more room for your kind in Texas.<eos> I always liked you, Jim.<eos> You, too, Sam.<eos> Why'd you kill Wahoo?<eos> Killing was too good for him.<eos> I'II say for you, you state your case plain.<eos> I'II state it plain again.
Anything in that bag of yours that will help?<eos> - A pair of scissors or a hairpin?<eos> - Do you think a nail file would help?<eos> Easily. it'll take about ten years, but we can try it.<eos> Let's make ourselves comfortable.<eos> What about that skirt of yours?<eos> It's still pretty damp.<eos> I don't want to be tied to a pneumonia case on top of everything else.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> - I'll keep it on, thank you.
The note arrived a half an hour ago, Concha.<eos> There's no answer, Maria.<eos> You can go home.<eos> Life is difficult, isn't it, with so many admirers?<eos> - Sometimes it is.<eos> - On the other hand, life is very easy for me.<eos> I'm going to leave you now.<eos> I must say I'm grateful to Pascual for his warning.<eos> If it hadn't been for him I'd have fallen madly in love with you.<eos> If this letter is causing your departure, I'll read it to you.
- Please, Katie.<eos> Please!<eos> You're the one that's been hurt.<eos> I'm not the kind of girl you are.<eos> But there was a time when I was.<eos> And I love Gypo no less for being what I am.<eos> And I can see by your eyes that... you love him too.<eos> Suppose it was his life you were begging for.<eos> Wouldn't you be wanting mercy then?<eos> And won't you be giving it to me now?
- Well, take it and get out.<eos> - What about that call for Dr. Gogol?<eos> - They're still trying to get him.<eos> Here's the American journalist you sent for.<eos> Hiya, kid.<eos> - Hello, Chief.<eos> - Monsieur Reagan.<eos> You are the gentleman who's going to cover this execution?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I wish they'd cover it so I can't see it.
Ain't that a pretty bird?<eos> You know, I got a parrot of my own.<eos> - Well, what do you want?<eos> - I got to see Dr. Gogol.<eos> - It's a very important matter.<eos> - Nobody comes in here.<eos> Come here. Come here, queenie.<eos> Lookie here.<eos> Now, there's a 50-franc note.<eos> I'll give it to you if you'll answer me one question.
- Good, lads!<eos> Good, lads!<eos> Well, we are out of the doldrums at last, sir.<eos> I told you to spread-eagle that liar.<eos> Why hasn't it been done?<eos> Very good, sir.<eos> Come along, McCoy.<eos> There's nothing more powerful than brandy.<eos> I threw a brandy bottle overboard once, empty one, off the coast of Madagascar.<eos> Three years later, I picked it up in a river in Portugal.
Why?<eos> I can't stand this devil's work much longer.<eos> One day I'll forget this discipline and break his neck.<eos> Wait until we're back in England. The admiralty will save you the trouble.<eos> Well, in any case, I'd like you to see my parents.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Where do they live?<eos> - In Cumberland at Maincordare.<eos> I've almost forgotten what the old place looks like.<eos> I haven't seen it in 10 years.
- You don't like the Russian nobility? - No.<eos> I don't like his hanging around you.<eos> I was going to give you the shop anyway.<eos> Oh, you are very magnanimous, giving me something I don't want.<eos> - You don't want it?<eos> - No.<eos> And who are you to give me gifts?<eos> - Wait a minute, you mustn't act like this.<eos> - I'll act the way I choose.<eos> It's your shop, you run it. Goodbye.
Mr. classon!<eos> Well, what do you know?<eos> Where do you suppose he got that idea?<eos> Probably from Mary Smith.<eos> Well, wherever he got it, I heard him say he killed tennant,<eos> And that's good enough for me.<eos> Take him down to headquarters.<eos> Well, that's a hot one.<eos> What?<eos> I had the answer all the time and didn't know it.
You'd better go back to your bed.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you mean that?<eos> Would you really go?<eos> All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York.<eos> That bag's worth $25.<eos> I got a bag.<eos> I got one for Christmas...<eos> Here's what I'll do.<eos> I'll come back in the morning and buy it back from you with a $10 profit.
After keeping ME waiting.<eos> I almost went home.<eos> I was in the second class waiting room.<eos> Is it likely I'd sit in the second class when I could sit in the first?<eos> For a gentleman of brains, you don't use 'em!<eos> Perhaps not. Anyway, you're here, so it's all right, isn't it?<eos> You certainly do make a girl feel important.<eos> VIOLINS PLAY<eos> I love that music.<eos> Whenever I hear it, I think of you.
Well, there's one thing I can say for you.<eos> Gentleman, in every sense of the word.<eos> May I see you again?<eos> I don't mind. Doesn't it make any difference to you?<eos> No. If you don't take me out, someone else will.<eos> I'll say good night here.<eos> Won't you stay for a moment?<eos> No.Why not? People would think I don't know what.<eos> I love that music.<eos> Whenever I hear it, I think of you.

Well, I've read your list of productions for the next London season.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - They're very bad.<eos> But believe me, there's no need for you to despair. The situation isn't entirely black, Mr. Douglas.<eos> Have you ever heard of a playwright called Thomas Chambers?<eos> No, never!<eos> You've never read a play called Good Night, Bassington? Heavens, no!<eos> Never!<eos> Well, here it is.<eos> Read it. I'm sure you'll adore it.
- Either.<eos> Skip it.<eos> I've asked the ambassador to come, because we both felt that a friendly conference would settle everything peacefully.<eos> He'll be here any moment.<eos> - You did a noble deed.<eos> I'd be unworthy of the high trust if I didn't do everything to keep our beloved Freedonia at peace with the world.<eos> I'd be happy to meet him and offer him the right hand of good fellowship.<eos> I feel sure he will accept this gesture in the spirit with which it's offered.<eos> But suppose he doesn't?<eos> I hold out my hand, and he refuses to accept it.

Try to scream, Ann, try.<eos> Perhaps if you didn't see it, you could scream.<eos> Throw your arm across your eyes and scream.<eos> Scream for your life.<eos> What's he think she's really gonna see?<eos> This infernal fog.<eos> Sure of your position, skipper?<eos> Of course. Last night before this fog shut down, I got a good sight.<eos> We should be near the island.<eos> If we don't see it when this fog lifts, we never will.
- We'll grant that.<eos> - What?<eos> What of it?<eos> Where do we go from there?<eos> Does this mean anything to you?<eos> Joan Gale's body was swiped from the morgue.<eos> Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?<eos> I used to be married to one.<eos> And it came to life and divorced you. I know that.<eos> My idea is this: Somebody swipes the body, takes the impression... makes a mold, produces a wax figure, peddles it to the old skate there.
Gentlemen, this is unfair.<eos> You can't bully him.<eos> -You're a liar.<eos> -Who's a liar?<eos> Stop fighting.<eos> I'll tell you the truth.<eos> Gentlemen, I have the painful duty of telling you that you are both wrong... the sixes and the nines.<eos> The truth is that the Queen has had 12 lovers this past year... a round dozen.<eos> Long live the Queen!<eos> Any lie will find believers as long as you tell it with force enough.
It was a tossup whether I'd go in for diamonds or sing in the choir.<eos> The choir lost.<eos> They're wonderful.<eos> But they always seem so cold to me.<eos> They have no warmth, no soul.<eos> I'm sorry you think more of your diamonds than you do of your soul.<eos> I'm sorry you think more of my soul than you do of my diamonds.<eos> Maybe I ain't got no soul.<eos> Yes, you have, but you keep it hidden under a mask.<eos> You'll wake up and find it some time.
Come on, move on.<eos> Here, take that.<eos> Grease, fried dough, pig fat and sorghum.<eos> And you better get to like it... because you're going to get the same thing every morning, every year.<eos> You can't get better food on any chain gang in the state.<eos> Yeah, and you can go all over the world and you won't find worse.<eos> How can anybody eat a mess like this?<eos> Why do you take that slime if you're going to spit it out?<eos> I'm practicing.<eos> The last day of my year here, I'll spit it right in the warden's kisser.
But I think you'll lend it to me.<eos> What makes you think so?<eos> Did you know your wife's real name was Mary Keaton and not Mary Bernard?<eos> I did.<eos> But you didn't know that as Mary Keaton she served a term in the reformatory for grand larceny, did you?<eos> I think you'll lend me the money now, won't you, Mr. Kirkwood?<eos> You wouldn't want me to sell that story to the newspapers, would you?<eos> No, I wouldn't.<eos> And you won't.<eos> In the first place, no newspaper, reputable or otherwise, would buy it, because if they printed it, I could take their shirt for libel.
"And for the future Carlos stands nearer the throne"<eos> No, child.<eos> How often do I have to tell you? Don't just speak.<eos> Declaim!<eos> "And for the future Carlos stands nearer the throne"<eos> Oh go. You have no talent, child.<eos> Next, please!<eos> Posa!<eos> Repeat the sentence you always stumble on<eos> I know it very well!
Somebody's got to protect your customers.<eos> What can I do?<eos> I can't help it if I have to buy from Schemer Burns.<eos> -They tell me the same thing that you do.<eos> -You're yellow.<eos> Please, you ain't gonna slug me, are you?<eos> Maybe not today.<eos> But I'm telling you this for the last time.<eos> When Dutch comes, he will leave some beer.<eos> You're going to take it and kick in with the dough.
-Oh, what do you mean, a swell idea?<eos> Use your brain!<eos> # Goin' home...<eos> I'm a goin' home. #<eos> I wish you would go home.<eos> # Quiet life... #<eos> Gee, but he was a s-s-swell guy, And s-s-smart, too. One time he d-d-dug himself out from underneath a w-w-wall,<eos> And It took him 18 months to do it in. Yeah?<eos> What did he do with the dirt?<eos> Oh, he... he ate it.
The film you are about to see was adapted by Roger Richebé<eos> from a scenario by Irène Starevitch<eos> Directed and animated by Ladislas and Irène Starevitch dialogue by Jean Nohain and Antoinette Nordmann<eos> Music composed by Vincent Scotto.<eos> The voices<eos> Men, women, children, old folks, the tale I will have the honour and pleasure to tell you is the oldest and most beautiful story known to us animals.<eos> On the evening, cows tell it to their little calves in the byres, rabbits tell it in their clearings, squirrels in their trees... wild beasts in their wilderness.
Then how will we live?<eos> Remember the old man from yesterday in the bar?<eos> He has a pearl necklace that he must sell!<eos> Then we will have enough for all three of us!<eos> Hey, I know someone who will pay a lot for it.<eos> Go find him!<eos> I just want the necklace to sell for us.<eos> Come on!<eos> Bring the necklace!<eos> The boy is fetching it now.

It wasn't related to the C.O.D. How old were the injuries?<eos> Hard to say.<eos> And you assume his father was abusive?<eos> Someone was.<eos> I didn't think much of it, till I saw similar scars on the other boys.<eos> Including blisters and burns on their hands. On all of them?<eos> Their scars were much older, but yes- identical.<eos> Sir, may I?<eos> When did you decide where the boys would be camping?<eos> The day Tawes dropped them off.
What was the name?<eos> Before the country reunified, east Germany was the greatest surveillance state the world has seen. The Stasi knew everything.<eos> I've read about them.<eos> I'm a sucker for surveillance.<eos> They had millions of hours of wiretaps, sweat and body-odor samples.<eos> I just need a name to go with an alias.<eos> Real name Ulrich Kohl. Part of an espionage team.<eos> I've read about the Stasi teams.<eos> Kohl's unit went around the world, in and out of Western Europe and the US, it's why he needed the American papers.<eos> The team hunted down east German defectors and neutralized them before they could talk.
Caitlin D'Arcy.<eos> I'm new as of last week.<eos> - Okay.<eos> What do you have to offer?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I'm just taping everything you do.<eos> Well, uh, I'm Cary Agos, and these two youths are under investigation for rape and murder.<eos> - They have legal immunity.<eos> - From prosecution, not investigation. Unless they wanna confess, I'm investigating.<eos> - Go ahead, detective, take them in.
Your butt cheeks are driving me insane.<eos> Let me buck you.<eos> I don't do bucking.<eos> How's it going? Beverages in the back, help yourself.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> I do not know who they are.<eos> Where are all your friends?<eos> These are, like, real showered humans.<eos> No, they're all Hannah's friends from the credit union.<eos> They had suits, so I invited them, dude.
By going to those group meetings, it was like he read Monica's diary, like she only talked about her most personal feelings in that group.<eos> The group--the group is definitely gonna have to disband.<eos> Focus on finding this address.<eos> I am. I'm focusing and freaking out at the exact same time.<eos> I got it. I got it.<eos> He has two addresses.<eos> The first one is on Main.<eos> It's listed as a previous, but it's not been updated in the system.<eos> And the second one is on Brooks.<eos> And I have just sent them to your PDAs.
If he was doing something wrong, he was doing it for me.<eos> - You don't think Jim...?<eos> - I don't know where Jim got the money.<eos> The bank owns this house.<eos> Our credit cards are all maxed.<eos> But the last several months, Jim was more and more on edge.<eos> - He was working on something.<eos> - What?<eos> He was bringing files home with him.<eos> - Did la get them yesterday? - No.

What else does a mentor do?<eos> Okay, fine, you got me.<eos> I don't care about you. I care about me.<eos> You came over just to tell me that?<eos> I teach to support my painting.<eos> If one of my students does well, maybe I can teach at a better college, like one that doesn't have a major in air conditioning repair.<eos> Look... if you taught me anything, it's that the only gallery that matters is the one in here.<eos> Was that a tuesday?<eos> Because I drink at lunch on tuesdays.<eos> I made those paintings for me, and no matter what you say, I'm not sharing them with anyone.
And why would she do that?<eos> Feeling patriotic, I guess.<eos> What does a guy gotta do to get a decent cup of coffee around here?<eos> - Oh, but it's just... - Oh, don't bother, Colette.<eos> - I'll get my own.<eos> like this ♪ I like coffee, too.<eos> ♪ Is it something... ♪ Sure. Yeah.<eos> Run along, boys. I'll stay, fly the plane.<eos> Oh, no need to be jealous.<eos> I said Kate was taking her clothes off, but I didn't say who was putting them on.
There are basically five steps to the IVF process.<eos> One, they stimulate and monitor the development of healthy eggs in the ovaries.<eos> Uh, two, they harvest the eggs.<eos> Three, they select and secure sperm.<eos> Four, they, uh, combine the egg and the sperm in a lab and provide an appropriate environment for fertilization and early embryo growth.<eos> And five, they select-- Identify the best embryos and transfer them to the uterus.
The medical board.<eos> A-and-- and if I can't sue, then I am gonna go to the press and I am gonna bring attention to this system, to this process that is so broken,<eos> I don't even know where to start fixing it! Okay, are you angry at me?<eos> 'Cause you're actually yelling at me.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, no, Addison.<eos> I just...<eos> Ever since Pete's heart attack, I feel like I've been trying to be the perfect wife and mother and not a doctor.<eos> I haven't let myself realize the effect that my suspension has had on my patients, whom I just... abandoned.<eos> You didn't completely abandon them. No, I did.
Carlos?<eos> You know I have a soft spot for the Latin lovers.<eos> - You better watch it. - Oh!<eos> What's the matter?<eos> What happened?<eos> What's up?<eos> I started...<eos> I started IVF treatments a couple of days ago... Oh, okay. And I-<eos> IVF.<eos> Jake's been giving them to me.
At 2:15?<eos> It was an early evening.<eos> And I was at some stupid event. - Anyway...<eos> - Line three for you.<eos> Zeke said she sounded upset.<eos> I called her the minute I got home but it went straight to voice mail.<eos> Do you know what she was upset about?<eos> Have you seen the blogs?<eos> All these on-line attacks.<eos> She takes them so personally.
Hey, um, I don't think my assistant RSVP'd...<eos> If you're not on the list, you're not getting in.<eos> Listen to me-<eos> - Trent!<eos> Hey!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> This is amazing!<eos> It's been a few years. We met at the opening of Hyperion, July, 2007.<eos> Total downpour. I was with Kate Moss. She had on these amazing leather pants.<eos> You saved them with that giant umbrella of yours.
Okay? But I have done something kinda great.<eos> What?<eos> - Ha!<eos> Aah!<eos> - Hello. - Did she trip?<eos> Uh, I think she dropped something.<eos> Babe, your folks are here.<eos> No, this is just...<eos> Such a surprise.<eos> Yeah, well, I called them because life is short.
Both blasts from the past.<eos> Do we think there's a connection?<eos> Crime scene photo doesn't do the trace justice.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's lovely.<eos> What the heck is it?<eos> The trace you got from your motel vic's face is pollen.<eos> From the flame lily.<eos> The particles, not unlike one David Hodges, exhibit a highly-sculptured outer shell.<eos> Helps them cling to passing bodies in desperate hopes of propagation.
Yes, he is.<eos> Too bad for us.<eos> Clear the room.<eos> I'm very impressed with the way you've handled coming back to the real world.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Representative Richard Johnson-- mean anything to you?<eos> I watch the news.<eos> How would you feel about running for his seat in the upcoming special election?<eos> I would consider it a honor to work with a man who's actually fought the war on terror.<eos> Who's lived among the enemy, and understands them.
Oh, Flanders, you are my personal savior.<eos> Oh, that's nice, but I don't approve of...<eos> Hail Flanders!<eos> Mightier than Jesus!<eos> Yes, I, uh, I hereby call to order this meeting of the North American Man-Bot Love Association.<eos> I'll say this one more time: we really should change that name.<eos> Yes, all right, I'll change it to whatever you like, as long as "Man-Bot Love" is in there somewhere.<eos> Now, let's look at these blueprints, shall we?<eos> Wish I'd thought of that.<eos> Uh, first, we remotely adjust them so they will never be malicious again.
We're sorry. Sometimes we get stuck in our own little world.<eos> And then in that world, we make even littler worlds.<eos> And sometimes there are tunnels between those worlds.<eos> Or a subway.<eos> One time a snake.<eos> We're sorry.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Of course, I do.<eos> It's perfect. I mean, I can rearrange the throw pillows.<eos> You have them arranged by size instead of color, but--
Let me tell you something, if I had a dollar for every time Molly wanted to borrow money from me, she'd want to borrow that too.<eos> All right, Victoria's moving out.<eos> Mike, why don't you help her, since this was your brilliant idea.<eos> What?<eos> ! You told my baby to move out?<eos> God, no.<eos> Oh, don't remember telling the eagle to soar, huh?<eos> How about calling your fiancé a pit bull?<eos> Now, before you see it as a bad thing... pit bulls are actually sweet, loving dogs.<eos> It's the owners who make them mean.
We know it's Esteban Navarro.<eos> The evidence that we have against Esteban is circumstantial, just like O'Shay said. Wait.<eos> Whoa, whoa.<eos> You're on O'Shay's side now?<eos> Don't do that, Wolfe.<eos> All right?<eos> I'm just saying that it's possible that Esteban is innocent.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Phil's got jewelry from all three of the girls? He has a scanner.<eos> Maybe he went to the crime scene and got them there.
- Hello.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> They're in need of a lawyer.<eos> They were referred to me by a friend of a friend who...<eos> I thought you might be able to help them.<eos> Okay. What's going on?<eos> Our daughter, Min, she was stolen.<eos> What do you mean, stolen?<eos> She was our second child, which... some of the local governments have been stealing children from people who violate the one-child policy.<eos> They put them in orphanage, which then sell them for adoption in foreign countries.
- No!<eos> - No! Supposed to be my damn vacation.<eos> At first, for the violators, they might lock the parents up some.<eos> Then they started tearing down our homes.<eos> This to people who had more than one child.<eos> Or single mothers.<eos> Yes. Then they started confiscating our children.<eos> The Chinese government does this?<eos> Local governments.<eos> They would sell them on the black market or just put them in orphanage which would do so.
If this were about you, I'd hand the child over myself.<eos> But it's not.<eos> It's about Lee.<eos> I find life and the law often come down to what judge you get.<eos> I was adopted by a white family at birth.<eos> Did I grow up white-identified?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Could be.<eos> What I do know... my adoptive parents were my parents.<eos> They loved me, and I loved them right back.
- We believe...<eos> - You sure wanna see this?<eos> What you've been hiding from me?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> 80% certain he was here.<eos> A ground assault is preferable in terms of collateral damage.<eos> But impossible in the time frame.<eos> That's a school sir.<eos> Don't cloud the issue.<eos> If Abu Nazir is taking refuge among children he is putting them at risk, not us.
How could that possibly work as a tactic?<eos> The fact is, once I saw those incompletes, I knew your parents screwed you up.<eos> The details are just gravy.<eos> You're wrong. The only evidence you have is proof of something else.<eos> I ran away from home.<eos> Because you had lousy parents.<eos> Because I didn't.<eos> All my friends' parents were divorced or having affairs or barely knew their kids' birthdays.<eos> You envied their dysfunction?<eos> I-I thought it made them deeper somehow.
House is an ass, but he's an intuitive ass.<eos> He obviously noticed something.<eos> Yeah, the fact that we work well together.<eos> He thrives on conflict and is looking for someone to torment.<eos> Don't let it be us.<eos> I don't see how that's possible.<eos> Tommy's the most popular guy in his office.<eos> He's even had defendants thank him after they were sentenced.<eos> Why would they thank him?<eos> Because he doesn't treat them like scum.

So the scam was on him.<eos> And on us.<eos> You want all the assets.<eos> He needs to be in a facility.<eos> It's the only way I can afford it, that much is true.<eos> Look, chances are, he'll never know.<eos> I know he's sympathetic.<eos> And in his position, I might have been tempted to do exactly what Mr. Peyton did.<eos> But I wouldn't have for a very simple reason:<eos> once you play ball with kidnappers, you then make it easier for them to do what they do.
You motherfuckers.<eos> I'll kill you all today.<eos> Who wants to die first?<eos> Who the fuck wants to die first?<eos> Chul was expelled from school before finishing the first semester of the first year of middle school.<eos> You know pigs...<eos> Pigs probably think their only happiness is to get fat.<eos> Who'll eat more quickly and much more than others.<eos> That's all they think about.<eos> So, they think getting fat is what makes them happy.
It's an exfoliating... scrub.<eos> Buddy, can you grab the safety shears?<eos> You know what, Phil?<eos> Keep it up. And I admire you and Manny. I know what it's like<eos> - to stare down skepticism from a loved one.<eos> - Cam, not now.<eos> Why not now? It's Thanksgiving.<eos> Families gather.<eos> Issues come up.<eos> Only if you bring them up.
Dr. Lee, this situation is out of control.<eos> Have you seen what's happening at the refugee camp?<eos> General Villanova is proceeding as directed.<eos> You told him to attack innocent people?<eos> It was not our side who showed the first signs of aggression.<eos> We are the responders, not the instigators.<eos> When Fallon was murdered, they got frightened.<eos> They attacked you.<eos> They were confused.<eos> My men were there as peacekeepers. The abnormals took them hostage. How is that confusing?
- Yay.<eos> You are?<eos> You're old.<eos> Facts pull the ears.<eos> My favorite day of the year, is my birthday... because there is always a party and lots of presents.<eos> What about the gifts?<eos> Really dad, where are the gifts?<eos> Because you were in charge of hiding them, right?<eos> It's true, I was in charge.<eos> But I don't remember where I put them.
Open the door.<eos> Honey, you know how dangerous it is to close the door with the latch on the ship.<eos> So come on, open up.<eos> Valeria, honey, what are you doing in bed?<eos> Valeria, what's wrong?<eos> What's the matter, you're not well?<eos> We are waiting with cake and balloons.<eos> I didn't find any gifts.<eos> Well, of course, honey.<eos> You didn't find any gifts because we had them closely guarded.
We are waiting with cake and balloons.<eos> I didn't find any gifts.<eos> Well, of course, honey.<eos> You didn't find any gifts because we had them closely guarded.<eos> Here is your gift.<eos> Here you go, sweetie.<eos> They are vouchers for a family camping trip... like every year.<eos> Are the vouchers mine?<eos> Of course.<eos> Then I will hand them out.
I made four eggs.<eos> I mean, normally, I would want eight or ten, but, uh...<eos> With my age, it's...<eos> And your FSH levels, I mean, this is--<eos> I thought I was the eggless wonder.<eos> Well, you are not the eggless wonder.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God. I've gotta, um...<eos> I have to pick a donor, right now.<eos> No, no, no. Right now I need to take these eggs because you could start ovulating any minute, and I want to get them before you do.
I'd do whatever was in my power to protect him.<eos> You lost your brother, Yusuf.<eos> I lost someone very close to me too.<eos> It changed everything.<eos> You and me... We're not that different.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> For our children to walk down the street and not be afraid.<eos> Show me where those explosives are.<eos> The location is not on the map.<eos> Then you'll take us to them.
Heart rate's up a bit.<eos> Yours would be too if you had a spiderbot sucking your cerebral cortex.<eos> Do you think whatever they're experiencing in there can affect their bodies out here?<eos> Don't know.<eos> There's no Praxian virtual reality for dummies yet.<eos> Ugh, no way! What?<eos> What is it?<eos> This nanite.<eos> Every time I put up a new firewall, it punches right through it.<eos> It's already co-opted a few secondary systems, shunted them off-line.
No.<eos> No?<eos> Oh, there's nothing to be scared of, sweetie.<eos> I'll be right here.<eos> What about... spiders?<eos> Spiders.<eos> Well...<eos> I hate spiders.<eos> So do I.<eos> At least I used to... but I'm not scared of them anymore.
I can't... I can't talk right now.<eos> I'm gonna have to go.<eos> God. I...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know what to think about this.<eos> What's to think about?<eos> Well, what about my house?<eos> I mean, yes, it smells, and there are slug trails all over the carpet.<eos> But that's where my friends are.<eos> And I can't have them round cos you hate them.
But we did find something interesting.<eos> Look at this.<eos> ...it's worth the risk.<eos> Hey, maybe, uh... Hey, maybe you shouldn't, uh...<eos> That bag... wasn't at the scene.<eos> Yeah, I wonder what the hell was in that bag?<eos> There's a lot of ancient skeletal remains up there.<eos> Wait a minute. Some unscrupulous collectors would pay a lot for the artifacts up there.<eos> Could be.<eos> Okay, so, these two kids surprise him, and he kills them 'cause he wants to keep his secret.
I've never seen him.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Do you think he did it?<eos> He's, uh, someone we're looking into.<eos> How are you handling all this?<eos> Oh, you know.<eos> Not great.<eos> The worst part is, I lost both my roommates, and I'm all alone.<eos> I've never lived by myself before.<eos> So your-your friends-- they, uh... they never told you about anyone threatening them or scaring them this past week?

Smells like a morgue.<eos> Where is everybody?<eos> Found them.<eos> They tried to shoot their way out.<eos> Didn't get very far.<eos> Looks like they built the virus.<eos> And took it with them.<eos> Ziva says the HazMat teams are clearing the lab now.<eos> Ducky will be able to autopsy the bodies soon.<eos> I think we know what killed them.
As strange as it may seem, the code provides us with an astonishingly successful description of our world.<eos> Its most ethereal numbers have starkly real applications.<eos> Its patterns can explain one of the most profound processes in nature - how living things grow.<eos> This is a picture of something I've been fascinated by ever since I became a mathematician.<eos> It's an X-ray of a marine animal called a nautilus.<eos> And this spiral here is one of the iconic images of mathematics.<eos> Now, while I've seen pictures like this hundreds of times, I've never actually seen the animal for real.<eos> 'At Brooklyn College, biologist Jennifer Basil keeps five of these aquatic denizens, 'for her research into the evolution of intelligence.'<eos> We keep the animals in these tall tanks because they're naturally active at night and they like darkness, they live in deep water.<eos> They also like to go up and down in the water column, that kind of makes them happy.
This is Number Five.<eos> Ah, wow.<eos> Yeah. Gosh, big eyes.<eos> They have huge eyes, great for seeing in low light conditions.<eos> So, here's that beautiful shell.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And the striping pattern helps them hide where they live.<eos> I've never seen the animal before inside the shell, what is it?<eos> They're related to octopuses, squids and cuttlefish.<eos> It's a little bit like an octopus with a shell and what's amazing about them is that their lineage is hundreds of millions of years old and they haven't changed very much in all that time. We call them a living fossil.
The power of a nuclear bomb comes from a chain reaction of spitting atomic nuclei.<eos> In the 1950s, a young researcher called Fred Reines realised that this chain reaction would produce an intense burst of neutrinos, and so be the perfect place to hunt for the elusive particle.<eos> But detecting neutrinos from a nuclear explosion wasn't practical.<eos> So Reines turned his attention to the much more controlled chain reaction in a nuclear reactor.<eos> Although most neutrinos produced by the reactor passed through the gaps inside atoms, so many neutrinos were produced that every now and then, one would collide with an atom's nucleus.<eos> When it did, a charged particle would be ejected.<eos> He set up his experiment, which he called Project Poltergeist, and waited for the characteristic signal of this interaction - a distinctive double pulse of energy.<eos> In June 1956, Reines announced that he had detected the neutrino.<eos> Since that discovery, we've become a bit more adept at creating and observing this most elusive of particles.<eos> We've created neutrinos in man-made particle accelerators like the ones in CERN in Geneva, as well as detecting them naturally in cosmic rays and from the sun.
It sucks.<eos> I miss him a lot.<eos> Yeah, well, you're not doing yourself any favors, sitting around reading "Pride and Prejudice."<eos> That's just gonna make it worse. You might as well be listening to Adele.<eos> Hey, she totally gets it, and so does Jane Austen.<eos> You know what you need?<eos> A new life?<eos> A distraction.<eos> And it just so happens, I know the perfect post-breakup routine.<eos> Tonight you and I go get chili-cheese dogs from gray's papaya. We smuggle them into a double feature at the Angelika.
Nothing happened.<eos> How did I get here, then?<eos> You were a little bit wobbly.<eos> I tried to take you home, but you became very adamant about me not seeing it.<eos> You are married, yes?<eos> No.<eos> You live with someone, then?<eos> No.<eos> Um, where are my pants?<eos> You took them off yourself.
You know what?<eos> I'm gonna get Monty to step in for you.<eos> No, I put evertyhing on this.<eos> I got to win.<eos> Yeah, but if you're not feeling well, Jimmy,<eos> - then you can't...<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> All right.<eos> We're looking for a physically fit white male in his 20s to early 30s.<eos> He's killing these men, but he's not robbing or sexually assaulting them.
I can't arrest Mr. Reed anymore.<eos> But he did bring up several points that I think we should talk about.<eos> Points?<eos> No, he had no points.<eos> Do you know what it's like to have someone standing over your shoulder day and night, looking for that one thing that could get you fired? A little, yes.<eos> Well, that's what Reed does -- did.<eos> He wanted to get rid of teachers like me. Teachers like you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> See, I personally call several students every morning just to get them out of bed because their parents couldn't care less.<eos> And of course, these kids -- they've got troubles, but putting them on the street won't help them!
Now, I know you didn't want that because of how you let him go. Nah.<eos> Nah.<eos> See, you knew Turell had to die as much as I did.<eos> And what about his twin brother, Ty? Huh?<eos> Home on leave from Afghanistan.<eos> Shot to death in a parking lot with two other army rangers just because looked like Turell?<eos> Ty and his friends -- did they deserve to die because of what happened to Charlie Niles?<eos> Don't talk to me about Charlie Niles. Okay?<eos> You don't know nothing about Charlie Niles.<eos> I mean, in a place where you had to steal to pay for baby's diapers... He gave them away.
The DA says she wants me to testify. Do I have to?<eos> I'll look like a fool.<eos> No, no.<eos> This woman is very, very good at what she does.<eos> Any man would fall for her.<eos> The newspapers say she walked you into a trap.<eos> Claimed she had a daughter?<eos> Well, turns out that she did have a daughter.<eos> Four years ago, the child was abducted and murdered in St. Petersburg.<eos> Liev found the killers and took them out.
How did you get here?<eos> Who brought you?<eos> An old friend of mine.<eos> What friend?<eos> El Chele.<eos> What's your relationship with the fugitives?<eos> They killed him.<eos> Skinned him like an animal.<eos> So it's revenge you seek?<eos> How did you find them?
I want you to have this.<eos> You keep it.<eos> That'll get the cash out of Brazil.<eos> Make sure Laura doesn't get her hands on the accounts.<eos> Continue.<eos> The fugitives were exactly where we went.<eos> Three seminarians and four of my men died.<eos> We're going up those hills.<eos> To the Pehuenche reservation.<eos> Fresia took them there.
- What it means?<eos> - You're the Facebook generation, sir.<eos> Every candidate under 40 has some dumb photo from some dumb college buddy.<eos> Krystal Ball and the reindeer nose?<eos> - Well, she lost.<eos> ELl: Yes.<eos> But she didn't release it.<eos> You will.<eos> And my kids, my wife, seeing this.<eos> Go talk to them and make them understand.
In the beginning, there was darkness and then, bang, giving birth to an endless expanding existence of time, space and matter.<eos> Every day, new discoveries are unlocking the mysterious, the mind-blowing, the deadly secrets of a place we call the universe.<eos> Throughout its 4.5 billion-year history, our solar system has witnessed carnage on a colossal scale.<eos> Time and again, catastrophes have shattered the planetary peace.<eos> A large impact striking at the right location could have caused the whole planet to go off kilter.<eos> Worlds have collided or been paved over by runaway volcanism, or even ejected from the Sun's grasp.<eos> No planet has provided sanctuary from the solar system's reign of terror.<eos> If we have an asteroid slam in at high speed, then little bits of Mercury will go flying off the surface, and, inevitably, some of those chunks will hit Earth.<eos> So if you think Earth is a safe haven, think again.<eos> From the oldest cataclysm that rocked the planets, to the ultimate disaster that will one day blow them to oblivion. Fasten your seatbelts, as we count down the 10 greatest catastrophes that changed the planets.
During the Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact on Jupiter, you had this ripped-up comet coming in at tens of kilometers per second and impacting Jupiter in one airburst after another, as Jupiter spun underneath the comet.<eos> And so that led to a series of impacts being spread along a particular latitude of Jupiter's surface and leaving these scars, which were visible in telescopes from the Earth.<eos> The fragments didn't produce craters, because Jupiter doesn't have a solid surface.<eos> Instead, they struck the gas giant's dense atmosphere, dredging up material that erupted in a trail of venting scars.<eos> The impact scars, the dark cloud features, were about the size of our planet Earth.<eos> And that tells an important tale, that if you have an object that's a half a mile across striking an object the size of the Earth, the dust pall from that impact will encompass our entire planet.<eos> So that's the lesson we learned from the Jupiter impacts, is it really brought home the story of impacts right here on Earth.<eos> The dark imprints left on the cloud decks of Jupiter were only visible for several months, before being mixed into its turbulent atmosphere.<eos> Jupiter has very vigorous and, oftentimes, very violent weather patterns.<eos> So, no matter how destructive that airburst might be, over a period of weeks to months, the currents, the airflow in Jupiter's atmosphere, takes the pollutants and disperses them through the planet.
I'll fly Vaughn to our detention facility in Tampa tomorrow.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, where do you think you're going?<eos> See this mountain of paperwork?<eos> All of that is for your request.<eos> Y-you're gonna share my pain.<eos> You get your own pen.<eos> Most people assume that the best time to rob someone is on a dark street at night.<eos> But the fact is, a daytime heist has its advantages.<eos> Bystanders are more focused on their own business than on what's going on around them.
Detectives, he's alive!<eos> He's out there!<eos> Mr. Grey, slow down.<eos> You heard from Nico?<eos> We've been calling Nico's cell phone every five minutes, practically-- leaving tons of messages, begging him to call--<eos> Hold on. Did--did he call you back?<eos> No, listen to me.<eos> The last time my wife tried to call, it said, "mailbox full."<eos> Just now, it went straight to voice mail.<eos> He's been checking his messages, deleting them.
Come on.<eos> Please... stay.<eos> Sheldon... I will never love you back.<eos> You get that, right?<eos> It was nice to see you all.<eos> Hope to see you all again real soon when things calm down.<eos> We're in the back of the store.<eos> Dad has just given me two pennies.<eos> Two guys come in.<eos> We can hear them talking. But we don't pay attention until dad yells.
The pain is gonna stop.<eos> There's no bugs? No.<eos> Look at me, Hailey.<eos> Do you see any bugs on me?<eos> Because my skin is crawling, too.<eos> I want to rip my skin off, it is crawling so bad, but do you see any bugs on me? - No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'm gonna make you a deal.<eos> If I see any bugs on you, I'm gonna call a nurse.<eos> And if you see them on me, you do the same.

Can I feel it? Um...<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Oi, put your boner in it!<eos> I don't have a boner, Luke.<eos> I'm not like your mother.<eos> I'm gonna stick my boner in it.<eos> Oh, Laura, you are cruel.<eos> Your mum's a right whore, isn't she, Lukey? DOORBELL RINGS<eos> When I'm a mother, I'm gonna let my kids do whatever they want, because it's a free world and everybody's equal.<eos> But then if they're naughty, I'll wallop them.
Agravaine is behind this. He's done something to Gaius.<eos> Arthur told me what you said.<eos> He won't listen to me.<eos> I'll do what I can, but...<eos> Agravaine's his uncle.<eos> He trusts him more than anyone.<eos> Do not resist the fire.<eos> Let it into your mind.<eos> Let the flames search out your thoughts, feel them burn into the darkest recesses of your mind.<eos> Let them shine a torch on your deepest secrets and bring them to the light.
Now, on Earth, dust devils may only be a few hundred feet high, but on Mars, they can be 3 to 4 miles high. So they're simply immense structures.<eos> The dust devil engulfs the hab, throwing it dangerously off course.<eos> Tracking stations from Texas to Kazakhstan are following the descent, but Mars is so far away, it takes 18 minutes for the hab's transmissions to reach Earth.<eos> When the signal comes through that the hab is headed for a crash-landing, the astronauts have already crashed.<eos> But where?<eos> And are they alive or dead?<eos> There's only one thing you can do at launch, and there's only one thing you can do at landing, and that's pray.<eos> Somewhere on Mars the astronauts are alive but communications are out.<eos> They can't talk to Earth.<eos> Worse, the dust devil has taken them far off course.
They can interact with cells and harm them.<eos> Also, high-energy electromagnetic radiation like X-rays gets produced, and those can harm us as well.<eos> So it's "wham!" and then "wham!" again sometime later.<eos> Earth's magnetic field shields us from the worst effects of solar flares.<eos> But Mars lost its magnetic field 4 billion years ago.<eos> After a solar flare is seen by people on Earth, we want to warn the astronauts on Mars.<eos> Now we can't warn them about the electromagnetic flash because our warning signal would travel at the same speed as that flash from the Sun, but we can warn them about the onslaught of charged particles.<eos> The high-energy charged particles can travel, perhaps, at half the speed of light.<eos> The hab has a radiation-proof chamber, but it's now too far away.<eos> While the astronauts' space suits shielded them from the solar flare's x-rays, they have only minutes to seek shelter before the flare's high-energy second wave slams into Mars.
They're all hydrogen compounds of one form or another. And hydrogen is the most abundant element in the region of the Solar System at that point.<eos> That abundant hydrogen is combining with elements such as oxygen to form the water, or carbon to form the methane, or nitrogen to form the ammonia, and giving us those compounds, which are then freezing out.<eos> Continual collisions amid the turbulence... Make tiny specks of dust and ice stick together through friction and static electricity until they're large enough for gravity to take over.<eos> Eventually, they become planetesimals.<eos> Planetesimals were the original building box of our Solar System.<eos> They're incredibly small, only about half a mile to a mile across, but there was countless numbers in the early Solar System, it was simply littered with them.<eos> These half-mile planetesimals will eventually form full-scale planets, but of distinctly different sizes.<eos> That's what Ryan Chan of San Mateo, California wanted to ask the universe by writing...<eos> Ryan, the inner planets are smaller than the outter planets because the inner planets didn't have much material from which to be made. Just metals, and rocks and things like that.<eos> But outter planets, after forming an earthlike core, were able to attract ices of water, amonium, methane and carbon dioxide that made them get bigger, and then their gravitationally attracted gases, becoming much, much bigger.
The two bodies travel in essentially the same orbit, gradually coming closer and closer.<eos> Now, for Earth and Theia, it's crunch time.<eos> The Earth-Theia collision early in the history of the Solar System must have been a spectacular event.<eos> A Mars-sized object came in and hit Earth side splattering part of the crust and mantle of both objects into space, forming a ring of debris from which the Moon then formed.<eos> Having survived the cataclysm and gained a moon, the Earth settles in as one of the stable planets of the inner Solar System.<eos> The drama now moves back to the gas giants, whose shifting orbits threaten to tear the Solar System apart.<eos> At 500 million years old, all of the Solar System's planets have been formed.<eos> But surrounded by debris in the planetary disc, they are on the move.<eos> As waves of density formed in the disc the planets were almost surfing on the waves of material in the disc itself.<eos> You're really shuffling the deck completely from where planets are formed to where we finally see them.
Han, your mother sounds like one cold--<eos> Don't you talk about my mama!<eos> Hey, Earl.<eos> What's up?<eos> I just got threatened by a man who gets carded at Pixar movies.<eos> Max, great news-- that email blast I sent out this morning worked.<eos> I just got us a big cupcake job at some event place called the gold space loft.<eos> Last time I was at the gold space loft, I went to a poetry slam, and I wound up slamming a poet.<eos> They need 100 cupcakes by tomorrow night.<eos> And because I'm a genius, and also because it's such short notice-- but mostly because I'm a genius-- I got them up to $500.
It's brilliant it all worked out - with the cupcakes.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Well, I told Traive to hire you for the show.<eos> Johnny cannot stop talking about your cupcakes, Max.<eos> "Max's cupcakes are so moist."<eos> "Max's cupcakes are delicious."<eos> He loves your cupcakes.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> But just like in a casual way.<eos> I mean, he barely even touched them.
- Julia.<eos> Julia, it's over.<eos> - It's not over.<eos> One, two, three, four, five.<eos> They are seeds.<eos> Look, Burbuja, as if they are two euro coins, Will you stop rummaging in the poop and clean, please?<eos> Yes.<eos> Look, if he had stopped at sea, he would eat sea things... but there are neither remains of algae nor fish.<eos> Only seeds.<eos> Therefore, if he has seeds in his intestines... then he ate them recently.
I got caught up in a hostage nicoise situation. How'd it go?<eos> Did you get full price for the ring?<eos> Oh, do you know me?<eos> Because I could've sworn you didn't know me.<eos> My new friends Adin and Lablueballs. Thought it was weird that you just bailed on me.<eos> Max, I panicked in the moment.<eos> I didn't want those girls telling everyone that Caroline Channing was in a bathroom selling her jewelry.<eos> I'm barely back on my feet after the whole scandal.<eos> I just couldn't bare it.<eos> I didn't sell them because I didn't buy the whole "in it for the long haul" thing from the beginning.

Freed from what?<eos> From what?<eos> From savage capitalism, comrade.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> It will happen.<eos> Okay, so what's the plan?<eos> I want to be at the front.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Enjoy life while you can. Why risk it?<eos> When those bastards get here, we'll fix them good.
He's in the crevice.<eos> Shit, he's in the crevice?<eos> I'll come out with you.<eos> We'll go out. You and me, we'll go together.<eos> We'll have a ball.<eos> Hello?<eos> I-I'm not seeing how this relates to your weight gain.<eos> Uh, I'm telling a story, Father.<eos> Frank's not a guy that usually comes up with plans.<eos> I mean, you want to know all the key players and how success affected them, right?
That's crazy.<eos> You spoke to Massey recently?<eos> I'm not saying any more until I consult my lawyer.<eos> So, when was the last time you saw your ex-husband?<eos> Months ago.<eos> We've been divorced almost four years.<eos> You keep in touch?<eos> No reason to.<eos> Maybe if we'd had kids.<eos> I wanted them, he didn't.
- But if they're connected, - we're looking for one guy.<eos> - Oh, look at that.<eos> Beverly Jackson, the woman with the arm wound, she's finally ready to talk, so I'm going to go - talk to her.<eos> - We're not done here.<eos> I am.<eos> - I should go. Um...<eos> - Yes.<eos> Just go with Mike, see what you can dig up about Clayburn.<eos> The kids are taking it hard.<eos> That's what they call them... "Jim's Kids."
Please call me.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Please call.<eos> Finally, it looks like my fortunes are turning.<eos> You explain, it was your...<eos> Yeah, well, I felt I wasn't really pulling my weight, so I've been burning the midnight oil and went through my old law textbooks.<eos> Yeah, he studied one term of law school.<eos> Yeah I did, still got the books.<eos> That one hadn't even been opened!<eos> I read through them and I found something.
There's no record of a Peter Lattimer anywhere.<eos> I'm not getting any hits on his prints either.<eos> James says we better take him to the box.<eos> All right. Coming back.<eos> Ray, look out!<eos> Uh-uh-uh. The Leena I know is a lot nicer to her guests.<eos> Now you drop that and get over there.<eos> Now I have got to stop MacPherson.<eos> He thinks artifacts belong out in the world.<eos> So he sells them on the black market.

The Leena I know is a lot nicer to her guests.<eos> Now you drop that and get over there.<eos> Now I have got to stop MacPherson.<eos> He thinks artifacts belong out in the world.<eos> So he sells them on the black market.<eos> And I think he's used one to whammy everybody.<eos> If you think that you can single-handedly stop James MacPherson, you really are insane.<eos> Never said I was gonna do it alone.<eos> So he sells them on the black market.
Because I think I would remember something like that.<eos> Look, please, please, of everybody, I need you to listen to me, okay?<eos> I mean, you have this whole other life that nobody seems to remember but me.<eos> Maybe you should talk to somebody about that.<eos> Look, Mr.--<eos> - Agent.<eos> - Agent.<eos> - Agent Pete Lattimer.<eos> Now I've been an agent at Warehouse 13 for three years and so have you.<eos> And to keep the world safe, we track down dangerous artifacts and store them in a warehouse in South Dakota.
But how can science proof or disproof what happens in these proposed extra dimensions and whether they support or undermine the existence of a creator when we're destined to remain in our 3 dimensional world?<eos> One possibility is that we can find the effects of those other dimensions by interacting with particles that may be able to move into those other dimensions.<eos> To find matter that moves into higher dimensions scientists have built enormous accelerators that smash subatomic particles together at tremendous speeds.<eos> But these particle accelerators may soon do something else as astounding, something that seemed impossible only a few years ago.<eos> They may allow scientists to go back in time to nearly the moment our universe was created...<eos> And perhaps as some have suggested, catch a glimpse of our creator.<eos> To help determine whether God or the law of physics alone created the universe,<eos> scientists are using multibillion-dollar particle accelerators to take them in a journey back in time to nearly the moment of creation.<eos> To achieve this remarkable feat physicists send subatomic particles screaming in opposite directions around enormous oval tracks.<eos> When these tiny pieces of matter reach nearly the speed of light scientists steer them into each other.
Agh, I don't know, Haskell. They're not just clocks.<eos> They're memories.<eos> My friend, whereas these little tchotchkes symbolized the love you shared with your wife, now they are just the carcasses of a dead marriage.<eos> You need to get rid of this stuff and use the proceeds to fund an exciting new life...<eos> Minus my 20% commission for sales and handling. You know what?<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> I mean, Lorna didn't want them. Why should I?<eos> Why should you?<eos> She took our best memories and stuffed them into a box like they meant nothing.
One time there was this guy got shot by someone breaking into his house, and now he's this ghost in his old apartment.<eos> He's living there, trying to talk to his wife, but...<eos> But let me guess... there's just this one little boy who can see him.<eos> So you know the story, too?<eos> I saw the movie, actually.<eos> The Sixth Sense.<eos> Nah, it was nothing like that.<eos> I don't care what you say.<eos> I think ghosts are real.<eos> I see them all the time.
I'm too busy for luncheon at your club or anywhere else.<eos> Then I'd be happy to come to Walworth when you'd have more leisure to listen...<eos> Make an appointment with the clerks.<eos> Now you'll excuse me, I have urgent business to conduct.<eos> You really don't like me very much, do you, Mr. Wemmick?<eos> I don't know who you are.<eos> Down there.<eos> And what will happen to your property when you are dropped?<eos> Pondering your immortal soul and how you will explain yourself to the Almighty, that's all very well, but these chickens need water, grain, a coop.<eos> You're condemned but they can be saved, if you bequeath them to me.
I know, I know. Seems a little crazy.<eos> And I know this whole thing is happening really fast, but... If I don't act fast, I'll lose katy.<eos> And how many times in life do you fall in love?<eos> Well.<eos> You've done well, angel of love.<eos> Thanks to you, a newly divorced guy with low self-esteem Is gonna be dumped while down on one knee, Proposing to a prostitute.<eos> You know, I'm beginning to think I should've stayed out of this.<eos> Okay, eden, thanks for Bringing the files over.<eos> You can go now.<eos> No, I'm still arranging them.
The point is, we are now in control of the situation again, and Helen Magnus is finally out of moves.<eos> Turn that up.<eos> ...are just a smokescreen for something far more insidious.<eos> Doctor, care to elaborate?<eos> What the hell is that crazy broad doing now?<eos> I realize that what I'm about to say may sound strange, or even frightening, but I assure you every word is true.<eos> Oh, Magnus...<eos> It's time the world knew the truth.<eos> This district is full of strange beings who have lived among us for hundreds of years.<eos> I call them abnormals.

Will:<eos> Homeland... We are live on the scene of what authorities are calling the largest toxic industrial spill in recent history.<eos> When did this become a police state?<eos> It's always been a police state, Will, you just never noticed.<eos> They just turned it into a prison.<eos> Of course they have.<eos> Doc, where are you going?<eos> This district is full of strange beings who have lived among us for hundreds of years.<eos> What the hell is that crazy broad doing now?<eos> I call them abnormals.

I took this out of the trashcan since it was just being thrown away.<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> I was just joking.<eos> - Okay.<eos> No, it's not okay.<eos> Tell me what is going on.<eos> You know, the flowers that you see when you look at it. They are similar to the flowers where we come from.<eos> I was small, but I remember it a little.<eos> My sister Kiraz, though, was a baby when we came here.<eos> She never saw them, that's why.
I just wanna snort him like a diet pill!<eos> You know what? That's it.<eos> I'm having another one.<eos> (Laughs) Yeah, right.<eos> Why not?<eos> Still plenty of gumballs left in the old machine.<eos> Oh, it's so amazing having a baby in the house.<eos> They're just these little miracles filled with unconditional love. Mom!<eos> How many times do I have to ask you not to wear my sweaters?<eos> You stretched them out with your big, gross, disgusting boobs!
I've just seen it.<eos> I think I've seen it, is it an Allegro?<eos> It is.<eos> Oh, you're joking!<eos> 'Spurred on by this terrible development, 'we decided to begin our vital trade mission, 'starting with one of Bombay's most famous institutions.'<eos> Everyday an army of about 5,000 people called dabbawalas travel around the outskirts of the city collecting lunches in tins, like these ones here.<eos> They've been made by the wives of working men, and from here they are transported on foot, or by bicycle to the nearest train station.<eos> Each tin is marked with a system of symbols that tells the dabbawalas on the train where it's going.<eos> So they know which tins have to be unloaded at which station.<eos> The tins are then picked up at city centre stations by yet more dabbawalas, who bring them to the menfolk in their offices.
If you have a party, and invite the sort of great and the good, Indian commerce people, ambassadors...<eos> Oh, like a sort of ambassadorial, Ferrero Rocher type thing?<eos> Exactly that.<eos> Hello. Three adults for Jaipur, please.<eos> Where would it be?<eos> Is it in a...?<eos> What's it in? In a garden.<eos> We could have a marquee. A garden party!<eos> Come on! This is actually a good idea.<eos> It needs a focus, we're going to have all British products and our cars, and you walk around and look at them and stuff.
Then you're just going without any plans?<eos> Well, well... Becoming a formal teacher...<eos> don't you know that is really hard?<eos> The competition rate will be well past 200 to 1, you have no chance with your resume.<eos> Leaving like this means you've abandoned to teach. Does that make any sense?<eos> Is that what it means?<eos> How about your students?<eos> Don't you care about them?<eos> I care for them. More than anyone else.<eos> That is why, I am leaving them to your care.
In 1939.<eos> Only she didn't really disappear... she was killed.<eos> After she played at the Dark Score fair one day, she was raped.<eos> And then she and her little daughter, Kisha, were killed by a group of teenagers, led by the young Max Devore.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Which would explain why...<eos> Lance got interested in her music before he tried to kill Kyra.<eos> Tell me.<eos> A curse... On all the young men who killed Sara Tidwell and her little girl.<eos> With her dying breath, she cursed them all.
They don't even know him.<eos> -I think he'd love to see us.<eos> Don't you agree, kids?<eos> Then we'll go see a movie.<eos> What do mental patients do?<eos> No wonder they ask, people like that are unpredictable.<eos> People like that? ! ?<eos> What if someone attacks them?
You filthy, disgusting pervert!<eos> -There there, it's alright.<eos> This is very mysterious!<eos> I'm Margeir Orri Einarsson!<eos> I need my medication!<eos> I can't find his report.<eos> -You don't need your drugs!<eos> You've never been of any use!<eos> Always in the way!<eos> I'll tear off your limbs and feed them to the dogs!
Then that's normal.<eos> Oh, get Ra Ra.<eos> Ra Ra, come down!<eos> You're eating cookies again.<eos> Would you like some tea?<eos> Some milk.<eos> Hand it over.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm eating them.<eos> You eat them nonstop and complain about headaches and this and that ache everyday.
There'd be no meat on your tables! And your doors would be closed!<eos> I don't mean no disrespect to your father, Percy.<eos> You know that.<eos> Of course not.<eos> But you're asking me to pay.<eos> Come here, let's settle up.<eos> Come here.<eos> Hey, kid, I don't want any trouble.<eos> I'm just trying to. ..<eos> Better pick up your glasses, Doc, before someone steps on them.
He's mine.<eos> He's yours?<eos> Yeah. But the parts we're putting in him are mine!<eos> You idiots should see if he powers up before you fight over him.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Watch out.<eos> Stay back.<eos> Looks like he's got a shadow function.<eos> That's pretty rare.<eos> He can mime your movements and store them in memory.
- Let us be off, my brothers!<eos> - Hold on.<eos> Wait.<eos> Thirdly, if you place the objects on the water's surface...<eos> Oh my.<eos> Would you look at that?<eos> I hear you're burying yourself in books rather than practicing your military skills.<eos> I think I've learned enough of the martial arts from you, Grand General.<eos> I should fill up my brain now.<eos> You killed multiple men in one day and set them all on fire.
I printed these out from the Internet.<eos> This is probably him.<eos> Or it might be him.<eos> He's dressed like he was.<eos> When I magnify it until the dots are so big it stops looking like a person sometimes I can see glasses on him.<eos> Or I think I can.<eos> Probably the other kids see their dads too.<eos> This is what I want to show you.<eos> On the worst day, my dad left six messages on this answering machine.<eos> No one else has ever heard them but me.
But if it does not co lapse no member of your union will ever get a job on the John Ga t Line.<eos> Now are you going to forb d your men to run that train?<eos> I neveer used the word forb d.<eos> I'm on y stating that you cannot force anyone to take that run.<eos> I would never force a man to do anything.<eos> I'll ask for volunteers.<eos> Then it will be my problem, not yours.<eos> I'll advise them to refuse.<eos> Do what you want, Mr. Brady.<eos> But leave them the choicee.
-I know. Hey, I thought you said Fred isn't a gawker.<eos> He was standing right there.<eos> I can't let him know I know. -It'll take all the fun out of it.<eos> -Ha, ha. Oh, God, he has this stupid move where he looks back and he waits for the girl to pass so that it seems like he couldn't help but notice her ass. It's pathetic.<eos> You wanna hear a great idea?<eos> Why don't you go upstairs and slip into something uncomfortable while I give the babysitter a ride home?<eos> I want to, honey.<eos> I really do. It's after midnight and I gotta get up early with the kids.<eos> No, I'll get up with the kids.<eos> I'll take them to the park. I'll take them to Finn's birthday party.
Let's go.<eos> Little hit.<eos> Little hit. Let's go, Gerry.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Safe!<eos> I don't know how you can be so calm knowing our husbands are out chasing tail all over town.<eos> Shh, keep it down. Relax.<eos> Here's how I see it:<eos> Rick and Fred are like a couple of domesticated cats scratching at the door. -Ha, ha.<eos> -The first time you let them out they are so paralyzed with fear they bolt back into the house.
Our armies drove the Frost Giants back into the heart of their own world.<eos> The cost was great.<eos> In the end, their king fell. And the source of their power was taken from them.<eos> With the last great war ended, we withdrew from the other worlds and returned home to the realm eternal,<eos> Asgard.<eos> Here we remain as a beacon of hope, shining out across the stars.<eos> And though we have fallen into man's myths and legends, it was Asgard and its warriors that brought peace to the universe.<eos> But the day will come when one of you will have to defend that peace.<eos> Do the Frost Giants still live?<eos> When I'm king, I'lI hunt the monsters down and slay them all!
I just wanted to show you how silly his story was.<eos> But you're the one who's always pushing me to chase down every possibility, every alternative!<eos> I'm talking about science, not magic!<eos> Well, magic's just science that we don't understand yet. - Arthur C. Clarke.<eos> - Who wrote science fiction.<eos> - A precursor to science fact!<eos> - In some cases, yeah.<eos> Well, if there is an Einstein-Rosen Bridge, then there's something on the other side.<eos> And advanced beings could have crossed it!<eos> A primitive culture like the Vikings might have worshipped them as deities.
You will find him and bring him back to me.<eos> Dead or alive.<eos> Then I will teach transgressed your ways and return them back to you.<eos> Save me from blood guilt...<eos> and god who saves me and my tongue... will sing of your righteousness...<eos> in my mouth declare your prays...<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Vampire tracks are random... in sets of 2, 3 or 4 prints at a time, but these are two by two.<eos> Must have been some of the familiars.<eos> Vampires don't bring familiars in the hunt, they slow them down.
They left behind.<eos> We find the missing one, we find Lucy.<eos> I may not have seen the war... but I know the look a man gets when he likes killing.<eos> It just comes.<eos> Easy's got nothing to do with it.<eos> Give me your gun.<eos> - What?<eos> - Give me your gun.<eos> Vampires don't move like humans.<eos> Their body weight pulls them in concentric patterns.
Stop!<eos> Is it here?<eos> It's right here.<eos> Don't move!<eos> Sit still.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Kate!<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Sorry, Kate.<eos> These fellas said that you've been expecting them?
Here, come on.<eos> Here, take the food.<eos> Were your parents arrested with you?<eos> They're dead.<eos> We lived on a farm outside Warsaw.<eos> When the Russians came, they said we were kulaks and exploiting the peasants.<eos> My parents were afraid and hid me in the barn.<eos> I found them later.<eos> I--<eos> I found them face-down in the mud.
It's going to be like this everywhere.<eos> He's right.<eos> We wait till tonight.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing. Just looking.<eos> Don't look.<eos> Valka?<eos> What?<eos> Why do you have assholes tattooed on your chest?<eos> I mean, they should be on your ass so you can sit on them every time you take a shit.
Make him money and melt his ass.<eos> Just like the old days.<eos> We slaughtered men for payback.<eos> Maybe it's time for us to do our second trade?<eos> All right. I'll dig around on James and this Locust Fund, and you see what you can do about getting Winnie and me back together again.<eos> Well, I never guaranteed she'd forgive you, Gordon.<eos> Why don't we just start with her agreeing to have dinner with you first?<eos> Well, at my age, I'll take anything I can get.<eos> I had two beautiful children.<eos> And then I went away, and I didn't see them much.
Listen, I am locked in the bathroom of the honeymoon suite at Cupid's Cabin and Milo is right outside the door.<eos> You've barricaded yourself from him?<eos> That's hot.<eos> No, Mom... Okay. Focus.<eos> Room service.<eos> I hope I'm not interrupting.<eos> Dawn wanted me to make sure you got the rest of your champagne.<eos> - Great.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Your clothes are almost dry. I'll have them up in a jiffy.
These are the boys you wanted.<eos> The Clayton boys.<eos> That's right.<eos> Appear we have a little problem, Mr. Hex.<eos> There's four Clayton boys.<eos> This only three boys.<eos> I don't see my way we could possibly recompense you the agreed upon "reconception."<eos> The rest of him was too fat for my horse.<eos> Well, now, Mr. Hex these boys were no end of trouble to us simple folk.<eos> You showed me proof they was guilty. I brought them in, simple as that.
I'm helping herwith her passport application.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'll just finish up.<eos> So if you'll just...<eos> Yes.<eos> Lock up when you go.<eos> I needed to see Shanghai through Conner's eyes.<eos> The only port in the world that would take in 20,000 Jews on the run from Hitler as the Japanese and the Chinese were engaged in street warfare.<eos> Dead bodies piled up.<eos> Westerners walked over them and went about their business.
Drink tea with the wives, try to understand their English?<eos> I wish you'd told me you were coming.<eos> I would have cancelled my dinner plans.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's this?<eos> It's not what you think it is.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> No.<eos> I've put Karl through hell these past weeks.<eos> Men always seem to notice when you're not in love with them any more.
The I. r.a. and sinn fein have a choice between negotiations and violence.<eos> My message to sinn fein is clear:<eos> The settlement train is leaving.<eos> I want you on that train, but it is leaving anyway.<eos> And I will not allow it to wait for you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> The search for peace in northern ireland was dealt a devastating blow today when the ira murdered two police officers.<eos> Two ira gunmen caught them in a side street.<eos> It's believed they came up behind them and fired a number of shots into their heads at close range.
The people over here, they just don't get that.<eos> All they want to know is, is this a war america should be fighting?<eos> If we do go in, bomb the hell out of milosevic, what happens if all we wind up doing is pissing him off and he ramps up his assault on kosovo?<eos> We don't even have a grantee, if nato does go in, air strikes are going to do any go.<eos> How long are you going to keep going arou on this?<eos> Til you tell me it's the right thing to do.<eos> It's the right thing to do and you don't need me to tell you that.<eos> No.<eos> But it sure does make me feel better hearing you say it.<eos> the serbs say they shot several dozen terrorists in uniform, but these men wear no uniform and receive no hearing from the police who separated them...
I'll handle it.<eos> Remember!<eos> To achieve greatness, everyone is expendable!<eos> One needs to be committed absolutely.<eos> If fire turtles are found in the Monastery, then the Chaplain has to be involved.<eos> But what's the Chaplain's murder motive?<eos> Both men moved the amulets before they died.<eos> I don't believe in divine intervention, but there might be a clue behind the amulets.<eos> Xue moved it during investigation<eos> Jia moved them while inspecting the tubular pillar. I think during his inspection,
What are you up to at the moment? I'm just relaxing.<eos> I stay at home.<eos> My agent is bringing some scripts to me to read.<eos> You're a boss, huh?<eos> You see?<eos> Huh?<eos> Who's the fool now? Huh?<eos> They'll get them for £50 each.<eos> You've finally made something properly.<eos> But I'll tell Chavo I sold them for £20...
What does this mean?<eos> The Queen in Africa?<eos> Absurd!<eos> They gave them some scarecrow.<eos> Tato used look-alike models too.<eos> Vikil is a complete crock.<eos> He'll never be able to find any sponsors again.<eos> Vikil...<eos> What about the pyroman?<eos> Who brought them here?
Come on in.<eos> I'm having a bit of a problem with your performance lately.<eos> It's too good. Gee.<eos> For a moment there-- threw you, huh?<eos> Mm.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Now, orchids I can deal with, But bonsais are so, uh, touchy.<eos> May I?<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah, you're killing them with kindness.
Hands?<eos> Nether wanted Clarity?<eos> Oh, he could have it.<eos> Joshua nether, a walking, talking, Sexual harassment machine.<eos> Like they said in rome, Live by the sword, die by the sword.<eos> Nether would never know what hit him.<eos> I had his number All of his numbers.<eos> Social security number,<eos> Mother's birthday, and password.<eos> I took the funds he controlled for Clarity And transferred them to accounts I'd created.
We need to hear you say it.<eos> After she tried to kill herself the first time,<eos> Dolores told me she... she had an insect... living inside her brain.<eos> She could feel it... clicking across her skull just... pulling the wires just for fun.<eos> She told me that.<eos> She told me that, but I didn't listen.<eos> I loved her so much, you know.<eos> Why did you make them up?<eos> Because I can't take knowing that Dolores killed our children.<eos> And I... I killed them 'cause I didn't get her help, you know.
That's what we are just talking about.<eos> Its a strange deal.<eos> All the ID's we found on them... bogus!<eos> All of them?<eos> Yeah, but not the usual internet garbage.<eos> ...real high quality stuff.<eos> I honestly felt they were the real deal til I ran them.<eos> I want you to take a look at pretty boy over here.<eos> Here's something you might find interesting.<eos> They dug them out of his shoulder.
Well, 'I think anybody want to drink a little 'coffee'.<eos> Margot, come with me.<eos> Of the 'we will be saved.<eos> Governor Engler will sign ' a contract between a couple of months.<eos> For those who commit 'suicide seen, the penalty will be 'of 4 years.<eos> - It 's absurd.<eos> - It 's a fucking joke.<eos> But when will 'the moment thou must 'be ready.<eos> We would not be fortunate if we found those wholesalers Calamasu.<eos> It 'came out that my old flame them work '.
Some of the bills might be marked.<eos> Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky.<eos> So, they used C-4 to knock out the elevators.<eos> Residue's being sent to the lab now.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Automatic weapons, precision timing.<eos> Shape charges.<eos> Degree of difficulty is off the charts.<eos> They were hot shit, no doubt about that.<eos> It'll make it that much sweeter when we take them down.
There's nothing you and Patty can do?<eos> There's one possible witness, but Patty doesn't think we have enough leverage to approach her.<eos> What do you think?<eos> You guys go right in.<eos> Why don't you get to work?<eos> Maybe you'll accomplish something today.<eos> What was that about?<eos> He's pissed because I haven't been able to link the Tobins to Marcetti's death.<eos> - Those guys looked like detectives.<eos> - Gates is reinterviewing them.
I told you to stop!<eos> I told you...<eos> Maybe, you know, we could figure this out, you know, together.<eos> I don't think I'm in the right state of mind to help you right now.<eos> You have one new message.<eos> I told you not to go through with it!<eos> I told you to stop!<eos> Hello?<eos> If you haven't found the documents by now, they're in your bag.<eos> I wanted you to have them.
He's a good egg.<eos> I helped him; he helped me.<eos> Helped how?<eos> Well, that's not for publication.<eos> Oh, so you... keeping secrets?<eos> Girls have secrets.<eos> You left Tommy in the dumpster, didn't you?<eos> Louis Tobin's boots.<eos> Where did you get those?<eos> Our residentially challenged friend found them in the same dumpster he found the phone.
You give me the rights to your book... you've got yourself a pitchman for your foundation.<eos> You would do the commercials... and the Webisodes, the PSA's?<eos> As many as you want.<eos> Well, I suppose if we can both help each other out.<eos> We absolutely can.<eos> I have to say I'm intrigued...<eos> Yeah!<eos> Louis Tobin's boots, Danielle Marchetti's phone.<eos> Where did you get those?<eos> At some point, someone threw the boots and the phone into a Dumpster, and Barry found them.
Thanks.<eos> Lot of help.<eos> I only cancelled it because you were lying to me about the drugs.<eos> What's gonna happen now?<eos> Am I going to jail?<eos> - Probably. Yes.<eos> - Will you be my lawyer?<eos> I can't.<eos> I work for the D.A.<eos> We prosecute drug offenders, we don't defend them.
Pull over real quick.<eos> I got to show sammy something.<eos> Sammy, grab your sneakers.<eos> What are we doing? What do you mean?<eos> Why do I need my shoes?<eos> What happens next can only be described as tragic.<eos> And the sons of aaron, nadav and avihu,<eos> Each took his fire pan, placed within it fire, And placed incense upon it.<eos> And they offered a strange fire before hashem, One that he did not command of them,<eos> And the fire came forth before hashem and devoured them, And they died before hashem.
So in an oversaturated market place which names garner the most attention?<eos> Are some names destined for the top self, while the others are headed for the bargain basement?<eos> Let's take a look at the two product lines<eos> Turns out, there is a such a thing as a knock off name<eos> The top 5 middle class white girls names from Fryer's studies are: (in order of popularity)<eos> While the top 5 lower income white girls names are:<eos> So what happens to Ashleys? !<eos> She's fast loosing popularity in the middle class list<eos> But she's no.1 in the WalMart crowd<eos> As those wealthier folks see their names popping up everywhere they quickly discard them in favor of less merchandise
Remember what I said at the dinner?<eos> How do we ensure the greatest profit at the lowest risk?<eos> So my suggestion is this:<eos> Go under your mattresses, find all the money you can liquefy everything and put it all on the Colombian.<eos> Do this and you will leave here richer men than ever you could've dreamed.<eos> - What about our fighters?<eos> - Fuck your fighters.<eos> Fuck our fighters?<eos> They're the weak horses.<eos> We put them down with the rest.
It's me.<eos> I expected you tomorrow I was in the area and...<eos> Come in.<eos> Thanks for the help with the kids I was thinking I could take them now...<eos> Quiet.<eos> The kids are asleep.<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> That you were at your brother's.<eos> Something about your work..<eos> I'll pick them up in the morning before they go to school, OK?
Among your attackers, one was trying not to kill you.<eos> He fired high and slightly to your left.<eos> A bad shot.<eos> He hit an area the size of an orange.<eos> He aimed to one side on purpose.<eos> Of the five gunmen, only he missed.<eos> Five gunmen?<eos> Eight in all.<eos> A lookout, two drivers, five gunmen.<eos> I didn't count them.
Sophie.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Why are you shouting?<eos> - There's something on the roof.<eos> Some birds maybe, or the neighbours' cat.<eos> They don't have a cat.<eos> - Yes, St. Nicholas just gave them one.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> - Why?<eos> Jasper said St. Nicholas puts the naughty children in his sack and takes them to Spain. - Great.
They gave them orders:<eos> "Don't talk, just shoot."<eos> I was here at my mother's house and my son was with me.<eos> And I left him with my mother to go home for my wife.<eos> I began to run and they ran after me.<eos> And I heard the white men again,<eos> "Catch him!<eos> Catch him!"<eos> But I ran faster and hid behind some bushes.<eos> And all around me... I heard them kill people.
Jesus, Jesse.<eos> -What the hell are you doing here?<eos> -Are you gonna let me in?<eos> Yeah, come in.<eos> All right, I know I've been an asshole and I've been jealous and I've been fucked up.<eos> But Dean was my friend too.<eos> Will you please tell me what's been going on?<eos> I'm having these dreams.<eos> And I'm scared.<eos> I think Dean was having them too.
I'm telling you, she'll take him for everything he's worth, and then leave him pouring his heart out to some barman.<eos> No, he's a big boy.<eos> She'll put a charge in his battery. Maybe she'll give him that son he always wanted.<eos> How infuriating will it be if he has his second family before I have my first.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> You know, you looked really pretty tonight?<eos> Are those earrings new?<eos> -These?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> I wear them every day.
- DH Marks, you are the absolute limit. - Don't panic.<eos> We just got some coordinates.<eos> We have latitude North 063504.<eos> Longitude, we have West 1525302.<eos> - Ernie.<eos> - ¿Cómo està?<eos> Hey!<eos> - Ernie boy.<eos> I just got tickets for this play tonight.<eos> I just got them right now. - It's the first, you know.
A magnificent weapon, there's no other like it.<eos> Powder guns have no future.<eos> I was looking forward to meeting you, Lope.<eos> Claudio speaks highly of your talent.<eos> He's my friend, he exaggerates.<eos> I've heard you were a soldier.<eos> Try it.<eos> I favor swords.<eos> And verses.<eos> Everyone recites them.
Do you think she will give in?<eos> I hope not. Or he'll be done with me.<eos> Once he wins her over, there'll be no more verses.<eos> That's how men are. Gifts and verses until you get what you want.<eos> -Then... -Not me.<eos> I've filled Madrid with verses dedicated to you.<eos> Love is so surprising, since I met you...<eos> I can't stay away.<eos> I gave you my soul, now I'm a prisoner of my body.<eos> Everyone recites them, though they ignore who I wrote them for.
- Mona Gray.<eos> - Mona Gray, will you please get out?<eos> - Should I call the police?<eos> - No. - But you need your numbers.<eos> How are you gonna know how you feel or who you are without them?<eos> - Andrea, I'll be right back.<eos> - So why don't you need your numbers anymore?<eos> - Why do you care? - I care because you're the reason I love math.<eos> You taught me numbers were everything.<eos> And I noticed your numbers, and I used to keep a vertical bar graph measuring them against your moods.
Oh.<eos> My beak.<eos> Da.<eos> Okay.<eos> Enough, young owlets. Time for bed.<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Enough stories about the Guardians.<eos> Now, Kludd, stories are part of our culture and our history.<eos> We learn from them.<eos> Even after the 700th time we hear them?
- It's your first pellet.<eos> First?<eos> You mean there'll be more?<eos> Don't you recognize it, Eg?<eos> It was the mouse you ate.<eos> Its fur and bones, anyway.<eos> Every owl yarps up pellets.<eos> In fact, I think I might have your brothers' first pellets.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - Maybe you'd like to see them?
A head doctor?<eos> Do you know where she liked to go?<eos> Maybe some place unusual?<eos> Someplace she normally wouldn't be found dead in? She's sick?<eos> I mean, mentally?<eos> You're gonna fix her, right?<eos> You better!<eos> Try to think of a place she might go when she wasn't acting like herself.<eos> We like to call our servants "staff."<eos> Quite often, we would treat them like family.
A lawyer to see about getting out of her...<eos> What was the name of the lawyer?<eos> - Sampson...<eos> Sanderman.<eos> - Sanderman.<eos> Anyway, said nobody could help her.<eos> Whistleblowers always sound like psychos.<eos> And I didn't get back to her.<eos> So she helped out these Night Flower assholes.<eos> She got them in through the cooling tunnels.
-That's all right.<eos> Of course, everything he does is all right, isn't it?<eos> Hey, you scuffed those boots!<eos> Ignore her, she's drunk.<eos> Still, my reactions will be quicker now I've rested.<eos> In case anything happens, I can stay up with you.<eos> -We can take it in turns.<eos> -Fantastic, the two musketeers.<eos> TONY: Hey, what are you doing?<eos> -Putting them out to be cleaned.
- I was assaulted.<eos> - Hey, it's okay.<eos> I'm a sheriff.<eos> You're safe.<eos> Now tell me what happened.<eos> These four men- there were four men and they broke into my cabin.<eos> And they had a gun and they assaulted me.<eos> Did you get a nice look at them?<eos> Can you ID 'em?<eos> Yes, I'd seen them.
They wouldn't let me in unless I was family.<eos> - Some things for the kids.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Sleeping, huh?<eos> Hey, thanks for coming.<eos> I'm a scientist.<eos> Gotta track the experiment.<eos> I wish your enzyme was the one that passed the test.<eos> But the one the kids are getting, it's the right one, right?<eos> I mean... It's gonna help them.
I'm Abra Rice.<eos> Oh, yeah, well...<eos> Okay, now you're starting to hurt my feelings.<eos> What?<eos> We're gonna be friends 'cause we're the only ones in class who've been through puberty.<eos> I'm just...<eos> I'm really busy.<eos> Okay, I'll start.<eos> So, I got these lefty parents and they're always telling me I should put my big mouth to good use and try to change the system.<eos> So, I ignored them, of course.
How can you say that Nihad of May is the son of Nawal Marwan?<eos> My brother was placed at the Kfar Khout orphanage.<eos> We found the birth records.<eos> The dates, everything fits.<eos> Nihad of May is my brother.<eos> My friends and I attacked the Christians of Kfar Khout, to avenge the aggressions against our brother refugees.<eos> There was an orphanage in Kfar Khout.<eos> I spared the children and I took them with us.<eos> Nihad was among them.<eos> We trained them, prepared them to fight alongside us.
Is Mr. Harris going to die?<eos> No, Sally.<eos> He is going to be okay.<eos> Can I show you something?<eos> This is my favorite part of the house.<eos> Blackwood loved nature.<eos> He imported these fish from Japan. And so did we.<eos> They're called koi.<eos> They're considered magical.<eos> Badgers can spot them against the mud at the bottom because of their bright colors.

Both of them, their bodies were right here.<eos> Shh, it's okay.<eos> Are you happy now?<eos> Hey, I'm just trying to help.<eos> Look, I'm sure they were here, but, look, there's nothing here now!<eos> They were right there.<eos> Well then, maybe... maybe it was a different shed.<eos> - Maybe you were just scared.<eos> - No, I know what I saw.<eos> I saw them with my own eyes.
I'm in the Celopecka street, no 7.<eos> Milos!<eos> Hey, baby, where you headin' for?<eos> Out naked, but won't take a dick?<eos> Be polite, the girl is underage.<eos> So what if I am underage?<eos> Look at this jerk!<eos> No, Rasa, don't.<eos> Rare kind of Monks put seven adult he-goats into a shed during summer.<eos> They leave them for a month until their balls are like mellons.
And what if they married?<eos> No idea.<eos> Mama, Ian Devan gives bacon.<eos> That is wrong.<eos> - Why?<eos> Bob Ho.<eos> - Hi.<eos> And how are the kids?<eos> - I go picnicking with them.<eos> I force them to like me.
Mission accomplished.<eos> Come here.<eos> You look so beautiful.<eos> I did not know you did gymnastics.<eos> - Why?<eos> You know nothing about me.<eos> You go and you talk Gillian Never us.<eos> Come on.<eos> The woman has a point.<eos> I do not know who you are to send out my clothes. I want them killed.
Your security is important.<eos> I thought I was my other life could forget, but I can not.<eos> Be happy.<eos> You're lucky you This family is not together.<eos> You have no idea what it is like you live where you do not belong.<eos> Do not be sure.<eos> I grew up an orphanage.<eos> I never knew my parents, but I had a family.<eos> I had numerous brothers and sisters. Without some kinship.<eos> But I loved them all.
My brave spirit!<eos> Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil would not infect his reason?<eos> Not a soul but felt a fever of the mad and play'd some tricks of desperation<eos> The king's son Ferdinand, with hair up-staring was the first man that leap'd cried; Hell is empty and all the devils here!<eos> Why that's my spirit!<eos> But was not this nigh shore?<eos> - Close by, my master<eos> - But are they, Ariel, safe?<eos> Not a hair perish'd<eos> On their sustaining garments not a blemish but fresher than before and, as thou badest me, in troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle
As if it had lungs, and rotten ones<eos> Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen<eos> Here is everything advantageous to life<eos> True: save means to live<eos> Of that there's none, or little<eos> How lush and lusty the grass looks!<eos> How green!<eos> The ground indeed is tawny<eos> With an eye of green in't<eos> But the rarity of it is, which is indeed almost beyond credit that our garments, being, as they were, drenched in the sea are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric
Will you laugh me asleep?<eos> I am very heavy<eos> Go sleep, and hear us<eos> What, so soon asleep?<eos> I wish mine eyes would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts I find they are inclined to do so<eos> Do not omit the heavy offer of it It seldom visits sorrow when it doth, it is a comforter<eos> We two, my lord, will guard your person while you take your rest and watch your safety<eos> Thank you!<eos> Wondrous heavy<eos> What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
If you be pleased, retire into my cell and there repose a turn or two I'll walk, to still my beating mind<eos> We wish your peace<eos> Come with a thought!<eos> I thank thee, Ariel.<eos> What's thy pleasure?<eos> Spirit. We must prepare to meet with Caliban<eos> Ay, my commander<eos> Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?<eos> I told you, ma'am, they were red-hot with drinking<eos> I left them I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake outstunk their feet
In this last tempest<eos> But, howsoe'er you have been justled from your senses know for certain that I am Prospera<eos> Welcome, sir This cell's my court<eos> I pray you, look in<eos> Sweet lord, you play me false<eos> No, my dear'st love, I would not for the world<eos> Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle and I would call it, fair play<eos> If this prove a vision of the island, one dear son shall I twice lose<eos> Though the seas threaten, they are merciful<eos> I have cursed them without cause
No, ma'am.<eos> Do you have any Jell-O or yogurt?<eos> In the cooler.<eos> Right behind you, darling.<eos> By eating the weaker and slower ones, lions keep the antelope population strong and in proper proportion to all other animals.<eos> Light.<eos> Shadow.<eos> Reflections on puddle.<eos> I've eaten bulls' testicles!<eos> Ate them in my aunt's ranch.
You know that.<eos> Right between the eyes.<eos> Man, I would slit my throat rather than say something to someone that you didn't want me to say.<eos> - But that is comforting.<eos> - That's how I am, how I roll.<eos> That's how I do, as they say.<eos> - I like the pants.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> They're Costco.<eos> You can have them when you get taller.
You and I are going together. All right?<eos> You have to do everything I say and tell everyone that I am sensational.<eos> - Thank you so much for doing this.<eos> - Just you know, make sure you're ready to live with the consequences.<eos> - What the hell is a lemon squeeze?<eos> - It's like a backwards melon bag.<eos> How don't I know any of this?<eos> The next night was the party at Melody Bostic's house.<eos> She is the most popular girl in school.<eos> It's partly because she's pretty and has perfect hair but mostly because her parents let her have these parties every time she catches them doing it in the pool which is every week, apparently.
You look good in it.<eos> You can keep it if you want.<eos> - Have you lost something?<eos> - My Iocket.<eos> The chain must be broken. It must be here.<eos> We're going to look in the morning.<eos> No, I've got to find it now.<eos> My parents will kill me otherwise.<eos> - They'II understand for sure.<eos> - You don't know them.
You don't need to lie.<eos> Was there any reason why on this particular night she might have wanted to use heroin?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Why maybe?<eos> I broke up with her.<eos> - That night?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So to some extent you feel responsible for Nicole's death.<eos> I don't know, maybe to an extent.<eos> But you want your uncles put away for it, even though you didn't see them do it and she was justifiably upset on this night because you had ended the relationship.
Come down here.<eos> Why were you hiding in the trees?<eos> This is my home. I live here.<eos> That's my house.<eos> You live in a tree?<eos> Sure do.<eos> So you're a tree hugger?<eos> You could put it that way.<eos> I love trees. They're my family.<eos> I look out for them and protect these precious redwoods.
All hail Lilliput!<eos> All hail Lilliput!<eos> You are herewith charged with aiding our sworn enemy, the Blefuscians.<eos> You are my prisoner, and shall be presented to our Royal Highness, King Theodore.<eos> What say you... beast?<eos> You are not real!<eos> Where is my...?<eos> Where am I?<eos> This must be a dream.<eos> I'm gonna close my eyes, then I'm gonna open them, and I'll be home in bed.
Yeah... yeah.<eos> I told everybody that you were my girlfriend.<eos> It's really embarrassing.<eos> I think it's kind of sweet.<eos> We must focus because we have to book... to the boat and get out of here.<eos> We're surrounded by little people.<eos> Darcy, listen to me.<eos> I would love to book with you over to the boat right now, but I can't.<eos> These little people have grown very large in my heart.<eos> They depended on me... and I let them down.
It's not important.<eos> Look, I finish my exams in a couple of days.<eos> Let's meet up and talk about it, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Can you get a move on with those carrots?<eos> Mmm. This is going to be yummy.<eos> How long has it been since we last cooked together?<eos> Hmm? You loved to help me out when you were a kid.<eos> Making cookies was your favorite thing.<eos> You used to eat half of them before they'd cool down.
It is impossible to know.<eos> Where is my uncle?<eos> I'm sorry, Emma.<eos> I'm afraid Christopher didn't wait for God to pass judgment on his mistakes.<eos> What Father Taylor did is unforgivable.<eos> But you may be sure that God will make him pay for it.<eos> And the tapes?<eos> They are in a safe place.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> No one will ever see them.
Move it. Move it, come on.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Sweep the roof.<eos> The picture might be distorted.<eos> The building has scramblers.<eos> Copy that.<eos> We'll circle the roof.<eos> Hang on, sir. Can you see this?<eos> Get as close as you can, but do not land until we get a good look at them.
If it comes.<eos> Leary to 555.<eos> On scene, entering back door.<eos> Police department!<eos> Open up!<eos> Clear.<eos> Clear.<eos> Call Forensics.<eos> Let's send in the medics.<eos> My SWAT team can defend them.
Maria was creating an army?<eos> They were very common in the South.<eos> And cost a brutal battles for territory.<eos> Maria won them all.<eos> She was smart, careful.<eos> And she had me.<eos> I was the second in command.<eos> My abilities to control emotions served her well.<eos> I trained her newborns.<eos> An endless occupation since she never let them live beyond their first year.
20 years, I've waited.<eos> Felt more like a thousand.<eos> What are you gonna do with that, girl?<eos> Make us all a sandwich?<eos> Stay away from him.<eos> It's not him I'm interested in.<eos> It's me, isn't it?<eos> 'Cause I saw what you did to those kids.<eos> They drove me to it.<eos> So you shot them, and you sank them into the mud.
The greenhouse.<eos> Let me show you something else.<eos> I found this in here earlier.<eos> It chronicles the history of the house.<eos> According to this,<eos> Delacroix made his slaves bury the bodies of their dead relatives in the foundation and the walls.<eos> Looks like it was a way to build psychic capacity.<eos> He found a way to store and generate psychic energy, and then the other owners, he influenced them.<eos> Influenced them?<eos> Or possessed them?
No, Tom.<eos> We take it to the well, and this ends, Greg.<eos> We don't know that for sure.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You know, before you came along, this was a real cushy job... no real ghosts, just us shooting grainy footage of us scaring ourselves.<eos> First show with you on board and we got two dead people.<eos> Bub may not be dead.<eos> Well, he might as well be!<eos> The other caretakers, they figured this out.<eos> If they keep the house fed, it lets them go about their business, and I say we do the same.
Police advices that Taylor is extremely dangerous and should not be approached.<eos> In other news, the Commissioner of police corruption availed his plan..<eos> Sit down.<eos> Sit down!<eos> I don't mind if you smoke.<eos> Do you mind if I smoke?<eos> You can't kill me, I'm having a dinner party.<eos> I will cut your throat, put you in the bathtub, I'll eat all your food.. and I'll sleep in your bed.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> I want you to get on the phone. I want you to call your homo friends and tell them to fuck off.
Let's go!<eos> Don't talk to her right here.<eos> You lied.<eos> I have nothing to say...<eos> Stop following me!<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> Go and help out now.<eos> Miss Holly<eos> What's the matter?<eos> When the three robbers were sent to the hospital today for a medical checkup, they kept saying that Superman beat them up.
You go now.<eos> - Elias.<eos> Hi, sweetheart.<eos> - Hi, dad.<eos> Good to see you, my boy.<eos> Did we talk about calling each other today?<eos> I just wanted to talk to you.<eos> I've have such a busy day. I couldn't remember if we - planned to talk today.<eos> You know Christian? His granddad died a long time ago, and left some fireworks in the barn.<eos> Nobody found them.
- Are you in paradise, bro?<eos> - No, bro.<eos> - I'm in a cafe.<eos> Where are you?<eos> - I'm in a kebab shop.<eos> I've got hostages and everything, like Xbox Counter-Strike.<eos> - Right, listen, Waj.<eos> You've got to...<eos> - Thing is, they're all brothers.<eos> I still get points for taking them with me, though, yeah?
Go.<eos> Where is-- where's my re-entry stub?<eos> I had it.<eos> Did you take it?<eos> Did I hand it to you? - No.<eos> - l must have handed it to you.<eos> No, you didn't, father!<eos> For heaven's sake, try to remember where you put things!<eos> Did you check your pants?<eos> - l'm wearing them!
We create and perceive our world simultaneously.<eos> And our mind does this so well that we don't even know it's happening.<eos> That allows us to get right in the middle of that process.<eos> - How?<eos> - By taking over the creating part.<eos> Now, this is where I need you.<eos> You create the world of the dream.<eos> We bring the subject into that dream, and they fill it with their subconscious.<eos> How could I ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it's reality?<eos> Well, dreams, they feel real while we're in them, right?
- Okay.<eos> We're gonna talk about this.<eos> All right?<eos> - I'm asking you to take a leap of faith.<eos> - No, honey.<eos> No, I can't. You know I can't do that.<eos> Take a second, think about our children.<eos> Think about James.<eos> Think about Phillipa, now.<eos> If I go without you, they'll take them away anyway.
I know what's real, Mal.<eos> No creeping doubts?<eos> Not feeling persecuted, Dom?<eos> Chased around the globe by anonymous corporations and police forces the way the projections persecute the dreamer?<eos> Admit it.<eos> You don't believe in one reality anymore.<eos> So choose.<eos> Choose to be here.<eos> Choose me.<eos> You know what I have to do. I have to get back to our children because you left them.
Choose to be here.<eos> Choose me.<eos> You know what I have to do. I have to get back to our children because you left them.<eos> Because you left us.<eos> - You're wrong.<eos> - I'm not wrong.<eos> You're confused.<eos> Our children are here.<eos> And you'd like to see their faces again, wouldn't you?<eos> Yes, but I'm gonna see them up above, Mal.
We need ashes.<eos> Ashes don't say how many of them there were.<eos> They don't say if they were men, women or children.<eos> Goodness, Wagner is so depressing!<eos> Can't we change the music?<eos> Who wants a cocktail?<eos> Moi, moi, moi!<eos> Eva, you know what I think of women drinking alcohol.<eos> I don't drink, mein Führer.<eos> I just think up cocktails and test them on Dr. Morell.
I am 11 years old and my phone better than you.<eos> Poor fool.<eos> Tongue cut off.<eos> This is something important for Latino gangs.<eos> Take you to the tongue You can confess your sins Jesus in khirat<eos> Where are these people?<eos> Salvador?<eos> Honduras?<eos> "Rudels.<eos> This makes them Mexican.
Hey you monkeys!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Hands up.<eos> Special Forces zip line<eos> These guys are pros<eos> You're thinking what I'm thinking, partner?<eos> - Aim for the bushes.<eos> Cops still argue to this day why Danson and Highsmith jump<eos> Maybe it was just pride having survived so many brushes with death.<eos> Maybe their ego pushed them off.
Ooh...<eos> What is this place?<eos> Divining is most effective at sunset.<eos> We will perform it once a day.<eos> I'll summon the bird, you say the words and perform the sacrifice, just like I told you.<eos> You reach out with your heart and you read the map.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - it's a slow, steady method.<eos> She can't block us unless she gets her hand on one of the sacrifices.<eos> We will find them this way.
Here's the deal.<eos> There's no evidence for psychiatric causes or neurological problems.<eos> Your MRI is fine.<eos> I think the symptoms you're describing are consistent with past life trauma.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's where memories from a past life come up to the surface and make you sick.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Can you help him?<eos> The treatment that we recommend is regression therapy.<eos> Basically, we go back, we see where the memories are coming from, What's causing them. If we can locate the triggers, we can usually make it stop.
Why, sweetheart?<eos> I don't know. Just did.<eos> You want me to turn on the light for you?<eos> Why, do I look like I'm sitting in the dark here?<eos> I don't know. Maybe a little.<eos> Maybe I need new glasses.<eos> Actually, I don't even know if these are mine.<eos> Whose are they?<eos> Geez, I don't know.<eos> Well, can you see better with them?
Daughter of Frank Ross.<eos> Aw, tragic thing.<eos> May I say, your father impressed me with his manly qualities.<eos> He was a close trader, but he acted the gentleman.<eos> I propose to sell those ponies back to you that my father bought.<eos> Well that I fear, is out of the question.<eos> I will see that they are shipped to you at my earliest convenience.<eos> We don't want the ponies now. We don't need them.<eos> Well, that hardly concerns me.<eos> Your father bought the ponies and paid for them, and there's the end of it.
White Mike and his father moved after his mother died of breast cancer. It ate her up- and most of their money.<eos> They can't control the old radiators, and it's very hot in springtime.<eos> In White Mike's room, old unpacked boxes stick out of the closet... so he can see them.
You wanna put us in the hole for a wall that'd serve the same purpose if it was stucco.<eos> I wasn't paid to do stucco, Sean.<eos> You look cheap, you are cheap.<eos> Excuse me, Rebecca?<eos> That's your name, right?<eos> What's with these skylights?<eos> They're half the size that I told you to make them.<eos> - Hi, hon.<eos> - Hi.<eos> REBECCA: I downsized them.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> - No, you can't blame this on him.<eos> - I'm sorry. CHRISTIAN: You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> DAN:<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Come on, let's get you some stitches.<eos> Next time you're being chased through campus by an angry professor wear pants. CHRISTIAN:<eos> How could I?<eos> I think his wife broke the zipper when she ripped them off me.
-Please.<eos> For me.<eos> I can't...<eos> Please.<eos> For me.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep 's clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.<eos> Ye shall know them by their fruits.
This is nothing!"<eos> That's what's wrong With our kids. They can't just stand And be a person without-<eos> And then the food-<eos> We feed them food That tastes like insanity.<eos> It's insanity, our food.<eos> Do you under-you should To be able to give a kid An apple, and they go, "Oh, thank you.<eos> I love apples. "<eos> Kids can't even taste-<eos> Apples are like paper to them.<eos> Because we fill 'em, We force them to eat-
Because we fill 'em, We force them to eat-<eos> People force their kids To eat fast food.<eos> I was in this hamburger- This woman's, like, just Shoving french fries in the-<eos> "Eat it!"<eos> The kid's, like, "Mom, it's salty.<eos> It hurts. I can't eat anymore. "<eos> "Shut up.<eos> We give them msg, Sugar, and caffeine, And, weirdly, They react to those chemicals.<eos> And so they yell, "aah. "<eos> And then we hit them.
I get mine from the UN.<eos> But any kind will do, except Blackjacks.<eos> Condoms can stop HIV AIDS spread.<eos> If my mother and father had one, maybe then they would still be here.<eos> So please, be safe sexing.<eos> In football world, Didier Drogba says, "Football is better than sex."<eos> So make football, not war.<eos> This bit takes time.<eos> Let me tell you some of the famous people that wear condoms.<eos> First of all, all the players in the World Cup will be wearing them.
The bitch wants to give the money back.<eos> What an example to Africa's children!<eos> You got what you came for.<eos> Now leave us alone.<eos> Hey, George.<eos> Have you told them about what you did to the village in Bakundo?<eos> That was when I knew you were a soldier, my brother.<eos> The little ones trapped, crying, "Help me!<eos> Help me!"<eos> Remember them, Foreman George?
But I don't want to spend too much money because I'm going to get myself a little car.<eos> - Are you?<eos> - Yeah, I've decided it's about time.<eos> - It's a big step. - I know.<eos> It's exciting, isn't it?<eos> I mean, I've got a little bit of money.<eos> Not a lot, but enough.<eos> But I'll have to cut back on, you know, shoes, clothes, jewellery, my knick-knacky things.<eos> But that's OK because I've got loads of clothes. My wardrobe isn't big enough.<eos> In fact, I'm not doing anything this weekend, so I'll get up really early, sort my winter clothes into plastic bags and shove them under the bed.
- Katie, lovely to see you.<eos> - Ahh, lovely to see you.<eos> - How are you? - Fine.<eos> Mary's here.<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Aha!<eos> - We brought you some chocolates. - Good.<eos> Ha-ha!<eos> - Oh, no, give them back!<eos> - You'll never see them again.
Get the same feeling every year, like someone's twisting a knife inside me.<eos> So, normally I stay inside on that day and I draw the blinds and I let the phone ring.<eos> I was married, you know.<eos> I've got three kids.<eos> I never knew what was wrong with me.<eos> You know, I'd think about my mother all the time, but I could never talk about it.<eos> How can you talk about someone when you've been told they don't even exist?<eos> I went to see this doctor.<eos> He put me on antidepressants.<eos> That didn't really help, so I saved them up,

Why is there light?<eos> Because there is darkness.<eos> LIKE THAT<eos> Money was invented so that the people wouldn't have to look each other in the eye.<eos> So, we're back to zero, my friend.<eos> Fortunately, the Arabs have invented it.<eos> We don't even pay them for their copyright.<eos> Negative numbers were invented in India.<eos> They made some in Arabia, before setting out for Italy.<eos> Fibonacci has used them first.
There won't be... a Justice Escorts ever again<eos> We could have kept going<eos> We have been in debt too long<eos> We can't possible keep up<eos> Qiao Hua<eos> We are all getting old<eos> I could come with you<eos> Father I don't want to marry<eos> Haven't the debtors already come?<eos> We said we would pay them in two days
Thousands.<eos> Align yourselves with rome!<eos> Pledge your service to the auxiliary And join us in our campaign!<eos> To what end?<eos> Victory.<eos> And how is it to be measured?<eos> The getae have raided our villages in the past.<eos> Raped our women.<eos> Killed our children.<eos> Each time have pushed them back.
What?<eos> Look, our orbit has been refined.<eos> It's going to be four weeks, two days, seven hours before we jump back to FTL.<eos> I'm proposing we take advantage of the wait.<eos> I thought you said we were almost out of shuttle range.<eos> We are, but... We're going to swing back into range once we circle the star and before we jump to FTL.<eos> We send a team down now, and we can pick them back up in a month's time, loaded with supplies.<eos> We time it right on the return, we could take two, maybe three trips.<eos> What about the aliens?<eos> We didn't see them.
But you promise me, at the first sign of trouble, we pull the plug.<eos> - Fine. - Okay.<eos> I'll call him right now.<eos> - Give me a hug.<eos> Good luck.<eos> - Get me Jason Drake on the phone.<eos> - What made Drake choose those species?<eos> - Because they both are amphibious and they have a high immunity to human diseases.<eos> Drake hoped that their DNA could create a vaccine.<eos> A vaccine that would not only make humans immune to biological agents, but would make them stronger and more agile, as well.
Who's that?<eos> Dionis Segui's wife.<eos> Poorthing's not all here.<eos> Look, it's that one!<eos> How do you know it is?<eos> Mr. Madern told me it's the only one with an archangel.<eos> A silver one at that.<eos> My mother has a photo of a boy with that name.<eos> And the flowers are fresh.<eos> Your mother puts them there.
You and your mother think about it.<eos> We've already discussed it.<eos> Come here.<eos> She'll do what you say, whatever's best for you.<eos> We'll sign him up so he won't lose his place and later he'll say yes.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I buried two serins.<eos> - You buried them alive?<eos> - So what?<eos> You kill them too.
Smash.<eos> All right, squeeze in.<eos> You know, you can't do this every morning.<eos> It's way too corny.<eos> Come on. Smile.<eos> It's just till he's 1 8.<eos> -A present.<eos> -Oh, great.<eos> What's that?<eos> You hate brushing your teeth and that brushes them in 30 seconds.
It was for a new drug he developed Which was supposed to eliminate free radicals... creating longevity, And healing incurable diseases.<eos> Kaminsky had a hard time finding volunteers, though.<eos> So, he made a deal with the penal system.<eos> The inmates on death row were offered parole Or a reduced sentence if they volunteered to be the lab rats.<eos> What he didn't tell the inmates was what the drug would actually do.<eos> He gave it to them and they died.<eos> Instantly.<eos> The drug only worked if it had a chemical reaction inside the body first.<eos> Something about the breath exhaled at the moment of death made it work.<eos> He collected them. And the other half of the group, Who were all suffering from terminal illnesses,
Meet me there tomorrow at noon.<eos> They sent some more guys by the house.<eos> Sat there glaring at me while I filled out some paperwork.<eos> You're doing the right thing. Just stay cool, do as they ask, and we'll take care of it.<eos> - Can't you talk to them or...<eos> - It's not gonna do much good at this point.<eos> They may back off for a while, but they'll come right back and do it again to someone else.<eos> An insurance scam is like a network... doctors, lawyers, auto repair places, enforcers.<eos> If you don't want people coming after you, you have to take down the whole thing.<eos> - Pull the weed out by the roots. - We'll get these guys going on a scam... call the cops and get them caught in the act.
That information is confidential.<eos> I can't get that many files that fast without anyone knowing.<eos> I don't want to hurt you, but I need the documents.<eos> You don't want to hurt me?<eos> You are blackmailing me.<eos> You acted like you were my friend and...<eos> What kind of a person...<eos> Listen to me, Tina.<eos> This will go a lot easier for you if you just do what I'm asking.<eos> So they'll find the documents missing, you can say you... you misfiled them, y-you forgot about them...
The window of opportunity arrived.<eos> If you can put down the sword in your hand and leave this path<eos> I am happy to be the last person you kill.<eos> Pack up Bodhi's remains and take them to the Yunhe Temple in Nanjing.<eos> Give them to the monk named Delusion The secret of the remains is...<eos> Doctor, I want a face that will blend in so that I can live in the city and lead a normal life.<eos> Think it through.<eos> After you drink this medicine, you will be a different person.<eos> I don't want to ever see this face again.<eos> First I will take some poisonous insects and place them in your hand.

This is wrong.<eos> It's a fake!<eos> It's fake!<eos> Kill them!<eos> Let's move in!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Who are you?<eos> I've been a Dark Stone assassin for decades.<eos> Now I am old and sick.<eos> If these remains can really restore your health, Why don't I take them for myself?
I hate eunuchs!<eos> I hate the way I talk!<eos> I hate that I can't grow mustache!<eos> I hate...<eos> I've had to hide my kung fu skills.<eos> Once I understand the secret of Bodhi's remains and restore myself, we can retire from this world.<eos> We can live freely.<eos> Just the two of us.<eos> You really think it will grow back?<eos> We've all been fighting over the remains, and when we get them, they turn out to be a big joke.
Just... just take one thing at a time.<eos> We have to deal with what you did.<eos> So write your statement.<eos> I'll check back with you.<eos> Cole.<eos> Hey.<eos> Do you have some time?<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Can it wait?<eos> I need to review these protocols before Arlo distributes them.
That way we can work off our own net without Pillar breathing down our necks.<eos> Got it.<eos> Setting up alternate network now.<eos> We're up.<eos> Okay, I'm restricting access to you and me.<eos> How long will it take you to make the loop?<eos> I can only give you 90 seconds.<eos> Anything more than that, somebody will notice.<eos> Okay, text me when you're set up.<eos> Fredericks, McDermott was injured in the E.M.P. blast, so I need you to collect the night shift time cards and take them to my office.
Farhad, talk to me.<eos> Over here!<eos> Medic!<eos> Come on!<eos> Medic!<eos> That's him, that's Farhad.<eos> Owen, take your team and sweep the area.<eos> Chloe, we've got Farhad, but he's been hit.<eos> I need those files immediately.<eos> I.R.K. intelligence just sent them over.
Make a hole!<eos> Where did Bauer take President Logan?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You must have seen something.<eos> Come on... tell me you saw something.<eos> - Sorry, sir. - Nothing?<eos> No one saw anything.<eos> Eden, they went through an underground service gate.<eos> I need those schematics.<eos> Sending them to you now.
I know this must be hard for you, having to report to me since you've been demoted.<eos> It's okay, Chloe, I deserved it.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> I just want you to know I'm actually glad you didn't get fired or anything and...<eos> Hang in there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Where are we on aerial detection?<eos> I've got drones covering every inch of the waterfront with their radiation detectors cranked up.<eos> If they try to bring the fuel rods into the city by boat, we'll spot them.
I will not!<eos> You will!<eos> Because if you don't, my administration will disclose hard, indisputable evidence that agents inside your intelligence service attempted to detonate a nuclear device on our soil, which will give me all the justification I need to retaliate against the IRK<eos> with the full force of the American military. It will be decades before your country recovers.<eos> But it doesn't need to come to that.<eos> All you have to do is sign the agreement.<eos> Dalia?<eos> First they murder my husband, and now this woman who has lied to me is threatening my country!<eos> I don't see a way out of this, Madam President.<eos> We can tell the world what these Russian bastards did, and how President Taylor protected them.
- They were heading southeast when they left the hotel.<eos> They've got to be near the F train stop by the Williamsburg Bridge.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Cole and I will head down there now.<eos> - We'll bring Tac from here.<eos> - You need me to send a second team?<eos> Yes, and aerial.<eos> Everything you've got.<eos> Have your men ready and assembled right away.<eos> Mr. President, we're going to need you to stall them
- You need me to send a second team?<eos> Yes, and aerial.<eos> Everything you've got.<eos> Have your men ready and assembled right away.<eos> Mr. President, we're going to need you to stall them<eos> - when they call back.<eos> - How?<eos> We'll set up a fake file that you can transmit.<eos> They'll see through that, Mr. Bauer.<eos> Eventually, but right now we just need you to stall them long enough so we can locate your daughter.
Cole, I want you to take the sniper to your north.<eos> - Maintain coverage until we're clear.<eos> - Copy that.<eos> I want both of you to get ready to unload all the weapons from the back, you ready?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Let's go, go, go!<eos> How did they know where to look for us?<eos> They must have followed us from the vault.<eos> Cole, use your infrared!<eos> Call out the snipers as you see them!
As soon as he's done, he's going to execute him.<eos> We're at the staging area; I'll let you know as soon as we're moving in.<eos> - Is this everyone? - Yes, sir.<eos> Okay, Cole, I want you and your team to take down the lookouts;<eos> I want coordinated kill shots and I want you to cover the perimeter as we move in.<eos> Charters, Bank, you're gonna be with me.<eos> We're gonna use audio surveillance to locate the apartment where they're holding President Hassan.<eos> I want all of you to silence your weapons.<eos> The only way this operation works is if we take these terrorists by surprise.<eos> If they get a sense that we're moving in on them, President Hassan is dead.
President Hassan was dead before we even got there.<eos> Then you don't owe me an apology.<eos> I failed you, ma'am.<eos> It was Hassan's choice to surrender himself in order to save American lives.<eos> It was out of your hands.<eos> Don't put this responsibility on yourself.<eos> Madam President, you need to keep this peace agreement alive.<eos> There can't be any agreement when the IRK is without a leader, Jack.<eos> The hardliners there will take advantage of the vacuum and-and reverse all the progress we made with Hassan.<eos> I'm gonna have to address the delegates in a few minutes and announce the dissolution of the peace summit, and, and formally release them.
If they collapse around me, Then I will be unable to help her from beneath the rubble.<eos> I will not die until she is safe.<eos> Well, prove it so.<eos> Fight as one with crixus, to best theokoles.<eos> Or we are all fucked.<eos> Yes.<eos> Barca has returned, bearing gifts.<eos> Remove him to the barracks.<eos> Two slaves, broken by your hand, Made attempt on my life.<eos> Who purchased them?
I am not among them.<eos> You tell us the shadow wounds both When he is pressed and when he is given ground.<eos> How will he to be defeated?<eos> By accomplishing both at once.<eos> Press... And defend.<eos> Distract... And strike.<eos> Fight as one.<eos> Or die as two.<eos> Now, show me the way to honor.<eos> The games tomorrow, and yet he presses them.
Oh, oh!<eos> It's okay.<eos> Oopsie. Is he home?<eos> What is it, what is it?<eos> I got it.<eos> I got it. What?<eos> Why does your dad have condoms in his desk drawer?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was looking for scissors the other day.<eos> And I found them.
A man who tells stories for a living but doesn't know when to stop.<eos> Some men use escorts because they don't have time for a relationship, or they want something special, something their wives or girlfriends can't offer them.<eos> And some men, like Duncan, use prostitutes because they can.<eos> Because it's easier, a simple exchange, without truth or consequence.<eos> And for Duncan, a man so fundamentally dishonest, he doesn't even know when he is lying, it's the closest to a real relationship he will ever get. '<eos> Come on, Gloria and her husband are taking us out for breakfast.<eos> Belle, make him stop calling me that!<eos> I have no control over Ben, never have, never will.<eos> In my job, secrets are unavoidable.<eos> It's who you tell them to that really counts and from now on I keep my secrets with those I love best.
That's the only way we're ever getting off this godforsaken rock.<eos> - Well, I don't see that happening.<eos> - Well, let's just hope you're wrong.<eos> Where you been?<eos> Can I speak to you in private?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - Everything go all right?<eos> Did Widmore see you?<eos> - No, but his people did.<eos> - And you let them live?
Locke saved you.<eos> What about the rest of your group?<eos> What happened to them?<eos> The ones who weren't killed scattered into the jungle.<eos> It's just the three of us now.<eos> Why did he bring me here?<eos> Because your friends got themselves captured.<eos> And now... we're gonna have to rescue them.<eos> Rescue them from what?<eos> Widmore has them in a cage - about a half a mile inland.
Any idea how that thing works?<eos> Can we turn it off?<eos> This watch is jury-rigged to the battery.<eos> - The battery detonates the explosives.<eos> - How much time till we're up, Frank?<eos> At least five minutes.<eos> We ain't got five minutes.<eos> What's it gonna be, Sayid?<eos> These wires, leads from the watch.<eos> If we disconnect them from the battery, - technically, the bomb should be inert.
Candidates?<eos> Candidates for what?<eos> To replace Jacob.<eos> She said I was one of them.<eos> And so are you, and so is Hurley.<eos> Well, that's great.<eos> So, what do we do now?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Then who does?<eos> After I've brought them to the Temple what do I do?
Mac.<eos> It's not that easy.<eos> Sure, to us, he's a black market arms dealer.<eos> But to everyone else... he's become a respected businessman... and a major political donor.<eos> He's untouchable.<eos> Oh, I'll touch him, rookie.<eos> I'll touch him wherever I want.<eos> Now, Mac, one thing we have working in our favor... is that Cunth needs passcodes to make the X-5 operational.<eos> It is imperative that Cunth does not get those codes.<eos> Oh, thanks. Because before you said something... I thought it'd be fine if he got them.
Numerius insisted upon him, yet with his wounds barely sealed...<eos> He believes himself ready.<eos> To a fault.<eos> The ego bruises deeper than the flesh.<eos> He brought this house great honor, not long ago.<eos> Do not overly embarrass the man.<eos> I will give Numerius a show.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> When I put on the toga virilis, it was in this very room, surrounded by my father's champions.<eos> Even then I knew that one day my own titans would eclipse them all. None more so than Spartacus, the bringer of rain.
And the promise of vengeance from the afterlife if you betray it.<eos> The deal is struck.<eos> Make it appear a sincere fight.<eos> Finish preparing him.<eos> Behold...<eos> Spartacus!<eos> Behold, Ixion!<eos> The wager is placed?<eos> The sum has been spread among the brokers to ease suspicion.<eos> What weapons shall the gods bless them with?
Did you see the tears of gratitude in his eyes?<eos> Gratitude falls short of loyalty.<eos> He's not the man crixus is.<eos> And crixus is not the man he was, And may never be again.<eos> Spartacus will be reunited with his wife.<eos> And in the act... I will bind him to us and this ludus...<eos> Until god comes to claim us all... how will you save us?<eos> From the rain.<eos> Your victory splits the skies.<eos> How will you close them before we all drown?
Enough even to erase questions Of how a blade belonging to the magistrate's son Came to your possession.<eos> Let us put the past truly behind us.<eos> Come the games await you.<eos> I have but one condition.<eos> Condition?<eos> You kiss my cheek only to finger my ass? !<eos> Uh!<eos> Speak! Before I carve out your fucking tongue.<eos> I will take to the sands Against the spectre of my countrymen.<eos> But I will face them alone.
Don't worry, I won't ride fast.<eos> Roll like a retiree!<eos> And don't use up all the credit on my phone!<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Watch out, man.<eos> 40% of retirees don't reach 65.<eos> And you want your affidavit?<eos> Either that or I have to buy back trimesters.<eos> Buy back?<eos> Yeah, see, if I buy trimesters, if I buy them back, I can add them to time already worked...
You had isabella's books.<eos> She knew you were stealing.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Guys, listen to me, please.<eos> All right, damon was the one who was stealing, all right?<eos> I was trying to convince isabella, but he had her fooled.<eos> I - I needed to find proof.<eos> However the hell damon did it, There's no evidence in those books.<eos> Every large money transfer Was authorized by isabella, all right?<eos> She signed them herself.
We're here to work.<eos> You think it's really fun to watch filming?<eos> Today will be awesome.<eos> Uncle Wah and Yu So-chow are filming a wuxia film.<eos> Keep watching and be quiet.<eos> Action.<eos> Now that you have completed your training, you may seek revenge.<eos> But remember... you must always help the needy.<eos> Master, thanks for rescuing me 18 years ago.<eos> I'll find my parents' killer and avenge them.
I ran for seventh grade class president. I got three votes.<eos> And one of them didn't count because you're not allowed to vote for seventh graders.<eos> Santa Claus goes to our school?<eos> No he doesn't.<eos> He lives in the North Pole.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> I mean, it gets a little annoying after a while.<eos> Plus it eats up our minutes.<eos> But you've got friends.<eos> I've seen them, I've talked to them.
Telford, you connected with him.<eos> Was it a residual memory of his that somehow transferred to my subconscious?<eos> I would think you'd be doing everything possible to get these people home, to get yourself home, back to your wife.<eos> And I know you're still sleeping with her. Everett!<eos> You're up late. Yeah.<eos> I just had a very interesting dream.<eos> Everyone thinks their dreams are interesting.<eos> Nobody else cares.<eos> Yeah, well, you're going to care about this one.<eos> I'm outside a warehouse, on Earth, and there's birds... at least I can hear them.
Not that far out into the unknown universe.<eos> Well, it's a rust bucket, what can I tell you?<eos> I can't wait to see it for myself.<eos> What if I can't do it?<eos> What if we just fail to make a connection?<eos> Kiva promised she wouldn't kill you. Her word is good.<eos> I'll have to kill you myself.<eos> You think I was brainwashed?<eos> I came to my senses.<eos> We freed billions of people from thousands of years of slavery all over our galaxy, and then we patted ourselves on the back and left them with little or no means for survival.
As Director of Public Prosecutions, I'm telling.<eos> You try that girl for murder... and you make sure she's convicted.<eos> That woman was put on this earth just to irritate my duodenum.<eos> Whatever it takes, you guarantee that that jury find on manslaughter, diminished responsibility, and not murder.<eos> I want that girl in a hospital, not a prison.<eos> What about the DPP?<eos> Screw the DPP?<eos> I answer to Conor's mother on this one.<eos> Dr Guinott talks about kids being like white cement.<eos> Whatever falls on them makes an impression.
OK, Matt. One sec. Listen, do us a favour, Teddy, get hold of his gloves and forensicate them.<eos> OK.<eos> PS Garvey wasn't wearing gloves.<eos> I remember putting that in my report.<eos> You said this was an informal chat.<eos> Your report says that the gloves were found in his pockets.<eos> Now, our forensic report says that there was gunshot residue on them.<eos> Now, our forensic report says that there was gunshot residue on them. So, you can see why we're confused, can't you, Omar?<eos> I mean, maths has never been my strong point but this really doesn't add up, don't you think?<eos> So, how did the gun residue get onto PS Garvey's gloves if he wasn't wearing them?
Did she talk to him like she talks to you?<eos> I think she's allowed to be a bit ratty under the circumstances.<eos> Did he mind that she was a workaholic?<eos> Was? She intends to sue the hospital for causing renal failure.<eos> You've got it wrong.<eos> Dad adores her.<eos> Why would he do this to her?<eos> To get access to her money.<eos> Her insurance and her estate goes to my kids.<eos> Now I have to tell them that their gran doesn't want to see them.
And did anybody see my husband on the phone?<eos> No witnesses as yet.<eos> So it's obvious what happened, isn't it?<eos> Someone was following us and they saw us loading up the car, and they made the call.<eos> You said you were listening to the radio at the time.<eos> We'd had an argument, and Dan went outside to cool off.<eos> So he did leave your side?<eos> But I could see him all the time through the window.<eos> Why was he in his running shorts?<eos> Well, because we wears them around the house.
I could find out where their base is.<eos> My father's known for years.<eos> You wanna give us a hand here?<eos> Final calculations. Very delicate.<eos> FLASH: Are we there yet?<eos> That wasn't funny the first 15 times you said it, either.<eos> Enjoy yourselves while you can.<eos> - My friends are going to tear you apart.<eos> - Told you we should have Left her.<eos> We couldn't take the chance she'd escape and warn them we're coming.
Stand by your phone.<eos> I'm going to have to clean this mess up.<eos> Lie still or you'll open the wound.<eos> - What time is it?<eos> - Around noon.<eos> Kids are packed, ready to go.<eos> We need to get moving.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Get down.<eos> - Go to the children, keep them quiet.

She just killed Rivers.<eos> Understood.<eos> Hey, don't fall asleep.<eos> It's dangerous.<eos> That's a concussion.<eos> Okay, then... It's boring.<eos> So, what do you think they'll do with them?<eos> Who?<eos> The prisoners.<eos> Probably drop them off on some planet.
We'll get it done, sir.<eos> I know you will.<eos> Gear up.<eos> They have only the time between the gamma ray bursts to complete their work.<eos> The next one is less than 20 minutes from now, so obviously time is an issue.<eos> So what do you need from us?<eos> There's a hull breach in the access corridor that's under your control.<eos> It's the exit point closest to the array.<eos> We need you to let us in.<eos> Transfer control of all the ship systems to us, and we will let them in.
Oh, my god.<eos> The, uh, elevator stopped.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Go.<eos> It's okay.<eos> First bomb's always the hardest.<eos> You know, it's not that embarrassing.<eos> I do not want to talk about it.<eos> How did you get the elevators to stop without the numbers stopping?<eos> I sped them up 1.5 seconds per floor for the first 10 floors...

I'm suffering from a headache and the universe.<eos> What I feel like doing is dying, at least temporarily, but this, as I've indicated, is only because my head aches.<eos> Covering my eyes won't blind me, but it will keep me from seeing...<eos> My head aches because my head aches.<eos> The universe hurts me because my head hurts.<eos> But the universe that actually hurts me is not the true one, which exists only to me and which, should I pass my hands through my hair, makes me feel that each strand suffers for no other reason than to make me suffer.<eos> God is good but the devil isn't so bad.<eos> It's as if my life amounted to being trashed by it.<eos> What do I have to do with life?<eos> The most contemptible thing about dreams is that everyone has them.
Stay there.<eos> Here you are, you'll be fine here.<eos> Everything is easy here.<eos> Pretty weird, right?<eos> But really great!<eos> This is the land of plenty.<eos> Everything is possible here.<eos> Organised crime, terrorism...<eos> We have illegal aliens delivered to our door.<eos> And we put them in the coop, upstairs.
Happy trails.<eos> Well, that's it.<eos> They're gone.<eos> It's a big room, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, it's big.<eos> So quiet.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means, "Men are all around me, love me, like flies around the light."<eos> "But if they..."<eos> - How do you say "the fire takes them?"
"Charity degrades those who receive it and hardens those who dispense it."<eos> That's French or something, isn't it?<eos> - George Sand.<eos> - He was a poet.<eos> He was a she, actually.<eos> Baroness Amandine Lucile Dupin.<eos> Sand was her pen-name.<eos> My employer was a barrister.<eos> The house was filled with books.<eos> - And I'll bet you read them all.
I brought them to protect me!<eos> Boy.<eos> We are going to be civilized.<eos> And gonna go get some ice-cream cones reacquaint ourselves with each other and see if, over time there might still be something meaningful in our marriage. I would hope for nothing more than that.<eos> And then you're gonna bring me right back here and let me out.<eos> Do we understand each other?<eos> Always.<eos> Then drive.<eos> The mums have been delivered to the warehouse. Grower's renting me his van.<eos> I'm picking them up at 4 a.m. When I get to the casino, I'll have plenty of time to cut them.
Oh, my back!<eos> Oh, my hip is out.<eos> What the fuck is with all these birds, Lois?<eos> Frank, you know I don't like that language.<eos> When will you let me live--?<eos> Frank.<eos> Frank, will you let me live in peace for a percentage of a neat little business I've got going?<eos> What kind of little business?<eos> Selling birds to pet shops.<eos> I buy them for $30 and I sell them for 700.

First one done!<eos> Once upon a time, some weak, pathetic pussy coined the phrase "winning isn't everything."<eos> Well, for most people in most situations he was right, but I'm not one of those people.<eos> And this is not one of those situations.<eos> Blue Mountain State has won 17 national championships right on this field...<eos> Six on my watch alone.<eos> Because we don't just beat our opponents, gentlemen.<eos> We crush their will to live.<eos> We suck the milk out of their mothers' tits. And use it as mouthwash.<eos> We rip off their dicks and invite them to an orgy.
- Where are you?<eos> - I'm busy.<eos> Great.<eos> We don't have a new symptom.<eos> We should stick him back on his blood thinners, and he can leave in a couple weeks.<eos> Actually, we do have a new symptom.<eos> Any of you take a look at his readmittance chart?<eos> Between the time he checked in and the time he rechecked in, our patient lost a single pound.<eos> Patient like that would usually shed over ten pounds.<eos> The obvious answer would be steroids, but since we've already ruled them out...
You based all that on the fact that she didn't want to lie down?<eos> That, and the cardiac echo I performed after she didn't want to lie down.<eos> Her mitral valve is nearly gone. Which means she's nearly gone.<eos> God, you're pretty.<eos> We can replace the mitral valve with a pig valve or with a plastic one.<eos> From an actual pig?<eos> It's the better choice if you want to have children someday.<eos> A plastic valve requires you to be on anticoagulants, which cause birth defects.<eos> On the other hand, the pig valve wears out quickly, so you'd need another heart surgery in ten years.<eos> I know you're on the fence about having kids, but Taylor really wants them.
Could you just get me down?<eos> You know, I can't figure you guys out.<eos> You plan a burglary, I mean, you must have had drivers waiting to come in the front do, right?<eos> You go through all that trouble, and you can't bring a rope that's long enough.<eos> You know how many of these dumbasses I've had to cut down?<eos> Look, man, my shoulders are killing me.<eos> Can you just hurry it up?<eos> Where are the other guys?<eos> Read me my rights and get me the down!<eos> Actually, I don't have to read them.
Every time I see your shoe collection, - I'm more impressed.<eos> - So you're in the closet.<eos> I think it's towards the bottom.<eos> Okay, Louboutins, Chloe?<eos> Wow. It's like an archeological dig in here.<eos> I think it's behind the Manolos.<eos> Ooh. This looks interesting.<eos> You have it?<eos> No, no, but these Jimmy Choo slingbacks... They're adorable.<eos> Tell me you didn't get them on sale.
Better yet, leave it on the table and then back away.<eos> Hey, teach.<eos> Hi!<eos> I just dropped off Juanita for her first day.<eos> She's a little nervous.<eos> Aw, she's gonna love it here.<eos> The teachers are great.<eos> - So what animal is she?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Oh, they test the kids and they place them in groups according to their level.
I got carried away.<eos> Me, too.<eos> It was just so important to me that Juanita was doing well.<eos> I know.<eos> No, I don't think you do.<eos> My kids are my calling card.<eos> They're what I have to show for myself.<eos> I don't have a career, Susan.<eos> My kids are my job.<eos> And whatever happens... if they succeed or they don't succeed... it's because of how I raise them.
Days later, blankets laid out as a cross in the snow signaled the devastating news.<eos> Mallory and Irvine were lost, presumed dead.<eos> Mrs Mallory, Herschel House, Cambridge...<eos> Committee deeply regret receive bad news.<eos> Everest expedition today...<eos> Your husband killed... Last climb.<eos> Committee offer you and family heartfelt sympathy.<eos> Ruth received the news one evening.<eos> She decided not to tell her children that night because they'd already gone to bed.<eos> She actually went to bed herself and slept with that terrible knowledge, then in morning woke them up and took them into her bed, and told them this terrible news.
One... here it is...<eos> Here it is...<eos> Come on!<eos> Three.<eos> - I'm too good at these games.<eos> Why don't you let the kids win sometimes?<eos> - Why should I let them win?<eos> - We never win.<eos> It would send the wrong message.<eos> I'd always let them win.
{\pos(192,275)}{\$But somehow, he's making sense.}<eos> {\pos(240,190)}{\$We must prepare for our quest in the danger room.}<eos> {\$Danger room?<eos> {\$That's where the X-Men train.<eos> Part of X-Mansion.}<eos> {\$I can't believe I know that.}<eos> {\$<eos> - That's it! - Were are you going?<eos> {\$The Danger Room... is also where Hiro...} {\$keeps his comic books.}<eos> {\$I think he wants us to use them to figure this out.}
If they're wrapped around his finger, He's gonna use them to protect himself.<eos> They're lambs.<eos> They know no better.<eos> He's brainwashed them, edgar. Look what he did to you.<eos> He turned you from a juggler into an assassin.<eos> Even if we stopped samuel, Can you promise me that somebody else Won't just take his place?<eos> I know that you think of this as a family, But it has a lot more in common with a cult.<eos> Your friends need help.<eos> They need to be left alone.<eos> Left alone out in the open makes them targets.
Look, I'm not afraid of you, okay?<eos> So if this is about revenge...<eos> Well, after what you did to me, I was tempted.<eos> But I don't want to be that person anymore.<eos> I need you to go inside my head again.<eos> You're serious?<eos> Wow' You are insane.<eos> If I am, it's because that's what my powers have made me.<eos> I can't live with them anymore, Parkman.<eos> So you need to take them away.
Come on, let her go.<eos> Let her go.<eos> I'll try again. Come on.<eos> It's not good enough.<eos> - You see what you made me do?<eos> - Hey!<eos> I don't even know if I can do this for you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Maybe you need a little more motivation.<eos> You will purge me of these powers, Parkman. Or I will use them. I will use them all.
And now you want us to arrest him.<eos> Yes.<eos> We can't do that, Mr. Darbo.<eos> Listen, pal, sometimes it's better just to accept these things.<eos> Sometimes the best way to forget about someone you care about is to, fill the void with someone you don't quite so much.<eos> Yeah, all kinds of rabbits.<eos> Angora, lop-eared... One missing a leg. That one's free.<eos> 'Cause I heard that they make good... companion animals.<eos> Absolutely, they do.<eos> I mean, not a lot of people know this, but you can train a rabbit to use a little litter box, which makes them better than cats.
- I said don't come close.<eos> Listen, my father has nothing to do with all this.<eos> - Your father lied to me.<eos> - My father is lonely, and you're hot.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I was the one who took the key and have been spying on you.<eos> - You?<eos> - Do you have nightmares?<eos> - What?<eos> - Sara also had them.
Kurt, hey!<eos> What-What the hell's going on with our parents?<eos> How did this happen?<eos> When did they even meet each other?<eos> Parent-Teacher conference night, about a month ago.<eos> I always accompany my father to those conferences, to act as translator.<eos> How do you know this is not organic?<eos> Because you can see the logo.<eos> It's encrusted in the cookie.<eos> Fate brought them together.
No offense.<eos> None taken.<eos> So we put an end to them.<eos> Agreed?<eos> Agreed.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm going to flush Dad's ashes down the toilet.<eos> Have you lost your mind? ! What?<eos> I'm just doing the same thing you're doing to him.<eos> What's the point of keeping his remains around if you're just gonna dump them out like an old ashtray?
- If she can straighten herself out, I certainly can.<eos> But how?<eos> I'm not becoming a Cheerio.<eos> Wait.<eos> I don't need to be a cheerleader. - I just need to date one. - #Yeah, yeah #<eos> Get ready, black girl from Glee Club... whose name I can't remember right now. The Puckster is about to make you his.<eos> - Um-Wait.<eos> What are these?<eos> - My vitamin supplements.<eos> I'm taking them three times a day.
- Can we talk about this?<eos> - There's nothing to talk about.<eos> I'm cutting the program.<eos> Hooray!<eos> Hooray.<eos> - Hey, Bryan, can I talk to you for a second? - Make it quick.<eos> I'm rehearsing. You know, reviewing my single line.<eos> I want to take one last shot at convincing you not to cut the program.<eos> Give it a rest, Will.<eos> You think you're helping these kids... when all you're doing is setting them up to be jaded and bitter.
So here's what happened last week.<eos> Will's old rival tried to cancel the club. - You're done here.<eos> - Then he was really into it.<eos> I got custom-made jean jackets.<eos> Then he tried to cancel it again.<eos> You think you're helping these kids... when all you're doing is setting them up to be jaded and bitter.
Isn't anyone around?<eos> Dad's outside, he'll be right in.<eos> Rosario's your father?<eos> What's he doing?<eos> He's killing the trees.<eos> Hi.<eos> Nobody around?<eos> I wanted an outside terrace with tables and chairs for summer, a sort of biergarten.<eos> But they won't let me cut down the trees.<eos> They'll only give authorization if they're dead, so I kill them with copper nails.
A way shall present itself.<eos> Answer!<eos> It best "present" fucking soon.<eos> Did I tell you to stand?<eos> Glaber falls to patronage, and the men of influence greet me as a fucking brother!<eos> A day of shining glory.<eos> Marred by darkening cloud.<eos> I beg a word, Dominus.<eos> In private.<eos> Doctore, well spill sour thoughts, and hear them sweetened.
I loved my brother.<eos> But you knew Bowman.<eos> You knew how he could get.<eos> And that woman, she showed some spunk... You think about it... Doing what she did.<eos> And then there's the Bible.<eos> In the Bible, it says that a man should see to the needs of his brother's widow, and intend to do that.<eos> Well, they sure are taking their sweet time.<eos> Hey, let me ask you something.<eos> Shouldn't we have our money from your boys in Lexington by now?<eos> I'll give them a call.
Nea... little girl that Nature gave me, you are in my body.<eos> You gave Oa back to me. For you, I want to go back to my birth place to find my lost brother, my other half.<eos> Hooked beak, you're still here.<eos> I came through here on the long walk.<eos> Northern Europe<eos> Big horned animals...<eos> We'd follow you for a long time on hunts.<eos> Your meat gives our minds your bodies' strength.<eos> The men with painted faces are scared of me.<eos> I don't know them.
What's the snag?<eos> I can only give you 2 pence for 4.<eos> That's not worth it.<eos> 3 pence then.<eos> I'd lose a penny.<eos> - And save a two-day journey.<eos> I never heard of nothing like this before.<eos> Is an extra two days worth a penny to you or not?<eos> What are we to do with 4 fleeces?<eos> Take them to Winchester and sell them.
Tell Nam No Han to take out the eyeballs of the girl called Somee.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> When kids are dead, you took their organs out.<eos> Liver sent to the west coast, eyes to the east coast heart to Seoul<eos> Right?<eos> I didn't do that<eos> Those poor little ones.........couldn't even close their eyes with such cruel deaths....<eos> Did it ever occur to you, even just for once?<eos> Than, on the other hand, have you ever thought about what will be their bodies worth?<eos> You know even their own parents have abandoned them after all.
Have a safe journey.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye, Christopher.<eos> - See you. Thank you for everything.<eos> Keep the good work up.<eos> Certainly will.<eos> I'll call you in a couple of weeks. Right.<eos> Bye.<eos> As I can't communicate with you much, I'm going to write little notes and put them in a little book.
NORWEGIAN NINJA The True Story<eos> HM NINJA FORCE ORIENTATION VIDEO<eos> The Ninja Force is based on Grassy Island in the Oslo Fjord.<eos> Free of cars, rich in wildlife, comfortably distanced from the mute resignation and hysterical overcompensation of the city.<eos> We grow and hunt our own food.<eos> We have our own vehicle depot, barbecue beach, freestyle firing range, RR tent and dojo.<eos> Many think the Ninja were assassins.<eos> Not true!<eos> They were farmers like us.<eos> These brave Japanese peasants rose against the Samurai empire who tried to force them into war, and they beat the shit out of them.
Spirit.<eos> The first Gay Pride flag was made by a man named Gilbert Baker in 1978.<eos> He gave a meaning to each color.<eos> This man was President.<eos> This was invented.<eos> This is what movies looked like.<eos> Pets.<eos> On November 27th, 1978, Harvey Milk was shot and killed.<eos> One week after, my father opened his annual museum Christmas exhibit.<eos> He collected stuffed animals from people in the community and he put them on display.
While flowers can blossom again, time lost will never return.<eos> This girl is as delicate as jade.<eos> Please don't be mad at her.<eos> Master Huang, easy easy...<eos> Shame we didn't meet until now!<eos> Diamonds, the girl - they're all yours.<eos> I've brought my wife with me.<eos> So I can't take her home.<eos> Then take the diamonds for your wife.<eos> I accept them on her behalf.
You're my saviour.<eos> Not him.<eos> Did you think I was lying dead back there?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Sure?<eos> Never crossed my mind.<eos> I've to hand this to you.<eos> Abracadabra, and Hu Wan magically appeared!<eos> But I really didn't get it.<eos> Those six bodies, such a distance, so little time, how did you move them so quickly?
It's been nine days since my last drink.<eos> And boy, don't I know it.<eos> But I'm just hoping that with the support of this new group, I'll be able to make it ten days. Then 11, and keep going.<eos> Stay on the straight and narrow.<eos> Stay dry.<eos> Well done, well done.<eos> Please don't say you got that idea from me.<eos> You should be pleased!<eos> Pleased? ! Don't be fucking ridiculous!<eos> It's like when they dress up those bears and make them dance for the tourists in Istanbul.
Thank you.<eos> There's no milk.<eos> Oh, er, we ran out.<eos> Sorry, brother.<eos> Look, listen.<eos> I'm not your brother, all right?<eos> I'm a scientist.<eos> What are these?<eos> Er, body bags for the Type Threes.<eos> But we're curing them.
And where then?<eos> No answer.<eos> Fucking hell.<eos> Here.<eos> Where?<eos> NO, HERE.<eos> Look, he took the body bags.<eos> He was in this room.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I - Is he looking for them?
Thanks.<eos> What's the box for?<eos> Well, I thought I'd start getting over it by cleaning out Wade's room.<eos> I don't think you'll need the box.<eos> Wow!<eos> When did you guys do all this?<eos> We've been working on it all night.<eos> It's been a real bonding experience for the pledge class.<eos> How'd you get them to do it?<eos> I think seeing me yell at you really made an impression on them.
Anesthesia?<eos> That's for before operations, right?<eos> I want to be a doctor.<eos> I'm just a nurse.<eos> It beats being killed in one of Zebra City's hospitals.<eos> Luckily, you're safe here, and among friends.<eos> Huh? "Friends"?<eos> These guys are?<eos> Like you, they're victims of Zebra Time.<eos> I brought them here.
This is Racquel!<eos> Hi. Hi.<eos> Racquel is co-chairing the fundraiser with me.<eos> Mmm-hmm. We're wrapping and we're baking.<eos> Yeah, well, the school needs money.<eos> And you know what gets hit first. It's the arts.<eos> I mean, you know that the fourth and fifth grade orchestra program is just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> Wow. Oh, the preservatives in those things are terrible.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> No, normally I bake them from scratch.
Come to gawp?<eos> - I beg your pardon?<eos> - You have some manners, at least.<eos> They didn't send you, then? Who?<eos> - Those dreadful children... from before.<eos> They said they wanted to see my kinematograph films.<eos> But then they only laughed at me.<eos> What are your films?<eos> You said you had some films. Are they cartoons?<eos> Can I see them?
Go home. No.<eos> I am staying here in your face and telling you to get over it.<eos> For our marriage and for your son, I'm not leaving until you forgive me.<eos> Aren't these bracelets lively?<eos> Bill, something's going on.<eos> You have to come out here.<eos> As far as calling them Lost Boys, I don't even like the term.<eos> It's meant to elicit sympathy, to tug at the heartstrings.<eos> We shouldn't call them Lost Boys. They're common criminals.<eos> We turn away from them because they're connected to a polygamist past that shames us.
I used baseball bats to break into stores for Fritos and doughnuts just to stave off my hunger.<eos> I did things for cash that haunt me to this day.<eos> I was arrested for assaulting a clerk and stealing eight Walkmen to cover my share of rent for the bedroom I shared with four others.<eos> It shames me to say that in front of my children that I was a common criminal much like that boy who some say got what he deserved the other night.<eos> But I found love and support of others to help me reclaim the dignity that I had bartered away for my survival.<eos> My opponent's right. These boys aren't lost. They're thrown away like trash.<eos> There are crimes associated with them and by mothers who stand by silently, unable to speak out of fear.<eos> But the greatest crime is committed by a society that says: "They're not us.<eos> We're not responsible."<eos> Until we embrace them our shadow, our stain we will never be free of our history.
Everything is going to be fine.<eos> Your sister is going to be fine.<eos> When do you leave?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> It's really cool that you understand why I'm going...<eos> If anyone understands doing whatever it takes for your dream, it's me.<eos> Yeah, some girls, you know, wouldn't be cool with somebody that they're getting close to just taking off.<eos> Well, that's not me.<eos> You have to follow your dream.<eos> But I guess some guys, you know maybe would wonder if a girl would wait for them.
Please.<eos> I will do anything that you need, including nothing, if that's what you want.<eos> What I want is to find my mother's killer.<eos> Well, then we need to break Johnny Vong.<eos> So let's break him.<eos> I owe you an apology, Mr. Vong.<eos> Apparently in my haste, I forgot to read you your Miranda rights.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> No! I remember distinctly.<eos> You read them to me.
Yes, Dale, I've heard the good word.<eos> Uh, not my question, but glad to hear it.<eos> I thought it'd be nice to spruce up dinner tonight, and since I did take a napkin folding class at Christian manners camp, I was wondering, would you prefer the bird of paradise or the goblet fan fold?<eos> Good one.<eos> Um... the bird?<eos> Excellent choice.<eos> Billy Graham Cracker has got to go.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The house is already cleaner, the pantry is stocked for the first time in weeks and, look, he made a little bird.<eos> He put psalms in the cereal boxes, and instead of pouring the pretzels into bowls he lays them out in little crosses.
So it seems there's more to warfarin than just rat poison.<eos> It's also a pesticide and a heart medicine.<eos> Prevents the blood from clotting. Mm.<eos> Wikipedia?<eos> Horsemama.<eos> Equally reliable. Mm.<eos> Well, I don't care how strange she is. She knows her stuff.<eos> After she gave me the info, I sent a query about warfarin-related cases to our medical claims division.<eos> You used the company? Awesome.<eos> I had them pull together a list of cases where warfarin was featured and wrote them down by occupation and area.
The tickets, the code, going after the jackpot...<eos> The facts are lining up like lottery balls in a drawing machine.<eos> Mmm, I love the smell of probabilities in the morning.<eos> Well, we... we still don't know how the robbers plan on locating the jackpot ticket once they'd exposed its serial number.<eos> I mean, they'd need to know where each ticket was being distributed, right?<eos> Right, and looking at a ticket individually, there's no way to do that...<eos> unless...<eos> - "Unless" what?<eos> - Well, we've been analyzing these tickets individually.<eos> Looking at them like points on a graph.
One time, he was gone for two weeks. Two weeks?<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> Oh, he always came limping back.<eos> He loved you boys.<eos> Do you know what he did all that time?<eos> Little Sammy kept trying to tell me.<eos> Of course I didn't believe him.<eos> Not at first, anyway.<eos> Katie, our dad, uh, happened to be an expert at getting rid of ghosts and now so are we.<eos> That's why I called them, sweetie.
Bye.<eos> We'll put the platform out front, framed by the entry arch.<eos> The cabin, center onstage so we can enter through it.<eos> - Can you do it by Saturday?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> But I'll need 1-by-3s if I'm gonna frame it right. And quarter-inch plywood, precut.<eos> Cordon off the area in front for maybe 100. We'll need another 100 to create a spillover effect.<eos> I can get the crowd.<eos> The lists are good. I've drafted Sarah to help.<eos> If you pick up the flyers, we can get them all out.
So I got dressed and came across.<eos> And you heard nothing else?<eos> Just the horse.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Did they have children?<eos> There's a daughter, Hanna.<eos> She lives in the town.<eos> I'd kill them!
Booth, this is Dan's equipment bag.<eos> I found his protective headgear inside.<eos> There's blood on the inside of the lip.<eos> It approximates the location of the fracture on Dan's forehead.<eos> The force could have cracked his skull and killed him.<eos> Are you sure nothing happened here? One of your guys, they probably could have hit Dan. You know, practice a little too hard, try to cover it up.<eos> - I mean, you lose your insurance, you're kicked out of the league.<eos> But, hey, it was just an accident, right?<eos> All right, I'll tell you what.<eos> Anybody who's got plans for this weekend, just cancel them.
I paid $2,000, add in the cost of shipping them over, why would I want to take a loss?<eos> The guns are junk, Moses.<eos> What do you expect me to do?<eos> I didn't expect you'd try to screw me.<eos> Maybe I should've.<eos> It's $7.5 million.<eos> Make up the difference on your next deal.<eos> Not interested.<eos> The FBI is all over these guns, Moses.<eos> It's just a matter of days before they trace them to you.
Perez is a legitimate suspect.<eos> And if you still want us to support his appeal, he needs to tell us everything he knows.<eos> Oh, he told me he'd talk to you anytime.<eos> So long as it's face-to-face.<eos> And they say chivalry is dead.<eos> Just run it through my office first, okay?<eos> Of course.<eos> Thank you for the flowers.<eos> You said you didn't like flowers.<eos> I kind of like that you sent them.
And, most importantly, the truck was part of a detachment, ...a division under military authority.<eos> It's up to the military to provide this information so that our friends from Calama can give their dead the burial they deserve.<eos> Will you carry on searching?<eos> For as long as I can, ...if we must carry on searching,<eos> ...I will do so.<eos> Even if I have many doubts and I ask myself questions which I can't answer.<eos> They say they unearthed them, put them in bags and threw them into the sea.<eos> Did they really throw them into the sea?<eos> I can't find the answer to this question.<eos> What if they threw them out nearby, somewhere in the mountains?
That's what I think.<eos> IT WAS NOT A WAR IT WAS A MASSACRE<eos> There were many groups of women searching:<eos> ...in Arica, Iquique, ...Pisagua, La Serena, ...Colina, Paine, Lonquén,<eos> Concepción, Temuco, Punta Arenas...<eos> These women's search never crossed paths with that of the astronomers who were tracking another kind of body: celestial bodies.<eos> Whilst these women handled the desert matter the astronomers discovered that the earth's matter was the same throughout the cosmos.<eos> 10,000 years ago, the first inhabitants of Atacama gathered the pebbles washed up by the sea.<eos> They also knew something of the stars and they buried their dead at night.<eos> Scientists collected the remains of these men of antiquity and classified them meticulously.

Will they be given a burial one day?<eos> Valentina works for the leading astronomy organisation in Chile.<eos> Her grandfather taught her to observe the sky when she was a child.<eos> She is married with two children.<eos> In 1975, when she was one year old, ...she was detained with her grandparents by Pinochet's police.<eos> I am the daughter of detained and disappeared parents.<eos> First they detained my grandparents.<eos> They were held for several hours.<eos> They threatened them relentlessly to make them reveal where my parents were, ...or else I, too, would disappear.<eos> With this threat, ...my grandparents took them to where we lived.
They passed on my parents' values and their strength.<eos> What is more, my grandparents were able to overcome their pain so that I could have a happy and healthy childhood.<eos> Sometimes I feel like I'm a product with a manufacturing defect which is invisible.<eos> I find it funny when people tell me that it doesn't show that I'm the daughter of disappeared prisoners.<eos> I realise that my children don't have this defect.<eos> Nor does my husband and that makes me happy.<eos> I am surrounded by people who have no manufacturing defect.<eos> I am happy that my son is growing up like this.<eos> Compared to the immensity of the cosmos, ...the problems of the Chilean people might seem insignificant.<eos> But if we laid them out on a table, ...they would be as vast as a galaxy.
We used to talk about books.<eos> You are too thin.<eos> When do you last bathe?<eos> Beg your pardon?<eos> Do you bathe?<eos> When? Yes.<eos> Uh, yesterday.<eos> Good. You must bathe once a week at a minimum...<eos> Your hair as well, and fingernails each day.<eos> You will not dirty our garments or cause them to stench.
We do like pie, Ritchie.<eos> You know what else we like? Respect.<eos> We're not selling tickets.<eos> - Now, if you come to us as a friend...<eos> - then tickets will rain down on you.<eos> Then may I give you this pie as a friend?<eos> - I love this guy.<eos> - Nice.<eos> Hey, Ted. Wow.<eos> Look at all these tickets We think Ritchie is counterfeiting them.
Not yet.<eos> He's on his way to be trained in the gift.<eos> Then perhaps when you return from the Palace, you can help us eradicate the Mriswith.<eos> I have to get there first.<eos> There is one way.<eos> These Baka-Ban dogs have been raiding our village.<eos> Liar!<eos> We came here to make peace!<eos> There's a rock half a league from here.<eos> Take a few ot hese prisoners and chain them to it.
Yes.<eos> Our village is protected from the Mriswith. How do we get there?<eos> It's just across the river.<eos> But the Majendie destroyed the only bridge.<eos> Is there somewhere else we can cross?<eos> At the mud flats.<eos> Past the Lurra Caves?<eos> That's where Captain Takoda said the Mriswith are nesting.<eos> Where are the prisoners?<eos> They took them and fled.
Thank you so much for the wonderful memories.<eos> - Everybody take their stuff and go. - Ooh, ooh, ooh. Can we do one funny-face one?<eos> Do you have that picture that Andy took?<eos> Maybe I'll run it without any text.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I tried to Photoshop it to make it look like they were happy.<eos> It was really hard.<eos> Their mouths are so old. God!<eos> Look at these horrible men.<eos> You know, I don't even know if I want them in my catalog.
Money will get us through.<eos> I got some American brothers visiting.<eos> Alright, we're good.<eos> Send them through.<eos> All right, truck, move.<eos> We'll pass through first.<eos> And they'll check your IDs.<eos> Shouldn't be a problem.<eos> What the hell do we do now?<eos> He paid them off.
I want you to take this.<eos> This is Jeremy's pocket watch.<eos> How did you get it?<eos> I took it from Damon who took it from Logan who must have taken it from you.<eos> - What happened to it?<eos> - Well, it's not just a watch. It's a sort of compass, but it points to vampires.<eos> Why did my father have it?<eos> The Gilberts were one of the founding families, and back in 1864 they were among those who sought to eradicate the vampires.<eos> The compass was used to find us.<eos> Did you know them?
You don't think...<eos> Oh, my dear boy, you are living in a never-never land.<eos> You don't think you've saved a single life.<eos> What do you know about a protest movement anyway?<eos> You're a fake.<eos> We did an advertising campaign for peace, can you understand that? No, I can't.<eos> It shouts of vulgar and self-aggrandisement.<eos> Are you advertising John Lennon or peace?<eos> You want nice middle-class gestures for peace?<eos> Manifestos written by a lot of half-witted intellectuals and nobody reads them.
People always think my job is so difficult. But...<eos> Being a parent is the toughest job of all.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Take care.<eos> Any luck? Hey.<eos> Couple of prints.<eos> Probably belong to the guy at the pawnshop though.<eos> Oh, I forgot, we need diapers. Yeah, what else is new?<eos> We need wipes.<eos> I'll pick them up on the way home.
Diss--sounds like a kid.<eos> Who else would pit schools against each other?<eos> Reckless teenage competition.<eos> The school that logs the most high time this Friday wins.<eos> Friday, tomorrow.<eos> Get your friends on board.<eos> Practice makes the high last longer.<eos> Gotta do it alone and video it with your webcam And upload it to the site for it to count.<eos> Doing it alone requires ligatures.<eos> He's basically encouraging them to play the deadliest form of the game With no one there to revive them.
The kid has been choked and revived on multiple occasions.<eos> You said the father worked for the fire department, right?<eos> Yeah, for a couple of months now.<eos> In what capacity?<eos> As an emt.<eos> Emt.<eos> That's our unsub.<eos> Christopher didn't even understand The wiping systems on his computer.<eos> So the father poses as a classmate And invites local kids to join the game.<eos> Bumps up the stakes and encourages them To use their riskiest methods.
Where's our friend?<eos> I don't know!<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> You don't need a lawyer, Claudia. You need a magician.<eos> It's pretty much the only chance you have of making your fingerprints disappear from the vials of morphine we found at the scene.<eos> Frederico was hurt bad.<eos> He-he needed to go to the hospital.<eos> But your brothers wouldn't allow that, would they?<eos> I knew he wasn't going to make it.<eos> But I thought if I just helped them this... this one time...
We appreciate that, sir, But the woman that we're looking for Has lost her ability to control her obsession.<eos> She's killed 3 women trying to recreate a type of doll She had as a child.<eos> Describe the line to me.<eos> Well, there's a pattern to the victims.<eos> They're in their 20s, and they're petite.<eos> Most doll lines revolve around infants.<eos> Is she dressing them like babies?<eos> No, she's not.<eos> Their wardrobe consists of chiffon dresses, Worn by one blond woman, a redhead, and a black woman.<eos> The dresses-is she sewing them herself?
Your table is ready.<eos> So you two working a homicide?<eos> Um, a double homicide.<eos> It's actually a rather tricky case because the killer is...<eos> I like to call him the third man.<eos> Very mysterious.<eos> It sounds like one of your books.<eos> Yeah, it kinda does.<eos> Anyway, he and his two partners...<eos> Were gonna rob a bank, only he turned on the other two and killed them before they even finished the job.
All tools of the diamond trade.<eos> So what happened, Mr. du Preez?<eos> Because we think someone broke into your store, came down the dumbwaiter shaft and stole your shipment of diamonds.<eos> Now that's your problem.<eos> My problem is that they left two bodies behind.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> You don't want to implicate yourself.<eos> I get it.<eos> I'm simply gonna ask, who knew about the shipment?<eos> Come on, Mr. du Preez. Don't you want us to find them?
I'm simply gonna ask, who knew about the shipment?<eos> Come on, Mr. du Preez. Don't you want us to find them?<eos> Who knew?<eos> Who did you tell?<eos> I told no one.<eos> Mr. du Preez--<eos> I picked up my cargo at the airport personally, And I locked 'em in my office.<eos> The next day, they were gone.<eos> Do you recognize either of these men?<eos> No. I've never seen any of them in my life.
Thank you. But there is a fine line between doing what's right and doing what's right for your candidate.<eos> And you need to come to me first next time, because if we can't trust each other, - then we can't work together.<eos> - W... wait a minute.<eos> You're... you're keeping her on the payroll after what she's...<eos> Robert, I appreciate your opinion, but, yes, I need Buffy.<eos> And I hate to tell you this, Buffy, - but you're gonna be workingall night.<eos> - What am I missin'?<eos> Well, I have found a venue for my announcement.<eos> Okay. Someone want to clue me in?<eos> As you know, I'm running on family values, so I've decided to do it here, where I learned them.
There was one exchange student.<eos> She's like the child whisperer, okay?<eos> Let her focus on Cooper, you focus on the match.<eos> - We'll be fine.<eos> Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Go Team Kev-rah.<eos> Where are those guys?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You think we scared them off? Robert?
How you holding up today?<eos> Still upset, I see.<eos> "clothes over psychos" Coming this fall to prisons everywhere.<eos> Hey, brooke.<eos> Alexander coyne.<eos> Millicent huxtable. Nice to meet you.<eos> Do you need help with anything?<eos> Just ask victoria... 'cause you work for her.<eos> You're a mean boss.<eos> You're like an evil disney character Who feeds her servants porridge and pays them in buttons.
I need a few minutes with your friend.<eos> Or stay if you want.<eos> Rectal exam.<eos> I'll check out the cafeteria.<eos> Why the beta blockers?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Valium and Xanax actually reduce stress.<eos> Beta blockers just control the symptoms of stress.<eos> Keep the heart from racing, hands from shaking, and all those stage fright issues.<eos> That's why some people take them when they perform.
Mother.<eos> Mother.<eos> Oh, spotless woman in a shameless world.<eos> Mongrel.<eos> We are all for protecting family and I,ve seen up close how strong the women of Utah are.<eos> I challenge my opponent, Bill Henrickson, not to stay silent.<eos> He must denounce his wife,s characterization of Utah women as weak-minded drug addicts.<eos> If you ask me, women are Utah,s best natural resource.<eos> Mr. Henrickson, we don,t need lectures on Utah values.<eos> We live them.
It's pretty hot out there.<eos> Listen, know any good pest control companies?<eos> Pest control?<eos> Here's one. "Squeaky Klean Service."<eos> Squeaky Klean Service?<eos> Let me just write that down.<eos> Haying problems with mice?<eos> Maybe it's mice, or maybe it's something else.<eos> Between us, it's little people.<eos> I've seen them myself.
Let me out!<eos> Help me!<eos> The ceiling's tilted.<eos> Hello?<eos> Squeaky Klean Service?<eos> Can you make an urgent house call?<eos> There's something small in the house.<eos> No, not mice.<eos> Not mice?<eos> I don't want them killed.
Maybe he just didn't need to.<eos> Or we haven't found his other victims yet.<eos> We think he was screwing nancy way back when?<eos> He was having an affair with renee simmons.<eos> He could have killed them both to cover up his dalliances.<eos> Or some other secret they learned during pillow talk.<eos> And daniel hardy takes the fall.<eos> Anything in nancy pierce's case file that can help us?<eos> There are vouchers for blood and semen From her body.<eos> Got the property clerk looking for them now.
Thank you for everything.<eos> - I just wish there was more we could do.<eos> - There is.<eos> Ingrid block.<eos> Detective stabler.<eos> - You're under arrest for facilitating a murder.<eos> Elliot, what are you doing?<eos> - I'm getting justice for renee simmons.<eos> She put the murder weapon right back In richard morgan's hands.<eos> - So do you understand your rights As I've explained them to you?
Woodhous are you ready, or what?<eos> Woodhouse: yes, quite ready,<eos> Sir, though not entirely willing.<eos> And I don't know if I am, either.<eos> Trinette: could have fooled me!<eos> It's perfectly safe.<eos> You're tangoing, then your Trained field-agent eyes spot two threats.<eos> But they're not trained.<eos> We haven't done this yet.<eos> Archer: this is how you train them.
This is Laya.<eos> Hey.<eos> Zach!<eos> Zach!<eos> Come here, Zach!<eos> Zach!<eos> Oh... She had a stroke.<eos> She's still unconscious, but stable.<eos> Which hospital?<eos> Harbor. The kids couldn't get through to 911, so Becca drove them there.
Where is he?<eos> Last I saw Sayif, he was in the hangar.<eos> You've been his flight instructor the whole time?<eos> Oh, no. He's been through several.<eos> I've only had the pleasure for the past, uh, couple weeks.<eos> I detect some... friction.<eos> Let's just say that I hope he doesn't screw up on his check ride.<eos> That way, he'll graduate the day after tomorrow, with his class, and he won't be our problem anymore.<eos> I was just making arrangements to be picked up.<eos> Cancel them.
How about if we order dinner, and I let you choose what you want?<eos> How long are you gonna be staying in our house?<eos> Last I checked, it's my house too.<eos> I have a whole bedroom.<eos> You used to have a whole bedroom.<eos> It's my special space now.<eos> Candice, can you... come and move the couch on the left... like, oh, one inch towards the window?<eos> - Hey, Candice.<eos> - Hey, Aura.<eos> Some boxes came for you, so I put them in your bedroom.
He's really important to me, And this is him right here.<eos> âª your minds are blown âª<eos> So why are we going to be looking into your friend's gs?<eos> For lucy.<eos> Look, I know ben's real to you. But your patients are always gonna be real, And the truth is, there are gonna be many a times<eos> Where you're gonna have to hurt them in order to help them, Like I'm doing with my friend here.<eos> I'll let you retake the test again tonight.<eos> You ready?<eos> Do blue crabs whistle?<eos> They do, when you boil them alive.
Are you even allowed to ask me that?<eos> See, mike just couldn't play the game the way you have to In an interview.<eos> He just didn't have it in him.<eos> Look, I be a manager, I'm a hardworker, I've never been late in my life.<eos> What else do you need to know?<eos> What superhero quality would you find Most valuable to you in the workplace.<eos> Flying, invisibility Or stretching to extreme lengths?<eos> So brick forgot the flyers.<eos> Big surprise.<eos> I guess kinda my fault, 'cause I put them On top of his backpack instead of inside it.
So to make drew happy,<eos> I have to start wearing tutus and prom dresses? That would look adorable, but no.<eos> Just throw on something sexy once in a while, you know?<eos> Show him you care.<eos> (high-pitched british accent) anyone fancy a swim?<eos> That's how they sound.<eos> (laughing) that is the way they sound.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Hey, cole, you know how when we make love,<eos> I can't look into your eyes because they're so empty And soulless, so I just cover them with my hands?
Hey, drew! "you better recognize"?<eos> It's something people said in the '90s.<eos> Cool people?<eos> No.<eos> (woman) recognize!<eos> (all) recognize!<eos> Yes, hello.<eos> It's me.<eos> (under breath) how could this be any worse?<eos> (crying) scientists taught horses to talk, And it turns out because we've ridden them all these years, They don't like humans!
hey, buddy, you like italian ice?<eos> hey, watch your mouth!<eos> She's only 34 years old!<eos> what's wrong with me?<eos> first, i don't want to go to strip clubs, and then i get angry at the hilarious dude that says something awesome.<eos> there's nothing wrongwith you, sir.<eos> it's just you're treating sue like family now.<eos> that makes you feel protective of her.<eos> but i'm not like that with my sons.<eos> when they were little, i threw them in the deep end of our pool to help them get over their fearof sharks.
Um, heavy breathing, moaning.<eos> Made you want to take a hand sanitizer shower.<eos> Seems a little immature for grad students.<eos> Look, I'm studying the impact of A.I.D.S. treatments in inner-city clinics.<eos> Kelly's is about overcoming the glass ceiling.<eos> And Jessica was watching a dominatrix dig her stiletto into some loser's chest.<eos> She was bound to get some grief for it. ah.<eos> Jessica's notes on Venom's sessions are pretty detailed.<eos> She studied these guys like lab rats.<eos> But she only identifies them by nickname--"ladyboy,"
- It's cute, right?<eos> - Yeah. It makes my tits look like a present.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Where are we on essex street?<eos> I talked to miguel this morning And he says the wall unit looks awesome.<eos> - And the bolsters?<eos> - Oh, f-- shit.<eos> You forgot my custom bolsters.<eos> And here I thought you were perfect.<eos> I'll get them on the way to my lunch.
Is this serious enough?<eos> What makes you assume I'd know anything about fashion?<eos> Touchy. Jesus.<eos> Change your tampon. I was just asking a question.<eos> It's very dark. Thought you hated those boots.<eos> Well, I still hate them, but I think they look like spy boots.<eos> You're really gonna be a spy?<eos> It says "capital," as in "state capital,"<eos> and "surveillance."<eos> And when I called them today, they seemed very secretive.
theyhadtwobottles of some kind of unusual-looking substance on the roof of that car right there, and one of them is...<eos> I'm not really sure, and the other one is,<eos> I really don't know what it is.<eos> youknow, I don't see any marijuana in it.<eos> it's alcohol, yeah.<eos> hesaidit 'sherbalmedicine.<eos> yeah,itis .<eos> We do this in Asia, Larry.<eos> We make this in asia.<eos> We take all kinds of very powerful herbs, and we mix them in with a very, very strong vodka.
Spin around.<eos> Spreadyourlegs.<eos> Spread your legs.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> Yourleg,man.<eos> Your leg.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah, spread.<eos> Theseguysmightbe drug dealers.<eos> Drug dealers usually carry guns, so we're patting them down.
Please help us.<eos> Please. My husband. He's been hurt.<eos> Please help him.<eos> What are you two doing out here?<eos> - It's not safe.<eos> - No. No, sir.<eos> It's not safe.<eos> And that's how it's done.<eos> What happens to the bodies?<eos> We'll take them into the woods. The other animals will finish them off.
- Five minutes!<eos> - Yes!<eos> But that's all, cos I'm telling you now, that woman is not dragging me into anything!<eos> What caused it to crash?<eos> Not me.<eos> The airlock would've sealed seconds after you blew it.<eos> According to the Home Box, the warp engines had a phase-shift.<eos> No survivors.<eos> A phase-shift would have to be sabotage.<eos> I did warn them.
I love you, too, man.<eos> And tell Candace I love her, too, okay?<eos> But not in a creepy way.<eos> And tell Maxine--hi, Maxine--<eos> Her blond hair's like a lighthouse in the darkness.<eos> I love lighthouses.<eos> And, Alex, please tell my family to come, Okay? Absolutely.<eos> They're already on their way.<eos> You can talk to them about lighthouses, whatever you want.<eos> No, I need to tell them that I love them, okay, and that I got shot, and I'm scared.
You know, I...<eos> I say my dad died from smoking.<eos> You lose your father at 13.<eos> In many ways, you feel that it's your fault.<eos> - Let's go back to...<eos> - Well, it was my fault.<eos> No.<eos> Hold up for a second, okay?<eos> Let's go back to that day.<eos> The paramedics, the firefighters... when you looked at them, what did you see?
Happy anniversary.<eos> It's the ring!<eos> Oh, you went back to that antique shop.<eos> Yep.<eos> Oh, thank you!<eos> Wait till you see your present.<eos> You can unwrap it tonight when the kids are asleep.<eos> Or how about after they leave for school?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, why are they still up there and why can't I hear them?
The car thief had gang tats.<eos> I got friends in gang squad.<eos> I'm gonna reach out.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You're gonna get yourself together, You're gonna go for counseling --<eos> I'm setting it up -- and you're gonna go, you understand?<eos> Yeah, I'll go, but we're gonna get these guys, right?<eos> Mac, of course we are.<eos> I've got every cop in the city on it.<eos> I find them, I'll kill them all myself.
I can't... I can't tell you.<eos> He's family, man.<eos> I know you know.<eos> I'm not asking.<eos> They'll kill me if I say anything!<eos> And you think I won't.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> I do the chop job.<eos> I collect the Vin numbers, And this guy blue buys them off me. That's all I know!
Dude, stop singing!<eos> I'm trying to get you to understand the seriousness of the problem.<eos> I've lost my upper register completely.<eos> Dr. Karev, this is Mr. Mafrici, your consult.<eos> I just need some antibiotics.<eos> I open in Tosca in a week. - And he gave me bronchitis.<eos> - I did not give this to you.<eos> Take a deep breath.<eos> He teaches piano to children.<eos> I can hear them hacking away during their lessons, and then he comes in the house and touches things.
It is my cousin Emma who would like to try something on. Oh...<eos> Perhaps the green, Emma?<eos> I don't think I have ever seen you in chartreuse.<eos> But look at how much it costs.<eos> You can afford it. Go on.<eos> Don't you want to see yourself in such a dress?<eos> Shouldn't my ma wait until the Chancery money arrives?<eos> Yes, and our sale will be over by then, I'm certain.<eos> I'm sure, as Mrs Timmins may soon be your neighbour, perhaps a regular customer, you would not wish to miss this moment to introduce her to your services.<eos> Our services are of course available to any customer who can afford them.
I have done no more than barter with my Creator, seeking to please Him in order that He might give me what I want.<eos> But, Thomas, what is it that you want?<eos> For the Almighty to bless us with a child.<eos> Is that so bad?<eos> It is clear now the Lord intends all to be as it is.<eos> We shall no more endeavour.<eos> There the matter begins and ends.<eos> Usually, when a man avoids you, it's because there's something he doesn't want to say.<eos> I in't no right to speak the thoughts that are washing round in my mind, sir.<eos> Suppose I want to hear them?
So what do we do?<eos> Fill a wagon with earth, shovel it in, pack it down hard and that should cap it off.<eos> Great. Well, do that, then get that lot up there to help and you'd better come back to the house.<eos> I think we should talk further.<eos> Go!<eos> We know where Greg is.<eos> They're both here, both your friends.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> They've been made to work at Mr Smithson's coal mine.<eos> Billy brings them here... .. people that he finds on the road.

So... Mrs Grant, how long have you known Greg?<eos> You know, we have a chance to start civilisation all over again, and of all possible courses, you choose slavery.<eos> I'm sure our descendants will look back on us with shame, but from what I remember of the old world, as long as it happens out of sight, no-one cares too much.<eos> Well, you seem to have found a set of people who agree with you.<eos> Who wouldn't rather be a master than a slave... if that were the only choice?<eos> He must have stolen the key when I tried to help him.<eos> Get off him!<eos> Get back!<eos> We just came here for our friends.<eos> Just let us collect them and we'll leave and never come back.
He was discharged a few years back.<eos> He killed someone, didn't he?<eos> Driving too fast in an unmarked car.<eos> A teenage girl - got an 18-month suspended sentence.<eos> Got slung out of the force for that one.<eos> No light. No siren.<eos> The girl didn't stand a chance.<eos> Yeah, well, it could've happened to any of us.<eos> Shouldn't we get these cards to...?<eos> Yeah, we'll get them to the lab.
You wouldn't throw them out.<eos> Where does he keep his food?<eos> Down on the left side of the pantry.<eos> You know who would stop at nothing to win?<eos> Those two.<eos> Ask them about the book deal they've been chasing.<eos> A competition prize would help that, no?<eos> Okay, fine, arrest me.<eos> But I didn't steal the truffles, okay?<eos> I rescued them from a terrible, terrible fate.
My dad took me to a doctor who said I was suffering from lack of serotonin to the brain.<eos> They gave me pills and I zombied out for six months and watched game shows.<eos> I know you probably think I'm a manipulative bitch for sleeping with two guys, but try looking at it this way:<eos> The sexual revolution is just like any other revolution... there's gonna be casualties.<eos> - Good evening, Mr. Wexler.<eos> - She's busy studying.<eos> Well, can I just say a quick hello?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Well, it's just I... I brought her all these cupcakes.<eos> My mom baked them, and I thought it would be a nice gesture.
- Yes.<eos> - Why was I hiding behind the plant?<eos> [laughs] well, in college, I took a botany class,<eos> And there was lots of drama in that class.<eos> Uh, kids would gossip about me, So I would eavesdrop on them<eos> By hiding behind different plants<eos> In the botany class.<eos> And then they would say things like, "oh, this guy's gonna fail this class,"<eos> Or, "what's this guy doing Spying on us from behind plants?"<eos> And then I would jump out at them and confront them
All right, let's do this.<eos> Jeff, do you know what you are?<eos> You're special.<eos> You're very special, Jeff.<eos> You're the most special little boy in the world.<eos> Take her back to harbor.<eos> Flank the sheets and trim the headsail.<eos> Eyes on me for a moment.<eos> I don't see students here, I see seamen.<eos> And I didn't create them.
Don't trust the foreigners.<eos> Let's eat.<eos> Ramos!<eos> Ramos!<eos> Ramos!<eos> Ramos!<eos> Be well.<eos> Just give away the rest to the kids.<eos> Thanks for everything, Major.<eos> You're not going to see them?
Let's eat.<eos> Ramos!<eos> Ramos!<eos> Ramos!<eos> Ramos!<eos> Be well.<eos> Just give away the rest to the kids.<eos> Thanks for everything, Major.<eos> You're not going to see them?<eos> It wouldn't be easy if I saw them.
- Do you have dogs?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Kids. Lots of kids.<eos> - Kids love dogs.<eos> Well, my boys are allergic.<eos> - Zyrtec. - We don't take pills in our family.<eos> By the way, your husband's testicles have migrated.<eos> - Migrated?<eos> - We'll let you know as soon as we find them.
But I own the spotlight.<eos> Don't push it.<eos> Announcer : We have an accident on the track.<eos> Everyone please remain calm, stay seated, Let the emergency crews do what they do best.<eos> All right, if anything changes either way, give me a shout. Thanks.<eos> I've watched davi santos race for years. Get out!<eos> Didn't know you were a motorhead.<eos> The man's a legend.<eos> Your legend's over at trinity general... Right now, in critical condition.<eos> These drivers wear suits... That protect them from 700 degrees celsius heat.
Came out of nowhere.<eos> The lamppost?<eos> The lamppost came out of nowhere? Right.<eos> They have a tendency to do that When you're driving up on the sidewalk.<eos> This is what I'm saying.<eos> Mr. Gordon, you never reported<eos> The car accident. Is there a reason for that?<eos> I'm reporting it to you now.<eos> Look, do you remember these guys?<eos> You dropped them off at a bar over on ludlow last night.
Here's the thing about Jeff.<eos> Wow.<eos> Chasing after you made him a better person because you always call him on his stuff.<eos> All this time, you've been warming him up and stirring in sweetener, and making him just right.<eos> And sure, you weren't ready to take a sip yet. But it didn't mean you want somebody to snatch him off the counter, guzzle him down in front of you.<eos> Shirley, I did not warm Jeff up.<eos> Nobody ever will.<eos> Do you think Professor Slater is getting flowers right now?<eos> Do you think they are gonna go to the movies and hold hands? Visit her parents?<eos> No. The only thing keeping them going was the thrill of the secrecy. And now that it is out, it is over.
Justice for a murder victim.<eos> By avoiding my question, you just answered it.<eos> I just hope for all our sakes, you know what you're doing.<eos> Join the club.<eos> 6 of the jurors look convinced Clara is guilty<eos> Just from the opening arguments.<eos> You could see approval on their faces Every time the prosecutor talked.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But these 2 are for the defense. And they've already emerged as leaders.<eos> Jurors 6, 7, and 11 were looking at them the whole time, Gauging their reaction.
Get a mani-pedi, wax your lady business, you know, whatever it is, do it for yourself- not for him.<eos> WOMAN Thank you, Cate.<eos> I know you're right.<eos> Yeah, or else, before you know it, you're wandering down the aisles of supermarkets scrounging for free samples in your give-ups.<eos> Give-ups?<eos> Yeah, sweatpants.<eos> Sweats in public are give-ups. No matter how cute they are or what they say across the ass, because that's what you're telling the world-<eos> "I give up and I'm hungry."<eos> Hey, sweatpants are a perfectly comfortable option.<eos> I wear them, Michelle Obama wears them.

Spilling everything I know.<eos> All my secrets Being blathered out into a world that should never hear them.<eos> So, "when the time comes,"<eos> As you put it, there's something you can do.<eos> You can smother me with a pillow.<eos> Make sure it's synthetic.<eos> I'm allergic to feathers.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, the birds will be so happy!<eos> The delivery man just left them out front, And I just couldn't move them.
Because she can't trust me with her feelings.<eos> Because... I am too hard on her.<eos> There it is.<eos> Now I don't trust myself.<eos> Now it is in my hands, and the stone knows it...<eos> Yes, you can be hard... on all of us.<eos> But I have seen you more forgiving than any man I know.<eos> I have seen you trying to adapt yourself to our needs, trying to understand the ways of women and girls.<eos> These are night thoughts, Robert.<eos> The daylight will wash them away.
[Arizona] These loops of bowel look clean, too.<eos> - [Alex] Nothing.<eos> - [Arizona] Nothing.<eos> [Alex] Crap. I bullied them into totally unnecessary surgery for their kid.<eos> [Arizona] lt wasn't unnecessary.<eos> By not finding anything, we're one step closer to finding out what isn't wrong with Brad.<eos> Which means we're one step closer to finding out what is.<eos> At least, that's what you're gonna tell his angry parents.<eos> - Me?<eos> - You bullied them into surgery. You take the heat.
Let me ask him right now.<eos> Hey, Ed.<eos> Attorney General... what's he want?<eos> He wants to send in the Feds.<eos> So, that's not a rumor? No, no, he's deadly serious.<eos> Nobody needs the Feds poking around in our city business.<eos> Yeah, no kidding.<eos> You got police departments, budgets, operations.<eos> Everything gets dissected. Cops get handcuffed.<eos> And once you get them in, you can't get them out.
Everybody knows you. You'll push the rules a little, bend them one way, maybe even break the law to get what you want.<eos> But you're not dirty, Frank, and you never will be.<eos> So, this is all bull, and I'm not falling for it.<eos> Thanks for the drink.<eos> Now what?<eos> The johns set up dates by calling an answering machine.<eos> So all's we got to do is call that number about a half-dozen times.<eos> We can round these cops up all in one place and put a stop to this thing.<eos> Internal Affairs. Step out of the car, please.<eos> So, you get them all?

The... The only reason I pulled the fire alarm was because I had to pick my boyfriend up from the airport.<eos> Oh, that makes perfect sense.<eos> I know I sound crazy right now, but it really was the only way.<eos> I needed more than the allotted 60-minute lunch break to get to the airport and back, and...<eos> Renee's desk is right in the middle of the floor.<eos> She sees everything.<eos> Okay, correct me if I am wrong.<eos> Renee was the receptionist. More like office nazi.<eos> My boyfriend said that he called a dozen times yesterday, but I never got any of the messages.<eos> Why not? Little miss hall monitor never gave them to me.
Did lightman ever blow the whistle?<eos> His life was in serious danger.<eos> See, that doesn't sound like lightman.<eos> A lot of what lightman does these days Is because of what... He didn't do back then.<eos> So I was almost killed by a terrorist Who is after lightman.<eos> Jimmy Doyle killed Andrews.<eos> You could be next, Dr. Lightman.<eos> I don't talk to people whose faces I can't see.<eos> You want the tapes back or not?<eos> How do I know you've even got them?
Performances?<eos> Yeah, she's a, she's a musician.<eos> What kind of musician?<eos> She plays cello in the Miami Phil. Why?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Page Dr. Zambrano.<eos> Tell her to meet me in Emily Palmer's room.<eos> I think she took beta-blockers.<eos> I read about this in med school.<eos> 30% of classical musicians take them for performance anxiety.
I left some messages.<eos> He's so young.<eos> Young with a big bag of cash.<eos> Maybe he's a waiter.<eos> Must be some restaurant.<eos> Tips like that could have me rethinking my career.<eos> I just wish I knew his name. You know, what his story was.<eos> There it goes again!<eos> The spasms?<eos> See? I gotta figure out what's causing them.
Not like it's a competition or anything.<eos> Because if it was, I would win.<eos> But that's neither here nor there.<eos> The point is I would win.<eos> How long will they be closed?<eos> With the government shut down, who is going to stop Al-Qaeda?<eos> One thing at a time.<eos> School is out in two weeks.<eos> What am I going to do with my kids all day?<eos> Keep them in my house?
Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because jimmy burger is an example of what happens When you try running the show on your own.<eos> Don't.<eos> Jones: neal.<eos> Here's the info on those names you asked me to check out.<eos> Unbelievable. it's like talking to a wall.<eos> I hadn't heard your story yet.<eos> Let me see.<eos> They're all members of doctoral global initiative.<eos> If powell's charity is supplying organs, Maybe this is how he finds them.
Did they say why?<eos> They say they found a more urgent recipient.<eos> And you --<eos> Yes. i scouted the clinic.<eos> Something's got them spooked.<eos> Employees have been throwing files into the garbage all day.<eos> You see what the files were?<eos> I couldn't. It's pretty upscale.<eos> private security everywhere.<eos> [ sighs ] Any idea what's got them rattled?
it'll be enough. Okay, what do we start with?<eos> Let's see the workup on him.<eos> Okay. one of the symptoms is headaches.<eos> We can swap his glasses.<eos> I have a friend who wears glasses.<eos> Trust me, we swap them out, he'll know.<eos> Fatigue.<eos> Weight loss.<eos> According to his file, he dropped off a suit To have it dry-cleaned for an event this tuesday night.<eos> The day before powell's due in, we'll pick up his clothes and swap them out for a larger size.
All right.<eos> Everybody just relax.<eos> The plane is this way.<eos> If you put down the guns, I'll take you there.<eos> Can I assume that you know what will happen to your beautiful friends if you're lying?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Even if we take them to the gold, they're still going to kill us.
I can answer that last one.<eos> At any rate, I ain't leaving, bo Crowder notwithstanding.<eos> Hello!<eos> Good morning, sunshine.<eos> What's up?<eos> Well, I was gonna apologize for being late.<eos> For what?<eos> You know that little cellphone thing that we issue to all the marshals?<eos> You should turn that on once in a while, check your messages.<eos> You want me to check them now?
It'll help us when they come to auction.<eos> I could have done that from my office. Sorry.<eos> I didn't think of that.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Oh, uh, and we want you to include the Hitler paintings.<eos> Really? I was -<eos> - I thought Owen burned those in the fireplace.<eos> It turns out whatever was burned in the fireplace wasn't one of those paintings.<eos> Really?<eos> We don't know where the paintings are, but we got a team looking for them.
It is.<eos> It is.<eos> Except for this.<eos> This upgrade here.<eos> - It's here.<eos> Look.<eos> - Upgrade?<eos> John, who did this to you?<eos> Her scientists did.<eos> I heard them saying something about slamming a chip in the back so they could control everything that I do.
I'm sorry.<eos> Really. But you know we have to do this.<eos> We're putting them in the storage unit.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Come on!<eos> - Jane, is that everyone?<eos> Okay, then. Get the kerosene.<eos> What?<eos> There are kids in there.<eos> The angels named them for a reason.
I can't see well in this bright light.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Isn't it too dark?<eos> Tong, fetch the light in my room.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - By my bed.<eos> I see you started taking pictures again.<eos> I've kept myself busy.<eos> The workers come and go.<eos> Sometimes, I envy them.
Someone did our job for us.<eos> Meet me in Pündtün.<eos> We'll make sure Arnaldo and his new friends never talk.<eos> Chuck, what were you thinking?<eos> You apprehended Juan Diego Arnaldo without contacting me first?<eos> Well, yes, technically, but...<eos> Your part in this little impromptu mission is over.<eos> I'll arrange for Arnaldo to be picked up by a different Interpol team.<eos> Try not to physically assault them.<eos> General, we didn't hit them or assault them in any way.
This is just need-to-know information.<eos> Am I supposed to enjoy the irony or pity the sincerity.<eos> Well it's making me homesick.<eos> This is what a party back home looked like.<eos> With food people actually enjoy.<eos> You don't think I have to bite my tongue Every time I carry a tray With Santa Barbara grilled eel beaks<eos> In a baby pinecone sauce... All right, listen up people.<eos> Hand over your cell phones.<eos> I tried to be nice, But it clearly isn't effective management strategy.<eos> So I'll hand them over after the event.
They're not sexy.<eos> Bring the lights down, and the music's gotta change.<eos> Sexual drive resides in the hypothalamus, So what you want is a beat that kinda stimulates that.<eos> People around here are sipping, Like what you're doing right now.<eos> They need to get fucking smashed.<eos> They gotta down 'em.<eos> Gotta get that goin', I have some ideas.<eos> But most important thing<eos> You wanna find your fuck actives,<eos> Cluster them together.
Ah!<eos> We should totally phone Gaspard!<eos> Ah! He would love to hear this tale!<eos> Oh, but I only have 15 pfenigs on my phone card.<eos> Happy Gerbitz Day. Ah!<eos> Oh, it is so good to have my boys back home safe and sound.<eos> Thank God for that psychic.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The psychic didn't do anything.<eos> Well, she said we were gonna find them and we did.
* But if you want a lady's love * * You're better off by smelling of * * A gentleman's cologne instead of sneakers and stool *<eos> * A squirt, a spurt *<eos> * Of something' just for Ellen * * And you'll see that she will find you so compelling' *<eos> * And she does because * * The only smell that she'll be smellin' * * Won't be coming from your bum *<eos> * You wanna take that little whore * * And spin her on the dancing floor * * But boy, before you do a single twirl *<eos> * You must impress that effervescing * * Self-possessing, no BS-ing *<eos> * Down's Syndrome girl *<eos> * Her eyes are emerald portals * * To a secret land of love * * And her smile is like the sweetest summer flower *<eos> * Her kiss is so inviting * * And her hugs are so delighting *<eos> * And what makes them really nice * * Is that they've got a little spice * * Because they're tighter than a vice *
Godson told me you woke him up last night because you needed the phone.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Why?<eos> - l needed the phone<eos> Who do you think you are?<eos> You're a cocksucker, how come you go and ask him for the phone?<eos> Wait a bit.<eos> You owe me T packs of cigarettes...<eos> now you owe me 10.<eos> And I want them today, or I'll be real mad.
Don't be stupid!<eos> It's not me.<eos> (I know who it is! )<eos> Was Minami really alone at the pool that day?<eos> There are two students responsible.<eos> I'll refer to them as 'A' and 'B'.<eos> 'A' is a straight As student.<eos> Looking at him, you wouldn't expect him to have any problems at all.<eos> But...there are some fairly unsettling rumours you hear from time to time...<eos> Since he was in junior school, he's been picking up stray cats and dogs and taking them home to kill with his Execution Machine.
Yeah, okay.<eos> All right, I'm sorry.<eos> I forgot who I was dealing with.<eos> Stay and just have another drink.<eos> Look at me, Jack.<eos> Look how my body goes with this dress.<eos> I don't need to be dealing with amateurs.<eos> Listen, Frank. I really need a ride home from the doctor on Valentine's Day. Are you free?<eos> No, that cleaning lady finally agreed to go out with me.<eos> We're going to pick up some pierogies and then, eat them at her husband's grave.
Yeah.<eos> I'll page Psych, have 'em come down for a consult.<eos> Put a rush on it; if we don't get into his chest soon...<eos> He's gonna be a dead duck.<eos> Well, good news, Lori.<eos> Ultrasound's clear.<eos> No clots in your upper extremity veins. You ruptured your eardrum in the crash.<eos> That's painful, but... that'll heal.<eos> Then what's that face for?<eos> What face? The same one my students make when I catch them texting in class.
Craig Mangold's dead?<eos> Found him at the side of your house.<eos> That's two murders with premeditation.<eos> Suddenly, this becomes a death penalty case.<eos> I'm not saying anything else...<eos> You were an officer, not a grunt.<eos> If Zuna and Mangold came after you and you killed them in self-defense, there's a good chance you walk away from this, but you've got to get out in front of it now.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> Not even in Fallujah?<eos> Officers said you led them into an ambush.
What I'd like to try is regression therapy.<eos> We take Sarah back to a past life And see if we can figure out what made your hands bleed.<eos> Is it--is it dangerous?<eos> No.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> I'll be monitoring her carefully through the whole process, But we will need your permission.<eos> Hi.<eos> I like your stripes.<eos> They're my good-luck socks.<eos> My mom gave them to me.
Come on.<eos> And Amy's got a little surprise for you.<eos> I thought I'd brighten things up to thank you for saving me last night.<eos> Ah!<eos> I thought you might like, you know, possibly to perhaps paint them or something?<eos> Might be a thought.<eos> - Yes. They're not my favourite flower.<eos> - YOU don't like sunflowers?<eos> - No, it's not that I don't like them.<eos> I find them complex.
These guys got in somehow, right? I don't know...<eos> I mean, maybe, like, a P.A. or a writer.<eos> They're always complaining about money.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Check this out.<eos> It's an interactive seating chart, okay?<eos> Yellow squares... that's what we call camera candy.<eos> Hot actors, reality stars.<eos> You know, the people you want to tune in to, to see.<eos> Then, the red squares... well, let's just say that you would recognize them if you've been to dinner theater recently.
Simon is my brother.<eos> What is he talking about?<eos> We're ordering D.N.A. tests.<eos> I've already done that.<eos> Mr. Ramey, I know that.<eos> I sent your swab in yesterday, we'll do Miss Denver's right now And when the tests come back, we'll have our answers.<eos> two and a half years ago-- When Simon Denver disappeared.<eos> When will both D.N.A. tests be back? Thanks.<eos> Uh, in a couple of days.<eos> Um, Russell put them in as a rush.
Play it again.<eos> That's not a short circuit.<eos> That's morse code.<eos> "power."<eos> I know where he is.<eos> Yeah, my buddy's upstate.<eos> Cuts the power when he goes.<eos> It's the perfect hiding place for the jade.<eos> Where are the pieces?<eos> He told me he put them in a drawer.
Okay, bye.<eos> I need the sales report for this quarter.<eos> And the menu revamp that I'm planning, work with JC on that.<eos> I want a modernized Chinese cuisine.<eos> Hey, you're not listening again.<eos> I'm listening, Dad.<eos> I already hired a team to close your shop.<eos> What?<eos> Let's just donate the clothes.<eos> No one's buying them, anyway.
You can't see it from the street.<eos> They have extra locks on the doors.<eos> There's a minivan in the driveway<eos> And a photo of a boy who looks a lot like charlie.<eos> Is he onto you?<eos> Without a doubt.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> Rossi:<eos> Search warrant?<eos> And dogs. If the kids are anywhere near Or in the house, we'll find them.
Hello, little one.<eos> # Among the leaves so green, oh!<eos> Miss Lane says Alf must choose a queen to wear his garland and dance with him when the harvest comes home.<eos> But probably it's the prettiest girl in the harvest that gets chose.<eos> King of the mowers can pick anyone.<eos> Ma, sister, sweetheart...<eos> Or perhaps just some girl who's been bringing him treats in the field.<eos> When you are taking Miss Lane and Little Man their picnic, you might pop a handful of Miss Lane's greengages in the basket.<eos> Alf does love a greengage.<eos> Black-edged cards. Do you sell them?
To love is to lay yourself open to loss.<eos> But that is the bargain we make with ourselves, Thomas.<eos> Because it is worth it.<eos> There will be some black ribbon left over.<eos> Perhaps we should make something.<eos> For the Lark Rise family.<eos> So much black.<eos> It hurts one's eyes after a time.<eos> At least we're not wearing it.<eos> If ever a Lark Rise woman was caught hoarding her best clothes rather than wearing them, she would say that she was saving them, "for high days an' holidays an' bonfire nights".
I don't have any other choice.<eos> All right, Cam Vandemann- he didn't kill anybody. He's in way over his head.<eos> I can hear it in his voice.<eos> He's, he's, he's desperate, Mac.<eos> I'm reminded every day of what it's like to go after a headline without the right kind of help.<eos> Okay, so will you please just go talk to him?<eos> Alone?<eos> When?<eos> Tonight.<eos> I'll text you with the details as soon as he sends them.
This is the former home of the Los Angeles Ledger.<eos> In 1985, it became a house of horrors for three friends, each molested by this man:<eos> Arnold Winslow, a teacher from the children's elementary school.<eos> Winslow lured them on separate occasions and raped them, threatening to kill the boys if they divulged the truth.
In the weeks before your brother died, he and Winslow were talking a lot on the phone.<eos> And those calls went both ways.<eos> Winslow was a shop teacher.<eos> The-the boys loved hearing his stories about being a Marine.<eos> After school, he taught private classes.<eos> The shop was just a couple of blocks from the old Ledger building.<eos> They would, uh, build slot cars and all kinds of cool stuff.<eos> But Winslow had to pick you.<eos> It was a really big deal.<eos> That's how he'd molest them?
You work for Alan.<eos> You're his boy.<eos> Right, I want copies of your licence, finantial records purchase orders, gues lists, the lot.<eos> By tomorrov.<eos> The club was over capacity by 200 tonight.<eos> Are you listening?<eos> He let's everybody in, underaged people, they were all underaged.<eos> Yes, so?<eos> And do you know drugdealers working<eos> - we see them on that...
Entergy says there's still water in the lines.<eos> God, Julie, you're a lifesaver.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Shit.<eos> Shit.<eos> Shit.<eos> Mom is sure, but sheriff says he never had him.<eos> Sheriff said nothing went wrong at o.P.P. Too.<eos> Most o.P.P. Prisoners went to hunt up in San Gabriel.<eos> Yeah, and after hunt d.O.C. Dispersed them. I know that.
Oh, man.<eos> That's tragic, really.<eos> - One of the good gigs, huh?<eos> Bourbon street.<eos> Nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> Pride on bourbon street.<eos> Yeah, that's what they say.<eos> His cousin says He's been squatting here in the Calliope.<eos> We had squatters.<eos> Run them off.
You might be very talented and work like a dog, but unless luck smiles on you at the right moment... your efforts are in vain.<eos> IMMACULATE<eos> Here are the documents.<eos> These are the quasi-final audit results.<eos> How's it look?<eos> 23 million euros in profits: Up 9% for three years running.<eos> That should reassure our American friends.<eos> Why "quasi-final"?<eos> We haven't decided on the building costs.<eos> If we carry them over to next year, it's 28 million, up 11%.
Hi, Jeff.<eos> I brought bagels.<eos> Oh, I'd love a bagel.<eos> The perfect beginning for my first day of billiards class. Oh.<eos> Did you pick a special outfit so you could look sexy shooting pool?<eos> Shirley, I have no idea what you are talking about.<eos> Thirteen.<eos> Oh, great, so much for "baggles."<eos> So much for what?<eos> The "baggles." You dropped them on the floor.
It's insured, it's from New York City.<eos> It's probably from some fancy jewelry store.<eos> I think it is.<eos> Ooh, Ingleman's. Yeah. Hmm.<eos> It's a good one.<eos> Here we go again.<eos> Idiot. He's an idiot for buying his girlfriend jewelry?<eos> Expensive jewelry she's just going to trade in, take the cash and replace with fakes.<eos> Well, that's a pretty specific assumption.<eos> He got her these diamond stud earrings. She swapped them with cubic zirconia.
Come with me.<eos> 147 pins.<eos> Each one represents a child injured by walter bishop.<eos> Injured how?<eos> Walter's invented a great many things.<eos> Wondrous things. That much is true.<eos> But what he didn't tell you is where his ideas come from.<eos> Elephants, rainbows, licorice sticks...<eos> They come from the dreams of children.<eos> He steals children's dreams And he replaces them with nightmares.
- Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> - So what do you think?<eos> An aunt?<eos> - I really...<eos> You know, every other kid I knew dreamed that their parents would come and claim them, and then they'd turn out to be rock stars.<eos> But I... I just dreamed that...<eos> You know, never mind.<eos> - Too late to stop now.<eos> - I dreamed that my mother would roll up in a big bus, and she would rescue every kid in every orphanage in the world and bring them home.
I don't know what is worse, the ugliness of them or the smell of them.<eos> These are a working man's feet.<eos> These are toes to be proud of.<eos> Toes that deserve tender respect.<eos> What they deserve is a room of their own where I don't have to look at them.<eos> A house of their own!<eos> Woman, you do not appreciate earthy beauty when it is under your eyes.<eos> If you so much as hug me looking like something that has crawled out of a ditch, I will have you sleep in the pigsty.<eos> Robert, whatever happened to...romance... and mystery?<eos> Give us those socks, and I'll darn them.
Well, Doug isn't even sure if she was wearing it.<eos> She always wore it.<eos> Shit, Leo. Whiskey? it's 5:00 A.M.<eos> You're talking about your angel, washing machines, And demonic forces. What do you expect?<eos> What else you want to know?<eos> Didn't you tell me about some secret service documents, Said two guys got out of the truck?<eos> Yeah, an Agent wrote it immediately after the bombing, Right after viewing the security video tapes, Which don't exist.<eos> He said a Ryder truck pulled up, Parked, suspects exited the truck. Yeah.<eos> And there were other witnesses who said there were two men.<eos> The FBI calls them "trauma victims" So their accounts aren't reliable, easy to blow off.
That's a big bloodstain.<eos> It's consistent with blunt-force trauma.<eos> All right, this is where Alexis Wilkes was killed.<eos> Killed in her own room and thrown out with the laundry.<eos> You know, I'm not so sure she was in this room alone. She might have been sharing.<eos> Check this out. This picture was taken here. It's with our other two victims.<eos> That guy did a header off the hotel roof last night.<eos> They were friends.<eos> Looks like they all went to the same college, too.<eos> We need to find out who these kids are and who would want them dead.
I'm telling you.<eos> A lot!<eos> JJ, this is Liam, Albert's dad.<eos> He baby-sits for me sometimes... if he's good.<eos> Right, Liam?<eos> Yeah, right. Yeah, right. I'm ready for our date, JJ.<eos> Change the baby, Liam. Would you mind?<eos> Coming?<eos> I see you touch my kid again, I'm gonna rip your lungs out.<eos> Touch her... and I'll set them on fire and shove them up your arse.
You got what you wanted.<eos> The Nygaax is free.<eos> Now let Kahlan and Cara go.<eos> I'm sorry, Seeker, your friends are too powerful.<eos> If I release them, they'll only help you protect those cowards.<eos> More bloodshed won't bring your sons back.<eos> They were good boys.<eos> So brave.<eos> They knew Dunshire didn't stand a chance against the D'Haran army.<eos> When their tiles were drawn, I begged them to run away.
Way the Christ out in the Everglades burying some Dominican guy's rooster.<eos> Fun.<eos> Oh, you mean literally.<eos> Yes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I mean, look at my clothes.<eos> And what the hell are you wearing, Woodhouse?<eos> I...<eos> We bought those for him.<eos> If you throw them off the roof I'll fly to New York and fling acid in your face.
The adults need to have a little conversation.<eos> Check you later.<eos> Okay... did that... holy crap.<eos> Yeah, tell me about it.<eos> By the way, next time I say "let's keep driving,"<eos> let's keep driving.<eos> Okay, yeah, next time.<eos> Uh, all right, so, what's our next move?<eos> I-I... I don't know.<eos> We grab those poor saps out of the freezer, I guess... bust them out.
Hey, we're coming to get you.<eos> If I don't make it... can you tell my mother I love her, please?<eos> You're gonna tell her yourself.<eos> I think that girl got shot... Ella, the hostess.<eos> I think she was in on it.<eos> All right, that's enough.<eos> All right, just bring the money, Frank.<eos> Tommy, give me your piece.<eos> We go in there, they put their hands in the air and give up, my guys are still gonna execute them.<eos> You tell them I'll back them all the way.
- What about fingerprints at his place?<eos> - It's all so messy.<eos> But his son's fingerprints are everywhere.<eos> In Conti's opinion it's a premeditated double murder.<eos> I need some deeper analysis on burnt down remains.<eos> - Here he is!<eos> - Why did you do it?<eos> Tell us something.<eos> - Why did you do it?<eos> - David, why did you kill them?
- Soon.<eos> - People are scared.<eos> - We'll do whatever we can.<eos> - We can't throw the first person we find in jail.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - The thieves will have left Italy.<eos> - They're still in the city.<eos> There's no problem.<eos> The job is yours, this is your photo.<eos> We're gonna catch them, you'll see.

Grimes was telling the truth.<eos> Medina was trying to sell the mummy. This is getting good.<eos> This collector, where is he from?<eos> I've done testing for him before-- uh, uh, hominid skulls, a mammoth tusk.<eos> He asked me to carbon date them, wanted me to make sure it was real.<eos> And was it?<eos> It's complicated. We'll try and keep up.<eos> As soon as an organism dies, it stops taking in new carbon.<eos> Specifically, we focus on carbon 14, which starts to decay in the body as soon as it dies, and by examining the rate of decay, we can actually date the age of the dead organism with incredible accuracy.<eos> When I tested the mummy, I took samples from the sarcophagus the cloth the mummy was wrapped in and a small piece of bone, and then I ran them through a mass spectrometer and...
Why did you and Boyd blow up that meth lab?<eos> Me?<eos> ! That was before I got down here.<eos> Ain't you paying attention?<eos> Well, you must have heard something.<eos> You know he killed a man sleeping in the back of that place, and now it seems he's killed two other men, as well.<eos> Oh, I know what you're thinking.<eos> Only two minutes to the camp.<eos> Can't wait to show off your shiny new badge.<eos> He never killed them.

How's your brother?<eos> Well, down to business, then.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> - It's about what I can do for you.<eos> - Really?<eos> Me and Sam dropped two of your jockeys.<eos> I think you know that.<eos> Yes, I got the memo.<eos> Well, we kept their secret-power rings, which is why I'm here.<eos> I heard some folks saying that you wanted them back. - And you were willing to pay.

My lord, for as long as it pleases, make it yours as well.<eos> I'm just back from the hunt...<eos> Each battle produces its conversions.<eos> Our defeats create new Huguenots, and vice versa, with the apostates... Who return to heresy with Coligny's first victory.<eos> I see nothing amusing in these reversals.<eos> And you, Monsieur...<eos> What of your experience with the heretics?<eos> My friend Chabannes...<eos> Let him speak, cousin.<eos> The heretics, as you call them, show as much grandeur and cruelty as the Catholics.
Yeah, and I don't need Denise to have fun.<eos> I got friends like you for that.<eos> I'm gonna pee and walk.<eos> You gotta pee?<eos> I'll try it.<eos> Hey, poop stains, we just had 53 beers.<eos> - How does that sound?<eos> - Bam! Sounds like a lie!<eos> Then how come I got 53 bottle caps in my pocket?<eos> You probably picked them up off the ground.
- Yeah, 051.<eos> - I'll text you tonight.<eos> Hey, Craig, didn't think I'd see you here.<eos> This is my friend Ricky.<eos> He's a basketball player.<eos> Maybe you've heard of him.<eos> Nope, I haven't.<eos> Well, you will, because he's the next big thing.<eos> You left your trophies in the apartment.<eos> Do you want them or should I melt them down?
The flag or the flag pin or the pledge or 'It's Morning in America.'<eos> "Bill Clinton got a blowjob in the Oval Office!"<eos> "And the Dixie Chicks insulted President Bush on foreign soil!"<eos> And when that happens, it hurts the feelings of our troops and then Tinkerbell's light goes out and she dies.<eos> Yes, the love of our troops.<eos> The ultimate in fake patriotism.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> The troops...<eos> We pay them like shit.<eos> We fuck them and trick them on deployments.

No, mom.<eos> She just really stinks.<eos> Aiden, that is really not a nice thing to say!<eos> How we doing here?<eos> Fine, but you can talk to your son about his manners. Yeah.<eos> Let me show you What we were thinking about for Aiden's dinner.<eos> Ok.<eos> Can I be excused?<eos> I thought fish sticks were your favorite.<eos> Only when my mom makes them.
So, what do you need me for?<eos> Well, you know we got a new division commander, Caulfield, right?<eos> Mm-hmm. He comes down to the hospital, reads them the riot act about how they could have made the kid's injuries worse.<eos> Now he's threatening to bring charges against them... reckless endangerment.<eos> I want you to talk to these guys.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> So, the brass is trying to deflect, keep the department's nose clean?<eos> Yeah, no kidding. And you know how short-staffed we are at Bridge Division.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, Caulfield sends them back here to secure the apartment as a crime scene.
No, use chromic.<eos> Don't get lazy on me.<eos> Yep, he's fine.<eos> Right.<eos> Chromic instead, boki.<eos> You paged?<eos> Oh, my god. Are you doing an ex vivo lung repair?<eos> My daredevil turned out to be a match.<eos> You stole his lungs?<eos> No, I did not steal them.

Are you doing an ex vivo lung repair?<eos> My daredevil turned out to be a match.<eos> You stole his lungs?<eos> No, I did not steal them.<eos> The transplant team rejected them And were gonna send them to medical waste, So I just redirected them to medical research.
You know what?<eos> Before you go on telling me how I can't handle the truth,<eos> I don't care what backroom deal you made! What happened in that E.R. Today will never happen again!<eos> And you set me up!<eos> I'm in an impossible situation.<eos> Oh, really, morrissey?<eos> Did she threaten you with a lawsuit?<eos> She's been here almost 20 years.<eos> She knows where the bodies are buried!<eos> That's because she buried them!
Keep your mouth shut.<eos> Put your gun down...<eos> Hands in the air!<eos> Hands in the air!<eos> Turn around!<eos> Get down! Get down!<eos> We're police.<eos> Billy pulls in, she didn't know these two guys were cops.<eos> Looked like weight lifters to me.<eos> Yeah. So she takes them down.
What about the guy that got hit?<eos> Anything there?<eos> I put a call in to the hospitals.<eos> No gunshot wounds have come in yet, but could be he's dead already or holed up somewhere.<eos> You mind if I talk to these two guys?<eos> I want to get them ready for the shooting team.<eos> Mm. I love it when you ask me first.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'll send them over.
I didn't think Deke was running girls no more.<eos> Yeah, no.<eos> He's just a good customer.<eos> Deke and Bosun on bikes?<eos> Bosun's got a bike.<eos> Deke's got a pickup.<eos> Deke's got a pickup, Tommy.<eos> These cops... What are they into?<eos> Juice.<eos> Yeah. Figured when I saw them.
They were paying me to direct tourists away and let 'em know if there were any local cops or feds snooping around.<eos> But that's it.<eos> Okay, these people who got killed--I never even saw them.<eos> I need the names of the people who paid you.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Look, these aren't hippies growing weed in the forest, okay?<eos> These are serious, serious men.<eos> If they learn that I gave up their names, they'll kill me.<eos> Look, they know you've been arrested.<eos> They think you're giving them up right now.

I got it.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> We don't administer medication that falls on the floor.<eos> Camille, what happened?<eos> Oh, you know this girl?<eos> I do.<eos> She's my daughter.<eos> A patient on seven left his glasses.<eos> They asked me to bring them up.<eos> Actually, I got them over here.
That's no problem.<eos> Mom can make garbage taste great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, I mean it.<eos> And it means the world to me.<eos> Well, don't worry, boy.<eos> I know a wholesome way to take your mind off girls.<eos> This is awesome!<eos> If only real life was in 3-d.<eos> and the glasses smell Like the last guy who wore them had pizza.
- She can't. - You need loads of qualifications.<eos> - Yeah, true. Plus it's scary. Everyone I know lives round here.<eos> Craig got offered a job in London, better money, didn't take it.<eos> What's wrong with staying here?<eos> I can't see the point of London.<eos> Well, perhaps that's you, then.<eos> You'll just have to stay here, secure, and a little bit miserable, until the day you drop.<eos> Better than trying and failing, eh?<eos> - You think I'd fail?<eos> - Everybody's got dreams, Sophie. Very few are going to achieve them, so why pretend?
Hi.<eos> - Please. Will you help me?<eos> - What's the matter, my love?<eos> Help you?<eos> Argh! I am never, never doing that ever, ever again...<eos> Amy!<eos> That's Amy Pond!<eos> Oh, of course, you can understand us now, hurrah...<eos> Got those plans yet?<eos> - Still searching for them.
Eli's checking it.<eos> But we still have to talk to them.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> All-nighter?<eos> No, just a few more hours.<eos> I found condoms in your bedside table.<eos> I was looking for your letter opener.<eos> I thought maybe they belonged to Zach.<eos> You know, you found them in his room.

You'd have a sensible conversation with him about responsibility.
My first cousin and his son are almost certainly dead.<eos> - We'll all be in mourning.<eos> - No, I mean with the other thing.<eos> After all, it wasn't official.<eos> If you're saying you do not wish to mourn Patrick as a fiance, that is up to you.<eos> Well, no one knew about it outside the family.<eos> I repeat, it is up to you.<eos> Well, that's a relief.<eos> There's some cedar-lined cupboards in the attic for things that aren't often worn, travelling clothes and such.<eos> Mr Watson used them to rotate the summer and winter stuff.
I don't understand.<eos> I thought all of you had found a new life here on Earth.<eos> We were wrong to follow you, Kal-El.<eos> When we did what you asked and tried to assimilate with the humans, we were left behind.<eos> We're gathered here waiting for Zod's return to ask his forgiveness.<eos> I'm sorry, Faora. I never meant to divide our people, but you cannot realign with Zod.<eos> You've never trusted him, Kal-El.<eos> All Zod wanted was to give us power so we could protect ourselves.<eos> Zod already has powers.<eos> He's had them for weeks.
I can't believe it. - Are you okay?<eos> The miracle of life growing inside of you.<eos> I'm in luck! Two smackdowns for the price of none.<eos> - What the hell are you doing?<eos> - Don't screw up Nate and Serena.<eos> - Nothing happened.<eos> - So said Serena, but I'm thinking she left a little something out.<eos> All right.<eos> Blair...<eos> Say life is giving you signs, and you're ignoring them because you're afraid of the thing they're signaling you to do.
"Oh!" You know?<eos> Yeah. Business is big. It's, uh... (INHALES)<eos> It's very complicated. Like, right now, I've got this puzzle.<eos> Looks to me like two in every two dozen or so robots isn't making it to the military.<eos> We were skimming some for the STO on Gemenon, but not that many.<eos> Right, right, I noticed that, too.<eos> But I'm told that the, um, robot skeleton requires levels of performance that are right at the edge of the specs that the suppliers can meet, so about one in 25 don't pass our standards.<eos> Hmm. Okay.<eos> I didn't notice any records of faulty skeletons being returned.<eos> No, we sell them to the, um, reclamation company, to be melted down.
In Graystone's world, people do just about anything for money.<eos> You live very rustically, don't you?<eos> Well, I suppose if you like it that way...<eos> This girl, Lacy Rand, she was sent to us by Clarice Willow. Said girl exerts unexplained control over war machines we bought on the black market.<eos> This is troubling.<eos> Only if you try to explain it.<eos> I'm sorry, Mother, I don't understand.<eos> Secrets have answers.<eos> Now mysteries, they don't have answers.<eos> That's why I love them.
I'm going to faint.<eos> All right, drink this. It'll relax you.<eos> - Alcohol?<eos> I don't drink alcohol.<eos> - Fine, faint.<eos> I don't feel different.<eos> This alcohol's defective.<eos> Here. See if this one works.<eos> First of all, the projects were totally different.<eos> I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow. But my mother didn't hear me.
That's messed up.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> That's cool you gave him the job - as a favor.<eos> - Yeah, well, it was the least I could do.<eos> Wendell had a big part in helping me secure my military contract.<eos> He wanted to keep the jobs in California.<eos> I was the lowest bid in the state.<eos> You see the humvees.<eos> I inspect and repair the vehicles coming back to U.S. bases from Iraq and Afghanistan.<eos> They take some serious abuse in the desert over there, so we get them back in shape for service here.
Well, why attack you then?<eos> I don't know, to show that he could?<eos> This is you, Tom.<eos> You get an idea in your head and everyone else is stupid.<eos> I want focused, not fixated.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> DI Thorne would like a role in your investigation.<eos> How do you feel about that?<eos> Well, I can use all the help I can get.<eos> Alright, you can stay on, but you're taking orders not giving them.
No, I don't have an eating disorder.<eos> This is what denial looks like.<eos> I really don't.<eos> Joey does.<eos> This is a fake intervention for him.<eos> We were afraid he'd be full of shame, so we pretended it was for me.<eos> Wait, Joey, I'm sorry, but I didn't know what else to do when you lied about eating those cupcakes.<eos> I didn't lie.<eos> Check my food log.<eos> If I'd eaten them, I would have made a notation in the bad carbs column.
Yeah, yeah, I know, you're a scientist, so that whole intuition thing is just a load of crap, right?<eos> I have an intuition about you.<eos> Really?<eos> It tells me that you could use some company.<eos> Oh, I could use some company, really?<eos> Mm-hmm. I make you laugh.<eos> You make me laugh.<eos> You're going to make me laugh?<eos> Do you think these diamond earrings are real?<eos> I don't know. I could tell that they were real the minute my ex gave them to me.
I'm gonna do this.<eos> No, you are not, Lois.<eos> I'm sorry, but I forbid it.<eos> Oh, and I'm supposed to blindly go along with everything you decide for the both of us?<eos> Yes, Lois, that's how we co-exist.<eos> Just like I co-exist with the tiny race of people who live in our carpet.<eos> Dad, what's that?<eos> I think I hear music.<eos> Oh, that's the little people, Chris.<eos> They're playing music so that I will bless them with food.
- So there isn't any kind of preventative thing?<eos> - Please let her finish!<eos> - It's OK.<eos> I was done.<eos> Are you ready to see him?<eos> Somebody paged me here.<eos> Condoms.<eos> I'm building cartilage from Jell-O,<eos> - and you paged me for... - Condoms.<eos> - They have them in the clinic!
Heh-heh. Maybe we don't need to talk.<eos> I'm so excited for everybody to meet my sons.<eos> Hope they're not twins.<eos> Twins freak me out. They always know what the other one is...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thinking?<eos> And finishing each other's...<eos> Pie. Exactly.<eos> It's creepy. It's nice spending time with them.<eos> I don't get to see them that much since I started school.
And I might again.<eos> You are correct.<eos> It is CaPOLCA's responsibility to care for your welfare.<eos> You may come to our meeting.<eos> Laura, at least join us at our first gathering, to hear the case. Please. Since you enjoyed our ghost story so much,<eos> I decided we might make some puppets to present our story at the school bazaar.<eos> What an amusing notion, Emma.<eos> I am sure we would like to do just that, in addition to making the pin-a-sight which I had planned for the bazaar.<eos> It has long been the tradition of our school that each generation makes a pin-a-sight.<eos> We shall pick some flowers, children, and press them and then present them inside of a magical box.
Knatasha knightblade<eos> Put two kids through the university of Wisconsin.<eos> Do you have an e-mail list?<eos> No.<eos> You should get an e-mail list.<eos> You know, that way, You have direct access to your revenue stream.<eos> I made things easier for myself.<eos> I started an online wish list. It's kind of like a bridal registry.<eos> Let's say you want a dishwasher.<eos> So, you go on there, And you help them get off online. They do what they do,
yeah!<eos> (LAUGHS) i'm throwing rocks tonig.<eos> markt, mommy.<eos> nice job.<eos> you want to play?<eos> i think i'll play after.<eos> i want to talk first.<eos> okay.<eos> ah, charliebear... so, uh, do you remember when tim tim talked to squirrlio about heroes?<eos> when finnegan the supershark trapped them in the snow globe of snow doom?
And we have no powder to give them.<eos> What about their future?<eos> Or the others, way beyond our lands?<eos> With the yellow powder,<eos> We could come out of hiding And join forces against the mutants.<eos> This could be our last chance.<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Bring them.<eos> Sir...<eos> We do not recognize them,
Then i will make you as much as you need.<eos> If i fail you, you can kill me.<eos> You're dying already.<eos> You'll say anything.<eos> First, prove what you say, and i'll give you the powder.<eos> We don't have enough time.<eos> Well, then, you'd better be quick.<eos> What yellow powder remains Is for my children's children.<eos> Outsiders can stay on the island.<eos> We'll protect them from the mutants,
- You got two seconds to stand down.<eos> - Or? - I'm gonna pepper-spray you.<eos> - Pepper-spray me.<eos> That is just perfect.<eos> Pepper-spray the man who's expressing his opinion under the First Amendment!<eos> Lastly a little something from down El Paso way.<eos> Border Patrol came across multiple homicides just this side of the border.<eos> Truck turns out to be a chicken run out of Juarez into Laredo.<eos> Border Patrol's been playing hide-and-seek with these polleros for two years.<eos> But this time, soon as they made it across, someone hit them. Hit them hard.
You understand me?<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> I said, down. On your knees.<eos> Down!<eos> Damn it, get down.<eos> On your knees.<eos> On your knees or I'll fire!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I found the papers.<eos> Right where you left them, in the crib.
In the little village where l was born, life moved at a slower pace yet felt all the richer for it.<eos> There, my two uncles were known far and wide for their delicious cooking.<eos> They seasoned their zesty chicken using only the freshest herbs and spices.<eos> People called them Los Pollos Hermanos "The Chicken Brothers."
You need to decide what kind of company you want to be.<eos> Comfortable and dead, or risky and possibly rich.<eos> All I know is we don't want that.<eos> Well, gentlemen, you were wondering what a creative agency looks like, there you have it.<eos> Hope you enjoyed looking in the window.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Control yourself.<eos> Cool off.<eos> And hopefully Campbell can talk them into hearing a few more ideas in a week or so.
Did you enjoy the fuhrer's birthday?<eos> May he live for 1,000 years.<eos> My father used to say this is the greatest job in the world except for one thing, the clients.<eos> Good morning.<eos> -Did you make it home last night?<eos> -I did. I did.<eos> Come inside.<eos> -What's all this?<eos> -For your children.<eos> I bought them the other day, but I finally got them wrapped.
Could you bring it in, please?<eos> It says "don" on it.<eos> Give it to him.<eos> "help me, Honda, help help me, Honda.<eos> Love, Teddy Chaouh."<eos> - So there is no gift.<eos> - That's how they work.<eos> They want us to go in there, bow down and beg them to chop our heads off Because we disgraced ourselves.<eos> How could you admire these animals?<eos> Would you shut up? They're businessmen And you insulted them to their face.
No.<eos> This is just a stop sign.<eos> I walk into a lot of offices And it's helped me avoid a lot of distracting conversations.<eos> But you told me.<eos> Do you have children?<eos> I do.<eos> Two boys and a girl...<eos> One and a half, seven and 10.<eos> I'm sure it must be hard to be apart.<eos> I don't see them enough.
The fur guy.<eos> -What are you doing here?<eos> -I have a meeting in the building.<eos> I saw you standing here and I thought I'd say hello.<eos> Really?<eos> Name one other company in this building.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's just...<eos> I've left some messages for you.<eos> And I've ignored them. That's my message for you.
And it was at this point you drove to the home of Jesse Pinkman?<eos> I think we're done here.<eos> Agent Schrader needs to get home get some rest.<eos> That's fine.<eos> But just to confirm, you're taking the Fifth here?<eos> Yeah, that's correct.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well we just wanna give you all a heads up.<eos> Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges in this matter.<eos> He's given a detailed version of events as he sees them.
Our cells need to separate on an atomic level.<eos> Problem is, when they come back together they don't come back together with the same cohesion.<eos> Somehow Bell managed to cross back and forth although precisely how we can find no record.<eos> But I suspect that whatever methodology he crossed so many times that he has become like this coffee cup.<eos> Molecularly unstable.<eos> As many atoms in each of us as there are stars in the sky.<eos> That's why Belly never came back, isn't it?<eos> He was scared that the same thing would happen to him.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've sent him communications but if he got them, he hasn't been able to communicate to me.
- Everything points to the heart.<eos> All right, Mr Drake, you're in safe hands now.<eos> What will happen to his wife?<eos> She may try to keep the farm on.<eos> Grantham is not a harsh landlord, but her children are young.<eos> What can I do to help?<eos> If I'm to live in this village, I must have an occupation.<eos> Please. Let me be useful.<eos> He chooses his clothes himself.<eos> He puts them out at night and hangs the ones he's worn.
I'd like that very much. Excellent.<eos> Well, it's quite a hike, so I'll pick you up around 6:00.<eos> Lady Jervas has asked us for a bite to eat afterwards. - Lfthat's all right with your mother?<eos> - By all means.<eos> Well, I must run.<eos> I hope I haven't spoiled your dinner.<eos> We may have to hire a nurse, after all.<eos> Oh, for heaven's sake, hold it steady if you don't want to start again from the beginning.<eos> Do these biscuits go up?<eos> - No, I put them out for the fairies. - Oh.
Buddy! Think the problem is, you're not jumping from high enough.<eos> You should get on top of the garage.<eos> Alex, stop trying to kill your brother.<eos> Listen, guys, I need your help.<eos> We've gotta find your dad one of those iPad thingies.<eos> So, Haley, text everyone you know.<eos> Alex? Facebook, chat, tweet, buzz, bling, I don't know! Just do what you have to do.<eos> [Gas Hissing] Luke?<eos> Sweetie, that means stay out of everyone's way and stop inhaling the balloons.<eos> [Squeaky Voice] I'm not inhaling them.
Hey man.<eos> - What?<eos> - You need to be careful.<eos> Huh? See these power lines?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They got transponders in them.<eos> You know what a transponder is?<eos> I do.<eos> Well, they put them in back when it was built in the '50s for the commies.<eos> They never had to use them though.
- But with the Jedis' help...<eos> - Excuse me, but help you with what?<eos> Pirates.<eos> Simply stated, if we don't give the pirates a portion of our crop, they will destroy our homes with us in them.<eos> Hmm, I see your dilemma.<eos> Sillim farming is a meager trade.<eos> Without our herbs to sell, we will have no money for food, fuel or equipment.<eos> And yet you can afford to pay mercenaries?<eos> These bounty hunters drive a far more reasonable bargain than the pirates.<eos> - Why not just fight them yourselves?
Well, the ones who stuck around, anyway.<eos> Very well, Anakin.<eos> Turn on the fence.<eos> Battle positions, everyone!<eos> Embo!<eos> Embo, can you hear me?<eos> You'll be all right. We'll get you inside.<eos> Everyone, fall back to the barn!<eos> That tank is going to tear the villagers apart.<eos> Get him inside. We'll hold them off as long as we can.
They had been biding their time, waiting, just waiting for the day they sensed Mogolo had reached the end of his reign.<eos> And that day had come.<eos> Old Mogolo was quickly defeated.<eos> He would be forced to wander the land alone.<eos> How could he just leave his family?<eos> Was he a coward?<eos> No, Mogolo was no coward!<eos> He might have tried to take on a single challenger, but he was no match for the combined forces of the mighty Mhahlwa.<eos> The young males fled for their lives.<eos> The Mhahlwa would kill them if they offered up any resistance.
Yes, sir.<eos> This rifle needs a good clean.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And oil it properly.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We'll get him tomorrow.<eos> That, I guarantee.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Tomorrow I kill a white lion.<eos> Like two massive forces of nature, the lions were on a collision course, each step bringing them closer to what would surely be a fight to the death.
How'd you know?<eos> Alda Hertzog.<eos> She--she told me it was a very important piece of information.<eos> None of these buildings have numbers on 'em!<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> What?<eos> Rooftops.<eos> Mark, where are you?<eos> I'm three buildings up from the South end of the complex.<eos> Okay, they numbered them even/odd.
This is getting very big, very complicated.<eos> - Is there a ledger?<eos> - Yes. There's nothing online, nothing on computer.<eos> Just this little book.<eos> Yeah, that's, uh... That's too bad.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Because now we gotta go in and bust A bunch of dirty white guys Because we are gonna make a federal case out of this...<eos> Since 1970, the federal Witness Protection program Has relocated thousands of witnesses-- Some criminal, some not--<eos> Every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, Distinguishing them from the rest Of the general population.

The Captain has feelings, you know?<eos> All right, Jack, there has been another sighting of this creature and now supposedly<eos> CNE is running footage of it.<eos> Really.<eos> Wow.<eos> How gullible do you think I am?<eos> Look, this isn't a joke.<eos> I swear.<eos> Just, please, warn the audience.<eos> Okay, I'll warn them.
Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I didn't bring any jammies, though.<eos> You don't need any.<eos> Hey.<eos> Mom, thank you so much for this computer. I cannot tell you how it's helping me.<eos> I'm sorry about last night.<eos> Mom, please, don't worry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> We've had money problems before, and we'll have them again.
My apologies. You know, the old memory ain't what it used to be.<eos> That and everything else in your life.<eos> Yeah. From this point forward, I am your personal We-never-sleep clanging iron door.<eos> You do what I say when and how I say it,<eos> The door stays open. You don't, I'll slam it on your nuts till you're begging for prison.<eos> Wow.<eos> Never had a groupie before. You're a dream come true.<eos> Shut up and buckle.<eos> Since 1970, the federal Witness Protection program Has relocated thousands of witnesses, Some criminal, some not,<eos> To neighborhoods all across the country. Every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, Distinguishing them from the rest

You and Tom tried that.<eos> Evidently, I'm a man of steel.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Hi, Madison.<eos> See you later, Jack.<eos> That's not right.<eos> It's John's first birthday.<eos> It's not really for him. It's for their family, so they just invited their families.<eos> We have a gift for him. Yeah. So do I.<eos> We'll give the gifts to Amy, and then she can give them to him. No. No.
Anything yet?<eos> No sign of Animal Rescue yet.<eos> Uh, it's Fish and Wildlife.<eos> Penguins are birds.<eos> Explain to me why I'm doing this again.<eos> Do you think I have a special affinity to penguins because I'm from the Southern Hemisphere?<eos> No, unlike everyone else that works here, you know how to play it cool.<eos> Roger that.<eos> Oh. Okay, okay.<eos> I've got eyes on them.
Listen, I don't know what to tell you. I guess they thought that you'd think it was sweet, you know? Because penguins mate for life.<eos> "Mate for life"?<eos> Please.<eos> You want to know what "mates for life" don't do?<eos> Cancel a trip to meet the girl mate's parents for the first time so that the boy mate can play a gig for seven people.<eos> Does that sound like mate-for-life material?<eos> Well, they did get hurt pretty bad. Alex is getting his pelvis X- rayed right now.<eos> Good.<eos> You know, people aren't even supposed to touch penguins.<eos> Because once they get their people scent on them, the other penguins will never let them back into the rookery.
Well, you name me one person who can count the things wrong with them on one hand.<eos> You.<eos> Okay, well, besides me.<eos> Well, I've got to go.<eos> You got a hot date?<eos> Actually, yeah.<eos> I mean, it remains to be seen how hot it's going to be but, I should probably change my shirt. Yeah.<eos> Have fun.<eos> Did you know penguins mate for life? Are you drunk?<eos> Nothing can break them up.
Explain this to me.<eos> The unsub hunts along the u. S.-Mexico border.<eos> How big is that area?<eos> Over 5,000 square miles of desert.<eos> He could have gone undetected for years.<eos> So why announce himself?<eos> Something happened recently.<eos> What do we know about crime in terlingua?<eos> It's a stop-over town.<eos> Immigrants stay only 24 hours before moving on, but that also makes them narco-trafficking hubs.
Yeah, she's the only one.<eos> Hope you have a strong stomach.<eos> The chair was turned like that?<eos> This is exactly where you found him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Talk about staging.<eos> Talk about ego.<eos> There's also a couple boxes with journals Or composition books.<eos> They're filled with writing.<eos> We haven't been through them yet Other than to dust them for prints.
PHONE RINGS No, no, no, no...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes!<eos> Well... thank you, Lisa.<eos> That was very nice.<eos> Is there a Mr Gently here?<eos> Excuse me...<eos> It's through that door, Mister.<eos> Just get home, pet, go on.<eos> Somebody get hold of these kids and get them home.
Sorry.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Now, jealousy can provoke a crime of passion, But it can also arrive in stages, Like grief...<eos> Shock, denial...<eos> Rage.<eos> Followed by gunshots to the head.<eos> from a sniper rifle I still can't find.<eos> Oh, Joel. Which indicates planning on my part And that I'm hoping to get away with it.<eos> So, how did I react when you first told me about the affair?<eos> Was I cool, calm, and collected, or... Did I drag all your boxes into the driveway And put a hose to them?
Her legs?<eos> Turn around and just lean back on me.<eos> Oh, for heaven's sakes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Chief, there's something I need to tell you.<eos> Chief, before you -<eos> - I -- who removed the bodies?<eos> ! That's what I was trying to tell you.<eos> The Fire Department took them before we arrived.
Thank you.<eos> Chief, there's something I need to tell you.<eos> Chief, before you -<eos> - I -- who removed the bodies?<eos> ! That's what I was trying to tell you.<eos> The Fire Department took them before we arrived.<eos> L.A.F.D. won't let their people lie out dead -- same as us -- out of respect.<eos> That respect may have just cost us the investigation.<eos> Okay. The bodies are at Good Samaritan.<eos> Where do you want them?
Lieutenant Flynn...<eos> Good to see you looking so well.<eos> Oh. Spoke too soon.<eos> What happened?<eos> Some guy brought a knife to a gunfight.<eos> I gather you had the gun?<eos> I hope you know it's illegal to question me without my attorney present...<eos> Although I love that you guys are doing something illegal.<eos> Always nice to meet someone who understands their rights.<eos> Mm, well, once you've had them taken away, you appreciate them more.
I'd like to speak to you for a moment, please.<eos> Did you just say "hippies" and "maryjane"?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> How old are you?<eos> Six Chiefs and counting, which is how I know that if you deal drugs, you vastly increase your chances you'll end up dead.<eos> I'm low on sympathy here.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> Because as of now, you're the L.A.P.D. Liaison to the medical-marijuana community for the rest of this investigation.<eos> What?<eos> And I expect you to meet with the dispensary owners this evening and educate them about today's events.
I-- stop!<eos> Before you say anything, you should know that your friends are being very cooperative.<eos> There's three of you, and I got one deal to cut. Do you want it or not?<eos> The other guys are...<eos> Talking?<eos> At this very moment.<eos> And how I file against y'all with the D.A. depends on which one of you is the most truthful.<eos> Mr. Clark...<eos> How well do you trust your partners?<eos> Because unlike them, you were caught blue-handed, and Detective Sanchez and Lieutenant Flynn are interviewing them right now.
Joan, I...<eos> I-I want you to know I have always loved you.<eos> And regardless of what you might hear, we can get through this.<eos> I know we can.<eos> And I want you to know...<eos> I'm taking Skander home with me.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Thank God. Thank you, Joanie.<eos> And then I'm leaving with the children.<eos> And you will never see any of them again as long as you live.
You almost got yourself killed!<eos> Never, ever do that again.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Chief!<eos> All right.<eos> Okay?<eos> How is he?<eos> Better.<eos> Get this... When Ruben was hanging out with those other kids at the park, he thought he was doing undercover work, identifying illegals.<eos> Then his dad would rape them.
Well, I appreciate that it's against the law, Ms. Reid, but most killers don't care about that.<eos> Besides which, you can't just place any heart into any body.<eos> Donors have to be matched with recipients.<eos> You people.<eos> You never do anything but make things harder on us.<eos> Harder in what way?<eos> Let's start with a potentially great source for healthy organs - homicide victims.<eos> Well, a murder victim's organs might be used as evidence.<eos> And the guidelines under which we operate... guidelines aren't laws.<eos> The police aren't compelled to keep those organs. And patients die because you don't give them to us.
Okay, so I see two robbers here, but you say there are more?<eos> Well, Dear Jane usually has four inside and a getaway driver outside, for a total of five guys.<eos> Buzz, can you shift to the parking-lot footage?<eos> Sure.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, well, two run out - they're looking for their ride.<eos> Now, in their 20 or so jobs, they've always used a van as a getaway.<eos> So, where is the van?<eos> You seem to know an awful lot about these Dear Jane people.<eos> Why haven't we ever heard of them before?
I'm not a suspect!<eos> I completely apologize!<eos> You did steal my suspect.<eos> We're checking out all the Haywards' friends.<eos> They're both on a bowling team.<eos> No link to the robbers there.<eos> Wife's in the church choir.<eos> They ask to go home?<eos> No.<eos> We kept them comfortable overnight.
Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> For keeping our secret.<eos> Not saying anything to that girl's parents at the hospital.<eos> Well, it's all about family, right?<eos> I'm not sure my family has been the best thing for you.<eos> Is there a reason that you never talk about your parents?<eos> I didn't really know them.
Sir... the Winchesters are here.<eos> We should go.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> They have a track record with Horsemen.<eos> You mean my brothers.<eos> What they did to my brothers.<eos> No.<eos> The only reasonable thing to do here is to... take it out of their healthy young asses.<eos> We're under strict orders not to kill the vessels.<eos> Oh, if Satan wants them so bad, he can glue them back together!
You really don't.<eos> We never made a move, okay?<eos> We just wanted a story to tell our friends.<eos> You know, keep our reputation.<eos> Look, this won't be made Public record, will it?<eos> Hey, stell.<eos> I know the contoursi brothers may look the part, But there's no way they did this.<eos> I went over their camaro front and back, Found nothing linking to our vic.<eos> Anything more on the tread marks at the construction site?<eos> I compared them to the contoursi's tires.
Calcutta...<eos> that's quite long way.<eos> Just before Aaron's mother passed, She made him promise that we would bring him to New York.<eos> So can I ask you If your father's presence in your house Has always been this challenging?<eos> At first things may have been easier.<eos> He seemed functional at least.<eos> I mean, he was engaged with the children. He was affectionate with them And ate breakfast with them in the morning.<eos> They were crazy about him.<eos> They still are.<eos> I think he scares them now, Aaron.
- Hola, Jay. - Where are you?<eos> I have Manny in the carpool, and we're going to the dropout.<eos> Dropout...<eos> You mean that Eddie kid?<eos> Yeah, he's a moron.<eos> No, the dropout, where you drop the kids in the school.<eos> She means "drop-off."<eos> That's what I said.<eos> Listen. Did you ever do anything about costumes for Claire's thing tonight?<eos> I'm going to pick them up this afternoon.
- If there's anything we can do- - There isn't.<eos> I wish circumstances were different.<eos> Much of the time, I'd rather be here.<eos> We know you got a steaming pile on your plate.<eos> There's no need for apologies.<eos> We're your friends.<eos> Listen, Sam.<eos> We'll find another way. You really wanna help?<eos> Prison full of monsters.<eos> Can't just leave them, can't let them go.
Right, but it's a Shifter too.<eos> Still doesn't change the fact that we've gotta... We gotta look after this thing.<eos> But what are we gonna do with it?<eos> We can't drop it off at an orphanage. They might get upset when it turns Asian.<eos> - Samuel.<eos> Samuel. He'll know what to do.<eos> - You wanna bring it to hunters?<eos> - Not just hunters.<eos> They're our family.<eos> - We don't know them.
I need your help.<eos> That's rich, really.<eos> Sam, Dean, my "people skills" are "rusty."<eos> I have spent the last "year"... as a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent.<eos> But believe me, you do not want that weapon down here.<eos> Help me find it, or more people will die.<eos> All right, okay. Well, if the angels didn't pull the trigger, then that brings us back to motive.<eos> - What?<eos> - Back to the case.<eos> And now we got three dead cops. Only thing linking them is this.
Aaron.<eos> Aaron Birch.<eos> Okay, Aaron Birch, where did you get this?<eos> - You won't believe me.<eos> - Try me.<eos> It was an angel.<eos> An angel?<eos> Those liars, they killed my brother and nothing bad even happened to them.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> So I prayed to God every night he would punish them.
The organism operates like hair follicles.<eos> Anchors its root system to the bone.<eos> You know, it's actually kind of attractive up close.<eos> Yeah, for a mucous-excreting underwater insect.<eos> Well, let me scan the skull, and then I can build the facial reconstruction from it.<eos> Do you realize these guys could be harder to identify than a decomposed murder victim?<eos> How can you compare a murder victim to ocean snot that looks like something that Barbie wore to the prom?<eos> You compared 'em to a Chia Pet.<eos> Yeah, well, that's not the same thing.<eos> You're right, because if these guys are new, and I get to identify them, then I get to name an entire species.
You went on that cruise, looking for him, didn't you?<eos> What did he say?<eos> Threaten to tell your husband about the affair?<eos> I didn't kill Liam.<eos> And there's nothing you can do to prove different.<eos> We're almost wrapped up.<eos> Booth called.<eos> He thinks Claire Casper did it, but there's no evidence to tie her to the crime.<eos> No, I was actually... I was talking about the Amalia Rose.<eos> The remains have been identified, and they're moving them into the exhibit.
Let me call you back.<eos> Excuse us, sir.<eos> I'm Detective Ryan. This is Detective Esposito.<eos> Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?<eos> Ah! Top of the morning to you, constables.<eos> Lord Henry at your service.<eos> Uh, thanks.<eos> You mind telling us where you got those clothes?<eos> Oh, not at all, dear boy.<eos> I picked them up at the haberdashery across the park.
There's no record of Dr. Monroe ever visiting the prison, but the logs do show that another member of the hospital staff was making weekly visits to Bedford Hills prison facility.<eos> Anyone we know?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Nurse Greg, seriously?<eos> Seriously. For the past three years,<eos> Greg has been making weekly visits to an inmate named Amy Porter, who is doing 30 years to life for her role as a getaway driver in a failed robbery where a security guard was killed.<eos> So I did a little bit of digging, and apparently, Greg was her character witness at her trial.<eos> Amy is Greg's girlfriend. Mm-Hmm.<eos> Dr. Monroe was on to prescription fraud and a smuggling ring.<eos> She thought Greg was stealing meds from the hospital and smuggling them into Amy.
Not just birds. The red-tailed hawks.<eos> Len oversees the log in the Central Park boathouse where all the sightings are officially recorded, but he refused to acknowledge my sighting.<eos> So I told him if he didn't believe me, he should go out to the park and see for himself.<eos> They nest at dusk.<eos> Mr. Singer, were you in the park yesterday between 5:00 and 7:00 p. m?<eos> Usually I am, but yesterday I was in my office, working.<eos> And can any of your colleagues verify that?<eos> I'm sure they can. But about the hawks, and I want this on the official record. I would never exaggerate or fabricate a bird sighting.<eos> It's unthinkable!<eos> They're there and I saw them first.
Please. I've had relationships that didn't last this long.<eos> True.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We were talking about the hiking trip next Saturday.<eos> Oh, has Ashley got the all clear from his parents to come with us?<eos> They say they want to meet you first.<eos> Ah, they want to vet me to make sure if there's some kind of rock slide, that I won't leave their boy stranded on a mountainside, having to gnaw off his own arm to survive.<eos> So you'll do it?<eos> We'll have them over for dinner.
- Glad to help.<eos> - Jules told me that you love Halloween. And I'm having a costume party at my pub tomorrow night, so...<eos> God, help me, I love costumes.<eos> Hey, Robert, you remember when we went as Hall and Oates?<eos> I became Hall.<eos> Or was it Oates?<eos> I don't know, but I had a beautiful moustache.<eos> I don't know what to be for my costume.<eos> Last year I was Octomom, but carrying around all those baby dolls all night got super annoying.<eos> I just tossed them in a dumpster eventually. Which got caught on a grainy security camera. Long story short:
Morning.<eos> Wow. Okay. Hey there.<eos> Can I give you some constructive criticism?<eos> As long as you start with something nice.<eos> You are a great gal, really smart and funny...<eos> I can swim real fast.<eos> So fast.<eos> But your hugs are too intense.<eos> Now I love 'em... not really... but with people who you aren't sleeping with, you can't give them a "stab me with your pelvic bone" hug.<eos> But people love them.
# These streets will make you feel brand new #<eos> - # Brand new # - # Big lights will inspire you #<eos> # Let's hear it for New York #<eos> # New York, New York # # New York, New York #<eos> # Bah bah bah bah bah #<eos> # Bah bah bah. #<eos> Can I talk to you for a second? Sure, buddy.<eos> You look steamed.<eos> Those kids went out and really tried to show what Glee Club was all about.<eos> And how does the school repay them?
Coach, we've got a problem.<eos> Thanks, guys. Those go under the tree in the choir room.<eos> Plop it down there. Thank you.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> Six different people got Sue a Shake Weight.<eos> Becky, go into the glove box of my Le Car and bring me my tear gas.<eos> Then get me Gloria Allred.<eos> Merry Christmas, Sue.<eos> As you can see, we're repo'ing your gifts.<eos> Most can't be returned since you inexplicably opened all of them.

If he ain't hangin', we ain't bangin'!<eos> Everything good?<eos> Yeah, Christina needed some help in the E.R.<eos> An afghan couple didn't speak any English.<eos> Really?<eos> I saw "deer hunter" the other night. good film.<eos> Powerful.<eos> It's chilling, you know?<eos> It is amazing what those vets had to go through, and...<eos> Candy, I-I completely understand why... why they just... Why they withdraw from the people who care about them.
You could have been killed.<eos> Godfrey was undermining Metropolis' faith in its defenders.<eos> I couldn't just stand by and let that happen.<eos> Well, what you did was brave, but ...<eos> Between you and me, I was terrified.<eos> My worst fear is to be alone in the world without heroes.<eos> Thank God, Ubergirl- Powergirl?<eos> Megagirl? Was there to save me from the gallows.<eos> Your cousin needs a better handle.<eos> Well, just remember that heroes like her or the Blur-- Put them on too high a pedestal, they might let you down.
Some will use the law to destroy people.<eos> I'm a military man, Clark.<eos> I have to believe that when push comes to shove, America will do the right thing.<eos> Kind of like Lois did the right thing by you tonight.<eos> For years, I've been giving her boyfriends an impossible list of chores to do.<eos> Not to test them.<eos> To test Lois?<eos> Uh-huh. Those poor bastards, I put them through hell.<eos> Lois never said a thing.<eos> That's how I knew she didn't love them.
I'm sorry, but this leg's gonna have to go.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> It's almost over.<eos> Now to take care of the witnesses.<eos> Hey, I need those cookies for Santa.<eos> At least someone around here's got the Christmas spirit.<eos> Come midnight, I'll be sitting here with cold cookies, warm milk, and hot lead.<eos> For the last three years, I've asked that rosy-cheeked nog-hog for a dirt bike, and all he brought me was a zillion lame-o toys that I immediately broke and threw in this bag.<eos> But you wanted those toys.<eos> I wanted them till I got them.
Well, instead, I grew this tree.<eos> Don't dare bring that thing in here.<eos> What?<eos> You don't want a Christmas tree?<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Next you won't want a Christmas ham.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> I love meat and I always will.<eos> That is some sweet pig meat.<eos> But as for Christmas trees, I used to love them, until last year...
Don't want to make waves here.<eos> I just thought we were supposed to be helping new citizens assimilate, not treating them like criminals.<eos> No.<eos> I'm mock clapping. - As am I.<eos> - No, you aren't.<eos> You're going for that slow, building applause thing, Like all those '80s movies.<eos> There's virtually no difference in our claps.<eos> Stop clapping, both of you.<eos> You rubber-stamp immigrants into the workforce.<eos> Grimes sends them back where they came from.
Me too.<eos> Me three.<eos> Streets ahead.<eos> Man, you guys really love these stupid chicken fingers, huh?<eos> They're not stupid, they're the only good thing in the cafeteria.<eos> I haven't had one in weeks. They run out so fast.<eos> If God were edible, not that I'm Catholic, but if it was cool to eat God, he'd be a chicken finger.<eos> Well, I wouldn't know. I'm a vegetarian.<eos> Oh, shocker.<eos> Yeah. And if you guys knew how they treated the animals that you're eating, you'd eat them even faster just to put them out of their misery. And then you would throw up.
"What are you looking at?" Duh!<eos> "What are you looking at?" Duh.<eos> Duh! Ha, ha.<eos> School his ass, Mark.<eos> "School his ass, Mark." Duh.<eos> Why are Jeff and Britta making fun of those handicapped kids?<eos> They don't even realize how much they need us.<eos> Why are they doing this?<eos> I don't know if you've noticed, but Jeff and Britta have the two most fragile egos of the group.<eos> Losing to these kids will pretty much destroy them.
He's having dinner at the masons.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Ok.<eos> You're telling me that these mindless, hungry things Want our son?<eos> Yes.<eos> And they'll kill him?<eos> If that's what it takes, they'll kill him. Yes.<eos> But Carl said<eos> That Aiden is young enough That if we tell him that ghosts Never existed, right,<eos> That he just had them in his imagination, Then he literally won't see them?
We can't tell anyone, not even our co-workers.<eos> Got it. I'll show the utmost discretion as we get nasty in this glass tube.<eos> I think I'm coming down with circus-itis.<eos> I thought circus-itis only affected children.<eos> Children of all ages.<eos> Bender, old friend, what's on your face?<eos> Blood. You know, shaving of the face beard.<eos> Amy, are those gear imprints on your sweatpants?<eos> Uh, maybe.<eos> So what? Well, I only brought it up 'cause Bender's wearing them.
Sweet file-not-found- of-Puegot Sound.<eos> His record's been blanked.<eos> Aw, man.<eos> How am I gonna find some anonymous guy I don't know anything about?<eos> I recommend the men's room at the TWA terminal.<eos> Okay, just file it alphabetically... ♪ A-B-C-D... ♪<eos> Well, this requires a little extra thought.<eos> I'm a natural.<eos> The information we need will be here, in the physical files.<eos> Those bastards won't know what leafed through them.
No gun.<eos> Very brave, Chuck.<eos> So what's happening?<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> No, what are you doing here?<eos> What's your plan?<eos> I'm sorry. Are you asking me to make the classic villain mistake of explaining my dastardly plot to you?<eos> You know what?<eos> I'd love to.<eos> I confess we had no idea who the elders were or how to I.D. them, so we let you do that for us when you warned them to leave the theater, so on behalf of the NSA, the CIA, and of course your local Buy More,
Interstate mortgage scam.<eos> Oh, interstate mortgages?<eos> That gets me seriously hot.<eos> Say it again, slower.<eos> Money going in and out is russian mob.<eos> Oh.<eos> Slight jolt of interest. So where's the whiny little fbi drone Who's come crawling to us for help?<eos> Hello, kitten.<eos> Since 1970, the federal witness protection program Has relocated thousands of witnesses, Some criminal, some not, to neighborhoods<eos> All across the country. Every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute Distinguishing them from the rest

Okay, so, you know about separating the colors, right?<eos> Well, clearly, I don't know how to separate colors.<eos> Oh, no, you...<eos> Why are you trying to segregate my laundry?<eos> Don't freak out.<eos> This book, this is good news, okay.<eos> We just have to figure out how we can amp up production on the summer line as fast as we can.<eos> All right?<eos> Look, this...<eos> Look, the samples for the summer line have practically sold out at every store we've sent them to. So, we can make up a lot of lost money here.
Show him the pictures.<eos> Ah, you mean the ring that Angelo used to bring his accounts current.<eos> That's the one.<eos> I don't have it anymore.<eos> Aw. You sold it?<eos> To a customer.<eos> She went crazy over it, had to have it.<eos> Can you give us her name?<eos> No. We do not release the names of our clients.<eos> Oh, would you release them to the police, because I think they'd be pretty interested in the operation you got going on here.
- Are you kidding me?<eos> - You heard me say clear my schedule.<eos> - I didn't know that meant me.<eos> - This is the NFL, baby.<eos> - And this is a Murano chandelier.<eos> I sell the TV rights and I will buy you Italy.<eos> What do you mean he sounded weird?<eos> - Not weird, just out of it.<eos> - He's on pain medication.<eos> Naw, he said he didn't take them.
Deeks.<eos> Deeks.<eos> We've got a problem.<eos> What kind of problem?<eos> Thompson's down, the hostages have escaped.<eos> Go find them.<eos> Make sure he's dead.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> I got jumped from behind.<eos> Someone's helping them.
Check out Heidi and Spencer over here.<eos> Oh, someone is not pleased with his choice of interior on the new 7 Series.<eos> - Got a runner.<eos> - Pickpocket?<eos> You've lost him.<eos> Try in the parking level.<eos> There.<eos> Frank, situation on B-level, two guys.<eos> On it.<eos> - I don't see them.
It's called a FISA warrant.<eos> We have to search your house.<eos> I promise we'll be respectful.<eos> Where is my husband?<eos> - You met Porter.<eos> - No. He tried to sell you artifacts stolen from Iraq.<eos> I did not meet this man.<eos> You did meet this man and you killed this man.<eos> And following strict Sharia law, you cut off the thief'ss hand as punishment.<eos> I did not do that. Then you took the artifacts and you sold them to raise money for Al-Jamal terrorist activities.
We're related.<eos> The DNA's got to be close.<eos> Nobody checked my brother's DNA.<eos> You and your brother went to camp together in the Angeles National Forest.<eos> Remember that?<eos> We think the latest girl could be buried there.<eos> I help you find her, you reopen my case.<eos> You have nothing to do with it, sure.<eos> When we were kids at that camp, there were feral cats that were all over the place.<eos> Andre-- well, Andre used to spend hours catching them and strangling them.

One that I regret.<eos> It doesn't matter anymore.<eos> Remember when we used to talk about getting away from it all?<eos> Just you and me on some remote island...<eos> Buddy hated the beach.<eos> Mason knows his stuff-- restricted airspace, no surveillance-- it's a virtual blind spot.<eos> Be sure to have some heavy-duty muscle backing him up.<eos> He'll want to verify the codes work.<eos> Which means the missiles will probably be someplace close.<eos> Nobody makes a move until we've confirmed he's got them.
The police found traces of paint from a black Escalade on your car, but isn't it possible that that could've come<eos> - from accidents prior to that night? - Nuh-uh.<eos> I'm sorry. Does "nuh-uh" mean no?<eos> Then say "no."<eos> No.<eos> It was a brand-new car, and I hadn't been in any previous accidents.<eos> This is a valet slip.<eos> It's actually your valet slip from the night in question.<eos> You see these marks on the back?<eos> The valet makes them so they don't get blamed - for previous damage.
Here we go.<eos> Who you calling?<eos> Lockhart/Gardner.<eos> Something on your mind?<eos> Let me see your phone.<eos> Why?<eos> I want to see who you're phoning.<eos> No. Why?<eos> Because I don't like to be questioned.<eos> Mr. Arkin said there were three other corrupt cops, so we immediately put them under surveillance.
"If not applicable, jump to question 12.<eos> "Question 12, are you now or have you ever been a member of the zombie party?"<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Oh, I must have grabbed the wrong application.<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> May I speak with you privately for a moment?<eos> It doesn't appear to have any ears, but sure.<eos> The truth is, I haven't put in a real day's work in about three years now.<eos> What did you do with the files before I arrived?<eos> Pretty much just threw them out this window.
In addition to mood stabilizers, It took a long time to find the right regimen For pain management since your accident.<eos> Look, with all due respect,<eos> "a," it wasn't an accident.<eos> I tried to kill myself on purpose.<eos> And "b," it's been 20 years.<eos> I think both the physical pain and the desire to kill myself Have passed by now.<eos> If that's true, why do you still come here?<eos> Why do you still lead your support group?<eos> I'm a ball player.<eos> In my day, even if they had steroids, I wouldn't have used them.
I got his prints right here.<eos> It's me, baby, open up!<eos> Ray's going back to prison.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> Robbed a bar.<eos> Mr. Dolworth.<eos> You said, uh, you'd have my papers ready this morning?<eos> I did. They're right there.<eos> So, we just sign these, and that's that? You may, I won't.<eos> But I prefer you shove them up your ass.
Hey, Britt.<eos> We should move him.<eos> Every night he supervised the tellers count up the day's take.<eos> And they'd put it in these bags and slide it down these chutes to the money guards in the tunnels.<eos> So, what, he got you access to the tunnels?<eos> And you beat up the guards and took the cash.<eos> No.<eos> That was the trick of the gig.<eos> There was no money in the bags.<eos> Bradley switched them, and then hid the 100 grand somewhere.
You wear success well.<eos> Acetaldehyde? What the hell is that?<eos> Industrial chemical.<eos> Cousin to formaldehyde.<eos> How did it get inside of him?<eos> Junkies dip their cigs in it for an extra buzz.<eos> I read it somewhere.<eos> Got your pal's personal effects down in the evidence locker.<eos> Still no leads on the daughter's whereabouts, so there's no next of kin.<eos> Mark thought you might want to take them until she shows up again. All right.
I paid you twice, and you're killing me now.<eos> What's wrong at the<eos> Montague?<eos> Who killed my friend?<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go see what's so important you can't leave the country without it.<eos> What is this?<eos> Some Montague documents I wasn't supposed to see.<eos> I kept them as a fail-safe to insure my safety and the safety of my family.
You were in a "permit only" zone.<eos> Where? Where does it say that?<eos> You can reclaim your vehicle at the city impound.<eos> Have a great day.<eos> Hank...<eos> Winston was in the truck.<eos> We are so boned.<eos> Sorry to disturb you, ma'am, especially around the dinner hour.<eos> Uh, yeah, I'm actually in the middle of making it.<eos> Well, I'm canvassing the neighborhood on behalf of a charity called "Tomes for Tots," where we collect used books from everyday folks such as yourself, and we donate them to local private schools so that white privileged children won't miss any opportunity or advantage.
His name is James.<eos> Not Jim, not Jimmy...<eos> Jamessss.<eos> I get it.<eos> She's sending her army into unknown territory.<eos> And I am flanking her...<eos> With these. Have you seen my eyes, Lemon?<eos> Yep. They're very blue.<eos> Like a mikonos sky.<eos> Mark Foley once called them "piercing."
Hey. I thought you had your family dinner thing tonight.<eos> I did, but...<eos> I had to apologize first. Look, I'm so sorry.<eos> I was acting like a jealous freak.<eos> - Look, it's okay.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> It's...<eos> - It's not. I trust you. I complete...<eos> I'm the one who needs to be apologizing.<eos> I mean, you had these plans, and then I ruined them. But...
You are sorry.<eos> Am I paying you people to stare at me?<eos> Go get me a glass of water.<eos> And do not make eye contact with me for the rest of the day.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, perfect.<eos> Jen, we have to talk.<eos> Ryan, you say that a lot.<eos> Look, I have the paternity papers,<eos> - and I'd like you to sign them.
Hi.<eos> Uh, do you have my test results?<eos> They're back, yes. And Dr. Wright<eos> Would like you to come in. What?<eos> Why?<eos> I'm not sure;<eos> I'm just relaying the message.<eos> M-my test okay, right?<eos> I'm sorry, I don't have the results.<eos> The doctor has them.
It's a first look at next season's new baby fashions.<eos> Every mother in Beverly hills with a black card will be at the beach club for the show.<eos> I'm going to make all sorts of BFFs.<eos> That sounds fun... Uh, meeting some other mothers.<eos> Well, I'm hoping to get some parenting tips.<eos> Sure.<eos> Cool.<eos> Like about diapers.<eos> What, like, uh, cloth or disposable?<eos> Is there any way around babies wearing them?
She is?<eos> Come on in.<eos> Hey.<eos> Olivia Dunham has been recovered.<eos> It appears that your treatments have taken effect after all.<eos> Your plan was sound.<eos> They just needed a bit more time than you assumed. No, it wasn't time.<eos> It was the adrenaline from her escape.<eos> The adrenaline triggered our Olivia's memory "b" lymphocytes.<eos> It carried them across the blood-brain barrier and successfully transferred the memories, which means for all intents and purposes... she is our Olivia now.
Walter, why don't we take a break and get something to eat?<eos> I don't have an appetite.<eos> Well, maybe just a change of scenery might clear your head, make you feel better.<eos> I suppose so.<eos> Walter, I thought you said you weren't hungry?<eos> I'm eating for comfort.<eos> To think what I put that poor woman through, and the most activity we saw occured in the shape-shifter's ass.<eos> It was his lower spine, Walter.<eos> Look, animal cookies. - You love these.<eos> - No. Belly loved them.

Okay.<eos> The paramedics took Max to the hospital. His mother is gonna meet him there.<eos> The super said that Wyatt Toomy had been living here for almost nine years.<eos> He kept to himself. Always paid his rent a week in advance.<eos> Hey, you guys should take a look at this.<eos> Have you figured out what he was doing?<eos> I won't know exactly until we get this back to the lab but my guess is Olivia was right.<eos> About what?<eos> Seems he was making some kind of age-regression serum.<eos> He was extracting hormones from the kids and giving them to himself.
[Blair] Chuck will soon realize that it doesn't matter if the dress is couture if the girl is off-the-rack, and then, as with all things that don't fit, you'll be sent back to where you came from.<eos> [Gossip Girl Open theme]<eos> [Gossip Girl] Overnight, our brooding billionaire's become a generous gentlemen.<eos> But what's responsible for this metamorphosis?<eos> Or should I say who?<eos> Has a French fairy touched Chuck with her magic wand?<eos> Or does simply being with an angel make you want to grow wings, too?<eos> Sorry, miss Blair.<eos> No papers today.<eos> I think maybe 8h steal them again.
Thanks for getting me in, but I should go before anybody sees us together.<eos> Of course. Have fun.<eos> That guy I told you about is here.<eos> Please distract me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't look over there, but my lit professor...<eos> Look at his pants.<eos> Look at 'em.<eos> I bet you 10 bucks they're held up with a rubber band.<eos> He wears them every single day.
Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Careful.<eos> It's right up here.<eos> Never thought I'd hope to find the two of them together. Careful.<eos> Watch the hippie.<eos> All right, where should I park? Right over there.<eos> Isn't it beautiful?<eos> This is where my daughter wanted to live.<eos> This place gives me the willies.<eos> Well, I think we found them.
Let's finish this.<eos> Anna.<eos> You head up.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> Please.<eos> No.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - It was like needles were piercing my skull. And then it just stopped.<eos> I saw at least five vampires go down.<eos> They're taking them to your family's old building.
I found this in his desk.<eos> He won't mind, he's dead.<eos> Yeah, you know what, sure.<eos> Why not.<eos> Hey, what's going on in here, Tyler? Nothing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> You got somewhere else to be?<eos> The Lockwoods have a lot more land than they used to.<eos> The possessions of all the tomb vampires built them quite a fortune.<eos> Yeah, why did you want them dead, hmm?
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...<eos> Vampires and werewolves used to roam freely until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power.
Previously on "the vampire diaries"...<eos> Vampires and werewolves used to roam freely Until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power.
It explains one origin of the werewolf curse traced through virginia.<eos> The short story... 600 years ago, The aztecs were plagued by werewolves and vampires.<eos> They terrorized the countryside, Made farming and hunting impossible.<eos> Until an aztec shaman cursed them,<eos> Making vampires slaves to the sun and werewolves servants of the moon.<eos> As a result, vampires could only prowl at night, And werewolves could only turn on a full moon.<eos> When the full moon crests in the sky, Whosever unlucky enough to fall under the werewolf curse turns into a wolf.<eos> Can they control the transformation?<eos> If it were a choice, it wouldn't be called a curse.<eos> Werewolves will attack humans. But instinct and centuries of rivalry Have hardwired them to hunt their prey of choice...
27 vampires.<eos> Once the flames create chaos, Crawl to the exit under the choir loft.<eos> I'll be there to set you free.<eos> Make sure you're not followed.<eos> I need everyone to believe that I perished in that fire.<eos> You knew that they were going to burn the vampires in the church?<eos> I practically lit the match.<eos> They were your friends.<eos> They were your family.<eos> You just sold them out?
You don't want it, Tyler.<eos> Trust me.<eos> .: Sync Edit by rocielvn :.<eos> All right.<eos> Where's the moonstone?<eos> Deal's a deal.<eos> I answered your questions.<eos> Yeah, I'm not sure, but I'm guessing it's in here.<eos> My dad, he was very kooky about his hiding spots.<eos> But I've figured most of them out over the years.
Not exactly.<eos> What you got?<eos> Oh, this is Isabelle's research from Duke.<eos> Her assistant sent it to me.<eos> Hmm. Vanessa, the hottie.<eos> Yeah, Vanessa, yes.<eos> Now do you remember the old Aztec curse she told us about?<eos> Sun and the moon, blah blah blah.<eos> Aztec curse, cool.<eos> Yeah, supposedly vampires and werewolves used to roam freely until a shaman put a curse on them to limit their power.
Listen, we need to -- either way, you have to be ready for them to run.<eos> Fortunately, tactical support can make a foot chase much more civilized.<eos> Instead of relying on speed and endurance, all you need is a distraction and good timing.<eos> Stings, doesn't it?<eos> I want my lawyer.<eos> Well, that would help if we were cops.<eos> But we work for Nick.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, come on now, Tommy.<eos> You know those marks that come in, just asking to get taken -- who do you think is sending them to you, huh?
No!<eos> Oh, God, Karl, it was... it was awful.<eos> I mean, my children were... were monsters.<eos> They were ruthless and... and conniving.<eos> This cold Turkey is not working for me, not on... on Christmas.<eos> What was I thinking?<eos> I want to go home.<eos> Oh, Nora.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no. I'm not gonna go home and then call them all and drag them over to my house.
- Private?<eos> Are you trying to embarrass me?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> I really didn't think it was such a big deal.<eos> Oh, you know, this isn't fair.<eos> I always miss all of the good stuff.<eos> Kitty, focus, focus.<eos> All right?<eos> Kitty, now listen, did you beat the egg whites until they were stiff?<eos> No, mother. I beat them until they were dead.
- I feel bad.<eos> I heard that things aren't working out too well for you over at Amanda's.<eos> - Where'd you hear that?<eos> - I have ears everywhere.<eos> - It has nothing to do with you.<eos> - I haven't slept in two days.<eos> That has everything to do with you.<eos> I can't help you sleep, Ari.<eos> I need those tapes back.<eos> "Deadline Hollywood" has them.
Karen.<eos> Jesus.<eos> I think there's a part of you that's still interested in a private relationship with Kevin and Karen independent of your parents. In<eos> - I think that worries you. Wi- why would it worry me?<eos> Because I just think that ever since your father found out about Karen's phone call he's been paying much more attention to you.<eos> He got angry, but his anger seems to have comforted you.<eos> It seems that this reaction is what you've been looking for since you were a kid.<eos> Because to you it's a sign that he cares.<eos> And it might seem right now that the way to gain and keep his love is to just reject Kevin and Karen.<eos> And the way to lose his love perhaps is to reach out to them.
I could hear her down on the second floor, preparing her bed.<eos> And I thought I heard her lock her bedroom door.<eos> She did not even come upstairs to check on Naya.<eos> And then I wanted to go to sleep, but I could not stop myself thinking of Julia lying on her bed, who she was thinking of.<eos> I think it all would be better if she ran off with Mr. pale fox or she simply disappears.<eos> Disappears?<eos> What do you... What do you mean by that... disappears?<eos> I have to say that some of the words that you've used today, Sunil...<eos> I really want to understand what it is that you are trying to say to me.<eos> If your feelings are as extreme as I'm hearing them today...
She left Kamala's dinner Wearing extremely short dress... Bright green and extremely short...<eos> You think that she dressed like this For this young writer?<eos> As she was exiting the house, I was sitting alone at the table Looking at Kamala's photo.<eos> So she came and sat next to me, And she looked me in the eyes.<eos> She took my hand And kissed my cheek<eos> And said she was sorry about kamala.<eos> And she was wearing this perfume Which was very strong,<eos> Just like black pepper and Jasmine.<eos> Arun spent the evening with the children.<eos> He gave them their baths, Put them to bed.
Mike, he has to.<eos> He can't, Sam!<eos> That's why we're gonna give Cruz an early release.<eos> Mr. Westen, you're a very clever man.<eos> Cruz is already looking for us.<eos> If he found out that we're holed up in the infirmary...<eos> I'll make sure that he does.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, hey, your pal Cruz is hunting for my friends.<eos> I want you to make sure that he gets the message that he can find them in the infirmary.
Give them some space, Jesse.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I've done this before.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I just got cut off.<eos> Trapped.<eos> The S.U.V. got away.<eos> Don't worry about the S.U.V. Get out of there now.<eos> Cops use checkpoints to catch drunk drivers.<eos> Drug dealers use them to catch people who don't belong in their neighborhood.
The news just said that tropical storm Edgar could make landfall by Tuesday. You're kidding me.<eos> What, we got to go through the whole alphabet?<eos> You know, just promise me the next time an evacuation is called, you'll really go.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> If I'd taken off for Jacksonville like those other chicken littles, who would have found the photograph that saved your skinny butt?<eos> Fair enough.<eos> It's your friends.<eos> I'm gonna give those two morons a piece of my mind.<eos> Mom, please. Do you mind?<eos> I don't want them in my house!
Ems has been notified.<eos> He was planning to hit pd.<eos> Well, you just saved a lot of cops' lives.<eos> Next time brass tries to beat you up, or you beat yourself up, remember that.<eos> Well, the bomber's dead.<eos> That's one less wack job running loose in the world.<eos> I call that a good day's work.<eos> Where are we with our friends from the community center?<eos> Well, none of them had criminal records.<eos> Nothing ties them to the bombing, so I let them walk.
Sam's little girl.<eos> So that's Earnest Boozell, huh?<eos> The "Booze"?<eos> Biggest shark in Vegas.<eos> ♪ Who... are you? ♪ ♪ Who, who, who, who?<eos> ♪ Who... are you? ♪ ♪ Who, who, who, who?<eos> ♪ ♪ I really wanna know ♪<eos> So, all the sharks around ***** Most from Eastern waters, off the Keys, Montauk, Costa Rica.<eos> They arrive via truck, in water tanks.<eos> They're humanely transported. I put them in the aquarium, help them survive the shock.
It spiraled out of control.<eos> Dr. Prescott, this is Nick Stokes.<eos> Nick, Dr. Prescott is Mrs. Santiago's case worker. Oh.<eos> Nice to meet you, Doctor.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, now we're talking about murder. This woman's killing people and packing them away in her house.<eos> Okay, look, I can't explain the presence of the John Doe or the arsenic, but Marta is incapable of violence.<eos> Ooh, I don't know about that.<eos> You ever touch anything of hers?<eos> Dr. Prescott, for argument's sake, if there are more bodies here, is there some method by which Mrs. Santiago might be hiding them?
Ribbon not so much.<eos> We have your fingerprints.<eos> We have your DNA.<eos> You brought this boy into this home! He doesn't belong here!<eos> He has to go!<eos> We know what happened inside that house.<eos> Your mother's illness was hidden behind four walls, but yours was buried in a much deeper place, wasn't it, Alisa?<eos> Your mother caught you dragging Matthew Price's body out to your little garden of bones, didn't she?<eos> She knew what you had done to those boys.<eos> How you lured them and seduced them.
Someone so much as gets a paper cut, gotta shut down.<eos> You're gonna have to shut it down right now, boss.<eos> We need to take a look at it.<eos> We want to talk to everybody who worked that night shift.<eos> Plus we're going to need to see what your "eyes" saw.<eos> You guys got a warrant?<eos> Hey, got one right here.<eos> You can, uh, shred it when we're done.<eos> Except for the big stuff, most clients send their material in padlocked bins.<eos> They fill them up at their offices, arrange secure transport, we take care of the rest.
These are talon marks.<eos> I heard the Irwins had a parrot.<eos> If you are suggesting that the bird is a suspect, he was in his cage with the door closed when we arrived.<eos> Parrots are extremely smart.<eos> You can teach them to do almost anything, even let themselves in and out of their cages.<eos> Well, yeah, it's true, but... there's no way that that bird picked up a knife and stabbed Mrs. Irwin.<eos> Right?<eos> Wh-What is with this family?<eos> Even the animals hate each other.<eos> Why didn't you just separate them, Hodges?
Nobody is on the other side of this issue.<eos> And the pelicans are covered in oil.<eos> Everyone likes pelicans. They bring babies.<eos> - That's storks.<eos> - Oh, right.<eos> Well... We still like them!<eos> Yeah, we do. Um...<eos> I'm gonna give you... - another 20.<eos> Thank you so much!<eos> I'm here for my test results... If you haven't framed them yet.
- Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> We're on our way to Pierce's buddhist open hive.<eos> But first I'm taking these fellows for ice cream as an apology for questioning Pierce's faith.<eos> Pierce says there's this 69th flavor I need to try.<eos> I am excited.<eos> Hey, guys, my car's over there.<eos> Cool.<eos> Guess what.<eos> I'm not actually taking them for ice cream. I am taking them to the county morgue where I have confirmed that Pierce's mother's very un-vaporized corpse will be lying on a stainless steel slab for all to see.
Agnes, cancel my appointments.<eos> What appointments?<eos> Wishful thinking.<eos> It's called alternative energy, the key to a brighter tomorrow.<eos> Notice all the animals wearing sunglasses.<eos> Because it's a brighter tomorrow.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My boys are in elementary school.<eos> They don't make nearly as many dioramas as we do.<eos> The whole environmental club is making them for green week.
So, um what else do you know?<eos> Well, your old friend, Charley Bascom, was a deep-cover Soviet agent, code named Yuri.<eos> Controlled a slush fund for the KGB worth millions.<eos> And you already know this.<eos> Charley's will instructed me to sell the business.<eos> And there's an old safe in the store, so I had a locksmith open it.<eos> I was... shocked at what I found.<eos> There were Russian documents and codes.<eos> I was baffled.<eos> You know, why... why Charley would have them.
This is our fourth lesson.<eos> Are we going to get on the road ever?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really appreciate you taking the time to do this, Joel.<eos> I mean, I know you're not doing anything now that Sydney's back in school.<eos> Yeah, just poppin' those bonbons. Yeah.<eos> You know what I don't believe in?<eos> What's that?<eos> Roofers.<eos> You invite them into your house. They do all this crap work and then you end up paying.
Under no circumstances are we to go down Elm. You got it?<eos> Okay.<eos> There's a really scary house on Elm Street.<eos> It is quite literally a nightmare on Elm Street.<eos> You know what, I know that this seems insane, but we're just trying to help out Max.<eos> No, we're 1,000% behind you.<eos> Whatever route we need to take is absolutely fine. Thank you.<eos> I just want your kids to have fun, too, though.<eos> Honey, glow sticks, Max is afraid of fire.<eos> I got all of these light sticks here because I wanted people to pass them out.
No.<eos> No?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It wasn't.<eos> Oh, gosh.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> I guess I just don't understand, because, you know, they're in the same class together, and they sort of have the same challenges and struggles, and I... I feel like it's a little cruel for Max to be singled out like that.<eos> Uh, well, it wasn't just Max.<eos> You know, there were two other kids in the class.<eos> Emily specifically told us she doesn't want them at her birthday.
Notot too, uh... not too shaggy there.<eos> The Junior's finally hanging out with the cool kids.<eos> I hung out with the cool kids last week.<eos> Bought them beer.<eos> Tried to stay and drink it with them.<eos> Told me to get lost.<eos> Asked them to pay me back for the booze.<eos> Kicked my ass.<eos> Called their school.<eos> Got them banned from the eighth grade formal.
I'm toast.<eos> I'm honey.<eos> I'm Angela Lansbury's left breast.<eos> Lester!<eos> Fried egg.<eos> And I'm bacon.<eos> And together... We're all part of this balanced breakfast.<eos> Wow!<eos> How did you get those costumes so fast?<eos> I had them at home.
What?<eos> Amal got you the data.<eos> He also warned the Pujari brothers to get out.<eos> - No, he didn't.<eos> - Someone sent them a text.<eos> Well, you still got what you wanted.<eos> You made your arrest.<eos> I didn't want to bust the brothers.<eos> I wanted their buyer.<eos> We only arrested them so they wouldn't take off on us.
Practice more at home, understand?<eos> Is lp Man at home, please?<eos> He's gone to Hong Kong.<eos> May I know who's asking for him, please?<eos> It's nothing important.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good morning, Brother Chung So<eos> Good morning Let's eat fried sticks<eos> These fried sticks look very interesting<eos> You are all big eaters, double sticks aren't enough to feed you So I made them triple
It's nothing.<eos> Wife stabbed me.<eos> Uh, listen, Dwight.<eos> There's a little girl in a cab downstairs.<eos> She's freaking out. She says she will not come in unless she can talk to you.<eos> Jess, what's going on?<eos> I finished it.<eos> My parents were always hard on Ivy,<eos> But... Since I went away, I guess it got so much worse.<eos> When she upset them... They'd lock her out back And make her sleep in a broken-down shed
The hatchers are back.<eos> They're determined to put this kid away.<eos> Listen, it ain't right throwing the book on those kids. They can plead guilty to abuse of police resources, Get probation.<eos> But jail time? These are just young kids.<eos> Yeah, Dwight...<eos> And we both know what those people in there were doing to that girl<eos> And what they'll do if they get their hands on her again.<eos> Dwight, I just sent an e-mail to the d.A. 10 minutes ago saying all this, and he agrees.<eos> Good.<eos> 'cause I released them 20 minutes ago.
I don't care about having a date.<eos> What about Floyd's wedding?<eos> If I have to sit through that alone, I will rent a car, set it on fire, and drive it off a waterfall.<eos> I could set you up with my trainer.<eos> He's gay. But not when he's drunk.<eos> No, I don't need help, Jenna.<eos> I know where I'm going to find my date. Because I have already met him.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Jack's mom said to me that there's only a few different types of men in the world.<eos> And at my age, I have met all of them.
And I know Sammy Hagar.<eos> A few years ago, we thought it would be a good idea... to get Roger a checking account to teach him responsibility.<eos> Here's what old Rog did.<eos> Here's check 001, the only check Roger ever wrote.<eos> Please note that in the date line, he's written "Today comma 1783."<eos> It's made out for the amount of $72 million, and it's payable to "Drugs."<eos> In the memo line, it says "For Drugs, yo."<eos> And it's signed "John Travolta."<eos> Anyway, this was the only check he ever wrote.<eos> The rest of the checks have holes in them... because Roger got drunk and raped them.
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, well, she got drunk, and now she's upstairs throwing up.<eos> But she's just a kid.<eos> Who would serve her?<eos> We did, honey. On a silver platter.<eos> You convinced me to relax and let go, and now this happens.<eos> I'm sorry, but we shouldn't feel bad... [Elevator Bell Dings] About wanting a little time for ourselves.<eos> Sweetie, this isn't a honeymoon.<eos> We have kids.<eos> You have got to let this go.<eos> From now on, I am not losing sight of them for two seconds.
Isabel, she's something.<eos> You know, she's just passionate.<eos> Look... There's no way the family will allow Isabel to visit Moses.<eos> Why don't you let me call them?<eos> You can't.<eos> I can't?<eos> Hmm.<eos> Let's say, um, hypothetically, you had to go to the bathroom, and you left your cell phone on this table.<eos> And you just so happen to leave it on the foster parents' number.<eos> And I miraculously called them.
How about that?<eos> You need to talk to Teddy.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Isabel's baby daddy.<eos> Real bad dude. I stay clear away.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> He's got knives and guns.<eos> Teddy told her he didn't want no sick baby.<eos> Ain't no room for a baby like that in this world.<eos> The Greeks took their sick ones and threw them off the cliff.
Well, mine's worse.<eos> That shipment that Boyd blew up was very valuable.<eos> It was sent to me by a friend in Miami.<eos> I have a lot to do to try and repair my relationship with that man, and money alone won't cut it.<eos> To make matters worse, my Miami friend lost a captain and a couple of button men to a certain deputy marshal.<eos> In order for me to get square with him, I'm gonna have to ask you to help me give them Raylan.<eos> Dear Heavenly Father, I'm not gonna pretend to understand.<eos> You told me what you wanted done, and that's what we did.<eos> How could you let it end like this?<eos> All these men trusted me to lead them on the path of righteousness for your name's sake.
On my signal, we go in hot and heavy.<eos> Final warning. Hands where I can see them.<eos> Get out of the vehicle and get down on the ground.<eos> Medina, pull your men back.<eos> You don't know these guys.<eos> But they don't know us.<eos> They do not kill my men and get away with it.<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> - You wanna sit this one out? Fine.<eos> But we're taking them.
Like I wasn't sick enough already.<eos> Where's Abby?<eos> Uh, she's already in the lab, checking the DNA on your victims.<eos> Since I heard we're not the only ones with an unsolved case.<eos> We solved the serial killings.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You would've loved it.<eos> Marine corporal poisoned his victims and then he cut off their feet- bloody stumps.<eos> Then he would take their bodies and put them in a vat of acid.
Can I get back to you on that?<eos> You gonna tell me why I'm here?<eos> I got ten dead bodies, all with one thing in common.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What's that?<eos> You.<eos> Sit down.<eos> According to the DEA, they sold drugs for you.<eos> Allegedly.<eos> At least until Corporal Collins started killing them.
Gibbs doesn't do things like that.<eos> Or-Or-Or does he?<eos> Now I don't know.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> The only thing that I do know is that I didn't find this out by accident.<eos> Rule 40.<eos> "If it seems like someone is out to get you, they are."<eos> Just...<eos> You have no idea how much I wished it was yesterday.<eos> Maybe if I could just close my eyes and open them again, it will be.
You scared the hell out of me.<eos> Okay, I have never been so embarrassed in my life.<eos> First you complain about me being immature, And then you act like that in class Like I needed to be protected.<eos> And everybody knew that there was something weird going on.<eos> God!<eos> What was that?<eos> What? What, were you trying to teach me Some kind of lesson or something?<eos> Because I totally don't need that from you.<eos> And you don't know anything about my parents, So don't say that they have some kind of arrangement Or understanding or something,<eos> Because you don't know them, and you don't know me, okay?
Shall we sing together again Like the ol' times?<eos> Well, that's because I loved<eos> You girl, and I still love you now.<eos> What have you got to say?<eos> That might be true, but I still miss you at night.<eos> When you roll over by my side, and you kiss me goodnight --<eos> It worked, Jesus!<eos> Yeah.<eos> And now to find Muhammad and take down Tom Cruise!<eos> Do you remember when you had My parents killed and fed them to me as chili?
Isn't that kind a lot of planes to have?<eos> We deal with type A personalities and type A personalities know everything in the world<eos> Banking became a pissing contest, you know mine is bigger than yours, that's kind of stuff It was all men that ran it, incidentally.<eos> $15 billions deals weren't large enough so we do $100 billion deals<eos> These people are risk-takers, they're impulsive<eos> Jonathan Alpert is a therapist whose clients include high-level Wall Street executive<eos> That's part of their behavior, part of their personality and that manifests outside of work as well<eos> It's quite typical for the guys to go out, to go strip bars, to use drugs.<eos> I see a lot of cocaine use, a lot of use of prostitution<eos> Recently neuroscientists have done experiments where they've taken individuals put them into MRI machine and and they have them play game where the prize is money
Well... she did just have a baby.<eos> After my mom had my little sister, she couldn't go ten minutes without crying for, like, three months.<eos> Speaking of beautiful babies... hottie at 11:00.<eos> Here he comes.<eos> And here I go.<eos> No, no, no, where?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Ariel, come on, you're into this guy.<eos> And I've got about four days of freedom before my parents find out how I did on that exam.<eos> I'm not going to waste them being a third wheel.
This person has deep emotional problems-- cries a lot, probably a bed wetter.<eos> Loser alert. - Oh.<eos> - Who is it?<eos> Don't know.<eos> There isn't a name. Hey, wait a second.<eos> That's my diary, and obviously your ability has some kinks to be worked out, okay?<eos> It's not funny.<eos> It's personal, guys.<eos> Can you do it with the notes?<eos> Maybe it could give us some clues as to who wrote them.
And she found one on the Huaihai Road<eos> It was called He's Photo Studio<eos> She worked on the till<eos> The studio was run by He Zuoming<eos> A photographer at Shanghai Film Studio<eos> He managed the business himself<eos> My mother worked there as billing clerk<eos> Movie stars came in to take their photos<eos> Jin Yan, Gu Yelu, for example They all had their pictures taken<eos> My mother got to know them and asked if she could work in movies
You up for playing doubles if he brings his daughter along?<eos> Sure!<eos> Hey, you want to volley with me?<eos> Oh, I'd love to, but...<eos> I have a bunch of calls to return, And a prize-winning essay to read.<eos> Don't forget to put it on my desk, okay?<eos> Oh, dad, I-- you don't have to read this one.<eos> It's really not one of my best.<eos> Somebody sure thought it was.<eos> They don't give these awards to people who don't deserve them.
I swam for over 50 years!<eos> You!<eos> Stay right here.<eos> I'm coming back with the men!<eos> - Did you hear something?<eos> - Hear what?<eos> Nothing!<eos> Go check the hives.<eos> See if they're okay from the rain.<eos> Damn stupid wife probably left them out in the rain.
I'm sorry I lied to you.<eos> I was still hoping that Billy would turn up this morning And that this whole nightmare would be over.<eos> I don't know what he's tangled up in.<eos> But he can't be gone.<eos> My boys need their daddy.<eos> So, truth now -- when's the last time you saw him?<eos> Last night.<eos> These two guys drove him home.<eos> You know who these two guys were?<eos> I never seen them before. They were outside for a while, And they were yelling at him.
We're not going to sling mud in the press.<eos> We're just gonna focus on the work.<eos> - Yeah, no, I'm with you.<eos> - I know, and I appreciate it so much.<eos> But it's not just you.<eos> Other doctors support me too.<eos> In fact, Emily peck Said that she would volunteer her time To the clinic if I wanted.<eos> That's impressive.<eos> - I also got the results back from your blood test.<eos> The first time I saw them, I thought I was ading a typo, So I had the lab run it again.
But the Internet never forgets.<eos> Once it's out there, it's out there forever.<eos> Now, we all know about the horrific deaths that get shown on the Web.<eos> The murder of a journalist.<eos> The stoning of an Iranian dissident.<eos> Those murders are immortal.<eos> And this unsub craves that same immortality.<eos> He recognizes his face on theirs And he kills them as a way of saying, "This is what I look like."<eos> We think this also informs his compulsion To take the bodies with him.<eos> He takes them to a secondary location Where we believe he preserves them, So that every time he looks at them,
Divya... That's the guy who donated his kidney to his housekeeper?<eos> - Yes. Why?<eos> - Oh, no reason.<eos> You just didn't mention that he's kind of hot.<eos> - Is he?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I hadn't noticed.<eos> He makes documentaries.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I ought to go in and see them.
- He'll be fine.<eos> He'll recover from his injuries and move on with his life.<eos> - Jimmy will never let me go.<eos> - He'll never know where to find us.<eos> Imagine Tommy growing up along the Seine, speaking French.<eos> He'd be nothing like his father.<eos> Or any of them.<eos> Isadora Duncan has a school on Rue Danton.<eos> The children wear Grecian tunics.<eos> She inspires them to find their muses and free their spirits.
You shot at me on the Boardwalk.<eos> You're confusing me with somebody else.<eos> There's another dago walking around with dog shit on his face?<eos> What happened?<eos> You were supposed to make a deal.<eos> Why didn't you tell me these the motherfuckers that lynched my boy?<eos> - Because I hadn't confirmed it.<eos> - I got all the confirmation I need.<eos> There are four more brothers, Chalky, plus Luciano.<eos> How are we supposed to get to them now?
Is everyone on board willing to starve for them?<eos> We haven't come to that point yet...<eos> How ugly are you willing to let this get, Camile?<eos> I'm just asking because I don't think this has anything to do with the proper treatment of P.O.W.S, and you know it.<eos> They tried to kill us, and we do not have the capability to hold onto these prisoners over the long haul.<eos> They're not all dangerous.<eos> If you would just read my report...<eos> "I was just following orders" is a claim that I've heard before.<eos> People will say anything to save themselves, Camile.<eos> So we're just going to leave them on the next viable planet and then wash our hands of it?
Well, what's the situation with the alien?<eos> Docile.<eos> Not a threat.<eos> You can't know that for sure.<eos> Colonel, there's really no point in arguing about this.<eos> I have to stay here to make sure this works.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> I'll send reinforcements.<eos> I would advise against that.<eos> I'm sending them anyway.
Leave me alone!<eos> Please, mom.<eos> It really is me.<eos> Nurse, nurse!<eos> I know it's a lot to take in. Mom-- Nurse!<eos> Please leave.<eos> What is it?<eos> Ancient?<eos> Some of it.<eos> Those symbols, they looked familiar to me, And then I remembered where I saw them.
I know the difference between a bad dream and someone fondling and sucking my penis.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Jason Volloway... did he ever...<eos> - Touch me?<eos> Never.<eos> He was always around, though.<eos> So, at the very least you think he knew.<eos> There's no way he couldn't have.<eos> No way.<eos> And if I ever had any children, I wouldn't let them anywhere near him.
So tell me what you know about Crystal.<eos> Not much.<eos> You guys were friends, right?<eos> Yeah, but for people Like us, the further you go back, the more painful it usually is, so, honey, you just stick to the day-to-day.<eos> Was it painful for her?<eos> I don't think her parents were bad people... just ordinary, decent folk with a narrow idea of what ordinary and decent meant.<eos> He was 15 when he got out.<eos> They know about the sex change?<eos> No.<eos> Just thinking he was a gay boy sent them into a shit fit.
Stealing is not tolerated here, Mr. Gilmore, and neither is placing the blame on an innocent classmate.<eos> You'll have six weeks to reflect on this, studying in seclusion on the West Campus.<eos> Now, if there are no further questions. This tribunal is adjourned.<eos> Well, I can't say I'm going to miss hearing three guys snore at night.<eos> I'll see you around.<eos> Ian.<eos> I'm glad you were exonerated.<eos> I felt you would be.<eos> It's nice to know you're pulling for me, sir.<eos> Your roommates-- you never put the blame on them, even when you had the chance.
Well, I'm on top of the V's most wanted list... makes me excellent bait.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, to do this, Erica's gonna need a layout of the ship.<eos> Every detail you can remember, everything.<eos> The armada of ships from our home planet have arrived ahead of schedule.<eos> They're within striking range of earth.<eos> Keep them cloaked and at bay.<eos> We don't want them revealed until we're ready for the next stage.<eos> Tyler's mother is joining you tonight for dinner, as planned?<eos> With Agent Evans as my ally on the ground and my newborn army, the humans won't know what hit them.
This isn't my operation.<eos> It's Seidel's. John Seidel.<eos> That's your answer?<eos> John Seidel?<eos> And we're supposed to believe that?<eos> Believe what you want, but it's the truth.<eos> John's crazy.<eos> All of this was John's idea.<eos> We were hired to protect these businessmen.<eos> John killed them along with everyone else in the lab. Except for the doctor.
So...<eos> Leo was on vacation, he gets a tip about this deal, and just like Leo, decides to stop it on his own.<eos> He used Oksana to get closer to Kaminsky.<eos> So the safe deposit box must've been Kaminsky's.<eos> Ooh, this deal is big.<eos> It's dangerous.<eos> Maybe Oksana got caught in the crossfire.<eos> Because whatever was in that safe deposit box almost got Leo killed, too.<eos> Probably the diamonds.<eos> Where would he have stashed them?
- No!<eos> Okay, I guess we'll wait for the fish body removal to get here.<eos> We don't know what's on those diamonds.<eos> They could be what killed the fish.<eos> And Oksana.<eos> Actually, they did.<eos> When I got back to the hotel, I took one of the diamonds out of the container. I--I started to feel sick.<eos> So I--I put it back, and I--I went over to the bathroom.<eos> When I came out, I saw Oksana lying on the floor, and she had all the diamonds in her hand.<eos> She was obviously gonna steal them. So I went to check on her. But I started to feel like I was gonna pass out, so I took a towel, I scooped up all the diamonds, and I put 'em in the fish tank.
We provide...<eos> My sister was part of a drug trial For a new medication called HT1.<eos> A week into the trial, She suffered acute liver failure and died.<eos> Did the drug company offer a settlement?<eos> J.R.P. Pharmaceuticals... The company sponsoring the trial... They sent a very attractive man in a suit to our house.<eos> He said nobody else had any side effects And it was a freak accident.<eos> He sat at our kitchen table, And he wrote a number on a piece of paper. Sitting at the kitchen table where she used to eat pancakes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So, your parents, uh, declined any kind of settlement?<eos> I convinced them not to.
- Is it more convenient than Avis or Hertz?<eos> - Dad!<eos> I just gave them $2,000.<eos> I'm entitled to some information.<eos> Let's go.<eos> New Jersey sucks!<eos> Well, that's just rude.<eos> This is me and this is my collection of the original 26 tarzan novels.<eos> I didn't know you had "The Avengers" Korvac saga.<eos> - Yeah, you can borrow them if you like.
- Right.<eos> So, did you like just know you had to go?<eos> Erm, yeah, pretty much, yeah.<eos> Yeah, see that's how I feel.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I just want rid of her!<eos> Jimbo, I'll see you later.<eos> Dave.<eos> Dave!<eos> The boys are in the tent for the night, don't go out.<eos> - I've just settled them.
Mum!<eos> JACQUl: Irene Webb was only 59 years old when she died.<eos> John Webb also passed away four weeks later.<eos> I wonder if they knew it was their wasted lives that inspired Debbie to leave her mark on the world.<eos> SCULLY: OK, let's start at the beginning.<eos> On the day that Talal Assaad died, Russell came to see me.<eos> Well, he said...<eos> Benny, you got runners on the street now, hey?<eos> I said, "Nah, mate."<eos> And then he says to me, um, "Tell them to get off the strip "because me and John are looking for them."
I can't believe we're burying her and I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.<eos> And you have no idea what she wanted to tell you?<eos> I asked my uncle and he said he didn't know.<eos> She was too terrified to breathe in case it pissed him off.<eos> Whatever it was, she was too scared to tell him.<eos> Imagine feeling like that.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> He was nicer to the dog than he was to her.<eos> Do you remember that time we got the munchies and they ate all his posh birthday biscuits.<eos> I said the dog had eaten them.
Or Sophia.<eos> Is that the reason why you came down here?<eos> To warn me?<eos> I need to know about the plane.<eos> There's no sign of it.<eos> Really?<eos> You were supposed to set it down unharmed.<eos> Why hasn't there been any word from the passengers yet?<eos> Thomas, what happened?<eos> I decided that, since we had the passengers, we might as well use them.
Anyone who's handled it will have trace amounts on them.<eos> I can vet the field teams with the radiation detector.<eos> Do it.<eos> We need to find the traitor before he undermines the entire operation.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Agent Lee.<eos> Lee, we have a situation.<eos> I'm heading your way.<eos> A situation? What are you talking about?<eos> Just gather the members of your field team and hold them there until I arrive.
He can protect us. Trust me!<eos> I did.<eos> I always trusted you, Ames.<eos> - You okay? - Yeah.<eos> You let him get away with the diamonds.<eos> He thinks he did.<eos> Nice work, Ames.<eos> Markus won't be happy.<eos> Markus is still out there, and he's gonna be looking for those, and then he's gonna be looking for her.<eos> Well, he can find them under lock and key back at the museum.
You need to get out of there now.<eos> My lawyers will have me out of there before my fingerprints dry.<eos> Ilsa, did you hear anything I said to you about these guys?<eos> These are not the regular cops, and they're not there to arrest you.<eos> They're gonna take you and hold you hostage, and force us to give them J.D.<eos> Get the hell out of there now.<eos> And what do you suggest I do?<eos> You wearing heels?<eos> Of course.<eos> Take them off.
Well, off you trot, then.<eos> The 2 painters Loker dragged in.<eos> Sometime this year would be nice.<eos> Who's Naomi?<eos> So, no work permit, Mr. Garcia?<eos> I love this country.<eos> If only they'd make you legal.<eos> Is this about the robbery?<eos> Nervous tick.<eos> People from some latin cultures kiss their thumbs and then flick them as a swearing gesture.
That's all right, mate.<eos> Always better to be truthful, don't you think?<eos> Here.<eos> What--what are you-- is this him?<eos> I think we've seen that look somewhere before, don't you, Professor? Recognition.<eos> This junkie recognizes you from somewhere, Teddy.<eos> So, you recognize the killers 'cause you hired them, right?<eos> This is crazy.<eos> I--I'm a witness.<eos> No, you paid them to kill Kira, and then you tried to pin it on Marcus and Rudy.
I'm gonna ask you to be respectful here.<eos> I will politely decline.<eos> Come on, dad, I'm kidding.<eos> All right, I get it.<eos> Who are the old guys?<eos> Boone and Peters, veterans of the SBPD.<eos> Worked under Herb for many, many years.<eos> Volunteers these days.<eos> These guys are legends.<eos> So are leprechauns, but you don't see them rolling out crime tape.
Thank you.<eos> Can your dog do that?<eos> The conditions there are deplorable.<eos> When the children who work in Mr. Moto's diamond mine. Meet their quota, they earn $1.50 a day.<eos> -When they don't, they go hungry.<eos> -Yeah, or worse.<eos> I've fought in these countries.<eos> I've seen these kids.<eos> You make it out of the mine, Well, then you get an M16 in the rebel army.<eos> And Mr. Moto, he smuggles his diamonds into the U.S., and then he launders them through his real-estate holdings here in Boston.
You wanted to send something to the lab? I do.<eos> I got a Jane Doe here.<eos> We don't know what's wrong with her.<eos> So I want you to take this blood<eos> And just run it through the gamut.<eos> You got it. Okay.<eos> Hey, Lana?<eos> This is a very sensitive case. So, uh, when the results come in, Make sure I'm the only one that sees them.
How's it going?<eos> Splendidly.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can we stop this?<eos> Stop what? Being so polite.<eos> Acting like nothing's wrong.<eos> There's nothing wrong.<eos> I thought we were pretty good.<eos> After all, you do have two toothbrushes at my house.<eos> You want me to take them back?
We've been trying to chase you down ever since.<eos> You've been gone for almost a month.<eos> What did you do for food and water?<eos> Well, the pods provide basic nutrients to their occupants.<eos> I never thought I'd say this, but I missed the food here on Destiny.<eos> So, wait a minute-- these aliens helped you out of the goodness of their hearts?<eos> Well, there's a little more to it than that.<eos> They need our help.<eos> The ships that came after us are automated attack drones.<eos> Apparently, years ago, Telford's aliens, the Ursini, made the same mistake that we did and woke them up, and they've been fighting them ever since.
At least not yet, anyway.<eos> Let's keep looking.<eos> They're all in perfect health.<eos> No trace of disease or malnutrition. Just like the day we left them.<eos> What are the odds of that?<eos> Eight adults who've been through what they've been through?<eos> You know, not one of them remembers a damn thing about the planet, or how they got here.<eos> Well, Caine believes that's God's way of telling them they've been reborn.<eos> Was that before or after he gave them amnesia?<eos> The others think that maybe the aliens discovered them and returned them to us as an act of benevolence.
I said don't look.<eos> He's holding yellow forms.<eos> What, you think those are them?<eos> Can you-honestly, can you relax?<eos> You're gonna know what he says soon enough.<eos> Those are definitely them.<eos> Hey, I think he forgot some.<eos> Well, we should probably take those back to him right away.<eos> I mean, before somebody else accidentally finds 'em.<eos> Okay, but we're not looking at them.
Maybe she jumped.<eos> Maybe.<eos> All right, there's too many people Coming and going down there.<eos> I want you in charge Of that body until the coroner comes.<eos> Well, I mean, I can take statements<eos> And brief the detectives when they get here. You got a problem babysitting a body? No.<eos> Dead bodies are part of the job.<eos> Okay.<eos> I mean, look at us- putting up party decorations While he deals with the witnesses.<eos> Well, maybe if I took my job more seriously, He'd let me question them.
Oh, God.<eos> You're late.<eos> I know.<eos> Nine hours late.<eos> How's Greer?<eos> He's going to be okay. You?<eos> You didn't answer your radio.<eos> The battery died... A long time ago.<eos> You didn't come after me. Eli figured out how to track the Kino remotes the same way you did.<eos> We saw two signals heading back this way together, figured one of you had them both and the other was dead.
Mozzie's about to become irrelevant.<eos> - I wanna go in there.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> Take me to Navarro.<eos> Mozzie.<eos> Mozzie.<eos> How did you end up here alone?<eos> I followed your clues.<eos> You did leave them for me?<eos> Yes, yes, from our talks and our books... but I was hoping you would share them with the FBI or the cops.
What's that building, Dad?<eos> That's our outpost.<eos> It's where we work out of when we come up here to study the ground.<eos> Let's see if anyone's home.<eos> Hello?<eos> It's Christmas Eve, Dad.<eos> Yeah, just checking.<eos> Who's calling?<eos> It's probably the base for those engineers.<eos> All right, well, let's just keep an eye out for them.
All right, let's follow Yeti.<eos> Why can't we just buy a tree like everyone else?<eos> I don't even have anything to put under it.<eos> I've got something to put under the tree for Dad. Hey!<eos> Well, what do you got there, champ?<eos> I can't tell you that, Dad.<eos> It's your Christmas present.<eos> Yeah, Dad, I can't believe you'd ask something like that.<eos> What?<eos> When I have kids, I'm not gonna make them go chopping down trees in the middle of winter.
- You're hopeless!<eos> I hope you die!<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> All right.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - It's a stocking, Nigel.<eos> But there's still a month to go.<eos> We thought we'd give you your presents early this year, as a special treat.<eos> We thought we'd open them in the morning.<eos> I don't want them in the morning.
We thought we'd give you your presents early this year, as a special treat.<eos> We thought we'd open them in the morning.<eos> I don't want them in the morning.<eos> It'll spoil Christmas.<eos> Nigel, please.<eos> Your mother asked me specially.<eos> OK. I suppose so.<eos> So you're not gonna tell me off, then?<eos> No, I'm not gonna tell you off.<eos> But you mustn't open them till Mum's there.
Take him into the locker room.<eos> I don't want a mess on the floor. I work here.<eos> Why me?<eos> It'll make me feel better.<eos> After all, Franco brought you into the fold.<eos> Like I said, the locker room.<eos> Don't make a mess.<eos> It's just costume jewelry, family heirlooms.<eos> Worthless.<eos> Yet you keep them in a safe.
- Okay.<eos> - Okay, now I get to tell you where we're going.<eos> Chicago.<eos> Exciting, right?<eos> Cubs, second city, deep-dish pizza.<eos> - I hate baseball, I don't know what that second thing is, And I'm lactose intolerant.<eos> - But we have your sunny disposition.<eos> So there's that.<eos> Since 1970, the federal Witness Protection program Has relocated thousands of witnesses-- Some criminal, some not--<eos> To neighborhoods all across the country. Every one of those individuals shares a unique attribute, Distinguishing them from the rest

Did three years after he beat one of his employees to death During a fight over money.<eos> That is not good leadership.<eos> Go talk to him.<eos> Gentlemen, step out a minute.<eos> Give me a chance to talk to the detectives in private.<eos> So, you want to tell us where you were last night, Mr. Funk?<eos> Call me Ron.<eos> A-and it's funny you ask.<eos> I was, uh, breaking bread with my fellow associates there.<eos> You want me to call them back in?
I thought Victoria fixed it.<eos> She did.<eos> And you know how?<eos> By screwing our investors.<eos> We are surviving at the expense of all these people who put their hard-earned savings in our hands.<eos> Okay, well...<eos> There's got to be some other way out.<eos> I've gone over everything.<eos> There isn't.<eos> How can I set foot in my store, in our offices, knowing that I kept them by deceiving people?
Is anybody even home?<eos> There's only one way to find out. Go for it.<eos> You sure you want to ring that bell?<eos> Guess you haven't heard about the guy who lives here.<eos> Here we go.<eos> What guy?<eos> Nobody's ever seen him.<eos> But I heard he snatches up kids who step on his porch.<eos> Then he makes them eat a bunch of food to fatten them up.<eos> Then he cooks them.

Catchy<eos> I've got two minutes before a Community Support Officer comes around that corner. Can we do this while I'm working?<eos> - Know the author?<eos> - I recognise the paint.<eos> It's like Michigan... hard-core propellant.<eos> I'd say zinc. And what about the symbols?<eos> Do you recognise them?<eos> I'm not even sure it's a proper language.<eos> Two men have been murdered, Raz.<eos> Deciphering this is the key to finding out who killed them.
- Yes!<eos> I knew you'd get there eventually.<eos> West wasn't killed here, that's why there was so little blood.<eos> - How long have you been following me?<eos> - Since the start.<eos> You don't think I'd give up on a case like this just to spite my brother, do you?<eos> Come on, we've got a bit of burglary to do.<eos> Missile defence plans haven't left the country, otherwise Mycroft's people would have heard about it.<eos> Despite what people think, we do still have a secret service.<eos> Yeah, I know, I've met them.
- Oh, I am playing.<eos> This is my turn.<eos> There's shaving foam behind your left ear.<eos> Nobody's pointed it out to you.<eos> Traces of where it's happened before, so obviously you live on your own. There's no-one to tell you.<eos> But there's a photograph of children.<eos> The children's mother's been cut out.<eos> If she'd died, she'd still be there.<eos> The photograph's old, but the frame's new.<eos> You think of your children, but you don't get to see them.

And it still hurts.
- That's all.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Um, am I the only one that thinks something suspicious is going on over at Ride World?<eos> There's a new ride. The Wacky Yacky Arm Buster.<eos> It's like you're on an African safari and then they drop you 10 feet onto your right arm.<eos> - Mm, not for me.<eos> I get dizzy.<eos> - That's it.<eos> The ride is unsafe and these stupid kids go over there and they get hurt.<eos> Then Daffy Giraffy drops them off so Ride World isn't liable for their injuries.
What makes you think that?<eos> Come on, when you've created as many aliases as I have, You know what to look for.<eos> Dr. Charles Grant reads like a textbook cover, Jo.<eos> Chuck's hiding something.<eos> Like what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're the head of security.<eos> Don't you want to find out?<eos> Zane, Grant went through detailed background checks Like everyone at G.D...<eos> I did them myself.
What the hell's all this?<eos> Did you see where the women came with food?<eos> There was a gap under the wire like a hole.<eos> You want to go now?<eos> Not at night.<eos> It's too quiet.<eos> And they have searchlights.<eos> In daytime we're outside. It's easier. With all the noise and sobbing kids.<eos> And if it's as hot as today the police will stay in the shade.<eos> We need to find more sweaters. We'll grab lots and put them all on.
Who are these guys?<eos> Just a couple of old motherfuckers who have gotten away with things for too long.<eos> What's your plan now?<eos> Daydreaming again, old man?<eos> No, just thinking.<eos> Do you recall how we met?<eos> Oh, so you're in a gloomy mood.<eos> No.<eos> I saw a few toads in the neighbor's yard...<eos> And you remembered how we used to stomp them to death.
- I am letting it go, Lily.<eos> Me and RJ are done.<eos> - Idiot.<eos> - Oh, you're a lifesaver, honey.<eos> - I'm still not quite sure how all your cookware ended up at the bottom of the pool, but you're welcome.<eos> - Let's get you inside and warm you up.<eos> - Miss--Linda.<eos> Where are my-- where are my clothes?<eos> I gotta get that ride over to Jenny's party.<eos> - I put them in the dryer to warm them up.
So, RJ, why do you want to join the purity club?<eos> I'm proud of you, dude.<eos> Weaseling your way into the purity club?<eos> Pure genius.<eos> I'm surprised you never tried it.<eos> Oh, I did, but those vadge-nazis saw right through me.<eos> I'd have to say my favorite part of the bible is the book of job.<eos> It's "Jobe."<eos> Thou shall not use teeth.<eos> So what'd you tell them that got you in?
But what might these primitive skins around the cells have looked like?<eos> Jack found inspiration in soap bubbles.<eos> So, these are delicate.<eos> They really illustrate the idea that there's an encapsulated space.<eos> That was pretty good.<eos> Soap bubbles are made from molecules called fatty acids, primitive chemicals that Jack thinks were produced on the primeval earth inside hydrothermal geysers.<eos> The right kinds of minerals could catalyze the assembly of fatty acids from simple things like carbon monoxide, methane, water.<eos> One kind of nice way that that could happen is in a hydrothermal-vent system, and then they could bubble up to the surface.<eos> So Jack set about re-creating the chemistry of a geyser in his lab and eventually created fatty acids.<eos> Now he mixes them into a primordial chemical soup made of water, salt, and amino acids, and he watches as a remarkable transformation takes place.
You can't talk about Mono Lake without being a little wistful.<eos> You feel like you're on another planet.<eos> It also contains very interesting compounds.<eos> Of particular interest to me was very high levels of arsenic.<eos> There's roughly 40,000 times or so the recommended arsenic from, say, the E. P.A.<eos> So it seemed to me logically that it could harbor potentially the vestiges of a shadow biosphere.<eos> Felisa was not disappointed when she dug in the mud of Mono Lake.<eos> She did, indeed, find bugs that could survive these highly toxic doses of arsenic.<eos> And her new found interest in this poison didn't just cause ripples with her scientific colleagues.<eos> I came home one day, and I brought all these books in, and I put them on my counter.
But Garcia can't touch you. He needs the coordinates.<eos> So he gets you to kill Ollie and steal back the merchandise. Ha!<eos> Two birds with one stone, so to speak.<eos> No.<eos> The birds were gone when I got there.<eos> And Ollie was dead.<eos> I swear.<eos> Garcia told me if I don't find those birds and bring them back to him, he's gonna kill me.<eos> I couldn't find them anywhere.<eos> Why shouldn't I believe you just flew off with them?
I'll eat someone's hat.<eos> Not someone who's using their hat - I don't want to shock a nun, or something.<eos> Sorry, rambling, cos...cos this isn't working!<eos> The controls are isomorphic - one to one - they respond only to me.<eos> Oh, you fibber...<eos> Isomorphic!<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> These controls are isomorphic!<eos> The skies of this entire world are mine.<eos> My family tamed them, and now I own them.
Hmm. Okay, so just keep in mind that this is a rough cut.<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe we should wait.<eos> Fred, be quiet.<eos> Let's start the show.<eos> Hi.<eos> Welcome to harrison parker.<eos> Let me show you around.<eos> Imagine never having to set foot outside the office When you need to forage for the major food groups.<eos> We provide them all.
- It's my refuge.<eos> Bill can be around Geoff all day at the restaurant, but I'm not his brother.<eos> - You don't like your brother-in-law?<eos> - I hate how he treats my husband.<eos> I'd walk away from Geoff and this place in a heartbeat if I could.<eos> - But Bill won't go?<eos> - Three generations of McShaws have owned that place.<eos> Bill's held it together all by himself for years.<eos> - So... why did he ask Geoff to come back?<eos> - Their parents made them promise to keep the business.
- Oh, do I have a...<eos> Is there a zipper undone?<eos> - No, no, it's not that.<eos> - Uh, it's just that you look, uh... Nice.<eos> - Nice?<eos> Yeah, I've been getting a lot of that lately.<eos> I'm trying to find something to wear to this restaurant opening tonight.<eos> - Uh, yes, of course.<eos> The McShaw boys are having trouble again, aren't they?<eos> - Uh, always figured Duke would get them in hot water sooner or later.
Is that true?<eos> I'll know in about a week.<eos> But it won't matter much if we can't stop Jesse and the others.<eos> But I found this book at the library that might help.<eos> Believe it or not, not everything is on the net.<eos> Let's see.<eos> "A History of Whitechapel, 1894."<eos> "The town of Whitechapel was actually once known as Black's Church, "founded in 1809 by Reverend Horace Black.<eos> "Black's disciples preyed upon the nearby townspeople<eos> "until the night of a lunar eclipse, "when an angry mob trapped them all in their place of worship and burned it to the ground.
How much is that going to cost to repair?<eos> Er, about Â£30,000, I'm afraid.<eos> Jesus, what a nightmare!<eos> I just said Jesus.<eos> I'm so sorry, Vicar.<eos> It's OK, Patrick, we all slip up.<eos> Ah good, but that's a fucking nightmare for you.<eos> I mean, for all of us, the, the window.<eos> I hope Adam's not tapping my parents for cash for his window.<eos> He's supposed to be interrogating them to see if they're God fearing Christians.
- Come on!<eos> - Is he OK?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He's fine.<eos> He gets very grumpy when he's tired.<eos> Yes, this is going really well.<eos> Amazingly, no cock-ups so far.<eos> Well done, you've mastered walking like a knob and looking like a dick at the same time.<eos> This is actually enjoyable in an "I'm shitting myself" kind of way.<eos> If you've shit in them trousers, I'm ain't touching them.
You're shit out of luck on that one, man.<eos> Nigel the valet used to supply, but he's on strike.<eos> I'm really good at moving product.<eos> I could be your biggest customer.<eos> Kish.<eos> - She's cute.<eos> How old is she?<eos> - He is five.<eos> You got cash?<eos> So, your trimmings, you throw them away?
You have to keep me alive so I can lead you to him.<eos> I didn't know what to say.<eos> I didn't want to die.<eos> Guests have been asking where they can get certain herbal items.<eos> - What the hell is this?<eos> - Hash.<eos> When I get a request, I put you on the housekeeping schedule for those rooms.<eos> The guests will put the money under the pillow, you leave the hash.<eos> You got cash?<eos> So, your trimmings, you just throw them away?
And the king was freed, and the castle was restored, and the Frost Queen returned home once more.<eos> This time, she was a hero.<eos> And the Frost Queen promised her children that she would never ever leave them again.
What don't you want her to know?<eos> You know the moose that attacked your dad?<eos> This plaque says that he shot one up in Arrow...<eos> Aroostook.<eos> - Two years ago? - Uh-huh.<eos> You think that was the same one?<eos> Do you see a moose?<eos> Wolfie over there, shot by Donnelly.<eos> This one by T.R. Holt.<eos> The animals are coming alive and killing the people who killed them.
Do you think this was one of those rabid animals?<eos> The animals aren't rabid.<eos> You've heard about the troubles, haven't you?<eos> The troubles.<eos> We found this inside an animal that was killed while attacking someone.<eos> Recognize this stuffing?<eos> All the attacking animals are stuffed... By you.<eos> This is, uh... this is ours.<eos> It came from the moose the Chief killed two years ago.<eos> The animals are killing the people who killed them, and yours must be coming after you, too.
It's my fault.<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> He said he wanted to destroy all the animals.<eos> He can't do that.<eos> Why?<eos> I can feel them.<eos> They're all waking up.<eos> But I thought Landon was the taxidermist.<eos> He was.<eos> I never sewed them.
- All right, you're on.<eos> - It's kinda funny, You're not a mom, but you have two kids,<eos> You're not in a relationship, yet you live with a guy.<eos> And you haven't been on a real date in six weeks.<eos> 12.<eos> - No, I am totally fulfilled in my new life.<eos> - Oh. But tell me, rhonda, are there still men out there<eos> And do they still take women on romantic dates to restaurants<eos> - And try to take advantage of them?<eos> - They do, god bless them.
Come on.<eos> I got it.<eos> Brad Pitt's got New Orleans covered, right?<eos> So, starving children in Africa.<eos> George Clooney's taking care of them.<eos> What?<eos> Since when?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Since he won the Oscar, dude.<eos> He's saving, like, all the starving kids, and then, he sells them to Angelina Jolie, who flies them over here and feeds them, bro.
There weren't any hunters.<eos> That's what they thought.<eos> I don't know what's going on with you, but I will not let what happened to your father and Jeremy... Happen to you.<eos> Well, I hope everybody likes tarte tatin.<eos> Oh. Claire, this is incredible.<eos> Well, don't speak too soon.<eos> You haven't tried it yet.<eos> Well, what he's really trying to say is,<eos> "see, Lauren?<eos> Some wives actually cook meals and not just defrost them."
Go home. Let me do my job.<eos> Everything comes out.<eos> Please. Sit.<eos> So... Do you want to tell me about St. Louis?<eos> St. Louis is where we found Emily.<eos> What do you mean, "found"?<eos> What happened to her parents?<eos> I met them.<eos> We socialized. Briefly.<eos> And then I murdered them.
Although, if Andie hasn't caught it by now, I'm sure... mom!<eos> Okay.<eos> But I'm keeping my eye on you two.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> No, no.<eos> She seems really nice.<eos> Uh, here.<eos> I went a little heavy on the chick flicks, but they're my favorites.<eos> "Secrets of my heart."<eos> Oh, and you hate them, don't you?
I just was wondering, what is meant by the fatigue problem?<eos> Yeah, I'm curious about that, too.<eos> It's also my first PTA meeting.<eos> I work, hi.<eos> The fatigue problem is what was identified in the first quarter of this school year as being a marked decline in the spirit and interest and energy of the kids here. Usually around noon or right after lunch.<eos> It's because of the lunch.<eos> They aren't given enough time to eat.<eos> No, it's not that...<eos> they're being demoralized.<eos> You fill them with academics, you don't tell them who they are.
Tell me.<eos> Three.<eos> Crastor and Lycos, Boreas.<eos> — Outright?<eos> — Yes, Captain.<eos> — Permission to extract their gene seed.<eos> — Granted.<eos> May the Emperor bless and protect this sacred legacy, so that the strength of these brave warriors may live on in Ultramarines as yet unborn.<eos> For the abiding honor of our fortress home, Macragge, in the name of the Chapter and the Primarch, to whom we owe all.<eos> We shall mourn them later, if the Emperor grants us time.
She's so out of control.<eos> Only the ones heading for trouble.<eos> So, guess what?<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, where Mum's dragged my dad.<eos> My name... is Gita Chandra.<eos> And I've seen aliens.<eos> Welcome to the British UFO Research and Paranormal Studies Society,<eos> Well, we've all seen them.
I'll be doing tomato and lentil soup.<eos> Sounds thrilling(!<eos> ) Believe me, Mr Chandra, Ealing is a thrilling place.<eos> The aliens are watching us, and maybe just waiting for the right moment.<eos> No, I'm not listening to you, no.<eos> Gita, they're called BURPSS.<eos> They're a bunch of wind bags.<eos> Why do you believe to refuse to believe what you've seen with your own eyes?<eos> I'm not denying aliens exist, but whatever they were doing here was a one-off.<eos> You're not going to see them again.
There was creaking and a high pitched whistling coming from all over the place.<eos> What is that horrible smell?<eos> I think I do hear something.<eos> You do; what is it?<eos> The spooked ramblings of a teenager who when his dad went away for a conference stayed up all night watching horror movies.<eos> That has nothing to do with it, okay.<eos> I know what I heard and I know what I smelt.<eos> You meant the candles?<eos> No, I mean you, specifically your clothes.<eos> When was the last time you washed them?
It was my grandmother's recipe but my father would make it for us on Thanksgiving - makes it traditional for me.<eos> She cannot take all three of us.<eos> No I can't, but those men will be along and trust me, they can.<eos> Trust you?<eos> How can we trust you when you are acting like a Russian spy?<eos> I am as American as you He.<eos> I have even lived her longer.<eos> And what about your friends?<eos> They are not my friends.<eos> I only met them two weeks ago.

Unless you have a better idea!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Two Mykas-- this is gonna be fun.<eos> Hey, a compass--maybe this is some sort of homing device that always points at Artie.<eos> No, no, that would be too easy.<eos> Holy crap!<eos> W-what does that do?<eos> It holds Artie's glasses.<eos> Right, so I can understand your excitement.<eos> But Artie always loses his glasses, which is why Claudia rigged them so he could always find them!
Did you get in trouble, too?<eos> Just came to see how you were doing.<eos> You miss me.<eos> May I?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm sorry about lunch.<eos> That was... weird and uncomfortable.<eos> The rules are the rules.<eos> So, what do they have you doing down here?<eos> Well, um, we go through all these papers one by one and sort them according to geography.
Your wife will be deemed a bit 'more or is it still on the planet diaper?<eos> It 's still on the planet diaper but do not panic!<eos> Regain Intimacy As soon as the child ... has a mustache.<eos> Meanwhile, I can do something?<eos> No, you do not, thank you.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - A little bit 'of torticollis.<eos> By dint of seeing you play ...<eos> Psychosomatic a stiff neck ...<eos> Did you know that diapers also make them with elastic side bands system"and"keep it all inside?
Who are these two fat guys?<eos> These?<eos> They are the uncles of Molise.<eos> Remember who are facing difficulties to speak Italian?<eos> We have got that horrible under the horse dies.<eos> It was a dead donkey ... ugly.<eos> Horrible.<eos> Watch ...<eos> These are my classmates.<eos> - I remember them ... ugly.
So that thing blocks British radar?<eos> Right now the glorious German fleet is preparing to depart harbours all along the Dutch and Belgian coast.<eos> Your so-called British Intelligence will not suspect until it is far too late.<eos> We know.<eos> Clyde and me.<eos> And what can two schoolboys do?<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> I've taken on bigger loonies than you lot.<eos> I've fought hideous, bug-eyed monsters.<eos> And defeated them all, with this!
Come with me if you want to live.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here we are safe.<eos> Now you can start answering some of my questions.<eos> We can't stay here.<eos> Volkoff has contts in the CIA.<eos> We have to move.<eos> We should believe u, because last time usting you worked out so well.<eos> Chuck, I didn't want to have to do the things I did.<eos> Most people's momson't have to explain to their kids why they shot them, or tied them up and blew up their childhood home.
I get it.<eos> Have fun playing Halo for the rest of your life.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Hey, eulogy guy.<eos> - Oh... okay. I'm looking for Casey.<eos> Uh, Casey who?<eos> That Casey.<eos> I've got a message for him.<eos> We've got his friends.<eos> We're taking them on a little gold-digging trip.
Explain what?<eos> That you're telling a co-worker something you haven't told me yet?<eos> Or that you don't want kids?<eos> All right, look.<eos> It shouldn't have come out like that.<eos> You know, Kelly, she shouldn't have said anything.<eos> Oh, okay. So now it's Kelly's fault?<eos> Do you want to take any responsibility for anything?<eos> Like these papers?<eos> Fern was dropping them off when I pulled up.
It's an added expense, but...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whatever it takes. Money's no problem.<eos> Okay. Well, I have a list of contacts in the main office.<eos> Why don't you come with me.<eos> Stay here, okay?<eos> Gosh, this is so... Typical.<eos> While every other teenager in the world is getting ready for homecoming, I will be getting my head examined.<eos> I spent most of my life in hospitals.<eos> I... I hate them.
I just saw it, Lee.<eos> Okay, we've got it covered, Allison.<eos> If Kira goes after Paul, we'll pick her up.<eos> I couldn't sleep.<eos> Please just tell me everything's all right with you.<eos> Paul's dead, Allison.<eos> She got to him before we could stop her.<eos> BOY: Dad's gonna kill me.<eos> What'd you do now, Mr. Good?<eos> I was in the garage playing with Dad's tools, just looking at them, you know.
No, no, no.<eos> That was me. I've painted it twice now.<eos> Came out to get the paper this morning, and there it is again.<eos> You know Judy and I put our place up on the market, right?<eos> Every time a potential buyer drives by, they take one look at that eyesore, and they run the other way.<eos> It's killing my property value.<eos> It's killing all of our property values.<eos> That's why I'm going around asking everybody just to keep a lookout for these idiots.<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> I appreciate that. I mean, maybe one of us will catch these punks in the act and get them arrested.
Maybe.<eos> It's also possible the car bomb's just the first explosion.<eos> If the garage was lined with secondary charges, you'd definitely feel it everywhere, especially if the building came down.<eos> Any sense of what kind of car this man was driving?<eos> I only saw his face.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, then, let's first generate a sketch of the man you saw driving the car and make sure that both the police and the folks in charge of security at that building have it.<eos> You know, the Department of Commerce occupies several floors over there.<eos> Odds are, they're the target.<eos> I'm going to notify my colleagues on the federal side and make them aware that there is a credible threat against 414 Wright.
We're not the only ones trying to trace the call.<eos> Mason.<eos> He must be running some kind of a sniffer program.<eos> Can you find the source?<eos> No, we already have the address. But, boss, if we can find Mason, that means the kidnappers can, too.<eos> NCIS!<eos> Mr. Mason, if you're in there, please open up.<eos> Lock is broken.<eos> Kidnappers appear to have gotten here first.<eos> Looks like Mason was waiting for them.
Reason enough to want military protection at home.<eos> Boss, I found a series of messages in Haskell's e-mail history discussing an anniversary gift for his wife.<eos> McGee, his wife has been dead for over a year.<eos> Makes a custom wristwatch kind of an odd choice.<eos> Obviously it was a code.<eos> How do you know this?<eos> Haskell met last week with a Deeter Johanson.<eos> He is not a watchmaker.<eos> Mr. Johanson is a chef.<eos> Former meth cooker from South Africa who, according to Homeland Security's wanted list, now bakes specialized explosives and sells them on the black market.
I'm Jordanian Sunni.<eos> You think I will let my daughter marry a Shiite?<eos> To plant a tomato in a corn field?<eos> No, tomatoes are over here and corn is over here.<eos> That's common sense.<eos> Randy, my desperate, crooked friend,<eos> I have a proposal for you.<eos> I will get you your passports.<eos> In return, you will make certain this wedding does not happen.<eos> I see. So, you want me to break them up?
No.<eos> Uh... E.M.T.?<eos> Nurse.<eos> A male nurse.<eos> That is so cool.<eos> You should get the biodegradable ones.<eos> Right.<eos> Uh, so, what happened between you and your girlfriend?<eos> Oh, we didn't agree about kids.<eos> Oh, she wanted them, you didn't? No.
It'll bring out your eyes more.<eos> Oh, you're a photographer?<eos> Freelance.<eos> You're Sutton's new girl, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're a natural.<eos> You have a gift.<eos> I have a gift.<eos> Hey, how many of these things can you drink anyway?<eos> Oh, well, I'm not actually drinking them.
Leena.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And if something should go wrong?<eos> Taka will make it right.<eos> Marines.<eos> You saw Marines?<eos> Yes, but like from World War II.<eos> Probably some guys playing dress-up like civil war nuts.<eos> Mm-hmm. Were they locals?<eos> I've never seen them before.
Uh-oh.<eos> Wha--wha--what's-- what's the matter?<eos> Why "uh-oh"?<eos> Artie, he changed his signature!<eos> Meaning what, exactly?<eos> It's a totally different layout.<eos> I'd have to reverse it.<eos> Aaghh! I need the Farnsworth blueprints.<eos> No, no, they're locked in tech.<eos> But I was just taking a gander at them back at Leena's.

You could have at least told him it was a dare first.<eos> What is she so pissed about?<eos> It's not like she knows the guy.<eos> It was still wrong, though. You wanna know the lamest part?<eos> That was my first kiss.<eos> So, uh, parents weekend starts tomorrow.<eos> I know.<eos> I can't wait.<eos> - That's nice. - I can't wait to tell them exactly what I think of them, like what hypocrites they are.<eos> And how I probably will never forgive them for how they've treated me.
You got a nice house here, Paul. - Oh, yeah, thanks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It was a little beat up when we moved in, but Cathy really whipped it into shape.<eos> You know, I mean, I'm a creative guy, but I need a computer, you know?<eos> I'm virtually creative.<eos> Cathy... true artist...<eos> You know, albeit repressed if you ask me.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> I mean, she makes these cards for Adam, our son, the first day of school every year.<eos> She... she, like, decorates them with puffy paint and, like, does these little collages, you know, with pictures and stuff.
Do you mind if we come alone?<eos> Allright, stay out off our way.<eos> Steve would you get my bag?<eos> I'm allright my love.<eos> Everyone listen carefully.<eos> Hadji, the FBI will track everything.<eos> Your supermarket, your phones, everything.<eos> We'll hide the cars somewhere where they can't be found and cover them with some tarps.<eos> Noah we'll give everyone new phones including Timur.<eos> Use them only when absolutely necessary.
Oh. You think he did it in the spyker?<eos> Maura, I'm sorry.<eos> You okay?<eos> I should've seen it.<eos> You did.<eos> There is a reason that you didn't commit to him after college.<eos> There is a reason that you're holding back now.<eos> It's called gut instinct.<eos> But there were clues, and I...<eos> I couldn't put them together.
"When he suddenly recollects...<eos> "What, precisely?<eos> "Deja vu?<eos> "Some artistic analogy?<eos> "Too bad.<eos> Let it go.<eos> "On the threshold, "on the edge of a shadow-world that is yet to welcome him, "he stands and waits.<eos> "Waits for a waiter.<eos> "First disappointing thing - "no sign of Massimo, "nor of his old staff.<eos> "Massimo's pirate crew, as he privately thought of them,
Where are you this time?<eos> God, I'm sorry.<eos> - Sorry indeed.<eos> I hadn't expected you to have gone to seed with quite such abandon.<eos> Or is this some sort of... cock-eyed performance you're putting on for my special benefit?<eos> I think I need to think about that one.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, while you're doing that, I'll tell you what I think.<eos> For which we need to go back to your poems.<eos> It strikes me you don't understand them yourself.
There are, however, a couple of chinks in the AMG's armour.<eos> Where the Camaro costs L40,000, this is 72,000.<eos> A muscle car should also be a car for simpletons, like me, but there are more gizmos in here than Bill Gates's kitchen.<eos> The gearbox, for example, can be operated from here or down here, and then this dial splits it into four different modes - comfort, sport, sport plus and so on.<eos> This button adjusts the traction control, lots of settings there.<eos> This button is for the ride, lots of different settings.<eos> And that's a lot to think about if you're the kind of person who goes to work in a vest.<eos> Thankfully, help is at hand.<eos> It's this the fourth button here, the AMG button.<eos> Essentially, it takes all the other settings from all the other buttons and puts them in a thing, and then when you hit this button, it sets the car up exactly as you want it.
You tell her the same thing you tell her every day. Don't give up.<eos> Look, all I'm saying is, is I don't understand why we can't have a couple of days off in between jobs.<eos> We just spent 10 days in Juarez.<eos> What's the matter? You don't like the pinata? All right, listen.<eos> No... no time off, all right? We got a lot of work to do. Hardison, run it.<eos> All right. The first rule of crime is follow the money.<eos> Now, Ms. Salazar's money ran through three different shell companies before it ended up with this guy.<eos> Hugh Whitman.<eos> He runs a big debt collection agency right outside of Boston called financial support associates.<eos> Well, it makes sense. I mean, he's got bill collectors already on his payroll. He just sends them after people that owe back taxes.
It's, uh, same creek, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, no paved roads. No people for miles.<eos> In the middle of nowhere.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Nate, hey?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Hardison?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Can't talk very loud.<eos> These militia guys are following us, and they're armed and I'm pretty sure we pissed them off.
Go! Go, go, go!<eos> Chester!<eos> Chester, what the hell happened here?<eos> Chester!<eos> Hey! What the hell's going on?<eos> Oh, never mind.<eos> Never mind.<eos> Listen, there's too much heat on the organization right now.<eos> I have to get out of town.<eos> I want you to take the men and take them to a safe house.
The sword.<eos> The samurai carried only one katana, it was forged to exact specifications, no two are alike.<eos> Listen to this - the hilt is hollow and the blade is made of a cheap alloy.<eos> It's manufactured not handmade.<eos> Now check this out...<eos> It's a duplicate.<eos> The thieves are stealing the real artifacts and...<eos> The shogun's heart.<eos> I am happy to say the shogun's heart is authentic.<eos> That's because we interrupted them - twice.
Fine.<eos> Heart of stone, that kid.<eos> God.<eos> That's the saddest fuckin' thing I've ever seen.<eos> God.<eos> Oh, hi, Cathy.<eos> What did you do to Marlene's fish?<eos> Oh, we feel really bad about that. But we didn't know what else to do. We had to take the tank down.<eos> We tried flushing them down the toilet, but they kept coming back up.<eos> I'm sure someone would have taken them.
I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank.<eos> I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset.<eos> And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, So he's become a monster.<eos> I need to make this right.<eos> - I came down here to feed the feral cats Like I usually do, And I found something unsavory<eos> In the back of your nephew's car. - Okay, you know what?<eos> Just... just back off.<eos> Back off!<eos> - Well, take a look. It's all the packages he was supposed to overnight.<eos> He never bothered to send them.
- Yeah, you're scratching.<eos> Look, let me see, because I think I know what they look like.<eos> Get off, get down.<eos> Let's just accept we've all got them, OK?<eos> This, apparently, is what your mum used.<eos> Yeah, well. That might be all right for her hair if you do it properly, but mine's too long.<eos> - Not if I do it carefully.<eos> - But you won't do it carefully enough and I'm going to Edinburgh and I can't have nits!<eos> Lucy, only people with clean hair have nits.<eos> Yes, and you probably got them from your posh dad.
Quite an historical detective Henry.<eos> How about his plant, is it really the fountain of youth?<eos> Dante and I were researching the Ponce de Leon legend for a book.<eos> It led us to the remnants of a tribe of fierce warriors off the island of Bimini.<eos> It was said that their success in battle was attributed to a mythical berry called the 'Puquio Mozo'<eos> The fountain of youth.<eos> Yes, but not in the traditional sense.<eos> It did not grant you eternal life; merely strength in battle.<eos> Kind of like a super food or a supplement.<eos> It gave these warriors strength over others so they couldn't be defeated, earning them the title of the immortals.
I told them not to drink the water but I think it's too late.<eos> Where is Shelly?<eos> Shelly, the cheerleader Shelly?<eos> She is Ortese's intern; we have to find her.<eos> Over here, over here.<eos> Listen carefully.<eos> These kids have been given a potentially lethal organic steroid that could sent them into shock or worse.<eos> We need a sedative to counteract their adrenalin, okay?<eos> You're going down Bartlett!<eos> We were killing them until you started that fight.
- Do not let her in the house.<eos> Spicer's sister's not in her apartment.<eos> The building manager said she left hours ago.<eos> Morgan and Spicer?<eos> No one's been in or out since the power went down.<eos> Morgan said they were coming here, right?<eos> And he was a lot closer than any of us.<eos> Something must have changed.<eos> The cells are down.<eos> Now how the hell do we find them?
He's selling hot cars.<eos> All right. Good.<eos> He's figured out the first part of the equation.<eos> All right, Eliot, give him the rest.<eos> Yeah, making the call now.<eos> Hello, officer?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I'd like to report some unsavory characters wandering around downtown.<eos> Yeah, I... they - they had tattoos, and I think they were wearing gang colors, and, uh... and I'm pretty sure they were speaking Spanish.<eos> Yeah, I-I saw them walking around down by Penzer's auto.
Assuming it is a bank. 'cause I don't know what you would be doing With one of these in a bank.<eos> It's the same one that Parker saw in Pieter's bag.<eos> A bar-code scanner.<eos> It scans a bar-code label And compares it to a remote database.<eos> But what are they doing with it?<eos> We still got the coffee guy in play.<eos> What's he up to?<eos> It's a lot of cops, man. Uh, maybe he's drugging them.<eos> Slows down response time.<eos> That's a good idea. He could have drugged them.
Now, there's no cell reception underground.<eos> The miners use a leaky feeder signal to communicate in the mine.<eos> But that's not compatible with our comms.<eos> I know. Quite the problem.<eos> You're wondering if I have an answer?<eos> I do.<eos> I created these UHF wireless nodes to couple with the leaky feeder, boost the signal,<eos> - And then we...<eos> - I know!<eos> I put them in the mine!
Think hard.<eos> What about Gale Bertram?<eos> No.<eos> Well, that's disappointing.<eos> I was sure....<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Can't win them all.<eos> That's it?<eos> Believe me, uh I know it's hard to deal with but, um, you know, sometimes the bad guys just get away.<eos> But you said you'd catch them.
Lynette!<eos> How are you this fine day?<eos> Who are these people?<eos> - Old friends.<eos> - Ex-con friends?<eos> Uh... aren't you jumping the gun?<eos> Until the homeowners association votes, you don't have approval for your project.<eos> These men have volunteered to get my halfway house ready.<eos> Most of them live in a dreadful facility on skid row.<eos> I told them that if they participated in the remodel, I could get them transferred here.
Just so you know, we got plenty of "Think about the children," and we need a lot more "Who let the cons out?"<eos> So, what exactly are we hoping to accomplish with all this?<eos> The mayor is in a close race for re-election.<eos> He needs every vote he can get.<eos> If we can make a big enough stink in front of the news cameras, maybe we can embarrass him into shutting that place down.<eos> So if this protest works, and the place doesn't open, what happens to all those ex-cons?<eos> What happens to them?<eos> I mean, I-if they don't get to stay here, where will they go?<eos> They'll just go back to where they came from, or some house in another neighborhood.<eos> But what if that neighborhood doesn't want them either?
Come on. Come on.<eos> We're gonna get started.<eos> You okay?<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's play cards.<eos> When I was 8, daddy left mama, and we were pretty much alone.<eos> Most of my friends were either stuffed or plastic.<eos> Of course, there were always mama's boyfriends, but as soon as I'd learn their names, mama would kick them out, and there'd be a new toothbrush in the bathroom.
Okay.<eos> Off you go.<eos> That... was really sweet.<eos> I know.<eos> Get me a nanny.<eos> What?<eos> I am drowning here.<eos> You heard what Penny said.<eos> I'm not myself anymore.<eos> And when I'm not taking it out on the kids, I'm taking advantage of them.
Everyone is staring.<eos> You should've seen the look on her face.<eos> Well, I couldn't see her, but I certainly heard her... and it was magnificent.<eos> Happy to help out. Bye, Bree.<eos> See ya in church.<eos> $9,000?<eos> Hey, my partners spent a lot of money printing those billboards.<eos> And they'll agree not to put them up, but they are not gonna eat the cost.<eos> Honey, I did the best I could.<eos> I talked them down from $12,000.
Not to me.<eos> It might.<eos> There are other considerations.<eos> So you can't get pregnant.<eos> Who cares?<eos> That doesn't bother you?<eos> We could adopt.<eos> So long as I get to teach someone how to throw a ball, I don't care whose DNA they got.<eos> Not only can I not have children...<eos> I don't want them.
I'm not taking her to the morgue.<eos> I don't want to show her to anybody.<eos> I'd prefer to do everything just with you.<eos> I don't want to be alone.<eos> Let's go right now.<eos> Please.<eos> Well, alright.<eos> And then I remembered about my buntings.<eos> I might not be home for three days.<eos> Who's going to feed them?
Yeah, baby.<eos> - My bags!<eos> - Yep.<eos> And they are in rainbow order.<eos> Oh, that is so obsessively compulsively wonderful.<eos> Oh, and one last thing.<eos> Here you go.<eos> What is this?<eos> My old clothes!<eos> My favorites. You didn't throw them out.
I know the pulse of this town keener than you ever will.<eos> You're like an infant criticizing how a war is fought.<eos> You got no clue.<eos> Everyone who's ever made any kind of history in this town Has sacrificed their principles briefly For a little bit of comfort.<eos> Because dealing with this city, Sometimes you need a little bit of comfort.<eos> It's the Memphis story.<eos> Can your wife back your alibi That she was with you the night Greg and Rachel were killed? Yes, she can...<eos> Before she heard that message and... Everything changed.<eos> Where'd you get those cuff links?<eos> Hilary gave them to me.
What? !<eos> No.<eos> Captain, please.<eos> Read him his rights.<eos> Get him to Holding.<eos> Hey, whoa-whoa! What the hell's going on?<eos> ! Wait a minute, okay?<eos> Look, Captain, this woman can identify the shooters at the liquor store holdup last night.<eos> I was there. These two men, they confessed to the murder this morning.<eos> Also confessed that your friend here hired them to kill his ex-wife's husband.
I am scared.<eos> No, I-it's not that.<eos> I'm scared because I never felt this way before.<eos> And I'm scared of losing you.<eos> Andie, I...<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I wish you would have told me about this place before I brought my family here.<eos> Before I brought my kids here.<eos> I-I watch them walk to school with the other kids, and I wonder, "what are they?
These green drops.<eos> Um, apparently, it works.<eos> Makes it safe for them to do, um... Whatever.<eos> Look... Forget about them.<eos> They're not like us.<eos> We are your real friends, and that is never going to change.<eos> Easy, Crezski.<eos> I can't keep running away.<eos> Man, sit down. You're in no shape...<eos> What's the point of having teeth if you never use them?
Previously on the Gates.<eos> So, what's up with you and Charlie?<eos> Is that really any of your business?<eos> Succubi paramour.<eos> I need the life force of others to survive.<eos> What happened to her parents?<eos> I met them.<eos> We socialized.<eos> And then I murdered them.
Things...<eos> Or people?<eos> A woman.<eos> But I know she's dead.<eos> Then it was probably her spirit you saw.<eos> a spirit.<eos> Sometimes after death, Spirits linger...<eos> In our world. Well, whatever it is It's following me.<eos> Everywhere.<eos> Well, salt in doorways has been known to keep them away, But the goal should be to help it move on.
Perfectly safe.<eos> I can assure you that we will do Whatever it takes to keep her that way.<eos> That's good.<eos> Well, Mr. And Mrs. Radcliff, You have got an extraordinary young girl on your hands.<eos> so bright and well-adjusted.<eos> And what an incredible imagination.<eos> Yes, she's, uh, she's quite creative, isn't she?<eos> Well, I just couldn't believe What goes on in that castle of hers.<eos> The search for the knight And the princess with the black stone. And her parents,<eos> What'd you call them?
So far, so bad.<eos> You girls up for a party tonight?<eos> A friend of mine's spinning at a house party in University Hill.<eos> No, we aren't up for a party.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Looking for strings.<eos> You know, since Kaylie seems to be your puppet master.<eos> Oh, please, stop, you are so funny.<eos> I noticed you two chatting up Austin.<eos> Do those promise rings lose their mystical powers when you take them off to work out?
Emily was caught with Austin Tucker after curfew.<eos> - That doesn't even sound like her.<eos> - Sorry I didn't tell you. But the girls trust me to keep their confidences.<eos> Now, I think it would be good if you left this gym for the remainder of practice.<eos> You're kicking me out of The Rock?<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Precise big toe.<eos> Precise little toe.<eos> Precise every toe in between.<eos> You need to think of the moves as you make them.
Listen, kid.<eos> This job is balls out or no balls at all.<eos> I sense you're not in that game, I'll pull you off myself, understand?<eos> Yes.<eos> Balls to the wall.<eos> Got it.<eos> Now get out of here.<eos> You still got his papers?<eos> I'm sure I do.<eos> Forgot where I put them.
This job is balls out or no balls at all.<eos> I sense you're not in that game, I'll pull you off myself, understand?<eos> Yes.<eos> Balls to the wall.<eos> Got it.<eos> Now get out of here.<eos> You still got his papers?<eos> I'm sure I do.<eos> Forgot where I put them.<eos> Where the hell did I put them, right over here?
He said not to tell anyone what I knew, then gave me the gun.<eos> And you started playing detective?<eos> Kent murdered someone I care about and I would do anything to make sure he pays.<eos> Look, he's been taking trips, okay?<eos> By himself, under the guise of business.<eos> - Eastern Europe, China, no one knows why.<eos> - You were trying to find out?<eos> I was trying to get into Kent's office.<eos> I've been seeing garbage bins coming out.<eos> He's been destroying documents... shredding them and then putting them in burn bags.
So we age it. Just like a painting.<eos> Get in the mind of the file.<eos> Live the life of the file.<eos> Hear the pulse of the file!<eos> Can we do this?<eos> Please.<eos> Step one... the case file is assembled by our clerk, Janice.<eos> She merges all the various reports...<eos> Probably over lunch.<eos> She logs in the police reports and staples them together.
'What makes part of one planet fly off and land on another?"<eos> Great question, Kristina.<eos> We've actually found meteorites here on Earth that are undeniably from Mars. There's about 50 of them known.<eos> Well, what we think happens is that asteroids occasionally slam into Mars and throw chunks of rock out into space, and Earth's gravity can also pull them in.<eos> So they land here and we find them, and in this way we can actually study pieces of Mars here on Earth.<eos> ASK THE UNIVERSE<eos> In 201 0, NASA announces that more advanced electron microscopy of ALH 84 001 reveals new details of iron oxide crystals called magnetite,<eos> a mineral within its own magnetic field that on Earth can be created by certain ocean-dwelling bacteria.<eos> Bacteria here on Earth have figured out how to grow magnetite crystals in their own bodies that help them to orient to the Earth's magnetic field, in order to help them swim in the ocean and orient while feeding.<eos> Are the crystals in ALH 84 001 fossilized magnetite created by Martian bacteria to help them hunt and feed in an ancient ocean when Mars still had its magnetic field more than 4 billion years ago?
Well, he's got a 9-millimeter.<eos> He doesn't need to.<eos> How about signs of forced entry to the car or the house?<eos> No. But Akron P.D. did find this.<eos> Handcuffs.<eos> So he restrains the men and saves the real savaging for the wife.<eos> Is this right?<eos> They found a used condom on both the husbands?<eos> And both had Viagra in their systems and neither had a prescription.<eos> So the unsub gives the men Viagra and then forces them to have sex before he kills them.
I mean, if they were facing forward, the unsub's back here down low, he pops up with his gun, there's no chance for them to fight back.<eos> He could have used a Slim Jim to get in.<eos> That wouldn't leave any marks. Yeah, but here's the real trick.<eos> How did he force two people to have sex at gunpoint?<eos> With Viagra, apparently.<eos> Viagra's a vasodilator.<eos> It takes at least 30 minutes to get the blood vessels to relax properly.<eos> I mean, Scott's fight or flight response would have kicked in.<eos> His heart's racing, his blood's flowing to all his extremities, but not the right one.<eos> Maybe he got them to relax.
How's he getting in?<eos> Could be a third-party vendor called in to install the lockers.<eos> And called back when someone loses their key.<eos> All right.<eos> Come back to the station. We'll work this up.<eos> Garcia, I need you to pull all the locksmiths that the gym contracts out to.<eos> Oh, that's gonna take some time.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm still gathering the vendors, and not all the websites list the trainers that work there.<eos> Of course I called them, did you call them?
They waited for her.<eos> A Sea of opportunity.<eos> Why was she drawn to those guys?<eos> - ***<eos> - Her friends at if she knew I never said that.<eos> She was only here a week.<eos> I think she trusted them.<eos> Why?<eos> She may have been testing her boundaries,but she's far too cautious to just go off with total strangers.<eos> So she met them before Friday night.
My three favorite words.<eos> Sleep.<eos> Uh, George...<eos> Look, both banks were hit within a 6-block radius<eos> George...<eos> I have isolated three more... in that area.<eos> George, I can't do this anymore.<eos> What are you talking about, man?<eos> Steph and I made a deal.<eos> We can't use our powers anymore until we understand them better. No.
Mayer was wrong.<eos> Roger wasn't unlucky.<eos> No, he was a bloody miracle.<eos> - You didn't eat those toadstools?<eos> - No. But riddle me this:<eos> How does a dead guy walk around town placing bets?<eos> Gambling's an addiction, but come on.<eos> A dead human walking?<eos> What, Fae zombies?<eos> The Chinese call them Hsien.
Well, let's swear you into the inner circle and find out.<eos> All right.<eos> Ask your questions.<eos> I only have one.<eos> Why did you steal $30,000 from your own safe?<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> I remind the witness that speaking a falsehood is punishable by death. So I'll ask you again.<eos> Why did you steal $30,000 from your own safe?<eos> I have my vices.<eos> I keep them under control.
Brother.<eos> Do you know what a woodpecker is?<eos> Sure.<eos> Do you know?<eos> I do.<eos> What is it?<eos> It knocks on the wood.<eos> Why does it knock on the wood?<eos> Because trees get sick and woodpecker is the tree doctor.<eos> Taking out the worms and eat them.
So when I discovered he destroyed a document detailing a mistake he made interpreting DNA results, Two things happened that day:<eos> trust became just another word and Serena Matthews' rapist went free.<eos> You had to make it public.<eos> It was a decision I don't regret making, and I'd make it again.<eos> Jo, my team does not sacrifice integrity for a desired result.<eos> Now that you're part of it, I promise you you'll never have to make that kind of decision again, okay?<eos> Hey. There are four companies in the city that manufacture the security laminate I found on the shards in the vic's bed.<eos> One of them installed the laminate for something called glassphemy.<eos> Oh, I read about that in the paper.<eos> It's an art installation where people get out their aggression by hurling bottles into a glass cage and the company collects the shards and recycles them.
Had so much going for him.<eos> He came home that night and we immediately knew something was wrong.<eos> Paul?<eos> Paul, what's wrong?<eos> Where's Sarah?<eos> What happened, Paul?<eos> Whatever it is, you can tell us.<eos> When he told us, all I could see was Sarah's face.<eos> And what she must have been going through.<eos> And her parents... we'd known them for years.
You don't usually work nights.<eos> Oh, when the exhibit closes, we have to process 200 items to be shipped out to 63 museums and private owners.<eos> They asked me to help out.<eos> Dr. Ipcress.<eos> You don't work nights.<eos> Oh, hi, Mr. Coswell.<eos> I didn't expect you down here so early.<eos> The gallery's closed because of a medical emergency.<eos> So, we have to process the exhibits right now.<eos> My men will scan the artifacts, tag them... green to be returned to their owners, red to stay here in the vault until collected.
You will never be able to prove who the guys were in the helicopters.<eos> Why?<eos> Because they don't have decals on their vehicles or their clothing.<eos> Because there's no record that they exist, No documentation, no evidence.<eos> What about you?<eos> You were part of them.<eos> You're evidence.<eos> I don't exist either.<eos> Why won't you tell me what you know?<eos> Why are you protecting them?
"Let it slide"?<eos> Till what, he kills an innocent person or someone's kid gets killed in the cross fire?<eos> He's dangerous.<eos> He has to be stopped right now.<eos> We can't let him run around...<eos> Yeah, fighting crime?<eos> George, this guy's not me.<eos> He's a vigilante.<eos> Which is a fancy-sounding word for what you do.<eos> Hey, I might be fighting crime, but at least I'm not committing them.
I texted lennox that I had a big surprise.<eos> Remember that green day concert that sold out in six minutes?<eos> Well, guess who scored two tickets.<eos> Floor seats?<eos> How did you swing that?<eos> What?<eos> I'm a city councilwoman, okay?<eos> I'm a very important person.<eos> All right, I'm a semi-important person.<eos> Fine, I won them on the radio.

What is it?<eos> A sobriety chip.<eos> He's been sober for two years.<eos> That's it.<eos> It must've fallen off when he got zapped.<eos> D.E.A. confirmed the theft.<eos> Said Dosher was robbed of some of his drugs last year, too.<eos> Kehoe wouldn't be wearing a sobriety chip while he was swimming if he wasn't actually sober.<eos> What if Kehoe wasn't using his meds?<eos> Maybe he sold them on the street like Dr. Meadows said.
Take home as many films as you like and watch them rent free.<eos> What about 1.50 an hour and 20p rental?<eos> 1.10 and 10p.<eos> 1.40 and 15?<eos> 1.10 and 10p.<eos> Well, then, you've got a deal.<eos> Good. There you go.<eos> I can't start now.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I've promised my mates I'd help them move into a flat round the corner.
I want the book.<eos> Tell me where it is, and maybe I won't kill you.<eos> I'd rather die than give you the book.<eos> If you think I'm going to betray my friends you don't know Curtis Weaver.<eos> I didn't learn much from my father, but I did learn this.<eos> When you're back's against the wall, you push back into their faces.<eos> You pull their teeth out. You put it where their eyes are.<eos> You take their ears and you box them.<eos> I didn't know what that meant, but I thought it was cool.<eos> You take them to the bank and then you take them to the cleaner with the money from the bank.
Well, that's not what I mean-- why would you want to bring a kid into this fucked up world?<eos> I agree. The earth is overpopulated as it is.<eos> Scientists predict that by 2035 we'll-- and it totally ruins your body.<eos> Cracked nipples.<eos> That sounds painful.<eos> If I wanted someone leeching off of me, I'd get a boyfriend.<eos> Babies are kind of like parasites, aren't they?<eos> Breathing your breath, eating your food, waiting to burst out of you at any moment.<eos> Although, I would adopt.<eos> No, babies are trouble just like the guys that give them to you.
Maybe we shouldn't have given him such an evil name.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Oh that's an interesting debate.<eos> Were we born or were we created?<eos> Uh, I'm pretty sure we're born, Hannah.<eos> I watched it happen like yesterday.<eos> I mean, is it nature? Shhh...<eos> Let them have this one.<eos> Those paramedics sure got here fast.<eos> I always see them parked up the street.
Okay, whatever, let's get him outta here before someone pisses on him.<eos> - Before someone else pisses on him.<eos> Okay, we need to figure out how Curtis got the book.<eos> Who's the last person to see him pre-statue?<eos> Well, I did see Curtis earlier today when he was normal walky, talky Curtis.<eos> What were you guys talking about?<eos> I'd love to tell you, but under guidance counselor student rules of confidentiality, I can't talk about it.<eos> But I can show you.<eos> Oh, this isn't right.<eos> These kids come to you for private guidance and you film them?
Right, let's just find Bailey.<eos> How's it hanging, Tiny?<eos> Sweet pictures, Tiny, seriously.<eos> How's your teenie weenie peenie?<eos> (student) You must need a magnifying glass to jerk off!<eos> Show us your baby dick!<eos> You know, it's not nice to bully someone, even if that someone is a bully.<eos> Bullies are people, too.<eos> We have feelings, you know?<eos> We just express them differently.
Don't worry, she's safe and sound.<eos> Safe and sound in our gullets! Ha ha ha!<eos> Prepare to die, you undead limeys!<eos> Let's be blunt.<eos> Yourkidsliveina society that glorifies acts of brutality and carnage.<eos> What should you, as parents, do?<eos> For the love of gosh, would someone please shut that door?<eos> Stop turning a blind eye to what's happening!<eos> The only solution, Is to cut your kids off from the outside world.<eos> Lock them inside their rooms and don't let them out until you drop them back off to the warmth and safety of this education facility!
Nice handcuff knots.<eos> - Better than his.<eos> - Who taught you that trick?<eos> My mother.<eos> Do you know what this maniac was going to do with me?<eos> Something to do with a ritual offering, blood rites, maybe human sacrifice.<eos> How many lives have been sacrificed already because of this evil thing?<eos> You must let me end this curse forever.<eos> I know who you are and why you are doing this.<eos> I can't imagine what it was like losing your parents when you were a boy but destroying another life will not bring them back.
That's a lot of credits.<eos> The interest alone could completely bankrupt the Republic.<eos> As it is, social services have suffered because of this war, education, infrastructure, health care.<eos> If we go deeper into debt, the basic needs of our people will evaporate.<eos> - This is good.<eos> - It is?<eos> Clearly taking out a loan on such obscene terms would essentially destroy the Republic, regardless of the outcome of the war.<eos> We only need to sway another handful of senators, as long as they don't buckle to the threats.<eos> What threats?<eos> Some members have received messages, warning them not to vote against the bill.
In the meantime, I'll pay another visit to those still undecided.<eos> I'll be parked just over there, my lady. Thank you.<eos> This way, uncle.<eos> What does ideology matter at this point?<eos> Is it worth being beaten to death?<eos> Look at what they did to you.<eos> These wounds will heal, but what about the millions who are dying in this war?<eos> Who?<eos> The clones?<eos> We created them for just that purpose.
We're testing their food.<eos> If we find something, perhaps we can create an antidote.<eos> But it will take some time.<eos> Which they may not have.<eos> What if it's not a poison?<eos> - It must be death watch.<eos> - I'm not so sure.<eos> In the past, the death watch attacks have only been directed at myself and the administration, not the children.<eos> They are terrorists.<eos> Perhaps the senator's visit has inspired them.
Tu es fuerte.<eos> Come on.<eos> (QUESTIONING IN SPANISH)<eos> We don't go with that man.<eos> I've seen several men go with that man and none come back.<eos> We've lost friends...<eos> We don't know what he does with them.<eos> I don't wanna talk about it anymore.<eos> I pick up day laborers and tell them that they'll get paid at 6:00 p.m.<eos> At 5:45, a certain I.N.S. Agent, by the name of Mose Schrute, throws them in the back of a van, drops them off in the middle of Harrisburg and tells them it's Canada.
Yeah, later.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's not here.<eos> Who?<eos> Trent, his brother.<eos> What about these guys?<eos> Is anybody here missing?<eos> Victor-- and Jeff Watts.<eos> He's Victor's right hand. Think they're together?<eos> They were the last time I saw them.
Are you with Claridge's? In a way.<eos> I've...<eos> I participated in some of their New York auctions. Yeah.<eos> - Participated how?<eos> - I'm a broker of merchandise, antiques mostly, for private collectors.<eos> I like to let them know when something, uh, you know, of interest, uh, becomes discovered.<eos> - Uh, you know...<eos> - Smuggling is a crime, Mr. Tom Jensen.<eos> No, I find the goods, I don't...<eos> I don't move them.
Hey, guys!<eos> These kids are at risk of what, becoming models?<eos> Mel, isn't it great the way that Lennox just loves to selflessly give back to the community?<eos> Sorry, we totally took over the kitchen.<eos> - We can just move this upstairs to my bedroom...<eos> - No no no! You sit.<eos> You stay right there.<eos> You don't move.<eos> Okay? We don't want you at risk too.<eos> Don't let them out of your sight.
What?<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> Behave yourself, Adam.<eos> - Say good-bye to your mommy, Adam.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry about this, everyone.<eos> Enjoy soccer camp.<eos> And don't... don't bully anybody and remember to hang up your clothes when you take them off.
You're back and with gifts.<eos> I noticed you were running a little low on supplies.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> You're a lifesaver.<eos> Last night, too.<eos> - Hope that didn't rock boat at home.<eos> I've been thinking about your setup here.<eos> And, I've got some contacts at surgery centers.<eos> So why don't you let me make some calls, see what I can work out for you?<eos> Most of them don't even have cars, none of them want to be part of a system that's failed them.
He... he looks better.<eos> No, not for long.<eos> I think he has a partial tear on one of his lungs, maybe other internal organs.<eos> Which... which means what?<eos> It means that he needs surgery.<eos> How soon?<eos> Now!<eos> Hey, Ang.<eos> Remember when we took the kids to Lake Winnipesaukee?<eos> You know, when we took them all fishing?
The Farcasses... standing in line doing nothing except wearing khakis.<eos> Bowl.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dr. Rick... surfing.<eos> That's gotta be a bowl.<eos> Mantle.<eos> All right. Great abs does not get you on the mantle.<eos> I'll give you the fridge, but that's it.<eos> Oh, how about this one? "Oh, look.<eos> We have dogs, and we dress them up."
You know, you could have just said something to us.<eos> Hello.<eos> Sabrina, right?<eos> Yeah. Oh, hey.<eos> Guy with the baby.<eos> It's Jimmy. My name is Jimmy.<eos> Am I crazy, or did this place get a little cowboy-ish since last week?<eos> New owner. Apparently, he thinks the customers will buy more food if the employees look like a bunch of jackasses.<eos> Hey, check it out.<eos> That crazy lady comes in here with a roll of "day-old" stickers and she puts them on the new bread so she doesn't have to pay full price.
Okay, first up.<eos> We ask a fundamental question.<eos> Alright.<eos> Where is Jasper?<eos> Next step, do research.<eos> Research.<eos> Yes. To construct a hypothesis which we then test.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well what exactly do we do, I mean physically?<eos> We publish our results and share them with the scientific community.
How do you know she's not running, Horatio?<eos> How do you know she's not somewhere right now, alone and afraid? Here's what we do.<eos> You turn yourself in, we focus on Elsa.<eos> This is the city that let her fall through the cracks to begin with.<eos> They took Elsa from her mother.<eos> Her mother was living with a cold-blooded killer, Memmo.<eos> They dumped my little girl into the system and they forgot about her.<eos> Why else would they leave her with a pathetic woman?<eos> They don't care, it's all about their damn spreadsheets.<eos> I'm gonna take those spreadsheets and I'm gonna hang them with them.
Your English teacher?<eos> Uh, are you sure?<eos> That's the thing.<eos> Olivia didn't exactly confess. In fact, she denied it.<eos> But you read her mind.<eos> This just isn't fair.<eos> I just wanted a job, not to get stuck in some after-school special.<eos> Oh, honey. You're right.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> And we didn't ask for these powers, but we've got them, so now we have to do what's right.
Can't tell if there was cyanide in this glass Or if it was just really bad wine.<eos> Either one will kill you.<eos> I could smell it on our victim 'cause it was in her lungs when she died, which aspirates during rigor.<eos> Okay. Bag and tag it.<eos> Got it.<eos> Stay.<eos> Take a deep breath.<eos> Is it that bad?<eos> See for yourself.<eos> I've seen the Internet stories and the pictures. Well, all of South Florida has already seen them.
Commissioner's on line three.<eos> I'll take it in the conference room.<eos> Hey, Carlos, check out a hunch for me.<eos> Found it. Just in case.<eos> You got lucky.<eos> I played the recording Chloe made of Stephanie Chapman for the Commissioner.<eos> Now, it's not enough to make hay in court, but it is enough to shut her down.<eos> The Chapmans have agreed to make a public statement.<eos> Ohh, that could be ugly.<eos> Well, not for these political animals. This won't even slow them down.
Yeah, it smells more Chinese now, doesn't it?<eos> Sort of sweet and sour.<eos> That's good, isn't it?<eos> Is that dead?<eos> That's dead, isn't it?<eos> Are they dead?<eos> Are they toads?<eos> So I don't get it. Are they alive in that bag?<eos> Why aren't they legging it?<eos> He's got like a Sainsbury's bag full of toads, he rips 'em out, cuts their head off, sticks them in another bin bag.
"Yeah,try everything out, do what the locals do," but there's no way I'm eating this stuff.<eos> This looks like they've got custard creams on a stick at the end.<eos> Just anything on a stick. Whatever you want on a stick.<eos> I just don't understand why they're eating all this.<eos> At home, restaurants would get closed down for having a cockroach in the kitchen.<eos> Yet here, it's a starter.<eos> I didn't think it'd be this mental, really, in the food department.<eos> There's a woman over there just tucking in on a... on just scorpions.<eos> Look at her, like she's just having a bit of chicken leg.<eos> Just shoving them in her face.
Paramedics got here first.<eos> His father was already headed to the hospital when the CSU arrived.<eos> Nothing else has been touched.<eos> Nothing like a little crime scene irony, huh?<eos> - Huh.<eos> - Where's Anthony's room?<eos> Oh, you mean the den of the cave bear?<eos> Whatever happened to "Playboy" centerfolds?<eos> Check out his comic books.<eos> Anthony drew them himself.
(rewinds video) I don't know.<eos> (Razik) Sure you do.<eos> You walked into that room. Your Dad was sitting there. Your mom looked up from her book and...<eos> Sounds like you told Anthony about his mom reading a book - before Anthony told you about it.<eos> - The book was lying next to her body. - It doesn't take a genius to figure out what happened.<eos> - Oh, so you found the book next to his mother's body and assumed she was reading?<eos> The defendant confirmed that in his confession.<eos> Or... Was he just parroting back what you had said to him?<eos> - He said it because it was true.<eos> - Were you aware that Mrs. Esposito couldn't read without her glasses... and that her glasses were found after the murders in her bedroom, that she did not have them with her in the living room?
I'm interested to know...<eos> That's exactly what we teach them, that humans evolved from apes and through natural selection we became humans.<eos> But her question is why are there still apes?<eos> I'll tell you why there are still apes.<eos> Firstly, we are not just evolved from apes, weareapes.<eos> And when animals evolve from other animals, it's not that they supersede them.<eos> It's not that we've evolved from chimpanzees.<eos> Chimpanzees and we have evolved from a shared ancestor who lived about six million years ago and who was neither a human nor a chimpanzee.<eos> 'There's a bigger point at stake here than evolution, of course.<eos> 'What's worrying is that a school that says it wants its pupils to be open-minded is, 'through its religious training, also guiding them to reject factual evidence 'at the very core of science and rational thought.
Listen.<eos> I dreamt about her...<eos> Bella...<eos> Same night we found drake.<eos> How many times you have that dream, Dwight?<eos> Dwight, I hear you.<eos> But please hear me when I tell you<eos> That I had a dream, too. I was myself, but I was also an eagle, And in my nest were five little eaglets,<eos> So I jumped. Miraculously, I could fly.<eos> I just swooped down, and I caught them in my beak,

Maybe just as an exercise, you should visualize that your prostate is cancer-free.<eos> You know I have an open mind to all these things.<eos> I'll try anything.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm gonna try.<eos> I'm gonna visualize three delusional things for myself... that I'm a successful writer, detective and college Professor.<eos> I like all those professions for you. Yeah.<eos> And what's good about all these jobs is you wear basically the same outfit... sport coats... so you save money.<eos> And I look good in them.<eos> Can I show you again how I took them all out?
Yeah.<eos> She kept texting me.<eos> Later she told me she tried to talk to Chip.<eos> What'd she say happened?<eos> Chip would never hurt anybody. All right.<eos> She's said enough.<eos> Her lawyer's not going to screw up the chance for hush money from Chip.<eos> So he was cheating. Big leap to murder.<eos> How about the deleted text messages from Kristin's phone?<eos> Tech Services just got them off the server.
- 500 bucks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Said carly and micah could work it off.<eos> You sold your kids to a predator.<eos> I love my kids.<eos> I got them work.<eos> Lots of kids have jobs.<eos> Mr. Holbart, you had other options.<eos> I begged child services to help.<eos> They dragged my kids away, crying and screaming, And split them up.
I begged child services to help.<eos> They dragged my kids away, crying and screaming, And split them up.<eos> And lizzie got her arm broken 'cause some other kid over there attacked her.<eos> There's predators in foster care too, detective.<eos> When you spoke with your daughter, Did she mention to you that she might be pregnant?<eos> No, she's-- she's too young!<eos> Why?<eos> Did she get abu--abused or something?<eos> Your daughter was starved, Beaten, and sexually assaulted.<eos> I sent-- I sent them away so they could have food And shelter,
Detective cruz, odafin tutuola, svu.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> Micah holbart.<eos> I've seen him around.<eos> No, you scooped him for pandering.<eos> He's 13. That makes him a victim.<eos> I'll let him know, next time I collar him For working a corner.<eos> These kids are sexually assaulted 24/7.<eos> You can't treat them like criminals.<eos> We match their photos to missing persons And send them home to the same screwed-up families That made them run in the first place.
An indonesian girl gets rescued here from the sex trade, She has access to counseling and to aid.<eos> But a pimp gets his claws into a kid from new york, She gets nothing.<eos> 14-year-old enslaved by a suburban family in minnesota.<eos> She cooked, she cleaned, slept in the closet.<eos> 12-year-old sold by her mother for five grand To a middle-aged man who shared her with his friends.<eos> Nine-year-old portland girl, Tossed to the street by her grandmother.<eos> This girl's pimp Charged a premium for prepubescence.<eos> For each one saved, there are eight more just like them.<eos> Can't really do much without funding for domestic victims.<eos> So what happens to micah's friends when we find them?
Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie<eos> Louie, Louie, Louie, Lou-ah Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie<eos> Louie, Louie, you're gonna cry Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie<eos> Okay, here's- - Here's the thing.<eos> I have two children and the thing that scares me the most is that they disappear.<eos> Nothing scares me more than them disappearing.<eos> That's every parent's worst fear.<eos> Now, why do kids disappear sometimes?<eos> I think it's because somebody took them and had sex with them and once you have sex with a kid, you gotta toss them because people hate folks who have sex with kids more than pretty much anything.
Hmm, always did bring your work home with you, but this takes the cake.<eos> Aw... Jess, thanks for doing this.<eos> Mm. Feels kind of nice, though, huh?<eos> Always did want to have our own little girl.<eos> Mm. Could you bring these to the kids?<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Did you move my boxing trophies?<eos> Oh, God, I'm sorry, I should have told you.<eos> But I boxed them up- there's so much clutter.
You are done.<eos> We've spoken to your superiors. We view Mr. Jane's actions as a breach of civil liberties.<eos> We'll pursue civil and criminal remedies. - Um--<eos> I'm curious.<eos> You couldn't hope to watch these videos for any length of time.<eos> What did you think you'd accomplish by coming here?<eos> Oh, we'll see the videos.<eos> Oh, you will see them, will you?<eos> And how is that?<eos> - You'll give them to us.
The dogs were happily playing.<eos> My uncle asked me if I wanted some water.<eos> I said, yes I do.<eos> And then he threw a bucket of water at me... and we all started to laugh.<eos> A militia trooper showed up and told us for the first time... that we had to leave... otherwise they would have come and take me away.<eos> My father was not at the farm, I was alone.<eos> My father washed the pigs and cleaned the stable.<eos> One day I entered the pig pen and started chasing them.<eos> At that point the pigs started running away... while I was after them.<eos> Then I pushed them around so that they all ended up... in a quagmire so they would get dirty all over again.

No, you don't mean that.<eos> I have magic, Merlin.<eos> Uther hates me and everyone like me.<eos> Why should I feel differently about him?<eos> You, of all people, could change Uther's mind.<eos> But using magic like this, will only harden his heart.<eos> You don't have magic, Merlin, how could you hope to understand?<eos> I do understand.<eos> Believe me.<eos> If I had your gifts, I would harness them for good.
They don't really like having a dispensary next door.<eos> Any of them dislike it more than others?<eos> I couldn't say, man.<eos> You know some kid stopped in yesterday and claimed there was a... Narc in a blue lowrider casing the place.<eos> But I don't know, man.<eos> Do you know how much was in the safe?<eos> Trevor handled the cash. I took care of dope and deliveries.<eos> Yeah, we'll need to see the books.<eos> Trevor's wife Deena's got the books.<eos> Uh, Trevor kept them at home to protect the customers.
And when the girl sobered up and realized what happened?<eos> Carlton's dad covered it up.<eos> Just like he did with the kid we beat up outside Paco-Paco's.<eos> Gray Campbell paid off the victim?<eos> It was just like the thing with Knight.<eos> We were in it together and...<eos> Things got out of control.<eos> If our only witness is an admitted rapist, our case just went from thin to translucent.<eos> Three dumb kids did not commit the perfect crime.<eos> SID couldn't find anything at Campbell's or Rudman's house to link them to Knight's murder.
This is Army Captain James Locke.<eos> He has an order to take custody of the defendants.<eos> On whose authority?<eos> Executive order from the Department of Defense, signed by Judge Roger Buso of the First Circuit.<eos> Your Honor, we were given no warning of this.<eos> We ask that you stay the order until we can file a motion.<eos> All due respect, this court doesn't have the authority to stay an order from a federal judge.<eos> He's right, Mr. Dekker.<eos> Much as I resent this high-handed intrusion by our friends in DC, I have no choice but to surrender the defendants.<eos> Yes, they are taking them right now.
Then what was it?<eos> Most people don't understand why anyone would choose to put their life on the line for strangers.<eos> It's a good question.<eos> I grew up in a military family and as a kid, I didn't get it either, but... one day when I was nine,<eos> We stopped at a crosswalk, and this car jumped the curb and hit her.<eos> Sent her flying and...<eos> I remember looking over at her laying there and thinking,<eos> "Why is she barefoot?"<eos> Then I looked down beside me, and there were her sandals.<eos> She'd been knocked right out of them.
- Tell me you're not serious.<eos> - They look alike.<eos> If the steward suspected anything, you would've been so surprised they would've thought it was an honest mistake.<eos> But they didn't.<eos> So my plan has worked perfectly.<eos> And they're off.<eos> Musketeer's Cat in the lead, Calm Thunder in second Temper's Twilight in third, and Papa Gene in fourth.<eos> - Sheba's Ghost is slow to get going.... - You meddling ass.<eos> I already switched the horses.<eos> You switched them back.
In time, scholars studied the patterns of eclipses long enough to predict them.<eos> The Babylonians discovered what's called the Saros cycle more than 22 centuries ago.<eos> The Saros cycle is a cycle of eclipses that repeat every 223 months, roughly every 1 8 years, and they're very similar to one another.<eos> The Greeks were aware of the Babylonian discovery, as we've learned from the remarkable Antikythera Mechanism,<eos> an ancient device found on a shipwreck under the Mediterranean Sea in 1 901 .<eos> The Antikythera Mechanism was first thought to be some sort of a clock and then some sort of celestial timer.<eos> It was a very complex mechanism with many gears and layers and planes.<eos> Archaeologists have been intrigued by the Antikythera Mechanism ever since it was found.<eos> Decades ago, they understood it was a mechanical computer for calculating movements of the planets, phases of the Moon, and other astronomical phenomena.<eos> But the latest discovery astounded them.
Found it, but really?<eos> It was originally used to seal battle wounds in the field.<eos> Alcohol swab and bandage tightly.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> What's really going on here?<eos> Sorry.<eos> You guys are supposed to be bank robbers, but you haven't even stolen any money yet.<eos> Your buddy's taking pictures of everyone's eyes with that scanner thing, and your ringleader just plugged my arm with glue. Who the hell are you people anyway--<eos> I scanned the rest of the hostages.<eos> Henry's going to call with the results as he gets them.
Magnus...<eos> If the source blood was destroyed during the self destruct, then chances are remnants of it could have seeped into the ground and attached themselves to the mineral content of the rock.<eos> Yeah, but why would that-- oh, no.<eos> Come on, seriously?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It would explain the size and aggression of the multipedes.<eos> And why they kept me prisoner instead of killing me.<eos> Same blood type.<eos> Remember what you said about territorial behavior?<eos> They seemed to get really mad when we locked them out of the lab.
Look, we need a new hot water tank. You want that, you've got to talk to Will.<eos> Oh, yeah, right.<eos> Have you seen him since he took over? He's running around here like his hair is on fire, which it very well could be, considering the amount of gel he... Uses...<eos> He's right behind me, isn't he?<eos> Henry, can you check on a missing shipment for me?<eos> We're supposed to take delivery of 12 crates of abnormals, but we're missing one.<eos> What was in it?<eos> According to the manifest, a colony 9f Cypher beetles.<eos> Oh, great, giant flying bugs.<eos> Yeah, well, they're in their dormant cycle, but we better find them before they wake up.
Oh, God!<eos> Please, don't drop me!<eos> The artifact you gave us.<eos> Where's the real one? I don't know what you're talking about!<eos> Face up or face down?<eos> No, no, no, please!<eos> It's in Hong Kong!<eos> I swear!<eos> What's it doing there?<eos> I-I sell pieces to collectors out of storage, replace them with fakes. I didn't think anyone would notice.
This fella looks serious. He's got sort of an intelligent kid's haircut.<eos> Ohhhh.<eos> Karl?<eos> Eh?<eos> I think they want you to pay for all the gifts you've been given. Can you get Aldo to tell these I haven't got any money?<eos> 'Cause it's a bit awkward, this.<eos> It doesn't translate.<eos> Anything.<eos> You have to give them back. All right.<eos> I'll give them back. But it's not 'cause I don't want them. It's because I just haven't got any money.
Oh, I don't know about that.<eos> What brings you to this neck of the woods?<eos> Head coach is a lonely job, And you are the closest thing on campus I have To an old friend.<eos> You need to talk?<eos> I need to talk.<eos> Wait, I don't understand. I thought that all of lancer's dirty laundry was aired Last year in the ncaa probe.<eos> Well, apparently, That didn't keep the boosters from wanting to pay the athletes.<eos> But why?<eos> They just don't think We can field competitive teams without pay-for-play.<eos> They think if the payments stop, We're going to lose players to schools that will pay them.
There have been too many deaths.<eos> We free them to save their lives.<eos> When starvation ends, they will still be "right-wing".<eos> What will happen then?<eos> The future is difficult to predict, we'll see along the way.<eos> Chief, look...<eos> Wei Shanghai's blanket and clothes have been stolen.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Forget it.<eos> They can swap them in the village for food.
Oh, I don't have a car.<eos> That's fine, you can just use Andre's.<eos> Oh, no, I mean...<eos> Perfect, done.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Thank you for my grown-up weekend. You look beautiful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you like my earrings? I do.<eos> When I dropped off Ellie, my mom just handed them over to me.
Hey, Taub.<eos> You didn't write up the AC system.<eos> Did you mention it to Kelly?<eos> No.<eos> You mentioned it to Chase?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whose idea was Legionnaires'?<eos> Dr. Chase's.<eos> Well, you get major points for trying to trick me.<eos> Unfortunately, you lose them all for failing.
Congratulations.<eos> You're a real leader.<eos> I am Felipe.<eos> Oh, you've got to be kidding.<eos> Dr. House was worried how you left things.<eos> He is giving you massage.<eos> As an admission he was wrong? Yes.<eos> Well, tell him thanks, but I have a meeting with Dr. Schatz in 20 minutes.<eos> He says you would say that, and to say, "No, you don't."<eos> Well, tell him he needs to stop canceling my appointments, because I will just reschedule them.
Tell Broda that I'm increasing his oxygen.<eos> And get my team down here.<eos> Hi.<eos> You're mad at us, aren't you? Yeah.<eos> Well, you have a right to be.<eos> We weren't honest.<eos> You might not know this yet, but sometimes adults mess up.<eos> Can I tell you something, and you keep it just between us?<eos> I'm not great with kids.<eos> I love them, but I get scared that I'm gonna do the wrong thing, and then... I usually do.
- Get out of here, vinny!<eos> - But I didn't say anything.<eos> Are you crazy, coming here?<eos> You said you didn't know her.<eos> And you told us he was just a homeless guy.<eos> Now he's "vinny"?<eos> Emma, you know this man?<eos> Yeah, they're accomplices.<eos> No.<eos> The professor here Provided the mushrooms, And emma tossed them in lindsay's salad.
You have to help her, free her.<eos> Remember how she treated you?<eos> Does she deserve what she has coming?<eos> It's true, she doesn't.<eos> Act fast, while he's napping.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> Go and then tell us everything.<eos> Okay, I will.<eos> Santi, look at me.<eos> Before you leave, I want the little boy to close his eyes... and the man to open them again.
Return the demon to the flames of Hell.<eos> What happens next exactly?<eos> Are things going okay?<eos> The ritual to control the demon has successfully begun, but time mustn't be wasted.<eos> We offer you the last souls as an offering.<eos> Let their blood be the river that joins us.<eos> Sacrificing the baby isn't essential, it's only a link.<eos> It facilitates protocol between worlds.<eos> It's like a cover letter to the Great Old Ones.<eos> To show our lords we worship and respect them.
It's just not possible.<eos> We'll have to search the place again is all.<eos> We must've missed her.<eos> First things first.<eos> Could somebody in the family have helped Abby escape?<eos> None of them have access to the security system, not even Pauline.<eos> What about your men?<eos> Are any of them vulnerabilities?<eos> They're ex-military and law enforcement.<eos> I handpicked them myself.
For you, just for being you.<eos> 'Cause I'm romantic like that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You see, your hands can be used for other things.<eos> And they're about to be.<eos> Ooh, yeah...<eos> I'd love to wrap this up before the game starts.<eos> Um, thank you for the flowers, babe, but I'm not sure you really understand this whole making-an-effort thing.<eos> I got you flowers.<eos> Yes, but the only reason you got them is to get sex.
Right there.<eos> Oh.<eos> Hey, Isabelle, you've got us both.<eos> Hi there, I've got good news.<eos> You've been approved for your line of credit.<eos> Yay!<eos> Isabelle, thank you so much for expediting this.<eos> We...<eos> We really appreciate it.<eos> If you both sign the documents and bring them into your branch today, we'll get you set up.
I want to know why you killed Panthro Torres and Lisa Brigosa.<eos> Taylor.<eos> Mac, I ran the print.<eos> Fernando Flores didn't do it.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I'm absolutely certain.<eos> We need to hit up every hideout, hangout and business front belonging to El Puño.<eos> The Devarro brothers have to be in one of them.<eos> I've got all available units scouring East Harlem.<eos> We'll let you know if we find them.
Okay.<eos> So?<eos> I haven't got all day.<eos> Well, sir, there's no easy way to bring this up...<eos> We're here to talk about what happened with Lennox and your son at the party. - Okay, one easy way.<eos> - Oh, the party issue!<eos> Yeah, I guess we can't dodge it.<eos> It's always tough when your own child is involved in something inappropriate.<eos> I feel for you, councilwoman.<eos> Because I know you took in those troubled kids - After their parents abandoned them.
"on this spot the most annoying person I knowas born"?<eos> For your information, I was born in the proud city of uijeongbu.<eos> Wee-jah-what?<eos> It's in korea, a little north of seoul.<eos> My dad was military, and I was born in an army hospital in uijeongbu.<eos> Okay, you were born in korea, you don't have any papers and you work for me.<eos> Oh my God. I have an undocumented korean nanny.<eos> As hard as this may be for you to believe, I'm not korean.<eos> And I have my documents, okay?<eos> I just don't have them.
Excuse me, did I hear the word...<eos> "Vigilante"?<eos> It was a theory I was keeping to myself, but...<eos> It's out there, but we may have a vigilante on our hands.<eos> I sent Masuka over to Tilden's to see if he could comb for... any evidence that a homicide had taken place.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Please don't.<eos> There are 13 DVDs... and only 12 victims. So I'm thinking... that one of the barrel girls escaped.<eos> And now she's after the men that abducted her.<eos> And she is hunting them, and she is killing them.
Clamp. - I need more irrigation in here now.<eos> - Right away.<eos> Dr. Bailey, what's wrong?<eos> He's perforated.<eos> I have to evacuate this abscess.<eos> Suction.<eos> - Can't you just use antibiotics?<eos> - If I want to risk losing him.<eos> He needs his worms back for his research.<eos> The suction will destroy them.
- I'll go.<eos> Promise.<eos> Come on.<eos> I said I'll go.<eos> No guilt trip, please.<eos> Biology says that we are who we are from birth, that our DNA is set in stone, unchangeable.<eos> There was a complication, but we were able to take care of it in surgery.<eos> You're gonna be fine as long as you quit the worms.<eos> I understand.<eos> The surgery destroyed them all.
This is stupid. No, it isn't.<eos> What's the worst that could happen, you kill him?<eos> Oh, ha ha, funny.<eos> Take the scalpel.<eos> Median... Sternotomy.<eos> Good.<eos> What happened next?<eos> Don't worry. I'm leaving the premises.<eos> We were in the back of the store.<eos> Dad had just given you two pennies, and you always hid them behind the counter in this big crack in the floorboards.

You're in Sitges?<eos> Yes, in Sitges. I am in Sitges.<eos> They are covered in blood.<eos> Help me!<eos> My God!<eos> Stay safe and talk to me.<eos> Do not disconnect.<eos> Try to describe what he saw.<eos> The children are dead.<eos> Someone killed them.
Dad, please help him!<eos> I'm trying!<eos> J.J., call 9-1-1.<eos> What was wrong with you, dad?<eos> I mean, why couldn't you get Mr. litchfield out of that car?<eos> I...<eos> I'm not sure, j.J. I mean, you've ripped our door off its hinges, like, three times by accident, and now you couldn't even budge the metal.<eos> Look, I'm not sure why, but something's happening with my powers.<eos> They're... inconsistent.<eos> What do you mean? Like... You're losing them?
I just wish that there was something I could do to help.<eos> I didn't need your help after all.<eos> All I had to do was read the Sushi chef's mind.<eos> Thanks, but I'm kinda in the middle of something right now.<eos> I mean, I did have to eat a lot of gross stuff, but it was so worth it.<eos> Bret's even more into me now. Cool, right?<eos> What a waste of your powers.<eos> You're manipulating some guy into liking you, and it's not even you you're getting him to like.<eos> Quit judging me. You've done way worse.<eos> Maybe so, but who knows how long these powers are gonna last, and if they were to somehow end today, you have to ask yourself, did you do the best you could with them while you had the chance?
Jim.<eos> J.J., what are you doing here?<eos> Exactly what you think.<eos> If you're not gonna help me, I'm gonna save his life by myself.<eos> Look, you can't, and even if you tried, you're not fast enough to tie the sutures.<eos> Either way, he is gonna die.<eos> At least this way I will have done something.<eos> Look, I know you feel badly, but this wasn't your fault.<eos> Maybe not, but if we just let him die, then it is our fault.<eos> I didn't ask for these powers, but I have them, and I couldn't live with myself knowing that I could've helped him and didn't.
No, no, I...<eos> I'd give 'em back.<eos> Mostly...<eos> I mean... maybe keep one or two.<eos> Know what happens to people that take things that don't belong to them, right?<eos> No. Other people are getting hurt.<eos> Doc!<eos> Come here, we got an ethical debate going on, and Adam is failing miserably.<eos> What do you do if you come across a fortune of precious gems that don't belong to you?<eos> I'd give them to the guy with the knife to my throat.
Heath... we gotta turn it in.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It was fun to dream, though, right?<eos> Wait, you don't blame him, right?<eos> 'Cause he wanted to keep it?<eos> I think he was very lucky that he had a girlfriend who pointed him in the right direction.<eos> Yeah, that direction got him killed.<eos> The men who stole those gems placed a tracking device on them.<eos> So they were probably tracking Heath's movements.<eos> The fact that he was bringing them to us didn't save his life, but it might've saved yours.
The bullet's deformed on both sides. Means it was tumbling when it hit Belson.<eos> Now, a flight of a bullet is nose first until it's made contact.<eos> Wouldn't tumble unless there was an intermediary target between it and the victim.<eos> Like a sandbag.<eos> Now, Belson had access to all of Carson's clients, his gun, security weaknesses...<eos> Best way to avoid suspicion is getting wounded in the robbery.<eos> Belson staged his own shooting.<eos> According to the surgeon who treated Belson, the bullet missed hitting any major organ, but it did graze the intestine.<eos> He must have checked himself out of the hospital right after Danny came to see him.<eos> Met up with the Kendricks brothers, killed them, then tracked Heath down.

We should position black-and-whites in the area. We might be able to spot the unsubs before their next hunt.<eos> Garcia should pull surveillance footage of gas stations, too.<eos> With all this driving, they have to be getting their fuel somewhere.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> What?<eos> These guys enjoy the thrill of the chase.<eos> I mean, all right, I'll buy that.<eos> But what I don't buy is them taking such a big risk.<eos> Well, they wouldn't let their victim loose unless they were certain she couldn't get away.<eos> So what would make them so certain?
This might be one of our unsubs.<eos> We said they'd eliminate the weakest link, and it looks like he was it.<eos> The pack isn't just breaking apart, they're completely collapsing.<eos> Rather than kill Stephanie Wilson, they decided to eliminate one of their own.<eos> I mean, how long until the lieutenant realizes that he's expendable as well?<eos> Hopefully soon. Stephanie may have gained another day, but that's not gonna last.<eos> We have another problem, that they've changed pattern also.<eos> Maybe they saw the patrol cars at the usual dumping grounds and got spooked.<eos> No, not a chance. My guys were parked at the edge of the field.<eos> No one saw them.
One where he doesn't feel inadequate or rejected.<eos> So he watches as long as he can. Yeah, but fire's unpredictable.<eos> Every second in here he's putting his own life at risk.<eos> And this guy's obviously confident that he can get out of here before it's too late.<eos> But there was a fire alarm.<eos> My men were here in 5 minutes. How?<eos> And he knew it.<eos> This unsub doesn't leave anything to chance.<eos> He knows exactly how long he's got with his victims.<eos> He probably knows response times or at least listens to them.
- It'll come off in a few weeks.<eos> - I figured.<eos> Does she still have her little mustache?<eos> You know, down at the Russian front.<eos> I wouldn't know what she's got.<eos> I was blindfolded and hog-tied.<eos> Right. Right, right.<eos> - Why are you wearing sunglasses?<eos> - No reason.<eos> Why don't you take them off?
Aren't you worried about getting arrested? Nah.<eos> I've been arrested lots of times.<eos> Chinese Democracy.<eos> You're a little bit crazy.<eos> Well, I'm usually crazy for a good cause.<eos> I can't just sit by while voiceless people or animals, or even buildings get screwed over.<eos> I'm certainly not going to just sit by while GNB turns The Arcadian into a soulless metal box. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Although I hear there's a lovely rooftop patio where folks can enjoy a nice bag lunch, so...<eos> Ted, I will find the bastards at GNB responsible for this, and I promise you, I will take them down.
- What's Libanese got to do with it?<eos> - He has.<eos> Libanese made the wrong decisions, and only if you make the right choice will you live and die a king.<eos> Remember that.<eos> - Mister Prosecutor?<eos> - The Gemitos have been released.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Forensics haven't sent the results of the paraffin test and we couldn't hold them any longer.<eos> The investigating magistrate has signed their release.<eos> They're handing them over to the gang.
No, not exactly.<eos> I had your taru tech morales dump the gps on camille's phone.<eos> It has her at a midtown macy's and a harlem target At the exact times of the first two attacks.<eos> Store computers back it up with debit card swipes.<eos> She's a hacker. She's a good one.<eos> Not to mention the men she allegedly attacked<eos> Couldn't I.D. Her.<eos> - Or wouldn't. - We still have her On criminal trespass at alexander gammon's.<eos> Whose lawyer says he doesn't want to press charges.<eos> Those men did something to make camille attack them.
And assuming it's the child you gave up for adoption?<eos> - A mother knows her child. - Well, we know<eos> One of these pricks is the father.<eos> If camille's telling the truth.<eos> That's easy to prove.<eos> We find the girl, we take her dna, And we match it to one of these creeps.<eos> Even if we could find her by opening the adoption records, Which are sealed, it wouldn't matter.<eos> Camille's daughter is scientific proof That she was raped.<eos> And the law says sorry, too late. The statute of limitations has expired.<eos> Okay, so how 'bout if we collar them for obstruction?
That she was raped?<eos> I have no choice. You gave me her confession on tape.<eos> So camille goes to prison For a posttraumatic reaction to being gang-raped, And those bastards are gonna walk away free?<eos> Before you get too weepy for the defendant, Bear in mind, she sodomized two men And seared their chest with a scorching coat hanger.<eos> You bear in mind that she was raped.<eos> Or is keeping your percentage up too important?<eos> You did your job.<eos> Now it's time to do mine.<eos> No matter how much it hurts.<eos> SUPREME COURT THURSDAY, OCTOBER 14 Yes, I branded them
The monkey has accepted the sacrifice. Oh!<eos> No, guys, get him off me! Aw!<eos> Happy adult Samhain.<eos> Garbage... garbage...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> That monkey really went to town on you.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happened to your pants?<eos> The monkey took off with them.
The Krays ordered the killing of Frank Mitchell.<eos> It wasn't a hard-and-fast rule.<eos> They killed Jack with their bare hands. I'm telling you!<eos> If Dukes didn't kill Slasher, he's not the copycat.<eos> The legend tells us that.<eos> Then, maybe Buchan's right, and this is all about revenge.<eos> But that means that...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> 28 members of the firm turned Queen's evidence at the trial.<eos> - Who'd want them all dead now?
He was trying to extract information.<eos> I told him nothing.<eos> You see, that's what men like Cenred will never understand.<eos> Camelot was built on trust and loyalty.<eos> It will never be defeated as long as we stay true to those ideals.<eos> Come in.<eos> What are they?<eos> Two silk dresses.<eos> In case your father asks any questions. Ah!<eos> Where did you get them from?
One sec. (Zipper snaps off)<eos> Great.<eos> Brent.<eos> Hello, Julianne.<eos> Obviously you're on your way out. I... Just want to give this to you.<eos> (Taken aback) Okay. Thanks.<eos> Do you wanna come in?<eos> Brent:<eos> Sure. Friedken handed in his final chapters.<eos> Frank Galvin read them and loved them.
Yeah.<eos> Okay, get that camera out of my face before I flip you like a cheese omelet.<eos> All you have to do is say "I care about making dreams come true."<eos> First of all, that line makes me sound like a hooker and saying it makes me feel like a hooker, so.<eos> Everyone is in this video.<eos> Randy's in the video.<eos> I don't want to brag, but in 29 takes, I only threw up thrice.<eos> Randy, did you send the Hermanson contracts downtown?<eos> I did.<eos> I sent them downtown.
I don't want to brag, but in 29 takes, I only threw up thrice.<eos> Randy, did you send the Hermanson contracts downtown?<eos> I did.<eos> I sent them downtown.<eos> Why are you saying it like that?<eos> They never arrived at the downtown office.<eos> They...<eos> Well, just to make sure we're on the same page, is "send them downtown"<eos> not an expression for shredding a document?<eos> You shredded them?

Yeah. I sent them downtown.
Johnny?<eos> Johnny!<eos> He and that little stuffed horsey raised all kinds of hell.<eos> But I have a simple method for shutting down troublemakers.<eos> You know that '98 Taurus that's always parked outside?<eos> The one with the really annoying alarm?<eos> We're familiar with it.<eos> Well, when a kid like Johnny acts up in my class...<eos> Shuts them right up.<eos> Lily, my students are adults, and I treat them that way.
What's all that?<eos> Our technical analyst ran background checks on the suspects.<eos> Oh, I could have given you that.<eos> We typically gather our own intelligence.<eos> Out federal databases tend to have more detailed information.<eos> Well, how do you know they're more detailed if you haven't seen ours?<eos> It's nothing personal, chief.<eos> It's just, you could have asked.<eos> Next time I will.<eos> Has anyone vetted them?
No, kiddo...<eos> There's no winning.<eos> There's just... Living.<eos> Moving forward.<eos> And if you keep doing that... You'll be all right.<eos> Is that true?<eos> It is for me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> "Children begin by loving their parents.<eos> "As they grow older, they judge them.

I was studying to be a dancer.<eos> One night, a bunch of us went out for pizza and beer.<eos> My reward...<eos> If I danced well.<eos> The drinking was a mistake.<eos> I must have been stumbling as I crossed the quad, Because three boys appeared And offered to help me back to my room.<eos> The next thing I remember, I woke up... To these boys...<eos> Seemed to go on... Forever.<eos> When they were done, They force-fed me pills So that it would look like I had overdosed.<eos> Police never caught them.
Those officers said I had to talk to svu.<eos> - So what the hell did I do?<eos> - Raped and murdered the girl That you dropped off at the laundry this morning.<eos> You've got the wrong guy.<eos> Let's talk about it at the precinct.<eos> Wait.<eos> W-was she in the load from mercy?<eos> Oh, funny that you would know that.<eos> Listen, all I did there was sign off on three carts.<eos> The guy rolled them out for me while I hit the head.
Indeed he does.<eos> Miranda pond.<eos> I didn't know you worked for bottom-feeders.<eos> My client will only talk in exchange for immunity On samantha millerton.<eos> A free pass on a vicious rape and murder?<eos> Forget it.<eos> Then forget knowing the whole story.<eos> It's a pity, really.<eos> Those poor victims, their stories never being told.<eos> Gambel tells us everything about those trophies And who collected them...
She has dark hair, she's tall, she's thin.<eos> Lots of rapists have a type.<eos> The possibility that joe hollister Is both your father and vivian's is so remote.<eos> We couldn't identify one of the trophies.<eos> It was a handkerchief.<eos> My mother always carried one.<eos> what if it's hers?<eos> I wish that you'd come and talked to me Right after the shooting.<eos> -I'm not imagining these details.<eos> -Maybe so, but you're associating them in ways That aren't rational.
Mike, I really have to go home.<eos> Are you sure you can't stay a little bit longer?<eos> I've been here for almost two days.<eos> I don't have any clean clothes to wear.<eos> I don't know how they got dirty.<eos> We hardly used them.
You have to come with us.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> This is not 1943.<eos> He's a warrior, Stark.<eos> He will not yield.<eos> You've got that right, buddy.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry, but I need you to listen.<eos> My apologies, miss. This solider doesn't listen to HYDRA agents.<eos> He just takes them down.
As I promised, my darling.<eos> Chapter Two SUBSTITUTES<eos> One... two... three!<eos> I want to see a dead person.<eos> I want to see what a grown-up who drowned looks like.<eos> Know what?<eos> It was supposed to be a didgeridoo.<eos> -Be careful with the flowers.<eos> -I'm doing my best.<eos> Even the tooth fairy sees them more often.
Hey, hold on, wait for me.<eos> Here's one.<eos> Ana!<eos> Ana, let's go!<eos> Ok.<eos> Ralph Ellison said, "I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me."<eos> Guys, I started a geographic profile on the assumption that the Appalachian Trail is this unsub's hunting ground.<eos> We got lucky with Daniel.<eos> I doubt we'll find any more bodies.<eos> Parents think their kids are lost, but what's worse, he has them.
Robert...<eos> Robert!<eos> This unsub hunts for, abducts, and keeps his victims in the woods.<eos> We believe he left civilization and forged a home for himself right here in the wilderness.<eos> Which means he's lost any societal or moral restraints.<eos> He's devoted his life to taking children, and he's found the perfect place to hide them.<eos> He's found or made a shelter which is difficult to find.<eos> It allows him to withstand harsh weather and is secure enough to keep his victims from escaping.<eos> So it must be sizable, underground or on a mountainside.<eos> Sometimes the voices of trapped children gets drowned out by search parties calling for them.
What is that, spray paint?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Those little punks want a war.<eos> And now they've got one.<eos> Hey, here's someone who might understand how you feel.<eos> Hey, how you doing.<eos> First day being pink? Yeah.<eos> Welcome to hell.<eos> All right, Brian, we're getting my candy back, and here's how it's gonna go down:<eos> First, we track down those teenage hoodlums and kill them all.
We're good to go. Now, fellas, don't get greedy.<eos> Only take the first 50 million.<eos> Any visual on Chaos?<eos> No sign of entry.<eos> No roof access.<eos> They must have gone in underneath. No.<eos> Tunneling's too risky. It would have taken months.<eos> Unless the tunnel was already there.<eos> Back in the '60s, pedestrian tunnels were sort of the wave of the future.<eos> The mob made a fortune on the contracts until the state shut them down.
No,just saw two guys in a lot. One of 'em had a gun.<eos> He was trying to shove the other guy into the trunk of his car.<eos> Can you describe him?<eos> The guy with the gun had a sweatshirt with the hood up.<eos> And the other guy was smaller,in a suit<eos> - Nononoreally a suit,but like a vest.<eos> Your name?<eos> I'm Sherry Winger. I heard the shots.<eos> But you didn't see anything?<eos> I just heard them while driving by,but about a minute later,a car booked past me going about 100.
- Ed.<eos> - All right. But no saying "yee-haw" and no calling your friends while it's happening.<eos> - There's my boy.<eos> - Hey, dad.<eos> Oh, how's my favorite fella?<eos> I just--<eos> I missed you, sweetheart.<eos> How are you?<eos> And vince made these cabinets by hand.<eos> Assembled- - I assembled them by hand...
Hello? Dirk!<eos> Dirk, it's Richard!<eos> No, look, I've changed my mind about investing in the agency.<eos> I want my money back.<eos> I'm afraid that won't be possible, on account that the money is no longer in my possession.<eos> What, none of it? What...?<eos> Expenses?<eos> What expenses?<eos> A most intriguing case, Macduff.<eos> I have plotted and triangulated the vectors of all the various events and occurrences and traced them to a five-star hotel in Barbados!
I will, father!<eos> No more running away for Mint Berry Crunch!<eos> Hello Cthulhu, I heard you haven't been berry nice.<eos> Not enough huh?<eos> Maybe the intense flavor of Mint will freshen things up!<eos> I reach the Gulf of Mexico in no time!<eos> And with all my strength, I drag Cthulhu back to the depths from whence he came!<eos> My trusty hero companions are there!<eos> Still alive!<eos> I return them to their world encased in a protective berry bubble!
You want us to file a report?<eos> We might find it. If you're going to play detective, I'd prefer you find my car.<eos> Which was stolen a year ago and the reason I'm riding a bicycle in the first place.<eos> We'll have two breakfast specials.<eos> You'll have whatever I bring you and you'll like it.<eos> Yes, we will.<eos> So why did Molly buy you those boots anyway?<eos> - You have an anniversary?<eos> - No, that's the beauty of it.<eos> She bought them just because she was thinking about me.
Guess it was stupid of me to introduce her as my friend.<eos> Man, you were looking up at stupid with a telescope.<eos> - But your instincts were correct.<eos> - How so?<eos> It's not in a man's nature to settle down with one woman.<eos> We're to propagate with multiple partners like they do in the animal kingdom.<eos> What about swans?<eos> I heard they mate for life.<eos> Who can confirm that?<eos> I mean, is there some guy following them around all day long?
Where did you used to go?<eos> Wales. Porthmadog. Year after year after year.<eos> It was brilliant. And why was it so great?<eos> It's everything you want.<eos> It's a good, like, you know...<eos> it was a good holiday park.<eos> Right.<eos> Weather was good. I had loads of mates. There were always kids knocking about or got on with.<eos> Arcade, beach. There was hells angels down one end.<eos> And I remember watching them, thinking, "I want to be one of them."
More weight.<eos> That should be easy for you, right?<eos> You got that extra pint of blood pumping through your veins.<eos> Give you that big boost.<eos> Is this about the doping?<eos> No, it's about jacking an armored car and shooting three people.<eos> Your fingerprints, they're on a blood bag at a doctor's office.<eos> Look, my girlfriend does housekeeping for that building.<eos> Dr. Kinkirk travels a lot, so I use the office sometimes to supply doping equipment to the triathletes.<eos> Help them draw blood.
I actually wanted to talk to you.<eos> To me? Okay.<eos> Well, how may I help you?<eos> Besides encouraging you to avoid stripes.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> She just read my mind, right? Uh...<eos> If you are in here, those jeans are super cute.<eos> I actually wanted to talk about boys.<eos> Okay. Um...<eos> I've had a hard time figuring them out lately... right.
Everything go all right?<eos> They're fresh.<eos> No, uh, I just used the time that you gave me yesterday to help my son with his homework.<eos> Oh, man, look at that... a hero and a family man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I was just helping him with his research project on the local transit system, and, um, he asked me if any of the trains had ever been robbed before, and I said if anyone would know that, it would be you. Well, yeah.<eos> I mean, a few years back, some guys hit the Pacific bay transit authority's money train.<eos> What's a... It's like an armored car, but, you know, a train, and it transports the city's cash intake to central deposit downtown.<eos> Well, how did the robbers gain access?<eos> They dressed like conductors. They smuggled their weapons into transit authority duffels, and nobody even gave them a second look. Wow.
Yes, it did.<eos> And would you say that resulted in unsafe conditions that were responsible for Troy Whitten's death?<eos> Regrettably, yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No further questions, your honor.<eos> Construction work is dangerous.<eos> And the kind done in this town, the height, the scale all the things that make Vegas Vegas makes it even more dangerous.<eos> So you would think that we would have the best safety standards going, but instead, we have the highest construction fatality rate in any city of this size in the country.<eos> And today we've learned why.<eos> A commission that demands builders get buildings up fast, a corrupt official who then shakes them down, threatens to slow them down or shut them down.
Nothing so clear, or so pleasing.<eos> But I have seen something in Mr Farmer.<eos> Lady Sarah.<eos> My lord.<eos> Mr Southouse.<eos> You both might do well to attend to Mr Garrow.<eos> I believe he's in need of reassurance.<eos> What kind of... foul swamp is this in which I must live and make my living?<eos> I cannot decipher which half of it is worse... ..the endless... ..monstrous crimes of men... ..or the many barbarous ways by which we punish them.<eos> For little more than the theft of a penny, we... flog, brand, burn, maim and jail them, or dispatch them to Godforsaken lands.
I am in need of a compulsory.<eos> The particulars I have here in order for Mr Garrow to...<eos> Mr Southouse, I cannot jump every time Mr Garrow demands my help to compel a witness to attend and testify.<eos> Tell the court, what are you?<eos> I am maid to Lady Sarah Hill.<eos> You will tell me now of the events of the 16th of the month gone, relating to Lady Sarah at the Royal Hotel.<eos> On the 16th, instructed by Sir Arthur, you took fresh clothing to your mistress, did you not?<eos> Mary.<eos> Your answers here will neither save nor condemn your mistress.<eos> It is the events that will weigh for or against this man, and not your telling of them.
'Eddie was spot on.<eos> I just had to make her to dump me.<eos> Simple, right?<eos> 'But I had to do it in a public place.<eos> 'Somewhere where she wouldn't be able to go crazy.'<eos> So why are we in a library, Don?<eos> Oh, I want Brian and Sam to see I like reading.<eos> Are you gonna read all those books?<eos> God, no!<eos> Just carry them round. Make them think I like reading.
Piss off, you pathetic jobsworth.<eos> You're nothing to me, you hear?<eos> Nothing!<eos> Psst. Dontom.<eos> Over here.<eos> I like the way you handled that guy. You're brave.<eos> Would you speak to one of my clients?<eos> Oh, I wasn't actually speaking to...<eos> You see, he agreed to take three projects from us but now he's stalling.<eos> If Karen finds out I haven't secured them, it'll be "Adios, Senor Fairdog", you know what I mean?
Jake Harris is dead.<eos> We found his body at the Akahai.<eos> His father was an old friend.<eos> I've been working at the firm for over 20 years as an in-house investigator.<eos> Jake was like family.<eos> Nancy asked me to help.<eos> Nancy Harris, Jake's mother?<eos> After they got engaged, she had me run a background check on Erica.<eos> Then the kids took off and she sent me to find them.<eos> How long were you tailing them?

If he can have Arthur followed...<eos> Then Arthur will lead us all the way to the cup itself.<eos> Which way was the Prince heading?<eos> For the Forest of Ascetir, my lady.<eos> Send word to the scouts in the area.<eos> They must be prepared.<eos> Yes, Sire.<eos> Can your scouts be relied upon?<eos> Of course.<eos> I hand-picked them myself.
You know... The last time I saw legs like that, They were curled up under dorothy's house.<eos> Good one, sir.<eos> Now, if you'll please excuse me, I have more good cheer to spread.<eos> By letting everyone make fun of you?<eos> Here, I'll help.<eos> Check this out.<eos> These days, even the north pole is outsourcing.<eos> He's indian.<eos> [bells jingling] Are we hearing these bells, people?<eos> So originally, the coupons were for my fiancee, Then russell-- who shall remain nameless-- Gave them out.
You have the right to an attorney.<eos> Okay. Tawny, Tanya and Tammy, Lloyd will see you now.<eos> I like your top.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Got drunk and got married last night.<eos> I already got a wife in Milwaukee.<eos> Oh, I can't... Shouldn't look at that.<eos> Woke up with this damn ring on my finger. And the gal telling me she's got three kids. She's getting a lawyer, and I gotta pay child support.<eos> I haven't even met them.

OK, but I'm not like all the crazy people you see in here.<eos> I'm not going to start flinging my bum rubbish at the walls.<eos> OK, well, I never knew my mother.<eos> She died during childbirth.<eos> And your father?<eos> He also died.<eos> During childbirth.<eos> So, you never knew your parents?<eos> SOBBING: No, I didn't!<eos> Ah, Jesus Christ! I never knew them.
Oh, just wear your glasses.<eos> It's bad for your eyes to strain.<eos> I think glasses look very elegant on an older woman.<eos> Older woman?<eos> A mature lady. A woman of your age.<eos> And what age would that be?<eos> Oh, um... Scared!<eos> Six...<eos> Fifty-ni... eigh... sev...fifty-si...fou... 49? Very elegant.<eos> As long as you don't wear them on a chain, cos that can make you look very old.
Tegan.<eos> Really old, like... 156 million years, Miss.<eos> Good guess, Tegan... but it's much, much older.<eos> It's 4.6 billion years old.<eos> So if you think that human life has been around for about 200,000 years, and we live to be, say, 75 years of age, well, that's not much, is it, compared to the age of the solar system?<eos> If it's on answer, I'll kill him.<eos> 'Hi, it's Rob...<eos> leave a message.'<eos> Siobhan's eating your sandwiches.<eos> What's the point of making them if you're always going to leave them?
She'd be a fool to say no.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Hey, can either of you use me today?<eos> I'm supposed to be with Stark,<eos> - but he wants to work with someone else.<eos> - The guy's an ass. - Maybe heartlessness is a peds thing.<eos> No offense, but your girlfriend leaving town really screwed me.<eos> - I mean, I'm happy for the children of Malawi and all...<eos> - Yeah, no, you should be worried for them.<eos> Right now she's making them fall in love with her.
Why don't you ponder that for a while... quietly?<eos> Wow.<eos> That's deep.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, I pondered it, but the thing is, is I don't agree with the basic premise.<eos> Okay, assuming a lake has fish in it, which this lake does, and assuming that you're using the right baits and res, which we are, you should be able to predict getting more bites than, um,<eos> like none an hour.<eos> You know...<eos> Which leads me to believe that the fish are elsewhere, like... like over there, or over there, or over there.<eos> Right, and if you were over there, you would scare them away with your incessant chatter.
Personally, I would like everything in one car.<eos> Something that's good on the freeway and great on the racetrack, something with five seats, a real trunk, and, ideally, it wouldn't cost an arm and a leg.<eos> Well, you're very selfish.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> It may sound impossible, but I'm not so sure.<eos> The Sierra Nevada mountains, California.<eos> In winter, this frozen wilderness is entombed in ice.<eos> But when spring brings a thaw, deep in the forest, a beast stirs.<eos> This is the Mitsubishi lancer evolution.<eos> It's what happens when you take engineers, lock them in a room, and say, "here's your coffee.
Serves me right for playing such a stupid game as golf.<eos> But no, I've been in agony.<eos> I'm actually on painkillers right now, so...<eos> No, it's true.<eos> If I suddenly start talking like Paula Abdul, you'll know why.<eos> I'm not drunk.<eos> So when the doctor...<eos> This is true.<eos> When the doctor gave me the painkillers, he said, "Now, you can't drink alcohol with these."<eos> And I went, "I don't want them then."
First-class passengers please make your way to gangplank A. Gangplank A, please.<eos> I'm sorry, Hallam, I had to go back for my flowers.<eos> - Do you really need them?<eos> - They were a gift!<eos> From the Foreign Secretary.<eos> I'm going to display them in our suite at the Dorchester.
- That's about fucking time.<eos> - Sorry. Just wait.<eos> There's quite a turnout.<eos> Shit, my mom's here, and my dad.<eos> - I didn't know you had a dad.<eos> - Front row, to the left.<eos> The guy holding that very young girl?<eos> He thinks Russian brides is like the Book-of-the-month club.<eos> He just sends back the ones he doesn't want.<eos> Rings, did you remember them?
- She's against it.<eos> We argued, she stormed out of the room and left me standing there by myself in the house I used to own.<eos> Anyway, before I left, I figured I'd pee.<eos> I didn't really need to, but, you got to figure with the traffic,<eos> - it's a good defensiv... - Would you please get to it!<eos> Almost there, almost there.<eos> So, as I was walking down the hallway, I noticed that Judith's bedroom door was open, and...<eos> I thought about those beautiful diamond earrings just sitting there in her jewelry box and... how I can't even afford to buy my girlfriend a birthday present.<eos> Let me guess. You peed in her jewelry box.<eos> Judith never even wore them, Charlie.
What you need is a good massage.<eos> There's this auld one I went to last week, lovely little Chinese bird up the road.<eos> Gives you a rub and tug. Unbelievable!<eos> She's about 60 but the heat from her hands, it's from doing that Tai Chi.<eos> She lets you have a kip there afterwards as well.<eos> Elmo, man, you're hilarious.<eos> Seriously, man, you should go.<eos> Here, Elmo, how would you like to make some money?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Get your teeth fixed up for you as well, get them capped and whitened.
How the fuck did that happen?<eos> - How did it happen?<eos> - It's quite simple. You bought three properties that have brought in no income. And you've ignored our letters for the last six months.<eos> No, no, I'm no good with numbers.<eos> Can't I have an extension, or pay by instalments? Can't I?<eos> We offered you that opportunity, but you ignored that too.<eos> It's too late now, Mr. Fabiani.<eos> Either you pay off the debt within 3 months, or we'll take the property.<eos> Nercio and Botola.<eos> Why them? Because they never come back empty-handed.
So what can you do?<eos> Anyone who touches me, they want to shag me.<eos> Super-horny or something.<eos> I can see how that would be a problem.<eos> How much do you want for it?<eos> I don't want anything, I just want it gone.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> You won't use it on anyone, will you?<eos> I can't use the powers while I'm holding them.
We had sex this morning, then she cooked me breakfast.<eos> And now she's gonna take care of my kid all day.<eos> How's Jenny?<eos> What's she focused on these days? Bye!<eos> Smartass Kermit.<eos> - So miserable.<eos> - Look at him over there, look at that guy.<eos> What is he doing over there, by the way?<eos> He's asking these guys about Breaston versus Brown.<eos> He still wants to know, he's polling them.
Sorry mate, off duty.<eos> 221 B Baker Street.<eos> I'm not on duty mate, you see the light?<eos> Just round the corner, it's Baker Street!<eos> There's plenty of other cabs round here.<eos> Get another cab.<eos> 221 B!<eos> I'm not on duty and I don't do drunks!<eos> Hello?<eos> How do you make them take the poison?
There's plenty of other cabs round here.<eos> Get another cab.<eos> 221 B!<eos> I'm not on duty and I don't do drunks!<eos> Hello?<eos> How do you make them take the poison?<eos> What?<eos> What did you...<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said, how do you make them take the poison?
Do it now<eos> He is a just fan.<eos> We can't change him now.<eos> Did you see this?<eos> Look at those muscles!<eos> There is only a fine line between a fan and a stalker.<eos> Let your guard down and they'll walk all over you<eos> It's your fans that keep you on your job.<eos> Make sure you get that to the new girl as well.<eos> The minute you let them take control, it's over.
And, one of them has a injury on the neck.<eos> I see.<eos> As an avid listener... What's your most...?<eos> Wait!<eos> You said earlier. Parting could be a way to preserve love eternally.<eos> That's not what I meant...<eos> If my rabbits vanish one day. then, I'll be able to keep their loving memories.<eos> No, actually...<eos> So, I... Found the two rabbits that got away.<eos> And killed them.
I think he was motivated by Sun-young's program.<eos> The dates of the murders coincide with the program schedule.<eos> Travis from "Taxi Driver", drives his taxi every night through the decadent streets of New York.<eos> 'Someday a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets '<eos> Why do get such satisfaction from watching our heroes in the movie<eos> Because in reality, no-one takes care of the wrongs we come across everyday<eos> Where is my hero right now?<eos> Are you listening to me?<eos> Heroes sometimes suffer at the weight of their fate.<eos> But, it's that suffering makes them stronger.
Ask out a busy man to sit down for dinner?<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Prosecutor<eos> I thought I'd lighten up your mood<eos> You're calling me Mr. Prosecutor<eos> Why don't you just call me by first name, motherfucker!<eos> There's been a misunderstanding<eos> What misunderstanding?<eos> I became a laughing stock My job is on the line<eos> Mr. Prosecutor, forgive me for what I did<eos> If I had mistakenly caused you trouble please be generous as to forget them
I've been searching for this for ten years.<eos> These are written in Tangut script.<eos> A rough translation would read:<eos> Authorized to capture traitors, dead or alive.<eos> That's not the point however.<eos> What's really interesting... is what the bandit Hu Shuanzi wrote on the back.<eos> This is from a newspaper article from 1931.<eos> After Hu Shuanzi looted the Tangut imperial tombs, he was surrounded by Nationalist troops and never heard from again.<eos> They never found any of his treasures.<eos> Hu the Bandit hid them somewhere.
I can't believe this!<eos> Stop right there young lady!<eos> How dare she!<eos> Mom, you've kept it from Dad all that time. He really had no idea.<eos> He even flipped the table over.<eos> It must've made you dizzy, on an empty stomach and all.<eos> Mom, I'm going to be a real chef.<eos> Hello. I'm Oh Sae Young from Table of Chef.<eos> The weather's gotten cold lately, hasn't it?<eos> When our children come home with their noses and hands icy, what can be more welcoming than a warm, roasted sweet potato gratin waiting for them?
He's so handsome.<eos> I feel like I'm going to melt at the sound of his voice.<eos> Come to your senses, you foolish girl.<eos> This is your office.<eos> If you need anything, just let me know.<eos> As far as the kitchen goes, I must not have interference even from you.<eos> It is the sole domain of the Chef.<eos> Of course.<eos> How did you find the kitchen staff?<eos> They've worked together for quite a while so I'm sure you will find them very useful.
It'll be a better idea to work harder in becoming better with the people who just think you're lacking.<eos> Trying to get along with those who know you're not ordinary will be more tiring.<eos> Hey, let's go drink a cup of cold beer.<eos> No, I accepted Mi Ho's present. I need get a present in return. I'm going to buy beef ribs on the way home.<eos> Not flowers, but flower cut beef?<eos> Our Mi Ho is different.<eos> She doesn't like flowers, she likes beef ribs.<eos> Did Mi Ho say she hates flowers?<eos> Oh...<eos> Hates them?
Hey, let's go drink a cup of cold beer.<eos> No, I accepted Mi Ho's present. I need get a present in return. I'm going to buy beef ribs on the way home.<eos> Not flowers, but flower cut beef?<eos> Our Mi Ho is different.<eos> She doesn't like flowers, she likes beef ribs.<eos> Did Mi Ho say she hates flowers?<eos> Oh...<eos> Hates them?<eos> I never asked her.<eos> She probably hates them.
Why are you home at this hour?<eos> Did you get fired again?<eos> Grandpa!<eos> Grandpa!<eos> We missed you very much!<eos> Have you eaten?<eos> Where did you eat?<eos> I just looked around for food somehow.<eos> Our parents are dead.<eos> So we won't see them anymore.
I know it hurts, but I had to make a point with you.<eos> That ain't what's pissing me off. You shooting my van is what's pissing me off, man.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> You Army Ranger, son?<eos> Be real careful of what you say next, pops.<eos> And be ready to empty that burner if you start shit-talking my battalion.<eos> Never shall I fail my comrades.<eos> Gallantly will I show the world that I am a specially selected soldier.<eos> Energetically will I meet the enemies of my country.<eos> I shall defeat them on the field of battle for I am better trained.
Don't seem like happiness will come along<eos> I've been lonely...<eos> You are not permitted in my dojo!<eos> So, Satan walks into this bar...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What's this, a lap pool?<eos> A dry steam room?<eos> Yeah, it'll go a long way with the boys.<eos> How in the hell do you pull this off?<eos> It's not who you know, Bob, it's how you know them.
The greatest ride is the last ride, Colonel!<eos> - Fire everything!<eos> - Come on, baby!<eos> Get right with God, y'all!<eos> This is it!<eos> Come on!<eos> Yee-ha!<eos> It's not fair to the fish!<eos> You're cheating!<eos> You with your nagging you're chasing them away!
You don't do that to kids.<eos> You just don't.<eos> You do that then you get what's coming to you, don't you?<eos> So fuck it off!<eos> It's dark.<eos> Can't we just turn off the lights and sneak out?<eos> No, he's set all this up, he'll have night-vision.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Well, there's one way to find out.<eos> He'll be expecting it.
Remember when we came back...<eos> - for Zachariah's funeral?<eos> - Vaguely.<eos> If memory serves, he wasn't the first Founder's Council member... - killed that year, or even that month.<eos> - Your point being?<eos> - I'm trying to remember what year it was.<eos> - 1912.<eos> So much for "vaguely."<eos> 1912.<eos> Or as I like to call it... the last time Mystic Falls had a serial killer on its hands.
Have you forgotten everything I taught you?<eos> Rebekah may be an Original, but she's a girl.<eos> You find her weakness and exploit it, and I'll walk right in.<eos> That is, if you want my help.<eos> Anyone ever tell you you're sexy when you're bitchy?<eos> We're talking now, are we?<eos> You were quite rude the other day. Using me to help you with Stefan, then shooing me away like a stray dog.<eos> Oh, that was brother business.<eos> You can't hold that against me.<eos> Besides, I really did appreciate your help, even if I didn't show it.
"Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"? What?<eos> No, I got--<eos> Damon. Thinks he's hilarious.<eos> At least one of us still has a sense of humor.<eos> Are you sure that you-- I mean, you don't have to be kept in here.<eos> Oh, no, this is... Ah, this is the right place for me to be.<eos> At least until you guys can convince my highly uncooperative alter ego to 'fess up to where I-- or...he hid the white oak stake.<eos> We looked everywhere. You...<eos> The other you hid it well.<eos> What's Klaus going to do if you can't find it?
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...<eos> Does Elena enjoy having both of you worship at her altar?<eos> I love you.<eos> But look me in the eye and tell me that you don't feel something for him.<eos> To break the sire bond, you've got make yourself turn.<eos> I just turned about a hundred times in the appalachian mountains.<eos> Won't know if it's broken for sure until I test it.
Thanks, Lavon.<eos> Fire!<eos> - You got a second?<eos> - Yup.<eos> Your dad came by my office. He's gonna go and sell to Large-Mart.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I know it's not what you wanted.<eos> No, it's not. But the main thing is I don't think it's what he wants either.<eos> Wade, I think he really wants to leave his land to his boys.<eos> - Why would he think we want it? - I don't know.
Can't you, Miss Fisher?<eos> Religious fervour was such a destructive force in his first marriage.<eos> Where is that painting now?<eos> I had the staff get rid of it.<eos> It seemed the most appropriate thing to do.<eos> Paul!<eos> You're home early.<eos> Um, come downstairs and I'll have the maid prepare something for you. Excuse me, Miss Fisher.<eos> I know where that painting is, if you want it.<eos> I couldn't let them throw it out.
What are you doing?<eos> You won't hurt her.<eos> Just help me!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You won't get away with this.<eos> Miss Fisher will make sure of it.<eos> I'll move the ammunition to the car.<eos> I thought the gun was just a show of strength! Nothing more.<eos> We are after gold, Nina.<eos> You think they will just hand it to us?
Hurry, I can't move!<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Adam wait!<eos> Look, I was just trying to figure out the medallion.<eos> The whole house felt like it was coming down.<eos> A woman came to see me, someone I saw at the boat yard fire 16 years ago.<eos> And I know that that sounds crazy.<eos> She said the witch hunters are coming, just like Jake said.<eos> This medallion is the best way I know how to protect us.<eos> I saw my dad use it to stop them.
Hurry.<eos> Quite a barricade.<eos> I don't have powers like you.<eos> How do you know I have powers?<eos> I'm a psychic.<eos> For what that's worth.<eos> I wanted to ask you something.<eos> About my father's medallion.<eos> The Balcoin medallion?<eos> I saw him use it against the witch hunters. That's how he escaped.
I've always been on the right side, Dawn.<eos> And it was never yours.<eos> I had so much fun.<eos> Happy Birthday, Adam!<eos> So we just have to do what you say 'cause you're the queen of dark magic?<eos> If we don't activate the medallion, then we're vulnerable to witch hunters.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Maybe we can use our full power to stop them without the medallion.<eos> But why take the chance?<eos> You saw your father use it, right?
So, what happened -- redheaded mommy make you stuff birds, put on dresses?<eos> You shouldn't trivialize other people's pain.<eos> So, demon comes along, rides co-pilot in your skull...<eos> Teaches you how to kill.<eos> That's yours.<eos> For years, it was just a game I would play.<eos> Every time I'd walk by one of them in the street or see one on my mail route...<eos> There's a sound that comes from their brains.<eos> You know that?<eos> Only I can hear it, like an evil, little steam whistle.
My name?<eos> Bruce Hornsby.<eos> All right.<eos> Who's next on the list?<eos> We got a, uh, gramophone sold to Brenda Gluck, 413 River Street, and a vintage gentlemen's magazine sold to Peter Yankit, 27 Johnson Lane.<eos> Really? Yeah.<eos> All right, we'd better split up.<eos> Why don't you take the gramophone?<eos> I'll handle the old rag.<eos> I wouldn't really "handle" it if I were you.
And you'll call as soon as the package is in hand?<eos> Absolutely. I'm here waiting.<eos> In fact, I've got time for a light snack.<eos> Hey, Charlie.<eos> I was hoping I'd find you here.<eos> Watch it.<eos> So now what?<eos> I've been looking for this for a very, very long time.<eos> Now, who could have done that?<eos> A courier's set to pick it up.
Your sales team stays out -- period.<eos> That's not up for negotiation.<eos> We need America.<eos> They're so fat.<eos> And in exchange?<eos> The blood of one sadly unimpressive demon in New Jersey.<eos> All I ask is that you give it to frick and frack, tell them it's yours, stand back, and let them come to me.<eos> I can't deny I long to see those two digested once and for all.<eos> You have a deal.<eos> I suppose you want it in writing?
Last season's not very good, but--<eos> Montreal?<eos> Come on.<eos> Think of all the good things you've done.<eos> Like what?<eos> Waste countless Sundays at these... stupid fucking couples brunches?<eos> How about the countless lives you've saved?<eos> The people you've helped, the lives you've improved, the hope you gave people.<eos> Yeah, well-- Yeah, there is that.<eos> I'm gonna go get that wine that we brought, and I'm gonna open it, and we're gonna drink it.
And thousands of ants.<eos> Maybe they live inside her body and ride around in boats.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Maybe her blood has become really thick like jelly.<eos> A boat might not work.<eos> Excuse me, would you have any food for us?<eos> I can give you something for it.<eos> Don't put so much wood on it.<eos> Maybe blow on it a little.<eos> Not so hard, you'll just blow it out.
And now.<eos> Look, here, Zulu!<eos> Give me your hands and now...<eos> Please.<eos> I can't.<eos> Thomas with Lisa - 1936<eos> Lisa - Breakfast<eos> - Spreewald<eos> A good boy waits until he is served.<eos> Put it on your plate, you've touched it now.
No, you can't do that here.<eos> Where am I supposed to do it?<eos> Um, at your house?<eos> Hilarious...<eos> I'm just gonna jump in beside you.<eos> I don't mind if you stay.<eos> Oh, for God's sakes, Finn.<eos> Can't you at least try to keep some sort of mystery until we're married?<eos> What do you think it's gonna be like in New York?<eos> We'll be on opposite schedules, so, you know, you can use the bathroom while I'm at school and I'll use it when you're at... when you're working or what-whatever.
I hope that, one day, you can build up enough courage to be him.<eos> Actually, Unique's a "her."<eos> That's why I want your advice.<eos> Our regionals are this Saturday, and I want to go on stage wearing a dress and heels.<eos> Because that's who I feel like I am inside.<eos> Unique.<eos> Yes.<eos> What would you do?<eos> Did someone steal our floor?<eos> Don't worry, we'll have it back by the end of the week.
Scary? Nothing scares you, man.<eos> Your five-mile ride on top of Mrs. Witt's Chrysler is still a car-surfing record, okay.<eos> Seriously, just... you'll have that place wired in no time.<eos> So if you're not going with me, what are you going to do?<eos> I still really don't know.<eos> Well, do me one favor, would you?<eos> When you do find your dream, make it as big as you are.<eos> I don't know much, but I know this.<eos> You owe it to yourself.<eos> And now you owe it to me.
They all want to buy your album, and so do I.<eos> You ain't no skim milk, baby.<eos> You're the cream rising to the top.<eos> Boobs Magoo, words simply cannot describe how disappointed I am in you.<eos> And look at poor Brittany.<eos> Her chagrin is limited only by the fact that she has a brain the size of a toddler's fist.<eos> I can show you the MRI.<eos> And it's not just the sex tape.<eos> My goodness, sex tapes are a dime a dozen these days. I myself made a sex tape with Oliver North.<eos> Wasn't very popular, probably because we released it on Betamax.
He's set records for the highest jump from a building... and the lowest.<eos> But for this mission,<eos> Felix needs to jump from 20 miles higher than he has ever been before.<eos> Just getting there requires a multi-million dollar space programme.<eos> Screw it in, screw it in.<eos> It's still got to go this way.<eos> A team of 20 engineers and scientists is working on the technology to fly Felix beyond the stratosphere.<eos> We're trying to take a human being up into space and have him come back safely.<eos> I've got a diagram here.<eos> I call it a plumbing diagram - we're space plumbers.
I'm fine.<eos> If the others ask, it's a stomach bug.<eos> Sleep, yes?<eos> Orla...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't!<eos> Is this about your friend?<eos> The one you told me about, needing the abortion?<eos> Is it a fictional friend?<eos> If I had a man, don't you think you might know about it?
There'll be snowploughs in Hell before Kinnock lets us lot back in the fold.<eos> He blames us for his humiliation at the polls.<eos> By splitting the vote we let Thatcher back in.<eos> What exactly does a Special Adviser do?<eos> They're the ghosts in the political machine, Jay.<eos> The power behind the throne.<eos> Or the fall guy when things go down the pan.<eos> Charlotte, how's life in the North?<eos> Still keeping coal in t'bath, are they?<eos> They have to keep it somewhere.
Felt absurdly... proud of you, actually.<eos> And motherhood?<eos> How's that been?<eos> Best thing that's ever happened to me.<eos> Bar none.<eos> And you?<eos> What's with you on the home front?<eos> Well, as it happens...<eos> What's with Heseltine's leadership bid, Jack?<eos> Think Maggie will survive it?
Oh, thank God, Professor.<eos> You got here just in time.<eos> I've seen this before.<eos> Langdon Cobb must be from Bryoria Six, home of the quantum lichen people.<eos> Well, that explains that.<eos> They're attention parasites.<eos> They feed on the admiration of their prey.<eos> Just like the noble buffalo.<eos> Nothing like a buffalo.<eos> Anyone who pays attention to the lichen is unknowingly feeding it.
Voilá.<eos> The tragic end of Rome o.<eos> And Julie t.<eos> That's Romeo and Juliet, dummy, by Will.I.Am Shakespeare.<eos> Now, here's the poison that Romeo uses to kill himself.<eos> Don't worry, it's just water and food coloring.<eos> Food coloring?<eos> The most poisonous substance known to robots?<eos> Oops, sorry.<eos> I'll swap it out for harmless battery acid.
All right, we will.<eos> Come on, Amy.<eos> Why don't you and I ever do things together?<eos> This is hard.<eos> Now I know why butterflies are always so grouchy.<eos> Please welcome tonight's volunteer victims:<eos> Turanga Leela and Amy Wong!<eos> Hang on. We're not quite ready to...<eos> You girls have moxie.<eos> We're going to beat it out of you.
Voldemort.<eos> I will shut it down.<eos> Shall I go home and get my bullhorn?<eos> Yes!<eos> Go!<eos> Go! Go get your bullhorn!<eos> Are you ready for this, brother?<eos> Wait, uh...<eos> Why do we need the whale - If we're doing Cain and Abel? - Oh!<eos> In my version, Cain throws Abel's body into the ocean, the whale eats it and that's when Jesus brings him back to life. Uh...
- Pssh! The savoury goat against the sweet challa bread is a symphony of flavor.<eos> - It is a winner.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> Do you have a name for this little baby?<eos> - Yeah, I'm thinking the Natewich.<eos> - Not a chance!<eos> My food, my restaurant.<eos> We are naming it after me.<eos> It will be called the Fatwich.<eos> You're naming it after yourself?
And the devil sent him back, so he wanders, looking for blood to make it whole.<eos> More blood, more strength.<eos> Well, are you talking about some kind of ghost?<eos> Coffin for the child.<eos> This is kraho, from the chonta palm.<eos> Full of tsarutuma.<eos> The shamans use it to catch the angry soul.<eos> Your father used blood to lure the spirit.<eos> They caught it inside, but we opened it.<eos> ...Sangre de Lena. We fed it with Lena's blood.
I don't know anything about plants.<eos> Understood, but just try and picture.<eos> Was there anything on the border between the garden and the farmland?<eos> There was a flood there in 2006. Killed off pretty much everything.<eos> You could see straight up to the trees.<eos> There was nothing, nothing growing.<eos> Right. Thanks.<eos> The blackcurrant bushes weren't there when I bought the place.<eos> Somebody dumped the body after I bought it!<eos> They dumped it with the blackcurrant bush for me to find it.
We'll find out where she is.<eos> - OK.<eos> - All right, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kurt.<eos> You OK, Monika?<eos> It's a symphony of crying people.<eos> 44 different crying, voices isn't the word.<eos> I leave them a little recorder.<eos> They switch it on when they're upset.
OK, we're just going in here for a minute, all right?<eos> It's OK.<eos> Don't worry. Sorry.<eos> We're done.<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> 'Early indications suggest the biggest cash robbery in UK history.'<eos> We can just go.<eos> Me and you, take off.<eos> We have a plan and we're sticking to it.
Then we've got until Friday, right?<eos> At least.<eos> You'd better hope you don't hit traffic.<eos> When have I ever been late for anything?<eos> Well, hang on, wait.<eos> A job interview requires a Windsor knot.<eos> Shows you take care and pay attention to smaller details.<eos> Yeah, I don't think the tie will swing it for me.<eos> You can get this job.<eos> If you want it badly enough, you can get it.
The men with the need, the motive, the ability, and I'm afraid<eos> Chris... Chris ticks all the boxes.<eos> I'm not sure if he can...<eos> I don't know if he's mentally strong enough.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You really know him that well, do you, Marcus?<eos> He's a mate.<eos> All he has to do is give the code.<eos> Then we'll know for sure who's side he's on.<eos> And if he doesn't give it?
Why are you in here, Dad?<eos> You know what I did.<eos> Yeah, but why?<eos> You're a tough guy.<eos> Why couldn't you ever walk away from it?<eos> And why did you always have to be so proud?<eos> Do you feel better, bitch?<eos> Wow!<eos> Did your balls finally drop on the way over here?<eos> I don't care that you want my job, I don't care that one day soon you'll have it.
He's in congestive heart failure.<eos> They're taking him to the OR.<eos> They need to put him on a cardio-pulmonary bypass machine immediately.<eos> But the new heart has not been recovered yet!<eos> I'm sorry. We have no other choice.<eos> Hello?<eos> - Have you found him yet?<eos> - Yes. - Is he on his way back here?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> I promise no harm will come to him if he brings me the package, but he needs to bring it to me now.
Power still falling.<eos> All right, what's going on?<eos> We're under attack!<eos> - From who?<eos> - Unknown!<eos> A pulse weapon has knocked out the power grid, communications are down, and we have voltage spikes in the reactor turbines!<eos> Radar is tracking an incoming missile.<eos> How close?<eos> 30 seconds to impact.<eos> The EM shield will knock it out before impact if we can keep it online!
You're a felon.<eos> Well, guess we're not going out for beers.<eos> Any sign of intrusion?<eos> Besides him, no.<eos> But I did find this weird bit stream rattling around in the mainframe.<eos> Where?<eos> It's all over. It's like a ghost. It disappears from one subsystem, and then it pops up in another.<eos> That's the problem right there.<eos> I'm deploying a level-six antivirus to purge the G.D. System.<eos> Whatever your ghost is, PanOp will kill it.
Help!<eos> Help!<eos> Is anyone out there?<eos> Is anyone up there?<eos> Damn it.<eos> Mobile lab launch successful.<eos> Yeah, depends on your point of view.<eos> Surprise!<eos> You pulled a prank on me?<eos> Well, I wouldn't so much call it a prank - as a surprise!
- Zane...<eos> I'm not interested in stooping to your level.<eos> My level.<eos> Does that look like a chunk of the new submersible to you?<eos> To me it looks like a key section of the digital integrated circuitry that powers every operating system on board.<eos> Worse than chunk.<eos> Yeah, a little bit.<eos> The mobile lab's not too mobile anymore.<eos> How'd that get here?<eos> Fowler relocated it.
Why don't I buy you a beer?<eos> You called me "Berdee."<eos> What's that?<eos> You said "Ben Berdee."<eos> That's your name.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Well, on the plane, we introduced ourselves.<eos> I said my name was Ben.<eos> "Berdee" is a nickname.<eos> Not too many people know it, this far North.
"Bright lights Gavin Kwan," up here in the North?<eos> The trendy night clubs of Yellowknife, weekly mail runs to Bison River?<eos> We could do this every week.<eos> I talked to the lease company.<eos> And?<eos> Contract's iron-clad.<eos> We're stuck with it.<eos> Of course we are!<eos> It's a good thing, too. It's a hell of a deal.<eos> Yeah, and how do we pay for it?
When I buy you dinner, you'll know I'm interested.<eos> You did apply for a job with me.<eos> The way I know you applied for a job with me is that I have your resume on my iPad, the way I know you would kill puppies to get this job is the way you stopped breathing when I said the name "Olivia Pope," which is a tell,<eos> your tell, which you should look at, 'cause I'm gonna offer you a crap salary, and you'll have to take it, 'cause we all get paid crap salaries because we're the good guys.<eos> I'm a good guy, which means I generally don't lie, but I just did to you.<eos> This is not a job interview.<eos> Wait.<eos> I don't, um, I'm confused.<eos> Olivia already told me to hire you.<eos> The job is yours, if you want it.
- You're evil.<eos> You can use the bathroom, but only for number ones.<eos> No number twos. I see what you feed this motherfucker, and it's disgusting.<eos> Casper, the bathroom is down the hah right down here.<eos> I guess the feeling went away. Casper!<eos> Do not mess with these, they're all alphabetized.<eos> - Don't touch my Criterions.<eos> - Come on, Kenny.<eos> Just give me your mama's mailing address.<eos> Where do you keep it?
Welcome, "alones again."<eos> We are gonna start...<eos> Heather, darling, I think you're in the wrong group.<eos> No, I... I actually tried the other one, and it's not for me.<eos> Besides, I qualify as "alone again."<eos> Don't I know it.<eos> But this kind of alone is for people who are actually able to pull off getting married and are only now single.<eos> It's no big deal. Just let her stay.<eos> I'd be happy to, but as one of sweet, solitary Heather's dearest friends, I pray nightly for her to find the love and security of male companionship.<eos> Now she won't find it in this activity, but down-the-hall's activities are specifically designed for her chasm-like needs...
The Lord was sending me a sign, and on that billboard, it said, "thou shalt not snoop."<eos> Now God does not want me looking in on just anybody, least of all Amanda Vaughn!<eos> Now, kitten...<eos> I am your husband.<eos> Yes, but there's one man whose orders come before yours, and I'm gonna talk to him right now.<eos> Y...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> It's not the photos that caused the controversy. It's the name.<eos> So if we want to save the brand, we have to change what's on the label.<eos> Instead of "Westward Ho!"... how about calling it...
Welcome back into the fold.<eos> Thank... oh.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Talk is cheap, darling.<eos> You can't just tell me you love me.<eos> You're gonna have to show me.<eos> I've never had turkey bacon before.<eos> You really are from California.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Mama hates it, too.
The rest of the youth, go enjoy tweens and teens fellowship.<eos> So it's just us grown-ups now, right?<eos> 'Cause this message is adults-only.<eos> People who've seen the sermon board this week have asked, "what is divine?"<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> Sex is divine.<eos> Inspired by Amanda.<eos> Surprise, surprise.<eos> Sex is a gift from God.<eos> He created it to strengthen the union between two people who love each other, to increase their intimacy, improve their communication.
I could sell that painting tomorrow for half a million euros?<eos> - I'd say you'd have to steal it first.<eos> - Speaking hypothetically, of course. - Of course.<eos> - Name's Tracy.<eos> - This is Mr. Voros.<eos> - Let's get this over with.<eos> The sooner he makes the delivery, the sooner I get my money.<eos> Now, you be careful with that, because you have no idea how much it's worth.<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> - The package in your trunk, give it to me.

A nice Jewish girl, from an American suburb.<eos> The pictures... the one with you and the older gentleman in a suit?<eos> - My grandfather.<eos> - The Pissarro? It was fake.<eos> My buyer's expert barely looked at it... he had no doubt.<eos> When you see the real thing, you know right away.<eos> There's an essence that no forger ever captures.<eos> But you thought I had the real one.<eos> I heard that the original was in Berlin:<eos> Anton Khyber wants it, and Charles Tracy offered it to him.
- His fingers are missing.<eos> It means he stuck to his story, right to the end. He was telling the truth... he had nothing to do with this.<eos> - Are you going to be okay? - Yeah.<eos> Do you need a minute?<eos> I'll look around.<eos> - I think I'll take that, for just a little while.<eos> We better get out of here.<eos> Now what?<eos> We still have the forgery.<eos> Why did you keep it?
Don't you think he's worth looking for?<eos> By roughing up people who had nothing to do with it?<eos> I've heard the group taking responsibility recruits here.<eos> What makes you so sure they had nothing to do with it?<eos> They're my students.<eos> And they're innocent until proven otherwise.<eos> I learned that from CSI:<eos> Do you think he's still alive?<eos> So tell me, Bobby, what exactly is the article about?<eos> Well, I'm still working on it, but so far the logline is,
Not interested.<eos> We haven't even heard his offer.<eos> I can get you access, hmm?<eos> Politicians, judges.<eos> you need girls or boys for your blood-den places, they're yours.<eos> Something goes wrong, well, we handle the waste- management side of things too.<eos> In exchange, we grant you the strength to wipe out anyone who stands in your way.<eos> You sky-rocket through the mob ranks, we get little, you get immortality.<eos> Nah-uh. No, we don't need his help.<eos> Until I get it from my own people, I do.
Carter? You talked to Jo about where she's going after here?<eos> No.<eos> Been a little bit busy. Why?<eos> Well, uh, I'm... I'm just trying to figure out what she wants, 'cause she's not really saying.<eos> Before a wormhole relocates you to another zip code you might wanna try talking to her.<eos> We've got a half-dozen more incidents, and now your daughter has joined Fargo's cause.<eos> - Nice work, Kissinger.<eos> - Should have seen that coming.<eos> Are you guys making any progress?<eos> Well, I'm just making a list of the pros and cons as to why we're actually saving this place when they're just gonna shut it down anyway.
The neural impulses in our brains.<eos> Abstract thought, logic, the higher functions will go first, and then it'll hit the other stuff.<eos> What other stuff?<eos> You know, speech, movement...<eos> Bladder control.<eos> That other stuff.<eos> I have to take responsibility!<eos> You have nothing to confess to!<eos> Grace, I stole classified information.<eos> A different man committed that crime and you know it.
So you deal with it.<eos> Checkmate.<eos> Well played.<eos> Well, you persuaded Dr. Dearing to let me see the forgery.<eos> I am impressed.<eos> Don't be.<eos> They shredded it?<eos> They shredded it?<eos> Yes, they do that to discourage the market in forgeries.<eos> I got them just before they got it into the incinerator.
- What? - Nothing to worry about.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> Joe?<eos> Oh, hey, Mel, does this cabinet look level to you?<eos> Joe, isn't that something Leo the contractor should be doing?<eos> Yeah, but he got called away on personal business.<eos> And he took his tools and his sawhorses and his guys?<eos> I guess, yeah.<eos> So what is this personal business that Leo got called away to do?<eos> I would categorize it as a... hissy fit.
or whatever it is you people do.<eos> Is she...<eos> I got this.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Just... one minute.<eos> It's a good speech.<eos> It's the same speech every president has given at the O.A.S. for the past 40 years.<eos> I'm pretty sure things have changed since the Cuban revolution, and I'm giving the same speech.<eos> It's a great speech.<eos> I bet Eisenhower thought so when he wrote it, but I'd like to say something a little more original.
Ellen, Joe<eos> How is he doing doc ?<eos> He is fine, just a little overheated<eos> Do you mind if I ask you a few questions ?<eos> No Sir<eos> What is your last name ?<eos> I don't have one<eos> No last name ?<eos> No Sir<eos> You can't remember it ?
Extry, extry, read all about it.<eos> My grandfather always claimed I would inherit a secret fortune.<eos> But when he died, all he left me was this one mysterious key.<eos> I don't have any money to pay you, but if you find out what this key opens, you can have half of whatever's inside.<eos> Wow, that sounds like a fun journey.<eos> Here's your chance to give some bad news.<eos> Tell this kid to hit the bricks.<eos> Listen, you look like a nice kid and all, but we're not gonna be able to take our eyes off your sweater.<eos> Is it soft?<eos> Can I wear it without a T-shirt under it, you know, how black guys sometimes wear sweaters?
Too many Mexicans! See?<eos> I don't even believe that.<eos> I believe it a little.<eos> Which one should I do first?<eos> Steve.<eos> Sorry, kiddo.<eos> I'm getting to the top of the mountain and breaking that curse, and you kids aren't gonna stop me.<eos> Hey, Papa.<eos> Looks like you did a little sleepwalking last night.<eos> You had a knife, and we figured you were gonna whittle something, so, we went ahead and did it for you.
All we have to do is test-drive a car.<eos> Here, put this on.<eos> Why?<eos> Because, if we're going to test drive Ferraris, we need to look the part.<eos> Like Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman, when he convinces that sales guy to let him and Chris O'Donnell take a car.<eos> Interesting fact:<eos> Chris O'Donnell, no mental handicap.<eos> I just love the original details in these old buildings.<eos> This place is perfect.<eos> For $350 a month, we'll take it.
Hey, check out this picture James Woods texted me.<eos> What is that?<eos> A balloon running out of air?<eos> Yeah, see, I was hoping you would know.<eos> It's his cousin's anus.<eos> Good evening, Quahog. I'm Tom Tucker. And I'm Joyce Kinney.<eos> Tom, I think I speak for all of us here at Channel Five News when I say it's good to have you back here at half your original salary.<eos> Still twice yours, Joyce.<eos> Our top story tonight: Quahog's first organic supermarket opens this weekend.<eos> So head on down before the gays turn it into a cruising ground like they did the Barnes and Noble upstairs coffee bar, which they had to close.
Guys, you know how we were thinking that something must have caused this situation... or someone?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Look at that.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's him.<eos> He did this.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Check it out.<eos> I got the little freak's bra.<eos> I'm gonna put it on.
It's true.<eos> It's true.<eos> Take the dress off, sweetheart.<eos> Your mother says you can't have it.<eos> W-wait, wait, wait a minute.<eos> Do you really love it?<eos> I do. It just feels like my wedding dress.<eos> Oh, Mom, she loves it.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll take it.
Then I shall find one.<eos> And we will win.<eos> And she and I will dance on your grave!<eos> I really went too far with the whole "dance on your grave" thing.<eos> The competition doesn't mean that much to me.<eos> Although I am going to find a partner, and we will win.<eos> And we will dance on your grave!<eos> Ah, sorry about that.<eos> Do you realize since I've been watching you you've gone through 24 pairs of underwear?<eos> Maybe stop giving me a juice every time I ask for it.
Well, just have a drink.<eos> Give her a ring. You might have lots in common.<eos> I know you're trying to be nice, but, really, this is way beyond your remit as sergeant.<eos> I can manage my own life.<eos> Don't lose that number.<eos> I worked hard for that.<eos> Who has been using my milk?<eos> No-one touches your milk.<eos> It's soya and it's blue.<eos> I dye it blue, but it makes no difference, because someone is still stealing it.
Megan Draper just invited me to her party.<eos> At the very last minute.<eos> Don't tell me that girl's not conniving.<eos> You think she wants you around her husband?<eos> I'm going to lie down.<eos> Sometimes life makes decisions for you.<eos> - Have a good day.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Bonjour.<eos> - I know your birthday was last week, and I was told you don't celebrate it and not to bring it up.
What the hell is this?<eos> Oh, this.<eos> Uh, I remember.<eos> I didn't sign it.<eos> Of course you did. Right there.<eos> You want me to play detective?<eos> - Don, we all sign a lot of things.<eos> - Is this the only one?<eos> I won't sit here and bear this interrogation.<eos> You want a professional to do it?
- Roger sterling.<eos> - Don draper.<eos> Ed, you said they're gonna bring your son-in-law.<eos> Ken knows better.<eos> So, Don, what's so urgent?<eos> I didn't say urgent.<eos> I said imminent.<eos> Well, Ed, I wanna talk about your business. What about it?<eos> See, I've been looking at what you're doing and I think you're in desperate need of change.<eos> - And you're just the guy to do it.

At least go lie down.<eos> Eat your sandwich.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> Oh, my lord.<eos> - Those poor souls.<eos> - What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Some things are not for children.<eos> Mommy lets me watch the news.<eos> You demanded tuna salad, so you're going to sit there until you eat it.
My boss was rejecting him and I thought it was all he could handle.<eos> What was the story? - Forget it.<eos> - No, we want to know.<eos> It's called "The Punishment Of X4."<eos> There's this bridge between these two planets and thousands of humans travel on it every day.<eos> And so there's this robot; he does maintenance on the bridge.<eos> And one day, he removes a bolt and the bridge collapses and everyone dies.<eos> There's more to it than that, you know.<eos> But it's just a story.<eos> Why does he do it?
Men don't take the time to end things.<eos> They ignore you until you insist on a declaration of hate.<eos> Someone dumped you?<eos> Peggy, I'm just like everybody else.<eos> If he's going to end it, which I doubt, you'll know what to do.<eos> If he's going to propose, you'd better have your answer prepared, especially if it's no.<eos> Gosh.<eos> I should go home and change, shouldn't I?<eos> Or better yet, go shopping.<eos> So the mom's wearing the glass space helmet and the kid took his off and put it on the table?
Say cheese, buddy.<eos> It's hot.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It is hot.<eos> The sun's setting, so it will cool down in a few minutes.<eos> Take a look at what I'm doing, Danny boy.<eos> You're going to have to know how to set up your own tent someday.<eos> Hey, will you do me a favor?<eos> In the top of my backpack is my knife.<eos> Can you get it for me?
This is somebody you were trying to get away from, is it?<eos> - It's not what...<eos> - No.<eos> Stuart, he'd... He'd lost all his visiting rights. Obviously.<eos> But Stella...<eos> I used to dread her birthday coming round, you know.<eos> She'd wait till Brian, my husband, was out of the house and she'd get this look on her face.<eos> And I knew it was coming.<eos> Every year.<eos> Her "special present" she called it.
Where is Salmander?<eos> Ave Satanii!<eos> Ave Satanii!<eos> Killevippen.<eos> Take care of the brownie.<eos> Sure.<eos> -Got ID?<eos> -Police, I have to get in.<eos> -No, you need to have ID.<eos> -Can you get it later?
The most honest thing that I can tell you about myself right now, Kendal, is that... I'm a man in love with an incredible woman.<eos> There's the man! Whoo! Congratulations!<eos> Congratulations!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Uh-huh!<eos> Hi. This is gideon Wallace from "the D.C. sun."<eos> We spoke last week about Amanda Tanner in 3-b.<eos> Yes, I do know what time it is.<eos> Hey, I know it's late, but I... do you know who's looking after Amanda's dog? I think it's a golden retriever.<eos> Do you know who's watching it for her?
Hey, I like playing Mission: Impossible as much as the next guy, but, uh, I'm starting to feel like somebody doesn't trust me.<eos> Who?<eos> Me?<eos> Caleb!<eos> Come on, I trust you.<eos> But... not with this.<eos> We have gotten naked together in more ways than one, Han.<eos> Why are we suddenly strangers when it comes to a stolen phone?<eos> It wasn't stolen;<eos> We found it.
Did you get together with them?<eos> The Americans are with the No.<eos> "If I govern, you govern."<eos> "Yes, for a winning country."<eos> "We are millions."<eos> Lucho Guzmán.<eos> Good you came so that you can explain that theory of yours, about people wanting to return to the past.<eos> No, Minister.<eos> What I meant to say was the concept of dictatorship packs a harsh, strong punch.<eos> And that on top of that, now they're going to say it on television.
Please, this plebiscite is a fraud, we all know it.<eos> Dad...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm here, working.<eos> This isn't work, you're playing.<eos> Hand me the rocket. Hand me the rocket that's over there.<eos> It's my present, I'm going to put it together!<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Well, it's already put together.<eos> Then I'm going to drive it. Come on!
There's another thing.<eos> I'm not Doug any more.<eos> I'm also the head teacher and that means you have to call me by my proper name Mr Cyhoeddus-Gwalchmai.<eos> LAUGHTER<eos> Yes, all right, very amusing.<eos> Rich is supposed to be my project partner.<eos> His girlfriend just died.<eos> I don't think he cares about your fucking coursework.<eos> I suppose. He'll be back when he's got over things.<eos> Just get Franky to do it for you. Everyone else does.
It'll all be OK.<eos> We'll go and we'll think when we're there.<eos> Does that sound OK?<eos> Can I stay at yours until we go?<eos> Come over tomorrow morning.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Did you find my passport?<eos> Well, its got to be around here somewhere!<eos> I'm not having it.
Well, I'd better go and check on the poor babe. See, the thing is...<eos> I don't think she's really up to seeing anyone at the moment.<eos> I mean, she's changing right now so, erm...<eos> All right, Mum?<eos> Yeah, you?<eos> Nice tan!<eos> Going to tell me what the fuck's going on, sweetheart?<eos> You've destroyed the house and... this bed smells disgusting!<eos> Oh, er, Mum, Mum! Stop it!<eos> I'm going to wash it!
Give me a line. Stay with us, buddy.<eos> I'm here with you now.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You know, at some unconscious level, you might have always suspected that Cooper was innocent.<eos> Cooper's failed appeal coincided with your son's death, which caused you to create a dream in which you had to prove Cooper's innocence.<eos> Or you would have to relive the loss of your son.<eos> If I had known, if I had suspected on any level there was something wrong with the Cooper case, I would have done something by myself a long time ago.<eos> But you didn't, and it's understandable why.<eos> People naturally flee from their own guilt.<eos> They push it aside.
# They say every distance is not near #<eos> # I remember every face #<eos> # Of every man who put me here #<eos> # I see my light come shining #<eos> # From the west down to the east #<eos> # Any day now #<eos> # Any day now #<eos> # I shall be released #<eos> Enclosed, please find a newspaper artcle.<eos> You might have seen it when it was published, although I doubt it.
Look after yourself, boy.<eos> Look after yourself... Don Raphael.<eos> The Ministry of Sport has annulled the National league finals.<eos> Levski have been declared the new champions following the formal award of a three-nil victory against Macedonia.<eos> And here is the weather forecast: partly cloudy with a chance of rain in the afternoon.<eos> We continue our broadcast with popular music...<eos> On a day like this, many years ago, it was my birthday.<eos> My father surprised me with a gift, my first football.<eos> I couldn't take my eyes off it.<eos> I took it everywhere, even to the outhouse on our family farm.
I'm good.<eos> Shea and I were thinking that one explanation for this is that it was written by a convict.<eos> See, we can't write letters to other convicts at other penitentiaries, so convict "a" writes a letter to his accomplice on the outside... quite possibly a female... who sends his letter to convict "b"...<eos> Damien... using her own envelope and a P.O box, which is registered to a bogus name...<eos> John Brooks does not exist;<eos> Jules checked.<eos> We're thinking it could be Brent Howson, - Damien's old partner.<eos> - Yeah, but the contents of these letters are benign... all they're doing is just going back and forth about sports, movies...<eos> Well, that's what's visible.<eos> You want to send a coded message on the inside, you write it with urine.

I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.<eos> I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, lmp.<eos> If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself.<eos> Instead she sends you.<eos> What am I to make of that?<eos> I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately.<eos> And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?<eos> As I said several times.<eos> And you've waited this long to deliver the information?<eos> When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay.
These are dreams, Bran, nothing more.<eos> No, my dreams are different.<eos> Mine are true.<eos> I dreamt of my father dying.<eos> And Rickon had the same dream.<eos> What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Right.<eos> This link is made of Valyrian steel.<eos> Only one Maester in 100 wears it on his chain.
Has no chance of becoming champion of France and on top of that, she'll end up an old maid.<eos> Double.<eos> I look like a nobody I can't go to the championships dressed like this.<eos> Ah, there'll be worse than you, I assure you.<eos> Look at this, it's flat.<eos> - Hang on, here's just what you need !<eos> - I can carry on alone.<eos> We'll meet at 8, at the hotel, at the latest.<eos> Don't get lost.<eos> Rose, are you gonna wear that dress, or sew it?
It's not your colour.<eos> I'll give you another.<eos> While is so marvelous on you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Paul, what do you think?<eos> Sorry. monsieur. H's sold out.<eos> Maybe you should wall for some days.<eos> Never mind. I can wait.<eos> By the time this dress is finished. You'll be mine.<eos> Why not wear it and travel with me somewhere?
Okay, that's enough.<eos> Both of you.<eos> This is a hospital.<eos> You wanna fight?<eos> You take it to an Irish pub where fights belong.<eos> Dr. Van Dyke, I am sure you have patients to see.<eos> And Dr. Lawson, if you have a complaint, I'll accept it in writing.<eos> Do I make myself clear?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Listen, Hank, if there is a problem, I will find it and I will deal with it.
That's his problem.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> What he thinks of you or doesn't think, what he approves of or doesn't approve of, we don't care anymore.<eos> - We don't?<eos> - No.<eos> And... I can't wait anymore.<eos> What...<eos> Evan R. Lawson, will you marry me?<eos> In a heartbeat, Paige Collins.<eos> I just wish that we had your mom's ring so you could put it on me.
But you weren't supposed to start in the first place.<eos> I thought that was very clear.<eos> Well, you said you needed plans.<eos> You didn't say anything about not starting to build before you had them.<eos> Well, if that were the case, what would be the point of them?<eos> Now you're talking.<eos> Those are my sentiments exactly.<eos> Mr. Morrison, no matter what you may think, no matter what you may believe, a building permit is not optional.<eos> And just so you and I are perfectly clear, that Stop Work order, - that's a legally binding document. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Ignore it at your peril.
Do you remember when I built our dining room table?<eos> We'd been using a sawhorse and planks for so many years, I... I had all but given up on ever getting a proper one.<eos> My father helped me mill the boards.<eos> I put 12 coats of finish on that table.<eos> Which still didn't help when Ruth split ink on it.<eos> Oh, I wasn't that upset.<eos> You were very table-proud back then. No.<eos> It's a very nice piece of carpentry.<eos> Do you know how much a harvest table would have cost you in a store?<eos> The first few years... every nick that table absorbed... I took it personally.
I think that Artie would love to see his dad play Joe DiMaggio.<eos> Even for $200 a week.<eos> Michael.<eos> Julia, hi.<eos> I didn't expect to see you here.<eos> Likewise.<eos> I wanted to talk Eileen through the new outline.<eos> She's not in yet.<eos> Would you mind giving this to her, please?<eos> I'll put it right on her desk.
And when all else failed to preoccupy my mind, I would help Jake Rosati work on his grind.<eos> This is frustrating.<eos> Maybe we should...<eos> - Take off our clothes?<eos> - Or go inside.<eos> Before my dad gets suspicious.<eos> Right.<eos> It's getting late, I should go.<eos> Only if you promise to open my Christmas present tonight.<eos> Ohoh. Where can I find it?
You can charge me, you can charge me, but-but what jury is going to believe that I killed a girl, cut her up, and then dumped her in the museum, all in 38 seconds?<eos> You did it, but you couldn't have done it.<eos> It's quantum indeterminacy.<eos> I knew you'd say that.<eos> I have a lot of time on my hands, so I've read all the court transcripts where you guys gave testimony.<eos> You are not gonna get away with this, pal.<eos> Actually, it kind of looks like he is.<eos> It's the giant flaw in our system.<eos> Trying to make the system secure, we make it more complex.<eos> But the more complex we make it, the more insecure we actually are.
Better?<eos> Are you referring to Graham's death as better?<eos> No.<eos> He was a good man, Ms. Swan.<eos> He made this town safe. And forgive me for saying it, but you have not earned the right to wear his badge.<eos> Graham picked me to be Deputy.<eos> He was wrong.<eos> No, he knew what he was doing.<eos> He freed this office from your leash.<eos> You're not getting it back.
- Give me the ticket.<eos> I'll collect it.<eos> - I think I lost it.<eos> - Come on, what happened to it?<eos> I was in such a state that night with the drink, I just binned it.<eos> - You binned your best suit?<eos> - Yeah, it was in a state, so I binned it.<eos> No, it was you that was in a state.<eos> Lily, leave it.<eos> I told you, I'm telling you now, I binned it.
Did you take the ring?<eos> I, I...<eos> I didn't think anyone would notice.<eos> It's evidence in a murder trial, son.<eos> You can go to jail. I could lose my job.<eos> I figured it wasn't important.<eos> And that's a good enough reason to steal?<eos> I wanted to give it to my girlfriend.<eos> Your what?<eos> She likes that kind of stuff, and I can totally get it back.
Some athlete?<eos> Try Doug Perry.<eos> The New York Yankee. Oh.<eos> Sorry, mate. If she divorced a cricket player, I might recognize the name.<eos> If she divorced a cricket player, she wouldn't have gotten $12 million. Another?<eos> Uh... yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, another.<eos> Well, Gaby, we are very fond of Carlos and everyone at global, but help me out here. How can I tell our board we're going with your firm instead of a larger one with a longer track record?<eos> Four words... "Open-architecture investment platform."<eos> So as opposed to tightly controlling our portfolio, you would open it up to a number of asset managers.
- That'd be great solution.<eos> Great solution.<eos> - (ALL laughing) - Simon is an alpha male.<eos> Actually, I think that is a good idea.<eos> - Why are you guys laughing?<eos> - Stop, Mom.<eos> Seriously, Mike has a fake dog.<eos> You're like the only one here who doesn't know that.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, he uses it to get out of stuff like if he's late.
- It's no secret things aren't perfect between him and I.<eos> I spent so much time keeping my head down just carrying out my duties as a wife, as a mother, as a size two.<eos> Sometimes I have to remind myself to look up and think about the things that I want, and then I did and there you were standing in the wrong place at the wrong time, I guess.<eos> - I guess.<eos> - My marriage may not be perfect but, George, I'm fixing to rediscover myself.<eos> I'm fixing to laser-engrave my own happiness into a glistening ball of crystal.<eos> I'm a store owner, I'm an entrepreneur I'm an independent woman in the 2000-teens.<eos> Holler!<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> The job is still yours if you want it.
We'll be awaiting your payment.<eos> Alberto shore de Canada.<eos> What is your real name?<eos> Jack.<eos> Jack Begosian.<eos> What brings you to these mountains,<eos> Jack Begosian?<eos> I came looking for the survivors of the attack at Tayca.<eos> To what end?<eos> The people I work for, they want the world to know the wrong that was done here, and the people who did it charged.
Catch me.<eos> But if your worlds are completely different, these connections will erode, and eventually, I think one will begin to seem more and more like what it is.<eos> A fantasy.<eos> So you think if I am in two different places, one of them will fall apart?<eos> Dreams are our way of processing reality.<eos> If you move, you're processing an entirely different world.<eos> Living in Oregon, your mind will eventually have to let go of L.A.<eos> But understand I think that this is a good thing.<eos> In your dream, you're beginning to recognize, to wrestle with the fact that there comes a point at which you have to move on.<eos> Now, you'll fight it, which is natural.
So, I paid a visit to your therapist's office.<eos> And now I understand.<eos> Can you really not tell if you're awake or asleep?<eos> I bet they've told you that you're crazy.<eos> That you need help.<eos> That you need to get well.<eos> You see, that's the thing about guys like you and me. There's no other way for us to be.<eos> You take away what makes us us, and what's left?<eos> No, don't let them do that to you.<eos> The world needs a few of us to see it... Sideways.
That's it!<eos> Steady!<eos> He's a serious man-- Stannis Baratheon.<eos> They're coming. They're coming ashore.<eos> Rain fire on them.<eos> Archers!<eos> There are too many.<eos> Hound, form a welcome party for any Baratheon troop that manages to touch solid ground.<eos> Pod, run to the King's gate.<eos> Bring any men guarding it here now.
You didn't, though.<eos> You really remember?<eos> You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent.<eos> Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them.<eos> - When I think back to that day... - Shh!<eos> You were saying?<eos> I... Never mind.<eos> It's embarrassing.<eos> More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?<eos> I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon Swann from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me.
Conor was found there.<eos> Square one.<eos> Inspector.<eos> Can I speak to you?<eos> Go on.<eos> I found a notebook... here, in one of the tool stacks.<eos> It was Murray's.<eos> I didn't know what to make of it.<eos> He was always losing things.<eos> And Helena explained it away, said she'd give it to you.
None, none. She...<eos> No, I acted...<eos> At all times, I acted alone.<eos> So you gave Murray the third dose at the arid house?<eos> The first two doses went well.<eos> I got over-confident.<eos> I raised the third dose.<eos> He began fitting almost immediately.<eos> He hit his head as he fell.<eos> So you took the body out of the gardens, you buried it in the woods, you came back to the gardens and cleared up the arid house, while the professor, your lover, who lives in the gardens, saw absolutely nothing?
Any amount would have that effect.<eos> This particular brand activates relatively slowly, but would synergise with the alcohol to speed up the conking out process.<eos> The conking out process being...?<eos> An internationally-recognised medical term.<eos> Ann-Marie.<eos> Is that it?<eos> I've pushed your boat into open water, Robbie.<eos> Get rowing.<eos> You wouldn't have anything for a bad tooth here, would you?<eos> I can take it out if you like.
Lauren... Let's go!<eos> Patricia Hutchison? That's me.<eos> Upstairs, first door on your left.<eos> Fred Mclintock?<eos> Yes.<eos> The hygienist is ready if you just want to pop through.<eos> James?<eos> Gurdip has found Yelland's vase on an online auction website.<eos> It seems the O'Briens are trying to recoup their losses by palming off what they believe to be a fake.<eos> The bids had started to come in so I bought it outright and will collect it at 9am.
She really stepped in on the Phyllis thing.<eos> This will be good for Char.<eos> I mean, no kid should have to shoulder something like that alone. Sure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have either of you guys seen my bracelet? KRISTIN:<eos> No.<eos> I've looked everywhere, and I thought I might have left it on my nightstand or the bathroom, but it's disappeared.<eos> Well, it's a vintage bracelet. It couldn't have cost you much.<eos> Justin gave it to me.<eos> And it was his mother's, and it was a really special gift, so I'm really screwed if I don't find it.
God, Justin, I am so, so sorry. I've looked everywhere for it.<eos> It was the best gift ever, and I know it was your mother's...<eos> It's-It's okay, Laurel.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I'm gonna keep looking for it; I've even got the whole family on the case.<eos> You told them that it was my mother's?<eos> That's okay, right?<eos> She was wearing it the day that she died.<eos> I'm in the hospital, and they come out... and all I see is this plastic bag.<eos> A doctor's holding it. And inside... I can see the bracelet.
I would say, in total, in the region of about ã500,000. Come on, guys!<eos> That's a lot of money.<eos> Well, it's not really expensive when you consider the property is worth over ã2m and she paid under ã1m for it.<eos> It was a very good investment.<eos> God, this is terrible.<eos> I can't believe it. I just...<eos> I can't take in what's happened.<eos> We haven't found many personal items.<eos> Did you find a soft toy?<eos> Amanda used to keep it propped on her pillow.
Somebody wanted to destroy the evidence.<eos> ♪ Out here in the fields<eos> ♪ I fight for my meals<eos> ♪ I get my back into my living<eos> - Sid.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Smell that.<eos> Gasoline.<eos> So now we know what kind of accelerant was used to start the fire.<eos> What kept it burning for so long?
- Hate sex, date sex, pity sex party sex, pity-party sex.<eos> - Bi-curious, by the ocean.<eos> - By the hour.<eos> - The reverse André the Giant.<eos> - No, Tessa's not doing any of that.<eos> She's going to if she hasn't already. And you can't stop her.<eos> I sure can. It's simple.<eos> If I wanna keep Tessa away from boys all I have to do is find something more fun than having sex.<eos> Jenga!<eos> Heh. Take a block from the bottom And you put it on top.

- I have a meeting today.<eos> - Yowza, nice outfit.<eos> You should bring this next time we go somewhere. - Ew. - Ew.<eos> The reporter from the "Kansas City Herald."<eos> - Oh yeah.<eos> - Yeah, she called your mother.<eos> She wants to check in and see how we're doing.<eos> I told Wilke I'd meet him early. So I'm gonna head out.<eos> All right, well,<eos> I'm gonna let her know how we felt about her last article and make sure that she doesn't do it again.
I have a photo-shoot here, with a model.<eos> Why don't you come live with me and just use this apartment as a studio?<eos> What?<eos> No, pal.<eos> Your dad could get a heart attack.<eos> Besides, I'm not much of a commitment person.<eos> What if it doesn't work?<eos> What if it does?<eos> Think about it.<eos> When you agree to it, we will take the pine tree and plant it together.
Lemonade?<eos> — Is it good?<eos> — Really good.<eos> Have a really good spot here.<eos> I know.<eos> Wow.<eos> I know.<eos> Uh, Mister?<eos> — You forgot your change.<eos> — I'm just glad you keep it.
Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses,<eos> "O, sweet, Benedick!<eos> God give me patience!"<eos> I would she had bestowed this dotage on me.<eos> I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself.<eos> I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear what he will say.<eos> Were it good, think you?<eos> Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die, ere she make her love known,<eos> - and she will die if he woo her, - (CRASHES) rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness.<eos> She doth well. If she should make tender of her love 'tis very possible he'll scorn it, for the man, as you know all, - hath a contemptible spirit.
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, so forcible is thy wit.<eos> But I must tell thee plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge and either I will shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe him a coward.<eos> And, I pray thee, now, tell me for which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?<eos> For them all together, which maintained so politic a state of evil that they would not admit any good part to intermingle with them.<eos> But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?<eos> Suffer love!<eos> A good epithet!<eos> I do suffer love, indeed, for I love thee against my will.<eos> In spite of your heart, I think.<eos> If you will spite it for my sake, I will spite it for yours, for I could never love that which my friend hates.
I respect your degree.<eos> I do. But it's not how we're getting out of this situation, okay?<eos> We don't have time to bring in a mediator.<eos> Charlie, I am not going to live with a man who says "fag" and beats up guys on the side of the road.<eos> I'm not gonna teach non-violence at a university and then marry Dog the bounty hunter!<eos> I won't do it!<eos> What are you doing, Gil?<eos> Protecting someone I love.<eos> What are you doing, Yul Perrkins?<eos> I don't know how you know that name, but if you say it out loud again, I swear to God...
I sometimes sneak out here to think.<eos> Does your father know that you called me?<eos> So, what did you wanna tell me, Emily?<eos> I think a lot of people are gonna die.<eos> It started when I was 11.<eos> I was in a pet store with my mother.<eos> We were looking at puppies when suddenly I heard this hum.<eos> I thought something was wrong with my ears. Like, you know how sometimes after you've flown on an airplane?<eos> But then, when we were leaving, the man behind the counter had a heart attack.<eos> I saw it in my mind before it happened.
And then you could love him and be happy.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm just not seeing any connection between the victims.<eos> Secretary's son, he's cute, huh?<eos> I bet he's all contradictory and tricky like his dad.<eos> Yeah, I imagine he's just your type.<eos> Actually, no.<eos> Turns out I like the nice guys.<eos> So neither of the victims lived in the same neighborhood.<eos> They didn't go to the same gym, got no mutual friends.<eos> There has to be a connection. We just haven't found it.
You need a lion's share.<eos> I have to say, you have a fire in your belly.<eos> A fuel that's driving you, motivating you to change.<eos> Most men don't.<eos> Helen, right?<eos> No need to tell me.<eos> A man's dying words carry the weight of either love or loss.<eos> Usually both.<eos> What do you care?<eos> A chicken can do as many pushups as it wants, the fox is still gonna eat it.
Two years ago...<eos> The USS Nautilus passed through the San Francisco bay, spitting distance from this Rock, on its way to the North Pole.<eos> - Is that so?<eos> So, Verne was right.<eos> He's got this other book too, all about man landing on the moon.<eos> The moon?<eos> Now you're talking crazy.<eos> Mark my words... It's comin'.<eos> He kept a jar of bugs in his cell.<eos> Called it his "killing jar."
A billion dollars, Burke.<eos> How many people can say that?<eos> And the garage sale was a total washout until we found--<eos> "The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe" by C.S. Lewis.<eos> Wait, you paid 50 bucks for a used book?<eos> What does it do, shoot lasers?<eos> - It's a first edition.<eos> - I bet I could find it for less.<eos> It doesn't matter what we paid for it because it's our favorite book.<eos> He saw me reading it one day and he said, "You know that's my favorite book."
And I'm so sorry about the ring.<eos> I should have just told you the second I couldn't find it.<eos> I just have no idea who would have taken it.<eos> Well, I thought it was Juliet, but I was wrong.<eos> Regardless, it won't happen again.<eos> I'm putting a new security system in tomorrow.<eos> But at least I got the ring back.<eos> It fits.<eos> I stopped by the jewelers on the way back from the pawnshop.<eos> And from now on, let's put it in the safe if you're not wearing it.

Saw 16 different indictments. Nothing's stuck.<eos> Last time he was convicted was for a petty theft charge almost 20 years ago.<eos> Sounds like someone I know back in Wyoming. Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mason.<eos> Machado?<eos> What do you got?<eos> Body's over there?<eos> It's a few days old, and with the warm weather we've been having, pretty gamy.<eos> They're still digging it out of a shallow grave.
I'm not going anywhere with you.<eos> It needs to look like you are.<eos> It's called improvising, bitch!<eos> So, Siobhan comes home unexpectedly and finds her husband and ex-wife in bed, planning to go away to Mexico.<eos> Gunplay ensues, Andrew is shot dead, I am wounded, and sadly, Siobhan takes her own life.<eos> It is all so tragic.<eos> You're not a killer, Catherine.<eos> Though you have left me no choice!<eos> But you do have a choice.<eos> You just need help. We can get it for you.
It's about time.<eos> [Jake] Bruce's money?<eos> [Jake] Ladies, I think you should probably go now.<eos> [Call girl] That's 600 bucks.<eos> [Jake] I think this one is going to be on Bruce.<eos> [Jake] That should about cover it.<eos> [Call girl] Call again, Wally. Anytime.<eos> [Walter] (Whispers) Oh my God!<eos> [Mal] Didn't take his money with him.<eos> [Jake] Why don't we take the cash, go back to the house and stash it there?
Even better... A thundercat.<eos> What?<eos> - Speaking of which-- - That will be $7.<eos> Where is that thing?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa! That is not for sale.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry, Thurman.<eos> You're just going to have to hand that over.<eos> He did pay full price for it, Shawn.<eos> Well, I'm going to buy it back, Jules.
- No, it isn't.<eos> - I think it's haunted.<eos> - It probably is.<eos> - Gus!<eos> - What?<eos> Shawn.<eos> I've been doing a little more digging into the history of Lassiter's building.<eos> It gets even more weird.<eos> I'm not sure that's even possible.<eos> Prospect Gardens' architect was a man named J. Michael Hageman, who conceived it as his masterpiece.
And it's taken its toll on the people closest to me.<eos> Mr. O'Hara, yes, Shawn has bent the truth on occasion, but he's as decent as they come.<eos> In fact, he's the type of guy I'd want my daughter to bring home... Provided he was mostly black...<eos> - And God-fearing.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And she wasn't really my daughter.<eos> I'll think about that, that's very sweet.<eos> I'll wait for your next call.<eos> - Gus, what happened to my pickle?<eos> - You ate it already.
[Mal] What are you talking about?<eos> [Rose] She never went to school in London. [Mal] She did what?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> [Jake] Who was-- they just took the car!<eos> [Mal] And the body.<eos> Freeze! [Jake] Whoa!<eos> Hands where I can see 'em!<eos> Down on your knees!<eos> [Mal] Alright!<eos> [Leslie] So, you're telling me you found the missing body, you moved it from the crime scene and then you lost it.
Thanks.<eos> So did I, but Jules likes it like this.<eos> I'm the lamest.<eos> Please.<eos> I roll around with strange dogs.<eos> You know, as men, I feel like we're not asking for that much.<eos> I just want her to give me attention when I want it and to leave me alone when I don't want it.<eos> Yeah, like a baby. Exactly.<eos> Just treat me like a baby.<eos> When we want affection, they don't give it to us, but if we don't want it, they come running.
Really?<eos> Totally, but sometimes I do feel, uh, a little, well, what is it?<eos> You're not crazy about the ditzy, trashy, fake blonde, fake tan, fake boob, club skank you one-night-standed to make that baby.<eos> She says it better.<eos> That is not true, Jill.<eos> Your mommy and I had a one-afternoon stand.<eos> Jill?<eos> I thought her name was Tampa.<eos> Yeah. Her mom named her "Tampa," but she let me pick the middle name, so from now on we're calling her "Jill."<eos> I'm gonna stick with "Tampa" 'cause you hate it so much.
I can do it.<eos> Oh, oh! That is vodka!<eos> Oh! Please, sir, just push me in the direction of the theater.<eos> Je suis du Quebec. Damn Quebecers!<eos> Quebecers!<eos> Quebecers!<eos> Quebecers!<eos> The movie's a no-go.<eos> There was a chicken wing disaster.<eos> I will explain it on the way to the bar.
- No. Clean Jobs is one of them.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - My Clean Jobs? - Yeah.<eos> Oh, son of a bitch.<eos> That President, he is a suffocating son of a bitch.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Had we not heard anything about this?<eos> Apparently there were rumblings in the blogs, but...<eos> But why weren't we on it?<eos> They used a nickname, ma'am, and we were not searching on it.
Was that a knife?<eos> More like teeth.<eos> It looks something like a bite mark.<eos> Literally sucking the victim dry.<eos> Are we looking at a revenge killing?<eos> - Victim's never been married, so we ruled out ex-wives.<eos> Current girlfriend's alibi checks out.<eos> Could be an ex. He was a bit of a player.<eos> And the only thing missing was his Rolex.<eos> We got the serial number from the insurance company. - Put it on a hotlist.
- Yeah.<eos> We don't really consider them part of the phylum.<eos> Personally, I'm not a spider fan per se.<eos> I catch one, I wash it down the drain, watch it squirm.<eos> But only if I catch them in the house.<eos> If they're outside, then live and let live, you know?<eos> I found a book, there were some photos in it, but it was mostly written in Japanese.<eos> Japanese?<eos> That's interesting.<eos> Don't expect me to translate it though.
She was meeting me.<eos> What are you doing out here with her?<eos> Just a little business transaction.<eos> What's in the briefcase?<eos> Everything comes at a price.<eos> Land is no different.<eos> That's why you're meeting her out here?<eos> Regina bought your land?<eos> The very ground you're standing on.<eos> - What does she want it for? - You know, in business,
I know you say you don't know what you are, but whatever it is, I gotta say, I'm impressed.<eos> Don't be.<eos> I was scared out of my mind.<eos> But you did it anyway.<eos> You knew?<eos> Of course I knew.<eos> Her mother was one too before a hunting party killed her.<eos> I thought maybe Red didn't get it, but when she was 13, it started.<eos> I paid a wizard for that cloak.<eos> It keeps her from turning, but she doesn't wear it, and she's found some way out of the house.
That.<eos> I guess you caught me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> The toy cart!<eos> Come.<eos> Wouldn't this make the perfect guest for our tea parties, papa?<eos> Can I have him?<eos> Excuse me. How much for the rabbit?<eos> That costs one silver.<eos> Would you take it for 8 coppers?
Oh.<eos> My beautiful boy.<eos> Can you truly, truly forgive me?<eos> I forgive you, papa.<eos> You were looking for the knife.<eos> I thought that if you still had it, it would mean that you hadn't changed.<eos> Well, let's go and find it and see.<eos> I buried it here shortly after Emma came to town.<eos> Things were changing.<eos> Didn't want to take the chance of Regina finding it.
Well, she'd have to be-- all those years skating with the Ice Capades.<eos> Uh... we got a call about a kidnapping. Oh...<eos> Mom and Jody stole my baby from the hospital.<eos> You had your baby?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> It was a fucking horror show, but I... finally had the damn thing.<eos> They stole it, and I want you to take it back.<eos> You don't... want to keep the baby?<eos> It's retarded.<eos> I want it to go back so they can give it away to the Down Syndrome baby do-gooders or the county or whatever.
Ma'am, is the baby in the laundry basket?<eos> Yes.<eos> Give it to the cop, Mom.<eos> Karen, honey, please don't do this. Ah, man.<eos> Look how handsome you are.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Give it to the damn cop, Mom!<eos> So this is your mother, and she wants to take care of the baby?<eos> Yes, but I don't want it here.
Why didn't you just give me permission to look?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm running out of ideas here.<eos> Maybe there's something else in his van he doesn't want you to find.<eos> Isabel, ask to see his wallet.<eos> I'm gonna leave now.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you don't have the right to hold me here.<eos> His wallet, Isabel.<eos> I do have a right to see your identification, and if you don't provide it, I can hold you.
We cleaned and tuned bells.<eos> You can't tune bells.<eos> All right, focus! Girl with a gun in a hurricane.<eos> Sacred mother still rings bells, and there's a methodist place, too.<eos> All right, so we're looking for a church near a yum yum burger that's closer to the oven than the fridge.<eos> What? The... the sponge!<eos> Melissa's backpack.<eos> Melissa finds Renae.<eos> They argue.<eos> Renae takes Melissa's backpack and tosses it down a storm drain.
That was easy.<eos> I mean, do you want me to make it difficult for you? Like...<eos> I don't know, Emily.<eos> I guess you'll have to convince me here.<eos> Really?<eos> I mean... maybe a little convincing, or...<eos> Well, how 'bout now?<eos> Maybe a little more?<eos> Well, now I can show you my apartment.<eos> I'm gonna see it soon enough.
We both married much, much older men, which can be hard, or, more often, flaccid.<eos> I have an idea. Maybe, we just don't talk at all.<eos> Maybe we sit quietly and read our, uh, soccer magazine.<eos> Mr. Jordan's lizard, Jeremy, is always escaping and biting everyone.<eos> Like owner, like lizard. Oh, man.<eos> That's why Mr. Jordan got him a GPS collar.<eos> Now it's easier to find...<eos> Huh, well that can't be.<eos> It says he's inside the room.<eos> Maybe you're reading it wrong?
The sun'll come out, just like the song says.<eos> God, do you know how many years I've prayed for this moment?<eos> I'll be free.<eos> Well, this might not be nice to say, but if anyone deserves cancer, it's your mother.<eos> Frank took her to Sheila's late last night.<eos> She was having trouble breathing.<eos> The chemicals from the fire were aggravating her emphysema.<eos> Will the chemicals give us emphysema?<eos> Probably, but we won't know for 50 years.<eos> Carl, the team gives you one helmet and if you break it, we can't afford to replace it.
I got plenty of duct tape.<eos> Get it.<eos> Thought you dropped out.<eos> Uh, made a deal with Fiona.<eos> She'll blow her end, and I'll be back home chilling in a week.<eos> I'm gonna give the baby up for adoption.<eos> Sometimes I wonder if getting high makes it easier for me to keep up with you or more difficult.<eos> I thought I was in love with Jody;<eos> I'm not. I thought it would be cool to have a baby and love it, but no, I suck at it.<eos> I thought about aborting it, but I'm this far along, and even though I don't want it, other people probably do. So I figure why not suck it up a few more months, vag it out and sell it?
You have made a great choice to honor the budding life inside you.<eos> Time will tell.<eos> I'm sure we'll find the baby a good home.<eos> Can you find me one?<eos> The Catholic couple that we'll place your baby with has most likely struggled to get pregnant, so they are committed to having a family.<eos> Now, um, are... are you limited to, uh, only Catholic families, or can other people apply?<eos> We do attempt to find families of faith first.<eos> Yeah. Cool.<eos> So how much do we get?<eos> We'll be sure to place your baby with parents who can support it.
Exactly. Innocent people find it hard to sort out an alibi.<eos> We haven't served an alibi notice.<eos> No.<eos> What, so we're getting a witness or two together first to corroborate what we haven't yet said?<eos> Precisely.<eos> What about the confession evidence?<eos> You know, I've been at this job for 30 years and my total loathing for the police hasn't changed one little bit.<eos> It's deep and it's savage.<eos> Why?<eos> Because the Government can slash legal aid, knowing that the public will wear it.
Which?<eos> It was just a mention.<eos> I was at the prison to take a proof from my client who wasn't there!<eos> And they all had a very big laugh at my expense, saying didn't I know my client had escaped.<eos> Big bloody joke and me looking like a tosser!<eos> We didn't know...<eos> Don't like "don't know"!<eos> I want a clerk who knows.<eos> There is only one hymn sheet, it is mine.<eos> I give it to you and you make totally bloody sure it's Onward Christian Soldiers that everyone is singing!
She's joking, right?<eos> No.<eos> Jill.<eos> This should be a quick procedure. Take your time, doctor.<eos> Money's no object.<eos> We're not paid by the hour.<eos> Well, even if you were, I would say take all the time that you need.<eos> She's worth every penny.<eos> Our main concern is that the break heals cleanly.<eos> So we'll re-break the nose and set it properly.
The nomads did it.<eos> First, they shot Pasha.<eos> Pasha?<eos> They shot the dog as well?<eos> - Weird.<eos> - Where did you find the rifle?<eos> - Did you get it from my side?<eos> - l told you, I found it by the rocks.<eos> How did it get there?<eos> - Someone left it there.
I'm fucking deangelo now.<eos> Rodney, deangelo. You go through these guys like goddamn disposable something.<eos> Yeah, well, to this delicious hag, they are disposable.<eos> Mother, love is a thing to be cherished.<eos> You find love, you better hold on for dear life.<eos> Well, Jefferson, last night,<eos> I grabbed onto deangelo's cock, brought it in my mouth, and held on for dear life.<eos> That's how you want to talk to your son?<eos> You think I want to hear my own mother say, "last night, I"<eos> grabbed onto deangelo's cock and put it in my mouth"?
You could shave me bald as a cue ball, and I'll still be the hottest tamale in this joint.<eos> Take her to the common room so the others can witness her newfound immaculacy.<eos> And next time, knock.<eos> Remind me of your name. Lana.<eos> Lana Winters.<eos> Can I ask what Shelly did?<eos> I assume you were punishing her for something.<eos> I assumed you were here to do a story on our bakery.<eos> Oh, believe me, no one loves that molasses bread more than I do.<eos> I toast it for my breakfast every single morning.
So not only is Lisa Hill married, she is also an heiress...<eos> Daughter to Stephanie Dashby.<eos> Of Dashby Publishing?<eos> Which puts her in Forbes top 400.<eos> Bailey was hunting big game.<eos> He knew he couldn't close the deal as a junior analyst, that's why he used the alias with her, same way he used it with big-shot lawyer Holly Franklin.<eos> Yeah, well, according to her maid, Lisa Hill packed up and left her apartment for her house in montauk at 6:30 P.M.<eos> Half an hour after our kill zone.<eos> Plus she also had easy access to our poison.<eos> Her sister owns a drug company that manufactures it.
Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, Adam I got you a little gift.<eos> In lieu of a fee, I guess.<eos> I love presents.<eos> Wow.<eos> I can have it?<eos> I can't.<eos> Hospital rules.<eos> And, yes... I want you to have it.
- What if she wants to put him in a home?<eos> - Might be the best thing.<eos> - He wants to stay.<eos> So did my mother, even after she started shitting in the kitchen drawers.<eos> Hey, what about you and me, we chip in, we buy the bar?<eos> - What?<eos> - it'll give him money... - ... for round-the-clock care.<eos> - Not interested.<eos> When he goes, someone's gonna buy this place.<eos> What if they turn it into a Friday's?
- it'll give him money... - ... for round-the-clock care.<eos> - Not interested.<eos> When he goes, someone's gonna buy this place.<eos> What if they turn it into a Friday's?<eos> - I look good in stripes.<eos> - We buy the bar from Stan he gets to stay and we keep our jobs.<eos> - No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I like making my 100 bucks a night, skimming a few dollars off the top. Then going home and not thinking about this place until I come back.<eos> - Fine, I'll buy it myself.
I gotta go to the bar and blow up my beach balls.<eos> Hey, Dots.<eos> It's me.<eos> You ready?<eos> Dottie, why aren't you dressed?<eos> This is our big day.<eos> Chop, chop, city hall awaits.<eos> I was watching the news.<eos> There was an accident on I-494 yesterday.<eos> Why don't you tell me about it on the bus ride down to city hall?
Before you put her in the coma, was she talking again'?<eos> Yes, she was, and that's a good sign.<eos> What'd she say?<eos> Did she mention the name "Andy"?<eos> No, she only said that I had very pretty eyelashes.<eos> She's right.<eos> Your eyelashes are quite lush.<eos> - What about the bullet?<eos> - it's in there.<eos> We're gonna leave it in for now.
- Are you sure?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Because she always does what the men in her life tell her to do?<eos> Shall we have our fight about bail?<eos> "Do not contact any member of your family directly or indirectly "or you will be remanded in custody. " Quote, unquote.<eos> It is a kind of arrogance, frankly, to ignore a judicial warning of such clarity.<eos> Does she think the law doesn't apply to her?<eos> There's a cultural problem here, your honour.<eos> Fatima has failed to understand that what the judge says has to take precedence over her profound need to talk to her family. She gets it now.<eos> I've explained it to her in no uncertain terms.
Yeah, we sing to Lily... All of the time. Mm.<eos> I wish I could hear you guys.<eos> Oh, well, that's very sweet.<eos> No, now.<eos> The baby's father is a musician, and I would love to know that he's growing up in a musical household.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Great.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now we are actually doing a song and dance.<eos> Okay, well, look at it this way-- we're not only adopting a baby, we're saving it from a life spent searching for east Dakota.
Doug Stanley, security guard.<eos> He's been hunting a thief who's been stealing jewelry out of women's apartments.<eos> Maybe Trask is the thief planning to kill Doug, to cover his crimes.<eos> Or Trask knows who the thief is and now they're planning to kill him.<eos> That's the landlord, Alan Holt.<eos> Doesn't look like Trask is the employee of the month.<eos> Maybe he's about to snap and kill his boss?<eos> Why did the machine give us his number?<eos> Is Trask in trouble... Or is he the problem?<eos> Well, you're not gonna get it staring at the wall. We need to do some legwork.
Nathan, you remember Deputy Director Weeks.<eos> The man in charge. I hope I'm not in trouble.<eos> The nine digits you gave us are the social security number of a man named Gordon Kurzweil.<eos> He's one of ours.<eos> He's a DIA case officer. Top secret clearance.<eos> Been acing FBI background checks for 20 years.<eos> We surveilled Kurzweil for two weeks, got nothing.<eos> And just when we were thinking that you'd sold us a bill of goods, he breaks pattern.<eos> Goes for a drive. At a park in Bethesda, a Syrian businessman drops his phone.<eos> Kurzweil picks it up, and via coded SMS, he arranges to sell 26 pounds of weapons-grade uranium to the iranian government.
And you told this to Garrett.<eos> I never should've opened up to him.<eos> I was just venting, trying to sort through my feelings.<eos> - This is not good.<eos> - Why? Melissa, we're not the only people who know about Jason.<eos> Dad might've been blackmailed.<eos> What?<eos> By who?<eos> Alison. Jason found cash, a lot of it.<eos> Ali was hiding it, and I asked Dad about it.
"N-neat"?<eos> Jerry, it's a knife.<eos> You got me a knife... Again.<eos> You didn't look at it, did you?<eos> Sure.<eos> It's... great.<eos> And if you ever celebrate your 3-year anniversary with Chris, it'll be the perfect gift.<eos> Okay then.<eos> Jer--<eos> - Wasn't sure how you took it.
Keep it safe.<eos> You are staying long in Cloisterham?<eos> No, no.<eos> Back to London as soon as I can.<eos> I am an awkward species of a man, with no experience of such delights, but I figure to myself, subject to your correction, Mr Edwin, that the true lover is ever impatient to be close to the object of his affections, seeking her company as a bird seeks its nest.<eos> I do write to her in between visits.<eos> Although I'm an engineer, not a poet.<eos> You will notice from your perusal of Rosa's father's will, a kindly allusion to a little trust, confided to me in conversation, to discharge at such time as I in my discretion may think best.<eos> This ring was removed from the dead hand of Rosa's mother, in my presence.<eos> Your placing it on her daughter's finger... will be the most solemn seal upon your love.
There's a threat to young men named Ned.<eos> Only one man calls me Ned.<eos> There's the man who's picked your rosebud.<eos> Mr Neville?<eos> A fine weapon.<eos> Now I come into a walking country, I need a walking stick.<eos> Cudgel, more like!<eos> It's much too heavy.<eos> Is it ironwood?<eos> Don't wave it in my direction.
Your credit cards. Basically everything you have he tapped into.<eos> Great.<eos> Don't worry about it. I'm currently straightening it out with the banks and the credit card companies.<eos> Just my way of giving you guys on the inside a second chance.<eos> Is that all you got?<eos> No-- well, no. I- - I-<eos> - I hacked into, um, Jake's phone-- Well, Rodney's phone-<eos> - Well, Jake's phone-<eos> - Whatever, your phone, and he made, like, a hundred calls out of a warehouse by the airport.<eos> They're using it as a garage.
'Herr Von Ribbentrop, the German Foreign Minister, 'is en route to Moscow where he will meet Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov 'to ratify the treaty.<eos> 'Lord Halifax will shortly be addressing the cabinet...'<eos> I thought Fascists and Communists were meant to hate each other?<eos> Your enemy's enemy can sometimes be your friend.<eos> So does this mean that it's definite?<eos> There's going to be a war?<eos> Looks that way.<eos> Better polish my boots then.<eos> What about the ball, Mr P?<eos> Will they cancel it?
How much do I owe you?<eos> This one's on us.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, it's not.<eos> We charge a fee now at infeld-daniels.<eos> I want 12 wheels of your camembert.<eos> You got it.<eos> And I'm gonna throw in my suit for you.<eos> Sarcasm.<eos> I got two lawyers I want to recommend to you. Yeah?<eos> Why don't you make a hockey stick Out of some parmesan and shove it up your ass? !
You are a good girl.<eos> You're a born radical... unsurprisingly.<eos> Listen.<eos> I think it's probably best if you don't say anything to Nat... about the times with Rosa on the boat, and so on.<eos> I'm sure we'd agree on this.<eos> ...prematurely or unnecessarily... risk the cost of worldwide nuclear war... in which even the fruits of victory would be ashes in our mouth.<eos> But neither will we shrink from that risk... at any time it must be faced.<eos> I have directed the armed forces to prepare for any eventualities.<eos> It shall be the policy of this nation... to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba... against any nation in the Western Hemisphere... as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States... requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union.<eos> The cost of freedom is always high... but Americans have always paid it.
That's me!<eos> You can't wear your street shoes in the office.<eos> You got nails in the soles? You get sparks.<eos> Those are some gruesome twosomes.<eos> Now your ring.<eos> This is my engagement ring.<eos> I don't care if it's the Hope Diamond.<eos> Those are the rules-- no cigarettes, no lighters, nothing that can spark.<eos> You'll get it back at shift's end.<eos> I'll leave it at home tomorrow.
You can't smoke in here, but there's an area outside.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Do you guys have a light?<eos> Did you start smoking before the assaults or after?<eos> Before.<eos> Why?<eos> Yes, Vanessa smokes. What does it matter?<eos> It might explain how the unsub is drugging these women.<eos> The media has done a very good job of warning people to watch their drinks so that bars are no longer a fertile hunting ground, but cigarette smokers aren't as careful.<eos> They might ask to have a cigarette from a stranger or have their pack swapped out of their purse when they put it down and then unknowingly inhale PCP or Scopolamine, both of which mimic the effects of date rape drugs.
I mean, I think about Henry... All the time. I talk about him all the time, too, until, you know,<eos> I'm sure that people don't want to hear another word. But I really, I-- Really, I can't help it.<eos> No, listen, it's fine.<eos> You should enjoy him.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> Sam was over this morning.<eos> I was asking him for some parenting advice. And he said the exact same thing. "Just enjoy him."<eos> Well, that's kind of ironic.<eos> What, the two of you giving the same advice?<eos> That you're asking it from Sam.
And I'm sorry.<eos> I loved your mother.<eos> So did I.<eos> And I'm sure she was very proud of you.<eos> What, are you just, like, saying that... to make up for all the school plays and the piano recitals that you missed?<eos> Because I didn't do any of those, if that makes you feel any better.<eos> I'm saying that because I knew your mother as well as anyone. And you are exactly the daughter that we always dreamed of.<eos> Cassie, you have to give me the medallion.<eos> - What?<eos> - As long as you have it, the spirits it contained will come after you.
If a Blake and a Conant what?<eos> How am I dragged into this?<eos> The curse is someone in the circle could die.<eos> Whatever it is, we will find a way to keep it from spreading.<eos> Took a curse to figure out being with Adam was a colossal mistake?<eos> Hey.<eos> I think I found the way to fix this.<eos> This is a recipe for an elixir that Amelia tracked down.<eos> I think this'll break the curse.<eos> If she had an elixir, why didn't she use it?
And I might not be your father, but I'm here, too, ok?<eos> Hey, there.<eos> Hey.<eos> I got your text.<eos> You ok?<eos> I need to take a break from the circle for a little while.<eos> What?<eos> I just... I feel like I'm suffocating, like the circle is taking over every part of my existence.<eos> You are the circle, Diana.<eos> I mean, you're the one who started it, who guided the rest of us.
Not exactly.<eos> That one's dead.<eos> I--I might have tested it.<eos> Where did you find this?<eos> In my mom's purse. Ok.<eos> So now, we just have to find Adam's family's crystal.<eos> But it didn't appear on the map.<eos> It must be cloaked.<eos> Adam's grandfather could've spelled and hidden it before he died.<eos> What if we can't find it?
I--I might have tested it.<eos> Where did you find this?<eos> In my mom's purse. Ok.<eos> So now, we just have to find Adam's family's crystal.<eos> But it didn't appear on the map.<eos> It must be cloaked.<eos> Adam's grandfather could've spelled and hidden it before he died.<eos> What if we can't find it?<eos> We have to.<eos> Maybe your grandfather left a clue that might help us figure out his cloaking spell or at least give us an idea of where he hid it.

What the hell?<eos> The crystal!<eos> It's gone.<eos> We totally got out-magicked in our own magic house.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> It was witch hunters.<eos> There's ash around the whole house.<eos> But the crystal was stolen using magic.<eos> It must've been the traitor witch.<eos> And why would the traitor want it?
We know the traitor wasn't bringing the crystal to the hunters, which means he was on his own.<eos> We can track it and bring it back.<eos> Wait.<eos> If Isaac turned on Eben, maybe Ian and the others who were loyal to Isaac can be convinced to turn, too.<eos> A truce? Really?<eos> Don't you remember how that worked out for our parents?<eos> Maybe annihilation isn't the only way to stop this war.<eos> Let's just find the crystal.<eos> Putting together the crystal skull gives us leverage either way.<eos> Even if we find it, how are we going to get the crystal away from the traitor?
So if you've got any kick-ass magic you've been hiding, now would be the time to whip it out.<eos> Ahh! Faye?<eos> Faye!<eos> Get off me.<eos> She's on the ferry.<eos> - Is Diana with her?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Look, I know you wish you could've done more to stop what happened 16 years ago.<eos> Please, let's not let it happen again.<eos> Your power was destroyed when we stripped it.
They confirmed - that the manifest was accurate.<eos> - Okay. So either the hijackers got scared and bailed, or whatever they were looking for wasn't in here.<eos> Well, there certainly were plenty of ripe targets on board. Yeah?<eos> It's not the only thing they left behind.<eos> Check this out.<eos> The print Kono found came back to our delivery driver, Lee Dolan.<eos> The blood matches our victim, Carl Hodge.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Carl was killed instantly.<eos> I mean, the only way his blood could have gotten back into the cargo hold is if Lee transferred it incidentally after the attack.
Is he cleaning house?<eos> Is he going to say anything to anyone about anything?<eos> - About me?<eos> - Just leave it alone.<eos> You know what this place doesn't need?<eos> A tip jar.<eos> We're raising funds for our friends who no longer have an income.<eos> - Do you have an income?<eos> - I do.<eos> All right, we'll put it in the supply room.
What's wrong?<eos> Are you in labor?<eos> No, I just need a moment to myself.<eos> Me, too.<eos> It's horrible out there.<eos> Oh, yep.<eos> Ekebwe and Cruz got it covered.<eos> You know, you haven't told me the name of the baby.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm worried that if I do and you love it, then I shall start to hate it.
She was good at surprises.<eos> Mum said there's no terror in the world like fathoms of dark water underneath you.<eos> Once you've beaten that, nothing scares you.<eos> Illegal to swim in reservoirs.<eos> It's only trespass.<eos> How did your mam like to work?<eos> Longhand?<eos> Computer?<eos> Laptop.<eos> She used it for everything.
For what?<eos> You gonna send some boys round to help me get it off before the landlord sees?<eos> Why are you here, anyway?<eos> To talk about Michael Morgan.<eos> What did you think of him?<eos> I thought that he was... unhealthy.<eos> Unhealthy?<eos> Manipulative.<eos> Calculating.<eos> He had power and he used it.
Are you telling me how to do my job?<eos> I'm just asking if we could have done things different.<eos> Fine line, Sergeant.<eos> Very fine line.<eos> Kenny! Bag!<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Why's everyone so bloody quiet?<eos> We're trawling through Jenny Lister's home computer files for where she might have backed up her book.<eos> Michael Morgan.<eos> Any mention of that man's name and I want to know about it.
"If you print that, I'll tell the world we were sleeping together."<eos> We're not sure Morgan's the "someone" Jenny shouldn't have been seeing.<eos> And look what she wrote - exploitative, manipulative, controlling.<eos> Why have anything to do with him?<eos> What's the connection?<eos> What's the connection between Jenny Lister and Michael Morgan?<eos> Mattie Jones.<eos> Both drowned.<eos> The laptop.<eos> They both had it in their possession.

What... I love my husband!<eos> I love him!<eos> I don't know about anybody else, but I believe him.<eos> He's going to kill us.<eos> Maybe this happens to you all the time, but it's new to me.<eos> I fell in love with this man over this food 6 years ago.<eos> Your food. Your restaurant.<eos> I still love him.<eos> Thank you for this, Joe. For not giving up on us.<eos> And if this truly is the last time I get to eat this food, or hold my husband's hand, I would just appreciate it if you all would just shut the hell up and let me enjoy it!
You... also look good. Yeah.<eos> That sounds really convincing with a big pause in the middle.<eos> Honestly? I'm not sure about the beard.<eos> Everyone hates the beard.<eos> Yeah, I mean, Flynn even put a bounty on it.<eos> £50 to the person that shaves me while I'm sleeping.<eos> How's he doing, by the way?<eos> What's with the cast?<eos> He's lost the arm now.<eos> It's OK, he's using it as a chat-up line.
This job, it's... It's my passion, and I can't imagine doing, or being, anything else.<eos> And honestly, I'd still go every day even if they weren't paying me $34,000 a year.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> What?<eos> You're making more than I am.<eos> Exactly, which is why...<eos> It has to stop. No.<eos> No, Ben. Please.<eos> I love this job so much and...<eos> I know you love it.
Dr. House is obviously brilliant.<eos> Well, I think we've heard enough.<eos> But Dr. House is also a fiasco.<eos> If I were to exonerate him, condone his completely reckless, immature, almost misanthropic behavior, I would essentially be sending a message to all the other doctors in this hospital that it's okay to act that way, and... Sorry.<eos> - We're in the middle of something.<eos> I mean, he wasn't the nicest doctor I've ever met.<eos> Well, I think we've heard enough.<eos> But he was right.<eos> They found the tumor.<eos> They are removing it, and they are starting plasmapheresis.
Yeah, House is doing this because of his great love of structure, not because he wants us to turn on each other.<eos> So, don't do that.<eos> It makes sense to have someone in there with a little more accountability.<eos> As long as it's not Adams.<eos> She sees the whole thing as an opportunity to remake the department in her image.<eos> Or Park, for obvious reasons.<eos> And Taub's got the kids. He's pretty busy.<eos> Are you seriously angling for a job that you mocked as fake the whole time I had it?<eos> I don't want the job.<eos> You just don't want anyone else to have it.
Attention, passengers...<eos> You have to lift up the sign so he can see it.
And you're doing this because you're dying?<eos> I'm doing this because I have nothing left to lose.<eos> So when you were living, you did nothing for anyone and didn't care. Now that you're dying, you're willing to help a virtual stranger.<eos> Which means you're a better person dying than you ever were living.<eos> And the world's a better place because I didn't save you.<eos> Which makes me wonder why I'm about to tell you, you're not symmetrical.<eos> What's your point?<eos> That you cared about him more than you cared about yourself?<eos> You cared about the puzzle more than you cared about yourself.<eos> If I kept it to myself, then it would just be a puzzle.
Those finches came down that chimney in fury, as if they wanted everyone in the house dead.<eos> Just...just bring your voice down.<eos> Down at least three notes.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Take a deep breath and then say the whole of that speech, without taking a breath.<eos> Those finches came down that chimney in fury, as if they wanted everyone in the house dead.<eos> See?<eos> Acting's not so hard.<eos> I usually go for something a little less pink.<eos> I like this colour.<eos> I want you to wear it every day.
How is that possible?<eos> We grew close during our sessions together.<eos> Natalie told me things that she didn't tell anyone else, like the fact that she was seeing someone in secret.<eos> Why would she need a dating service if she was already seeing someone?<eos> She met him during our sessions together.<eos> That must have been some time ago.<eos> Ten months, but Natalie was still seeing him when she died.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> How?<eos> I know true love when I see it.
CBI.<eos> We need a word.<eos> Screw your word, man.<eos> You needn't look so glum, Lisbon.<eos> If anything happens, you're not gonna be held responsible.<eos> Because that's what I'm worried about.<eos> You know why she's doing this.<eos> To try and escape, most likely.<eos> Yet you're going through with it anyway.<eos> Are you doing this because you need Erica's help or because you want it?
He was, like, obsessed.<eos> Dude, I'm thinking that maybe that painting could be...<eos> An original Hitler. Yes!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Holy shit, dude, this is huge!<eos> We are gonna become famous treasure hunters.<eos> I'm thinking, Hollywood is gonna make a Da Vinci Code style thriller about us!<eos> I can finally be Indiana Jones!<eos> Yeah, yeah, and then I get it back on my wall! Yeah.<eos> Well, we're not gonna put it back up on your wall. It'll probably go in a museum.
Did Tanner say what he thought Mr. Quarles' intentions might be?<eos> Just that he's some water-walking badman from Detroit, come down here to get things running right, like they used to.<eos> You know, if I didn't know better, I'd say Tanner got himself a little old crush.<eos> Mighty fine work, girl.<eos> Mighty fine.<eos> Now, you keep your ear to the ground, and remember I'm counting on you.<eos> You remember that guy in New Jersey, had that crematorium?<eos> Funeral director.<eos> Finish the service, and then he'd call in his cutters, and they'd harvest everything out of the body that was worth anything, and they'd throw the rest of it in the incinerator.<eos> And the human body, when you sell it on the black market like that, I mean, you're talking about a quarter of a million dollars.
Give me an amen!<eos> Give me an amen!<eos> Give me a goddamn amen!<eos> Amen.<eos> What, are you saying you got something better?<eos> I guaran-damn-tee it.<eos> "Guarantee's" a big word.<eos> You ain't the first to come along, making promises.<eos> Yes, but I am the first who can actually deliver.<eos> You see, I have the resources and the infrastructure to turn your shitty little project, or whatever the hell you call it, into a moneymaking machine.
Hey, I have the lead on this.<eos> I've had the lead on this thing since we left Boston.<eos> Gladys-Alpha-unlock.<eos> Initiate protocol 271-Z-X-T now.<eos> Voiceprint verified.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> All right.<eos> Tommy and Barbara Madsen, owners of the "Gold to be Sold" empire. Now, Nate, had you let me run the con, you would know -- Had I let you run it?<eos> You said you were taking the lead --<eos> If you let me run the con from the beginning, you would have found out that the Madsens melt down their daily intake of gold and ship it out to their brokers at the end of every day.
You know where it is. Lead me there. Ow!<eos> Ow! Stephanie, help!<eos> Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet.<eos> I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Excuse me, sir, on the Dunder-Mifflin A-team?<eos> Excuse me, sir?<eos> I'm sure you're just checking your Grindr account.<eos> But, you can't check smart phones during trivia, it's against the rules.<eos> Okay, I'm turning it off.
Will you at least tell her we love her and we're here for her?<eos> I'll be sure to relay the message.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Who were you, uh, talking to?<eos> Just the men installing my ramp.<eos> Now how about I make us some lunch?<eos> No, you've gotta deliver that cement tomorrow.<eos> Look, I don't know why Ben didn't pay you, but I drove back to the site.<eos> I'm gonna find your check, and I'll get it to you tonight.
So what are you gonna do with all this time to yourself?<eos> Oh, that is a problem I look forward to solving.<eos> Bye, Paige.<eos> Thank you!<eos> I spoke with your doctor, and I know.<eos> What?<eos> Doctors aren't allowed to talk about patients' conditions.<eos> Well, they can if you're family, mom.<eos> Why didn't you tell anyone the cancer's back?<eos> Because this time, I ain't gonna beat it.
"To how you'll wear your hair."<eos> Pigtails, ponytail, pixie.<eos> - Okay, so you CGI. - Yeah, we CGI that on you.<eos> So you're watching yourself in the mirror for how many seconds?<eos> - Six seconds. - Six seconds<eos> - while that happens. - Okay, follow me.<eos> - No, right now.<eos> - Then your line.<eos> "So it's nice when there's no choice."<eos> And you go to the refrigerator and open it.
The overture is about to start.<eos> You cross your fingers and hold your heart.<eos> It's curtain time and away we go.<eos> Another op'nin', another op'nin of another show.<eos> Let's see that cue.<eos> Oh, bloody hell!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Still working on that transition?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've been looking at this for so long, I can't even see it anymore.
Bring it in.<eos> Okay...and stop.<eos> He said "I love you"?<eos> It was a shred offhand, but he definitely said it.<eos> You got any plans for Derek's birthday tomorrow?<eos> We're just going to go out for dinner.<eos> - Got a nice dress?<eos> - A very nice dress.<eos> Excuse me, did you say it was Derek's birthday tomorrow?<eos> Okay, we'll be taking it from the top, please.
I came here for you.<eos> Michael, we agreed...<eos> I know what we agreed, and I meant it, but I knew when they sent for me,<eos> I-I knew you would never have done that if you weren't... A-and you just keep ignoring me?<eos> Michael, no.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I didn't want you here.<eos> I didn't want you here.<eos> I told everyone.<eos> I was ready to walk away from the show when I heard you were doing it.
I was just listening.<eos> And that means that there's still a question for the rest of our lives.<eos> How can I... If that's still there?<eos> I wanna trust you, but I can't do it.<eos> Other things will be there too.<eos> That we created.<eos> Maybe that's all we can do.<eos> Just know that the good is more than the mistakes.<eos> I got us lunch.<eos> It's so greasy, mom, you're gonna love it.
Don't tell her that yet.<eos> Oh, don't be that way!<eos> I love you, man.<eos> Whoa, is this silk?<eos> You're like a king-size waterbed in a fancy hotel.<eos> I will never forgive you for this.<eos> Remind me I got your silk pajama top in my locker.<eos> And you'll be happy to know grandma was able to get all my vomit out of it.<eos> You know what?<eos> Why don't you keep it?
Ginnie Newberger had blonde hair, blonder than yours.<eos> And curls down her back that ended just at her bra strap.<eos> Susan... I know you're here.<eos> I can smell you.<eos> Ginnie wore a white blouse, with different colored skirts!<eos> Can you hear me, class?<eos> Ginnie... 400 dreams.<eos> She kept them in a journal.<eos> Nighttime dreams, with dates and times.<eos> She carried it around with her so her parents wouldn't find it.
Guys, the patient's name is Marla Sands.<eos> She was brought in on the 21st with nausea, fatigue, weakness and vomiting.<eos> Susan. - Would you like to do the honors?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Mrs. Sands, this is gonna take care of your nausea, okay?<eos> I find that if you pinch the patient's arm, they barely feel a thing.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I'm sorry. - Oh, geez, I got it.<eos> If you drop it, they won't feel it at all.
Each of these patients was in a coma when they were discharged. - Right.<eos> - I was just trying to figure out why.<eos> I need you to sign this.<eos> Is security here to keep people out or to keep us in?<eos> - Dr. Stark.<eos> - Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is a disciplinary - hearing, Dr. Stark.<eos> - Memorial has a problem.<eos> Wheeler here has identified it.
No kidding?<eos> Yeah. I call it "Accu-Crack."<eos> Catchy.<eos> Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Only problem is there's a caulking gun, a reggae band and a porn site with the same name.<eos> Why don't you just change the name?<eos> Mm- - I would, but I already printed out 30,000 brochures.<eos> Well, tell me about the product. How does it work?<eos> Oh, really, really simple. It's two hard rubber balls attached to a stick that you lay on and move up and down your spine.<eos> How is that high-tech?<eos> Uh... we'd sell it over the Internet?
You're the wind beneath my wings.<eos> - Brock...<eos> - I... like what you did.<eos> That was good singing.<eos> You don't have a little rat face, you opposite of a turd with eyes.<eos> Why are you messing with perfection, Jack?<eos> You need to remember that reality television is formulaic before you get us canceled.<eos> Because I will not go back to putting hair extensions on dogs.<eos> Easy, d'Fwan.<eos> Yeah, we have a problem, but we're going to get through it, 'cause we're family.
So that's why you've been so happy and distracted lately.<eos> The joy of movement, exercise, 10% off arena snacks with your torch card.<eos> And who figured the whole thing out?<eos> The man who knows me better than I know myself.<eos> Pull over here, please.<eos> This is me.<eos> Ah, going to the movies.<eos> You're going alone, to the 9:10 showing of Garry Marshall's New Year's Eve.<eos> You've waited five weeks to see it, to make sure that you wouldn't contribute to it being the number one movie in America.<eos> You'll say you're seeing it ironically, and yet you'll tear up when Ashton Kutcher - kisses Lea Michele.
It's not even the first time that's happened to me.<eos> I must be sending out some kind of signal or something.<eos> Must be it.<eos> Who knew?<eos> Look...<eos> I just wanna make sure, you know, Teddy doesn't...<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Your secret is safe with me.<eos> You're a true friend.<eos> Look all you want, you won't find it. My name. I'm sitting the next flight out.
Look, kid, the whole "monsters in the forest" thing is just local legend drummed up by guys like me to sell merch to guys like that.<eos> So quit being so paranoid!<eos> Grunkle Stan.<eos> Nobody ever believes anything I say.<eos> What the...?<eos> "It's hard to believe it's been six years since I began studying the strange and wondrous secrets of Gravity Falls, Oregon."<eos> What is all this?<eos> "Unfortunately, my suspicions have been confirmed.<eos> "I'm being watched.<eos> "I must hide this book before he finds it.

Yeah.<eos> Gerald Branson, FBI.<eos> 24-hour presumption says if our kidnappers stay in state, NYPD takes the lead.<eos> But if you're okay with it, we'd like to pitch in.<eos> We have monitoring technology that'll help, if and when these kidnappers try to communicate again. We can use all the help we can get.<eos> These your guys?<eos> Nah, these two are personal security detail.<eos> They say Mr. Seville called them himself.<eos> According to the house attendant, nobody saw who delivered that package.<eos> Somebody just left it on the stoop and walked away.
Do you know what the subject is for most best-selling novels?<eos> The subject of serial killing.<eos> It's a moneymaker.<eos> So I opened this store for fans of the macabre.<eos> Right. Selling locks of Charlie Manson's hair.<eos> Your Web site says that you offer soil samples from Lambert Jones' backyard, where he supposedly buried his victims.<eos> As a matter of fact, we do, and for an extra five bucks, I will gift wrap the Lambert dirt for you.<eos> Need I remind you, it is not illegal to sell dirt.<eos> No, it's just immoral and kind of despicable, not for nothing.<eos> Someone gathers it for me, and I only sell it.
"For God's sake. Can't you control your woman?"<eos> Well, it didn't say it was private.<eos> "You are more trouble to me than all the rest of my command put together."<eos> Give me the rhyme-words for a sonnet.<eos> That's the scheme of it.<eos> I know what a damn sonnet is.<eos> What's your game?<eos> Give me 14 end-rhymes of a sonnet and I'll write a sonnet.<eos> In two and a half minutes.<eos> If you do, I'll translate it into Latin hexameters in under three minutes.
Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.<eos> A beautiful monster cost me my 40s and my dream home.<eos> I think I'm entitled to the occasional bad day.<eos> Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.<eos> Dude, what if, since you're feeling grumpy, we all swing by tonight<eos> - and check out your indoor pool? - Kevin, no.<eos> What, as some sort of last hoorah?<eos> All of us in the pool, saying hoorah.<eos> Maybe the last one that says hoorah is it.<eos> You know? I suppose someone should enjoy the place before I hand it over to the staging experts at Remax tomorrow. Let's try this.
June 22nd, 1996, Brooklyn, New York.<eos> A man misses his daughter's high school graduation.<eos> Later, she discovers her babysitting money has been spent on a board game called<eos> Who Stole The Babysitting Money?<eos> He never saw the irony in that.<eos> December 31st, 2011.<eos> A woman calls her father to tell him she's pregnant.<eos> says, 'Great. Thanks,' and hangs up on her.<eos> And after pushing her to call him, a Big Foot is discovered in her husband's mouth.<eos> I'm glad you're a believer, baby, but I'm never gonna believe in an "enigma of the mystical" unless I see it with my own eyes.
I'll... I'll fix it. I'll just go grab a needlepoint kit from my hope chest.<eos> That would be a lot funnier if you didn't have a hope chest.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> I'm back for less than a day, and already you have me in your Frankenstein's laboratory.<eos> Okay.<eos> Clench. Unclench.<eos> Clench.<eos> Unclench.<eos> I know it seems excessive, but thallium poisoning can cause muscle contractures.<eos> The... the metal builds up in soft tissue and weakens it.
I'm not complaining, but did you know a few of those answers are wrong?<eos> I didn't want to "red flag" you.<eos> No one would buy it if you went from being a "c" student to full-immersion overnight.<eos> You still only know one language.<eos> I'm just saying I can't imagine some dude sitting through a billion hours of footage just to find a few minutes of good stuff.<eos> What a pain in the ass.<eos> Are you on it?<eos> Have you been cross-dressing in the sanctuary?<eos> - Yeah. Can I borrow your thong again?<eos> - As long as you hand-wash it.
Will help out financially.<eos> Being a surrogate is noble, but it's a business.<eos> You're a professional, Dr. Montgomery.<eos> You must recognize that I have a valuable skill set that I want to put to work for you.<eos> Hello. Hey.<eos> How'd it go with the surrogate?<eos> Mm.<eos> She's very... Businesslike.<eos> Well, that's good, right? Mm.<eos> No, I mean, you want her to carry the child and give it to you, not be the mother.
What's up?<eos> I know about the tumor.<eos> - What? - I know.<eos> How?<eos> I just...<eos> I know.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> I do.<eos> You need help. No.<eos> What I need is time, and I'm not gonna waste it chasing some cure that doesn't exist.
Let's move.<eos> Keep moving.<eos> Two coming out.<eos> Let's go, Herrmann.<eos> Second floor, clear the doors.<eos> Fire department!<eos> Anyone here? Hey. Slow breaths.<eos> Okay?<eos> Elevator one is clear!<eos> Something's keeping it open.
He wouldn't want us to give up on him.<eos> I have butterflies.<eos> New heart.<eos> Pretty big deal.<eos> - I heard Dr. Bell is petitioning... - Not the time.<eos> You see me.<eos> - Ohh. They're taking my heart, man.<eos> You won't need it.<eos> The big risk is that the body could reject the heart.<eos> The immune system sees it as a foreign object and starts fighting it immediately.
- Let me look. Let me look.<eos> Just hold that.<eos> There.<eos> There's the tear.<eos> Okay, give me a 4-0 prolene.<eos> A longer needle driver!<eos> - I can't reach it with that!<eos> - Give her an 8-inch. He's got no blood pressure.<eos> Okay, come on, Kyle.<eos> - I can't see it from this angle. - Yeah.

Well, I heard they found his shoe 30 feet away.<eos> I heard they still haven't found his face.<eos> Horrible.<eos> We're horrible. Everyone in this room is horrible.<eos> I heard they had just had sex right before he went out and...<eos> - Give it up, Mel.<eos> - Crap. I wonder if that was the first time they'd ever had sex.<eos> I wonder if that was the first time he'd ever had sex.<eos> - That's probably what killed him.<eos> - What are you talking about? Okay, you're a virgin for 75 years and then the first time you have sex, you do it with a Las Vegas showgirl?
That's how she hooked him.<eos> Finally offered to bring them in for her, and it was all over.<eos> Trash! Hooked him with trash.<eos> You're getting over it very well.<eos> I know.<eos> But if you ever decide that you want to sell this place, I know I could get you a really good price.<eos> Oh, and I have the most adorable beach condos that are just perfect for a single girl like yourself because any way you slice it, seven acres is a lot.<eos> Uh...<eos> I'm sorry, how many acres?<eos> Hubbell bought the place and was slowly fixing it up.
Well, they've seen me and Em so we'll check the room.<eos> You two keep an eye on 'em, give us a heads up if they move, yeah?<eos> All right.<eos> We haven't got a lot of time.<eos> - You go that way.<eos> - Yep.<eos> It's not here.<eos> I'm making a real pig's ear of this, ain't I?<eos> All those times Mickey's bailed us out and I can't even find a painting.<eos> Oh, we're gonna find it. It's just a matter of time. Yeah.
Tough.<eos> Er, excuse me, can we, er...<eos> can we get on with this, please?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What do you think I'm flaming doing here?<eos> I've come to swap this painting for my mate.<eos> - That is my painting.<eos> - No. My painting.<eos> - Look, I nicked it fair and square.<eos> - Yeah, and now I'm getting it back.
Must be, er... kinda hard for you turning up and finding me like this.<eos> No, I just... just wish I'd met you sooner.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> I'm glad you came back.<eos> There's something I need to talk to you about... before Grace gets back.<eos> Do you know... about the storm... and these weird powers?<eos> I did hear something about...<eos> I know we've only just met each other. There's no-one else I can talk to.<eos> Grace... has a power.<eos> And she's been using it to keep me alive.
This better be good.<eos> I know where it is.<eos> I know who's got your cock.<eos> Apparently, she just turned up one night with a cock.<eos> No surgery, nothing.<eos> What's her name?<eos> She calls herself James.<eos> She hangs around in the karaoke bar on the estate.<eos> There's half.<eos> You get the rest when I get it back.
Two, she's a woman, she hasn't got a penis. Oh, she's the stepmother-sucker.<eos> No!<eos> One, she isn't me stepmum.<eos> Two... Can we talk about something else?<eos> So she did suck you off?<eos> Only technically.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> You tripped and inserted your cock in her mouth?<eos> We're in the kitchen and suddenly she starts going down on me.<eos> Before I could stop her, she gets me out and rams it in her... and I was like, "Whoa!" And then I was like...
Big discount.<eos> And I'll throw in an additional executive physical.<eos> And I have a... a... an assortment of complimentary Hankmed sundries for you.<eos> This is a first aid kit.<eos> Uh, flavored antacids, grape and cherry.<eos> Tastes like childhood, really.<eos> And, uh, oh, my God, I have enough hand sanitizer... you could literally take a bath in it.<eos> Hand sanitizer.<eos> That's lovely.<eos> Why don't you use it to wash your hands of my retainer?
I don't know. Yeah, I guess.<eos> You were nervous then, and you were nervous about going to camp.<eos> Did you take anything?<eos> The girl, Alex, who convinced you, did she give you something to calm your nerves?<eos> Yeah, maybe Alex gave me some of her mom's antidepressants.<eos> How long ago did you take your cold medication?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Over an hour. Okay, we need to try to stop the effect of the cold medicine in his system.<eos> I've called 911. They're on their way.<eos> If we don't get it out of his body now...
I'll start CPR. Call 911.<eos> - She has an ICD. - Uh-huh.<eos> I saw.<eos> Sudden defibrillation.<eos> Wait.<eos> She said she was having ionization therapy.<eos> Are there magnets in that blanket?<eos> - They're woven into the fabric.<eos> - They deactivated her ICD.<eos> If the blanket deactivated it, it can restart it.
- It'll be fun.<eos> - No.<eos> What were you saying about you turned some blog into a book?<eos> - Oh, yeah, yeah, my blog.<eos> - Oh. - I sent you the link.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, right. - Of course. Okay.<eos> - So that's why I'm here. - I'm going to meet publishers. - Great.<eos> That's great. - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So before I do that, I want you boys to read it.
I've left your father.<eos> Oh, my goodness, perfect timing.<eos> The meat is still bloody, just the way you like 'em.<eos> After today, I think I'd rather have it medium.<eos> - All right. - Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's this website with your picture on it, dad?<eos> That's my blog that you read.<eos> Oh, yeah. Did you... you change the layout?<eos> - Look how many people read it.
Is he gonna open the door?<eos> Right, so it had to be somebody that he knew and trusted and someone he wouldn't think was trying to kill him.<eos> And someone who had Ilya's gun, which is why we're gonna be watching our victim's house the rest of the night.<eos> Thanks, Morris.<eos> Keep me posted.<eos> Is Blum at L.A.X already? Waiting for the courier.<eos> Once Morris makes the arrest,<eos> I think the ecstasy operation is pretty much history.<eos> As for the murder charges related to Yossi hersch disappearing in Pittsburgh... let's wrap up the murder of Mr. Strauss first, please.<eos> Everyone will be expecting it, but no one will actually eat the egg salad.
Come out with me tonight to Chinatown for dancing.<eos> Not tonight.<eos> I have to rise earlier than I care to.<eos> Inspector Robinson and I are working on a case.<eos> Is he unable to solve crimes alone?<eos> Jack is strictly business.<eos> Lin... I care for you.<eos> But you know I can never commit myself to any man.<eos> I know.<eos> I've turned the office upside down looking for that migrant article. I can't find it anywhere.
Coffee is ready downstairs, Miss Fisher.<eos> Thank you, Mr Butler.<eos> If a French luncheon is in order, I noticed that the butcher's shop has duck in the window.<eos> That's very considerate, but we will be dining out.<eos> Very good, miss.<eos> Mr Butler.<eos> The painting in the parlour.<eos> You know the one I mean.<eos> Could you please lift it down and wrap it?<eos> Madame Sarcelle will be taking it with her.
Later.<eos> She's naked, all right.<eos> The 911 call came in this morning.<eos> A canoer found the body after his morning paddle.<eos> Female, late 20s, trauma to the head.<eos> No clothes, no I.D., no nothing.<eos> I'm thinking we may have a sexual predator on our hands.<eos> You may want to rethink that, compadre.<eos> Rethink what?<eos> You've barely even seen the body, much less examined it.
- Tell them to go away!<eos> - They won't go, Beth.<eos> They're coming through this door, and if they see you with that gun...<eos> - Delia? - U.S. Marshals!<eos> - You have a choice.<eos> You do.<eos> - You're lying. - No, I'm not.<eos> - Delia?<eos> You just need help.<eos> I'll make sure you get it.
We got a significant business... (shouting) Would you listen to me for a minute?<eos> I need you to make up with him.<eos> We don't want that crazy bastard Billy as my son's best man.<eos> You guys sound like you're fighting.<eos> We're not fighting. Ifyou're fighting, Mom's got some salsa in the kitchen.<eos> We're fine, Max.<eos> No, it's not a fight.<eos> Hey, do you have a new pet or something?<eos> MAX: Yes, I have a bearded dragon.<eos> It's upstairs. Do you wanna see it?
I need to figure out why he's still under,<eos> - but, uh, he's-he's great.<eos> - Good.<eos> Look, Alex, I-I know you're disappointed about losing chief resident. Well, I am.<eos> I can't lie.<eos> But...<eos> I hope you don't feel like I'm punishing you.<eos> I don't.<eos> The truth is, I can't give you what you need right now.<eos> You made the hard call, and I accept it.
So, first things first. I'm gonna numb the area.<eos> - Ready? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Needle and ultrasound, please.<eos> Got it.<eos> Great.<eos> You might wanna look away.<eos> You're gonna hear a little pop as the needle removes the sample.<eos> There you go.<eos> All done. Just put a rush on the sample, okay?<eos> Why? Breast cancer's found late in men because nobody's looking for it.
Well, who's meowing now, bitches?<eos> There are six cats in there.<eos> Which one scratched you?<eos> Does it matter, Ryan?<eos> They've all scratched someone.<eos> So what are you planning to do?<eos> Kill them.<eos> But first, I will torture them by driving them insane.<eos> Pitiful fools.<eos> Oh, you want the string, but you'll never catch it.
No, really.<eos> Take a minute with him.<eos> What happened?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The court...<eos> They won't even hear the appeal, the bastards.<eos> What? I...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> There were no legal errors in your proceeding, but I was hoping to sell them on unreasonable result.<eos> They didn't buy it.
- but that gall bladder... it had several adhesions.<eos> - Oh. It had fatty tissues.<eos> It had... You did good work.<eos> Uh-huh. Then why are you here?<eos> To offer you the job of chief resident.<eos> Uh, last time I checked, Reid had that job.<eos> She needs some time.<eos> Well, does she know?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Uh, it's what I wanted, just not how I wanted to get it.
They want to conquer the world, and they're crazy enough to do it and it doesn't matter how many people get hurt or killed.<eos> One of the worst things about being immortal is having to watch this same stupid scenario happen over and over.<eos> It's usually the humans, though.<eos> Guess this proves we're just as fucking retarded as they are.<eos> Can't believe Eric and Bill weren't even gonna warn Sookie... -...<eos> Russell Edgington was coming after her. - Must all roads lead to fucking Sookie?<eos> They were just gonna let him drain her, all because according to their Vampire Bible she's an abomination.<eos> Maybe there's something to this religion after all.<eos> You know, it took both of us to take that buck down this morning.<eos> Sure would be a shame if you overcooked it.
So...<eos> No.<eos> How about you?<eos> Um, my girlfriend and I are gonna...<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> We think this thing on Janell's lung is something called a teratoma.<eos> It's creating antibodies that are attacking her brain.<eos> Well, I don't get it.<eos> Basically, her body sees the tumor as an invader and is attacking it, and her brain is getting hurt in the crossfire.
Yes, doctor.<eos> You should at least listen to her.<eos> Look, I swear, you gotta stop encouraging her.<eos> Well, this is what you taught me to do.<eos> You taught me to not give up until we've tried everything.<eos> Because you can handle it.<eos> When we lose a patient, I know if you're okay or you're not because I'm right there with you.<eos> With her, I cannot do that, because I don't think she can handle it. Not now.<eos> You are the one who is too emotionally involved.<eos> Okay, if this tumor had come to you from any other doctor, you would still be looking at it.
Your mother doesn't want...<eos> And I finally figured out why.<eos> She wants everyone around her to be ordinary so she can be extraordinary.<eos> She wants everyone around her small.<eos> Oh, you stop it.<eos> And that's what she's done to you.<eos> She has made you small.<eos> And I'm not gonna let her do it to me.<eos> I d... I don't know what's wrong with me.<eos> All I know is that the baby is coming and I want it.
What's this?<eos> A large welt of a bruise on her lower back.<eos> Witness report.<eos> A bloke walking his dog saw the victim. With a blonde girl, hanging about the boat yard.<eos> So she could have fallen over the railings.<eos> Or could've been pushed.<eos> They don't know which.<eos> She was wearing a jacket with Amanda Delany's name inside.<eos> There was a programme from the funeral in her pocket.<eos> Which is why the local cops brought it to us.
Give it!<eos> No, I won't.<eos> Look, I'll go to the police. I'll tell them about you and Lester.<eos> I'll tell them!<eos> Give it, give it!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> It was an accident.<eos> And I couldn't... do anything about it, because... she disappeared so fast, and I... I can't swim!<eos> Tell us about the diary.<eos> (SNIFFS) Amanda left it in the flat, after she had that meeting with the publisher bloke.
Give it, give it!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> It was an accident.<eos> And I couldn't... do anything about it, because... she disappeared so fast, and I... I can't swim!<eos> Tell us about the diary.<eos> (SNIFFS) Amanda left it in the flat, after she had that meeting with the publisher bloke.<eos> She even made me and Dan leave her, for privacy.<eos> And... Felicity was meant to come with us, but she passed out.<eos> And she overheard him talking about how much money it was worth.<eos> So... Felicity and I read it, but not all of it, because the next day Amanda sent her driver to get it.
It's too soon.<eos> Too soon for who?<eos> It's a tribute to your mother.<eos> What I had with your mother, I want to have again.<eos> There's no greater compliment.<eos> She'd understand...<eos> It's not a compliment.<eos> It's not a compliment and it's not a tribute, and to say it is is to talk absolute shite because all we've got of Mum is her memory.<eos> That's all we've got.<eos> And you should respect it and treasure it, and you don't respect it by pulling some bloody slapper when she's only been dead a few months.
Do you mean Elena?<eos> Elena Perez?<eos> - I don't know. - It's all right.<eos> Is that her?<eos> Yeah, yeah, sh-she was there, but... th-th-there was somebody else, another girl.<eos> Who?<eos> I-I can see her. She...<eos> She was beautiful.<eos> You, uh, you had this pendant in your pocket.<eos> You were carrying it around. It must be important.
Marshal. Hi.<eos> You remember me this time, huh?<eos> You two know each other?<eos> Yeah, we've met.<eos> Sit down, honey.<eos> Did Delroy do that to you?<eos> - Is it that bad?<eos> - I've seen worse.<eos> Hey.<eos> Now, if you dissolve some salt in hot water, dip some cotton balls in it and put it on your bruises, it'll keep them from getting darker. - Rough day, Ellen?
Spend a week in Mendoza, and you'll find a dozen or so malbec producers that'll give most Bordeaux a real run for their money.<eos> - Mm.<eos> - I'm sorry. This should come with a warning--<eos> "may cause pretentiousness."<eos> You should come with a warning-- "may be fascinating."<eos> - Oh! Excuse me. - Ohoh, gosh!<eos> - Oh, that's, like, the ninth time this screw has popped out.<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> I need the angled screwdriver. - I left it at the office. - Mm.<eos> I, um, I keep it there because of--of all my signs.
Cap?<eos> Hawkeye?<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> You OK, soldier?<eos> No, not until i have Purple Man's head on my wall<eos> Even if we have to go through Dtark to do it.<eos> Cap, what are we gonna do?<eos> The Purple Man, he's taken the whole world.<eos> We take it back.
Or what?<eos> Death.<eos> Maybe, maybe not.<eos> But it is a warning.<eos> You are being tested.<eos> We all are being tested all the time.<eos> Life is a test.<eos> You have murder in your heart.<eos> That's a fact.<eos> I've been carrying it there for many years.
You shut up!<eos> Adina!<eos> Why does everybody want to make my papa bad?<eos> Not bad. Good.<eos> I think he's a whistle-blower, completely different than a stool pigeon.<eos> What? It's exactly the same thing!<eos> Adina, apologize!<eos> No. She called my father a snitch.<eos> I'm sorry. She's just very upset.<eos> No, it's all right. Willa needs a good slap every once in a while and it's against the law for me to do it.
Yo, what's-- what's it feel like?<eos> You ain't never tried it?<eos> Never wanted to.<eos> It makes things go away.<eos> Want a taste?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why not?<eos> I mean, there's an obvious need to consolidate the western counties that--<eos> This office would seem like an unnecessary expense.<eos> Don't know why you need to keep it open, Governor.
Does it matter?<eos> I've been trying to reach you.<eos> I was out. My phone died.<eos> Listen, I'm not feeling well. Can we talk later?<eos> You were out... during what could have been the most important 24-hour period of my life.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> I was faced with a decision-- one I might have had to make without your counsel.<eos> Which is strange because...<eos> I've come to rely on you through the years, this past one in particular, during which we've become close again, solidified our bond.<eos> Is that what you call it?
The same thing I didn't know before, whether I'm gay or not.<eos> Well, I can help you with that.<eos> No, I need to figure it out on my own.<eos> How are you going to do that, is that even possible?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> But my mom said that I should try experimenting in some non-sexual ways.<eos> And what would that be?<eos> I don't know. Hmm.<eos> Here's what I would suggest.<eos> We just have sex right now and if you like it, we do it one more time just to make sure, and, hey, if it takes, it takes.
It's that dimwit, crawling back.<eos> Go get it, Igor.<eos> It's all a bit confusing.<eos> We dug and dug, didn't dig enough and now you're telling us to go?<eos> You're not being straight with me, Galya.<eos> Not being straight at all.<eos> I want my share of the gold!<eos> What gold?<eos> I know you've got gold... in there!<eos> I'll get it myself.
Oh, my God.<eos> Look, Max, he's a figure skater.<eos> Go ahead, take it all in.<eos> How could you not?<eos> It's okay, I'm a model. I'm used to it.<eos> Hey, I know you.<eos> You're the Big Bill.<eos> You're the guy from the gag greeting cards.<eos> Yep. I sold 2 million of that particular card.<eos> On the front it says, "You're on," when you open it up...
Oh!<eos> Why are you freaking out?<eos> You've already seen him naked.<eos> It's not him.<eos> Have you seen the size of this toilet?<eos> That is a big-ass toilet.<eos> Literally.<eos> Max, I'm finished.<eos> The floor is so clean you could eat off it, and I'm sure he will.<eos> Come on in, I want you to see it.

Everything's okay.
You were with her this morning.<eos> Cassidy and I, we, uh, kept it really casual.<eos> We both had busy days, so we met at the stable.<eos> And...<eos> And we baked pies and sang Christmas carols.<eos> We had sex; that's not a crime.<eos> I mean, you make it sound like it was consensual.<eos> It was.<eos> You're in our system for statutory rape, Mickey.<eos> Well, you call it statutory rape, I call it a miscommunication of age.
They collected data from expedition sites at over 40 locations around the globe and they came up with a number.<eos> They came up with 93 million, 726 thousand and 900 miles as the distance between the sun and the Earth.<eos> Now today we know, using modern radar equipment, that the distance between sun and Earth is just under 93 million miles, which means, incredibly, in the 1700s they were accurate to within 1%.<eos> 'It was a real triumph for science and one that marked the birth of modern astronomy as we know it.'<eos> I find it simply amazing that in 1769 they could work out the size of the solar system.<eos> And this number, the astronomical unit, couldn't be more important today.<eos> It's the foundation of modern astronomy and without it, my job simply wouldn't exist.<eos> And just to think, they did all this using only the sun and Venus. It still blows my mind.<eos> In the early hours of tomorrow morning, you, like Captain Cook, will be able to view the transit.<eos> All around the world, scientists will also be observing and studying it, but this time they'll be looking for answers to new mysteries.
That way, they'll know where to look when, so the bullets have a chance of meeting.<eos> This is where all the action happens, there is where the signals from the telescopes are brought in, 20 million channels a second being analysed.<eos> Tell me what happens here.<eos> There's a whole room full of electronics and fibre optics and other hi-tech stuff. And all the signals from all the antennas go in there. They're sliced and diced and sampled and, you know, some part of them is then sent to be analysed for signals.<eos> What would the signal have to be lik to get you out of bed at three in the morning?<eos> Nobody would call me unless the signal had the characteristics required to get me out of bed, but it would have to be a very clean-looking signal, a very narrow band and drifting at a rate that looks like it's not a transmitter here on Earth.<eos> ET, yeah, I'll get out of bed!<eos> It's utterly incredible to think that these images, which amount to really nothing more than noise and fluff on the screen, could ultimately be the first tantalising glimpse that we get of life elsewhere?<eos> Yes, it doesn't look very dramatic, but that's the nature of discovery science and that's what we're doing.<eos> A little plot like this with just a little wiggly, scraggly bit of brightening across it, that's the clue that would tell us that there's somebody out there.
No, actually, it's forbidden to point Hubble to the sun because it could damage the instruments, so we are going to use a trick which is pointing at the moon.<eos> In other words, we are going to use the moon as a giant mirror.<eos> It just seems like such a huge undertaking and there's only one chance in your lifetime to get it right.<eos> This is a unique opportunity to record the transit of Venus with Hubble.<eos> Does that make you a little bit nervous about getting it right?<eos> More than a little bit.<eos> From the first transits we witnessed to the one that's happening tonight, the transit of Venus has transformed our understanding of the vast universe we belong to.<eos> It's given us the size of our own solar system and now it's helping us to take giant leaps into distant space in our search for life.<eos> It's meant so much to so many people and tonight is no exception.<eos> I'm going to watch it with my kids.
This one is massive.<eos> Yes.<eos> Using this kind of technique makes the sun much, much bigger.<eos> Do you think you'll be viewing the transit?<eos> Yeah. It's going to be exciting.<eos> SHE LAUGHS Yeah.<eos> Absolutely beautiful.<eos> I look at the moon quite a lot through binoculars.<eos> You're a bit of a pro at this, aren't you?<eos> Wherever you're watching it, this is going to be a spectacular event.
Do as I say, or I will shoot.<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> - The next will be in your head.<eos> Get it?<eos> - Can I show you something?<eos> Lie down on the floor. Do as I say.<eos> Soon this place will be crawling with cops.<eos> The code.<eos> I thought I should give you the code, Karl.<eos> Before everyone else gets here and wants it.

Leo Eischer.<eos> The code David made can't be extracted from the system where it's installed.<eos> That means, you could only spread it by way of the original, the source code.<eos> So, even if you found a liberated hubot, there's no way of extracting the code.<eos> - Have you dealt with liberated units?<eos> It's a felony, you know that.<eos> Okay.<eos> How would you be able to help us?<eos> What's this collaboration of yours?<eos> Even if I placed the code right under your nose, you wouldn't recognize it.
Thanks for telling me.<eos> What?<eos> They found my phone and wallet in the cab.<eos> And you look like you've lost it again.<eos> I checked the cab, Hans.<eos> It wasn't there.<eos> Is it the worst thing, that you haven't been robbed?<eos> No, the worst is that not even you believes me.<eos> How many times have you come home, claiming this and that, missing or stolen.<eos> - Always ending with me finding it. - Okay.
I complained to Dr. Denning, but who's going to commit murder over a couple hundred dollars missing from my purse?<eos> Look, I don't know what you two are driving at, but I've never met Bree Michaels.<eos> Susan Barrett was murdered by her husband. Everybody knows that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> And since you have never met Bree Michaels and you're convinced that Susan was murdered by her husband, you won't mind if we take this knife in for a closer examination.<eos> The serrated edge appears to be similar to the wounds that killed Bree Michaels.<eos> We broke the knife down and recovered trace blood between the hilt and the cross guard. It could be fish blood.<eos> I'm testing it right now.<eos> A test with a rush put on it, Carlos.
I thought you didn't want to see us anymore.<eos> Actually, I couldn't bear the idea of not seeing you before you left town.<eos> But more important-- Here, you can sit down.<eos> I'm sorry-- ...is that I brought you my book.<eos> I need you to read it.<eos> - Jesus, it's hot.<eos> - Great. Yeah.<eos> - That's fine.<eos> - Are you boiling?<eos> Great, we'll read it on the plane.

We're taking you back home.<eos> Beck, that is an emergency beacon to summon the military.<eos> They're turning you in to the occupation.<eos> I'm part of the military.<eos> Coble told me. Beck, no!<eos> He is lying to you!<eos> Don't listen to him.<eos> You're an officer in Tessler's army.<eos> You just lost your disk.<eos> If you go back with Coble you'll get it back.
Guys, could we maybe watch a different movie or just stop saying that word six times per minute?<eos> - What word?<eos> - Blade. Oh, because of Britta's ex-boyfriend.<eos> Can you check my messages for me and tell me if he called?<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> What if my mother died? You guys are really talking over Blade.<eos> - Not cool!<eos> - Annie, subdue your guest.<eos> Annie, think for one second.<eos> You have my phone, and you're not even checking it.
My mom doesn't do anything for me either.<eos> Mom is a mom just by being there.<eos> Bye.<eos> Yikes!<eos> Oh it's you!<eos> You scared me!<eos> I thought you were Mr. HWANG.<eos> This is for you.<eos> You brought your snack for me again?<eos> Eat it when you're hungry.
I just need you to explain the system.<eos> Who would know about Cahill's being undercover?<eos> Only his handler.<eos> What about the people that have access to his paperwork, files?<eos> Files on undercovers are kept only as hard copies, so people like you can't hack into them.<eos> Words wound, Detective.<eos> The files are kept in safes in one room controlled by IAB.<eos> However, only the handlers have the combinations to their UC's safe.<eos> Anyone tries to break in, IAB will send them on a one-way trip to Rikers.<eos> We would need to destroy Cahill's file before anyone could retrieve it.
But that's missing the point.<eos> If I were to ask those two what the best supercar ever made is, I know what they'd answer.<eos> Ferrari F40.<eos> There's something of the Ferrari F40 about this.<eos> Something to do with the way it rides on the road, the way it feels.<eos> The simplicity of it.<eos> I buy the argument for a flamboyant supercar. I get it.<eos> But maybe there is another way of doing it.<eos> There's a sort of joy in things that simply work really well, like this gearbox.<eos> It's sort of like a two-stage trigger on a sniping rifle... you can preload it with half a ball... and then change.
Sorry. Where were we?<eos> Uh, Mrs. O'Sullivan was just telling me about some of your charitable work in Africa.<eos> Sierra Leone.<eos> Yes.<eos> Africa. It's 1 of our favourite places, isn't it, sweetheart?<eos> Where have you been, Frank?<eos> The client called twice, and now I can't get him on the line.<eos> I've had my hands full, Carla.<eos> I'm not the only one after the package.<eos> - Who else wants it?
Last week.<eos> You, me, happy hour, Harvey's corporate card.<eos> Are you crazy? You want to leave the office at 5:00?<eos> Oh, don't be ridiculous.<eos> Happy hour starts at 4:00.<eos> It's a bad idea. You're never going to get an injunction to stop the strike outright.<eos> You read that in a book, or is that what your five minutes practicing law have to say?<eos> Not a book but every labor decision from the last ten years.<eos> But I'm telling you, it's a safer bet arguing for the temporary restraining order.<eos> First of all, a T.R.O. delays a strike, an injunction stops it, and I want to stop it.
You're calling this art?<eos> Obviously not in the traditional sense - In what sense of the word would it be art?<eos> Come on!<eos> This is no better than breaking and entering.<eos> It's the same as breaking and entering, really?<eos> It's the same thing?<eos> It is gangbangers destroying private property.<eos> Let me explain something to you, okay?<eos> I worked very hard to own this wall.<eos> If want someone to paint it, I will ask them to do so.
It looks like we're not the only ones that he pissed off.<eos> Oh, click on that one.<eos> "This punk hit two of my pieces within 24 hours.<eos> I hat him."<eos> Pretty sure he means "hate."<eos> I have a feeling this is more of a visual type.<eos> This guy moves fast.<eos> It's almost like he knows when the piece is gonna come up.<eos> So let's throw out some bait.<eos> Yeah, we'll put up a new piece, we'll post it on the blog, and then we'll stake it out.
Give that Nikki girl a call.<eos> I'm not sure about her.<eos> She's pretty church-y.<eos> Hmm. Well, then there's a good chance that she won't sleep with my boyfriend, so I like her already.<eos> And judging by the way you're looking at that flyer, so do you.<eos> Hey.<eos> How's... how's the food?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tapas.<eos> Believe me, I don't get it either.
Whoever our imposter was, I believe he murdered Goebel, then took his place.<eos> After nearly 500 years, its meaning remains obscure, even to scholars.<eos> You asked me here to talk about art, Mr. Ballard?<eos> A subject which bores me to tears except for this particular picture.<eos> It was painted in 1533, a period of intense economic unrest in Europe, but not unlike today.<eos> Some think it was commissioned by a French ambassador, but I believe it was British merchants.<eos> Is this supposed to interest me?<eos> It should.<eos> These merchants felt constrained by their governments who wrote the laws and levied the taxes. So they formed a secret pact.<eos> They called it Hourglass.
You need a lion's share.<eos> I have to say, you have a fire in your belly.<eos> A fuel that's driving you, motivating you to change.<eos> Most men don't.<eos> Helen, right?<eos> No need to tell me.<eos> A man's dying words carry the weight of either love or loss.<eos> Usually both.<eos> What do you care?<eos> A chicken can do as many pushups as it wants, the fox is still gonna eat it.
Just, uh Thing... you know, what I see.<eos> It just comes out like that.<eos> I like your hair.<eos> What is it?<eos> I've run the mystery '63's blood, sir.<eos> We've got ourselves a match.<eos> Now, all you have to do is catch him, I suppose.<eos> That was excellent.<eos> Your bow makes the sweetest sound.<eos> Well, I string it myself.
He strings his bows with it.<eos> Blonde, black...<eos> Yeah, it's frayed.<eos> All used up.<eos> This one's red.<eos> Just the one.<eos> He's got another girl.<eos> (Porter) I just wanted to play for people.<eos> Isn't that the point?<eos> If a violin gets played and no one hears it, is that music or futility?
Sounds to me like a cop working undercover.<eos> - So, what killed this thing?<eos> - Good question.<eos> Agents down the hall say they heard the screams.<eos> By the time they opened the door, it was on the floor writhing in pain, and then it just died.<eos> On the case we worked before he was working with a partner.<eos> He was infected too but didn't know.<eos> - Almost transformed days later.<eos> - We should find him.<eos> Yeah, I've been trying to think of his name, but I can't remember it.
No, I do not.<eos> I trust you implicitly.<eos> - 3:00 A.M.<eos> - What are you talking about? Your car pulled in the driveway at 10:30, and you were lights out by 11:15.<eos> You were spying on me?<eos> No!<eos> I gave the old lady across the street 20 bucks to do it.<eos> She's got her own night-vision goggles.<eos> I can't live like this!<eos> If this ring is a tracking device, then I don't want it!
And I can't go on living with this.<eos> Mom...<eos> Shh!<eos> Vincent Moranto... I want you to come live with me. What?<eos> !<eos> We're engaged!<eos> There's absolutely no one else I'm interested in, plus your waterbed makes me nauseous.<eos> Hey, in '88, that was top of the line. Cost me 600 bucks.<eos> Yeah, well, it makes my ass sweat and it smells like grilled lamb.<eos> Why didn't you tell me you hated it?
Romantical involvement until I relocated to San Diego.<eos> Which is...<eos> That's in California, which is southwest of here by a number of miles.<eos> So, we terminated our involvement at that time.<eos> Are you here for a while?<eos> No, just tonight, for the Chief's retirement thing.<eos> Oh.<eos> We're going to that, too, actually. But we're going to go a little later. Because first, we're going to have dinner at a really nice, new French restaurant.<eos> Cool.<eos> I'm going to go to the gas station and get a frozen burrito and eat it right there at that table.
I said my thing first.<eos> Actually, that's why we were at the police station today. We're trying to get Chief Trumple's endorsement.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Hugh's a buddy of mine. I could probably get him to endorse you.<eos> Oh, man, that would be amazing.<eos> LESLIE: Yeah.<eos> Thank you. Hey.<eos> Excuse me. I need to use the bathroom.<eos> Oh, you mean the whiz palace.<eos> Yes, Leslie calls it that sometimes.
Packer's giving one.<eos> - Jim will probably give ours, I guess.<eos> - Damn it!<eos> Let's see, what else have you missed?<eos> Ryan switched his name tag to his pants, so now if you wear yours on your shirt, you're a total dick, but if you switch, you're a copycat.<eos> But I think I figured out a solution.<eos> What else?<eos> My shoes are gonna...<eos> Features a tech support area.<eos> Bring in your product, a bunch of nerdy virgins fix it on the spot.
We think it's a homicide.<eos> Why?<eos> No evidence of ignition at the scene.<eos> So whoever set them on fire had to have taken it with them.<eos> The same substance was used. To burn through the lock on the gate. And the lock on the loading dock door.<eos> - And we found other instances of similar break-ins, all at abandoned or shut down properties.<eos> Someone stealing copper is nothing new.<eos> You check with the scrap yards?<eos> Yeah, according to them, they're not seeing any copper.<eos> So whoever's stealing it isn't selling it.
Well, so can they breathe fire?<eos> Well, in an obtuse way, I guess they can, yeah.<eos> I mean, from my understanding, and I'm telling you, I am not an expert on this, it's a kind of ketonic...<eos> What's the word I'm looking for... vomit.<eos> You ever hear of the low-carb, high-fat diet?<eos> Puts your body in a state of ketosis, where it burns its own fat.<eos> In their case, they can vaporize their own fat.<eos> Highly explosive and kind of disgusting.<eos> Unless, of course, you're dancing half-naked.<eos> On a stage. Well, how do they ignite it?
Now, hold on.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Hey, I'm just glad I could be here.<eos> To, you know, help rescue a woman I've never met before. Or been introduced to.<eos> But, you know, I... look, I don't take it personally.<eos> Are you really gonna bring that up right now?<eos> No, no, I know, I know, I'm just a little nervous.<eos> You know, these are daemonfeuers after all.<eos> And I know you have a plan, it's just, you know, you haven't shared it with me...
Tell everyone.<eos> Hey, everyone!<eos> Everyone I like.<eos> Never mind!<eos> But it is closing time.<eos> You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here.<eos> Bam! Oh.<eos> I just need one more glass of cab.<eos> That's actually illegal for me to sell after I close.<eos> That's why I'm not paying for it.
I had a job to do.<eos> This was your win, Peter.<eos> Yeah, this case has been nagging at me for 10 years.<eos> I got something better than a win.<eos> What's that?<eos> Closure.<eos> Well, you should have gotten your job back, too.<eos> Can't have it both ways.<eos> Yeah, at least you still got your yard for now.<eos> Yeah, we call it a picnic area.
I would rather be watching the Betamax.<eos> Also, I do not like this plan.<eos> Look, it's simple.<eos> The Hellerman gallery's hosting a new exhibit on modern Greek identity.<eos> To which you, as a prominent contemporary artist, will add...<eos> Ostensibly. So, what don't you like about the plan?<eos> Alex.<eos> Is she or is she not going to kill me?<eos> Alex parked the box truck out back.<eos> After they load it up, we follow it to the meet with Spiteri.
I think we could have worked together, but I warned you about this... no federal involvement.<eos> No, Sam, I didn't say anything to him, okay?<eos> You got...<eos> - I'm sorry, Neal.<eos> - Sam!<eos> What did he say to you?<eos> Calm down.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, three 2-minute rounds.<eos> No low blows, no punches after the bell, and the fight stops when the ref calls it.
He may as well be informed.<eos> Yeah, and if he puts his investigation on the books, it could put him at risk.<eos> You could ask him to be quiet. He's done it before.<eos> Yeah, well, not happily.<eos> But he's done it.<eos> On November 6th, you visited the defendant's penthouse, posing as an investor for his condo development.<eos> What evidence did you uncover? Delancy showed me a vial of benzene.<eos> He said it was known to cause cancer, specifically leukemia.<eos> Did he say what he planned to do with this particular vial?<eos> He said he planned to use it to lace the soil samples taken by Caplin Environmental.
With who?<eos> The mayor or the window washer?<eos> Who do you think?<eos> I think your real skill is the art of the bluff, making claims you know full well you can't back up.<eos> Yes, Landon Shepard for the mayor.<eos> Landon Shepard.<eos> Indeed, it has been some time.<eos> Well, we can confirm she's got a cell.<eos> That's Peter's play.<eos> If it were registered under her real name, we'd know about it.
Shall I say hi?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Anything?<eos> Well, good news is, - we've got Shepard's phone records dating back nine years.<eos> - Bad news?<eos> We've got Shepard's phone records dating back nine years.<eos> No names, all outgoing numbers.<eos> I mean, there must be thousands here.<eos> And for the record, she was wrong about my tattoo.<eos> I got it four years ago, not five.
Where did you get these?<eos> Buddy at Caplin Environmental.<eos> I want them in play.<eos> These photos will not see the light of day.<eos> Why not?<eos> That's none of your concern.<eos> Hey. You work for me.<eos> You tell Burke to stop digging around, or these will go public.<eos> Nobody tells me how to do my job.<eos> You do it, or I will.
I could slip out with one of these. What is it?<eos> State-of-the-art government tracker. It embeds in the skin like a tick.<eos> The subject is completely unaware it's there.<eos> So we bait whoever's after Sam, then plant that in them.<eos> How do we bait out our target?<eos> Surveillance-authorization form.<eos> We plant information to lure out whoever came after you, only this time, we control the circumstances.<eos> We need a secure location.<eos> We can use Friday, my third-favorite safe house.<eos> All right, it takes eight hours for this form to be processed. If we file it tomorrow morning, our surprise guest could show up before nightfall.
Micro-drones.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Vermin.<eos> Yes.<eos> May I borrow Percy?<eos> My pet rat -- he eats all the fancy cheeses that I...can't.<eos> In many ways, I live through him.<eos> Many ways?<eos> Don't get him started.<eos> Once Peter's scanned the last form, but before he signs it...
Ya, ugh, he ran right oat past us!<eos> Good.<eos> Then screw this.<eos> Please tell me that's a smoke grenade.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's not, though.<eos> Hoh-lee -- -- shitsnacks!<eos> What was that?<eos> Probably my stomach growling. I am literally starving to death.<eos> I don't care, Frank! We are gonna beat that record, so put this stupid train in... train-gear, and jam it!
But it's possible.<eos> Wasn't the theory that Jordan Chase killed the accomplices, then fled the country?<eos> Yes. But even if Chase killed the other four suspects, the Butcher still could have killed Chase.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Jordan Chase was very high-profile.<eos> It would be too risky.<eos> Still... it's worth looking into.<eos> Find what you're looking for?<eos> It says here Price bribed the funeral director to get access to Beverly Grey's body before she was cremated.<eos> He stole a blood sample and ran it for aconite.
Just rumour, Byrne, just rumour.<eos> Take them just in case.<eos> You know these Fritz, they try to repair it as soon as we cut it.<eos> Keep it moving.<eos> Sir...<eos> Sir, the men are ready, but some of them are concerned that the wire hasn't been cut.<eos> I've reassured them it has been from here to...<eos> I've been up and down the line all day and there's no shell damage.<eos> Christ.<eos> They've gone off behind the bloody wire, barely grazed it.
On the other hand, I have sources that have told me that you've been writing more prescriptions than Michael Jackson's doctor, which is odd, since all of your patients are dead.<eos> Quite frankly, my patience with your family is running out.<eos> I'm sorry you had to come all this way, but I'm afraid a deal is a deal.<eos> Well, I think we both know that this deal was built on a pack of lies.<eos> I don't do well with accusations, Mr. Ewing.<eos> And I won't be convinced to change my plans.<eos> The oil we were promised is part of a much bigger deal.<eos> You see, when Chavez nationalized the oil fields of my country, my partners and I lost billions of dollars.<eos> Now, where I come from, oil is power, just like here in Texas.<eos> Now, Chavez may have taken that power away but we're going to reclaim it.
Kingsbridge needs an inn dedicated exclusively to nursing the sick.<eos> A hospice.<eos> I've never heard of such a thing.<eos> With the bridge collapse, it made me realize how much we need one here.<eos> God willing we never have a catastrophe like that again.<eos> No, but pilgrims will always come here to be cured.<eos> Imagine if they could find care as well as miracles.<eos> And you'd build it here?<eos> - The convent owns this land, doesn't it?<eos> - Who would run it?
Godwyn's a fool.<eos> Elfric can't follow my plans!<eos> He doesn't even begin to understand them.<eos> This bridge will be a disaster.<eos> A great opportunity...<eos> Perhaps, perhaps not.<eos> You thought that this would be the culmination of your quest.<eos> But there's a world beyond this town bridge.<eos> You have a talent, Merthin.<eos> Go and find a place that will nurture it.
- Why?<eos> Nope.<eos> Chance of survival... still a whopping 13%.<eos> That's why.<eos> It freaks parents out.<eos> Morning.<eos> Dr. Robbins, 14.3 today.<eos> Well, at least that's headed in the right direction.<eos> On the other hand, uh, we got the X-rays back, and he's developed nec.<eos> His bowels are rotting, and unless we get in there and fix it...
Chin, hey, what's up?<eos> So we checked into the background of all the participants in the reenactment and we got a hit with HPD.<eos> Seth Burgess.<eos> He was arrested four years ago for trafficking stolen antiquities.<eos> Okay, so he's a smart perp.<eos> I mean, by doing these battle reenactments, he puts himself in the world of big-time collectors like Brandon Koruba.<eos> I checked with Mamo.<eos> He said that he saw Seth before the reenactment, but he slipped out early.<eos> Okay. We get an address?<eos> I'm sending it over.
You won't detect much in a crowd this fast in a blue wool suit and tie.<eos> I kept this aside for you.<eos> A passable Mark Antony, if we pilfer that sword on display in the billiard room.<eos> So I'm to be the triple pillar of the world transformed into a strumpet's fool?<eos> You've been at least a single pillar for far too long.<eos> No-one will know who you are.<eos> Except you.<eos> Come on, Jack.<eos> Just one gaudy night.<eos> If you really want a Roman soldier... then I'll take it from here.
Do you follow?<eos> Most likely the weapon was some sort of thin knife, a stiletto, perhaps.<eos> Or a hat pin?<eos> It's possible. Constable?<eos> Uh, I'm afraid there were so many women, sir, I-I didn't think to check.<eos> You seem so certain that Charles is guilty but pray, tell me, what was his motive?<eos> Witnesses saw them arguing.<eos> Perhaps his motive was money?<eos> Then why did he leave the cash behind?<eos> Perhaps because you fished it out of the deceased's pockets before he had the opportunity, Miss Fisher.
I let my hatred for Amanda get the better of me.<eos> You were right, Wildﬂower.<eos> I've got a lot to learn from you.<eos> It's me.<eos> I have to say, I'm surprised you called.<eos> That makes two of us.<eos> I need your help.<eos> What about Nikita?<eos> Let me be clear about this, Percy.<eos> We're gonna reboot the program and put it on the right course.
Sorry. Sorry.<eos> Let me.<eos> Do you like fish?<eos> Yeah. Fish and seafood.<eos> How about carp?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, I take it off the hook and when I look up, they are all watching me, all the fishermen with their big rods. And then, they're shouting.<eos> Like I'm the crazy one for catching a fish and taking it home to eat.<eos> What is wrong with these people?<eos> Catching a fish. Putting it back.
He's had a little accident.<eos> Accident?<eos> Wha...<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> MOBILE RINGS I was just trying to get through to my son's personal officer but they're not...<eos> I'll transfer you through to the communications room.<eos> No, I was just saying, no-one answered.<eos> I need to speak to someone now.<eos> Leave a message, and they'll pass it on to the residential staff.
I'm gonna get a medal.<eos> You back me up?<eos> Yeah.<eos> McNally?<eos> Yeah. Whatever you need.<eos> This isn't happening.<eos> Oh, I screwed up.<eos> I just so screwed up.<eos> I'm never home.<eos> I made this mess, now I'm gonna clean it up.
The... the juice, the joy, these stupid fucking rocks.<eos> I've had it.<eos> Blood sugar issues.<eos> Cathy.<eos> Good for you.<eos> You got it.<eos> You got it.<eos> She got it, people.<eos> All right? That bag is your old baggage.<eos> Why were you carrying it?
She makes me Rollerblade.<eos> And she knows that I get blisters.<eos> And besides, could we pick an activity that's a little less 1999?<eos> A little less 1999?<eos> Jesus, says the guy who still drives a Miata.<eos> It's like you went through your mid-life crisis at the age of 24.<eos> Can you believe he's a therapist?<eos> Well, I mean, I've only seen the framed license on his wall.<eos> At least I have a real profession.<eos> Pilates instructor? Why don't you call it what it really is?
Janelle, why don't you take Mr. Archer and show him the defensive perimeter?<eos> I'd be delighted.<eos> Whoa, no, wait a second...<eos> Fifth thoughts!<eos> Archer!<eos> Don't worry, she won't bite.<eos> But speaking of, it's about suppertime.<eos> You still partial to fried chicken?<eos> I'll cook it!<eos> If someone shaves it or whatever.
No, no.<eos> It's just... I got word that journal isn't going to publish my paper.<eos> Is that all?<eos> It got pulled in favor of a puff piece about Selena Gomez on a fossil hunt.<eos> I'm not familiar with Dr. Gomez's work, but I look forward to reading about it.<eos> I worked on that paper for six months.<eos> It was excellent.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> They sent it to me for review.<eos> You aren't supposed to know who's on the review board, but since they're not publishing it...
But Whitman killed two of their guys.<eos> Then he steals files from them.<eos> They don't want us to catch him, they want to kill him.<eos> Grabbing Lloyd slows us down.<eos> They probably got electrodes hooked up to his brain right now.<eos> Yeah, unlikely.<eos> Well, then, to his nuts.<eos> If they can find them.<eos> As soon as Lloyd's phone is on,<eos> I want you to put a trace on it.
Difficult to say.<eos> She was hit over the head, but she also has light bruising around the throat and petechial hemorrhaging, which would suggest that the victim was also strangled.<eos> So, why do both?<eos> Well, it's quite possible that the blow did not completely incapacitate her.<eos> Uh, based on her broken fingernails, which also seem that she fought back.<eos> With any luck, I might be able to retrieve some trace evidence of blood or foreign DNA from underneath them.<eos> Huh, looks like she was renting the dress for the night.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> That's when there's a fancy party and it's a dress you want and it's out of your league. You buy it and you return it the next day.
Rule one - do not be afraid of competition.<eos> Nobody wants to win a one-horse race.<eos> - I thought rule one was... - Shut it!<eos> Come on.<eos> So what have we got?<eos> Well, you were right about how he does business.<eos> He pays off agents, council officials, heritage commissioners to make sure the deal goes his way, and always for the right price.<eos> In fact his motto is, "Everybody has their price."<eos> Well, why hasn't he been prosecuted?<eos> Well, he never does the dirty deed himself. He always leaves it to one of his apprentices.
- No, you've talked about it, and I've ignored it, because it is ridiculous.<eos> Need I remind you that even if I win the election, I can still work at the Parks department.<eos> City council is a part-time job.<eos> and 50 hours a week on the campaign.<eos> Well, I have time to spare.<eos> I'm also volunteering at "Wheels For Meals On Wheels."<eos> We repair vans for "Meals On Wheels."<eos> You're a month behind on everything.<eos> You forgot to file the weekly Parks Maintenance report.<eos> You do it every week, and you forgot.
Bye, Champion.<eos> Morning, Leslie.<eos> Jerry, take that shirt off.<eos> You look ridiculous.<eos> Gayle gave me this shirt yesterday as a birthday present.<eos> Oh, my God, Jerry. I can't believe I forgot your birthday.<eos> Leslie, it is okay.<eos> I mean, let's face it, it's a tough one to remember.<eos> My birthday is February 29th, so I only get one real birthday, you know, once every four years.<eos> But it's great because my wife Gayle makes such a big deal out of it.
Doesn't mean that we agreed, though.<eos> Lounge, casino floor, vault, loading dock.<eos> First order of business-- the lock to the vault.<eos> Okay, it's a high-security lock, using a combination of side wards and pins.<eos> I can get into it, but it's gonna take more time than we got.<eos> Security comes by every five minutes.<eos> Then we're gonna need a key.<eos> Holmes, the security chief, carries it on him at all times.<eos> I'lltakecareofthat .<eos> The vault-- you cased it yesterday, right?
Take your mind off your troubles.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> You find out what happened?<eos> Must have talked to five different officers.<eos> Nobody could tell me how it could be on the Noah list to be... what you call it?<eos> Remediated.<eos> And on the "To be demolished" list at the same time.<eos> - Well, you still own the lot.<eos> - For what that's worth.<eos> Who's gonna buy it anyway?
I blew my interview, okay?<eos> What did Cavanaugh say?<eos> He said it's down to me and one other candidate.<eos> All right!<eos> So, come on. You're still in the hunt.<eos> Hey, get your own.<eos> Uh!<eos> What? We're making sure you don't get fat.<eos> There's Cavanaugh. Let's ask him.<eos> If you do, I will take this plate and stuff it down your throat.
I'm not gonna let him face that alone. He won't.<eos> But with all due respect, Your Highness,<eos> Phillip's best chance is me.<eos> You love him.<eos> What?<eos> Phillip.<eos> You love him, too.<eos> I owe him much.<eos> We fought many battles together, side by side. Nothing more.<eos> Deny it all you want. I know love when I see it.
Herderite doesn't occur naturally in Wyoming.<eos> Is that true? Yeah.<eos> Most herderite comes from Brazil or Africa.<eos> I collect minerals.<eos> You're full of surprises.<eos> Why do you think it's here?<eos> It is a bread crumb.<eos> I inherited the place about five years ago from my dad, but I'm a terrible rancher.<eos> The land went to hay a few years later, so I decided to lease some of it to Newett.<eos> And they promised that they'd clean it up after they were done drilling.
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> I want you to run the spa.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Well, how about a "yes"?<eos> Remember, I am not giving it to you.<eos> This is temporary, and I am coming back.<eos> Well, you'd better.<eos> In that file cabinet filed under "Christmas gifts," there's a little book with some very big names in it.<eos> The client list?<eos> I want you to take it when you leave tonight and put it someplace else only you know about, someplace safe.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> You okay?<eos> Getting there.<eos> I got to admit, I never knew you could fight like that.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> Ooh, I'm glad he didn't break one of my nails.<eos> That could've gotten ugly.<eos> Hey, do you have the book?<eos> Never got it. Thought you had it.
Thank you.<eos> Oh, and tell her breakfast in 10 minutes.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You sleep well last night?<eos> Okay.<eos> Without my daughter tossing around next to you?<eos> Mama, you awake?<eos> Oh, I hate to wake you up, but daddy said breakfast in 10 minutes, which probably means 15.<eos> Mama?<eos> I-I'm gonna put your coffee down here, and you can have it when you're ready, okay?
I'm not a dog person.<eos> He is much better off.<eos> God, he did the funniest thing last night.<eos> He was having this dream.<eos> He was really running or something.<eos> I don't know what dogs dream about.<eos> Anyway, he was...<eos> He was doing this thing, you know, with his paws, he was going...<eos> It was really cute.<eos> I mean, not as cute as I just did it, but...
Righteo, Mister Rivers.<eos> Broke down, have yous, lads?<eos> One of yous the owner of this car?<eos> Move back, please, if you wouldn't mind.<eos> Right back, please.<eos> I just got married in November.<eos> Give us a chance, will you?<eos> I want a visiting order.<eos> I'll get your form tomorrow.<eos> Just fill it out and get it delivered, first thing.
You held the sell tickets on Virtanen to the last minute so I wouldn't see.<eos> $100 million shorted, Adam?<eos> You said you wanted playmakers around here.<eos> You short sold Virtanen?<eos> Are you out of your mind? It's guilty, their stock craters, and I hold the price that I sold for.<eos> See, that's the smart money, Victor.<eos> Let it ride.<eos> All right, kid, but consider what you're betting.<eos> A verdict has just been read.<eos> They're relaying it now.
300 million, to be exact.<eos> Where are we?<eos> Tritak was down to $4 a share by closing bell today.<eos> When the market opens tomorrow, it'll be $2.<eos> I've got buy orders in place to pick up the shares that we need.<eos> And the loose ends?<eos> Baylor won't be asking any more questions, but Adam is still out there.<eos> He could be a problem.<eos> I've it under control.<eos> You'd be better off balling up that paper and stuffing it under your clothes.
Adam Hoyle took his own life eight years ago right after you walked free from court.<eos> Well, he brought it on himself.<eos> I never touched him.<eos> He lied.<eos> He lied and he lied.<eos> Yeah, but he was obviously sick in the head.<eos> Hey, how was your exam?<eos> I'm going to have to re-sit it next year.<eos> My brother had an accident.<eos> I missed it.
- Go on.<eos> - Mrs. Bishop.<eos> She works at the school up here. Where our three go.<eos> How well did you know her?<eos> I didn't.<eos> She's just one of the teaching assistants.<eos> I gave her my number three weeks ago.<eos> Three weeks ago?<eos> She were looking for lifts to a six-a-side for some of the little 'uns.<eos> She did write it on her hand.
So hopefully overnight we'll have a list of who was calling or texting her.<eos> The CSIs found other personal items at the property. Handbag, purse, the house keys, the car keys, the kind of things you'd normally take with you if you were going out but not the phone.<eos> So what's that telling us?<eos> That if she left the house, if she died away from the house, the only thing she took with her was her phone.<eos> But why would you not take your handbag and your house keys?<eos> Why would you leave the house anyway dressed like that?<eos> She was expecting someone.<eos> She wasn't going anywhere.<eos> She was in the house, expecting someone, someone she was going to titillate.<eos> And the phone's gone because whoever's killed her, took it because it's got something incriminating on it.
Last week.<eos> And what did you say to him?<eos> Just that I was thinking of just turning up there with me bags.<eos> She could hardly say no, could she?<eos> Amount she hasn't done for me over the years.<eos> I shouldn't say that, should I?<eos> She were... poorly.<eos> You asked us to think about why the body's been moved now if she was killed three weeks ago.<eos> Gavin told his dad last week that he was thinking about just turning up to a house that he hasn't been to for nearly three years.<eos> So what if Rob's had to move the body because he's frightened that Gavin's liable to swan in at any time and find it.
The kids who get out, like I did, the kids who are going to get out, like Daysha, those kids go to school, keep clean.<eos> And there's the kids who get lost and go the other way, like Leon did.<eos> We're trying to build up a picture of Leon's private life.<eos> We had a chat with Chantelle Deen - that's the other girl in the car with you, actually.<eos> Has Leon got any other children?<eos> He's got an older kid, but the mum moved south.<eos> And is there anyone else at all that you know of?<eos> A constant stream of girls, as far as I can see.<eos> Thanks again, Kriss.<eos> No probs. Listen. When you take your police tape away, don't just tear it, leaving bits behind.
Oh, come on, you do not.<eos> I'm just a pain in the ass.<eos> Well, I respect pains in the ass the most.<eos> Speaking of Eli, hello, Eli.<eos> Yes, sure, make me the butt of your jokes.<eos> So, Donna,<eos> I want the keynote.<eos> What do I have to do to get it?<eos> Impress me.<eos> Why do you want it?
David, what do you need?<eos> - Howard, do you mind?<eos> - Oh, sure.<eos> - Push me here, push me there. - Right.<eos> Take two steps that way.<eos> Sorry to interrupt your schmoozing. But do you know that Diane is digging this firm's grave because of her loyalty to you?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> Will, I always liked you.<eos> I thought you were smart.<eos> But this firm is not owned by you or Diane. And she is treating it like it is.
We haven't gotten a new judge yet on the Ponzi scheme, but that gives us time to recalibrate our attack.<eos> Okay.<eos> And that's what you were doing... recalibrating?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This case could take a couple of months.<eos> You up to it?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's a good case.<eos> Ah.<eos> You'll see it through?
Lester just called.<eos> I think you know what he said.<eos> You questioned my integrity. I wanted a second opinion.<eos> I thought that you wanted to be a journalist, not a noisemaker.<eos> He's a pig, Hal. And she's his willing accomplice.<eos> All the men in this town are afraid to write the truth about her because they don't want to be labeled anti-feminist.<eos> Well they won't be afraid to write about her anymore.<eos> Let the Elaine Hammond pile-on begin.<eos> Your piece runs tomorrow, first page of the Op-ed.<eos> Lester's running it?
Ten meters and closing.<eos> Five meters.<eos> Three.<eos> Two.<eos> One.<eos> Cable one attached, Topside.<eos> Cable two attached.<eos> Command, this is Topside.<eos> We're getting a pulsed message from the sub, but it makes no sense.<eos> Send it through, Topside.
Hurry up and pick your partner, and prepare with a joyous heart!<eos> This semester's ratings... will be just like a concert!<eos> Hi Mom.<eos> Hey! You have a cell phone!<eos> If you think it's unfair... carry a cell phone yourself.<eos> I can't talk right now. I'll talk to you later.<eos> I should be taking a video of that jerk and uploading it on the internet.<eos> I bet all the people in the karaoke room will be wailing along to it.<eos> Who are you going to do the semester ratings with?<eos> Of course... I should do it with my Hae Sung.
Chad Colombo, 40, a welder, unlikely to bear a child.<eos> And Claudia Cruz, 20, receptionist in the head office.<eos> Checking.<eos> Employment with Petrosian ended eight months ago, just when her pregnancy would have started to show. Get me an address.<eos> I'll go and talk to her.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> She's dead.<eos> Name showed up on a crime scene report.<eos> Died in her apartment from a fire four days ago.<eos> ME ruled it as an accident.
Randall McCarthy... And Owen banks.<eos> Nice art work.<eos> Well, they're obviously not exact likenesses, but they'll do.<eos> Now Owen banks was fired from Gallow's brewery just two days before Tom was killed.<eos> And Randall McCarthy-- Now Randall is the deceased's brother, but guess what.<eos> If Sabrina is convicted for the murder of Tom McCarthy, Randall inherits everything.<eos> Motive?<eos> Washroom break.<eos> And Mr. hot-shot here had a phone.<eos> Yeah, I found it in the bathroom. I was gonna return it.
It's the scuff mark.<eos> Wait a minute. There was a dresser right there.<eos> Randall must have sold it.<eos> Des, go move that chair.<eos> Whoa.<eos> The vent, and there's no grate!<eos> Brilliant! Dessie, I think you're gonna have to stick your hand in that hole.<eos> Has the jury reached a verdict?<eos> We have finally reached a unanimous verdict, my lord.<eos> Pass it onto the bailiff who will read it aloud.
- With the money you were gonna use for my fabulous birthday dinner.<eos> And there's my check.<eos> - It's gone.<eos> - Talia.<eos> - We spent it at sparkles.<eos> - What did we buy?<eos> My outfit, your outfit, Truly's outfit.<eos> - Truly owns the store!<eos> - It was a gift.<eos> It's not a gift unless you buy it for the person.
So where's the money now?<eos> The only two people who knew about it were me and Bridges.<eos> Helen wasn't back until the week after, and by that time he'd covered his tracks.<eos> We'll see what the police have to say.<eos> What if the two of us found the money?<eos> He didn't put it in his account, I know that.<eos> And he's definitely not spending it now, is he?<eos> So what do you say?<eos> That money belongs to the syndicate.<eos> If a tree wins the lottery in a forest and nobody hears it, did it really win the lottery?
The numbers were chosen randomly.<eos> How can they ever miss it?<eos> Nice one, Sherlock.<eos> Please, whatever she said, I'm sorry.<eos> Please, please don't harm her.<eos> Shhhhhhhhh. Sorry about that.<eos> Please continue, Gertrude.<eos> "Chapter funf.<eos> Eine dark night in hell."<eos> Oh, just so you know, they get so many details wrong in this chapter, but I'll read it for you anyway.
I respect that.<eos> I sort of made this promise to myself a long time ago that I would wait until...<eos> Till we got married.<eos> Uh, I mean you.<eos> Till you got married?<eos> - Uh. - Not exactly.<eos> I made a promise that I would wait until I won the gold.<eos> Well, I think that's really cool.<eos> That means you take sex seriously.<eos> And I mean, no one takes it seriously anymore.
Including him.<eos> I'd like to complete this project by... tomorrow.<eos> Oh.<eos> Set up shop in our office. In fact, take Leslie's desk.<eos> Okay, I will.<eos> Thanks. Great.<eos> Do you want the door open or shut?<eos> Ah, open's fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> We would like our regular table, but we want you to set it up a little fancier than normal because we're trying to impress someone.
And the... whatever these emblem things were.<eos> They're on the steering wheel, too.<eos> And the glove compartment.<eos> Why these and not the radio?<eos> I think... that they were gold. I got filings. I bet they wanted to make sure that they were solid and not plated.<eos> Yeah, but wouldn't filing them make them less valuable and harder to sell?<eos> Russell said the ring was one of a kind.<eos> That's hard to sell, too.<eos> So maybe they're not stealing the gold to resell it.<eos> Maybe they're melting it down.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> - Did you get the job? - No.<eos> Well, your next interview will end much better once we remove the cyst.<eos> We're gonna perform what we call a marsupialization of the cyst.<eos> We open up the wall of the cyst so that it can drain freely and then the fluid won't collect.<eos> So your dizzy spells will stop.<eos> But you said you found a tumor. Mm-hmm.<eos> We did.<eos> It's a small one. It's called a meningioma.<eos> It's benign, so we're gonna leave it alone.
If we don't escalate care... have they taught you what A.N.D. means yet?<eos> Allowing natural death.<eos> We're-we're not... we're not there yet.<eos> Things are deteriorating significantly.<eos> You-you think that's what I should do?<eos> I think that you need to consider what kind of life you want for your son.<eos> Is it okay for him to be in pain every day?<eos> Is it okay if he needs a feeding tube for the rest of his life?<eos> Is it okay if he can't run, climb, or crawl?<eos> If you want the surgery, we'll do it.
I don't think I should. 'Cause she just really looks like she's hurting right now.<eos> She's really hurting me! That's who she's hurting!<eos> Do you still believe in love, Robert?<eos> Oh, my God! Oh, it's okay! It's okay, Robert!<eos> It's Burt. It's your ex-girlfriend's temporary maid's husband.<eos> I think I have an idea how we can get Natalie back.<eos> Do you still believe in love?<eos> You brought us to your high school sex hideout?<eos> You know, it sounds cheap when you say it like that.<eos> Me and Virginia called it the "Stabbin' Cabin."
Five...<eos> Please tell me we are not responsible for getting rid of that abandoned car.<eos> At your park, that would be an abandoned car.<eos> At our park, it's a jungle gym.<eos> This is your park?<eos> No jungle gym, no sandbox?<eos> You're thinking of the white people's park.<eos> Everything's great at the white people's park.<eos> The ice cream guy sells ice cream at the white people's park.<eos> You know, they don't call it "The White People's Park" anymore.
- Okay, here's the deal.<eos> It's crazy boring, it lasts forever, you're gonna wish you were dead.<eos> Do you wanna borrow my yoga pants?<eos> Hey.<eos> So did Pillner finalize the budget?<eos> Are we okay? - We are the opposite of okay.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> To keep the money in Parks, they're gonna shut down the Westside animal shelter.<eos> The money had to come from somewhere, and the shelter is on its last legs.<eos> So... they're closing it at the end of the week.
His melody work was just so good.<eos> You listen to the end of Moonage Daydream and the solo on the end of that, it's simple but genius.<eos> For me, he was the best guitarist around in those days.<eos> He was the guitarist to have.<eos> He contributed so much. He looked great too.<eos> They made a great couple.<eos> If you'd seen those two onstage, it was exciting.<eos> David going down on Mick's guitar.<eos> Revelation!<eos> When my mother so that paper, she threw it on the table and said, "Is this who you're working for?"
Old habits die hard.<eos> You know, it's gonna be a real downer for your book if Hannah gets away.<eos> People who buy true crime stuff tend to like it when the bad guy gets caught.<eos> Maybe I can help you rewrite the ending.<eos> - So now you're an editor.<eos> - I'm thinking about Hannah's husband.<eos> Forty year olds don't just drop dead of a heart attack.<eos> I could have the body exhumed, test it for aconite.<eos> It's been 10 years.<eos> If it's there, the tox screen will find it.
If you want, I'll have the blood tested.<eos> Just say the word, we can spend the money.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> You smell that?<eos> - What?<eos> - Sulphur, mixed with shit.<eos> Means Isaak Sirko's attorney is on his way.<eos> They wanna run their own analysis on the samples we took from Mateo's.<eos> Confirm that it's his client's blood we found.<eos> - Masuka's grabbing it now. - I'll have it ready for them.
Hannah.<eos> - Hannah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That poor woman had to watch her dead brother be dug up. And for what?<eos> I put her through fucking hell.<eos> You couldn't anticipate this. It's not your fault.<eos> Well, it doesn't make it any better.<eos> Sometimes my job really fucking sucks.<eos> Actually, it always sucks.<eos> Why do you do it?
It sure is simpler to just pin all the blame on something else, isn't it, Dexter?<eos> It's much scarier to think that the Dark Passenger is no more real than I am.<eos> - This is where the cabin used to be.<eos> - Yeah before it got blown to smithereens.<eos> Juan Alonso?<eos> I'm Captain Maria LaGuerta from Miami Metro Homicide.<eos> - This is Thomas Matthews.<eos> - What do you want'?<eos> Were you the owner of this property back in 2007?<eos> And did you rent it, at that time, to a James Doakes?
- Couple days ago.<eos> She left you a note.<eos> It's in my locker.<eos> - I probably shouldn't have read it. - What did it say?<eos> She's sorry, but she needed a new start.<eos> Staying here was too hard for her.<eos> She was really broken up.<eos> That all?<eos> Oh, that you mean a lot to her and she'll never forget what you did for her.<eos> I'll be done in a few minutes and I can go get it.
Come on, dude. They're like 15, tops.<eos> I'm talking about the bike, you sick freak.<eos> I'm sorry. You know I'm a Bianchi guy.<eos> Adam, come on!<eos> Let's ride!<eos> 90 seconds.<eos> Come on. We need to go now! No.<eos> I'm starving!<eos> Dude, we're 15 minutes from losing everything.<eos> I'm gonna buy this burrito, Ders. And then I'm gonna eat it!
We were...<eos> We were just looking at... The... this, uh...<eos> Side of the car.<eos> It's nice.<eos> You know, it's...<eos> You know, the car, which is right back where you left it.<eos> And there's no reason to suspect otherwise. No.<eos> None whatsoever.<eos> - I think I've got a new passion for racing, actually-- - Whoa!<eos> You know, there's a whole shipment of "shut the hell up" downstairs. Why don't you unload it?
Good thing there's no naked flames about!<eos> Right...<eos> Off on the insulin round, and I'm under no illusions that it will be straightforward.<eos> They'll all have been at the Quality Street, every man jack of them.<eos> If I was the Prime Minister, I would shut that factory down.<eos> Is that Mrs Jenkins?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've never heard anything like it.<eos> I have.<eos> We used to call it "the workhouse howl".
Pink booties for a boy?<eos> There weren't any blue ones.<eos> One of the proper hue can be acquired...<eos> One of the proper hue can be purchased.<eos> Nurse Lee, take two shillings out of the petty cash and see that Sister Monica Joan's properly equipped.<eos> What are we going to call him, then?<eos> I worry we should leave that to his mother.<eos> I mean, she may come back, especially if it's reported in the papers.<eos> It is in fact customary to name an abandoned infant after somebody closely connected with its rescue.<eos> We can hardly call it Cynthia.
Like that.<eos> He may have had his faults, but we were great together.<eos> We had an unspoken language.<eos> We finished each other's balloon animals.<eos> But you would never know, because you have never been to one of our performances.<eos> Birthday parties.<eos> You hate my clown side. No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I don't hate it.
Somebody!<eos> Somebody! This isn't pretend!<eos> Someone grab an adult, please!<eos> Mitzi.<eos> Your kid forgot his cereal.<eos> There's a surprise in every box.<eos> Spoiler alert-- it's diabetes.<eos> You drove all the way over here for this?<eos> Okay, look, here's the deal.<eos> You can have that listing if you want it.
They're both gonna be just fine.<eos> Oh.<eos> You are a stubborn bitch. I know.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry I left you.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> The surgery was a success.<eos> We were able to insert the balloon into your boy's trachea. And his lungs will develop normally.<eos> We'll remove it a couple of weeks before labor.
Big deal.<eos> Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pigtailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys.<eos> Doesn't seem so macho now, does it?<eos> It's a jump rope!<eos> Dwight!<eos> Hey, I'm up here. Up the ladder.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Come here.<eos> Why do you want this cat?<eos> Um, I don't want it, really.
We catch them to make fish meal.<eos> Fish meal which feeds farmed fish.<eos> In total, 25 million tons of sea fish are raised every year, most of the production coming from Norway and Chile.<eos> We only raise species with high market value, sea bream, salmon and bass.<eos> Four kilos of wild sardines are needed to produce one kilo of farmed fish.<eos> Our fish farming is an industry based on a wild resource.<eos> And when there are no more sardines, what will we do?<eos> As our resources run out, we go further and further.<eos> The high seas are a free zone.<eos> Two-thirds of the ocean belongs to everyone, and so to no one, and so belongs to the first to use it.
Firm.<eos> Oh, you like firm?<eos> Oh, yeah. Firm rocks my world.<eos> You?<eos> Yeah. Yeah. I'm good with firm.<eos> What do you say we take it as evidence and take it back to my room?<eos> Oh, I got a better idea.<eos> Why don't you throw around that fancy title of yours, get the hotel to give you an upgrade?<eos> Are you suggesting that I exploit my position?<eos> Well, what's the point of having a fancy title if you can't, you know, exploit it a little?
My dog Chopin is coming for his first visit.<eos> Who the hell names a dog Chopin?<eos> Who names a man haskell?<eos> A woman who likes her cocktails.<eos> I know it seems like I'm fussing, but this dog is like my child. You know,<eos> I raised him from a pup.<eos> And it was tough, letting him go in the divorce. And he's coming to visit. I want everything to be perfect.<eos> What's that stink?<eos> Uh, it's the smell of the outdoors.<eos> No wonder I didn't recognize it.
- Karen!<eos> How you been, girl? I've been all right.<eos> I had a great time on our date.<eos> Prince concert. Madison square garden.<eos> Was the little purple man on fire or what?<eos> So, Phil... Why didn't you ever call?<eos> Karen, this is gonna sound like a line.<eos> That's why I'm hesitant to say it, all right?<eos> I lost your number.<eos> - Then let me give it to you. - Okay.
- Yeah.<eos> 3 years later, I get a call from Mogadishu.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That unsafe safe house.<eos> I got thank you for that one.<eos> - So who's your new best friend?<eos> - Niger SF.<eos> We train them. What were you doing in that compound, Damien?<eos> I was looking for a vacation home.<eos> Why were you bombing it?
It's scheduled to over night.<eos> Arrives in Ilizi this evening.<eos> It should be somewhere between here and here.<eos> It's already crossed into Algeria.<eos> Shit. You know what the Algerians are like about anybody operating inside their borders.<eos> They fired on an unauthorized French SF chopper last month.<eos> Bravo, you have wheels?<eos> Uh, yeah, I think we can arrange that.<eos> The package is on a bus headed to Ilizi.<eos> Hustle and you can catch it.
They'll be our presence on the scene and will liaise with Muskoka regional.<eos> Although the scene lies within Muskoka's jurisdiction, some of the victims, and possibly the killer, are from the GTA, so ours.<eos> The swamp lies between an access road and a major highway.<eos> Most of the cottages within the surrounding area have been closed for winter.<eos> Five women, one man, one undetermined, and a toddler in various states of decomposition.<eos> Plus skeletal fragments.<eos> Final tally will be higher.<eos> It's a hell of a way to cut case load at Missing Persons.<eos> Our latest presumed victim: 21-year-old theater student Aurora O'Donnell.<eos> We will live with this one for however long it takes, and remember it for the rest of our careers.
Thank you, dear.<eos> It's so cute, and chef Alan is a chef, so it's perfect!<eos> Of course it's perfect.<eos> It's as if someone with crystal eyes looked into your heart and crystallized your love for him.<eos> Pricey, though.<eos> Look, if you think I'm gonna pressure you into buying this 35-pound crystal chef's hat, I'm not.<eos> You're not?<eos> Of course not.<eos> This crystal was clearly made for chef Alan.<eos> If you don't buy it, I'm sure somebody else will.
Now, Bobo is here in case you feel the need to physicalize your anger, you can punch him in the face.<eos> All right, I'll give it a shot.<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> No. No. That's not Bobo.<eos> That's Ed. Look, I don't even belong here.<eos> The court just wants you to sign this piece of paper that says I showed up.<eos> You sign it now, I can bounce and you can check out my ass when I leave.<eos> I've already checked out your ass.<eos> It's one of the best ones in the group.<eos> It'll look even better if you put it in that chair so we can start.
Over here.<eos> Um, 1999. Knoxville, Tennessee.<eos> Thomas Huskey.<eos> A recent addition to our crime family.<eos> Huskey claimed he had a separate, darker personality called Kyle who was responsible for a series of murders.<eos> The defence argued that Kyle was to blame, and that Thomas was innocent.<eos> What, Thomas wasn't aware of what Kyle was doing?<eos> Mm. It's possible.<eos> The personalities, I think they call them 'alters', are formed to protect the person from traumatic memories.<eos> It starts in childhood where there is abuse, and then every time something terrible happens, another alter forms to take hold of the memory and keep it from them.
The whole thing.<eos> Dr. Webber, you know I love you, but I believe you stood me up at this dance before.<eos> But I am here with a new corsage.<eos> Dr. Grey.<eos> Neil Sheridan, 62, presents with short gut syndrome caused by a resection of the small intestine.<eos> Years of T.P.N. has caused the liver to fail, resulting in the need for a multi-organ transplant of the small intestine, large intestine, stomach, pancreas, and liver.<eos> All from one guy.<eos> Try to find that on Craigslist.<eos> And we've scheduled you for surgery today.<eos> I'll believe that when I see it.
Are you okay?<eos> I'm here.<eos> Are you feeling better?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm better.<eos> Cristina, um...<eos> I know that you don't want to talk about it, but... I'm here, so... I just want to stay on the phone with you until you want to hang up.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm here.<eos> The human body is made up of systems that keep it alive.
Ah, don't know. Some hikers found her.<eos> What is it, Karev?<eos> Uh, Jane Doe, looks to be around 15 years old.<eos> Hunt wants you to take a look at her.<eos> Hey, any word back on my interviews?<eos> Uh, yeah, I'm working on it.<eos> The angle's off on this elbow.<eos> You've been working on it for a couple of weeks now.<eos> Well, you're an acquired taste, like blue cheese.<eos> Some people love it and some people can't stand to be in the same room with it. They think it's stinky.
And I a thousand times.<eos> If you would rather I open her up and do tube duodenostomy, that's... fine, too.<eos> It's more invasive, but fine.<eos> Dr. Grey.<eos> Dr. Grey, we're gonna have to call this.<eos> You can take the exam again next year.<eos> And we won't... we won't count this as a failure<eos> - so please... - Okay, you're doctors. You can't handle a little vomit?<eos> Dr. Grey, it... it's really okay...<eos> I would repair it with an abdominal approach, reduce the size of the hernia contents, excise the sac, close the hiatus, and perform a floppy nissen for antireflux and gastropexy.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime parasite.<eos> I'm sorry if I find it a little more interesting right now than the crossword and garden salad.<eos> The patient is on antiparasitics.<eos> The worm is going to die.<eos> - There's nothing else you can do right now other than go to lunch.<eos> This is not like one of your movies where--where--where the larvae gestate in the brain, leaving the poor host a hollowed-out zombie whose bite will now infect the whole populous on the base.<eos> - What movie is that?<eos> - What? No, that sounds good.<eos> I haven't seen it.<eos> I made it up.
Got it.<eos> It was in C-4.<eos> All right, temp's down to 30 degrees.<eos> Cross-clamping the aorta.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's see what we're working with.<eos> Damn it.<eos> This wasn't in the scans.<eos> The tumor's infiltrated much deeper into the ventricle.<eos> Reconstructive ventriculoplasty isn't gonna cut it.
They, uh, gave me the international rotation and the moving expenses, and they took care of, uh, all my loans-- college, med school.<eos> Yes.<eos> They're even throwing in a mortgage allowance.<eos> I could buy a house.<eos> Good.<eos> They gave me everything I asked for.<eos> So did Hunt.<eos> Then... why the hell aren't you celebrating?<eos> No one's ever wanted me like this.<eos> You just don't recognize the view, Karev... the crowd going wild, people taking pictures, the snap of the tape as you break it.
You okay with that?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Mr. Vice President, my name is Tammi Chase.<eos> My mother, Sandra Chase, is dying in your prison in solitary.<eos> She has not had a trial, she has not been charged.<eos> Yet you are holding her, an innocent who's going to die on your watch if you don't do something, and do it today.<eos> I'm aware of the situation. I'd like to help but I'm afraid it will take more time than today.<eos> Our judicial system has been slow, inefficient, discriminatory and corrupt.<eos> If we don't recognize it, we'll never be able to change it.
Didn't want one.<eos> Was it Ridgeway?<eos> Did you kill him? I don't kill people.<eos> I hack.<eos> I haven't really left the van.<eos> No kidding. Next time, hacker, why don't you crack a window?<eos> This is all of Baylor's computer hardware.<eos> No sign of the rifle used to shoot Ridgeway in her van or in the apartment.<eos> Abby, you do know that AUTEC is just a facility where they run tests, right?<eos> No, Tim, it is a potluck of the unexplained, and this scientist is eating it up; you know why?
And yours is this.<eos> So you make the letter "W" and then you swoosh it back like you're sweeping back your hair.<eos> That's a little vain, isn't it?<eos> You are a little vain.<eos> You got me there.<eos> Perfect!<eos> I think I want a new one.<eos> Wouldn't it be cooler if my name sign was this?<eos> Well, you can't pick your own name sign.<eos> A deaf person has to give it to you.
What? The key to the diamonds? Yeah.<eos> I mean, he looked really happy that key was in there.<eos> If that's what they're after, then why is the key still there? All right.<eos> There were 86 minutes they were in that bank that we couldn't account for, right?<eos> What if they copied the key? Right.<eos> So th-they take the money, hit the other boxes.<eos> Cushman thinks it's a normal robbery.<eos> But... but still, th-the key to what?<eos> Can you look up a place called Dye Norwood?<eos> They were staking it out, I think, from those photos.
- Look, how pretty!<eos> Still a bit glum, but...<eos> Shall we take another one'?<eos> Great, now you've got an avatar.<eos> Zehra, don't make such a noise chewing!<eos> - What is that'?<eos> - What a bloody idiot!<eos> I don't want this profile thing any more.<eos> Don't worry, it's someone ease's.<eos> Is this the 1 st time you see it'?
Great, now you've got an avatar.<eos> Zehra, don't make such a noise chewing!<eos> - What is that'?<eos> - What a bloody idiot!<eos> I don't want this profile thing any more.<eos> Don't worry, it's someone ease's.<eos> Is this the 1 st time you see it'?<eos> Not the best example for the first sight.<eos> Remove it, turn it off!<eos> If I was him, I'd not display it.
Uh, yes. I'm sorry?<eos> Uh, I usually like to put mine on my lap, but okay.<eos> Oh, I just don't want to spill on my dress.<eos> Spill what?<eos> So, what's going on?<eos> Oh, you know, I just... I wanted to stop playing grown up and escape the world up there for a minute.<eos> That's not true.<eos> This isn't my dress.<eos> This is Nina Garcia's backup dress. And when her assistant said that she didn't need it<eos> I thought, "Well, what could it hurt to wear it?"
Uh, bedroom tips... No need.<eos> Got it.<eos> Your liver's enlarged.<eos> Do you drink alcohol?<eos> Look, doctor. I am Russian.<eos> We drink alcohol, okay?<eos> I should draw blood to test your liver function.<eos> The liver can affect diabetes and cause E.D.<eos> You look at my blood?<eos> No, I send it to a lab. No.
He doesn't want anything to do with the baby.<eos> So we're all gonna have to help Riley as much as we can, yeah?<eos> I thought you were a virgin.<eos> I can't do it, Mia.<eos> I just can't.<eos> I'm gonna go to the police.<eos> What, give birth in prison?<eos> Listen to me, Riley.<eos> He deserved to die, and you deserve to live.<eos> When that little baby comes, you're gonna love it more than anything you've ever loved in your life.
What you doing?<eos> I think she's had a shit.<eos> Is your baby gonna smell like that?<eos> All babies smell like that.<eos> -Have you got any nappies?<eos> - No.<eos> Have you got anything?<eos> Why'd you bring her here?<eos> Mum can't cope.<eos> Right, you get the food out of t'bucket and put it in t'trays.
No, Lydia, don't strain yourself.<eos> I don't want my mother to know about this, all right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, I won't tell her.<eos> Did you sleep here?<eos> I didn't sleep.<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> You can see when Jane gets here.<eos> Look what I found in my closet.<eos> Shane even signed it.
Help<eos> - Uh, yes, of course.<eos> Good.<eos> We'll need a coffin as well.<eos> Nothing too fancy.<eos> - A coffin?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Down there.<eos> After Antonio vanished, Ben here took over his accounts and four weeks in, he found something.<eos> Antonio was stealing money from customers and hiding it with losses on fictional investments.
I wonder if Klaus found your note yet.<eos> My note?<eos> Yeah, you know, the "I'm leaving you at the altar" note.<eos> Is that a thing?<eos> When you leave someone at the altar, you always leave a note.<eos> It's common courtesy.<eos> I think common courtesy went out the window when I did.<eos> Look, when Stella left me at the altar, at least I got an explanation.<eos> I mean, that note is what keeps you sane.<eos> You read it, you re-read it, you memorize it, you sleep with it, you sniff it because it still kind of smells like her, and then, finally... you let it go... tied to a brick, right through her perfect
Back off!<eos> I know what I'm doing!<eos> Card is spooked.<eos> If I had pushed too hard, he would've shut down.<eos> Give me time.<eos> I'll reel him in.<eos> I will get what we need.<eos> You better.<eos> Oh, nice necklace.<eos> You know, I think I have a matching bracelet if you'd like to borrow it sometime.
Good night, love.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're killing her!<eos> Carl, give me your hands.<eos> Carl, please.<eos> You should keep the site clean, okay?<eos> If I cut too deep, I'm gonna cut the baby.<eos> Good, come on.<eos> I see it. I see the ears.<eos> I'm gonna pull it out.
Me, too.<eos> I'm In.<eos> I got the flash bangs and I got the tear gas.<eos> You never know what you're gonna need.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, don't you worry about your old man.<eos> I'm gonna keep my eye on him.<eos> - Wasn't this place overrun?<eos> - It was.<eos> And you cleared it out all by yourselves?
Objection!<eos> Helen!<eos> Ms Grainger!<eos> You got to help me find Justin!<eos> Did you find out anything about that address I gave you?<eos> Mashta Fembwick?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - No.<eos> Shit...<eos> If a tree wins the lottery in a forest and nobody hears it, did it really win the lottery?
A hell of a lot more than I'm liking any of you right now.<eos> Anyway, what about you, little miss oligarch, why can't you break off 20 mil?<eos> It's gonna take a few days at least.<eos> That's not the point, okay?<eos> If Damascus is willing to meet us tomorrow.<eos> If we postpone, he'll start asking questions, get suspicious.<eos> Is there any way we can fake the money?<eos> A guy like Damascus will see that coming.<eos> It's only two hours.<eos> Okay, when Damascus dumps the money, we get into his system, we find Percy's account, we empty it.
Division.<eos> So Percy's stuffing his mattress with my money.<eos> He's not stuffing anything, okay?<eos> Damascus wanted us to get bearer bonds because they're small and they're portable, but like you said, they're illegal in the United States.<eos> So if he wants to use the money, he has to convert it all into cash.<eos> That's right.<eos> And that's good because we take cash.<eos> 70 million doesn't just fit into an easy-to-steal briefcase or three.<eos> We're talking about a truck here.<eos> If we find it, we hijack it.

The only reason she helped us is because Division turned on her.<eos> We were the enemy of her enemy.<eos> It doesn't mean everyone in the government is our enemy.<eos> If you don't count Madeline, what about Ryan?<eos> Ryan got screwed over by the system almost as badly as I did.<eos> Michael, social services dumped me with Gary.<eos> Corrupt cops shook down Carla to steal her money, and they killed my friend.<eos> The bureau of prisons helped fake my death.<eos> This government has always treated me like I was expendable.<eos> And I'm gonna save it anyway.
I think that's where the bomb could be.<eos> She's got something behind her back.<eos> Callen, what the hell?<eos> Ambrose, she's got a bomb. Mia, do not turn on that recorder.<eos> Listen to us, Mia.<eos> I already have.<eos> Mia, do not move.<eos> Do not take your finger off that button.<eos> It's gonna be okay, Mia.<eos> I'm gonna take it off you.
One more time.<eos> Excuse me. Who are you?<eos> What?<eos> Who?<eos> Who, me?<eos> You don't work here.<eos> Oh, I'm actually, uh... I'm a private nurse.<eos> I'm Mr. Edelstein's home health care provider.<eos> My patient pulled his catheter out again.<eos> I need somebody to hold him down while I put it back in.
We'll notify M.E.<eos> Arson Unit's on the way.<eos> Better call the Navy, too.<eos> ♪ NCIS 9x21 ♪ Rekindled Original Air Date on April 17, 2012<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman ==<eos> ♪<eos> What is this place?<eos> Warehouse is owned by United Equinox Electronics.<eos> They make everything from modems to toaster ovens.<eos> And according to insurance records, they use it to store tax records, corporate documents.
He must've been an imposter, a poser.<eos> Well, he's been a suspect in several arsons for hire.<eos> None of them were proven.<eos> I guess if you have a... a fake Windbreaker and a Photoshopped ID...<eos> I was homicide till two months ago.<eos> There're nearly 2,000 firefighters in the department.<eos> I missed it.<eos> I-I'm sorry, Agent Gibbs.<eos> Abbs, what's the last known address for him?<eos> Um, I'll send it to McGee.
I didn't steal your money.<eos> Why don't you stop talking now, before the hole you're digging becomes deep enough to bury you in?<eos> That money is one thing, we can deal with that later. Right now--<eos> Right now, what I want is my little blue book.<eos> - Hey, come on.<eos> You see that book has all the names, and more importantly the money, that each of those names owes me.<eos> Now I know you swiped it from my club, so don't try and talk your way out of this Kathleen.<eos> I understand why someone would take money. Why would-<eos> - Why would you take a book?<eos> How do I know you're going to leave me alone if I give it back to you?

I promise you if you don't give it to me, I will never leave you alone. Is that clear enough?
If you ask me everything, what for you're here then? You come.<eos> - It's near the pole, see!<eos> Don't I've any personal work?<eos> I'm not comfortable here, sir, can we sit there?<eos> The dish I ordered now is Folio Desate.<eos> In Greek it means dish of romance!<eos> There's a colourful flashback behind this dish,<eos> Julius Caesar shared this dish with Cleopatra.<eos> Whichever couple shares this dish together...<eos> I mean if you and I share it...
- Champagne? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Did you not hear me?<eos> I'm broke.<eos> You have no reason to suck up to me anymore.<eos> Well, I do if I want you to work here.<eos> You see, you're like a...<eos> a shopping savant, and every day, women come in here with all the money in the world and no clue what to spend it on.<eos> You could help them.<eos> You mean like a personal shopper job?<eos> No, do not think of it as a job.
Boy, does that bring back memories.<eos> New hobby?<eos> Oh, M.J. and I are building this soapbox thingy car for the school's big race.<eos> You should get Tom to help.<eos> He did it with all our boys.<eos> It's how they learned to swear. Oh.<eos> That's okay. I'll figure it out.<eos> I am telling you, he loves this stuff.<eos> I'm gonna give him a call.<eos> Oh, thanks, but I really think it's better if I do it myself.
It's downstairs. - Huh?<eos> What?<eos> - My special thing.<eos> Holy crepes.<eos> Come on.<eos> That's the thing...<eos> my special thing.<eos> A Martian transporter.<eos> [Gasps] This can take me to Mars?<eos> Yeah. My brothers gave it to me when they banished me to Earth.
Really?<eos> What if they, like-- I don't know-- stampede or something?<eos> I think we'll be better off with live horses in the morning.<eos> I need to speak to Campbell now.<eos> If she's in a meeting, pull her out.<eos> If she's with the Director--<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Yeah, thanks, yeah.<eos> Susan, Stan McQueen.<eos> Yeah, listen, I got a bit of a situation here, and I was wondering-- well, I don't know if I'd call it "cashing in my chips."
Was it the idiots down at the loading dock?<eos> - Forget the loading dock...<eos> - Can't think of anybody?<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> It's my office.<eos> Mike has an office.<eos> Ed called us here.<eos> He's not gonna change my mind, pop.<eos> I'd rather build taco stands for the rest of my life than have him cosign a loan and lord it over me.
Jesus.<eos> Hey.<eos> All right, I'm sorry.<eos> Okay, all right, okay.<eos> Okay, it's all right.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> All right.<eos> I owe you a blow job.<eos> You know what, don't worry about it.<eos> No, I owe it to you.
But I could still hear noises, like grunting and groaning sounds.<eos> So I got my flashlight and I went downstairs, and that's when I saw my daddy with the knife.<eos> What was he doing with the knife?<eos> Hurting mommy.<eos> Hurting her how?<eos> Can you show me?<eos> Like this.<eos> Lydia, your daddy said he was pulling the knife out.<eos> Is that possible?<eos> Pulling it out and putting it in.
- Thought you said Torrio.<eos> I want you to listen closely.<eos> My brother is there.<eos> You find him. You put him on.<eos> Nah, there's nobody's brother.<eos> Elias Thompson.<eos> He's there.<eos> He has to call me at...<eos> - What's the number?<eos> - You don't know it?
All the opposite.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> Fabrizio.<eos> Nina.<eos> I think I have something of yours.<eos> I doubt that...<eos> "Nine wishes", "questions to the heavens", "alas my destiny hasn't changed"...<eos> My notebook!<eos> Thanks! You have it.<eos> As of tomorrow, I'll carry it with me, so if you decide to keep following me, I'll give it back.
Officer on deck!<eos> Outside.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> - Answer me.<eos> - Nothing, sir!<eos> Well, maybe there's hope for you yet.<eos> Sir?<eos> There's a soldier inside of you, Thomas.<eos> I can see it.<eos> Everyone can see it.
- Dad, I'm 18.<eos> - I know.<eos> I know.<eos> It's just...<eos> You're gonna see plenty of reality in your lifetime.<eos> I just would like you to keep the rose color on your glasses for as long as possible.<eos> But I'm trying not to focus on the ugly side of it, dad.<eos> I-I've gotten straight a's, awards, more trophies than I can count.<eos> This job is the first thing that's made me feel like I'm doing something important, valuable.<eos> I mean, isn't that why you do it?
What's he gonna do?<eos> People are in danger.<eos> He grabs a man in a black hoodie, thinking it's the thief. - What's your problem?<eos> You don't like what I have to say?<eos> - Sorry. Huh?<eos> Can't face the truth?<eos> But it's Andrew Haynes.<eos> takeover! Wall Street! takeover!<eos> But by now, Bobby's decided taking the backpack wasn't such a good idea. takeover! Wall Street!<eos> So he ditches it and keeps moving.
Good morning, sunshine.<eos> If you came here to rescue me... You might want a do-over.<eos> I trust you had a pleasant nap, Ms. Clarke.<eos> Rather than waste my time on a wild goose chase, I thought I'd give you the opportunity to tell me where you've hidden Grayson's evidence.<eos> In return, I may even let your friend here live.<eos> Actually... He doesn't concern me.<eos> Gee, don't sugarcoat it, Ems.<eos> Well, if that's the case, I take back my offer.<eos> The evidence that you want is in locker 428 at the Port Authority Bus Terminal.<eos> The orange key from my keychain will open it.
Cassie? John Paul.<eos> I think it's time you and your crew paid up and left, don't you?<eos> You know the next copper I see on his own, I'm going to 'ammer him.<eos> ANDY!<eos> Where were you when it happened?<eos> Andy!<eos> Andy!<eos> They kicked the shit out of him.<eos> Your sarge mentioned your mate's number.<eos> No-one can tell me he didn't deserve it.
What the hell?<eos> I turn my phone off for a few hours and you go find yourself another date?<eos> It's not a date and you didn't tell me you were coming.<eos> I wanted to surprise you!<eos> Yeah, I guess you're full of surprises.<eos> _<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - He wants to know how your paper's going.<eos> It's great, man.<eos> I'll let you read it.
Like she got some kind of thing called coochie mold. - What?<eos> - Awesome, dude.<eos> I actually just won a foot race, so I'm entitled to the best bed.<eos> So is that in the front?<eos> Hey, you can't use this any more, dummy.<eos> I'm living in there. Okay, for sure.<eos> Like, what the happened to my life?<eos> I had it all.<eos> Tell you what, man, if I catch this dude, I'm gonna cut his dick off.<eos> I'm just gonna take it and just rip it. I'll put it in a microwave and cook it.
He ran. - No. No.<eos> No. No. No.<eos> Violet, that is not what I meant.<eos> - Charlotte, help me out here, please.<eos> - Well, he coulda run.<eos> - Charlotte!<eos> - I'm being honest with her. - He ran. He ran.<eos> - No.<eos> - Violet<eos> - Damn it! A couple weeks ago, we were out for a walk, and Lucas saw a plane, and he pointed up to it, and Pete said, "Let's go.
Oh, I know I didn't call you back five years ago.<eos> Well, I hope your jury consulting is better than your memory.<eos> I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.<eos> Because you know I'm right.<eos> Because I'm a bigger person.<eos> Which is why I'm gonna come in.<eos> But I want to know, why'd you call me instead of Ted Phillips?<eos> Why do you think?<eos> They had the document.<eos> They kept it to themselves, and then they destroyed it.
What are we gonna do?<eos> No, it's okay. Relax.<eos> No big deal. We just have to go home and climb through the dumpster.<eos> No, seriously, what are we gonna do?<eos> Ready?<eos> Well, let's get to it. My garbage ain't gonna find itself. Max, I can't.<eos> If I go in there, I will literally be white trash.<eos> Look, you're the one who had to butt in and get all "Wharton" with Earl.<eos> If you had left him alone, it would be at the post office safe and sound. Fine.<eos> But to be clear, if we find a baby in there, you're raising it on your own.
Forget the car!<eos> Trina, back inside.<eos> Open the sunroof.<eos> Open the sunroof!<eos> It's okay, come on.<eos> Okay, ready?<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Okay, round you go.<eos> The prototype. It's gone.<eos> We lost it.
Fine.<eos> Everybody was buzzing about it since the rich old fella died, and she never got a dime.<eos> She's, uh, living in some dive somewhere now.<eos> Some dive somewhere?<eos> You got an address?<eos> I can't really remember.<eos> Alright, Finn, look. This is the last five bucks I got to my name.<eos> Can't fault a guy for trying.<eos> Give me the address.<eos> Alright, hold on now, luh, I'll right it down for you.
You know what?<eos> Don't even say a word.<eos> You take this so personal, Jake.<eos> It's funny how I'm human like that.<eos> I'm just trying to make my way in the world.<eos> No matter what you say you know that.<eos> Part of you even likes it.<eos> I have to admit there's an insane charm about you.<eos> I need the violin.<eos> So, what? You expect me to just hand it over to you right now?
Bigfoot can't do anything.<eos> He's not real. That's what they said about the moon landing.<eos> I believe you've had a cocktail.<eos> Men have cocktails. Carrie Bradshaw has drinks.<eos> Nope, the other way around.<eos> Doesn't matter. I'm fun Don tonight.<eos> I love fun Don.<eos> - Where have I seen this dress before?<eos> - On Lisa. - She let me raid her closet.<eos> - I think you should never take it off. Except when you take it off.
A year or so ago they did a Mini, but at the back, it had a wickerwork picnic hamper and a silver tea set.<eos> The point is, we would like to extend an invitation to people of Germany to come over here, not in a bomber...<eos> Not all at once.<eos> Not in uniform, marching...<eos> And not at night.<eos> No, not at night, but come over here as tourists and we'll show you the Shard, for example, in London. Modern skyscraper.<eos> We'll show you the Range Rover Evoque.<eos> We'll take you to an Adele gig.<eos> Maybe not Adele.<eos> Not if ITV are covering it, cos you'll just get that...
200 yards ahead.<eos> 300 yards ahead.<eos> So on a track, the Maserati is better.<eos> However, as an everyday road car, there are some issues, chief among which are the racing harnesses.<eos> Look at this - honestly, it's like something out of an SM catalogue.<eos> It means you can't reach the glove box.<eos> You can't reach car park pay machines or tollbooths.<eos> They couldn't have ruined the car more if they'd smeared the carpets with dog dirt.<eos> And even if you ignore the bondage gear, all is still not well.<eos> If you take the gearbox out of race mode and put it in everyday "going to the shops" auto, it sits down there, in the bowels of the car thinking,
Found him.<eos> He was looking for ice.<eos> Oh, there you are.<eos> Listen, I need an executive chef for the new restaurant, and I want it to be you. You haven't even tasted my food.<eos> Well, taste is overrated.<eos> Trust me. Food is all about the hype.<eos> People pay 100 bucks for a burger because they think it's from a Japanese cow.<eos> It's the sizzle that sells, and I like your sizzle.<eos> This whole ninja vibe you've got going on.<eos> Customers are gonna love it.
I'm just saying, we'd be better off running a stock scam Or maybe a little heist.<eos> Hey, the government's just a system, baby.<eos> And if it's a system, we can hack it. I already got The cheerleader protection act, H.R. 505, up for vote<eos> In about 20 minutes.<eos> Poor bastards won't know what hit them. Right.<eos> Assuming it passes.<eos> Assuming what? It's a bill to keep high-school girls out of wheelchairs.<eos> Who's gonna vote against it? Ladies and gentlemen, this bill is a staggering...<eos> I say a staggering overreach of government power.<eos> How the hell did this bill come up for a vote Without us knowing about it?
Goodnight.<eos> I left my book.<eos> What book is that?<eos> Just my book.<eos> That's your book?<eos> Fifty Spices?<eos> Yes.<eos> Tom, where did you get a book like that?<eos> I fired someone for reading that book at work.<eos> And then you kept it?
I left my book.<eos> What book is that?<eos> Just my book.<eos> That's your book?<eos> Fifty Spices?<eos> Yes.<eos> Tom, where did you get a book like that?<eos> I fired someone for reading that book at work.<eos> And then you kept it?<eos> I kept it, but I didn't read it at work.
If you want to change the world you have to leave the living room first.<eos> I don't know how to tell you this, I'm missing a piece.<eos> If I'm ever going to get home the last thing I need is a trail that leads here.<eos> A girl's gotta have secrets.<eos> We've got intel.<eos> Liber8 is among the leading edge.<eos> Fall in.<eos> What a waste!<eos> Liber8 calls themselves revolutionaries but all I see are vandals with no respect for private property.<eos> If there's a message I'm not getting it.
Oh, God.<eos> Honey, where's your ticket?<eos> I had it.<eos> It was in my pocket.<eos> Tickets?<eos> Here you are.<eos> So, ma mystère.<eos> Jean Mettier's legendary first painting, and there are no pictures of it, no reproductions.<eos> It's never been sold or exhibited.<eos> He... he described it once as his inspiration.
The interpol agent found out about the forgeries. Woody, they know.<eos> They know about the paintings.<eos> Aah!<eos> You'd, um, switch out one painting every couple of months.<eos> Nice.<eos> When did you decide to go after ma mystère?<eos> When I saw the keypad, and I knew the numbers.<eos> You painted the duplicate in advance.<eos> Of course, you'd, um, have to guess what it looked like.<eos> No one else had seen it.
what did you see in them? We saw in them a dynamic that, um... Well, she was a little over the top.<eos> Your casting note said, "loud and trashy."<eos> He was repressed.<eos> Opposites of sorts.<eos> It makes for good conflict.<eos> Tina mentioned that the producers would also manufacture conflict if need be.<eos> It may have happened.<eos> Mind telling us how?<eos> It's called "poking the bear."<eos> We basically solicit a provocative comment from one cast member, play it for the other, and suddenly, we have a fight.
She's 93.<eos> She won't be disappointed for very long.<eos> No, hang on.<eos> I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement.<eos> I made a written record request 72 hours in advance.<eos> I checked the tire pressure on the car.<eos> I even contacted the Centers For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County.<eos> FYI, it's none.<eos> Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way.<eos> You use it to get your way.
It's natural if we're threatened to assert authority, - impose rules.<eos> - He can't help it. - Doesn't even try.<eos> - I was talking about you.<eos> How many times have you changed your shirt today?<eos> Three times.<eos> It would have been more but I ran out.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Trust me.<eos> It's a thought stopper.<eos> When you feel the need to control things, you snap it hard. And you won't need to change your shirt, or... lay down the rules, or whatever it is you do at the moment.
Nothing else will work.<eos> The keys belonged to the warden.<eos> Warden James?<eos> We have a strong suspicion that Tommy Madsen works for him and that the warden is behind all of this.<eos> What's that?<eos> That measures thermal and seismic activities.<eos> There's a theory...<eos> That the jump was caused by a geothermal event.<eos> Possibly a tectonic plate slippage.<eos> You call it a jump too?
- Tom.<eos> No. You sit.<eos> You're forgetting something.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Beulah's mastitis.<eos> I don't just walk out on my patients, guys.<eos> You guys are both very similar.<eos> All right, here's what's gonna happen.<eos> Divya, you find his tooth, but don't touch the root. That can disturb cells that attach it to the bone.<eos> The sooner we get it back in the socket, the better.
Knox would have been put out to pasture, and the nukes turned over to the UN in a couple of years. Huh.<eos> Wishful thinking must be a symptom of advancing years because what I saw was you fostering a wave of anarchy across Africa, with a zealot like Conrad Knox at its heart.<eos> A zealot you put on the run.<eos> He's the most wanted man in the world, with two nukes up for sale.<eos> He's not selling.<eos> Not his character.<eos> So now you're gonna shrink him?<eos> You went balls out on Knox, and it backfired... big-time.<eos> I'm asking myself how we're even in this mess when you've got a man like Damien Scott on your team?<eos> Someone I know who will take an order and see it through, even if it means laying down his life.
Got him.<eos> Just a cell phone.<eos> What the hell is he doing?<eos> I need to take this.<eos> Put the phone down now!<eos> You need me to take this, Agent Callen.<eos> Callen!<eos> Help me!<eos> What is it?<eos> Pulling it up.
If you'd shared operational details, this would never have happened.<eos> Your assumption, Henrietta, that your involvement would have resulted in a different outcome is egotistical, and it exposes your greatest weakness.<eos> I should have been informed.<eos> You didn't need to know.<eos> Uh, guys?<eos> Um, I mean... Cell phone's been turned on.<eos> And we have a GPS fix.<eos> What do you got, Eric?<eos> Cell phone's been turned on.<eos> GPS puts it at an abandoned freight warehouse downtown.
And, Wilke, start texting.<eos> Action.<eos> Get in closer.<eos> Coming up on Wilke... that's your cue.<eos> Wilke, that's your cue.<eos> Well, cut!<eos> Don't look in the camera!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Um, I think I have your phone.<eos> You probably shouldn't leave it lying around.
Oh, I am so rude.<eos> I forgot to give you your hostess gift.<eos> A bottle of whispering angel rose.<eos> It's my favorite.<eos> I drink it like kool-aid.<eos> Do you?<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> I have been on an 800-calorie-a-day diet of sea grains for six months.<eos> I have been sober for 80 hours.<eos> I'm just gonna have a little teaspoon of the jambalaya, and I'm gonna spit it out.
When we was young, I didn't have all that Atari or PlayStation.<eos> We did basketball in the rain. We didn't care if it was snowing, sleeting, raining.<eos> This is what we did, it's in my blood.<eos> The heat didn't matter.<eos> We're talking about minimal water.<eos> The fountain used to work from time to time, and there was no bottled water back then.<eos> We would go up to a friend's house up here, or someone would bring a big jug of water down, we'd all drink from the same jug.<eos> You know, that's the way it was.<eos> No Gatorade.<eos> Although basketball was conceived as an indoor team sport, New Yorkers took the game outdoors, reinvented it, and started adding their own style and creativity to how it could be played.
He'll shoot you.<eos> Right back to Yugoslavia.<eos> For legendary players, park nicknames last forever.<eos> Look at this guy.<eos> I mean, you know who we are.<eos> I mean, I don't have to say my name.<eos> I mean, you know, I mean...<eos> Everybody know the Fly.<eos> Anybody who know about this blacktop know about the Fly.<eos> So, I mean, I don't have to say my name, but I'll say it for you.
Hey, Santa, I was thinking.<eos> How about a little raise?<eos> Santa!<eos> What about me?<eos> - What was that?<eos> All right, men.<eos> This is gonna be a simple in and out operation.<eos> I've got a top-notch security system.<eos> It's like Fort Knox.<eos> You guys will never get past it.
Everyone says that love happens when you least expect it.
Do I still look like a whore?<eos> Untie me, bitch.<eos> Now!<eos> Is that sexy?<eos> Judge, if I could?<eos> -You may.<eos> -lf the defendant climbed on top of Jeffrey Wright. Something like this, and straddled him. And she is right-handed.<eos> And how do you think she held the knife?<eos> Ifyou don't untie me, I swear to God, I am gonna...<eos> You can just put it in my hand.
She was in the field when I went to her farm to pick up a cow.<eos> I had the ring because I thought it was a good chance.<eos> Like they say, Strike while the iron's hot!<eos> She was with her mother in the rice paddies.<eos> I gave it to her and it fell in the cesspit!<eos> In the cesspit!<eos> We looked hard for it but never found it.<eos> When we moved here, we promised to look for it someday.<eos> But that day never came.<eos> Maybe the tsunami got it.
In the beginning... there was blood.<eos> The land demands it.
The superman case says no one can sign away their right to terminate, ever. But she did.<eos> Ms. Reed, termination rights do not apply to work-for-hire.<eos> Your contract does say work-for-hire. But since she brought this to you, it also refers to her as an author, so... which one did you mean?<eos> You don't seriously expect to get this past a judge.<eos> It got past one before.<eos> What is he talking about?<eos> The case is Community vs. Reed.<eos> Not Ms. Reed here, some other Reed.<eos> To be work-for-hire, Ashley's work has to be<eos> "a contribution to a collective work, specially ordered" "and/or commissioned, and have a written agreement" "calling it work-for-hire."
You go to bed while Daddy tells us all about his birthday party.<eos> Where was it?<eos> Mexico?<eos> Yeah. Great food in Mexico.<eos> This is like Hammerhead.<eos> I'm looking for the exit!<eos> How far into your career with Blur was it that the fans discovered that your first love was cheese?<eos> Oh, before...<eos> I mean...<eos> They presented it to me in hotel lobbies.
Without his help, and his skill, this would not have been possible.<eos> To our new friend.<eos> To our new friend, cheers.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What does that stand for?<eos> It never brought me any luck.<eos> It's uh... it's just a reminder.<eos> It's surrounded by scar tissue.<eos> I've tried to cut it off, but it keeps coming back.<eos> I can't even feel it anymore.
Oh, I'm sure.<eos> Our evidence links your priority client to a murder.<eos> Ah, yes, of course.<eos> The infamous stained dress, yeah.<eos> By the way-- sorry-- but who is this guy?<eos> - His name is CSI Eric Delko. - Ah.<eos> CSI Eric Delko. Oh.<eos> One of Miami's finest foot soldiers, no doubt.<eos> Gabby, where are we at here?<eos> So, after collecting this stained dress from Denise Baines' apartment, CSI Delko, where did you put it?
'Can honour set to a leg? No.<eos> Or an arm?<eos> 'Or take away the grief of a wound?<eos> 'Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? No.<eos> 'What is honour?<eos> 'What is in that word honour?<eos> What is that honour?<eos> 'Air.<eos> A trim reckoning.<eos> 'Who hath it?
That's what the $4,000 was for.<eos> She was gonna bid on a unit.<eos> Which unit?<eos> Beats me.<eos> Could be any one of the 14 we got up for bid.<eos> So there's no way of telling which one she was interested in?<eos> Actually, there is a way.<eos> We misinterpreted Wendy's message.<eos> It's not "lie."<eos> We were looking at it upside down.
What did they take?<eos> My bracelet made out of pink diamonds that was worth over $4 million.<eos> Wendell stole the bracelet.<eos> That's what's in the storage unit.<eos> That's why he was killed.<eos> What are you so happy about?<eos> There is a $4-million diamond bracelet buried in my auction winnings.<eos> I'm rich.<eos> Or richer.<eos> Till detective Beckett takes it from you and returns it to its rightful owner.
I don't get it.<eos> All of the evidence, Wendy's murder-- everything points to the fact that that bracelet should be in there.<eos> Well, it's not.<eos> I did, however, make some headway on my little stick man theory.<eos> Really?<eos> Whilst you were still an officer, you risked your life running into traffic to save an old gypsy woman.<eos> A gypsy woman?<eos> An old gypsy woman.<eos> To reward your bravery, she gave you a talisman.<eos> Mm-hmm. She said, as long as you keep it. No harm will ever befall you.
Once again, I didn't tell...<eos> Why didn't she write back? !<eos> Maybe she's busy.<eos> Maybe she's trapped under something heavy.<eos> She's not.<eos> What if... there's been a zombie outbreak at her office and she's holed up someplace waiting for me.<eos> If they've breached the perimeter of the building, then... wait, are we doing this?<eos> Three hours ago, I was in charge of this text conversation, and now I'm not.<eos> And I blame you and your hat.<eos> [ Inhales sharply ] Just because you took it off doesn't mean you're not still wearing it.
She just ditches me the second her boyfriend shows up.<eos> Who does that?<eos> Certainly not the kind of person I want to open a bakery with.<eos> So, do you, or do you not have a girlfriend?<eos> That's what I want to know.<eos> I'm sorry. You don't want to hear about this.<eos> The point is you're single. I'm single.<eos> I've been single my whole life, probably has something to do with my mother.<eos> Like, today, she leaves me this message and... you know what?<eos> It's better if you hear it.

I need to take leave.<eos> Family emergency.<eos> You don't have any family, Reese.<eos> And I've been assured that the situation is urgent.<eos> - So find someone else.<eos> - There's no time to find someone else.<eos> We've lost control of a certain item.<eos> Securing it is the highest priority. - Do you understand?<eos> - We understand.<eos> You lost something, you need us to get it back.
Absolutely.<eos> - Anything yet, Finch? Yes, as a matter of fact.<eos> One number in her call history comes up several times in the last hour.<eos> No name on the account.<eos> Could be Tommy on a burner phone. - Can you track him?<eos> We'll see.<eos> I'm texting him an alluring photo from Ashley's archive, hoping it'll get a quick response.<eos> When he opens the message, a spyware Trojan embedded in the file will send his GPS coordinates. Good.<eos> Mr. Reese, I got a hit on Tommy's burner phone.<eos> He last checked it from the Royce Motel.
Mostly alive.<eos> MAN<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said he wanted something for the pain.<eos> Action here was clean fast.<eos> BMR recon team, maybe, or hired guns.<eos> Looks like the package.<eos> Why kill all these people and leave it behind?<eos> Maybe they copied it.<eos> Altered it and left it for us to find.
Now, Mary, you listen to me.<eos> I'm one-third your father and you're gonna come back.<eos> If y'all will excuse me, I gotta freshen up for the ride home.<eos> Enjoy your fancy-schmancy in-house for the last time.<eos> Um, I've got to go. Go where?<eos> Uh, well, since we're here,<eos> I'm gonna go try to get Al Roker's autograph.<eos> Here you go, little fan. Killer storm on the way.<eos> Um, I gonna go try to sell this.<eos> I'll buy it back.
Writing that letter to Jenna was terrible.<eos> - Agreed.<eos> - And cruel.<eos> - I get it. - No, you don't.<eos> But I do, because despite how together I may seem I was once a misfit too.<eos> Yeah, I know it's hard to believe, but things weren't always smooth sailing for this old kimosabe.<eos> And do you know who always lifted me up?<eos> - Your mother.<eos> - That's right. And let me tell you, I was pretty heavy back then.<eos> I had a tendency to eat my feelings, but no matter how heavy my load or my ass, my mother could always lighten it with her unconditional love because that is what good mothers do.
Well, dad, luckily you can't teach that kind of crazy. You just gotta be born with it.<eos> We need to find her, you guys, before she disappears.<eos> Catching her is the only way to clear your name.<eos> Yeah, well if that gold is what she was after, I doubt she's just gonna pack up and walk away.<eos> Sonja.<eos> How are you?<eos> Dandy.<eos> Thanks for askin'.<eos> I need it, Mal.<eos> Why don't you uh, come on over here and get it?
Mabel and Ivy are leaving too. What?<eos> Well, I tried to persuade them to stay on, but they won't.<eos> They're scared.<eos> I'm sorry, Ladyship.<eos> I truly am.<eos> "Mr Litton died in such strange circumstances.<eos> I wish you were here to help.<eos> Your loving Emily."<eos> This is the advertisement I've written for a housekeeper and maids.<eos> Alec will ride into Ashbourne with it today. Mm-hm.
What about me?<eos> You move on. You pick yourself up. You learn from your mistakes.<eos> I honestly don't even know what to do with myself.<eos> I liked that job.<eos> You know, I finally felt like I was starting a new chapter in my life.<eos> Well, you'll be happy to know that that chapter's still open for you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I spoke to the airline.<eos> They know you're a victim in all this.<eos> Your job's there if you want it.
Ah!<eos> - Stop there for a bit.<eos> That is different!<eos> OK... 'Over the past six or seven years' laboratories in the US, Canada and my laboratory in the UK have all demonstrated that this approach achieves many of the health benefits that people expect to get if they committed two or thee hours to working out in the gym,<eos> but most importantly, it's based on strong science.<eos> So how can such a short bit of exercise have any benefit at all?<eos> That's the magic question, really.<eos> The key thing about this exercise is it really breaks down the glycogen stores in the muscle and that's really how the glucose is stored.<eos> And that's the key signal from the muscle to the bloodstream saying, "I need to take up more."<eos> You're basically disturbing your homeostasis, you're shaking things up a bit, breaking down storage in the muscle and then the muscle suddenly thinks, "perhaps I do need more glucose," and sucks it out of the blood.
Was that true, or were you just hitting on me?<eos> Did you really play B26, or were you just hitting on me?<eos> Can we make this... our anniversaryinsteadof hers?<eos> Meet me tomorrow night at the Rosewood Grille.<eos> I will be the guy at the bar reading Ulysses.<eos> You still haven't finished that book?<eos> No one has.<eos> I'm just a hopeless romantic.<eos> I thought we could recreate the date.<eos> I wouldn't exactly call it a date.
He was one of the gang, I guess you'd say.<eos> A good friend.<eos> Funny.<eos> Rather annoying, though - he was good looking and played guitar and could paint, and always had nice girlfriends.<eos> No-one that you ever really would have imagined would wind up the way he did wind up.<eos> # Counting the leaves Which tremble at dawn<eos> # Ah, aaah, ah, aaah, ah # Ah, aaah, ah, aaah, ah<eos> # Heart of the sun<eos> # Heart of the sun. #<eos> In this post Dark Side Of The Moon period, we were all having to assess what we were in this business for, why we were doing it, whether we were artists or business people.
They just wanted bits of ad-hoc animation bunged into the show willy nilly. And, of course,<eos> I had my little team of animators who are strictly trained to work to a track, and without a track, they don't know what to do.<eos> And I used to go and tell Roger this, and he said, "It doesn't matter about a track, just let them do something."<eos> I assume he made all that spherical stuff having heard the VCS3 throbbing at the beginning of Welcome To The Machine.<eos> All of that stuff.<eos> When it came to Welcome To The Machine, I think Roger was really getting into his synthesisers.<eos> So, hence you have all these different effects.<eos> I mean, some of these noises are, to me, just futuristic.<eos> I loved that machine.<eos> I used it a lot back in the day.
You know, the abortion doctor, the one who croaked the other day.<eos> Now that you have your locket, you can relax.<eos> Schwarz!<eos> Open up!<eos> Ain't there some Jew holiday?<eos> Damn!<eos> So come on, now.<eos> Tell me, what do you need this Jew for?<eos> Molly gave me Ellen's locket.<eos> Look, if I had known she had it, I'd have told you first thing.

Uncle Marcus, I was born in America.<eos> America?<eos> There's no America.<eos> Thank you. Only blue and gray.<eos> And black.<eos> Liberia's got its own declaration of independence, its own constitution.<eos> I'm gonna create my own destiny.<eos> When my feet land on Liberia's shore, I will shout the new republic's motto.<eos> "The love of liberty has brought us here."<eos> Mary had a little lamb She kept it on a barge
She didn't break up with me.<eos> I shut it down.<eos> What did she tell you?<eos> That she taught you how to shoot a compound bow, for starters.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Like once or twice. That was her thing.<eos> I just did it 'cause she liked it.<eos> And I couldn't give a shit... sit down, son!<eos> Now... What'd you do with her bow, Rich?<eos> She said you kept it.
Bet I could do an ultrasound.<eos> I'm way behind today.<eos> I'll be quick.<eos> I'll even warm up the gel for you.<eos> Another time.<eos> Amelia... You really should do this.<eos> So I can see everything that is wrong with my baby... the horns sticking out of its head...<eos> Its long corkscrew tail?<eos> I know that you're freaked out, but part of it is because none of this is real for you yet.<eos> But as soon as you see it on the ultrasound and you hear the heartbeat, it's all gonna change for you. It's gonna be real.
Today's just an excuse to spend the night in a hotel room. I'm sorry.<eos> I was faking it just then.<eos> I think she can still hear you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> I'm still wearing edible underwear.<eos> - Well, if I'd known that...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> It's one big Jenga tower.<eos> You pull a piece out, put it on top, and the tower definitely gets higher, but also gets less stable.
And have sex with him.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah, you know, this year, I was thinking, I really want to do something special,<eos> You know, something that matters.<eos> James is about to come down.<eos> Don't treat him any differently, but don't look directly at him.<eos> Compliment his outfit, but not too much, or he'll know.<eos> They hate my hat.<eos> That hat was given to you by Mr. Jason Mraz.<eos> Let them hate it.
For what?<eos> For conducting the rite of blasphemy!<eos> And you wonder why people think you're a bit odd.<eos> I don't care what people think.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Good to see you again.<eos> It's been a while. Come on, you nut job.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> No, no, I'm staying here.<eos> I'm gonna perform the ritual, film it, stick it on the internet and prove the existence of evil.
What?<eos> You've been ignoring his messages.<eos> Uh, yes, but how do you know that?<eos> Well, when he couldn't reach you, he called my office.<eos> [ Sighing ] Oh. I'm sorry.<eos> Every time he calls, he wants money.<eos> I haven't spoken to the guy in years.<eos> I don't want to drag you into this.<eos> His address.<eos> He said you didn't have it.
Owen. What are you doing here?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You texted me.<eos> [ Chuckles ] I did not text you.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> [ Chuckling ] Uh, no, I didn't. Yeah, today.<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> Oh, I don't know. Um...<eos> That's weird.<eos> Did you leave it in the car or the office?
It's brilliant.<eos> Big, 500 horsepower, V10 upfront, naturally aspirated, it's just distilled essence of single-malt driving pleasure.<eos> And that gives BMW a problem much like that faced by the makers of Die Hard 4, or of Cheryl Cole's 2011 calendar.<eos> This is a personal analogy, but it works for me.<eos> The problem is this... where to go next?<eos> Well, this is where they've gone the next.<eos> It's the brand-new M5.<eos> It costs £73,000 and, on paper, it sounds like a much tamer beast.<eos> For starters, the magnificent V10 has been replaced by a more polar bear-friendly V8.<eos> When you're driving along, you can certainly hear it.
See, the motorway? The M...<eos> It's also more economical.<eos> It has a bigger fuel tank so it can go harder for longer, and then there's the ride.<eos> It's really, really good, comfortable.<eos> There's no stupid rock-hard run flat tyres.<eos> It feels better than a normal five series.<eos> The new M5, then, is not only better than the old one, I'd say that, as an all-rounder, it's actually the best car in the world right now.<eos> And, in some ways, it reminds me of this...<eos> The BMW M1.<eos> In 1984, BMW actually took the engine out of that and put it in a five series and the original M5 was born.
Loose canons like Martin, they represent that threat.<eos> So we need to neutralize him quietly.<eos> Okay?<eos> Whatever you say, boss.<eos> Hong Kong?<eos> Welcome to the Grand Mandarin Hotel.<eos> Do you have a reservation?<eos> Sestok, Mr. and Mrs.<eos> We're pleased to offer a bay-view suite for extended stay, and a gift basket arrived for you.<eos> We've placed it in your room.
Besides, this office practically runs itself.<eos> Bullshit, it does. Sir.<eos> What's with that A.P.D. thing?<eos> The electromagnets?<eos> They're thinking it's about Fring's laptop.<eos> A couple of days before it happened, desk sergeant gets a call from a "postal inspector" quote, unquote wanting to know where they keep the thing.<eos> And he told them?<eos> Anything left of the laptop?<eos> Do we look that lucky?<eos> I sneaked a peek before A.P.D. took it out of Fring's office.
The very next day, what's the one thing he does not do?<eos> He does not go buy another lottery ticket, right?<eos> He counts his lucky stars, and he sails off into the sunset which, seems to me, and all due respect some advice you two might take.<eos> What lottery did I win, exactly?<eos> Hey, you're alive.<eos> I mean, as far as I'm concerned, that's the Irish sweepstakes.<eos> I'm alive, and I'm broke.<eos> Counting the money that I owe Jesse, I'm about 40 grand in the hole.<eos> Does that seem like an acceptable stopping point to you?<eos> There is gold in the streets just waiting for someone to come and scoop it up.
You don't mean to get to them all today?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Hey, let's go!<eos> Back here.<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Are you moving back in?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll keep the condo for now.<eos> Selling it in this market, I'd get killed.
What about cell phones?<eos> - Crew could just call the cops.<eos> - No cellular either.<eos> I'm telling you, it's the perfect place.<eos> You'd have time enough to stop the train siphon off as much methylamine as you can carry... - ...get away before the police are called.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> Wait a minute. Assuming we can stop a moving train how do we know we have the right one? And which tanker car is which?<eos> I can't believe that they would advertise their contents.<eos> Once the train gets rebuilt in Flagstaff a final manifest gets uploaded to my company's server.<eos> I'll have it for you sometime between midnight and 2 a.m.
It's more money than I've ever seen.<eos> And when it comes down to it are we in the meth business? Or the money business?<eos> Relax, kid. There's no one there.<eos> You sure?<eos> I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.<eos> Glad to see you could make it out.<eos> I was surprised to get your call.<eos> Good surprise, I hope.<eos> There's one gallon, as discussed.<eos> You take that back home to your people, test it.
Straight back. Slow it down.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, Mrs. White.<eos> "Vamonos."<eos> I Wish.<eos> All right. Let's get this thing hooked up.<eos> Walt.<eos> What is this?<eos> Do you really wanna know?<eos> - Why are you hiding it here?
Hey, Mrs. White.<eos> "Vamonos."<eos> I Wish.<eos> All right. Let's get this thing hooked up.<eos> Walt.<eos> What is this?<eos> Do you really wanna know?<eos> - Why are you hiding it here?<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> Who are you hiding it from?
See you later.<eos> The way she looked past me you'd think she was still blind.<eos> I have a gift for you.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I never got a chance to give it to you because you blew me off. Oh.<eos> Well, that's nice, but I can't accept it.<eos> You can't accept a birthday gift?<eos> Well, considering we never went out, I don't think it would be right. I insist.<eos> Where can I find you tomorrow?<eos> I'll drop it off.
Well, then grab me some dirt.<eos> And stop staring at my ass.<eos> Right.<eos> So, 30 of these make a "local network,"<eos> for what exactly?<eos> A magnetometer array.<eos> It'll pinpoint any anomaly that occurs in the park to within a meter.<eos> I don't get it. Why did you apply for this job if you don't really know what it is?<eos> I didn't.<eos> Cross gave it to me.
- Am I being too loud again?<eos> - All right. Buckle up.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna go and try to do the laundry, and I'm gonna do it very quietly so I don't bother you.<eos> Maybe Manny can help me.<eos> Manny!<eos> - I get it.<eos> - Manny!<eos> I get it.<eos> Now you're not even making any noise.<eos> Okay, this is way too many grapes, and this spoon is modern day, so if we use it, everyone at the table has to react in shock at the spoon from the future.
I believe it is time I take you out on a romantic date.<eos> Aw, I don't know.<eos> Who has time to go out any more? Can't you just come over and ruin my sheets like you usually do?<eos> Oh, just say yes.<eos> I'll take you anywhere you want. Then take me to the Channing Family auction and buy me something gold.<eos> How is this romantic?<eos> How is this romantic?<eos> It's gold. Wait, is that the catalog from Caroline's estate auction?<eos> Yes.<eos> I found it in the trash out behind our building. Caroline threw it there 'cause she doesn't wanna see it again.

Yeah, that's an excellent point. Thank you.<eos> Neither is being boring.<eos> - No, you know what?<eos> You're right. Laugh it up.<eos> I'm the boring guy, right?<eos> Because I always side with the law. But let me tell you something.<eos> The law does not encumber artistic expression, it allows it.<eos> You can't paint, you can't write, you can't compose, you cannot jump off a bridge in a bird costume without freedom, and freedom cannot exist without the code of law.<eos> And that is a code that I will fight to defend until my dying breath.<eos> Because where people fail to respect it, civilization disappears.
Why not?<eos> See?<eos> And your parents probably had high hopes for you, too.<eos> He's been doing it all day.<eos> First it was funny, then it got sad, now it's back to being funny again.<eos> You never see a cat carrying on like this.<eos> They're dignified animals.<eos> Clean their butts with their tongues.<eos> He still grinding his balloon knot?<eos> Yeah, he's really rubbing it raw.
You were the first woman I'd been with besides my ex-- 35 years.<eos> I panicked.<eos> An-and it wasn't 'cause y-you weren't pretty naked or anything like that.<eos> I'd have run from Angie Dickinson.<eos> - Oh, lucky her.<eos> - Dottie--<eos> - Good-bye, Jay!<eos> - Dottie, Dottie, please. I'm just trying to get my ballot in the box.<eos> oh, yeah, that sounds familiar.<eos> Yeah, but you don't have to do anything. Just let me put it in!
When's breakfast?<eos> Do you want to help me look for it?<eos> No. I don't know what day of the week it is.<eos> Friday.<eos> Yeah, thank God.<eos> He's been no trouble.<eos> You been showing her your magic finger?<eos> I'd never have noticed.<eos> Is it rare?<eos> My mother had it.
Sorry.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What are you wearing?<eos> ! It's called the Gait Replicator.<eos> Yeah, he's going to recreate what happened at the murder site.<eos> We're linking up his Robo Cop suit into the Angelatron.<eos> And the Replicator can mimic exactly the height, bone structure and the weight distribution of the victim.<eos> When I walk on the pressure-sensitive, computerized mat, every step I take shows up on the grid on the Angelatron.<eos> We cross-reference it against the topographical map of what happened at the murder site.
Unfortunately, that is to be expected.<eos> Did my husband trust you, Mr Gently?<eos> With his life.<eos> Would you be prepared to continue your investigation?<eos> What was my husband paying you?<eos> Fi... six, seven, seven £700 per day, plus all reasonable expenses.<eos> Rest assured, Mrs Edwards, the web of interconnected events will undoubtedly lead us to your husband's killer.<eos> David was a very paranoid man.<eos> Wherever the software prototype is, he would have hidden it well.<eos> If you can find it, we might discover why he was murdered.
Let me guess. It means they're completely insane.<eos> You may well be right.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm going to get us a pizza.<eos> We're expecting a murderer to drop by any second.<eos> You're perfectly safe, MacDuff. No, I'm not.<eos> The bait has been set.<eos> I'm not going to stand here alone, in the trap, while you get a pizza!<eos> Whoever the killer is, won't kill us until they've got the software.<eos> As we haven't got it, they're never going to kill us.
On the level of human interaction, the strands of connectivity would be in their trillions.<eos> Indeed.<eos> So?<eos> So...<eos> Perhaps you can tell me about the security system?<eos> I can tell you that it's as hopeless as everything else around here.<eos> What is that?<eos> It injects a tiny microchip under the skin, allowing the carrier to interact and control the building.<eos> E- mail, heating and lighting. Security too.<eos> If we are to solve this case, we must become one with the technology that surrounds it.
What's "Baggage"?<eos> It's, like, my favorite show on Game Show Network.<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> Marnie and I don't have cable, so I haven't seen that.<eos> Shut up. No way.<eos> Get over here now.<eos> Okay, so, there are three contestants.<eos> Today they're girls.<eos> And this guy Danny is looking for love, and they each have three suitcases... a little one, a medium one, and a big one.<eos> And in them they have, like, their secret baggage and they reveal it. And if it's super freaky, he eliminates them.
I was afraid he'd get the swine flu.<eos> What...?<eos> He never saw Babe.<eos> Two out of three, Mr. Curly Tail.<eos> No...!<eos> Virginia.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Curly, newspaper.<eos> Burt, we don't get the newspaper.<eos> I know. He steals it from the neighbors.
But being a liberal-minded intellectual, I assume you won't need to do that anyway.<eos> Yeah.<eos> PHONE RINGS You might need to think about it.<eos> Hello? I spent 45 quid.<eos> Is that all right?<eos> Oh, that's brilliant.<eos> I got a dressing-gown for you, well, for her to give to you.<eos> It's just a white towel robe thing.<eos> Perfect, that's perfect.<eos> If you don't want it, I'll have it. No!
He keeps his victims for years.<eos> The burial sites would be someplace special, and he'd need a reason to revisit.<eos> Is there a favorite place your dad likes to go?<eos> You mean like the lake or something?<eos> No. Most likely having to do with his work.<eos> Somewhere he's proud of?<eos> His first development.<eos> Where is that?<eos> In Mesa.<eos> Every few years he adds on to it.
We suffered a loss, and you don't make major life decisions when you're reeling from a loss.<eos> I wanna buy some weed.<eos> Sorry, man, you got it wrong, but, uh, hey, if you want a paper, I'll be--<eos> I'm not a cop, okay?<eos> I know for a fact that you're a dealer.<eos> I've seen you here every single day.<eos> I know the drill.<eos> A guy comes up, he hands you a $100 bill, he walks away with a folded newspaper full of weed.<eos> Well, I have money.<eos> If you don't want it, I'll be happy to take it to the coffee cart down at 50th and Lex who we both know is your competition.
Auf wiedersehen.<eos> You look overwhelmed.<eos> Let me help.<eos> Forget that. You're gonna do this instead.<eos> Louis said I'm not allowed to prioritize your work anymore.<eos> You think I'm taking orders from Louis now?<eos> Consider things status quo.<eos> Yeah, well, they aren't.<eos> They are as far as you and I are concerned.<eos> I give you work, and you're gonna do it.
Because I told her I can't be me without you.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Well, I thought it.<eos> And she knows it.<eos> Okay, I will come back on two conditions.<eos> One is you replace that check with a bigger one.<eos> And the other?<eos> Harold...<eos> Is that porn?<eos> No. Well, yes, but that's not what I'm using it for.

Yep, all set.<eos> Main citations are tabbed.<eos> Good.<eos> Go.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> Okay, I was just, um... you know, before, um...you--<eos> Are you having a stroke?<eos> What?<eos> My bonus.<eos> Louis didn't have it.
Is that your mom and dad on there?<eos> Get out, Harvey, I'm Skyping.<eos> Is that Harvey Specter?<eos> Let me speak to him.<eos> It is about time I met your best friend...<eos> Was that your mom and dad?<eos> What's up?<eos> What's this?<eos> The address of my tailor.<eos> Donna said you asked for it.
He's making a pattern, he doesn't even realise he's doing it.<eos> If we can crack it, we'll be able to see what his next move will be.<eos> Just like knowing where the German army will be in three days' time.<eos> If we get ahead of him, we can stop him before he kills again.<eos> - How, exactly?<eos> - Well, just like we used to.<eos> Treat the killings like a code; keep at it till we break it.<eos> If Susan's right, perhaps we are the only people to find his pattern.<eos> I know you feel strongly about this girls, but... it's really not our place.<eos> And what if we do find it?

If you're offering.<eos> - If you insist.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> How was Mike?<eos> You know when you... when you have a Sunday and it's loaded up with hot fudge, and whipped cream, and ice cream, and a cherry on top?<eos> - Yeah. - He's the spoon.<eos> Hey, can't eat without a spoon.<eos> What's the latest with your union file?<eos> Um, I don't know.<eos> I'm ignoring it.
Any progress?<eos> No.<eos> Pretty much a sucking black hole of nothing. I found some supplies.<eos> Curry. That's great.<eos> That's great. And curry.<eos> Great.<eos> - You're frustrated.<eos> - Frustrated? Frustrated doesn't even scratch it.<eos> What is all of this crap, and what is this ugly-ass thing even for?<eos> Why did Ben even give it to me?
Anything you want... Food, women, anything...<eos> Just ask, okay?<eos> Sir...<eos> I apologize for the mess with Ben Matheson.<eos> I didn't mean for the man to die.<eos> Drop the formalities, Tom. We've been friends too long for that.<eos> I'm promoting you to major.<eos> How would you like to head up intelligence and interrogations?<eos> You've been angling for that job for years.<eos> Now it's yours, if you want it.
Hey, she makes 'em!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You and Jamie Lapidus?<eos> For how long?<eos> A few weeks.<eos> Started the night of our premiere.<eos> She gave me a handjob during the screening.<eos> A handjob? ! During our show?<eos> Relax.<eos> It's not like she was watching it.
- You're so present.<eos> - You have a lot of presence.<eos> Okay, how about this? What if I go on their little adventure with them?<eos> Well, that wouldn't quite make sense.<eos> Ôhe whole point is they're stealing your truck.<eos> Also, I'm not sure the Boys would want to go with you.<eos> Yeah, I could see that, except you're making them up.<eos> You can make them want to go with me.<eos> Look. Ôhe episode is working.<eos> I wish you were in it more, I really do, but I don't think that's a reason to start dismantling the whole thing.
Oh, no, I would never do that.<eos> And you know what I thought?<eos> I'm gonna sell my burial plot, and with the money, we can buy two cheaper ones together.<eos> Fran, you don't have to do that.<eos> - Peter!<eos> - But, yay.<eos> And look, I even found online already a place.<eos> It's not fancy, but we can afford it.<eos> Uh, that's because it's a pet cemetery.<eos> Oh, no wonder they call it "four feet under."
Is your car parked nearby?<eos> Yes, it's just out there. How did you know I had a car?<eos> The parking ticket, fell out of your purse when you dropped it.<eos> Can't have one without the other, can you?<eos> We're late, we need to get going. Err ...<eos> late for what?<eos> Actually, scratch the car.<eos> Manhattan Bridge is down to a single lane.<eos> We'll take the tube instead.<eos> Look at this place... yuck. I can't wait for you to tidy it.
Death threats have once again been leveled by the Mutants against soon-to-retire, 70-year-old commissioner James Gordon who had this to say in response:<eos> I've got one more month at this job, and I'd love to spend it nailing the Mutants.<eos> If they want to take me on, I'm delighted.<eos> Come and get me.<eos> Nearly coinciding with Gordon's retirement tonight also marks the 10th anniversary of the last sighting of the Batman.<eos> Most of our younger viewers new think of him as a myth many others still debate whether his one-man war on crime was right or wrong but this reporter hopes that wherever he is, he's enjoying a toast with good friends.<eos> To 10 years and my finally joining you.<eos> That was some stunt you pulled at the racetrack.<eos> Keeps the blood flowing.<eos> So long as most of it stays inside you.
I will carry it through the streets.<eos> And the Batman, who thinks he can mess with us.<eos> I will tear him limb from limb.<eos> Mutants.<eos> Surrender now or be destroyed.<eos> They don't even wait for an order.<eos> Kids today.<eos> No respect.<eos> Rubber bullets.<eos> All this metal, and you don't even use it to kill?
He killed my da.<eos> What more do you need?<eos> What do we need to wait for? Can we not get him?<eos> Of course we will Daniel.<eos> We're not going to let pushers and pimps and jumped up druggies like that little prick do this.<eos> But not yet, you hear me?<eos> All this nonsense in the paper is no good for us. We're not criminals.<eos> My ma wants the body back if we can get it.<eos> We'll do that.<eos> We'll get it out of him.
But then it-it dawned on me that I saw his birth certificate in with some of the TM shit, and I-I... I thought I would just take one more look, maybe get lucky.<eos> Hey, we can call the county.<eos> We can get copies.<eos> It's not the same as the original.<eos> Yeah?<eos> No, I know it.<eos> All right. I'll see you there.<eos> Problem?<eos> No.<eos> I hope you find it.
We used to come here to forget about the world.<eos> It's safe.<eos> Red John didn't kill her, Patrick.<eos> You'll never convince me that he did.<eos> I'd kill for a cup of tea right now.<eos> I can make you one.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> But we can't stay here.<eos> Why not?<eos> If Miranda bought this place, the police'll find it.
My daughter, she's friends with... with your son.<eos> Angel?<eos> Angel. He sounds like a great kid.<eos> Is he around?<eos> Angel just left for work a little while ago.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> No, there's no problem.<eos> Actually, uh, this is a little weird, but... She wrote a note for him, and she asked me to deliver it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Leave it with me.
- That's why I'm here.<eos> - Oh, Auggie--<eos> I have gone as far as I can on my own.<eos> I need access to that evidence to get the rest of the way.<eos> And unless I get it, you can expect my resignation.<eos> Because this is a time of extreme duress, I'm going to pretend you didn't just demand I violate a dozen protocols by passing you intel well above your clearance.<eos> But try this tack with me again and I assure you, you will not enjoy the consequences.<eos> Now if you'll excuse me, I have to call tech support.<eos> I'm having trouble accessing the evidence files on the Manhattan server.<eos> I'll have to recite my access code and under no circumstances can I have you overhear it. Do you understand what I'm saying?
Except me.<eos> I'm telling you, I was his secret weapon.<eos> In fact, the only place I ever met him was at his house.<eos> If you want to hit him, you got to hurry.<eos> I just wish... I just wish I could see that son of a bitch bleed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Give us his address. We'll go there.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> How do I know once I give it to you, you won't just kill me? L...
Have my men dump him into the ocean.<eos> Uh, okay, whoa.<eos> Whoa. You can't just dump him.<eos> I'm involved now.<eos> His body washes up on South Beach... there's gonna be an investigation, an autopsy.<eos> It won't take long before those drugs are traced back to me.<eos> What do I care?<eos> It's not my problem.<eos> Let me at least just take the body back to the hospital.<eos> We'll dump it in the incinerator.
That's an outrage!<eos> These guys are blasting us in the ass.<eos> Yeah, I mean, we pay their salaries, and they turn around and ass-blast us?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You don't pay taxes.<eos> You don't even vote.<eos> Who am I supposed to vote for, the Republican who's blasting me in the ass or the Democrat who's blasting me in the ass?<eos> Yeah, politics is all one big ass-blast.<eos> This doesn't all sound familiar to you guys?<eos> If these jerks don't want to do their job, I say we do it for 'em.
Jake!<eos> Jake... slow down<eos> Jake.<eos> That's the last apartment, 65.<eos> There is no 95, sweetheart.<eos> We're going to have to look somewhere else, okay?<eos> Hey...<eos> Come on, kids, I told you, no more playing soccer in the hallway...<eos> You following me?<eos> Jake's kite got away from us, and we were looking for it. And he just walked into this building.
Nice seeing you too.<eos> I didn't order this.<eos> - I said vodka tonic.<eos> - You said strawberry daiquiri.<eos> Well, it's fine. I don't mind.<eos> You're too lazy to fix your own mistake.<eos> What did you just say?<eos> Jeez, you're the same as you were in high school.<eos> - All uppity- ,Uppity?<eos> Listen, you white-trash fuck-twat, we're not in high school anymore. If you let any more of that racist bullshit fall out of your mouth I'm gonna rip open your heart and fry it up with some grits and collard greens.
Could never say for sure.<eos> Kids are always full of bumps and scratches.<eos> He's an expert at this.<eos> I don't know how I'll ever expose him without any physical evidence.<eos> One of the children told me he keeps a ledger.<eos> He used to write down all the punishments. He used to terrify them with it.<eos> Why didn't you tell the authorities about it? I did.<eos> You've seen what they're like.<eos> But maybe if it came from someone who worked there.<eos> If you could find it.
Enough moping. Mm.<eos> It's done.<eos> My advice would be to move on.<eos> Well, if it were only that easy.<eos> Except it is.<eos> Personal security is dangerous.<eos> Your nephew already lost his father.<eos> He can't lose his uncle, too.<eos> Does it ever bother you they never caught the guy who killed Andy?<eos> You know, when I was in Afghanistan, I had a job, and I did it.
Octyl cyanoacrylate.<eos> Gesundheit.<eos> No, it's what Nick smelled in the alley.<eos> We found traces of it on the murder weapon.<eos> What is it exactly?<eos> It's a kind of liquid bandage called Invi-Skin.<eos> You put it on an open wound like a new layer of skin.<eos> It smells bad, but it works, and the best part is, we found it on a part of the cinder block that was not covered in blood.<eos> So it could be a transfer from the killer's hand.<eos> Athletes use it to stop the bleeding-- otherwise they'll get pulled out of the game-- but primarily it's used by tradesmen who work with their hands.
All right, but, Nick, you can't talk to him and I'll have to notify his attorney.<eos> Fine.<eos> Set it up.<eos> Long time.<eos> I'm gonna need to take some reference samples from you.<eos> If I don't give 'em up... are you gonna hit me?<eos> Open up.<eos> I'm gonna need to take some pictures, too.<eos> Red isn't my best color.<eos> But then again, I won't be wearing it much longer.
That's intense.<eos> I thought this was just a bunch of gearheads having fun not...<eos> Death Race 2012.<eos> Let's circle out.<eos> Maybe we can reconstruct the crash.<eos> You found a piece of the fancy fuel tank, too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Even better...<eos> I think this possibly caused the explosion.<eos> A suspension link arrow to the heart of it.
Who was that?<eos> Wrong number.<eos> So now that we're engaged, whose apartment are we going to move into, and whose apartment are we going to get rid of?<eos> P.S.... It's yours, Ali.<eos> Okay.<eos> We are not engaged.<eos> We are engaged.<eos> Do we understand that?<eos> We do not.<eos> We have been waiting to plan Joe's wedding for our entire life, and we are not going to let you ruin it with a barefoot-on-the-beach theme.
I don't know.<eos> I would love to have my father back.<eos> But there are things that... there are things we shouldn't wish for.<eos> People wish for all kinds of things, Maria.<eos> But, to change, to remake the world? No!<eos> That'd be too much.<eos> A... breaking of the world.<eos> You understand, no matter what you choose to get, you will be breaking the world.<eos> That's what we do.<eos> We take the world and we crack it.
Look, Kitty, you know I can't keep you in the loop.<eos> Has there been a replacement?<eos> For the moment, some new kid from Driscoll's office, uh, to help with the transition.<eos> Ian Todd.<eos> Can I ask a question?<eos> Were you fired or did you quit?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Both, I think.<eos> Aw, fuck this thing.<eos> Give it to me on paper, so I can mark it up with this thing.
Well, I thought about it.<eos> You explained why you ran me off the bridge, so least I could do is explain how I feel.<eos> The truth is, Rebekah, I think you're amazing.<eos> You've had a thousand years to learn, to grow, and to start fresh...<eos> And somehow you've managed to throw it all away.<eos> Now you're alone.<eos> You're compelling your friends.<eos> Your brother hates you.<eos> You whine about not finding love.<eos> The reason you don't find love is because you don't deserve it.
Good for you.<eos> No forced entry.<eos> Windows were locked.<eos> Whoever did this got in easy, maybe boyfriend easy.<eos> The door downstairs is ridiculously heavy.<eos> It keeps closing on 'em.<eos> So this maybe boyfriend...<eos> his name on the lease?<eos> Yeah, the name on the lease is, uh, a Homer Simpson.<eos> Yeah, well, we're running it through the system.
But I know someone who is.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Happy!<eos> Hello again.<eos> How you doing?<eos> You still working on this thing?<eos> Careful with that.<eos> Looks good!<eos> Albatross D-3, right?<eos> The "V-strutter" is what they used to call it.
I'm married.<eos> Now why would I be shagging her?<eos> As your dad says, as long as you don't bring them home.<eos> You use carbolic to get rid of the smell of the fish, don't you?<eos> Who's telling you all this rubbish, eh?<eos> Do you or don't you?<eos> So?<eos> Traces of the same soap were found on Dolores.<eos> On her neck.<eos> Well, maybe she used it as well.
Good.<eos> It seems we've hit a rough patch.<eos> And actually, you and Riley have hit a rough patch, too.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm sure it's nothing we all can't survive.<eos> As long as we do it together.<eos> With all respect, Georgia, I know this might've felt like family at one time, you know, before there were so many of us, but now we're not a family looking out for one another.<eos> Times are tough.<eos> Now we're just a bunch of business girls looking out for ourselves, okay?<eos> They may not admit it, and you may not, either, but doesn't mean that's not the way it is.<eos> Well, this place will be whatever we make it, right?
"Why did you come?"<eos> And I quoted him... from the film Sarabana'...<eos> I answered...<eos> "Because you called for me."<eos> And then I left, and I'm happy I was here... because that same night... at some time that night - we don't really know when - he continued his voyage.<eos> But now in the universe somewhere, you know?<eos> And actually, I think he's been here a lot... because the light has changed... the wind comes when you want it... the sun comes when we want it... and even rain.<eos> And I think when I'm saying too-silly things... he let all the little flies come... and kind of ruin the picture for you.<eos> Many, many years ago... I wrote him a little note.<eos> And today I - I found out he had kept it in his teddy bear.
I mean, they hit me in the balls with a bat, but nothing else.<eos> They call you any names?<eos> Yeah, um, fag, homo- look, I don't know why.<eos> I'm-I'm telling you, I'm not gay, all right?<eos> All right.<eos> Did you get a look at these guys?<eos> Yeah, um, dark hair, Puerto Ricans maybe.<eos> What about the van?<eos> - What color was it? - I don't know.<eos> I didn't see it.
There's a baby on its way!<eos> A baby!<eos> Great news, my friend.<eos> You've a brother or sister on the way!<eos> There's a baby on its way!<eos> A baby!<eos> Really, Münire?<eos> Yes, really.<eos> Why?<eos> Didn't you expect it of us?
What's going on?<eos> The guy has made himself popular!<eos> It's madness to bulldoze him in public and make enemies at election time.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> Just wait.<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Mustafa, I had a file here. It had my writing in it.<eos> I put it in the drawer just before the police came in.<eos> Oh, Lord...<eos> When the police descended I didn't want them finding it.
All right.<eos> OK.<eos> Look, I've grown up now.<eos> No one can mess with me. C'mon!<eos> Got any other excuses, Süleyman the Wrestler's grandson? Huh?<eos> OK!<eos> I want to write for Green Hanyeri.<eos> Bravo, Ali!<eos> Dad was back to his old excited self and suddenly 15 years younger.<eos> He dashed off his first column and turned it in.
Well, she is now.<eos> Brooke Hudson is in the wind.<eos> I'll get out a BOLO.<eos> Cassandra was killed 12 hours ago.<eos> Brooke could be anywhere by now.<eos> Well, what about her family?<eos> They're out of state -- they haven't been notified yet since Brooke is the closest next of kin.<eos> So, now they need a notification and a squad car outside their door in case Brooke shows up.<eos> Yeah, uh, let's have Daniel pull Brooke's driver's license photo.<eos> That's a good idea -- get her face on a flier, pass it around the neighborhood.
Real hospitals are generally pretty busy being... Uh, being hospitals. (Laughs) Right.<eos> Of course.<eos> Are those fake too? No.<eos> No, those are real.<eos> What are they for?<eos> Um... just... even me out. Right.<eos> You know, I used to take those too.<eos> They made me feel better but they didn't make me get better.<eos> They work for me. Do they?<eos> I mean I'm sure they mask the problem so you don't have to deal with it, but...
Yeah, if you see the butterfly tattoo... you're dead...<eos> I know him, that Chinese fence bastard.<eos> - The notorious one.<eos> - He sure is.<eos> He's into arms dealing now.<eos> Wait, how much will you sell it for?<eos> US$20 million.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> $20 million!<eos> - Who will you sell it to?
So, you and the pre-cog, huh?<eos> Didn't see that one coming.<eos> Do you guys get it?<eos> It's funny because she's a psychic.<eos> That's why it's funny.<eos> We need your help.<eos> Listen to this riddle.<eos> There were four brothers--<eos> I'm a pre-cog, not a riddle master.<eos> Why don't you solve it yourself?
The second crime, the robbery, was committed by a man.<eos> A very strong man judging by the items he removed from the apartment.<eos> How strong does a guy have to be to steal a wallet and a watch?<eos> You're forgetting the armoire.<eos> Dust patterns on the wall and the floor tell us it stood here, as do these scratches on the floor.<eos> You're nuts.<eos> Actually, he's not.<eos> It was a very heavy piece of furniture, that.<eos> And this building has no elevator.<eos> Are we to suppose that the thief got it down six flights of stairs before the police arrived?
You blink excessively. Your eyes dart.<eos> You also lost a great deal of weight over the last few months, even though your diet's as revolting as ever.<eos> And the fact that your carotid has started jumping up and down like a basketball makes me think that your stash is nearby.<eos> It's in your desk, perhaps?<eos> Tell us what we need to know right now, and I won't start throwing your drawers open in front of Captain Gregson and Detective Bell.<eos> Also, um... when you're ready to get your life back on track... Hemdale Rehabilitation Facility gets my very strongest recommendation.<eos> Uh, they even have a pool.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, Tommy, uh... since you and I go back a ways,<eos> I'm gonna take this file and put it on my desk.
Well ..<eos> I've been here for quite long<eos> What were you doing roaming around the Ward Office<eos> I wanted to hear what people think about the personal file system<eos> I wanted to help for your project<eos> It seems the angle of elderly and young people are irreconcilable<eos> Applying so much effort for so little result<eos> I understand it's wasted effort, still ... I wish I could do something for you<eos> Only you had it right<eos> This project is not about what we can offer But about who's gonna use it
She was stabbed with a dagger ... just like in the game.<eos> Who the hell is Undirmaor?<eos> Because that's our killer.<eos> Tell me you have something 'cause we don't have a single witness.,<eos> Well, I found a hair on Kendra's cloak.<eos> No root ball.<eos> But we are trying a new forensic laser technique.<eos> It uses ultraviolet light and mass spectrometry.<eos> - Faster, please.<eos> - Zaps the hair and turns it into a gas.
- Finally, huh?<eos> Some kind of preliminary thing this week.<eos> That's good.<eos> - Larry.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Something happened at the bar Lundi Gras night.<eos> There was this kid at the bar. I'd never seen him before.<eos> Did he say anything?<eos> Just gave me that look, you know?<eos> Then he lit a match. He held it.
No remains. L.P.:<eos> Well, I'm trying to establish a time line, an exact date for when your officer found Mr. Tanner's vehicle.<eos> Well, you know where we found the car.<eos> A stone's throw.<eos> The fourth district just around the corner.<eos> You see what I'm saying?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> You've intimated law enforcement might be involved.<eos> According to Tanner, they were.<eos> An N.O.P.D. officer commandeered his vehicle, then drove off with it with Mr. Glover still in the backseat.
- Have you forgotten?<eos> Our technology can improve drastically the life of people<eos> Let's see the fields next<eos> I'm not sure we have that much time<eos> She's coming Let's go to the field<eos> Wait<eos> We have almost no response<eos> - What's the connection rate?<eos> - About 5% of the total households<eos> No one is using it
But as long as it doesn't affect work... what's that, celestia?<eos> All right.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Mr. Donaghy, hi.<eos> I'm Stewart Der.<eos> I'm the chief engineer here at Kouchtown.<eos> Do you know the history of this building, Stewart?<eos> During World War II, the Bazooka Joe corporation used a softer version of their gum to make armor-piercing bullets... Here.<eos> Years later, the government took it over.<eos> They turned it into a training facility for single mothers to teach illegal immigrants how to fill out unemployment forms.
All they teach us now is how to build rollercoasters and survivor challenges.<eos> This is what we've been making for the past month? We have 10,000 of these?<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> I'm not a math guy, really.<eos> This is only a setback.<eos> I just have to create a market for terrible couches.<eos> Besides, what did Theodore "Bazooka" Joe do when his eccentric millionaire father left him nothing but a tiny pink rock quarry?<eos> He baked those rocks and sold them to children. As gum.<eos> Tracy, I need your input.<eos> I cannot give it to you. I'm a married man.
Let's go.<eos> Blackjack, it's taking almost...<eos> Sheriff... what's all this?<eos> Your boy here got lost.<eos> Wound up in my jail.<eos> But, in the spirit of cooperation, we're gonna drop the charges.<eos> Well, I appreciate the favor.<eos> It's not a favor.<eos> Jail's full.<eos> Well, I'm still gonna take it as a favor.
Guidebooks.<eos> No, they're not for me.<eos> Predictable and safe.<eos> Safe doesn't interest me.<eos> When I was a boy, my father left us-- died, actually.<eos> My mother packed me up and took me on a world tour.<eos> - For how long? - Years.<eos> We spent at least a month at every place, sometimes six.<eos> My mother homeschooled me on the road.<eos> What better education than learning about the world while seeing it?
Eat, my son.<eos> Hello, Ziad, my love.<eos> They fired on the settlement.<eos> Maybe you saw it on TV.<eos> Two wounded.<eos> Everyone's here, even the visitor.<eos> Hello, Ziad.<eos> It's Chloe', Mike's doctor.<eos> The other day, she let me listen to his heart.<eos> Can you hear it, my love?
Not king, no.<eos> It is God.<eos> You give your life to it.<eos> Say it.<eos> The booze is God.<eos> My wife knows what a vile piece of scum I am.<eos> I can't bear it!<eos> I can't bear being me.<eos> I say you can bear it.<eos> I say you are bearing it right now.
I promise.<eos> The man trying to destroy me, I have to find him, finish this.<eos> So we can start again.<eos> I was convinced I could live with my conscience if I was doing some good.<eos> Never possible.<eos> There's only one way to pay now.<eos> We have Pulis's phone.<eos> That's the way to get you out of this.<eos> No, I won't do that.<eos> You take it to a lawyer, someone untouchable, tell him you found it in the house.
I heard myself use the poisonous phrase "political reality".<eos> Well, there's only one political reality that matters now... what's best for this city.<eos> Daniel, shouldn't Jerry be here? I mean...<eos> Jerry's not the mayor.<eos> I've had some papers drawn up.<eos> As of now, as of this minute... it's done.<eos> This is an exclusive 20-year contract which states that all city services will be governed, run and owned by the people who do the work.<eos> There's a stipulation in here which makes it impossible for this contract to be sold on.<eos> The people of this city gave me the power.<eos> Now I'm giving it away.
- I know.<eos> They big-time now.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I get a suite?<eos> - Comes with the gig.<eos> You should see the rooms they give the Nevilles.<eos> So this event is for politicians?<eos> Mystick Krewe of Louisianans.<eos> State does it every year right before the real Mardi Gras to show off here in D.C.
Just to see what it's like, try it out.<eos> My sister's a fucking fatty.<eos> My parents are dead.<eos> So, I've got nothing.<eos> Okay, so where have you always wanted to look that you've never looked before?<eos> I've never thought about it.<eos> Marnie's not very secretive, so...<eos> Well, we know where she keeps her vagina massager. Um...<eos> - You mean vibrator? - (\/IBRATOR BUZZING)<eos> Because that's what I call it.
- Come out right now.<eos> - No!<eos> - Do you like the movie?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We could, like, watch something else if you're not into it.<eos> I have, like, other movies. I have, like, five things from Netflix.<eos> I have, like, an animated one, and a few Jen Aniston ones.<eos> I have, like, an original James Bond with Pierce Brosnan if you're into that, or something else.<eos> No, it's not the movies, it's just my knee.<eos> It just, like, really starts to ache if I can't stretch it out.
Yes, actually.<eos> You do, why?<eos> Why do you think that?<eos> Because there's a woman standing less than 10 feet from you and all you can do is play with your own cock.<eos> - Is it bad?<eos> - It's really bad.<eos> It's pathetic and bad and disgusting and weird and lazy.<eos> Plus if you have a big cock, you should use it on a woman.<eos> - It's not that big. - It's not?<eos> No, maybe that's why you don't want me to touch it.
We have a new lead on a suspect. Is it the man in the picture?<eos> Elaine, it's very important that you understand this is only a lead.<eos> We will do anything we can to help, anything.<eos> There's something that you've already done. That's why I'm here.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I looked up that case you were talking about--<eos> Alexandra Udinov.<eos> Did you know that she carried her father's watch around with her?<eos> I think I remember reading that.<eos> Evidently, she looked at it every day as a reminder of who she really was.
Huh?<eos> oh, no!<eos> Aaahh!<eos> Get it off!<eos> Ha ha ha!<eos> Hey, soos, get in here!<eos> I wanna take pictures of this!<eos> You may have won the battle,<eos> But mark my words, Stanford,<eos> Your family has a weak spot, and I'm gonna to find it.
No problem.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> That's her.<eos> Let's go.<eos> And now for the geiger counter.<eos> Okay, guys, so, here's the thing. All wine bottles after 1947 have trace amounts of radioactivity.<eos> Cesium isotopes from atmospheric nuclear testing.<eos> Where did you get radioactive cesium?<eos> The things I do for Nate.<eos> Wait... so if it's radioactive, then why are we drinking it?
It's insanity. Every time Kristina adds something to their calendar, his phone starts dinging.<eos> So all day long at work it's just ding, ding, ding, ding, as she adds "hair appointment," "Max," "this and that,".<eos> "I'm gonna burp," wa-wa-wa-wa.<eos> I mean, whoo. Well, why do you care?<eos> Maybe it works for them.<eos> Wouldn't that drive you crazy if every time I added something to our schedule your phone started vibrating and making noise?<eos> Oh, well, I wouldn't know, because we've never had one. Mmhmm.<eos> That's right. And we should never have one.<eos> I'm telling you, the second you start planning every little detail of your life weeks in advance... they schedule sex.<eos> They call it "Funkytown."
Well, if you want something, spit it out, 'cause I've got to finish this, 'cause I've got to get out of here early today.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Okay, uh, well, I was, you know, I was just walking down the hallway, and I was thinking, you know, we're doing pretty good.<eos> Yeah, we're doing all right.<eos> I mean, we've only been at it for a year, and we already have a few employees.<eos> We got a little extra cheddar in the bank account.<eos> Yeah, a little.<eos> - Nice little nest egg.<eos> - I wouldn't call it a nest egg.
- But we have...<eos> - Your mom's got great doctors, and her prognosis looks really good.<eos> Yeah, we found the best doctors. We don't want you to worry.<eos> We just wanted you to know.<eos> You don't want me to worry, but you have breast cancer? Like, it's early.<eos> This happens all the time.<eos> Very early. Like, they caught it early?<eos> Yes.<eos> Happens all the time to so many women, okay?<eos> You know, they're gonna go in and take it out, and so many women survive from this, and I'm gonna be one of those women.
That's what you'd give a little kid... no, it's not.<eos> This is the family dog.<eos> I want a man-sized favor.<eos> I wanna do something substantial for you guys.<eos> I don't have any...<eos> everything's covered. Okay, I will take the dog to the dog park, but I wanna do at least one thing that Kristina will remember.<eos> - I don't have anything. - Ooh!<eos> I overheard you telling Amber that you're gonna order her favorite takeout on the day of the surgery.<eos> Do you want me to do that?<eos> I'll order from there, and then I'll pick it up and bring it...
How'd you get into this office?<eos> Oh, hey. I'm Lamont.<eos> I'm from San Fran-cheesy.<eos> Anywho, I was talking to my friend Travon who was saying that if you were ever in Alaska, you should stop by a chemical plant and check out the truck-driver logs.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I heard something about that.<eos> Sorry to bother you.<eos> Enjoy your evening.<eos> This salmon is delicious.<eos> I've been eating it all day, and I'm not even sick of it.
What can I do you for?<eos> Do you know an Alison Bailey?<eos> Nope.<eos> The bells do not ring.<eos> Are they ringing now?<eos> Did you move this piano?<eos> I move a lot of pianos.<eos> Yo,Clapton,we have proof that you moved this piano in your truck.<eos> Dude,look...<eos> I was supposed to deliver it to L.A. for repairs.
I'm cleaning.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well,as much as it pains me to admit,I was wrong about the glue that he found in the piano.<eos> I think our killer used it to clean a record.<eos> Wouldn't that mess the record up?<eos> Not if you follow this simple recipe:<eos> You take one LP album,add four ounces of store-bought hide glue.<eos> Spread evenly across the vinyl.<eos> In time,dust and particles affix to the glue.<eos> After the glue dries,you take a handy box cutter,and use it to pry the glue off of the record. And... voil? a perfectly clean record.
- What are you doing?<eos> I'll be back here at 6:00 tomorrow.<eos> If you don't have my money by then, you won't just be dealing with me.<eos> Uh, who's Cortez? My boss.<eos> Everything in this town is run by Cortez.<eos> He's a lot less understanding than I am.<eos> Well, that's weird, because you're not very understanding.<eos> What's the girl with the dragon tattoo gonna do to us?<eos> I'll tell you what she's gonna do to us.<eos> She's gonna cut off my dick and feed it to me.
Was she a patient there?<eos> Oh, most definitely.<eos> And some say that she set that fire.<eos> Garcia, can you get her medical records?<eos> Yeah, I tried to do that, but it turns out the new director of St. Baldwin's was a technophobe hyper-luddite like our Dr. Reid, and he only wanted the psych records to be on paper to protect confidentiality.<eos> Detective, we need you to get a copy of those records.<eos> You got it.<eos> What is this?<eos> Your prom.<eos> I didn't want you to miss it.
Seven hours Faith's been missing. Sniffer dogs, nothing.<eos> Door to door, nothing.<eos> We are failing this little girl.<eos> Sir, Stephen Groves called.<eos> Asked if you can go over. He say why?<eos> No.<eos> Did you ask?<eos> You are allowed to do your job, you know.<eos> I am doing my job.<eos> Why don't you just, once in a while, do it a little bit better?
I'd love to hear more, but I've got a night shift.<eos> Bye, Axl.<eos> Nailed by a goddess, no less.<eos> Man, we didn't just do the book of Kama Sutra; we tore out the pages and totally rewrote it!<eos> What's that smell?<eos> That'll be the pheromones, bro.<eos> I thought BO was a bad thing, but Stace was totally gagging for it.<eos> No, it smells like butter.<eos> Oh, we ran out of lubricant. But it's OK.<eos> I put it back in the fridge so it won't go rancid.
Let us bow our heads.<eos> And pray.<eos> Let us pray.<eos> Glory to God.<eos> Martin, take over.<eos> Charlie's got the jingle jangles.<eos> But I've never bell-rung before.<eos> I said, take over.<eos> I'm so ashamed...<eos> He took the cup, gave it to his disciples and said,
Let's stick with jackal.<eos> But first, you've got to leave your mark on this place.<eos> You've got to let future generations know that Marty Moone walked these halls.<eos> Oh, I'm going to blow this place wide open.<eos> This week, I'm Martin Mayhem.<eos> What?<eos> I thought you were Martin Martin.<eos> Last week, Horse.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> I wrote Mr Jackson a card and I'd like everyone to sign it.
Here, help me set it up.<eos> Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> There it is.<eos> - Now hop up.<eos> - All right.<eos> - How do you want me?<eos> Okay.<eos> Now the first step to relaxing is to just, you know, clear your head and maybe keep an open mind.<eos> Can do.<eos> The thing about pain is its true source is never where you feel it. - No?
It's weird.<eos> You have an older face.<eos> But, like, you don't have your shit together.<eos> Nessa can't come from sex.<eos> Only 69.<eos> That's a crazy helmet.<eos> Got to. Motorcycle law.<eos> Can you leave that rent check?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> I'll just put it on your desk.
You never told me that.<eos> I was there when Serge Gainsbourg died. - It was a crazy time.<eos> - Weren't you, like, eight?<eos> - Yeah, it was the end of Euro-disco.<eos> - I have so much to do.<eos> I think I'll probably read Proust... because sometimes it's good to do what you're supposed to when you're supposed to.<eos> Proust is pretty heavy.<eos> It's worth it, I hear.<eos> I meant the book - carrying it on the plane.<eos> I should probably learn French first... and then read it in French.
If Adam's still alive, maybe some of the other victims are, too.<eos> Adam was special-- his first.<eos> The Balloon Man's second and third victims are two of only three to be recovered.<eos> Their condition suggests that he rather liked the killing.<eos> After he had a taste, I don't believe he ever looked back.<eos> Question now is, what role did Adam play in their deaths? You think Adam helped him?<eos> he sympathized with his captor.<eos> Question is, to what degree?<eos> We did find him in that van.<eos> CSU is processing it for evidence to try and prove whether Mariana Castillo was inside.
It's more conical.<eos> It'd be a better key for the code, right?<eos> Harder to duplicate.<eos> Hold this.<eos> Whoa, this is the code?<eos> Cool!<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> Turner's stomach.<eos> I think it's a coded message called scytale.<eos> The Spartans used it to send secret messages during battle.
All right.<eos> Chaucer, let's go.<eos> Good boy.<eos> And listen, if you're going to walk next to me, no prancing.<eos> I don't want the Dobermans laughing at us.<eos> Guys, Turner encoded the code.<eos> It's a simple cipher.<eos> Of course.<eos> It's the old secret spy ring, from when we were kids.<eos> Come on, the spy ring, when we were kids-- you turn it and the letters line up?
I don't think I've ever seen him this excited.<eos> It's a cool ring.<eos> I know what I'm getting you for Christmas.<eos> All it is, is substituting one letter for another.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Letters on the top of the alphabet, letters on the bottom, are the key.<eos> Both the receiver and the sender need the key.<eos> So the A's become R's.<eos> Right.<eos> But Turner took the encrypted message, used the new key, and encoded it again.
I've saved a lot of souls in this world.<eos> But there's one that has been brought to us that we cannot forget, for it is he who will save us.<eos> I asked him where he was last Friday night. He said he sought shelter under a bridge.<eos> I asked him if he saw anyone there. He said no. I don't understand.<eos> Sometime tomorrow, this man will come into my office, and he will threaten me.<eos> And I will be forced to kill him... In self-defense.<eos> And when the police find Norman's laptop with his belongings, there will be no more questions about who killed Mr. Brewster.<eos> I understand why you felt like you had no choice but to kill Frank. And then Norman.<eos> But we can make another choice now.<eos> We can leave during tomorrow's fundraiser, you will take Norman's laptop and put it with Monroe's belongings.
You put out a little feeler, you see what comes back.<eos> Just don't push it, and you'll be fine.<eos> Okay?<eos> You ask me to approach Roya.<eos> I say it's a bad idea. Then you do this.<eos> For what?<eos> What is this? Sex?<eos> Understanding?<eos> If that doesn't work, then what?<eos> You remind me of the deal that we made... how much it hurts, your even bringing it up... how my entire family will be destroyed... if you're forced to tell them the truth?
You deal with this all the time.<eos> I mean, just another patient, right?<eos> My fiance's in a coma.<eos> What?<eos> He was in an accident.<eos> Oh, my. I'm sorry.<eos> I feel terrible.<eos> Yesterday he moved his hand, against the odds and the stats, against what everybody else is saying is gonna happen.<eos> But he's getting better.<eos> Anyway, my whole point is the human body is an amazing thing, Mr. Munk, and we will find out what's wrong with you and then we'll fix it, okay?
So you think an invisible Jordan is just... Hanging around the store? Why would he do that?<eos> And now I see why.<eos> There's a ghost in there!<eos> Who ya gonna call?<eos> Okay, so the next-door neighbor said she heard a really loud crash about an hour ago. But thought it was the meth lab downstairs.<eos> Nice neighborhood.<eos> Pete, just check out these burns. I mean, they kind of look like lightning strikes.<eos> All right. So something that controls lightning? Did Thor smoke a pipe?<eos> So where would a small-time thief go if he suddenly stumbled upon a powerful artifact?<eos> For starters, I'd use it to get an apartment with a roof.
BJ.<eos> Bobby Jones.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> These are the clubs Bobby Jones used in the 1921 British Open.<eos> His temper got the better of him, he stormed off the course, but not before throwing these clubs all over the green.<eos> Oh, well, we better keep them away from John McEnroe's tennis racket.<eos> Yeah, but why are they just lying here?<eos> Sand wedge.<eos> Uh, the 9 iron's missing.<eos> I think Conway's probably got it.
What did I do now? Where were you last weekend?<eos> Stuck at North Jersey State Prison, pulling a graveyard shift in the hospital wing.<eos> You can check with my son-of-a-bitch supervisor.<eos> Okay, we will.<eos> Tell us what you know about Colin Barnes.<eos> The bastard who ruined my career?<eos> Sanctimonious prick.<eos> There's that intention tremor that he noticed.<eos> Look, I was on Haldol. I had it under control.<eos> Yeah, but he found out about it at your birthday party.
She doesn't understand me because I'm not ripping off my bodice.<eos> I'm a romance novelist... well, a part-time romance novelist.<eos> I just write when I can, and I leave myself time to rest and replenish.<eos> I won't get my characters out of bed without good reason.<eos> Anything I may have read?<eos> Well, my biggest hit was my first one... The Other Side Of Ecstasy.<eos> It's exactly what it sounds like.<eos> Hold on. You're Jackie Van Ark?<eos> - Uh-huh. - I love that book!<eos> That's... we used to read it out loud - at summer camp after lights out.
Where did this thing come from? - Uh.<eos> Space.<eos> - Cute. It was actually because of you Avengers that we found out about the Skrull in the first place.<eos> Hawkeye decided to go after the Black Widow against orders.<eos> He tracked her to Hydra Island.<eos> He didn't know she was working undercover for me at the time.<eos> But while the Avengers were messing up months of work<eos> Mockingbird took down Madame Viper.<eos> When Viper hit the ground, I was going to go back to help your team.<eos> But then I saw it.
Dude, you have a gun.<eos> I can't shoot everybody.<eos> Plus, I used pepper spray on this kid the other day, turns out he was a skalengeck. Had no effect.<eos> Skalengeck.<eos> He probably enjoyed it.<eos> Yeah, this definitely would've done the trick, but how are you gonna explain all this stuff to Hank?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Check it out.<eos> The first bolt is meant to slow the attacker down.<eos> You fill it with hellebore extract.
You're a tough kid, Ryan.<eos> Or at least you think you are.<eos> Where did you get those injuries?<eos> If you carry on like this, the place you're going has 16-year-olds, 17-year-olds, and they're built like brick sheds.<eos> How d'you think you'll fare against one of those lads?<eos> They knock your teeth out, Ryan.<eos> They do that so you give a better blow job.<eos> I don't think that's very helpful, DC Fleming.<eos> It AIN'T my phone!<eos> But you recognise it, don't you?
But when the scientists weren't watching, then the electrons behaved like waves.<eos> They formed a pattern that looked like the interference pattern produced by waves on a screen.<eos> What you see depends on whether you're watching or not.<eos> If you're watching, you see the particle-like behavior like baseballs.<eos> If you're not watching, you see a wavelike behavior.<eos> But not both at the same time.<eos> Narrator: This was nothing less than astounding.<eos> Observation seems to change the nature of subatomic particles.<eos> Mysteriously, when we're not looking, things are waves. When we are looking, they look like particles.<eos> So even an electron, which seems to us like a particle, has wavelike properties when we're not looking at it.
one of dust and the other of gas.<eos> - There will be a tail growing and growing and growing, and you would eventually become engulfed in just a really rocky, icy, particle-filled environment.<eos> It would be very difficult on your spacecraft because it'd be like flying through a blizzard. narrator:<eos> Some tails can stretch for 1 OO million miles, more than the distance between the Sun and the Earth, as it travels towards our home star.<eos> It's one of the most spectacular spectacles of our solar system.<eos> - Today we're going to see what happens when we take a comet that's been in the cold, dark, icy outer reaches of the solar system, and we're going to send it inward towards its perihelion,<eos> or the point of closest approach to the Sun.<eos> Now, dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide, and this is a very common constituent of comets.<eos> Let's see what happens.<eos> When we take this piece of dry ice, and we drop it into the warm water the dry ice starts to sublimate.
Nobody has ever found diatoms in Greenland that came from the tropics to subtropics.<eos> narrator: The microscopic evidence pointed to a celestial impact.<eos> - What happens is, you get a huge explosion, and then this material goes up into the air and travels for hundreds or even thousands of kilometers.<eos> And then it's- you know, settles out.<eos> For a cosmic impactor to create a global atmospheric effect like the one suspected in 535 A.D.<eos> it must have enough mass and velocity to create an epic explosion.<eos> - The difference between a high-velocity and a low-velocity impact is, a low velocity impact does not create an explosion.<eos> I It can make a crater but it's not an explosion crater.<eos> What we're doing here is setting up to do a simulation of a hypervelocity impact in the formation of a crater.<eos> And we're using ammonium nitrate mixed with fuel oil, I so when we set it off it's gonna explode and make a huge crater.
Only, he made one mistake.<eos> He couldn't know Fox would commit a sex crime in Utah and leave his prints behind.<eos> None of this explains how he knows anything about Rachel's murder.<eos> I think you and I both know he probably didn't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Excuse me, Detective Burns?<eos> Thought you might like to see this, sir.<eos> Yeah, what do weot?<eos> Found it with Jensen's body in the van.<eos> I was vouchering it and it started ringing.
I just want to thank y'all so much!<eos> It means so much to me, and I just wanted to say I... I...<eos> Finn and Jake win the talent show!<eos> What?<eos> ! [Breathlessly] Awesome.<eos> [Panting] That... was... awesome!<eos> Oh-ho! Baybel! That was easy, wasn't it?<eos> Slimmin'? I'm glad we all guessed the theme so easily!<eos> What?<eos> What's that? You haven't guessed it?
Finn and Jake win the talent show!<eos> What?<eos> ! [Breathlessly] Awesome.<eos> [Panting] That... was... awesome!<eos> Oh-ho! Baybel! That was easy, wasn't it?<eos> Slimmin'? I'm glad we all guessed the theme so easily!<eos> What?<eos> What's that? You haven't guessed it?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Well, pause your viewer now to think about it before I blable it to you.
Ross Acklin. That's Mike's brother.<eos> You've already talked to him.<eos> "Meet at the Red Rose Motel, room 8, 10 a.m."<eos> Were you sleeping with Vanessa?<eos> No.<eos> But Mike was.<eos> I was setting up a meeting for them.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> He was worried that Debra would check his cell phone.<eos> I wouldn't put it past her.
The hughes h-4 hercules.<eos> Her wingspan is the length of a football field. She can carry a thousand men.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> Plywood laminate he used is called "duramold."<eos> Watch your head.<eos> We still use a version of it. For composite materials in miniature drones today.<eos> I tell you what I admire about howard hughes.<eos> The government tried to take this thing, And he told them to go screw themselves.<eos> He flew it once... Just once, to prove it worked.<eos> Then he put it away in storage for 50 years, Where no one could touch it. Yeah.
Go get dressed for success.<eos> Your sofa might be chic, but my neck is not happy with this kink.<eos> Would you prefer the kink of watching your father do it with fake Charlie again?<eos> No, I did not watch.<eos> I got the hell out before they saw me.<eos> The image is still burnt right here.<eos> To think that I used to consider Brooklyn a moral high ground.<eos> Now that my father's fallen off his pedestal, I'm free of such delusions.<eos> Your loss of faith in humanity turns me on, as does the fact that your book was rejected by Simon Shuster and you were dropped by your agent.<eos> I still don't get why they didn't want it.
8.<eos> Congratulations. You have a parrot.<eos> We couldn't even get through the toast to Haley before you pulled focus to Lily.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> It's-- it's a big day for both of them. Huh?<eos> Haley going to college is a miracle.<eos> Lily going to kindergarten is the law.<eos> Well, Haley and Lily aren't the only ones starting school.<eos> My mom and Jay are going to parenting class.<eos> We're doing it for the baby.
Oh, aren't you a doll.<eos> You know...<eos> Eldridge is with his father this week.<eos> Whoo, and Jake's with his mother. Mmm.<eos> So, I guess we can do anything we want.<eos> Yeah, and what do you want, you dirty girl?<eos> Well, you know what would make me really happy?<eos> Whatever it is, I'll do it.<eos> The guest toilet is broken.<eos> I want you to fix it.
This is Brian Brenner, everyone.<eos> It's possible he's going to be writing a feature on 2.0. But we're in a tryout period right now.<eos> Everything's off the record. Go ahead.<eos> What keeps our attention?<eos> Is the bottom right corner where they're playing a loop of little Caylee from a home video.<eos> Hell. Do you think it's as bad as everyone says it is?<eos> That was a tribute to Caylee.<eos> But how will they explain the duct tape around the child's mouth and nose?<eos> And how will they explain all the lies that Tot Mom told?<eos> Now they're not talking about the tattoo on Casey's back, but they put it full screen.
We're not in a hurry.<eos> We're actually in a huge hurry.<eos> And I'm actually at my job, where I work on commission. And I'm with a customer, so I'll be done when she's done.<eos> - Is that her?<eos> - You mean the only person in the store?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Miss, I'm just a random heterosexual guy from off the street, and I think that dress looks great on you.<eos> Don't even look at anything else.<eos> Buy that dress and wear it out of the store.
Oh my God, he's dead.<eos> Andy!<eos> Andy!<eos> Damn it.<eos> Andy McNichols!<eos> I'm not going to hurt you.<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> I talked to your dad a few hours ago.<eos> I saw your tricycle.<eos> It's sitting on the porch right where you left it.
We haven't got a lot of time.<eos> Look at this.<eos> What?<eos> There's a gap in the footage.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know, but we're missing a few seconds of Teller, outside of room six.<eos> It's the weirdest thing.<eos> When the footage starts again, this happens.<eos> Can you zoom in?<eos> Play it again.
Then all of a sudden he disappears and they started asking questions.<eos> Two days before he died, he gave me this.<eos> He told me to find you and give it to you, if anything... Don't touch it!<eos> Not now.<eos> Not till I leave.<eos> You never know when they're watching...<eos> What does the book means?<eos> My mother loved these poems.<eos> The book was hers.<eos> How come your brother had it?
I think we should find out what it was.<eos> Laboratory Of Climatology State University<eos> Where are we going?<eos> He could still be here.<eos> I need to get you somewhere safe.<eos> I called the police I'm sorry.<eos> I was scared.<eos> I didn't know what was happening.<eos> You just have to go. I won't tell them anything.<eos> I'll just say that someone broke into the lab and just vandalized it.
- You're in charge now.<eos> - I am?<eos> What's in that envelope?<eos> - My resignation.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> This isn't a burglary.<eos> Somebody was looking for something.<eos> Did your father ever mention a book?<eos> No. But captain Connors is looking for it, too.
Cliff was my partner.<eos> I trusted him.<eos> Looks like it could be a.44.<eos> - This is a.44.<eos> - The Desert Eagle.<eos> Probably the same gun he used to kill Wally.<eos> Then somebody used it on him.<eos> - What do we do now?<eos> - Seal the drum.<eos> Put it back where it was.
Lose the shirt!<eos> This is the best birthday ever!<eos> That castle sucks.<eos> This is where the king and queen live.<eos> My Allosaurus will eat them in a second.<eos> No, no.<eos> Play together, boys, or it's bedtime, all right?<eos> Fine.<eos> We can build the tower.<eos> And I'll get a bug and I'll put it on the tower and torture it.
Don't move, okay?<eos> Come on.<eos> His name is Dr. Jarrod Prodeman.<eos> He's a formerly highly respected epidemiologist.<eos> I was able to match his voice from the experiment video with some old lectures posted online.<eos> Why formerly respected?<eos> Well, evidently he was disgraced after he faked some data to obtain a research grant, and he hasn't been able to work since.<eos> Great. So he decides to start making biological weapons.<eos> Perfect.<eos> So Comescu gets the smallpox in Russia, gives it to Prodeman to modify, but Prodeman double-crosses him and keeps it for himself.
Evidence.<eos> Turner gave him a decoy.<eos> The real case never left, it's still in the library.<eos> I'm told Jack Turner has evidence incriminating Polyhedrus.<eos> Jack Turner is to be eliminated.<eos> Facing one's own mortality is frightening, but it's also an opportunity to find meaning in one's life.<eos> Hey, Alex, I've almost finished your book.<eos> - Enjoying it?<eos> - How does it end? - You don't want me to tell you that.<eos> That would spoil it.
What do you think?<eos> Seem like something he might be capable of?<eos> I hope not.<eos> But, then again, all men are capable of killing under the right circumstances.<eos> Yep. I remember when I could count the murders in this county on one hand. Two at most.<eos> Now I got a multibillion-dollar drug cartel right in my backyard.<eos> To progress.<eos> It's a cancer, Henry.<eos> And you know the thing about cancer.<eos> By the time you find it it's often too late.
It's on the house.<eos> Because that's what friends do, isn't it?<eos> They buy things for each other.<eos> You all look knackered.<eos> Have you had another party that I wasn't invited to?<eos> - They've all been playing Tokyo Sin.<eos> - Yes, bruv, Tokyo Sin is dench!<eos> Hang on, hands up if you've got this game.<eos> Typical, Joe, the only one of my crew with a little bit of sense.<eos> It's just that it's an 18 and my mum won't buy it for me.
Pass.<eos> Ava.<eos> Hey, there, Jackson.<eos> Who is very handsome.<eos> Would you mind telling my friend Ava about your summer home in...<eos> Tuscany, was it?<eos> It's really just a villa.<eos> On a vineyard.<eos> - Do you like wine?<eos> - Not as much as I adore it.
I admit that I was out of line with some of the things that I said earlier.<eos> And you obviously want something now.<eos> Well, I know how important it was for you to prove that you could best me publicly. And now that you've achieved what you wanted,<eos> I would love to buy my painting back.<eos> Well, if you wanted it so much, why'd you put it up for auction?<eos> I had no idea how much it meant to me till it was gone.<eos> And let's face it, Rufus.<eos> Do you really want that hanging in your loft, reminding you of me?<eos> I don't.<eos> We'll give it to a museum... one far away from Manhattan where you won't even be able to visit.
"I hope, stop that feverish mental pursuit<eos> "and put it all into what is my perspective.<eos> "Whatever we do, "we must not put any blame on Diane "for those events that took place in 1978.<eos> "We had been married, then, for over 10 years,<eos> "and our union was not a perfect one.<eos> "She had already experienced one major disaster in her life,<eos> "with the breakdown of her first marriage,<eos> "and the subsequent loss of the two children that she loved so much.<eos> "And now, here she was, stuck with a husband "who was useless at making her feel wanted, "and so, when she went to Montreal to do Toronto,<eos> "it's scarcely surprising that when love was expressed, "and then offered to her, she took it. "I'd always told her she should take a lover
And he just wasn't an option.<eos> So, I'm really glad that she was loved.<eos> I'm not sure she was loved by the person she really wanted to be loved by, but... Yeah. "when you make a documentary about your own discovery of a new father,<eos> "are you doing so to avoid your own deeper concerns of its real impact on you?<eos> "Is that why you describe it as,<eos> "'A search for the vagaries of truth "'and the unreliability of memory' "rather than, 'A search for a father'?"<eos> "Hey, Dad.<eos> "I've been thinking a lot about your last email.<eos> "Maybe you're right.<eos> "Maybe there is something underneath my need to make this film "that I've been denying. "Every time I feel I have my footing, I lose it.
My beautiful husband, Do you have any idea how impressive you are?<eos> Oh, stop it.<eos> Wait.<eos> Was there more?<eos> 'cause I feel like I cut you off.<eos> Halloween-ween is only one day a year, but you lead us every day.<eos> You provide safety.<eos> You provide us counsel.<eos> You do everyone's hair.<eos> You have an impossible job and you do it brilliantly.
Mrs. Stanfill?<eos> Yes, ma'am. It is.<eos> I hope that's your fianceé in there with you, Christopher.<eos> [ Sighs ]<eos> Yes, ma'am. It is.<eos> Oh, Rebecca Sutter, ma'am.<eos> What must you think of me?<eos> His daddy would crow with pride.<eos> Will you be coming to the wedding, Mrs. Stanfill?<eos> I wouldn't miss it, dear.
Hey, great promotion, Mike.<eos> Let Outdoor Man crush your old boat and get a $1,000 credit toward your new one. The only thing better than selling boats is watching one being crushed by a 16-ton killing machine. (Laughs)<eos> (Roaring and rattling)<eos> Man, that tank is crazy cool.<eos> I love tanks.<eos> Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to be a tank commander.<eos> Is that why you're always in a bad mood?<eos> Partially.<eos> Do you know what would be funny?<eos> If one of you guys bought it.
You know how upset you get when we go to the science fair, and the other parents do the work for the kids?<eos> (Chuckles) Oh, yeah.<eos> An 11-year-old kid can't even tie his own shoelaces, but he can make an exact replica of the Tesla coil.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, well...<eos> I will get the money back from her.<eos> This is the least satisfying argument I've ever won.<eos> Mike, I'm gonna apologize in advance if the tank smells like limburger cheese.<eos> I got it as a gift.<eos> Why don't you just eat it in your office?
- Yeah, sure.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Like, aren't into old people?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I mean, just-just horr... like giant walking raisins.<eos> They're in a home... It's me.<eos> I've been thinking a lot about you.<eos> Jess.<eos> I can't feel my arm.<eos> Whoa. I really can't feel it at all.
Are you in that much pain?<eos> Uh, he passed out.<eos> We need help!<eos> Yo. What's up, man?<eos> - How'd the audition go?<eos> - What?<eos> - For the Disney pirate movie? - Ha-ha.<eos> Hey, Mr. T called.<eos> He wants to punch you because that earring looks stupid.<eos> I mean, Lil' Wayne wears it, so...
I'm so scared, though.<eos> I don't want to lose her, Jess.<eos> She's my soul mate.<eos> For someone with a soul mate, you sure did have sex with me.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, and I don't expect you to believe me--<eos> I wouldn't believe me if I were you-- but check it out.<eos> I even bought her an engagement ring.<eos> That's... that's really beautiful.<eos> I've been carrying it around in my pocket for two weeks, trying to find the right way to propose to her.
That's a bomb.<eos> She just told him how to stay out of the blast radius. Stay with the cab.<eos> I want all eyes and ears on her until this thing's over.<eos> We'll alternate in six-hour shifts.<eos> I'll take the first one.<eos> That leaves me with the doom watch.<eos> Okay, so congruent triangles.<eos> Have you ever heard of the Donkey Theorem?<eos> Okay, give me the book.<eos> We'll look at it.
So you think you know more than God.<eos> "Our bodies are God's gift, "but they're also the devil's playground.<eos> "The devil likes to hide "in all your private nooks and crannies, "and if you open too wide, he might get out, or in." What--?<eos> Can we just see the condom demonstration again?<eos> 'Cause I don't know where Lou has been.<eos> Well, I-I wish I-I could, but I--<eos> Oh, screw it.<eos> Okay, here.<eos> This is a penis, right?<eos> You put a condom on it, and you pull the tip like this, and you roll it all the way down the penis.
Look, Addison, you may be very good at what you do, but I am excellent at what I do-- one of the best in the country.<eos> I didn't ask you for your opinion, and I don't want it.<eos> - How they doing?<eos> - How would you be? I just gave Dana a sedative, but Ron didn't want one.<eos> He wants to stay clear.<eos> I'm putting a GPS on Mason for reals.<eos> I know. I just called the nanny three times, checking on Lucas.<eos> (Cooper scoffs) This new guy's a douche.<eos> He's just doing his job.<eos> Pete did it better.
Did we have a choice?<eos> No, not really.<eos> But I'll get you out of here as soon as I can.<eos> Okay, open up your jars there.<eos> Go ahead, open 'em up.<eos> Yeah, reach in and pull out the pipe, and hold it in your hand.<eos> I'd rather hold on to your pipe.<eos> Uh, thank you, I appreciate that, but my wife frowns on that kind of thing.<eos> Where do you want me to put this?<eos> Just hold on to it.
Honor student at Sandburg Junior High and soccer star.<eos> Wyler's mortgage is affordable.<eos> His credit is good.<eos> Family only owns one car, free and clear.<eos> So we've found the most boring man in New York.<eos> See the black smudges in the air vent?<eos> Means your motor's fried.<eos> - Come back in an hour and I'll have it fixed.<eos> - Great. How much do I owe you?<eos> Ah, just buy your next drill with me, we'll call it even.
I'll tell you when you come round.<eos> Well, if it's a caravan in Wales, I'm leaving you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Go on. All of you.<eos> Let the girl have some rest.<eos> There's still a worry about Geoffrey.<eos> Graham will be in for at least a week.<eos> I thought Lizzie was looking into that.<eos> I left you a message on your phone.<eos> Didn't you get it?
Thank you!<eos> It's a pleasure. I didn't know what to get you.<eos> The hospital shop is full of tat, so, anyhow, you do drink, don't you?<eos> Cheers.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> It's been difficult trying to choose between you and Springer.<eos> Perhaps I should explain something.<eos> But I'd like to offer you the registrar position.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I don't want it.
Another lovely girl you've ruled out, in't it?<eos> We don't need to worry about the tattoo right now.<eos> The growth is in the substance of Alex's spinal cord.<eos> If the spinal cord gets damaged when we remove the growth then everything from here down would be paralysed.<eos> Paralysed?<eos> How do you mean?<eos> It's all right, Mum.<eos> It'll be all right.<eos> They know what they're doing.<eos> It's only fair I tell you that risk, but you should also know that if we just leave it, it'll grow and then, I'm afraid, it definitely would paralyse you.
Close your eyes.<eos> OK, now put your hands down.<eos> I stopped the operation too soon.<eos> I left too much of the tumour in there.<eos> You took a clinical decision based on the evidence available.<eos> Have you heard of Wilder Penfield? Yes.<eos> I've heard of Wilder Penfield.<eos> Neurosurgeon, epilepsy pioneer and, most surprisingly of all, Canadian.<eos> One operation he did in the 1930s - when he got into it he saw that this malignant tumour had spread, really aggressive.<eos> He took it all out along with a massive part of the patient's cortex.
I'm feeling better than yesterday and tomorrow I'll be better still.<eos> I know you don't want to worry your mum.<eos> I love my mum to bits but you don't really think that's the reason I'm saying no, do you?<eos> Dangerous operation, you said.<eos> One-off.<eos> And you asked me to trust you. And I did.<eos> And now, all of a sudden, you want to do it all over again.<eos> Trust you again.<eos> And the thing I worry about is this: If you're so bloody good then why didn't you do it right the first time?<eos> The tumour will grow if we leave it in there. And there will be side effects.
Postpone it?<eos> I'd do it right now if I could.<eos> Why don't we wait till her fits settle down?<eos> If she has a fit during surgery...<eos> We operate when fits become frequent and destructive.<eos> What you've seen.<eos> Would you describe it as destructive?<eos> Yes, but...<eos> And we know that they're frequent.<eos> If she has a fit during surgery, we'll handle it.
Time and place.<eos> Sweet as pie one minute and no-one dare cross her path the next.<eos> Bit like Bremner on a bad day, if you'll forgive me, Shepherd.<eos> You're putting her temper down to an aneurysm?<eos> May be a factor.<eos> It's abutting the amygdala. What does that control, Springer?<eos> Feeding, fighting and...<eos> Fornication.<eos> Well swerved.<eos> An aneurysm of this size, there's a chance that when we remove it she'll process emotions in a more measured way.
Would I have hit Shepherd if I wasn't your mate?<eos> I think he may have had an affair with Sarah Witney.<eos> Mike Law, aged 30.<eos> We removed an acoustic neuroma two days ago and preserved both his hearing and his facial nerve.<eos> Which basically means he can still smile when he hears us tell him he's good-looking.<eos> Duncan West, aged 42.<eos> Arrived two nights ago.<eos> Thought he was having a stroke.<eos> Our old friend the cerebral aneurysm.<eos> Called it, coiled it and Duncan's started to hate the sight of us.
- Ben.<eos> I said, drop them.<eos> He won't miss next time.<eos> Hey, Professor Mason.<eos> - Jimmy. What are you doing out here?<eos> - On our way back from patrol.<eos> You are a long way from the outer perimeter there, lizard.<eos> I'm just glad you're here.<eos> Jimmy, grab that rifle.<eos> We'll take it back to camp.
Um, not in a serious way.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fair enough. I'm based in L.A., but I'm in town for a few weeks.<eos> If you change your mind, I'd love to sit down and talk about what our firm can do for you.<eos> I'm flattered, but I... I'm sorry. I'm just not really understanding what you mean.<eos> Before you know it, your 15 minutes will be up.<eos> That's why I come in.<eos> I can take your 15 minutes and make it a lifetime.<eos> Well, I went to four different stores, but I finally found a costume.<eos> It's old-school, and I think you're gonna love it.
Just turn around a little<eos> Dont move<eos> I just came by to say goodbye.<eos> You're leaving?<eos> Yes, holiday!<eos> Where to?<eos> I'll just stay home Then I wish you a pleasant holiday<eos> Thank you!<eos> Goodbye<eos> The world is beautiful our lord loves it so
I just came by to say goodbye.<eos> You're leaving?<eos> Yes, holiday!<eos> Where to?<eos> I'll just stay home Then I wish you a pleasant holiday<eos> Thank you!<eos> Goodbye<eos> The world is beautiful our lord loves it so<eos> New is the human who loves<eos> The world is beautiful our lord loves it so
I'll just stay home Then I wish you a pleasant holiday<eos> Thank you!<eos> Goodbye<eos> The world is beautiful our lord loves it so<eos> New is the human who loves<eos> The world is beautiful our lord loves it so<eos> New is the mortal who loves like him<eos> We have found great joy It will continue to accompany us along<eos> We want to bestow this joy upon everyone So the world can sing along<eos> The world is beautiful our lord loves it so
That's enough, I'm finished It hurts too much<eos> This hurts. You know what? I prefer to stand while bending down a little<eos> This whole thing seems unnatural...<eos> A little devotion now!<eos> Now let's find some words-<eos> How do you manage to endure all of that?<eos> The knees! It's easy, and a little pain isn't bad<eos> I can kneel for hours There's only one way to explain that:<eos> As we all know woman have some sort of fat coating around the kneecaps this happened through femele hormones by nature<eos> By the way I observed that woman are able to walk around in the winter season just with thin thights and short skirts on and apparently they don't mind the cold while men can't stand it
- Okay.<eos> Then we can turn it off.<eos> There's no jury. Just me.<eos> Of course, Your Honor.<eos> My apologies.<eos> So there's no link between ad sales and search engine results?<eos> That is correct.<eos> Even if I wanted to impact the results, I couldn't.<eos> The algorithm acts on its own.<eos> We don't touch it.
Older guys like to flirt with me.<eos> - I have a nice laugh.<eos> - And then you two had sex?<eos> Yeah, but it wasn't a big deal.<eos> I told that reporter, it's not like I'm some Rielle Hunter.<eos> How many times did you have sex? Maybe eight times.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Was it always at a hotel?<eos> No, uh, twice at his apartment.<eos> Once, we were doing it in the bedroom and we heard his wife coming home.
Well, I could chip in. If you take my profits from the hot dog truck and add 'em to the $300 my aunt gave me for Christmas, I'd have $200. - Yeah.<eos> - Right.<eos> Let me think about it, but I've got to get to work.<eos> Oh, boy, I sound just like my dad.<eos> Which, I guess, makes me Mrs. Lemon.<eos> Seriously, though, I gotta get to work.<eos> Oh, I gotta get to yoga and lunch with the girls.<eos> Tracy, who sponsored your wedding?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There was a lot of fanta there, and the police, so maybe they co-sponsored it?
If nuclear weapons were deployed, the only logical conclusion is that their origin was in fact extraterrestrial.<eos> Is it possible that what we have here was in fact not an extinction, but an extermination event?<eos> Might the dinosaurs really have been exterminated by extraterrestrial beings, as some ancient astronaut theorists believe?<eos> And if so, could it be that some of them have in fact survived to this day?<eos> There are those who believe the answer is yes and that the evidence can be found in the creatures that exist right before our eyes.<eos> Solnhofen, Germany.<eos> 1861.<eos> Archaeologists discover a strange fossil embedded in limestone.<eos> Its features clearly identify it as a dinosaur, but with one exception: it has wings.<eos> They called it Archeopteryx, or "ancient wing."
We're gonna be the laughingstock of every town in America.<eos> You could be the mayor of that laughingstock.<eos> I won't be.<eos> The chicken picks Ruby every time.<eos> Okay, but what if it doesn't?<eos> Then she leaves town.<eos> I'm guessing that isn't the greatest outcome either.<eos> So you can understand my problem?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But does Ruby understand it?
Are you okay? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> - What did he do?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I don't know. We were just... We were just talking, and then...<eos> I'm so scared, Hal. Hey.<eos> It's okay. It's okay.<eos> Well, the idea is simple enough.<eos> We pump blood out of Captain Weaver into this chamber where we heat it up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit which, in theory, should kill whatever it is that's in the captain's bloodstream.<eos> Then we pump it into this second chamber where we cool it back down to normal body temperature, 98.6 degrees and then pump it back into his body.
- We hit the jackpot, boss. - Diesel?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We got three barrels full.<eos> Got two barrels of gasoline, three crates of 30-weight oil and a whole mess of fan belts.<eos> - Good work.<eos> - There's more. We just couldn't carry it. - Where?<eos> Uh, southwest, I think.<eos> I almost gave up, but I had this intuition and my daddy always told me, "Boy..."<eos> - Great.<eos> Uh right now, we gotta get this diesel over to the generator and load it up.
But what you're asking for... may save lives.<eos> Gotta be a whole lot better than a flock of reporters camped outside your gate asking questions you don't wanna answer.<eos> Captain Ruscitti:<eos> Your officers just pulled up.<eos> I'll give you whatever you need.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Captain Ruscitti, you know why we're here?<eos> Captain Ruscitti: Yeah, your sergeant can be very persuasive.<eos> He's right.<eos> I'll do whatever you need to find this stuff and figure out who has it.
I can't get that back.<eos> You didn't invest anything.<eos> Yeah, I did... my time.<eos> And I can't get my time back, so I guess we're even.<eos> It's just, like, fucking people.<eos> Shit, I met him.<eos> He tells me he's down to do one kind of thing And it's another kind of fucking thing.<eos> If I knew he was gonna bust out that "Yo, yo, yo" shit, I would've stayed home.<eos> I really liked your monologue.<eos> Like, maybe you could use it for something else.
What, is he dealing cocaine, too?<eos> Are you mad?<eos> He's talking about a chai.<eos> The white ayurvedic chai to be exact.<eos> It's loaded with antioxidants.<eos> We should all drink it.<eos> Tony, I tried telling Rodrigo right here about the rhino, he don't believe me.<eos> Really?<eos> What part didn't you believe, my good man?<eos> The part about you killing it.
You show up with that thing on your arm.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> - If you're supposed to die at the hands of somebody with this tattoo, I need to be on the approved list.<eos> - Nathan, I am not the enemy.<eos> - Your father, your grandfather, his father before that, they all killed Troubled people to wipe out their curses.<eos> You don't think any of them had any doubts?<eos> You just think you're special?<eos> - I'm gonna go with special.<eos> Nathan...<eos> Whoever took Audrey, they planted that whistle in her apartment, so you would find it and come after me.
There's this ex-army guy that I served with.<eos> He's working security at the port of Petersburg. - Maybe if we're lucky, if we're not too compromised--<eos> Eyal, I don't have my go-pack.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I gave mine to Zarya.<eos> What were you gonna do when we needed to cross into Finland?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I figured we'd work that out before we got there.<eos> The F.S.B. was not gonna let us on that train.<eos> At least Zarya can use it.
She's not even a proper goddes, she's only a handmaiden.<eos> And she treated you like dirt.<eos> She used you and then she dumped you.<eos> Yeah, it was harsh.<eos> Though, in fairness, apparently she was under some kind of spell.<eos> It's how they are, gods and goddesses.<eos> If you have a vulnerable side, they abuse it.<eos> True that.<eos> But... I need love.<eos> And I'll take it where I can get it.
Yes, I did.<eos> I went to parts of Norway, that are not on any the tourist map.<eos> I negotiated with giants.<eos> And I fought of ferocious dwarves attacks.<eos> And then, finally, and my strange... raven man thing, listened trusty god Hugin... And I... reached the mystical place... Where our search was fulfilled.<eos> Grandpa!<eos> I heard you ... you showed your thing to a hairy raven.<eos> I found Yggdrasil, Grandpa.<eos> Yggdrasil.<eos> Mom said me to find it, and I did.
And I remember one time when I was 14 years old... Uh, yeah.<eos> More on that later.<eos> We won't let you shut down the I.M.T.<eos> Brady, what are you doing?<eos> We heard agent Lattimer say that he's gonna shut down the I.M.T. and he can't.<eos> Tilson has to win!<eos> You can't just walk away from this.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But I will not give you back the astrolabe.<eos> I don't want it back.
Can I ask you something?<eos> Why do you like that American girl?<eos> Steady. Who says I do?<eos> Don't you?<eos> I suppose I do.<eos> And it doesn't matter that she's fast or that you won't see her again after she's gone home?<eos> She made me feel good about myself for the first time here.<eos> Alfred!<eos> Hurry up, I need you to take around the claret.<eos> Won't they spill it on the floor?
What is there to tell?<eos> One day I will die.<eos> And so will he.<eos> And you.<eos> And every one of us under this roof.<eos> You must put these things in proportion, Mrs Patmore, and I think I can do that now.<eos> 'Something happening in this house is about me.'<eos> 'Strallan is the traditional choice.'<eos> Edith is beginning her life as an old man's drudge.<eos> This is the moment you receive a huge fortune to save Downton and you give it away.
I'll grab a cab.<eos> - Later, Chin.<eos> She tell you why she let Wo Fat go?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> What do you got?<eos> Some info on Jake Madsen that might help us figure out who'd want him dead.<eos> Turns out Jake was kidnapped ten years ago.<eos> It was actually a big case at the time. H.P.D. worked it along with the FBI.<eos> He was abducted outside of his school, and the kidnappers held him for almost two weeks.<eos> They cut off his finger and mailed it back to his parents as proof of life along with a ransom demand of $20 million.
Damn drunk kids.<eos> Hey!<eos> What the hell's going on here?<eos> Will you shut up?<eos> It's started.<eos> They're coming for me and you're dead.<eos> But you don't know it yet.<eos> Who's coming for you?<eos> My boys.<eos> They're gonna cut your liver out and eat it in front of you.
I just got tagged by a bat! He got you.<eos> I got tagged!<eos> Suck out the poison, Dee!<eos> I'm not sucking on your head.<eos> Suck it out! I'll give you $200, you suck it out.<eos> $200?<eos> I'll do it!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> I'll do it for $200.<eos> Suck it quick.
Uh, hello?<eos> Hi, it's Riley. Hey,hey Riley.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Hey, Carlos!<eos> Very nice on the dishes there.<eos> Just -- just get -- I need the ribs, okay?<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Uh, sorry. It's -- it's nuts here.<eos> Uh, so, you got my gift, I guess. I did.<eos> I'm using it right now.
But all we're asking for is a parking pass.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right, you guys can have the pass. - It's cool.<eos> - What'd I say?<eos> What'd I say?<eos> Now, get on out of here.<eos> Oh, no, you don't.<eos> Devin.<eos> These boys just offered you a job, and you are taking it.
Cherry stem!<eos> Cherry stem!<eos> How you doing, Howie?<eos> You feeling a little better?<eos> Oh, a lot better, thanks.<eos> One sec.<eos> Listen close. I don't have a lot of time.<eos> I need you to go to my house.<eos> In my bedroom, you'll find a model rocket.<eos> I want you to take it and bring it back to your place.
Are you wearing lipstick?<eos> Mm-hmm. It's called "Ravish Me Red."<eos> It suits my porcelain complexion, don't you think?<eos> Hand it over.<eos> Oh, it's for you, actually.<eos> I hope you don't mind that I tried it first.<eos> We don't wear makeup. Mm.<eos> And I told him that.<eos> But Dr. Arden insisted.<eos> He said, "Red is Sister Jude's favorite color, and she'll understand just why I want her to have it."
- Well?<eos> - They are all there.<eos> Good work, Juliette.<eos> - You know how to pick them, Frank.<eos> - Juliette's not the problem.<eos> You bought her Caron's Poivre perfume?<eos> - Classy! - [ Frank ]:<eos> So what?<eos> When I was at that warehouse, a woman was there wearing that perfume.<eos> I'd know it anywhere because you buy me a bottle every birthday.
There's a radio station across the town square.<eos> But you'll have to ask tomorrow.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You are welcome.<eos> This one, this one's the hook, it's a 1610.<eos> It's a Tartuna. Quite big.<eos> Well, yes, those things can weigh up to 200 kilos.<eos> - Are they dangerous when hooked?<eos> - Yes, they're dangerous.<eos> The sevengill shark, when neither you nor the people that grab it knows, it's very? exible. You should never grab it by the tail.
Lift your head.<eos> Find the wind.<eos> - Daniel! We'd better go back!<eos> - Let's go back!<eos> - How are you feeling?<eos> - I'm having trouble breathing.<eos> With that ginger tea you'll be all right.<eos> We have dramamine, too.<eos> Dramamine for a sailor?<eos> You take it before you board.
You'll be better, okay?<eos> You were looking for Doctor Olivares.<eos> - Do you remember the phone call?<eos> - Yes, I remember.<eos> You should call the gas station in Jaramillo, and ask for Mabel.<eos> Yes, tell me.<eos> Have her tell Ana, her neighbor, her father is here, tell her please.<eos> Do you have a number I can call?<eos> No, I don't have the number, but it must be on the book.<eos> Okay, I'll ask the telephonist, we'll see if we can get it.
I got this.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> But is there any way you could squeeze us in?<eos> See, I'm an astronaut and I'm leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> I'll see you there.<eos> I can't believe we're not going to get married.<eos> Excuse me, I'm going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honor.<eos> So, I tell my wife,<eos> "Get a dog, don't get a dog, I'm not walking it, I'm not feeding it, I'm not picking up after it."
Well, I know how to make it special.<eos> I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music.<eos> Yes, you made that brutally clear to me.<eos> What I was going to suggest is if that you're willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena.<eos> You can have your wedding photographed from space.<eos> Oh... That's so cool.<eos> Oh, wait to go, Raj.<eos> I keep telling you, if I wasn't an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner.<eos> It was always a coin flip.<eos> Okay, so we know we're going to do it Sunday morning.
For what it's worth, there is a party, albeit much sadder and not nearly as nice, at The Rack.<eos> Really?<eos> There are people there who love you and some who may or may not be your friends who would love to wish you a happy birthday.<eos> Before it's too late.<eos> I think I'm ready to go.<eos> Before we go, there's something I should've given you this morning.<eos> Aww, Ben. You got me a card?<eos> It's not from me.<eos> It's from Mom.<eos> You're not gonna open it?
Settle down.<eos> You're not the only one with somebody inside this damn thing.<eos> You love Audrey, don't you?<eos> At least admit it to yourself. Shut up.<eos> I'm not taking advice from a walking purse.<eos> Hey!<eos> Relax, Crocker.<eos> If we wanted to kill you, this would be over already.<eos> How'd you find the barn?<eos> We had every member of the Guard looking for it.
Parker.<eos> We use the tranq gun on one, the rest will hear it and come after us.<eos> It's not like we can start shooting them. I mean, they may be Troubled, but they are people.<eos> I wish we could just call a bunch of backup.<eos> And say what?<eos> We've got eight to ten cavemen in a barn?<eos> We've discovered the missing link?<eos> Why do you think they're here?<eos> Shelter? I don't know.<eos> Let's give it to 'em.
Yes, sir. But chief, we just got a disturbance call that you should hear.<eos> - Haven PD! Hands up! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Easy, easy with the triggers, people.<eos> I'm a cop, okay?<eos> I'm a cop.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Then you know how to get on the wall.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Oh, I could've told you that.<eos> Badge is in my pocket. You wanna grab it for me?
Nothing's harder than doing something for which you know you're gonna take shit.<eos> Then why won't you just--<eos> Because if you're the face of the story, you'll contaminate it.<eos> Do you like beef stew?<eos> - Beef stew? - You like it?<eos> I guess.<eos> I don't know.<eos> - What are we talking about--<eos> - I like it.<eos> I used to make it for my kids on Sunday nights.
- Beef stew? - You like it?<eos> I guess.<eos> I don't know.<eos> - What are we talking about--<eos> - I like it.<eos> I used to make it for my kids on Sunday nights.<eos> Sunday was my night with the kids.<eos> Brown sugar and ketchup.<eos> You slow-cook it for eight hours-- That's the trick.<eos> The kids loved it.
How?<eos> Get to it before Buckells.<eos> No, sorry, Kate.<eos> Paranoid.<eos> I was missing the glamour.<eos> And the operation's been missing a blunt instrument.<eos> Gates hinted there was a financial connection from Jackie to him.<eos> Well, I studied his personal finances, there was never anything.<eos> No exotic holidays, no house in the country.<eos> If she cut him in on the money laundering, God knows what he's spending it on.
I guess not.<eos> Mr.Bohm?<eos> Well... that's about it.<eos> Looks like we're done.<eos> Couldn't we fix up these pews too?<eos> I mean,sometimes these mortise and tenon joints get wobbly.<eos> What do you know from mortise and tenon?<eos> Lots.<eos> Back in the age of the sail, you had to be able to fix your own mast at sea.<eos> Like,if a cannonball hit it or something.
- With the butter or the sauce?<eos> Make it two.<eos> And you know what I'd like with that?<eos> Just a little wine. Hmm?<eos> We don't have that.<eos> It's against the law.<eos> Still, in the back, inside the cupboard, behind the sody-pop.<eos> You know what's good here?<eos> The coffee.<eos> Brew it fresh every half-hour.
- God, we gotta get in there.<eos> I do not wanna miss them lift that 1,000-pound cross.<eos> For real.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> - We just gotta ask ourselves, W.W.J.Z. do?<eos> - What would- what would Jay-Z do?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - He'd probably rap about it.<eos> - ♪ He'd rap about it, and he'd rap about it ♪ ♪ And then he'd pass the mic to Blake ♪<eos> - ♪ Nah, nah, I don't want the mic, give it to Adam ♪
- We just gotta ask ourselves, W.W.J.Z. do?<eos> - What would- what would Jay-Z do?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - He'd probably rap about it.<eos> - ♪ He'd rap about it, and he'd rap about it ♪ ♪ And then he'd pass the mic to Blake ♪<eos> - ♪ Nah, nah, I don't want the mic, give it to Adam ♪<eos> ♪ So I'll pass it back to Ders ♪ - ♪ It's back to me ♪ ♪ I don't mind that 'cause I'm a R-A-P ♪<eos> ♪ P-E-R, where's my car? ♪ ♪ I mean my whip, guys, where's my whip, guys?<eos> ♪ - ♪ Rappin', stopping', I don't want the mic, Blake ♪<eos> - I don't want it.
Thank you very much. - Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> You know what? We'll come clean. We never bought tickets.<eos> We're lying to you, which proves we need to get in there and see the Lord's Force, so we can become better people and not liar people.<eos> - We gotta be saved. We're bad people.<eos> I mean, I used to make my, uh, G.l. Joes have huge orgies with my neighbors Barbies.<eos> - Yeah, and when I was a kid, I always tried to make my dog have sex with my cat 'cause I wanted a cat-dog.<eos> Turns out their dicks don't fit into cats, and the cat limps now.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> When I go to Subway, I ask for a water glass, and I always fill it with Fresca because I'm a monster, sir.
Taught high school history, coached football for a few years.<eos> Guess that didn't work out 'cause he started working construction after that.<eos> Put in a call to his current employer. Said Granger was fired last week.<eos> The reason why?<eos> Missed work a lot. He was pretty volatile.<eos> Had a few run-ins with the co-workers.<eos> Beating up his ex and taking his daughter with him, that's personal, but killing a gas station attendant means this guy's gone off.<eos> We're hoping we get a hit off the Amber alert before somebody else sets him off again.<eos> Well, my guess is he's gonna dump the truck.<eos> He knows we'll be looking for it.
But you still don't know the bitter taste of life.<eos> He won't die.<eos> It's just a tranquilizer gun.<eos> He'll be a guinea pig for my pharmaceutical company.<eos> You're filth to the core.<eos> But, it's too soon to think you've won.<eos> Huh?<eos> You ate that ramen, right?<eos> So what?<eos> Some salmon roe worked its way in when you were making it.
Whoever this guy is, he covered his tracks.<eos> Look, we put out alerts for Maddox.<eos> We circulated his photo all over the state.<eos> Someone will spot him.<eos> Well, we can't wait for that.<eos> Did you get anything?<eos> Well, there is one thing, but it's a long shot.<eos> The guy used voice-over-Internet instead of normal cell service, but he made a call in a bad signal area that got routed through a wireless network.<eos> Well, if it's a network, it'll have an I.P. address.<eos> Yeah, and we traced it.
Smith owns property in Lower Manhattan.<eos> This one-- 86 Markwell Street.<eos> That's what Smith said.<eos> He said "86" and then "Ma-ma-ma," like something started with "M."<eos> This building, this is where the file is.<eos> All right, so...<eos> The building is ten stories.<eos> How hard can it be to find a file, right?<eos> He would've hid it in a place that was safe from the demolition crew.<eos> Yes, which suggests that Mr. Smith not only owns this building, but he knows it inside and out.
Hi.<eos> Who's this?<eos> This is Taco.<eos> This is Michelle.<eos> Friend?<eos> Client? Both.<eos> Neither.<eos> Mm.<eos> How are you? Good. Hear there's a new case for a private jet company.<eos> They're comping a year membership for anyone who gets it, so... yeah.
I'm gonna go check on the others. You okay, Mom?<eos> Yeah, I'll try and get some sleep now that damn dog stopped barking.<eos> Dog?<eos> The neighbor's dog's been yapping.<eos> Finally, it shut up.<eos> Wasn't the clock just on?<eos> Michael, what's going on? Shh, shh, shh, shh.<eos> Someone cut the power.<eos> Hide behind the desk, don't move. Do it.<eos> Modern night-vision goggles provide visibility in near total darkness, adapt to changing light conditions, and provide better contrast and resolution than the human eye, which is why most assassins aren't just confident in the dark, they prefer it.
But will you talk all night long, Pauline?<eos> I shall lie here until dawn thinking of birds.<eos> Clara, captain the ship for half an hour.<eos> Denise, accompany me, please.<eos> What is it, Miss Audrey?<eos> What have I done?<eos> Sit.<eos> Tell me.<eos> What am I to tell you, Miss Audrey?<eos> I have supervised girls since before you were born. I know love when I see it. It never fails to disturb me.
You would tell me?<eos> I am just so glad to see you so in love, Katherine.<eos> Who can blame you?<eos> He is such a man.<eos> And he is clearly drunk at the sight of you.<eos> I am sure we'll find some time to talk in the morning and you can tell me all of your news.<eos> Jocelin.<eos> All right.<eos> So, which one's the ace?<eos> I saw you put it in the middle.
It would be appreciated. Thank you, Dudley.<eos> This is a sensitive matter for a lady of Mrs Brookmire's standing.<eos> We will do everything we can to contain knowledge of what happened here.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It is most considerate of you, Dudley, to think of these things.<eos> Darling... you are quiet.<eos> I might have expected you to be more exercised that one of your employees should cause such distress to my dearest friend.<eos> I am concerned, Katherine, I promise you.<eos> But I expect loyalty from my staff, so I must show them the same regard until such a time as it is clear that they no longer deserve it.
I am sure you'll appreciate that Mr Moray has put himself at great risk by keeping you on.<eos> If something like this has happened before, you'd be wise to tell Mr Moray about it.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Oi, that's not true!<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> My concern, gentlemen, is that no customer has ever purchased so very much and in such a flourish and, well, since the lady in question has an account, my question is...<eos> We now face a dilemma in calling in her account.<eos> I don't see why.<eos> It may seem insensitive in the extreme to send a bill to a lady who's been assaulted by one of our employees.<eos> But if we don't send it, we may seem to accept her version of events.
I'll tell you everything.<eos> I know you will.<eos> 'Cause I'm gonna have your son here with me.<eos> If you wanna turn the power back on, it starts with these pendants.<eos> There are 12 of them.<eos> Ben gave me this.<eos> He said bring it to a woman named Grace Beaumont.<eos> She knew something about the power.<eos> No, no. No!<eos> The thing about iron is, no matter how tough it is, you can beat the hell out of it and mold it into whatever you please.
Oh, yeah. Sorry.<eos> Um, "Earth to Rufus." That's a really cool name for a solo record, by the way.<eos> Admit it.<eos> Lily's visit upset you, not just because something could've happened to Serena, but because Lily would think there was something going on between us.<eos> All you've done is been a good person.<eos> What I've done is dragged you from one potential art gallery to another.<eos> I mean, if you have to see one more polished concrete floor...<eos> It was fun.<eos> And it was worth it, finding this place.<eos> Look, I'll call the agent, and I'll tell him you'll take it, and I'll go pick up the keys.
Oh, God.<eos> So all four came in in the last couple hours.<eos> Doc's got 'em on morphine.<eos> Says their-- their body is literally pulling themselves apart.<eos> Gives 'em, oh, two days tops on the outside.<eos> Well, I talked to Artie.<eos> He's gonna look for something to slow the effect.<eos> He'll send it to the hotel if he finds it.<eos> Yeah, but what does a heartburn pill have to do - with an artifact? - I don't know.<eos> Maybe it's some sort of chemical in the pill that interacts with the artifact when someone touches it.
People here do not respect boundaries.<eos> Homer, did you just buckle your belt through my loop?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Well, we're here to offer to throw you a little party in your honor.<eos> A little party might be fun.<eos> The only guests at our wedding were Ned's parents.<eos> Look at those squares, makin' it nice and legal.<eos> We didn't need a piece of paper!<eos> We had a paper, Nedward.<eos> We just rolled it and smoked it.
But in the meantime... you should do a rape kit.<eos> Just in case.<eos> I won't need it.<eos> Did he use a condom?<eos> Honey, you're gonna need to get tested for STDs.<eos> Scaring someone into getting a rape kit?<eos> Sometimes it's better to build trust.<eos> It's not gonna matter either way.<eos> - Have you read her book?<eos> - No. My sister gave it to me, right?
But it turned ugly when they were alone.<eos> She's not claiming rape, but she agreed to a rape kit?<eos> Well, reluctantly.<eos> She has anal fissures and a severe ligature mark on her neck.<eos> She didn't press charges?<eos> No, she's worried, you know, because of her book.<eos> Her prose is pretty florid, although I admire any author who can work in nipple clamps and Albinoni's Adagio<eos> - in one sentence.<eos> - You read this?<eos> The yentas at my mother's retirement home were passing it around and my mother's losing her sight, - so I read it to her.
Let's keep it that way, hm?<eos> Jocelyn and I were together four years.<eos> I thought we were gonna get married.<eos> - So she broke up with you.<eos> - She said it was her, not me.<eos> She had so much going on with the book.<eos> - So she was writing a lot.<eos> - I guess.<eos> She was really secretive about it.<eos> I didn't even know she was working on it, to tell you the truth.
Is this what excites you about sex, Mr. Cain?<eos> Hurting your victims?<eos> She liked it like that.<eos> You liked it like that.<eos> She didn't.<eos> Three days, jury's still out.<eos> Longer than the trial,<eos> SVU... it's the only unit where the victim's word isn't good enough.<eos> You have to prove that a crime was committed.<eos> That's true. They don't ask robbery victims if they wanted it.
I told you, I don't know where that bitch is.<eos> I swear to God, if anything happened to her, I mean, if you hurt her in any way, that won't be anything compared to the pain that I'm gonna bring down on you.<eos> Hey. Hey, I was here last night.<eos> All right?<eos> I was in this chair. And then I went home.<eos> There are cameras all over my house.<eos> Check with the security company. They'll confirm it.<eos> Look, I... I know this must be embarrassing for you, screwing up twice in 24 hours.<eos> But whoever grabbed that cop last night, it wasn't me.<eos> You know, Detective, I hope you have other interests outside this job, because once my lawyers are done with you, you're not gonna have it anymore.
- Normal?<eos> - Yes. Mom, please don't harass Dr. Reid.<eos> I'm not harassing her. I just want to know everything there is to know about your surgery.<eos> I'm so sorry, Dr. Reid.<eos> Totally fine.<eos> Now is the time to ask me anything.<eos> Wrong thing to say.<eos> Sandhya keeps saying that she's got a tumor but that it's not cancer.<eos> Now is this true, or is she just saying that so I won't worry?<eos> Leiomyomas are rarely cancerous, but after we remove the tumor, we will examine it under a microscope and make 100% sure.
- We did a worldwide search, and I threw Some of the sloppy seconds your way.<eos> All right, what-what... what about the things that matter, like intelligence, or the ability for cognitive thought?<eos> Uh, something that would give the kid a shot at being head of the Mathletes, like I was.<eos> I would like a skinny, blond child who doesn't cry.<eos> - Is this extra?<eos> - It's impossible.<eos> Not for our Platinum Members. - I knew it.<eos> - You can't be serious.<eos> Here's how it works.<eos> You click through our egg donor files, find your match, create a perfect embryo, and then implant it in a surrogate.
I'm not a predator, just a man with a plan.<eos> You've got a plan?<eos> We're all ears.<eos> There's a nose joke going, if anyone wants to pick that one off!<eos> In no particular order, we need to neutralise all the Daleks in this asylum, rescue Oswin from the wreckage, escape from this planet, and fix Rory and Amy's marriage...<eos> OK, I'm counting three lost causes, anyone else?<eos> Oswin, there's a Dalek ship in orbit.<eos> Yeah, got it on the sensors.<eos> The Asylum has a force-field.<eos> The Daleks upstairs are waiting for me to turn it off.
Could you please move?<eos> Don't roll your eyes at me.<eos> Uh, you don't need to go in there.<eos> That's, uh, just my stuff.<eos> You found it.<eos> You found the Blue Orchid.<eos> Yes.<eos> In your stuff.<eos> What's a $20 million missing diamond doing in your bag?<eos> Viktor's daughter said he kept it on his body at all times.
I knocked out number five!<eos> I kicked fear's ass!<eos> - That was so good. - Okay.<eos> Okay, that did not look so good. - You okay?<eos> - No.<eos> My ankle, my ankle, my ankle. All right.<eos> Okay. The token guy said this is the only silver unicorn on the peninsula, so you have to get it.<eos> Listen, I am a master on these machines, okay?<eos> I'm just getting a feel for this puppy.<eos> We'll get it this time. No doubt, no doubt, all right?
I did.<eos> She never saw what you were really like.<eos> I did.<eos> I was right to channel your urges instead of trying to suppress them.<eos> You think I can just walk out of here and call the whole thing off?<eos> If it were this simple, watching you for 24 hours a day, don't you think I would have tried it?<eos> Maybe you should've.<eos> How does it feel?<eos> This need to kill?<eos> What do you call it?
So, Britt, what'd you think?<eos> I'm once again inspired by the awesomeness of Britney.<eos> Thanks, Mr. Shue.<eos> This place is enormous!<eos> God, for 1,800 bucks a month, we could get a shoebox in Manhattan or this hangar in Bushwick.<eos> Yeah, but what's the crime rate like in this neighborhood?<eos> It looks a little shady.<eos> Ah, it's better than Detroit and Damascus.<eos> So what do you think?<eos> Should we take it?
I...<eos> You know we've been telling these kids for years to follow their dreams no matter what, so...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm not going to tell you to do the opposite.<eos> I just don't want to do anything to jeopardize... this-this new life we're about to begin together.<eos> It's not gonna change a thing.<eos> Okay?<eos> Weddings can wait.<eos> You have to apply for this position.<eos> And if you get it, we will cross that bridge when we come to it.
Yes.<eos> But if I catch you hiding your dinky between your legs and prancing around like Silence of the Lambs, you're out.<eos> (school bell rings) Rough day at Rydell High?<eos> Mom, when did you start to get...<eos> Big?<eos> Well, I battled my weight all through high school.<eos> And when your daddy and I had you, and I thought that it would fix everything that was wrong between us, and it didn't, that's when I started eating and didn't stop.<eos> Why are you asking me this?<eos> I didn't fit into my Sandy costume again.<eos> Every time I try it on, it just gets tighter.
You mean do something like conveniently protect the welfare of a student, so that it just happens to derail the school musical?<eos> I think that sounds exactly like something I'd do...<eos> classic Sue Sylvester.<eos> If you don't have a Rizzo, you don't have a show.<eos> Well, who says I can't find another Rizzo?<eos> Hmm? Me.<eos> Of course I can play Rizzo.<eos> (sighs) Are you sure?<eos> We open tomorrow and we just gave you the script.<eos> I was born to play this role. I've known it by heart since I was one, Artie, come on.
What? No, no. Oh, come on, one song for your old buddies.<eos> Guys, I didn't come here to sing a song.<eos> (vocalizing and whistling Kelly Clarkson's "Dark Side")<eos> ♪ Oh, oh-oh<eos> ♪ Will you love, will you love, will you love?<eos> ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh ♪ Will you love? ♪ ♪ Will you love, will you love?<eos> ♪ ♪ There's a place ♪ That I know<eos> ♪ It's not pretty there ♪ And few have ever gone<eos> ♪ And if I show it to you now ♪ Will it make you run away
You okay?<eos> Yeah. I was having a moment.<eos> You know, every year, over, like, an assortment of pies, my dads and I would sing these holiday medleys by the piano.<eos> And, I don't know, I'm just starting to feel like maybe that part of my life is over.<eos> Oh, sweetie, as long as we're in each other's lives, holiday medleys will never be over.<eos> Promise me?<eos> - How's it going?<eos> Oh, this bird is done. Oh.<eos> Yeah. All right, Kurt, do you want to do the honors?<eos> No, thanks. I'm not even having turkey after the way you guys manhandled it.
I know you can't conceive of me actually helping a member of my own family, and you're gonna continue to punish me for the derelicts of my paternal duties till I'm 6 feet under, but I think you're being a little bit harsh.<eos> Stop the speeches. You know what?<eos> I just wanna know, exactly what do you want from Teddy?<eos> 'Cause I know you want something. What I want is for him to pick himself up, dust himself off, and get back in the game.<eos> Mm-hmm. This could be good for you and the girls.<eos> It could restore Teddy's confidence...<eos> Stop. And his standing in the community.<eos> Tandy, stop it!<eos> Are you trying to lure him with the money?<eos> Is that what it is? 'Cause you know we're not gonna accept it.
Originally, they were smaller, but then I made them bigger, and I'm much happier.<eos> Check out the welcoming entrance.<eos> Is that what that is?<eos> At first I had a lot of landscaping down there.<eos> But then I said no good. I decided to trim it down, you know?<eos> Give it a nice, sleek, modern look.<eos> - You sure did.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But I keep thinking all day long about putting a monorail system in here.<eos> That goes in and out of the entrance all day long. In and out, in and out, You know the building wants it.
What, what just happened?<eos> A... A pure start.<eos> You didn't care if you died.<eos> All you cared about was her. So you sacrificed your own heart to save her.<eos> An act of pure love.<eos> Welcome back, Jinksy.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> You almost killed my dad!<eos> Your father had an accident!<eos> That you set up for insurance money, Siskel! And everyone knows it!
He offered 500,000.<eos> I told him we're not budging from six million, right?<eos> Yes, this has been hard, hearing him say we're greedy.<eos> The more they call you names, the more you know you're winning.<eos> Oh, would you excuse me a second?<eos> You almost done?<eos> Yup, in another ten minutes, we'll no longer occupy the 27th floor.<eos> How'd it look?<eos> Sad.<eos> We'll get it back, Will.
Nice.<eos> Your mother won't stop asking me why I look so tired.<eos> Why do you look so tired?<eos> - They look so cute together.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Think they look tired?<eos> Go to hell.<eos> The hybrid surgery was a good pitch.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> So why aren't we doing it?
You okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Want to have sex?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A little self-awareness never hurt anybody.<eos> I know they're trying to push me out.<eos> Got this watch at a surprise retirement party four years ago.<eos> I mean, it's a piece of junk but I wear it just to screw with them.
I'm calling it. Pfft.<eos> To pay for four years of college?<eos> Not all in one night and from the same house, man.<eos> Who leaves a baseball signed by babe Ruth out in the open?<eos> A guy who can afford another one.<eos> I'm exhausted.<eos> - Okay, now we call it. Come on.<eos> - I'm gonna check my e-mail.<eos> Can't sleep?<eos> Whoever said warm milk does the trick obviously never tasted it.
No, you won't.<eos> Once you've got what you need, you'll kill her.<eos> The minute I let her go, you won't text me the number.<eos> God, you've got to trust me.<eos> How could I possibly trust you?<eos> Send me the number or I will kill her.<eos> Nazir, if you kill her, you will never get this number.<eos> You have five seconds.<eos> Listen to me, listen to me, Nazir, listen.<eos> Let Carrie go and I swear I will send it to you.
Have you ever- Have you ever had someone who somehow... takes over your life, pulls you in... gets you to do things that aren't really you... that you know are wrong?<eos> But you can't help yourself.<eos> Do you have anyone like that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well... I've never been that stupid.<eos> You idiot whore!<eos> You think you understand me... or what my family have lost and suffered?<eos> You think this is just some fucking game?<eos> Nazir's not afraid of you. I'm not.<eos> I don't need your help. I don't want it.
Don't come out<eos> Yes?<eos> Umm...<eos> Are you alright?<eos> What?<eos> Yes. I'm fine<eos> I heard some noise<eos> A roach<eos> There was a roach<eos> Did you kill it?
Isn't Kim Cheol-min about 5ft 6in?<eos> Don't they seem too big?<eos> These fit you<eos> Don't they seem too big for 5ft 6in guy?<eos> Guess so But you can wear pants however you want<eos> I felt uneasy so I thought well and hard But this has to be an unmotivated murder<eos> That's why there's no suspect<eos> You think a psychopath did it?<eos> Usually, when a murder happens the killer will do anything to hide the body<eos> Bury in the mountains or sink it in a reservoir
Good-bye, endangered friend.<eos> [Vacuum hums] So, Connie, have you been taking your meds?<eos> Because I noticed you went a little more bat-shit crazy than usual when Woody mentioned the name Kirk Sanders.<eos> Kirk Sanders!<eos> Mm, mm-hmm. Like that.<eos> There's something about me you don't know.<eos> Before I came to Brickleberry, I was trained to be a Navy Seal.<eos> Sanders was my C.O.<eos> I was actually really good at it.<eos> But Sanders discovered my weakness. And he used it against me.
Walter...<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Can you concentrate for a moment?<eos> Carla Warren is here.<eos> My old dead lab assistant is here to haunt me.<eos> The one that was burned in the fire.<eos> The radio is picking up a transmission. We think it's from Donald.<eos> Do you recognize it?<eos> Okay, I ran prelims on the transmission through my encryption program, just trying to figure out if there's some sort of pattern hidden in the beeps and tones, but I can't make heads or tails of it.<eos> Okay, Walter, if they're right and Donald did send you a message, it makes sense that he'd expect you to know it.
Don't you quote Oppenheimer.<eos> Knowledge cannot be pursued without morality.<eos> You sound like a sanctimonious Southern preacher!<eos> I may go to church every Sunday, Walter, but I also have three degrees in theoretical physics, and I am telling you you cannot do this.<eos> We both know the amount of energy required to create a portal will forever ruin both universes.<eos> For the sake of one life, you will destroy the world.<eos> Some things are not ours to tamper with. Some things are God's.<eos> There's only room for one God in this lab, and it's not yours.<eos> The journal doesn't matter.<eos> Even if you burn it, it's too late now that you remember all the things you're capable of.
She's asking for a magnet.<eos> It's her.<eos> Send them.<eos> Send them now.<eos> My name is Simone.<eos> Carlos said you were interested in the magnet?<eos> That's right.<eos> I know this is a little out of the ordinary--<eos> Yes.<eos> We have it for you.
But there are mysteries to the universe.<eos> My gift is evidence of that.<eos> The fact that you are here is evidence of that.<eos> Your rational mind can't make sense of your loss but your heart, if you allow it to will find its own intuitive way.<eos> I'm getting a strong feeling your daughter's still with you.<eos> Even now.<eos> Simone, you have a gift.<eos> You can see things that other people can't.<eos> I don't doubt that.<eos> But wherever you think this gift came from or whoever you think bestowed it upon you it's simply an anomaly.
There he is.<eos> We saw that gang of turtles you were looking for.<eos> And we'll tell you where, for a price.<eos> Freeze, dirt bags.<eos> I think we can find them ourselves.<eos> Oh, man. This is awkward.<eos> It's Chris Bradford, my ex-friend.<eos> - And that other guy.<eos> - The name is Xever.<eos> So you don't forget, I'll write it on your shells... with these.
The book's entitled The Thing About Me Is I'm Perd Hapley.<eos> Anyway, let's start the bidding at $20. $20.<eos> Thank you sir, for 20. Do I see 30?<eos> Mr. Kurtzwilder, it might be helpful if you told us why you want to be governor of Florida.<eos> Well, I guess you could say mine is the classic Florida success story.<eos> I went to SFU law school, I was working at a small firm in Orlando, and one day, bam, just like that, gator eats penis.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Well, that was my first high profile case.<eos> It was a classic Florida divorce.<eos> Guy cheats on his wife with Dan Marino's masseuse, one day she cuts his junk off, throws it in the Everglades.
He was born here in The Paradise.<eos> He's more part of this place than I am.<eos> I love the lad as much as anyone, but you are to marry a Glendenning.<eos> Arthur is an errand boy.<eos> All the more reason why he should be here.<eos> I never want to forget what I am.<eos> - I'll have him fitted for a suit. - Dudley!<eos> You were the same last time.<eos> If you were as hesitant about business as you are with love, there would be no Paradise!<eos> It is going to be a great day, my friend, and I am decided that you are going to enjoy it.
Secret service is outside that door.<eos> Please do not shout the word "felony" in this room.<eos> We wouldn't even be in this room if it weren't for Hollis.<eos> Now, now, just a minute.<eos> We all jumped off the bridge together.<eos> Heck, we held hands.<eos> She means after the bridge and the hand-holding, when you went rogue.<eos> You freelanced, Hollis.<eos> You're damn right I freelanced.<eos> There's a big old mess, and hell if anyone else is gonna clean it up.
Why are you here?<eos> First of all, Kadooze on giving it up to Joe last night.<eos> Whatever you did, you did it well.<eos> And now it's time for this.<eos> I am not having sex with a chicken.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No. I am not asking you to bone a chicken.<eos> I'm asking you to debone a chicken.<eos> And then cook it.
I don't know where to start.<eos> Well, it's just that ever since the kaboom, you've sort of been walking around looking like Mr. Sour Puss.<eos> But I know that on the inside, you're one of the kindest people I know. So, I thought it would be nice if today, your outside reflected your inside.<eos> I know what you did for Ducky.<eos> That was very, very sweet.<eos> All I did was retroactively approve the exhumation.<eos> Well, it's a good thing you did because Ducky's cold case is warming up.<eos> I ran the tissue from the exhumed body against the class of poisons that Ducky suspected, and he was right.<eos> The commander was murdered with a poison called hepatic glycoside oleandrin.<eos> Where do you get it?
Sorry.<eos> What's it doing?<eos> Well, it's definitely not eating him.<eos> What do you do with a tranq rifle and a really hard bug?<eos> Maybe its underbelly isn't armoured.<eos> Fine.<eos> We have to flip it over.<eos> Like a steer? "Bug Rodeo?"<eos> I'll draw its attention, you lasso one of its hind legs, and we'll wrap it around from there.<eos> Sam! You get its legs and I'll hold onto it!
And the second one is stalking us.<eos> How about we just leave this one here until we can get help to move it, and chase the other one to the anomaly?<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I think it just wants to go home.<eos> It's been heading in the same direction this whole time.<eos> Maybe it's like a homing pigeon and we just need to give it a nudge in the right direction.<eos> So we can focus on the other one.<eos> I guess its food back home doesn't carry tranq rifles and taser guns.<eos> All right, let's do that.<eos> Now we're just pissing it off.
I purchased jeggings.<eos> I'm ready to get back to work.<eos> You went on the internet and searched "Mall of America."<eos> I am gonna be a team player.<eos> I mean it. I heard what you said, sir.<eos> Then put on some scrubs, young lady.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I saw you have a laser revascularization...<eos> You'll be working with Dr. Thomas for now.<eos> I'll believe team player when I see it, Dr. Yang.
- Nothing!<eos> I... my... god.<eos> Oh, Derek.<eos> You-you doing a consult?<eos> No, actually, I have a question for you.<eos> Do you remember the Donna Drake case?<eos> About six years ago, mother of twin girls.<eos> Remember it?<eos> I can't ever forget it.<eos> I won't ever forget it.
And the long-awaited wedding of Snow White and Prince Charming...<eos> Where, unfortunately, there was an uninvited guest who was in no mood to celebrate.<eos> I shall destroy your happiness if it is the last thing I do.<eos> Hey!<eos> Snow White and Prince Charming made a life together, but with a baby on the way, the Queen's threat became a greater concern.<eos> You have no idea of what she's capable of.<eos> What can I do to ease your mind?<eos> Let me talk... to him.<eos> "He" was Rumplestiltskin.<eos> At one time, he possessed great magical power, but used it for evil.
Against what, surfers?<eos> I'm serious, all right?<eos> 'Cause that is not a fair assessment of my skills.<eos> I am much better when I'm on the move and the target is talking smack and firing back at me.<eos> You still owe me dinner, Crustacean, 8:00 p.m.<eos> No sneakers, no jeans, and wear a jacket.<eos> Forget the garlic noodles.<eos> When am I getting my album back?<eos> It's a great record, man; it's irreplaceable.<eos> Then why don't you just place it in my hands?
Which is what?<eos> The US under martial law, with you sitting on a Hamptons throne somewhere letting the peasants eat cake?<eos> Yeah. Maybe.<eos> Look, you could have told me this on the phone.<eos> - Why are you here?<eos> - The order. 998.<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> It's wiped clean.<eos> Okay.<eos> If they're worried Chaplin is gonna use my prototype against them, who better to figure out how to help them defeat it than the people who made it?
It's a missile jammer.<eos> - Actually-- Actually, it's a multispectral array.<eos> It can trick anything you shoot at it, from an RPG to a Sidewinder.<eos> - It jams missiles.<eos> - And other stuff.<eos> Okay. Check it out.<eos> The Pentagon slipped a prototype to the Egyptian army for the War on Terror.<eos> But this man General Tariq Rafat, has fled the Egyptian army. He's taken the Sideswipe.<eos> He's on his way to Saint Lucia to sell it to Cyrus.<eos> - What's Cyrus want with it?
- He made his choices.<eos> I know. That's why I gotta go get him.<eos> Nikita, you know I can't authorize this.<eos> I won't stop you, but I can't send a team with you.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> I'm going alone.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> You can't be in Spain and Romania at the same time.<eos> Your plan to get Ari and the Sideswipe is good.<eos> You designed it. Who's gonna carry it out?
I don't know if I should say, but it's just so big, I can't hold it in anymore.<eos> Mom and dad have been keeping a terrible secret from us.<eos> We're poor!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What'll they say at the club?<eos> It's the truth, Axl.<eos> I accidentally peeked at dad's paycheck and saw how much money he makes.<eos> Sue, we go out after tornadoes looking for clothes.<eos> We know. We have to do something to help.<eos> I gave up my trip so they don't have to pay for it, and you guys better start thinking of ways we can save money, too.
Soon I realized it was fun<eos> After the mess you caused what is left of you two?<eos> So, what I'm doing is that insignificant?<eos> What you did ... I realize you just wanted to obliterate him<eos> Obliterate everything Hyuga did<eos> Someone should have stopped you when you said you wanted to cut him down<eos> What you have become is not pleasant to look at<eos> The Personal File system should become a world standard in information management and technology security<eos> From now on we're taking back the Personal File project<eos> Well, practically it will be difficult to take it back but there is a way to send it into the world with the form of our choosing
- For what?<eos> This!<eos> Leo!<eos> You could've been a little more specific.<eos> Where's the fun in that?<eos> - Get ready.<eos> - Chlorosulfonic acid?<eos> Leo, I think I figured out Shredder's plan!<eos> That acid reacts violently with water!<eos> So if he dumps it in the sewer...
And then there's a small square patch next to a barn that could be a private garden.<eos> Hotch.<eos> Back garden.<eos> Emma Kerrigan, FBI.<eos> Put your hands where I can see them.<eos> Emma, put that knife down.<eos> No.<eos> My daughter needs this.<eos> Look at her.<eos> Put it down so we can get her the help she needs.
Yo, you want some beer, man?<eos> It's gonna be great.<eos> Who's hungry?<eos> They did a good job with the house.<eos> They're gay.<eos> So the whole thing is made out of tofu?<eos> Yeah, it's a tofurkey.<eos> Actually looks like the real thing.<eos> Yeah, well, tofu is like an aging diva's face.<eos> You can shape it into almost anything, but nobody's really that excited to see it.
I think you guys should go.<eos> All right, I could say, "I'm sorry I disappointed you."<eos> But you know what?<eos> That's life. We're your parents, and we're flawed.<eos> Yeah, like it or not, kiddo, it's our flaws which have made you who you are, and from I can see, you've done pretty damn good.<eos> You must be getting your clock cleaned on property taxes.<eos> Hurry up, Marty.<eos> Did your little blue pill wear off?<eos> Hey, I'm not holding onto this pillow 'cause I like chenille.<eos> It's actually brushed suede, but why don't you keep it as a parting gift?
Hae Joo?<eos> The one who dumped him for an accountant.<eos> That Baek Hae Joo?<eos> You see?<eos> Yoon is the smartest.<eos> And what's that good for?<eos> What we need first, is to recover that ring.<eos> Chamber pot or newspaper.<eos> Choose.<eos> Once it's found, who's going to be the one to get it out?

You just had your sick leave the other day.<eos> You've been dating for 2 years, and I'm still on my 2nd day.<eos> Weekends are very important to me.<eos> Women can wait 3 times for you, but clients won't even wait for 3 minutes.<eos> I'm going to the site now. Drop by Se Ra's place later.<eos> See you later.<eos> Why is there no news from that woman?<eos> How is it going with the divided slope of the ski field?<eos> It's quite difficult to alter an already established proposal.<eos> I will definitely finish and hand it over early next week.
Our frequent customer either goes crazy while drunk or sings.<eos> She's such a bad singer.<eos> It's because I'm not drunk enough.<eos> The glass is empty.<eos> This wine tastes pretty good.<eos> Why wouldn't it be?<eos> Do you know this? This was designed by Do Jin.<eos> Really?<eos> Why do you have to mention that sort of thing?<eos> Of course I should, so Yi Soo won't drink it anymore.
I'm actually gonna substitute that for Guinea pig.<eos> "My Guinea pig hear my voice. "I know them, and they follow me. And no one can snatch them out of my hand."<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> I think it means no one can take the memories of Marshmallow away from us.<eos> They'll last in our hearts as long as we're alive. Aw...<eos> I'm still gonna miss Marshmallow. Oh, I know, baby.<eos> I wish David had remembered to feed it.<eos> But look at this little guy.<eos> So you know, I'm giving the new Guinea pig to my goddaughter, unless it dies.<eos> Then I'm throwing it in the pool with the other one.
It seemed to work just fine when we tried it, so...<eos> You haven't fixed it, have you?<eos> - We were just about to start.<eos> - Start? !<eos> See?<eos> I told you she'd be upset!<eos> Hey, Mara, we could really use some time off this afternoon?<eos> - If that's okay.<eos> - Is the chopper done?<eos> Not all of it, but we'll finish it when we get back.
See?<eos> It's like an iPad made of paper. Damn!<eos> You know so much about so much.<eos> There are a lot of things about me you don't know.<eos> We'd love to hear.<eos> Well, then...<eos> let's take a trip.<eos> Today, we took down Southern San Diego. Yes!<eos> Tomorrow, La Jolla.<eos> But before we do this, it is imperative for us to remember why we are doing it.
Our wedding would have the-the mints.<eos> We'd be... "Mint to be," committed.<eos> I was gonna tell my husband that I was pregnant by giving him a t-shirt that said "World's greatest dad."<eos> Now look at me.<eos> You're pregnant?<eos> I think so.<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Plans never work out the way you think they're going to, especially with babies.<eos> You try and try to get pregnant, and you can't.<eos> And then a baby comes when you least expect it, probably because you didn't plan it.
I'm so sorry<eos> During our pre-interview, Lt. Choi defiantly stated that Lee Doo-suk is not the real killer<eos> Do you have any concrete proof?<eos> To his fans' disappointment, he'll be arrested soon For fraud<eos> Between 1986 and 1990, 10 women were murdered<eos> Another went missing in that period but her remains are yet to be found<eos> I am certain that this is also the work of the serial killer, and this was his final kill<eos> Answer to his accusation is simple<eos> I did not commit that last crime<eos> Or you just don't have access to the information regarding it
Just ask Sister Chastity.<eos> I'll deal with Sister Chastity.<eos> You might start by picking a new name for her.<eos> You know, I thought by allowing you time in the general population that it would have had a civilizing effect on you, but clearly I was wrong, Mr. Emerson.<eos> So you'll spend the next couple days here, reflecting on your behavior.<eos> How can I reflect when my hand's tied down?<eos> You're disgusting.<eos> We all got our crosses to bear.<eos> Come on. Where's your spirit of forgiveness?<eos> I reserve it for those who are truly repentant.
- Who was messing with my van?<eos> - Nobody!<eos> - Jordan wore them for nobody? - No, no, no...<eos> We're not following you, Halpert.<eos> This ends now!<eos> Um, she will be right in.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Do you mind telling me her name?<eos> I realized we don't have it.
I feel guilty... there's too much to do around here.<eos> Aren't you supposed to have best friend day?<eos> Danny, you hate best friend day.<eos> The last time I talked to you about it, you called it "barf friend day."<eos> I love best friend day. I think you should go do it.<eos> Wait.<eos> Why are you moving all this medical junk in here?<eos> Turning Shulman's office into storage.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> We're turning it into my prenatal patient resource center.
I'll stay until 4:30 and only on commission. 15%.<eos> Ten.<eos> You got to help me carry my mom upstairs.<eos> You drive a hard bargain.<eos> Well, I learned from the best.<eos> - Fifteen.<eos> - Deal. Wait.<eos> Behold.<eos> Our catch of the day.<eos> Better eat it fast before a bird grabs it.
I gotta get back to work.<eos> If you're done with me. Yeah. Thank you.<eos> All right.<eos> Coffee?<eos> Sure.<eos> Fresh pot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah, I know Eric doesn't believe me, but I did lose his class ring.<eos> Wore it on a chain.
She's already lied to us twice, Kono, once about the cell phone, and about where she was last night. She did this while destroying evidence right in front of us.<eos> All without breaking a sweat. Commander McGarrett, we're gonna have to release her.<eos> No, not yet.<eos> We can't just hold her on a hunch.<eos> The car came back clean except for one sugar cane stalk.<eos> And as you know, that stuff's all over the Island.<eos> What about her cell phone?<eos> No signal.<eos> And there's nothing to contradict her alibi.<eos> And there's nothing to prove it either, right?
Amazing what happens when you don't give the bird a choice.<eos> You are a badass, Agent Gibbs.<eos> Okay, Captain, you're on.<eos> Hey.<eos> No harm at all if we come out of here with nothing.<eos> Right.<eos> All right, uh, I was right here, Lieutenant Torres was to my left.<eos> And, uh... I, uh... I first spotted Kersey at my one o'clock.<eos> He's shifty.<eos> He picks up a can of soup, but he doesn't look at it.
- Yeah.<eos> I don't know. Do you have a buddy you can hold hands with?<eos> Here, I'll sell this.<eos> Great.<eos> Bye. - Bye.<eos> - See you in a couple.<eos> How can he be mad at me that I don't want him to stay by himself in the house after he, you know...<eos> You know. If it was totally up to me, then I probably would've let them stay here.<eos> You know, if they want to have sex, they're gonna find a place to have sex.<eos> - And they might as well do it in a safe environment.
We'll see you in court.<eos> Parents Against Indecency have bombarded the FCC with letters and complaints regarding Ms. Dodd's little stunt.<eos> And our expectation is the FCC will fine us the maximum:<eos> - $3 million.<eos> - Mr. Preston, we've already made clear our client can't...<eos> Over the next two days, I'm meeting individually with three of the FCC commissioners to lobby them.<eos> The three swing votes.<eos> There is one thing your client can do to quash our suit.<eos> Apologize.<eos> Tell them the saintly story of her mom dying of cancer, and her sense of overexuberance at wanting to do something about it.
Burl.<eos> David... what can we do for you?<eos> Oh, I'm just watching.<eos> Continue.<eos> Mr. Lee, this is a private matter.<eos> It's far from private.<eos> I'm just waiting for my emancipation.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Your emancipation? Yes.<eos> This firm has a stranglehold on me, but as soon as you purchase it, I'm free. Hallelujah.
And if she does, she will be a threat to everyone, including your son.<eos> So if you truly want to be a good mother to Henry, to protect him, if you want to be better, prove it.<eos> Rumplestiltskin's cell.<eos> I haven't been here since before Regina's curse.<eos> This is where he told us you were going to be the savior.<eos> He knew?<eos> Oh, it was prophesized.<eos> Come on.<eos> The squid ink... it's not here.<eos> Gold said we would find it.
A book that has spells in it?<eos> Watch.<eos> Squid ink.<eos> Gold wrote the scroll in squid ink.<eos> Told ya.<eos> Good always wins.<eos> Wait. I can't go. You have to tie me up.<eos> I'm not leaving without you.<eos> I can't be trusted, not as long as Cora has my heart.<eos> Then I will get it back for you.
Well, yeah, it's wiped out all the other evidence as far as I can see.<eos> W-What do you mean,<eos> "from now on?"<eos> I mean for the foreseeable future.<eos> They will adopt him.<eos> I don't have a box for infinity.<eos> I mean, the furthest I went was a month. Okay.<eos> Then I'll take the month.<eos> Our killer is sick and smart. I hate that combination.<eos> Okay, so, this program will search for wrinkles, freckles, and other microscopic facial features on each piece, pick up the pattern, and pair it with the corresponding piece.
In case he runs?<eos> Or they come back and finish the job.<eos> Copy that.<eos> So, I'll see you back at Ops?<eos> Nice try-- you're my ride.<eos> Besides, you and I could use some quality time.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Yeah, what do you got, Nell?<eos> I got a hit on a clown costume.<eos> Yeah, pass that one on to Kensi. She can check it out on her way back.
No refunds, exchange only.<eos> We don't need a refund-- we need some answers.<eos> Do you recognize this guy?<eos> Nope.<eos> You recognize him in your costume?<eos> No exchanges once it's worn.<eos> That guy's dead.<eos> No exceptions.<eos> Who bought the costume?<eos> It wasn't the guy who was wearing it?
Something's not right.<eos> That was too easy.<eos> We're good, but we're not that good.<eos> Whoever killed Duncan left him with the gold. Why?<eos> He was at death's door.<eos> The shooter could have casually hauled away the gold.<eos> Why not take it?<eos> We could've spooked him.<eos> Got there before they had a chance.<eos> Or maybe they wanted us to find it.
Comes back to the cargo van driver.<eos> If they melted the real gold to coat more bars of tungsten... You could duplicate the gold bars several times over.<eos> Turning millions into billions before anyone got caught.<eos> Why didn't I think of that?<eos> Um, so I could solve the case. I'm not a thief.<eos> Is there something we should know about you, Eric?<eos> Uh, what do you, what do you got for us, Nell?<eos> Anyway... tungsten is about 50 bucks a kilo and the gold bars are 12.4 kilos each, so we're talking about a loof weight.<eos> Eric, we're gonna need to know who's been buying tungsten.<eos> And we're gonna need somewhere where we can smelt it.
Now, let's talk running backs. You've got them and I want them.<eos> (weakly):<eos> You know I don't have 'em. Do it.<eos> I don't.<eos> Do it.<eos> (crying):<eos> No.<eos> I'm taking advantage of you!<eos> You trade-roofied me.<eos> Just 'cause you made a bad trade doesn't mean that you can just cry and then we can change it at the last second.
- Oh, how are you gonna fit a murder into that?<eos> It was a joke.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's funny because a murder would be inappropriate for a toddler.<eos> You got it.<eos> Why does your office smell like Thanksgiving?<eos> I'm testing my pod theory. By roasting turkeys?<eos> In a manner of speaking, yeah.<eos> The pod containing our victim's remains showed the same chemical properties as normal types of plastic sheeting, only harder.<eos> See, after the victim was murdered, right, the killer wrapped the body in plastic, then dumped it onto the trash barge where it was exposed to direct sunlight.
Make way!<eos> I guess he couldn't tolerate the injustice.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Don't mind him too much.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What?<eos> I heard that they're going to build a palace annex.<eos> Didn't you know?<eos> Not only that, they're planning to build it on top of the river.
Yeah?<eos> Um, Mr. Gold, you better come out here.<eos> You're gonna want to seize the hard drives, all the cell phones.<eos> Someone's got to get started on those files over there. Hi, Mr. Gold.<eos> So good to see you again.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> We are raiding your office.<eos> You're gonna want to wrap up that call right now. Over there.<eos> Yep.<eos> Shut it down, shut it down.
I sold him the laptop.<eos> I got him killed.<eos> - Is the laptop still here?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> He told me he found a buyer this morning.<eos> He paid me my share.<eos> Mr. Mansoor sold the laptop before his demise at the hands of the Estonians.<eos> They trashed this place looking for it.<eos> How'd they know to come here?<eos> Pushkov may have installed a beacon that turns on when you power it up.
And ... and that whatever surgical procedure you're having is risky.<eos> It is ... very.<eos> Well, how risky? Like, "you're gonna die" risky?<eos> More likely, I'll end up a full paraplegic.<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> - I told you it wasn't romantic.<eos> Well, then, why do it?<eos> Okay, why make things worse?<eos> This catheter.<eos> - I was about to put it in when y...
It better mean, "Whatever you say, Jess."<eos> I don't think it's fair that women have an excuse once a month to act irrationally angry when the rest of us have to keep it together all the time.<eos> You're irrationally angry 365 days a year, Nick.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I will push if I want to push!<eos> Come on!<eos> I hate doors! Really?<eos> Well, that's just your personal opinion, 'cause I don't have anger issues.<eos> You guys think I have anger issues?<eos> Well, I mean, I wouldn't exactly call it an issue.
Hello, Will.<eos> Hi. So, why don't I go get us another drink, so you two can talk?<eos> That would be great.<eos> Stay focused.<eos> Got it.<eos> So... how have you been?<eos> Why'd you give me that nickname in high school? What? !<eos> What-what are you talking about?<eos> You called me...<eos> I'm not gonna say it.
What's that?<eos> Oh, I got a new bed for Maddie.<eos> Kate not tell you I'm building Maddie a loft?<eos> Yeah, guess how many nails I'm using.<eos> Less than one.<eos> What up?<eos> Yeah, well, she just wasn't sure that you were gonna finish it, so...<eos> Wasn't sure I was gonna finish it, huh?<eos> That's a natural reaction.<eos> Start a project, don't finish it, though, you know?
All right!<eos> Put out the fire, buried my TP and hung the bear bag.<eos> See?<eos> Camping doesn't have to be fancy to be fun.<eos> Quickly, easily zip the...<eos> I'm gonna get all snug like a little bug in a rug.<eos> Don't want any heat escaping.<eos> Why do we hang a bear bag?<eos> Well, you see, bears can smell food from a half a mile away.<eos> So wouldn't they smell it in a tree?
- Babe, that's really good.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Wait, there's a sign up there.<eos> What does it say?<eos> Welcome to... Palm Desert.<eos> Think I should put the snow chains on, or?<eos> Yes.<eos> Wow. We are such losers.<eos> Ava, I was gonna give this to you on Christmas, but I thought maybe you could use it now.<eos> If it isn't a set of hand-carved nesting dolls that ends in a cyanide tablet then I don't want it.
Please, I need you. I can't do this without you after everything I learned today about my mom.<eos> You're here.<eos> Just... be here with me.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Dude, dude.<eos> Did I hurt you?<eos> Nothing a Care Bears Band-Aid can't fix.<eos> Vincent, dude, it's okay.<eos> We've got a plan. We'll test Vanessa's serum on Stallone and...<eos> It's just a matter of time before we test it on you.
Are you injured anywhere?<eos> I'm fine. It doesn't hurt.<eos> What was so urgent that you needed to jump down so recklessly?<eos> I was worried that my fish would dry out so I came to water it.<eos> I've repaired it.<eos> The other reason I came was to get this back from you.<eos> Really?<eos> Does putting it on for me really make you that happy?<eos> Yes.<eos> Putting it on for you makes you mine, and to seal it...
Where did you...<eos> Hey.<eos> Amnesia.<eos> Hey!<eos> What are you doing with someone else's hairpin?<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> It's mine.<eos> It can't be.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> I was wearing it when I died.
How did she get my mother's hairpin?<eos> Isn't this part of the magistrate's residence?<eos> But why is the gate closed so tightly?<eos> It looks like whoever lived here just disappeared.<eos> What was that?<eos> What are they doing over there?<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> As soon as they put it out, you must grab it immediately.
Who's this?<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> I've never gotten out of the way when there was offering rice.<eos> I was here first!<eos> Hey.<eos> Say it properly.<eos> We were here first!<eos> My kid was the first one to hear about it!<eos> You guys are funny.<eos> Offering rice belongs to the one who gets it first.
You aren't my mother.<eos> There was never an instance where my mother looked at me when I smiled.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For telling you not to look for me.<eos> For telling you to die in your father's yard.<eos> Most of all, for telling you all that when you gave your bad mother a present with all your heart.<eos> Present?<eos> If only I can wear that hairpin to show you...<eos> What kind of hairpin?<eos> Didn't you give it to me?
They will consent to the wedding.<eos> Keep close watch over her.<eos> We don't want anything to interfere with our next move.<eos> Let Sola have a hatchling.<eos> Sola can take the little white worm.<eos> Be still.<eos> Be still!<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Be still.<eos> Now we kill it.
- Not sure I follow you, old thing.<eos> He's seen the painting and he's considering being intrigued.<eos> - Considering?<eos> - Considering being, yes.<eos> - Where's the girl?<eos> - In a hotel in Dallas.<eos> - Why is she in a hotel in Dallas?<eos> - The passport office is there.<eos> It turns out that the dear girl's never been out of the country.<eos> Now, ordinarily, a passport takes eight weeks, but they can expedite. Pay a couple of hundred pounds, they'll hurry it along.
I want £12 million for this here picture. That's 6,000 tons if I've clone my math right.<eos> And maybe you'd like to throw in a nice four-by-four to haul it off in, with an auto tranny, a CD deck and graduated tint on the windshields.<eos> Please and thank you.<eos> Well, that's marvellous, and tell me, PJ, what makes you think this painting is worth £12 million?<eos> Well, Lionel, first off, it's oil. Ain't it, Harry?<eos> Indeed, the medium is oil, and its provenance is promising.<eos> But I would like to take it to your country house to compare it to its mate.<eos> - Is it being shipped in?<eos> - Arrives Tuesday.<eos> You can run it up to the house.
Love?<eos> Must we?<eos> I was probably the worst bed partner on five continents.<eos> All my life, idiotically,<eos> I thought that sex seemed to matter so desperately to the man who wanted it that to withhold it was like withholding bread, an act of selfishness.
Life shouldn't be this perfect.<eos> It really shouldn't.<eos> It absolutely should.<eos> A perfect moment.<eos> But it's all still out there.<eos> - What's all still out there?<eos> - The world.<eos> Collier's wants me to go to Finland.<eos> - Marty.<eos> In this world, when you find a good place, you don't leave it.
That's right.<eos> Without surprises. Without animals or islands.<eos> Yes. The truth.<eos> So, what did you do?<eos> I told them another story.<eos> Four of us survived.<eos> The cook and the sailor were already aboard.<eos> The cook threw me a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard... and Mother held on to some bananas and made it to the lifeboat.<eos> The cook was a disgusting man. He ate a rat.<eos> We had food enough for weeks, but he found the rat in the first few days... and he killed it, dried it in the sun and ate it.
Where's the couch from the Humphrey loft?<eos> It was blue and it was suede and it was quilted and it was quite lovely.<eos> I would like the Humphrey jukebox...<eos> 'Cause I feel like it's loaded with "early '90s hits"<eos> Yeah. From... from the time of lincoln Hawk's reign.<eos> We've talked about stealing things.<eos> We've all tried.<eos> I kinda want to take that, the statue there.<eos> We call it "Chuck Brass".<eos> Or I'd like to take the pool table, but I'd have to get chace to carry it on his back.
Hey, my brother, what's happening, brother?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Hey!<eos> Was that a drive-by?<eos> What was that?<eos> Somebody tell me, was that a drive-by?<eos> Thanks, son!<eos> White people sure is nice!<eos> Hey, Mr. McCall.<eos> Hey, about my book, any chance you read it yet?
Yeah, I understand. I couldn't reach you!<eos> Well, that's how this works.<eos> Well, I had to make a decision!<eos> - These locals, I want their names.<eos> - It's in the file.<eos> Any of them know who you are?<eos> Just one, but I took care of it.<eos> - Where's the body?<eos> - It's distributed.<eos> Relax! No one's gonna find it.
A conspiracy to kill five random people?<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Four.<eos> Four random people.<eos> To hide one specific target.<eos> Someone needed Oline Archer's construction business.<eos> And Oline wouldn't let it go.<eos> It's a convincing theory.<eos> But it's just a theory.<eos> The first round is the least accurate. The snipers call it a cold shot.
Agent Hill.<eos> Those cards, they were in Coulson's locker not in his jacket.<eos> They needed the push.<eos> We have an unauthorized departure from Bay 6.<eos> They found him.<eos> Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do.<eos> - I want eyes on everything.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor but the device is already self-sustaining.<eos> Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.<eos> So find a tight corner.<eos> I will roger that.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Nice call.<eos> What else you got?<eos> Thor is taking on a squadron down on Sixth.<eos> And he didn't invite me.<eos> Captain, none of this is going to mean a damn thing if we don't close that portal.<eos> Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.
Quickly!<eos> All of you!<eos> Come on!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Eight, nine, ten.<eos> Kili!<eos> Run!<eos> Elves.<eos> I cannot see where the pathway leads.<eos> Do we follow it or not?
Very nice.<eos> Not your average run-of-the-mill nutcase, is he, dear?<eos> You're kidding.<eos> Peggy, this is the boy who dug up his own mother.<eos> Hungry?<eos> Famished.<eos> Well, you can have half a grapefruit later if you're good.<eos> Now, listen, Hitch...<eos> Whit gave me the galleys to his new book yesterday at lunch.<eos> I've already got some ideas about how we can adapt it.
Do you remember the fun we had when we started out all those years ago?<eos> We didn't have any money then, did we? We didn't have any time, either.<eos> But we took risks, do you remember?<eos> We experimented.<eos> We invented new ways of making pictures... because we had to.<eos> I just want to feel... that kind of... freedom again.<eos> Like we used to, you know?<eos> We are about to propose a restructured deal for Psycho.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> We finance it. Independently.
One simply has to maximise your appeal... bring out all your qualities... and make you look, and sound, like the leader that you could be.<eos> You've got it in you to go the whole distance.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Prime Minister?<eos> In Britain?<eos> There will be no female Prime Minister here, not in my lifetime.<eos> And I told Airey, I don't expect to win the leadership, but I... am going to run.<eos> Just to shake up the party.<eos> Respectfully, Margaret, I disagree.<eos> If you want to change this party, lead it.

Give 'em hell!<eos> You look magnificent.<eos> Next stop Prime Minister.<eos> The leader of the Conservative Party, Margaret Thatcher!<eos> Good night Margaret.<eos> My money's on the filly to win!<eos> Oh, thanks Airey.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> The Irish National Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for the... death of Airey Neave, Margaret Thatcher's spokesman on Northern Ireland.<eos> If you want to change the party, lead it.

You don't have to do anything.<eos> - That's the whole point!<eos> - Yes, I do. It's doesn't have to be work.<eos> You don't have to clean and buy a new outfit. - Oh, I'm supposed to leave... - ... and think of the goddamn theme cocktail for every party.<eos> We can just invite people over to hang out and drink whatever we have.<eos> Let's talk about it later.<eos> Oh, shit, Matt, is everything okay?<eos> Is there any news?<eos> In fact there is.<eos> I'll tell you about it in a moment.
- That one is good.<eos> Don't think with your dick, okay?<eos> This is important stuff and that's just slutty.<eos> - Okay okay.<eos> - Uh, hey.<eos> What have you got that's special?<eos> I won a beauty competition once.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Where?<eos> Where did you win it?
She was the daughter of Ra who was the Egyptian sun god.<eos> Remember that movie with Dr. Jones, the whole map room with the stick and the little red jewel and the light went through?<eos> Okay, well, these dudes rebelled against him and Sekhmet got really pissed, so she went crazy.<eos> She slew them all and she drank all their blood.<eos> -Sounds like my ex-wife.<eos> -I said, "Slew them all."<eos> So anyhow, she created this staff that was powered by the souls of the dead.<eos> She was gonna go on a killing spree and kill everyone.<eos> The gods intervened and they fooled her with beer and pomegranate juice.<eos> She thought it was a river of blood and she drank it all.
Because one moment of impatience can ruin a whole life.<eos> Shark.<eos> Smart.<eos> I read the sports section every morning.<eos> The sports section shows a person's accomplishments.<eos> The front page shows a person's failures.<eos> Two.<eos> But unlike a serious sport that has nothing to do with fair play this is bound by boastfulness, hatred, total disregard for rules and a sadistic pleasure in violence.<eos> You know what I call this shot?<eos> I call it the steamroller.
"How do you know it will work?<eos> " He said, "I don't.<eos> I'll find out when I die."<eos> And, you know, it's so great.<eos> It's like that was it.<eos> I'll, I'm practising this so that when I die I will know how to leave my body and I'll be familiar and I won't be frightened.<eos> George had a maximum amount of diversion in life.<eos> And, you know, towards the end of his life, he'd say, like,<eos> I'd say, "Oh, you know they want to give you this award thing".<eos> And he said, "Well, I don't want it.
So at best, you got eight years.<eos> Then you end up at a nice consultant firm off Farragut North, making 750 grand a year, eating at The Palm, pimping out ex-senators to Saudi princes.<eos> Pimping out ex-presidents.<eos> Then I better win.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now, I've been married for 11 years.<eos> We have a normal marriage.<eos> Which means when we disagree, she wins.<eos> What we don't disagree on is how we're gonna leave this planet for our daughter.<eos> Are we gonna leave it better off or worse?
As a xenobiologist, your skills are specifically suited to the task.<eos> Beyond that... I'm not at liberty to tell you.<eos> Hello.<eos> The eyes, nose, ears and mouth are humanoid.<eos> In the left anterior thoracic region is a 10-centimeter wound... with jagged edges containing attached cyanotic-colored coagulum.<eos> Okay, all right.<eos> Place the ring, then speak the oath.<eos> The oath.<eos> Because everybody knows the oath.<eos> Used to sing it in camp.
The stars you can see from your home planet on the clearest night... your sector is a thousand times larger.<eos> And 3600 Lanterns, each with a sector just as vast.<eos> Lanterns, I've called you here to this unprecedented gathering... because we face an unprecedented danger.<eos> Our four Lantern brothers were killed by an enemy called Parallax.<eos> An enemy we don't yet fully understand.<eos> We do know it's powerful enough to destroy entire civilizations.<eos> Powerful enough to defeat even Abin Sur... our finest warrior... whose light can never be replaced.<eos> The Guardians have charged me to lead a squadron of Lanterns... in an assault on Parallax.<eos> We will seek out and find this enemy.<eos> And we will destroy it.
Hey, carefully.<eos> I have decided to take you with me to Berlin.<eos> Maybe I will get your picture in the paper.<eos> "Leader of the resistance, hanged".<eos> Don't worry, we have an abundance of information... about where your forces have gathered. We will travel unfettered. We may even get lucky,<eos> And the Fuhrer shall see you hanged.<eos> You, are an amazing specimen.<eos> A true discovery.<eos> I have drained you for almost an hour.<eos> You produce blood as fast as I extract it.
Drink up.<eos> I'm off in 10.<eos> Lickety-split.<eos> "Lickety-split"?<eos> Pbbb.<eos> You better make the most of that before they chop your wiener off.<eos> Goodbye, wiener.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> The pain is gone.<eos> God has taken it away.
It knows you, it knows all your sins.<eos> Secrets.<eos> So you'll need help.<eos> - With what?<eos> - You'll have to lock me up.<eos> Go find Father Xavier.<eos> Because it is strong this thing, this terror.<eos> The terror is real, Michael.<eos> It's real.<eos> But you'll only defeat it when you believe.
You're a dick, Harv!<eos> I'm gonna have to call security if you don't get hold of yourself.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What...<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Yeah, yeah, and you're boning Nina, too, aren't you?<eos> - Did she tell you that?<eos> - She didn't have to!<eos> I still got the dildo, Harv.<eos> And I bet I could take it into a lab and get your DNA off it, too.
Sounds like a really good plan to me. To answer your question, Mr. Hicks,<eos> Gary is our transducer, which means that he can read a wide range of frequencies, including television, Wi-Fi, and cell phone transmissions...<eos> Except for Nokia.<eos> It's a different protocol.<eos> So when the call comes in, Gary will trace the signal back to its source.<eos> By scanning local antenna towers, I can create a splash grid.<eos> Oh. I'm the Cold Charlie.<eos> What?<eos> It's a way of flushing out snipers.<eos> You put your helmet on the end of your rifle, stick it out there.
Go for sports stuff.<eos> Right. Seriously, what do we do all day?<eos> We just, uh, sit around having therapy sessions?<eos> Sometimes, but most of the time we spend looking for other Alphas.<eos> When we find them?<eos> We identify them, government tracks them, and some go to the compound.<eos> The compound?<eos> - It's-<eos> - That's not its real name.<eos> She just calls it that.
But after today's hearing, if you don't object...<eos> Depends. You going for no bail?<eos> That won't change with the prosecutor.<eos> Not after what your guy did.<eos> If he didn't?<eos> Sure 'if'.<eos> Bailey picked him in her home with blood all over him.<eos> I love it when you get sarcastic.<eos> Can I at least see the arrest report?<eos> Fine! You get it from whomever takes over.
The coroner says her vagina was brutalised.<eos> Are you my lawyer, man?<eos> -I'm trying to be.<eos> Look, when I left, that chick was fine.<eos> Look, I slept with her, okay.<eos> I did, but I didn't hurt her.<eos> Three people saw you throw a knife into the LA river, huh. -Huh?<eos> Help me.<eos> -I had that knife in my car.<eos> I knew they were gonna find it, man. They were gonna pin it on me. I know!
It was terrible.<eos> So, the first thing he did afterwards, was getting himself a knife. To carry it with him at all times.<eos> Thank you, Ms. Windsor.<eos> I have no further questions, your honour.<eos> Your witness, Mr. Minton.<eos> Ms. Windsor. You seemed pretty exact about when it was your son started carrying around this... this weapon.<eos> -A five inch folding knife.<eos> -Yes, I am. The incident took place on June 9th, 2007.<eos> Was it in the newspapers?<eos> Do you somehow remember it because... the police came to talk to Louis?
But if guilty people have rights, then what about innocent people?<eos> I am innocent.<eos> I'm innocent and I want this behind me.<eos> I have no further questions, your honour.<eos> According to you... Ms. Campo... punched... herself? Or she had...<eos> Violently and visciously beat her as a part of a set up? All I know is that I didn't.<eos> And this knife that you always carry..<eos> How did she know she'd find it on you as part of the set up?<eos> Guess she couldn't. Could she?<eos> I never take it out. I never show it to anyone... So, she must have just found it in my pocket after... she or whoever knocked me out.
- Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Hey! What's that dad-gum Indian doing?<eos> I see you're consulting with the spirits.<eos> No, I'm moulting.<eos> Means I'm ready to mate.<eos> I'll keep that in mind.<eos> Cactus fruit.<eos> Yes. The ancient cactus fruit.<eos> I believe your people use it as seasoning when preparing your native dishes.
No.<eos> This is about you doing your job and me doing mine.<eos> Mine's me being left alone to manage this team you assembled for me.<eos> I didn't assemble them for you, Art.<eos> No shit.<eos> Good meeting.<eos> Every time we talk, I'm reinvigorated by my love of the game.<eos> We got Grady Fuson, former head of scouting with the Athletics.<eos> And, Grady, can you interpret for us what's going on?<eos> - They call it Moneyball.
We have a bird down.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Tango's heading northeast of our grid.<eos> We've disengaged back into a police station.<eos> We have civilians.<eos> I say again, we have civilians.<eos> Lockett, Kerns, secure this door.<eos> Nothing gets in, you understand?<eos> We got a body.<eos> Do you think you could get rid of it so the kids don't see it?
Civilians are free and clear.<eos> We were worried about your ass.<eos> I think the command-and-control asset is nearby.<eos> Kerns, how many klicks to that blackout?<eos> It's about five klicks, staff sergeant.<eos> Five klicks.<eos> All right.<eos> We're gonna use this overpass for cover.<eos> If we take out those drones our military might have a chance to get back into this fight.<eos> Santos where would you put a command and control asset if you wanted to protect it?
I'm 28 years of age, and I've never fired a pistol.<eos> Well, maybe I'll have to teach you a thing or two.<eos> I'm meeting up with a friend of mine right now, but let's meet later tonight downstairs.<eos> - You're occupied all day? - Not all day.<eos> Like I said, I'll meet you later on, by the harpist.<eos> I'll be in the wash.<eos> I'll come say good-bye before I leave.<eos> Hey.<eos> You forgot your string for your hair.<eos> I'll get it when I come back.
Okay.<eos> All right. Thank you, Doc.<eos> I haven't forgotten what you done for me, Jones. Go ahead.<eos> Get that door.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> - It's pretty, right?<eos> - That dress is expensive.<eos> It comes from New York City.<eos> I was just admiring it.
A mere story.<eos> What nonsense.<eos> Whatever brings you up here?<eos> I've been waiting to pour our tea.<eos> I'm not in need of tea, thank you.<eos> It's a quiet life, isn't it?<eos> This isolated house, a still doom for a young woman.<eos> I wish a woman could have action in her life, like a man.<eos> It agitates me to pain that the skyline over there is ever our limit.<eos> I long sometimes for a power of vision that would overpass it.
And then they moved, very quickly, mind, towards...<eos> There!<eos> That's Marteetee's land.<eos> What?<eos> Our mission may be completed sooner than I expected.<eos> If I may be so bold, Your Highness, what is the meaning of that ribbon that you hold?<eos> This?<eos> It's a gift from Belladonna.<eos> A symbol of her virgin purity.<eos> I hold it and savor it.
Yes.<eos> Wow, the Jewish neighbors must hate this.<eos> Well, Harry.<eos> Harry.<eos> You have outdone yourself.<eos> If you knew Maria's dad you'd pull out all the stops too.<eos> Has not accepted you as part of the family?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> But he's a huge fan of Christmas.<eos> I'm hoping when he sees all the work, he appreciates it.
- Okay, good.<eos> You're in charge of distracting them.<eos> How the hell do I do that?<eos> That's easy, you'll just use our secret weapon.<eos> Pillow fight in the altar boys' room.<eos> Last one there's a rotten egg.<eos> Once the coast is clear, we use the key to get into the back room.<eos> I guard while you kill the power.<eos> While everyone's trying to turn the power on you and I will get the tree.<eos> We take it to your place, and when Maria's dad comes home and sees this beautiful tree in your living room, he'll jizz all over it.
I need the situation, the anger...<eos> No, the anger is not enough.<eos> It's gotten the job done all this time.<eos> It's nearly gotten you killed all this time.<eos> Come here.<eos> Let's try something a little more challenging.<eos> My stepfather took the possibility of nuclear war quite seriously.<eos> This way.<eos> That is why he had this bunker built down here.<eos> I thought we could use it as a practice range of sorts.
It's priceless.<eos> I got it off eBay.<eos> So what was it you were looking for?<eos> Maybe I could help you.<eos> What do you do, Mr. Weiss?<eos> I'm between jobs.<eos> You like torching dogs, do ya?<eos> I saw your home movie.<eos> On YouTube, right?<eos> It got over 9,000 hits before they took it down.
Have you been practising? No.<eos> You dance much better.<eos> Where did David go?<eos> Will you help me find him?<eos> It's so cold.<eos> And to think I missed this place.<eos> But you also hated it here.<eos> Are you going to stay?<eos> When you finish the project. Will you stay?<eos> I might not finish it.
- They like that little guy.<eos> - Yeah. This whole section, coming up here,<eos> I remember it was a brainstorming session with you, Rodolphe, and Gary and Phil and me sat in a room and tried to figure out how to get, you know, the Five to be super cool in their each, individual moments.<eos> And the barges, this whole barge thing was something from the first movie that you had actually thought of for the final battle against Tai Lung, and we couldn't figure out how to do.<eos> And we actually got this barge, boat sequence to work in this one.<eos> I'm pretty sure Rodolphe came up with this, and that moment, too.<eos> "I love you guys."<eos> Yeah.<eos> Like, "Yeah, you sure you don't want this super slow-mo?"<eos> And you acted it out.
- I don't know.<eos> I looked it up and it said 50/50.<eos> But that's like the Internet, so...<eos> That's not that bad.<eos> That's better than I thought.<eos> You're gonna be fine, man.<eos> You're young.<eos> Young people beat cancer all the time.<eos> Every celebrity beats cancer.<eos> Fucking Lance Armstrong, he keeps getting it.
- Yeah, they're cute.<eos> - Yeah, let's go over.<eos> - Are they nice?<eos> - They're very nice.<eos> - They're talking to you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Really? - Take the hat off.<eos> - Take it off.<eos> Take it off.<eos> - I'm not taking it off.
- Come on.<eos> Live in the now.<eos> - I have fun with that.<eos> - I know you have fun with it.<eos> Well, you could, too, maybe. Let's do it.<eos> You're drunk.<eos> It worked.<eos> Take your hat off.<eos> - You're just gonna leave this here?<eos> - A homeless gentleman will collect it.
You gave your own father an experimental drug.<eos> I could finish your career with one phone call.<eos> I'll save you the trouble.<eos> I quit.<eos> We will proceed without you.<eos> Look, you don't know what you're doing.<eos> These tests need to be contained.<eos> You have no idea if the 113 is stable, what kind of damage it can do to people.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, that is why we test it on chimps.
And I go to her because I love her.<eos> When I have a break, I go to the bazaar and fuck.<eos> To enjoy myself.<eos> I go at least once or twice a day.<eos> It's all I think about.<eos> Without the Faridpur brothel district, women couldn't go out on the street without being molested.<eos> Men would be so horny they would rape them.<eos> Without those women, men would be screwing cows and goats.<eos> The brothel is definitely good for the area.<eos> If you take it away, the younger generation would surely suffer.
- It is not true.<eos> When he finishes school?<eos> In a month.<eos> In a month you're going to work with your uncle.<eos> It's time you learned a trade.<eos> The teacher says I have to go to middle school.<eos> That you send her children in junior high!<eos> What you gain in the end?<eos> A piece of paper, and then what?<eos> You put it in the pot and you eat it?
It's all good!<eos> Just continue eating your meals. I know him.<eos> He's a friend of mine.<eos> That looks good. What is that?<eos> You run away again, and I'll break your legs!<eos> Then I bite your ear!<eos> - What?<eos> I bite your what?<eos> - I eat your ear.<eos> I bite it off with my teeth, then you don't hear nothing.
Three thousand bucks.<eos> Is that good?<eos> It's not.<eos> We need 7,000 more.<eos> And it's almost 11:00.<eos> Hey, Noah, I have an idea.<eos> How about you start your own signature fragrance?<eos> That's a great idea!<eos> I'll just alert my team of scientists, have them invent a new perfume.<eos> We'll start selling it and we'll have seven grand in the next 45 minutes!
Menenius, you are known well enough too.<eos> I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying water in it. One that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning.<eos> What I think I utter, and spend my malice in my breath.<eos> Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.<eos> You know neither me, yourselves, nor anything.<eos> You're ambitious.<eos> Good e'en to your worships.<eos> More of your conversation would infect my brain.<eos> - How many stand for the consulship?<eos> - Three, they say, but 'tis thought of everyone Coriolanus will carry it.
We do, sir.<eos> Tell us what hath brought you to it.<eos> - Mine own desert.<eos> - Your own desert?<eos> - Aye, but not mine own desire.<eos> - How not your own desire?<eos> No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.<eos> You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.<eos> Well then, I pray, your price of the consulship?<eos> The price is to ask it kindly.
- Aye, but not mine own desire.<eos> - How not your own desire?<eos> No, it was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging.<eos> You must think, if we give you anything, we hope to gain by you.<eos> Well then, I pray, your price of the consulship?<eos> The price is to ask it kindly.<eos> Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it.<eos> I have wounds to show you, which shall be yours in private.<eos> Your good voice, sir. What say you?<eos> - You shall have it, worthy sir.
As I do know the consul's worthiness, so can I name his faults.<eos> Consul? What consul?<eos> - The Consul Coriolanus.<eos> - He, consul? It is decreed he dies tonight.<eos> He's a disease that must be cut away.<eos> O, he's a limb that hath but a disease.<eos> Mortal, to cut it off, to cure it, easy.<eos> What has he done to Rome that's worth his death, eh?<eos> Killing our enemies?<eos> The blood he hath lost, he dropped it for his country.
I would my son were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,<eos> - What then?<eos> What then? He'd make an end of thy posterity!<eos> - Bastards and all.<eos> - Come!<eos> Come, peace!<eos> Well, well, we'll leave you.<eos> Why stay we to be baited by one who wants her wits?<eos> I would the gods had nothing else to do but to confirm my curses!<eos> Could I meet them but once a day, it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to it.
How now?<eos> Aye, traitor, Martius.<eos> - "Martius"?<eos> - Aye, Martius. Caius Martius.<eos> Dost thou think I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stolen name "Coriolanus"?<eos> Perfidiously he hath betrayed your business and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city, Rome. I say "your city," for his wife and mother.<eos> Breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk. Never admitting counsel of the war, but at his nurse's tears, he whined and roared away your victory.<eos> Hear'st thou, Mars?<eos> Name not the god, thou boy of tears.<eos> Measureless liar, thou has made my heart too great for what contains it.
Hello Isak.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Simon Larsson.<eos> Ruben Lentov, pleased to meet you.<eos> So... how was school today? - Same as always.<eos> Boring.<eos> History class today was about explorers and expeditions and our teacher said that if there's anything to learn, it's from history.<eos> Ruben, is that you?<eos> I just might have a good book on explorative expeditions.<eos> I'll see if I can find it.
Where are you going?<eos> What are you laughing at?<eos> He's a retard!<eos> He just got it wrong, all right?<eos> I said Gamlestad's Square!<eos> What's going on?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Just take the phone.<eos> Put it away.<eos> Do you think we're gonna steal it?
What if others need it in English?<eos> Let's do it straight away, I mean.<eos> Do the announcement straight away?<eos> Well, now we're moving.<eos> We could have done that...<eos> The cradle will reach Göteborg.<eos> They'll have to sign for it there.<eos> They must have seen me lug the cradle around.<eos> You know, I don't think people notice things like that.<eos> Soon we'll be hearing it in German.
Shut up!<eos> He was leaving!<eos> I'm taking the clarinet.<eos> I deserve the phone, Kevin.<eos> Kevin!<eos> Hey!<eos> Are you taking the clarinet, too?<eos> The clarinet is mine.<eos> We can split it.<eos> We'll pawn it tomorrow.
No, you stop it!<eos> You're screaming like a...<eos> Let me go, mister.<eos> It's for your own good...<eos> Why should I hand over my phone?<eos> Because it's not yours.<eos> It's not your phone.<eos> It's in your best interest, can't you see that?<eos> Let me go.<eos> So, you want to take it?
We only see part of it.<eos> I was talking to some friends of ours over in Monroe County this morning, and I said something to them that I think a lot of you may have heard me say before but it bears repeating.<eos> David Norris, who has spent the last two days campaigning in the Tri-Lakes area received some welcome news yesterday when the latest New York Times poll gave him a 16-point lead over his opponent less than a month before election day.<eos> Since his announcement 11 months ago, Norris has had a significant lead ...<eos> Hi.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> I need it. Thank you.<eos> - Who should I make it out to?
Oh, I'm so gonna puke.<eos> Hey, Who's hungry'?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Anyone?<eos> I'm starving.<eos> I've never been here before.<eos> That's because the faculty club's off-limits to people like us.<eos> You mean poor people.<eos> I mean proletariat.<eos> President Sullivan did rename it the Libertarian Club in an attempt to make it more inclusive.
Nothing else matters.<eos> You're still here.<eos> l-l-I missed the plane.<eos> What about Jean ?<eos> She didn't.<eos> I had - I had quite an interesting night actually.<eos> I-I met the same, um, taxi driver, but this time I let him take me to his brother's hotel.<eos> Wh-Which turned out to be less of a hotel and more of a - more of a brothel really.<eos> And they - And they gave me this pipe, said it was apple tobacco.<eos> But that's not what they called it when I was a student.
- South.<eos> Very nice.<eos> Look, I know you got a job to do and all that.<eos> You gotta remember there are some more important things in life.<eos> You care to expand on that?<eos> Don't rock the boat, Joe.<eos> You got a nice job. Nice car. Nice home.<eos> When it comes to pushing, I'm the wrong guy you want pushing back.<eos> You threatening me?<eos> 'Cause if there's even a hint of that, badge or no badge, I will cut your fucking heart out with a rusty butter knife and eat it while it's still beating.
There is no way to switch the winner.<eos> The point on which we wished to consult with you is the best way to break the news to your father.<eos> The legal aspects are all very well, but we're talking about life and death.<eos> My father has been passed over for 20 years!<eos> Finally, when he thinks he's getting the prize...<eos> You can't take it away from him.<eos> It'll kill him.<eos> I'm not joking here.<eos> It will kill him.<eos> And he deserves it, damn it!
-Enough!<eos> This mistake shouldn't have happened, but once it did, it must be made right, not made worse.<eos> We're not discussing whether Eliezer Shkolnik is worthy of the Israel Prize.<eos> So, as chairman, what do you propose?<eos> The Minister should invite Eliezer Shkolnik, today, to apologize for the mistake.<eos> And to congratulate him upon his son receiving the prize.<eos> Pure and simple.<eos> Can you really see that happening?<eos> My father, arriving at the Minister's office, without knowing why, only to be told that they're taking the prize away from him?<eos> And what's more, that they're giving it to his son?
You have a problem with your autistic father, go yell at him, not at Josh!<eos> I told you to talk to him, not smash his head in with a bat.<eos> You have one role in this house, to be a mother.<eos> You dump that on me, too?<eos> It seems today I'm notjust the driver, but also the horse.<eos> How is it so far?<eos> Did you get reactions to the article?<eos> Some.<eos> I don't think it interested that many people.<eos> Also, they put it way in the back pages, so...
Where is he, you fucker?<eos> Never heard of him.<eos> That all you got?<eos> Yeah, Spike?<eos> We got the Welshman.<eos> We're bringing him to you now.<eos> Over.<eos> Nice work, Pennock. Well done.<eos> I'm looking forward to meeting the bastard.<eos> Hey, Spike's gonna cut your dick off and shove it in your mouth.
Did I tell you Fanny Peatrow got engaged?<eos> After she got that teller job, her mother said she was swimming in proposals.<eos> Good for fair Fanny Peatrow.<eos> Eugenia, your eggs are dying.<eos> Would it kill you to go on a date?<eos> Just show a little gumption.<eos> Careful now, careful.<eos> Oh, now look at this.<eos> This dress is just precious on you.<eos> Just take it in a little here. Little there.
- Where's the fucking case?<eos> - What case?<eos> - Get the fucking case, Kenny! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!<eos> Abu Ghraib, he can't talk if he's dead, huh?<eos> Well, if he hadn't stole it from me...<eos> He didn't steal it from you.<eos> I stole it from you.<eos> - What'd you say?<eos> - I stole it from you.<eos> And he stole it from me.
No, no, no.<eos> I don't like virgins, no.<eos> I like them good and stretched, so I can crawl right back up in there and do yoga.<eos> Well, it's different for men.<eos> We like things snug, tight.<eos> You should get bigger penises.<eos> Tight...<eos> That's why God gave us a poop shoot, Arnold.<eos> Go get a DVD, for fuck's sake.<eos> Amateurs are doing it.
Don't get no nice suntan.<eos> Raah. Moses, your jacket's gone rave.<eos> It's glowing in the UV light.<eos> Maybe it's some kind of pheromone.<eos> Maybe it's a what now?<eos> Er...it's an eco-hormone that triggers a social response in members of the same species.<eos> Maybe that's a female and the others are male, and that... that... that stuff is what's attracting them here.<eos> They're smelling us.<eos> They fell out of the sky, yeah?<eos> Well, maybe they like drift through space on... on solar winds, like spores, and...whatever planet they land on first, the female leaves a pheromone trail for the males to follow it, ind it, breed, et cetera.
[BELL TOLLING]<eos> [HORSES WHINNYING]<eos> The wolf.<eos> MAN:<eos> This way!<eos> Over here!<eos> [CROWD CHATTERING]<eos> It killed again.<eos> But we've kept the peace.<eos> Well, the wolf has broken it.
We were a very happy family.<eos> We lived in a village like this.<eos> And like Daggerhorn ours was plagued by a werewolf.<eos> One full moon, my friends and I got drunk.<eos> We decided to hunt it.<eos> It never occurred to us that we might actually find it, but find it we did.<eos> It ripped my best friend in half.<eos> Quickly.<eos> And then it was on me.<eos> I hacked and hacked at it with my axe.
Like sex.<eos> Sebastian, you are such a fucking pervert!<eos> Why don't you turn that off, and save the battery for the real stuff?<eos> - Yeah, stop filming us!<eos> - This is the real stuff.<eos> People don't care about boring old war.<eos> They need something juicy to break away from "American Idol".<eos> Like emergency sex among reporters.<eos> Anders, would you care to explain that concept to TV audiences?<eos> Why don't you explain it?
The suit was a giveaway.<eos> You're not supposed to wear black to these things anymore.<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause it's a bummer.<eos> Yeah, people like to wear bright colors these days.<eos> I don't have any bright colors.<eos> I'm not gonna tell, or whatever, about crashing the memorial.<eos> Good. Sorry for your loss.<eos> "Cast thy bread upon the waters,<eos> "for thou shalt find it after many days".
Here's that poem.<eos> "The leaves are turning, turning<eos> "Yellow, orange, red<eos> "The colors of death<eos> "Like the squirrel without its walnut, without its mother<eos> "I am alone<eos> "Like a deer that longs for running streams My soul longs for you, my God<eos> "My soul longs for you"<eos> And we must remember the words from Ecclesiastes as well.<eos> "Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after many days.
- Yeah.<eos> He's pretty amazing.<eos> What makes him so amazing?<eos> Well, they can smell carrion from miles away, which is what death smells like.<eos> So basically, a male and female will show up at the body, and kind of get to know each other.<eos> Then they work together to bury the carcass.<eos> And then they mate. And then she lays her eggs on it.<eos> But they aren't like other species, like bug species, that just run away afterwards.<eos> They make a little chamber nearby, underground.<eos> And then, when the babies hatch, the parents go chew up the corpse and feed it to them.
Later, I'll cross incalculable gulfs of space, bending time to allow for temporal journeys.<eos> The things can carry you through space?<eos> Human bodies are not suited forthe journey like theirs are.<eos> But they've solved the challenge with their surgical, mechanical, and chemical skills.<eos> Surgical?<eos> Henry, you don't mean...<eos> This is madness!<eos> No, it's true.<eos> The human body cannot make the journey, but in their care, the human mind can venture to the most distant corners of the universe.<eos> They surgically extract the brain and suspend it in a fluid-filled cylinder they have ingeniously engineered.
This is just an ATM to me.<eos> You think when I was a kid I dreamed of running a fucking chemical company?<eos> No.<eos> I dreamed of being on a beach with a model serving me tropical drinks.<eos> That's what I dreamed of.<eos> That's what's gonna happen as soon as I squeeze the profit out of this company.<eos> But first things first.<eos> You either fire the fatty or you fire the cripple, or I fire all three of you.<eos> Do the math.<eos> One loses the job or three loses it.
and before her my grandmother, and long before that my great-grandmother.<eos> I want you to wear them.<eos> There's a picture on the wall.<eos> It's painted by Figurita.<eos> A man we really liked.<eos> The best brothel dancer that ever existed.<eos> And so good-hearted, that he pitied the devil.<eos> The woman in the picture is a nun.<eos> Figurita abducted her from a monastery and married her.<eos> I leave it here, so it is the first thing you see when you wake up.
You don't think a glass of wine would have been good with this?<eos> I do think a glass of wine would have been good with it.<eos> But you wouldn't drink it?<eos> Oh, I might.<eos> Just one glass.<eos> Jesus drank wine...<eos> he and his disciples.<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> Says so right here in the Bible.<eos> Of course it don't say nothing about him hiding it in the toilet.
Why do you think there is something that I won't give up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think any man anxious to get run over by a train has got to have something on his mind.<eos> I mean most of us would just settle for maybe a slap upside the head.<eos> You say you don't care about nothing, but I don't believe that.<eos> I don't think death is ever about nothing.<eos> You asked me what I think you're holding on to and I got to say I don't know.<eos> Or maybe I just don't have the words to say it.<eos> And maybe you know but you just ain't telling.<eos> What I believe is that when you took your celebrated leap, you was taking it with you and you was holding on to it, holding on for grim death.
You don't want to see your own mama?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I want the dead to be dead forever.<eos> And I want to be one of them.<eos> Except of course you can't be one of them.<eos> You can't be one of the dead because that which has no existence can have no community.<eos> No community.<eos> My heart warms just thinking about it... blackness, aloneness, silence, peace, and all of it only a heartbeat away.<eos> I don't regard my state of mind as some pessimistic view of the world.<eos> I regard it as the world itself.
- You ain't shitting me?<eos> No, I am not shitting you.<eos> If people could see the world for what it truly is, see their lives for what they truly are, without dreams or illusions, I don't believe they could offer the first reason why they should not elect to die as soon as possible.<eos> I don't believe in God.<eos> Can you understand that?<eos> Look around you, man. Can't you see?<eos> The clamor and din of those in torment has to be the sound most pleasing to his ear.<eos> And I loathe these discussions... The argument of the village atheist whose single passion is to revile endlessly that which he denies the existence of in the first place.<eos> Your fellowship is a fellowship of pain and nothing more.<eos> And if that pain were collective instead of merely reiterative, the sheer weight of it would drag the world from the walls of the universe and send it crashing and burning down through whatever night it might yet be capable of engendering
How do you know what he wants?<eos> I mean, you're going on about him like he's a fifty foot, singing genie that you can't shove back in the bottle.<eos> No!<eos> He's Bono.<eos> He's just Paul Hewson grown up.<eos> And you need to get over it, and get yourself to-fucking-gether, so we can play this gig and steal their thunder.<eos> It's not happening.<eos> I spoke to McGuinness.<eos> The gig is off.<eos> Well, I told Bono that we'd do it.
The accident left me deaf... and I had to rule out an operatic career.<eos> You're deaf?<eos> I have to read your lips to know what you're saying.<eos> But I can still hear Wagner.<eos> I just have to close my eyes and listen.<eos> And you too are going to have to learn... to find your inner music.<eos> Everyone always goes on about sight, hearing, smell.<eos> But there's another sense.<eos> A hidden one.<eos> The Japanese call it "muga."
His first day on the job in Connemara, too.<eos> Talk about bad luck. Yeah.<eos> But, er, where do we start?<eos> I say we start with these two lads and we take it from there.<eos> Slàlnte.<eos> That's Gaelic.<eos> What's the first case you ever solved?<eos> - Stealing an ostrich.<eos> - What?<eos> Guy stole an ostrich, transported it across state lines.
Fuck.<eos> - You from the press?<eos> - Oh, God, no.<eos> - Asshole.<eos> - That's a good one now.<eos> Moody.<eos> You can use it for the cover of your book.<eos> What book?<eos> You yokes are always writing books about your fuckin' experiences.<eos> Probably sell it to the movies, then.
Sun, water and firewood are free.<eos> But salt is a commodity.<eos> The Taiping rebels are creating chaos everywhere.<eos> I am concerned about our son trading in such a faraway place.<eos> What do women know about such things?<eos> Within this household, I make all the decisions!<eos> Obey, obey, obey.<eos> He will do what he wants.<eos> My father has granted me permission to travel to Guilin to buy salt.<eos> I will return and sell it here.
Papá, what happened?<eos> The truck, they took it.<eos> Who stole the truck?<eos> I gotta find him.<eos> I gotta find him.<eos> - Papá, you calm down.<eos> - Gotta find him.<eos> Gotta find him.<eos> I have to find the truck!<eos> If I don't get it back, I'm just...
You left him when he was 10 years old.<eos> I know.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Uh, I was just gonna take a closer look.<eos> That's why we have display models.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll put it back.<eos> Here, let me do that.<eos> Hey, you haven't had a recall on this item or anything, have you?<eos> We wouldn't be selling it if there was a recall.
- Thank you so much.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> God be with you.<eos> He seems really smart, doesn't he?<eos> I guess.<eos> I think he's gonna put Ethan away.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Why didn't you give Nathan the birthday present I sent him?<eos> I was going... I didn't have a chance.<eos> Just, uh... I saw it in the closet and I wondered.
What did you give him?<eos> Made to order.<eos> Oh, best thing I ever put in my mouth.<eos> - You want some?<eos> - I don't do dick.<eos> - Hey, Ange.<eos> - Hey, Rusty.<eos> Can you take some food over to the garage for me, for Ethan?<eos> Oh, now's not really a good time. No?<eos> Okay, I'll have Rox take it over for me.
Um, he's waking up earlier now. That's great, because we have then some morning time together.<eos> 1990. Following nearly a decade of intense effort, Dr. Campbell and his colleagues finally publish their China study.<eos> It identified no less than 94,000 correlations between diet and disease.<eos> Those are big numbers for any study.<eos> And in the end of the day, when we did all these correlations in this book here, and we looked at the number of them that were statistically significant, it was between about 8,000 to 9,000.<eos> When you have that large number of correlations then you start analyzing each one, if it works out as statistically significant, this means that if 19 out of 20 are pointing in the same direction, it's highly significant<eos> and likely to be true. Hundreds of detailed tables and charts were included in the study. Each one presented the raw data that was collected.<eos> Then this information was cross-referenced in multiple ways to demonstrate its reliability and to show how it linked with the 367 variables the study examined.<eos> I think the major message we got out of all these correlation analyses is only one message. The plant food-based diet, mainly cereal grains, vegetables, and fruits, and very little animal food is always associated with lower mortality of certain cancers, stroke, and coronary heart disease.<eos> The New York times called it "the most comprehensive large study ever undertaken "of the relationship between diet and the risk of developing disease."
Bugger me worthless.<eos> I didn't think to bring gloves or something to cut the... - Ow!<eos> I thought perhaps you might need these.<eos> For the barbed wire.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I... Thanks.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That's a very long strand. And when you cut it, it's going to release this, and this, and this. And they'll coil back rather violently, which, I'm afraid, will only wound the poor fellow further.
More ammunition for our enemies.<eos> ...That all of us here in Vienna, in our psychoanalytical circle, are Jews.<eos> I don't see what difference that makes.<eos> That, if I may say so, is an exquisitely Protestant remark.<eos> I dreamed...<eos> I dreamed about a horse being hoisted by cables to a considerable height.<eos> Suddenly a cable breaks, and the horse is dashed to the ground.<eos> But it's not hurt.<eos> It leaps up and gallops away impeded only by a heavy log, which it's obliged to drag along the ground.<eos> Then a rider on a small horse appears in front of it so that it's forced to slow down.
Purchasing.<eos> Mr. Weismann.<eos> Weiss.<eos> Mike, please.<eos> Mr. Weiss, I cannot and will not look at your needle.<eos> Because of the purchasing contract that the hospital has.<eos> Will you at least look at this data?<eos> No.<eos> Would you mind telling me why?<eos> I don't want you to show me your data, and I don't want you to show this product to my nurses because they'll want it, and they can't have it.
That's for stomachs, and that stuff's more for, like, sniffling and sneezing.<eos> I know. I'm a doctor.<eos> Okay, sorry.<eos> Dude, four?<eos> They're hard to get.<eos> I hope this is a down payment.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> What about the book?<eos> - What about it?<eos> - When do I get it back?
A job and a car and a wife and an apartment!<eos> I got to go.<eos> What?<eos> - I have to go, Pat.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> You know what?<eos> You wouldn't...<eos> You would laugh at me again.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> You see a fucking truck with the word "Kevin" on it and you have to run after it?
"Gone with the Wind."<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> You can't get all upset<eos> -over a fish. -No.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> You want that fish?<eos> -Do you really want it...?<eos> -No.<eos> -You want that fish?<eos> -I don't want it.
Don't worry about it.<eos> You can't get all upset<eos> -over a fish. -No.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> You want that fish?<eos> -Do you really want it...?<eos> -No.<eos> -You want that fish?<eos> -I don't want it.<eos> If you really want it, I'II get it for you.
He can't get on the train, all right?<eos> How 'bout you finish telling me how your boyfriend ended up down that mine?<eos> Where you going?<eos> I need a drink.<eos> ...You better escort me to my room, make sure I fall asleep on the right side of the door.<eos> So I accommodated the lady.<eos> Of course she didn't sleep much.<eos> Just keep walking.<eos> Well, I'll be fucked.<eos> Yeah, your horoscope for the day, I read it too.
Look at all these side menus here for data entry.<eos> Let's check this one.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Same building, same order every week.<eos> It's a delivery schedule.<eos> What's this?<eos> Drugs?<eos> No.<eos> That's a dealer pack.<eos> See, most major players, they weigh their money so they don't have to constantly count it.
Hi Pirkko.<eos> I'd like to ask you a couple of questions - about your friend Kerttu.<eos> Best Regards, Jussi Vares.<eos> Guess who?<eos> Get dressed, and we'll hit the city.<eos> Did you get the money?<eos> - I will soon.<eos> What's that?<eos> - That will guarantee I get my money.<eos> Touch it, and I'll kill you.
- What?<eos> A job.<eos> What job?<eos> Just to sit down for six hours without doing anything.<eos> Is that all?<eos> That's all.<eos> It's not bad for a writer, is it?<eos> Tea.<eos> The code is B842.<eos> Learn it by heart, B842.
See look at it, what is its? first impression of Adriana?<eos> It is very charming.<eos> He sees it. It has no more output OK.<eos> It is implicit.<eos> Miss Stein, of course. It is why it has lost all objectivity.<eos> He has painted a being from the Place Pigalle A whore of volcanic appetites.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> But if you know...<eos> Yes, but if your lover, But if we do not know.<eos> You make a trial of small bourgeois, turning it into object of pleasure.
See, I did--listen.<eos> I didn't. No, no, no.<eos> I didn't say fat.<eos> She said fat.<eos> I--I said--I said perspective.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I can't believe you just called mom a blimp.<eos> No, I never said, "mom," and, "blimp," in the same sentence.<eos> I--I-- you know--you know, auntie Sheila's right, ok?<eos> Uncle Jimmy, he deserves to be on that TV show, and he's gonna be on that TV show, because he was a hero, and everybody's gonna watch it, and everybody's gonna see it, and they're gonna see what a hero he was.
Exactly.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What's wrong now?<eos> Man, I knew somethin' was gonna get screwed up.<eos> Lou is supposed to be takin' his own mental evaluation.<eos> Ok.<eos> Well, who's doin' it?
Wait a sec...<eos> You want me to get our boss' boss out of a club and bring him back to the office at 10:00 on a Thursday night?<eos> Well, our boss got axed, so technically he is our boss, and yes, that is what I want you to do.<eos> - Why?<eos> Look, man. Just trust me, okay?<eos> I need you guys back here now.<eos> All right. We'll be there in 10.<eos> Have I ever told you how much I love your bag?<eos> No, really.<eos> - Do you have a little dress that matches it? - Yeah, I do.
- Gotten too comfortable.<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> I said I could open an investigation.<eos> Say what you mean.<eos> Mr. Palmer called me into a meeting today.<eos> The war against the Bolsheviks has begun. He's insisted that I lead a new anti-radical division.<eos> Did you leap like a dog?<eos> I told him this is the greatest threat our nation has ever faced and I cannot take the job unless I feel certain I can be effective.<eos> Well done.<eos> But you'll take it.
- Hello, Mrs. Ellis.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Imagine!<eos> They've sent my son to Norway for a whole year.<eos> I'll be right up.<eos> So he asked me to keep his things here for him.<eos> But I've got such a small cellar, and I thought, since I have all that stuff down there, maybe you...<eos> Of course, Mrs. Ellis.<eos> I don't need all that space.<eos> When would you need it?
Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn.<eos> For Gatsby turned out all right in the end.<eos> It was what preyed on him, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams.<eos> At least once a fortnight, a corps of caterers came with several hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby's gardens.<eos> There was music from my neighbour's house through those summer nights.<eos> In his enchanted gardens, men and girls came and went like moths, among the whispering and the champagne and the stars.<eos> I believe few people were actually invited to these parties, they just went.<eos> They got into automobiles which bore them to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door, come for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own admission ticket.<eos> After that, they conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated with an amusement park.<eos> About half way between the two Eggs and New York, the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it a short distance, presided over by the eyes of Doctor T J Eckleburg, set there by some wild wag of an oculist to fatten his practice in Queens.
Yes, I am. And he forgot his.<eos> Reagan.<eos> Bring out my hydrovac suit.<eos> Right this minute.<eos> Here's your silly old hydrovac suit.<eos> Jesus, I could hardly find it. It's such a mess in that bedroom.<eos> What am I gonna do with a hydrovac suit?<eos> If you don't want the police to recognise you, take off that robot uniform.<eos> - What is a hydrovac suit? - It's for space travel.<eos> Use it as a disguise.
And thank you!<eos> I think it's going to work out.<eos> I think my wife will come back.<eos> Fuchs is such a jerk!<eos> I'd like to say goodbye to you.<eos> We can't just part.<eos> I want to say goodbye.<eos> You were so nice to me.<eos> I have a little surprise for you.<eos> It's not much, but I think you'll like it.
they are normal: Without infamies e without louvores.<eos> Me it does not seem that it has?<eos> let us say, the vocation for education.<eos> It is probable.<eos> Today, the 2 secondary school?<eos> it is in strike. This is? to another face of the freedom, let us say thus.<eos> It comes! I go to show the school to it.<eos> Here it is!<eos> This is its room.<eos> I do not say more to it nothing? therefore I want that it has a personal opinion.
I won't return to earth.<eos> We'll live here, on the station.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> The ocean's activity is increasing. Your encephalogram may be the cause.<eos> Whenever we show pity we empty our souls.<eos> Perhaps that's true.<eos> Suffering makes life seem gray and suspicious.<eos> No, I don't believe that...<eos> I will not accept that...<eos> What is not indispensable to life is in some way harmful to it?
You're wasting your time, you know.<eos> I can stand a great deal of this childishness.<eos> This is only the beginning.<eos> We have other methods.<eos> Yes, I'm sure you have.<eos> But it won't do you any good.<eos> You'll talk, eventually.<eos> Everybody talks.<eos> How can I give you information that doesn't exist?<eos> BRIGADE LEADER: The information must exist and you will give it to us!
Better call an ambulance.<eos> - 5251, Chicago.<eos> - 5251.<eos> Better send an ambulance out to the Eisenhower... in front of the Kedzie turnoff.<eos> We got a wreck.<eos> We got coverage.<eos> We'll send it in with the bike man.
I just strangled her<eos> Mm-hmm And then what happened?<eos> Like I said, I began taking things:<eos> the silverware, a couple of candle holders, a couple of lighters and the jewelry<eos> Did you take any money, Tommy?<eos> Yeah She had about 3O bucks in her purse<eos> What did you do with the stuff that you stole?<eos> I fenced it Where?<eos> Why should I get him in trouble?<eos> What did he give you for it?
- You need any money?<eos> Nope.<eos> What do you do with this stuff?<eos> It's for a friend.<eos> Hey! How'd it go?<eos> Okay.<eos> - I brought you something.<eos> - Oh, thanks.<eos> Aw, the poor thing.<eos> I'll find a good spot for it.
- You think they are all-?<eos> - Undoubtedly!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - You should never have come here.<eos> - So why did we come?<eos> - Ask the professor.<eos> Oh, so you're here.<eos> You're here. If you have no objection, I'm not hibernating.<eos> - You don't seem very pleased.<eos> - I am surprised. Keep your surprise for later on, you'll need it.
I always suspected you discovered its secret but I had no idea you were trying to destroy it.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Because power is a curse.<eos> Because you think you're in control and it becomes unmanageable.<eos> It's leading you and you become its victim.<eos> Don't you realize that you can't burn the Golem out of existence?<eos> Oh, yes, yes, yes.<eos> I realize that now, but I couldn't have, not at the time.<eos> Not when I traced that inscription, I couldn't have fully believed it.
I see you are busy? I am.<eos> Well, are you back from work or going to work?<eos> is that old stuff worth the trouble?<eos> I like to put things together.<eos> Selling buttons isn't a man's job.<eos> Tony!<eos> Has someone been calling me?<eos> I have to. Uncle, your cigarette.<eos> You finish it.<eos> What do you need it for?
No.<eos> Why?<eos> You're a foreigner.<eos> You've got lost.<eos> You have just arrived in the legendary land of Turkey<eos> Mosques, castles, secret gardens, haremsE<eos> Just like in the books!<eos> And today you are going to visit the White Palace of Beykoy<eos> No, Beykoy is where I live<eos> A large empty house by the water's edge, with trees overhanging it.
You have to turn the handle.<eos> So.<eos> There's a record.<eos> Careful, it's new.<eos> So, how are you?<eos> - Well, what about you?<eos> - Like an old man now.<eos> Did you buy that stuff?<eos> These are all things I need on my island.<eos> And you exchanged it for nacre like these?
Yes, sir.<eos> I got a little grease in this lining.<eos> It'll take a half-hour to check it.
You see? You'll be well protected.<eos> Miss Edna Grüberg.<eos> Mr. Dormeuil.<eos> Delighted.<eos> Some port to refresh you after the drive?<eos> No, thank you, sir. I don't want to stay too long.<eos> Come now, there's no hurry.<eos> I'll show you your room.<eos> It looks out over the trees.<eos> I'm sure you'll like it.
It's just that simple.<eos> In the meantime, do we still take George Company off at 1500?<eos> Yes, Carl.<eos> The order stands.<eos> We may lose the hill, but I'm not about to spend any more men for it.<eos> Not until I'm assured we don't intend to give it away tomorrow.<eos> I'll... take your wounded down with me.<eos> Joe, uh... You know when you said to me that this damn hill was worth holding'?<eos> I think I know what you meant.<eos> They say that nothing's got a value, except the value that men put on it.
I am not, not anymore!<eos> - Why?<eos> I've been fired because of you!<eos> What did I do?<eos> When you were the director you said you didn't like me... and you wrote my dismissal letter.<eos> And the new director signed it.<eos> I forgot!<eos> But they gave you the bonus.<eos> I signed that!<eos> Because it was signed by you, I didn't get it.
I can't remember.<eos> Major.<eos> You think it's anything got to do with that smack I got on the head?<eos> Funny, I'm always getting hit in the same place.<eos> Right on the head.<eos> I remember when I was a kid.<eos> I was just a...<eos> My old man gave me a whipping.<eos> He took the belly band off some harness and...<eos> Boy, did he give it to me.

- A stimulant from the medical safe.<eos> It's 100 proof, sir.<eos> - How long have I been out?<eos> - Just a few minutes, Captain.<eos> You'd better worry about yourself.<eos> You'll be in for a rough time.<eos> Hendrix knows his stuff.<eos> You've had a pretty bad concussion.<eos> It's worse than that.<eos> There's a medical term for it, but it all adds up to blacking out now and then for quite a while.
I don't mind confessing to you I have been worried about him.<eos> Sometimes I'm frightened.<eos> Why?<eos> That life will present a bill to Nicolo one day, and he will find it hard to pay.<eos> But when I see you with him, I feel better.<eos> Me?<eos> You do?<eos> Yes, you.<eos> I wish I could share your confidence.<eos> You will have it when you need it.
If you should say to me, "What question?" I would tell you.<eos> What question?<eos> We'll try it again.<eos> Should Bunny Watson marry Mike Cutler?<eos> Question mark.<eos> Oh, wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said this machine can't evaluate.<eos> Can't.<eos> Can't.<eos> It can only repeat information fed into it by the human elements.
The ashtrays were all full.<eos> That girl I was with the other night, she gave you a letter to mail.<eos> Do you happen to know who it was addressed to?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I just wanted to know who the lucky guy was.<eos> It was addressed to some joker named Mike.<eos> Mike?<eos> Interesting letter, huh?<eos> Good evening, Mr. Hammer.<eos> We took a gander at it.
Well, I'll try to explain it to you.<eos> Sometimes a species gets isolated in time.<eos> If the conditions are right, it reproduces itself without change... skipping a chapter of evolution.<eos> Way back, there must have been some major link... between marine and terrestrial life.<eos> It's just possible that this is it.<eos> Well, that's all there is to it.<eos> Now I tell you what I believe.<eos> This beast exists because it is stronger than... than the thing that you call evolution.<eos> In it is some force of life.<eos> A demon... driving it through millions of centuries.
You knew they'd burn the ranch, and yet you had us pull out?<eos> That's right.<eos> Wilkison controls the law here.<eos> You give him any excuse, he'll have us declared outlaws.<eos> Nobody can blame us for what we do to night riders burning our ranch.<eos> How do you know they'll come this way?<eos> They'll think we abandoned it. They'll be off guard.<eos> They're bound to take the shortest way home.<eos> It's a funny thing, when you work a place, you sort of become part of it.<eos> You feel for the land, everything that happens to it.
Methought that I had broken from the Tower... and was embarked to cross to Burgundy. And in my company, my brother Gloucester... who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches.<eos> Thence we looked towards England... and cited up a thousand fearful times... during the wars of York and Lancaster that had befallen us.<eos> As we paced along upon the giddy footing of the hatches... methought that Gloucester stumbled... and, in falling... struck me, that thought to stay him... overboard, into the tumbling billows of the main.<eos> Lord, Lord!<eos> Methought what pain it was to drown.<eos> What dreadful noise of water in mine ears.<eos> What ugly sights of death within mine eyes.<eos> Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks... 10,000 men that fishes gnawed upon... wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl... inestimable stones, unvalued jewels... all scattered at the bottom of the sea.<eos> Had you such leisure in the time of death... to gaze upon the secrets of the deep?<eos> Methought I had, and often did I strive... to yield the ghost. But still the envious flood kept in my soul... and would not let it forth to find the empty, vast and wandering air... but smothered it within my panting bulk... which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
I mean, isn't everybody a part of everybody else?<eos> And you really believe that drool?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Here we are.<eos> One for the lady and for the gent.<eos> Here's to the first one, I hope it ain't the last.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> No, not like that. One hum.<eos> Do you want to hear my philosophy of life?<eos> Do it to him before he does it to you.
On your knees!<eos> Scrub the floor!<eos> - Who was the set designer on this?<eos> - Cary Odell.<eos> Hello, kid.<eos> What are you doing out here all by yourself?<eos> - I'm gonna get a little drink.<eos> - Sit down. I got a bottle.<eos> Thanks, Top.<eos> I gotta hand it to you, kid, the way you beat up old Galovitch this afternoon.
- Good night.<eos> Mom?<eos> Why would he wanna be left alone?<eos> Don't forget to brush your teeth.<eos> - Bobby, have you a flashlight?<eos> - it's a real Boy Scout one.<eos> - Fine.<eos> Here.<eos> All you gotta do is push up on it.<eos> - What do you need it for?
How can I give such news to the führer?<eos> You've reported misfortune to him before.<eos> Why should this one present such a problem?<eos> But that's just it. We've had nothing but bad news for weeks.<eos> Isn't there any good news I can give him at the same time?<eos> Have you checked on the Russian Front this morning?<eos> We're not discussing the Russian Front. We're discussing yours.<eos> This situation in the West becomes worse with every report. L<eos> - I'm actually embarrassed to give him another disappointment like this.<eos> Can't you think of anything we can do about it? Certainly.
- Oh, now, wait a minute.<eos> - Come on, come on.<eos> Well, he's in her dressing room, but, please, don't make any trouble.<eos> Oh, sure, sure.<eos> You know, that's real funny.<eos> - Yeah. - What?<eos> Oh, Joe, act your age.<eos> - I don't believe it.<eos> Is this your car?<eos> - Yeah, what about it, flatfoot?
Laurie!<eos> Laurie, don't.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get in!<eos> - You were gonna kill that man.<eos> - He'd have killed us if he'd had the chance.<eos> They're gaining on us.<eos> Go on, faster.<eos> I can't get this thing any faster.<eos> What's the matter with it?
He said that I condemned by abduction.<eos> Certainly.<eos> Let the fight and the store. You open the door and serve the port.<eos> gives them their ballots for provisional freedom.<eos> the return to the and send us more.<eos> Me take care of them.<eos> good night. I have not bothered.<eos> good night. the grid but not touched, so I gave back.<eos> It is strange.<eos> Delighted to see you. Pass the restaurant, if not download it.
Make arrow point.<eos> Looks like the little arrow only hears the white man's tongue.<eos> Point at fire.<eos> Little arrow, do not listen to Sioto's medicine.<eos> Point at fire.<eos> Looks like you're not doing so well.<eos> Oh, Chris.<eos> Sioto say not magic.<eos> Arrow point all time at tree.<eos> It points where I tell it to.
Grown up a bit, haven't you?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Come into the laboratory.<eos> Sit down, please.<eos> Now, let's look at that hand.<eos> Mm, nasty.<eos> - Might lead to tetanus. - Tetanus?<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Lockjaw, then.<eos> I'll clean it with a strong disinfectant.
Judge StiIIman will hear about this.<eos> He'II know how to handle things.<eos> Nice work, Oex.<eos> helen!<eos> Wanted to see a gold mine, eh?<eos> - What was all the shooting?<eos> Just Oex's way of informing lawyers they can't serve papers here.<eos> You mean a court order?<eos> -Yeah, that's what they call it.<eos> We've got a different name for it.
It's obviously a forgery.<eos> In that case, there would be no objection... ... ifmyfrienddeliveredtheletter to the public prosecutor?<eos> No, none at all.<eos> But, Mr. Joyce...<eos> ... frommystudyofthecase, Ibelieve that if my friend could be induced... ... todelivertheletterinto ourhands , it would save-- lt would save a great deal of trouble.<eos> Under what circumstance would your friend... ... be" induced"to partwiththeletter?<eos> But my friend does not have the letter.<eos> The woman has it.<eos> She did not know its value until my friend told her.<eos> What value did he put on it?
Tell that shyster to shut up or you'll go to the Hall of Justice.<eos> - On what charges?<eos> - Witnesses.<eos> They ask them questions.<eos> Your clients spend nine-tenths of the time doing it.<eos> Take these down and check them with the bullet that killed Landis.<eos> - Hold it a minute.<eos> You. You got a gun?<eos> - No.<eos> What did you do with it?
It was on a redouble.<eos> - They play a lot of bridge in Bangkok?<eos> - Great bridge town. We call it Bridgeport.<eos> No, you're really very fortunate moving in with our crowd.<eos> Only last week, JB - JB Bradley, I mean - said to me, "Dick." Calls me Dick for short.<eos> "Dick," he said, "I'm sure your missis is gonna like it here."<eos> - You will, too.<eos> - Oh, I know I will.<eos> - Tell her about the house, Richard.<eos> - Oh, yes. But just a description of it doesn't do it justice.
Can I tell you something personal?<eos> It's up to you.<eos> Can I tell you something personal?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you gotta go first.<eos> Okay.<eos> I think that...<eos> I think that sex is overrated.<eos> I think that people place far too much importance on it.
I need it<eos> Good luck<eos> Can I speak with the "boss"?<eos> I came to wish you happy holidays and...<eos> The paper gives "spumante" and cake to everyone ...I didn't receive anything for Christmas<eos> Maybe your name wasn't on the list, maybe it's a mistake<eos> You didn't get anything last year, right?<eos> - Did you read my article?<eos> - No.<eos> - Take a look at it
And now they say we must fight them.<eos> I miss you, my wife, my children.<eos> And my heart hungers for news of you.<eos> New China Radio reports that fighting between Vietnam and Democratic Kampuchea has broken out on a number of fronts.<eos> This is in retaliation, according to the Vietnamese for a number of attacks on border villages...<eos> Taxi driver, huh?<eos> I think you speak English.<eos> Sit down.<eos> You know, I love this country.<eos> I sacrificed everything for it.
Then good ol' Gus contacts the Vulcan satellite.<eos> Ol' Gus has been doing some thinking.<eos> That's why I keep you around.<eos> I've been thinking that I'm not making enough money for this gig.<eos> Gus, if there's anything I hate it's greed.<eos> Greed?<eos> Mr. Ross, just a minute.<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> I can't ski!<eos> Once Gus contacts the Vulcan satellite he orders it to search through space around where Krypton went bye-bye.
Awake!<eos> Light!<eos> Bright torches!<eos> We bring the spoils of the hunt<eos> Arise, Gutrune!<eos> Greet Siegfried!<eos> The mighty hero is coming home<eos> What has happened, Ha gen?<eos> I did not hear his horn!<eos> The pallid hero can blow it no more
But I'll tell you something else.<eos> You must write this down so that people remember.<eos> So they don't forget.<eos> How they treated those poor dead people!<eos> After all, a dead person is sacred!<eos> There were so many of them!<eos> I was looking for Mateusz.<eos> All we could see were their feet, with these name tags... tied to their toes.<eos> I recognized Mateusz by his smashed toe.<eos> A beam had fallen on it once.
They've got enough revolutionaries.<eos> But if you wanted worldwide press coverage... New York. Where else?<eos> What about the possibility that he could have retired or gone into hiding?<eos> Sergeant Fox, isn't it?<eos> The answer to the possibility of Wulfgar's retirement, sir, is... he's only beginning.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> In 72 hours, I want each of you to know every detail of his past operations.<eos> We must make use of every bit of time we have.<eos> I assure you Wulfgar isn't wasting his.<eos> International terrorism, gentlemen, is a worldwide organization... and the man who runs like a thread through the majority of all of it is one... alias Wulfgar.
Remember how it was before Helen?<eos> When Siegfried had to deal with the chronic bad payers.<eos> Screaming fits, howling rage...<eos> mental breakdowns.<eos> Every practice has bad debts.<eos> Siegfried's just discovered the same ones up to their tricks again, despite his PNS system.<eos> - PNS?<eos> You know, his system of letters.<eos> Personal, nasty, solicitor's.<eos> The really hard cases never pay any attention to it anyway.
He talks just like that.<eos> We'll be ready.<eos> Sunset, then.<eos> And a bird will fight for us.<eos> - A bird?<eos> - Even Woundwort won't expect that.<eos> Bigwig!<eos> That white bird you were talking to this morning...<eos> - Talking to, sir?<eos> - You were very close to it. Why?
That's how that poor woman is.<eos> She might have dropped it into the pot.<eos> No, that's not true, I'm sure.<eos> Berta couldn't take it off.<eos> When?<eos> When did it happen?<eos> That eveving at your party.<eos> But maybe that's not her ring.<eos> - We may be mistaken.<eos> It's one which looks like it.
To the degree that necessity is socially dreamed, the dream becomes necessary.<eos> The spectacle is the bad dream of enchained modern society, which ultimately expresses only its desire to sleep.<eos> The spectacle is the guardian of this sleep.<eos> The fact that the practical power of modern society... has broken off of its own accord... and established an independent realm in the spectacle... can only be explained by this additional fact... that practical power continued to lack cohesion, and had remained in contradiction with itself.<eos> The oldest social specialization, the specialization of power, is at the root of the spectacle.<eos> The spectacle is thus... a specialized activity which speaks for the ensemble of the others.<eos> It is the diplomatic representation of hierarchical society to itself, where every other form of speech is banned.<eos> The most modern is here the most archaic as well.<eos> The generalized split of the spectacle... is inseparable from the modern State, that is to say, from the general form of the split in society, product of the division of social labor... and agent of class domination.<eos> In the spectacle, one part of the world represents itself to the world, and is superior to it.
It reveals too late its essential poverty, that is tied to the poverty of its production.<eos> But already, there's another object that carries the justification of the system... ant the requirement of being recognized.<eos> The imposture of satisfaction... must denounce itself in replacing itself, in following the change of products... and those of the general conditions of production.<eos> What affirmed with the most perfect impudence... its own definitive excellence changes, however, in the diffuse spectacle- though it does so as well in the concentrated spectacle- ant it's the system alone which must continue:<eos> Stalin, as well as the outmoded commodity, are denounced by the same ones who imposed them.<eos> Each new lie in advertising... is also the admission of the preceding lie.<eos> Each collapse of a figure of totalitarian power... reveals the illusory community... that unanimously approved it, and which was only an agglomeration of solitudes... without illusions.<eos> What the spectacle presents as perpetual... is founded upon change, and must change with its base.<eos> The spectacle is absolutely dogmatic, and at the same time, can lead to no solid dogma.<eos> Nothing stops for it, this is the state most natural to it... and yet the most contrary to its inclination.
and what we call the last, is it anything, properly understood, but a redoubling, and the final attack, as it were, of the evil... that we bring into the world in being born?<eos> Capitalist production has unified space, which is no longer limited by external societies.<eos> This unification is at the same time an extensive and intensive... process of banalization.<eos> Just as the accumulation of commodities mass produced... for the abstract space... of the market was to break down... all regional and legal barriers, and all of the corporate restrictions of the middle ages... which maintained the quality of artisanal production- it was also to dissolve the autonomy... and the quality of places.<eos> This power of homogenization... is the heavy artillery... that brought down all the walls of China.<eos> It is in order to become ever more identical with itself, to better approach motionless monotony... that the free space of the commodity... is henceforth constantly modified and reconstructed.<eos> This society that suppresses geographical distance... gathers distance internally, as spectacular separation.<eos> By product of the circulation of commodities, human circulation considered as a form of consumption, tourism reduces fundamentally to the leisure of going to see... what has become banal.<eos> The economic management of the frequentation of different places... is already by itself the guarantee of their equivalence.<eos> The same modernization that withdrew time from travel... withdrew from it as well the reality of space.
Demons can disguise it, as a bird or a snake, but not that.<eos> If it becomes a bird, how can we catch it?<eos> Can we shoot?<eos> If it's a bird and you shoot it, it becomes gold and falls.<eos> Good, We must be prepared and keep the gun with us.<eos> - Any news?<eos> - Cabbar scares me.<eos> He found a stone and thought it was the treasure.<eos> He has his gun.<eos> If treasure is a bird, he'll shoot it.
Did you get the number?<eos> Look right here.<eos> I must know the truth.<eos> It's very important for me.<eos> This is him... and you can see the cup too.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He didn't fight in these parts.<eos> He used come to talk; he said he needed it for a film.
I wanted to look you over, ask a question.<eos> Look quick.<eos> I killed so many men these past four years, one more don't matter.<eos> You passed up your chance.<eos> You think I'm gonna pass up mine?<eos> Truce for tonight.<eos> Then you believe them when they say I'm crazy?<eos> So am I, but it's a funny thing.<eos> A man crazy to live takes a chance and dies.<eos> A man who doesn't care takes the same chance and gets away with it.
- Next event is the Brahma bull riding. - Oh.<eos> That's me.<eos> - No, not yet.<eos> You got a couple of minutes.<eos> - What for?<eos> - He's got a bull to ride.<eos> Walk around a bit.<eos> - Guido, he's not going in there again?<eos> - I guess he wants to ride that bull.<eos> Just let him walk it off, Roz.
He is still a dog.<eos> Let the women in judgement come forward.<eos> Never before has an alien sat beside our king in judgement.<eos> Her presence profanes all Israel.<eos> Who makes complaint?<eos> My Lord King, this woman Leah and I dwell within the same house.<eos> I was delivered of a child.<eos> On the third day after I was delivered, she was delivered also.<eos> There was no one in the house but we two.<eos> In the night, this woman's child died because she lay upon it, wherefore she removed my son from beside me while I slept and laid her dead child against my bosom.
You'll find some in the kitchen.<eos> He doesn't believe me, Beck.<eos> He will.<eos> Somebody's playing games!<eos> Rough ones.<eos> There's a blood spot.<eos> What you saw was the body of a murdered man.<eos> Did you examine it carefully?<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't know what's happened to it.
-You wait.<eos> You are pleased to recite proverb you learn yesterday and writing down 1 2 times in copybook.<eos> "A thought for the day:<eos> East or west home is best."<eos> "East, west, home, best," means house!<eos> "A man's house is only less dear to him than his honor."<eos> Every day, month after week, something about house.<eos> Are my children to be taught nothing more?<eos> Yesterday we are taught that the world is a round ball which spins on an invisible stick through its middle.<eos> Everyone knows the world rides on the back of a turtle who keeps it from running into the stars.
From his looks, he didn't appear to be the kind that was "too good."<eos> Well, he was.<eos> Horribly good.<eos> I like your mouth, too.<eos> Especially when you say "good."<eos> - Will you have some more lemonade?<eos> - Maybe later. Thanks.<eos> Where'd Arnie get the rabbit?<eos> He found it.<eos> I think Captain Wiles shot it.
Out with it, speak!<eos> What is it?<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> A child?<eos> Maricchia!<eos> Stay here.<eos> In 15 minutes, I'm done!<eos> We'll go home together.<eos> This calls for a toast, right?<eos> What shall we name it?
I'm the English colonel that got their captain and Carstairs killed.<eos> The officer that's whipped them in and out of these caves for the last nine months.<eos> - They'd rather see me dead than Rommel.<eos> - No, Tammy.<eos> You don't understand men yet.<eos> I don't say they love you, but they do know you.<eos> You're authority to them.<eos> The general, why, he's just a name.<eos> You're the one that's running their war.<eos> If you give the order, they won't like it, but they're just stubborn enough to follow it.
Then a storm came up, so suddenly.<eos> We saw a house across the field and ran for shelter.<eos> The house was closed.<eos> I don't know what time it was,<eos> but it was late.<eos> We had missed the last ferry back from the island.<eos> There was no way I could get in touch with my husband.<eos> It stopped raining in the morning.<eos> A man came walking down through the garden.<eos> He walked as though he owned it.
- My goodness, I'm so happy.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> The idiot!<eos> It's still my name and my château.<eos> It's like you're marrying me, I'm so happy!<eos> You're always happy!<eos> It's horrible!<eos> Careful, Miquette!<eos> "At the foot of this wall, the sea is dark and deep.<eos> It takes good care of the secrets that we entrust it with.
Well, of course I did.<eos> If I said I did, I did.<eos> Then perhaps you'll have the goodness to explain how this fell out of your jewel box.<eos> - What's so funny?<eos> - You.<eos> You're jealous!<eos> If you were so crazy for him, why didn't you marry him? - Because I wasn't in love with him.<eos> - That's not what you said in your diary.<eos> Now you've been reading my diary!<eos> It just happened to fall open. And I happened to look at it. - It just happened.
Go to the king... if you like.<eos> Mem...<eos> Do not make quarrel with new favourite of the king.<eos> You will lose. Tuptim...?<eos> Let's get on with our work now, please.<eos> We've lost enough time.<eos> Mem, there is thing in this book I do not believe.<eos> What is it, Prince Chulalongkorn?<eos> It shows world like round ball that spins on stick through middle.<eos> And everyone knows that world rest on back of great turtle, who keeps it from running into stars.
Let me help you.<eos> - Go back!<eos> Let me go with you.<eos> I want to help. - Then go back!<eos> Kiss me.<eos> You're shameless.<eos> - Yes.<eos> What's happened to that Gypsy?<eos> - I saw him coming down.<eos> Then he saw a rabbit and went after it.
I do like a man who tells you right out he's lookin' out for himself.<eos> Don't we all?<eos> I don't trust a man who says he's not.<eos> Now, let's talk about the black bird.<eos> Mr. Spade, have you any conception of how much money can be got for that black bird?<eos> Well, sir, if I told you, if I told you half, you'd call me a liar.<eos> No, not even if I thought so.<eos> But you tell me what it is, and I'll figure out the profit.<eos> You mean, you don't know what that bird is?<eos> I know what it's supposed to look like and I know the value in human life you people put on it.
Go to bed.<eos> What's the game? What are you up to?<eos> Will you kindly remember that you're not a guest in this house?<eos> All right.<eos> Bella, I have your dog here.<eos> I found it in the drawing room where you know it is not allowed.<eos> Don't, Paul, no!<eos> Don't hurt it, I'm coming!<eos> Give me the dog.<eos> What have you done with it?
It's called Maggie!<eos> You like ? - It is graceful.<eos> - Only graceful?<eos> A small and beautiful beast.<eos> If you do not have eyes that....<eos> What had Maggie's eyes?<eos> They're too close.<eos> Symptom greed. You should know her. It is the most selfless girl in the world.<eos> - To understand her you love her more.<eos> - Very much. So much that you can not imagine life without it.
30... 31?<eos> 35?<eos> 37?<eos> 39?<eos> Did you know that Arsene Lupin had stolen the crown at 17 Queen Irina Petrova?<eos> Tell me! Do you have a girlfriend ?<eos> Do you have it or not ?<eos> Have completed...<eos> You have no girlfriend.<eos> Have you left it or you left it?
You don't have to blame yourself.<eos> What's wrong with her?<eos> She's got gangrene. On her fingers and toes.<eos> -Do you know what it is?<eos> -Sort of.<eos> Well, it's sometimes called "mortification". And what that means is that that part of the body is dead because the blood isn't getting through.<eos> And you think she might have got that from a wee cut?<eos> I know next to nothing about medicine, Eagle.<eos> Mrs Butterworth knows more than me. She was a nurse once.<eos> -So what can you do about it?
How would you like it: In coins or notes?<eos> It was worth a try.<eos> I was just asking.<eos> Hello!<eos> Trying your luck again?<eos> Yeah, same as every week.<eos> But with one difference.<eos> This is my lucky week.<eos> What would we be without hope?<eos> Come off it! You live from it!
I'm calling the police.<eos> I am the police.<eos> What?<eos> The cop that lives upstairs?<eos> What's that?<eos> Plastic explosive.<eos> A bomb?<eos> That's right.<eos> If you'd bothered me any more, we'd all be stuck to the ceiling.<eos> - Do you want to hold it?
What attracted my grandfather to the island, apart from the profuse source of wiry labour that it promised, was the unique combination of volcanic soil and the warm Gulf Stream that surrounded it.<eos> You see, his experiments had led him to believe that it was possible to induce here the successful growth of certain new strains of fruit that he had developed.<eos> So, with typical mid-Victorian zeal, he set to work.<eos> The best way of accomplishing this, so it seemed to him, was to rouse the people from their apathy by giving them back their joyous old gods, and as a result of this worship, the barren island would burgeon and bring forth fruit in great abundance.<eos> What he did, of course, was to develop new cultivars of hardy fruits suited to local conditions.<eos> But, of course, to begin with, they worked for him because he fed them and clothed them, but later, when the trees starting fruiting, it became a very different matter.<eos> And the ministers fled the island, never to return.<eos> What my grandfather had started out of expediency, my father continued out of...<eos> He brought me up the same way, to reverence the music and the drama and the rituals of the old gods.<eos> To love nature and to fear it, and to rely on it and to appease it where necessary.
Won't be much to do in town with the picture show closed.<eos> Well, so long.<eos> Duane.<eos> You watch out now, overseas.<eos> Sure weren't no women around.<eos> I guess the next piece of ass I get will be yellow.<eos> I wish I was going with you.<eos> Take care of the car for me.<eos> Your ma don't need it?<eos> I wouldn't want her driving it, the way she drives.
You raise him.<eos> Bring him up with the gentleness that your daughter had.<eos> Captain?<eos> Fogarty.<eos> It's the men, sir.<eos> I thought maybe you'd be interested in knowing what some of them's been talking about.<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, they've been saying maybe we ought to burn the boat, pack the skins on the mules, work our way back.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, sir, I don't know what's so important about this boat. I mean, without it, well, we'd be clear of the snow and onto flat lands by now.
The London jewellers.<eos> Some weeks ago, our firm was commissioned by a client to secure for him a particularly fine emerald which was to have been put on sale in Paris.<eos> Unfortunately, it was purchased before we could do so.<eos> And it is our understanding that you have it.<eos> We should like to purchase the stone from you.<eos> - At a considerable profit, of course.<eos> - The stone is not for sale.<eos> It's part of a matched pair, Mr. Williams.<eos> I have no notion of the value now that I have both of them.<eos> So you see, even if I wanted to sell it, I wouldn't know what price to put on it.
Bruno will tend to your wounds.<eos> Wait for me... in my bedroom.<eos> Everything is ready.<eos> To be fair and generous. I want to spare you from an unfair life.<eos> To ensure sure that your beauty won't be destroyed by time.<eos> And that you won't give birth to a cruel and greedy race.<eos> We accept your advice and we thank you.<eos> But please, leave us alone.<eos> No!<eos> Life is useless to those who don't believe in it.
Then he gave us a gun and said, "Blow him away!"<eos> One of us said to the other: "No, let someone else shoot him."<eos> Among the 1,500 prisoners they couldn't find a single one brave enough to take the gun from the Russians and shoot one of them.<eos> One day, in the manager's absence, Anita is fired<eos> Find someone else to do your crappy job!<eos> I've been doing the rooms all morning.<eos> It really wasn't me!<eos> Okay, I've taken stuff before, but not here!<eos> Where's my suitcase?<eos> You've taken it.
Here, I no sooner take a pair of socks off than it washes 'em.<eos> And it can cook, too.<eos> A bit limited on the menu.<eos> It goes in for Lancashire hotpot and steak and kidney pie.<eos> They blow you out a bit, but it does do a marvellous egg custard.<eos> I ain't never tasted nothing like it.<eos> It's pretty fair on the other, an' all.<eos> A bit on the shy side, but I find that makes quite a change these days.<eos> Oi. Turn it down a bit, Annie.<eos> It's in love, see. Now, when it listens to that stuff, It daydreams that the bloke who threw it over will one day want it back.
Firetrucks make si la, si la.<eos> And police makes re la, re la.<eos> - That's si la, si la.<eos> - No, that's re la, re la.<eos> - We're leaving.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - With you. - What about the champagne ?<eos> - At home.<eos> - What about the bill...<eos> - You're paying it.
- Yes, and I said, shut up.<eos> - Can I help you?<eos> - There is a radio here.<eos> - According to the Geneva Convention...<eos> - I know the code of ethics.<eos> If you believe there's a radio, search for it.<eos> If you know where, take it.<eos> - It's your job to enforce the law.<eos> - My job is to enforce civilized law.<eos> If you want to cite law, then obey it yourself.
Key West, Florida.<eos> About an hour and a half ago.<eos> We have helicopters in the area making 16 millimeter films of everything they can see from the air.<eos> Meanwhile, the coast line is blocked off and we're at the present time clearing the ocean for 200 miles off shore.<eos> How'd it happen?<eos> Nobody seems to know, exactly.<eos> One reports says there was a small explosion. Then everyone downwind started dying.<eos> We've closed down all the news media, but we won't be able to keep it quiet for long.<eos> What's the attitude in Washington?<eos> I would describe it as controlled panic.
I've been given an order, and if you don't take it I will have to spend all evening doing penance.<eos> Please!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Praise the Lord Jesus Christ.<eos> Help, Brother Felice!<eos> I'm dying!<eos> Help!<eos> Help, my arm!<eos> Perhaps you don't realise the seriousness of the sin you just committed.<eos> Life is the most precious of God's gifts, and you wish to renounce it?
We will be killed if you don't call Maurice. Labiche!<eos> Are you taking the night off?<eos> It'll be ready in a couple of hours, by morning.<eos> I'll take it through after dark.<eos> When it's ready get it out of here. Deliver it.<eos> - In broad daylight?<eos> - Deliver it.<eos> That engine has blocked work on four trains for the front.<eos> The Colonel gave orders for it to be given top priority.<eos> For all I care, it could be shot full of holes, and his precious train with it.
Well, I won't wait. I don't need Fletcher.<eos> I'll convene the hearing and you won't lie this time.<eos> You can't do that, senator.<eos> I've got to do it! Why?<eos> What does a day matter? Or two?<eos> You have the whip hand. I'm giving you a chance.<eos> Call the press, announce your withdrawal.<eos> Forget the president. I've given the president my word.<eos> Your word is not exactly the coin of the realm.<eos> No, maybe it isn't, thanks to your committee. But I still place a value on it.
I told you to call him!<eos> Immediately!<eos> Yes, I'm going.<eos> It's not my fault, that you'll be...<eos> - The morale?<eos> - Excellent!<eos> Excuse me, madam.<eos> Only there's no amusement out here.<eos> But this match made them enthusiastic.<eos> I hope you'll enjoy it, too, Madam.
Now, Jim is brilliant and witty.<eos> Uses words like a stiletto.<eos> He learned from Mencken, Ingersoll, Sinclair Lewis, other atheists.<eos> - Atheists!<eos> - But you own a radio station.<eos> Set the time.<eos> Half an hour.<eos> Tonight?<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> Name it.
She always said: "never worry about getting married... someday you'll turn the right corner and meet the right man."<eos> It isn't that easy.<eos> I've been turning corners for twenty-four years.<eos> You know, I think I finally turned the right one? Why go back out in that crowd and get lost again?<eos> Baby, if you're right, I'm in more trouble than I figured.<eos> You're 24 and I'm 38.<eos> You know, I might not be able to make it to the next corner?<eos> Mister... You've used that uniform for everything but what the government intended.<eos> Why you got the uniform is your concern... but what it does on this boat is my business.<eos> From here on, if that uniform leaves this cabin, don't be in it.
Bob, look, I've got an idea.<eos> How is he?<eos> It's an alien bacteria of some kind.<eos> So far the infection isn't critical, but our drugs don't even touch it.<eos> Col. Carruthers. I know this may sound horrible, but you were right and we were all wrong.<eos> It's taken this to prove it.<eos> It's moving around.<eos> Anne? Bob and I have a suggestion.<eos> We could get around behind the creature by going out the control room emergency air lock, moving down the hull to the emergency air lock on the motor level.<eos> That would put us one level below it. We might be able to surprise it that way.
I'm saved from disgrace, you hear?<eos> Excellent.<eos> Has someone died in the castle?<eos> - Where's your mistress?<eos> What did she die of?<eos> Of love for you, knight.<eos> Forgive me, O beautiful Altisidora!<eos> I wasn't aware that you've honoured me with love of such a great passion.<eos> It's a pity that I cannot challenge death to a duel.<eos> I would have gladly fought with it and forced it to correct this cruel injustice.
Let's forget about it.<eos> Mashenka!<eos> My darling!<eos> My good one!<eos> You don't know yourself how good you are.<eos> Say that you love me.<eos> I do, but I am grieved that you're so backward.<eos> Well, I've got some grievances, too.<eos> The revolution!<eos> I dreamed of it as of a bride.
Mashenka!<eos> My darling!<eos> My good one!<eos> You don't know yourself how good you are.<eos> Say that you love me.<eos> I do, but I am grieved that you're so backward.<eos> Well, I've got some grievances, too.<eos> The revolution!<eos> I dreamed of it as of a bride.<eos> I believed in it.
It began in London during the war.<eos> I had been wounded and discharged out of the Army.<eos> But I stayed on in London, for I was a writer, and had become interested in another group fighting the battle for England's survival, the men on the home front, the civil servants.<eos> A week earlier I had been introduced to one of these, Henry Miles, and he had asked me to a sherry party he and his wife were giving.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You have a charming house.<eos> I didn't quite imagine you in a house like this.<eos> Well, that's my wife's doing.<eos> She found it.
Huh? - Break it with a hammer!<eos> What?<eos> Now that it's fixed?<eos> - You want me to stay here?<eos> That depends.<eos> - Break the jar!<eos> No, don't break the jar!<eos> Don't break it! Don't touch that jar!<eos> This is a new case that never happened before.<eos> Either break it or at my own risk, I'll roll into a tree! Quick!
Did you hear what I said? Did you understand?<eos> He just told us.<eos> I offered them a thousand a piece.<eos> I'll double it for any of you if you'll help.<eos> A man is lying out there hurt, maybe dying.<eos> An American. - If that isn't enough...<eos> - The price is right.<eos> - But, why is it so high?<eos> - Is a man's life too high a price?<eos> I didn't put the price on it, you did.
- Yes, from me.<eos> - Who, me?<eos> Rather, shame on you to go around with this billycock!<eos> And you with that face!<eos> With your face, I wouldn't show up even at Carnival!<eos> But you'd be less obnoxious.<eos> Me, obnoxious?<eos> - Yes.<eos> My throat...<eos> - Well, cure it!
We've been close, but we've never been this close... and I see something in you I've never seen before, and I don't like it.<eos> - In fact, I hate it.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Contempt for the law, that's what you've got.<eos> It's a spreading disease.<eos> You think the law is something you can get over or get under or get around... or just plain flaunt.<eos> You start with that, and you wind up in the...<eos> Well, look at us.<eos> The law is the law, whether it's good or bad!<eos> If it's bad, change it, don't bust it wide open.
He said that?<eos> -Not paying attention.<eos> -pay attention to me.<eos> Bring the horse.<eos> Want to make money?<eos> There is a part of land which is sold in thousand pounds.<eos> I want you to buy.<eos> I wanted to buy many things, ... but no money.<eos> Potter you will Short-term loan.<eos> I will buy you this land by more than paid for it.
-Very little.<eos> Not responding.<eos> Knows more than he says. You are always with the governor.<eos> Adare said it is better.<eos> Get me a weight from above.<eos> The Lord follows mysterious ways for his miracles.<eos> All ends well.<eos> When you went, you will live in peace.<eos> I never had peace.<eos> I will with it.
You wouldn't know it's the same dame.<eos> You certainly haven't changed one bit.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Gee, you're as mean as can be.<eos> Mean as can be.<eos> Now what does that remind me of?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> That was in a song.<eos> She used to sing it.
Hans is ill.<eos> You need to help us.<eos> - Who will go down instead of Hans?<eos> - Pecka or I will have to do it.<eos> - Pecka can't do it.<eos> - Well, I'll go down then.<eos> Good.<eos> I'll be up in a minute.<eos> - The third chain has come undone.<eos> - I'll take care of it.
What do you know about it?<eos> Well, just enough to suspect it might be valuable.<eos> - Don't you agree?<eos> - I agree that we ought to try it.<eos> - We?<eos> - You and I.<eos> You do all the hard work, and I'll take all the glory, if any.<eos> That suit you?<eos> Sure.<eos> Any way you want it.
-Wish he had a family.<eos> -Be less complicated without.<eos> Look at that face. It's wonderful.<eos> They'll believe him.<eos> -What's your name.<eos> -John Willoughby.<eos> Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.<eos> Would you like to make some money?<eos> Yeah...maybe.<eos> Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter and stick by it?
Look at them! They're like old sacks.<eos> Like insects. They're worse than beasts.<eos> What? Won't you listen?<eos> They'll miss the tow!<eos> For God's sake, Charles, wake them up!<eos> What am I supposed to do.<eos> They won't budge!<eos> Bunch of dirty bastards!<eos> Let him fix the cable himself.<eos> And go in the water with it.
That's it.<eos> Tracy, what about you?<eos> You all right? Me?<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Why shouldn't I be?<eos> Well, that was a flock of wine we got away with.<eos> I guess we're lucky both to have such good heads.<eos> Yeah, yeah I guess that's it.<eos> Well, anyway I had a simply wonderful evening.<eos> - I hope you enjoyed it too. - I enjoyed the last part of it.
I don't want to complain, but there's an institution called dinner.<eos> I'm sort of hungry myself.<eos> Couldn't we have something brought in on trays like big executives?<eos> Sure.<eos> Dinner comes in on trays.<eos> We're big executives.<eos> We finish the bill before morning.<eos> It's dawn.<eos> Your bill is ready.<eos> You introduce it.
you would spare me such insults!<eos> Beloved as you are, your jibes cause me pain and distress.<eos> The race you spring from is dear to my heart but my anger, once roused, struck dread in their hearts.<eos> So, though I delight in you, glorious boy,<eos> do not rouse me to wrath!<eos> It would destroy you and me!<eos> Will you shut your mouth, you obstinate fool?<eos> Get out of my way, for this path will lead me to the rock where the woman lies asleep! The woodbird told me as much before it suddenly flew away.<eos> It flew away to save its life!<eos> It knew that the Lord of the Ravens was here, what would happen if they caught up with it!
No, no, could you look after some money for me?<eos> I won it on that horse.<eos> Only Sybil's a bit suspicious, you see?<eos> She goes through my pockets some nights.<eos> Oh, absolutely.<eos> Which horse?<eos> - Uh, Dragonfly.<eos> - When's it running?<eos> No, it ran today.<eos> I won that on it.
- I can't read.<eos> - Of course, you can't.<eos> No one has the time.<eos> We glance at things, we watch television.<eos> I like to watch TV.<eos> I'm sure you do. No one reads.<eos> He's very, very sexy.<eos> Don't leave me alone with him for too long.<eos> You say he showed you his garden.<eos> He said it was his. He walked us through it.
I wantcha to get my sister in John Hopkins right now!<eos> - Joe, give her 2 grand.<eos> Did she tell yuh?<eos> She's in a charity ward at Massachusetts General.<eos> - All right, I'll go see 'im!<eos> - And I wantcha to read dat article.<eos> - Leroy, what'd you do wid my Popular Science?<eos> - I ain't seen it, Specky.<eos> Dat thievin' damn Leroy!<eos> He took it, I know.
The chiaroscuro, obviously, is arbitrary.<eos> Why should certain figures, perhaps not the most important, be privileged and others remain a shadow?<eos> But setting aside the lighting, let us concentrate on the figures.<eos> All becomes clear.<eos> Let us reverse the lighting.<eos> Let what was plunged in shadow emerge into the light and what was clearly visible return to the darkness.<eos> The mask.<eos> There is the link with the next painting.<eos> We must then ask:<eos> which is that painting and why does the mask lead us to it?
I'll be lonely of course but... I do love you so dearly, Rowella.<eos> And I love you.<eos> Everything I do is for you, Arthur.<eos> Everything.<eos> It's good quality, Mary Ann, and Mr Mole unrolled it in the shop so I could see if there were no flaws.<eos> Knowing how good you are with a needle you could make anything.<eos> - Lucas gave us a bolt of silk.<eos> - Where did Lucas get silk?<eos> Off that wreck.<eos> Treasure trove, he calls it.
Huta Katowice - there is Wincenty Witek there.<eos> Engineer Wincenty Witek, the man we need in this movie. He must be, he is, we can...<eos> it can be arranged, it's been arranged.<eos> I've done worse things than that. If...<eos> And this must be done - unconditionally. - I can't talk to you any more,<eos> - I don't have the time. Goodbye.<eos> - You're going right to Huta Katowice. If we can't get it in another way, please, take it as an order.<eos> Go there.<eos> You have an appointment with Wincenty Witek. He'll be waiting for you.<eos> You should do it. You should do this interview.
In effect, it will function as synthetic spermatozoa.<eos> Have you considered what it's gonna look like?<eos> What do you need me for?<eos> You can do this on your own.<eos> I don't have the facilities here to duplicate the human womb.<eos> Tonight I will impregnate you.<eos> In 28 days, you will give birth to the child.<eos> And then what happens?<eos> Who looks after it then?<eos> What happens to it then?
- I'm Pooh.<eos> Oh, a Pooh, sure.<eos> - What's a Pooh?<eos> - You're sitting on one.<eos> I am? Oh, well, glad to meet ya.<eos> Name's Tigger.<eos> T, I, double "guh," err.<eos> That spells "Tigger."<eos> But what is a tigger?<eos> Well, he asked for it.
An old wheel rusts faster.<eos> It can't act as a weight very long.<eos> We'll have to use a new one.<eos> I think you've planned this for a long time.<eos> A truck driver told me it was the best way to dispose a body.<eos> Any better way?<eos> Let's think of a better way by tonight.<eos> I'll get ready to dispose it.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To the bathroom. It's the best place for it.
I'm coming, Lieschen.<eos> Are you still angry with me?<eos> About last night?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Haven't you shaved today?<eos> I overslept and only just got there in time.<eos> You look like the first dog I had.<eos> It was a griffon-terrier.<eos> A griffon?<eos> And were you fond of it?
- Absolutely not.<eos> - Only the cashier knew?<eos> Only the cashier, just him.<eos> I think that's enough.<eos> Thank you...<eos> and sorry for the inconvenience.<eos> I forgot one thing.<eos> You also heard one of the bandits speak with a foreign accent?<eos> - Yes, a foreign accent.<eos> - You heard it also.
It's nasty here!<eos> I never thought it would be so nasty, or I wouldn't have come!<eos> We can't go much further.<eos> We promised Mam'selle we wouldn't be long away.<eos> If only we could stay out all night... and watch the moon rise.<eos> Blanche said Sara writes poetry in the dunny!<eos> She found one there on the floor all about Miranda.<eos> She's an orphan.<eos> Sara reminds me of a little deer Papa brought home once.<eos> I looked after it but it died.
You never change your mind?<eos> - Not so hastily.<eos> Then, it's just a matter of time and time doesn't really exist.<eos> We've created it.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> With this.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> The brain is a dangerous tool.<eos> Indeed. But it's essential.<eos> Without it, there would be no love either.
Pollione, and Flavio wrapped in their togas enter cautiously.<eos> Their voices have ceased, and the way into the dreadful wood is open.<eos> Death lurks in this grove:<eos> Norma told you so.<eos> You have pronounced a name that chills my hearth.<eos> what are you saying your lover!<eos> The mother of your children!<eos> You can utter no reproach that I do not feel to be deserved;<eos> but the flame that once burned, in my heart is extinguished and a God it was extinguished it a God who is the enemy of my repose:<eos> at my feet I see the abyss yawning, and rush to hurl myself into it.
Strange as it may seem, I still love her... and however terrible I find these things... I am so captivated by her good nature... and her own serene charm... that, in spite of myself, in my heart of hearts... I'm inclined to forgive her.<eos> Can understand you entirely. Might feel the same way myself.<eos> But if that's how you feel, and you say:<eos> "l love this woman so much I can forgive everything"... and if one considers that this happened long, long ago... like something on a distant star... if that's the case, lnnstetten, I ask you...<eos> does it have to be? What's the good of it?<eos> It has to be done.<eos> I've looked at it all ways.<eos> One does not live alone. One is part of a larger whole.<eos> And we always have to bear the whole in mind.<eos> We are entirely dependent on it.
He must have something in it.<eos> I think, they will kill him.<eos> Would you have the courage to help him?<eos> You're the only one who can help us.<eos> I know he will kill Ursua and Armando.<eos> He will finish what he has started.<eos> You are my last hope.<eos> Thou lettest man flow on like a river and Thy years know no end.<eos> As for man his days are like grass as a flower on the field, so he blossoms.<eos> For when the wind passeth over it and it is gone, and the place thereof shall know it no more.
-but wait for the signal first.<eos> -What signal?<eos> You'll hear them announce a power failure.<eos> That'll be your chance.<eos> When will this signal come?<eos> That's it, we don't know.<eos> You'll just have to trust us, Varan.<eos> JAEGER: Surely you'll overload the whole power supply?<eos> Oh no, not a bit of it, old chap.<eos> That modulator's utterly reliable, but I'd be very grateful if you'd keep a close eye on it, would you?
The crystal of Kronos.<eos> - So I am right.<eos> - Kronos?<eos> Well, that's what Stuart said.<eos> Look, Doctor, what is all this about?<eos> Well, it'll be difficult to accept, I warn you.<eos> Well, try me.<eos> Well, luckily, you are already familiar with the idea of stepping outside of space-time.<eos> I've lived with the concept for months.<eos> And I've lived with it for many long years.
It's the principle that could raise individuals up to form a community.<eos> The woman is quite melancholic.<eos> The man too looks depressed, influenced by her.<eos> They seem to have sufficient qualities to become our fellows.<eos> - Shigeo.<eos> Mamoru.<eos> - Yes?<eos> You go!<eos> Watch out for policemen.<eos> When I look at the sea, I feel as though I were being gradually pulled towards it.
I suppose you can take the normal precautions... against nuclear blast, like... sticky tape on the windows and that sort of thing.<eos> Right there. - Filer, no.<eos> He's helping us, we need him.<eos> Are you crazy, Brigadier?<eos> Probably, but we've got no choice.<eos> - Yeah, but...<eos> - Filer.<eos> - Thank you. - Where are you going?<eos> - Back into this contraption.<eos> Well, theoretically it should be able to store... all the power generated around it, like it solar cell battery.
The hidden killer, carbon monoxide<eos> And the ever-present threat of pneumoconiosis which is a... A disease miners get.<eos> Don't you talk to me like that You lying bastard.<eos> You bleeding pig. You're not fit to be down a mine.<eos> Typical bleeding rhondda, isn't it.<eos> You think you're so bloody clever.<eos> You're bloody fighting again?<eos> Break it up Or I'll put this pick through your head.<eos> Now what's it all about?<eos> He started it.
Come on, hurry up!<eos> Get those suits on!<eos> Dr Williams, the coolant pipes.<eos> Get me some extra power laid on for the reserve supplies. Come on!<eos> Prepare to alter your pressure readings!<eos> Begin readings at 1 2.<eos> Hold your pressure at 50...40.<eos> Get back!<eos> Get back to your posts!<eos> If this place goes up, we'll all go up with it!
- No, please don't bother.<eos> - But I have to show you where things are.<eos> - No, I'll find them.<eos> Go read your newspaper.<eos> Cookie?<eos> Do you know where Daddy's slippers are?<eos> Go and get them.<eos> - All right, finish your yogurt.<eos> - I don't like yogurt.<eos> You say you don't like it, but maybe it doesn't like you.
The blood that incites a brother to grief the feeling of nothing which leads to love.<eos> Death like faith, not like fear.<eos> Why, Paulo?<eos> Why do you wallow in this chaos?<eos> Which chaos?<eos> Look, Vieira can't speak.<eos> Nobody won't, for over a century.<eos> You've thrown Vieira into an abyss. Me?<eos> The abyss is here, wide-open.<eos> We all march towards it.
To it, Hal!<eos> Go on, boy!<eos> It will be not easy, Percy!<eos> Harry, thou hast robb'd me of youth.<eos> I better brook the loss of brittle life, than those proud titles thou hast won of me.<eos> They wound my thought worse than thy sword my flesh, but thought's the slave of life and life, time's fool, and time must have a stop.<eos> O, I could prophesy but that the earthly and cold hand of death lies on my tongue.<eos> Percy thou are dust, and food for for worms, brave Percy.<eos> Fare thee well, great heart.<eos> iii weav'd ambition when that this body did contain a spirit, a kingdom for it was too small a bound, but nowtwo paces of heaven, is room enough.
-Where did he put the receipts?<eos> There, in his chest pocket.<eos> I saw them myself.<eos> He put them in an envelope and in his pocket.<eos> It's more than 100 million.<eos> He was a good friend. I'd like to see him one more time.<eos> Me too.<eos> -Where's the body?<eos> We need to find it.<eos> -You said you wanted to get rid of it.
Why did you marry Crane Adams?<eos> Shall I help?<eos> You both loved music.<eos> He lost his arm in the holy war to free the slaves, lost music with his arm.<eos> So you made it up to him, hating slavery as you do.<eos> If you do.<eos> Because I've never seen it?<eos> Can't you hate an idea?<eos> I hated it.<eos> - And loved Crane for hating it too?
Why are you breathing like that?<eos> Some people take a drink... ..others take a pill.<eos> I just take a few deep breaths.<eos> Well... ..don't be frightened about it.<eos> He was amazing, just amazing... ..until he started having these little, whatever they are, these spells.<eos> When they started, I... ..tried to persuade him to go back to Nantucket but he said, "No.<eos> Mexico."<eos> So Mexico it is.<eos> And he wouldn't rest anywhere, until he got to the sea.<eos> "The cradle of life," as he calls it.
We are to collect it tomorrow.<eos> So there is a future for us.<eos> - He's coming.<eos> - Yes. Now, all of you, watch very carefully.<eos> See that you notice every detail in that machine, all right?<eos> Move back from the door.<eos> Take the food.<eos> I'll be able to jam the door with a piece of this.<eos> - He seemed to be able to cover all of us.<eos> - It's impossible to hide from it.
No footsteps, no doors closing, no wind whistling through the cracks - just absolute silence.<eos> He goes to the window - no car, no tracks."<eos> Will you use a series of different shots or one continuous shot of the priest?<eos> Well, you see, I will partly use the sound.<eos> You see, when working in close conjunction with the audio track, it's like an accompanying chord, although unnoticeable.<eos> The most important thing is to create a complete -<eos> As he recovers from his fever attack, there is this complete silence.<eos> I would minimize the usual noise in the studio, or in the church, or in these surroundings.<eos> The normal background noise, I will minimize even that.<eos> Each movement will be accompanied by almost no sound at all, thus creating a frightening silence around it.
If you like.<eos> Do you want to hear it, or don't you?<eos> Do you want to hear it?<eos> - Would you like a glass of water?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm ashamed of myself.<eos> I'm acting like a... Like a young girl.<eos> I dreamt that we had a child.<eos> The baby looked like you with fuzzy brown hair all over his head and soft all over.<eos> And the back of his neck was straight and proud like yours.<eos> The little thing was hungry, so I opened myself to it.
Is that right. And what did he do?<eos> He ate everything that was offered and later loosened his belt<eos> Such a big eater<eos> He must have been famished<eos> Perhaps but when we took a stroll after the hotel dinner...<eos> You two were left alone?<eos> Yes, they urged us to take a walk<eos> And what happened?<eos> He asked me whether I disliked western food<eos> His answer to the same question was that he disliked it after all he ate
"Lord, illuminate my conscience that I may know how I have offended thee..." "And atone by a humble confession..."<eos> Must I repeat that?<eos> Yes, but take your time. There's no rush.<eos> "And atone... by a humble confession, sincere contrition, and true penance."<eos> "Thy kindly spirit will lead me back to the path of truth."<eos> "Lord, thou shalt restore me in thy justice."<eos> Your hands are still pure, aren't they?<eos> No, Father.<eos> Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.<eos> You owe it the greatest respect.
Do not go in.<eos> OK, Gaston. All right.<eos> Thank you for warning us.<eos> Now, we won't be long.<eos> Go about your work.<eos> Poor old fellow.<eos> It disturbs him when anyone comes here.<eos> He remembers too much.<eos> This laboratory has been locked since the day André died.<eos> It's just as he left it.
Would responsible men ever sign such rigmarole?<eos> Whatever its terms... the treaty was made under the threat of Commodore Perry's guns.<eos> Such a treaty has no virtue.<eos> Have you forgotten why Commodore Perry came?<eos> Because shipwrecked sailors were being beheaded... and because no ship could put in to a Japanese port, even for water.<eos> We only wish to be left alone.<eos> Your Excellency, your country stands at the crossroads of the world.<eos> From both East and West, men are finding an ever-increasing need for those roads.<eos> If, in your desire for isolation... you refuse to make them safe for peaceful traffic... the world will treat Japan as it would treat a band of brigands... infesting a highway.<eos> A true Japanese would rather see his country perish in flames... and perish with it than see it corrupted by foreigners... and slowly rot.
Their bellies are empty, Captain, but none of them will touch it.<eos> The rice, the soup... They may have poisoned everything.<eos> Eat it, comrade.<eos> It'll make you big and strong.<eos> Or dead.<eos> If I may suggest, eminent brother... there is no poison but the poison they put in our minds.<eos> They make us fear our own food in order to starve and weaken us.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Stay out of this.<eos> He'll test it for us.
Looks like they messed up your rose garden a little here, Gus.<eos> Somebody owes you an apology.<eos> How about you folks all going home now?<eos> I think this'll do for tonight.<eos> Good evening, Mrs. Albrecht.<eos> - May I?<eos> - Come in.<eos> This place will be fixed up just like it was before.<eos> - I'm gonna see to it. - Ja.<eos> He will see to it.
That's the way Texas is, they say, and that's the way for us.<eos> It ain't we don't like people. We like room more. Room to stretch in.<eos> Where you set foot, no foot's been set before.<eos> That's what ails Kentucky.<eos> A man can't move without he nudges a neighbour.<eos> Here, Faro!<eos> Heel!<eos> Get him.<eos> - You there, call your dog off.<eos> - He didn't start it.
You must be on the lonesome side.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> You ever think of getting a parrot?<eos> A what?<eos> That would be nice company.<eos> Somebody to talk to.<eos> I mean, something.<eos> And, of course, there's lots of parrots can talk.<eos> So then you could be talking to it, and it could be talking to you, and... I mean, you probably wouldn't be talking to each other, but it'd be talk.
But you want me to leave.<eos> I was just saying...<eos> If you want to stay, you can.<eos> Do you want to sleep here?<eos> You can leave in the morning.<eos> - Well?<eos> - No, I have things to do.<eos> A present.<eos> Don't say anything to Gino, if you run into him.<eos> He gave it to me.
Is there anything I can do?<eos> Look, I don't know your trouble, but you don't look very well to me.<eos> A little brandy can't do you any harm.<eos> Why not drink it?<eos> My great-aunt died over a glass of brandy, but it was her 15th that day.<eos> - Feeling any better?<eos> - Yes, thank you.<eos> You left your lunch over there.<eos> It won't feel lonely.<eos> I'll go back to it in a minute.
It was a job on a boat going to South America.<eos> I asked for it, got it.<eos> Since you wouldn't go looking for a boat, a boat came for you.<eos> Exactly. Anyway, that did it.<eos> How can selling trains at Crowley's help you to build boats?<eos> Oh, the trouble with you is you don't believe in happy endings.<eos> I've got a friend I met in the Army.<eos> He's got a little boatyard down in Balboa, California.<eos> It's not much now, but it could be built into something.<eos> I'm buying into it.
- What are you doing here?<eos> - He brought a note from Dad.<eos> Well, I tried to tell her but she wouldn't give me a chance.<eos> Alright you delivered the note. Now, get out.<eos> Well, for once you bit off more than you can chew.<eos> - That him?<eos> - Yeah, what do you think?<eos> - Hmm, maybe.<eos> - Maybe my foot, Manker!<eos> You gotta get hit on the head with it?
Your children shall be kings.<eos> You shall be king.<eos> If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me, without my stir.<eos> Look, how our partner's rapt.<eos> Hail, king that shalt be!<eos> This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee.<eos> Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.<eos> Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be what thou art promised.<eos> Come, you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, and fill me from the crown to the toe top-full of direst cruelty!<eos> Make thick my blood; Stop up the access and passage to remorse, That no compunctious visitings of nature, Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between the effect and it!
Well, you see, we at Friars Carmel do not consider Miss Brown merely as a maid.<eos> No.<eos> We are very proud of our Cluny and interested in her welfare.<eos> - And, above all, in her friends.<eos> - Naturally.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> - It's 7:00, Miss Brown.<eos> - Yes. How time flies.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> But we must learn to fly with it.
- No.<eos> Turn it off!<eos> - Now wait a minute, pal.<eos> That was mine, that penny.<eos> This is a free country, and I play whatever I want to.<eos> OK.<eos> Sure, and if you don't like it, you don't have to listen to it.<eos> And you can leave here any time, you want to. OK OK.<eos> I'm sorry I am.<eos> First good piece played tonight, and you don't like it.
Forget it.<eos> Forget it?<eos> Tala!<eos> Well? Say, what is this?<eos> What do you mean? What do I mean?<eos> Good morning, Arlita.<eos> Good morning, Tala.<eos> You have made yourself very pretty today. See what I mean?<eos> Have my horse saddled and sent around right away, will you?<eos> And have that Rocklin bring it.
- What am I gonna do with you, young lady?<eos> - I'll look after her.<eos> - Susan, don't be absurd.<eos> - She won't be any trouble.<eos> Fine, Miss Parker.<eos> Bring her to my quarters after lunch and we'll have a talk with her.<eos> - You can return to your post now, Jenkins. - Aye, sir.<eos> See you later, stowaway.<eos> Captain, can we put this... animal in the kennel?<eos> Oh! They'll take good care of it.
Thank you.<eos> Do you mind if I keep this door open?<eos> I'd sleep in a cold sweat if you didn't.<eos> You know, this is a very tricky house.<eos> Kind of place where I like to have company.<eos> So this guy Poelzig is a great architect?<eos> Yes.<eos> One of the greatest.<eos> Well, I suppose we've got to have architects, too.<eos> If I wanted to build a nice, cozy, unpretentious insane asylum, he'd be the man for it.
A little hope. Ha, look at old Maze! Got my bar, family.<eos> Make sure you put your knives on for the right reason, son.<eos> What if you kill Fender?<eos> What then?<eos> What about the rest of your life?<eos> So the cure's not important, huh?<eos> I got your ball!<eos> Knock it off, or I'll bash your brains out.<eos> Hey!<eos> I don't think this is yours.
My poor heart longs for you<eos> It's beating here all alone<eos> So hurry, please Oh hurry home<eos> Life is oh so short<eos> Hurry to me<eos> My love, my own<eos> You give me everything<eos> Hurry, please<eos> Hurry to me<eos> Everything here is yours
Stay back!<eos> Boss, the bastard's right in front!<eos> Run over him!<eos> Yes.<eos> Step on it, run over him.<eos> We'll be all right.<eos> Freeze!<eos> You're under arrest, but you have the right to...<eos> If you let me go...<eos> this is all yours.
Where's the gold?<eos> There is no gold, ruffian.<eos> I tell you, I have no gold!<eos> You have fine raiment, boy, almost as resplendent as mine.<eos> And you expect me to believe you're penniless?<eos> I'll have you know, villain, I am Prince Tarn of Hablok.<eos> My subjects will see to your punishment for this.<eos> And a grievous punishment it will be, impertinent oaf!<eos> Your subjects?<eos> My kingdom is greater than yours.
I'm afraid so.<eos> Newman, I don't want you to die.<eos> Don't cry, son.<eos> You'll be all right.<eos> We had some good times together, haven't we?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll miss you.<eos> Just remember... to keep drawing that line.<eos> Just as you did today.<eos> stand firmly by... and the world will be yours.
Doctor, we must form a plan.<eos> I propose, one, we withdraw to a position of temporary security.<eos> Two, we reconfigure our two Tardises into time cone invertors.<eos> Three, we create a stable safe zone by applying temporal inversion isometry to as much of space-time as we can isolate.<eos> Look!<eos> -Horrible!<eos> -Hardly more horrible than shrinking people.<eos> No.<eos> Do what you like, Doctor.<eos> Logopolis is yours.
Who is he?<eos> He's Wong Wa po, my Brother I see<eos> What?<eos> He's stronger and faster than you<eos> His eyes are bigger and he's more of a man<eos> Drink it hot!<eos> Frankly, you're better than him<eos> He has no power<eos> And he's fate as a pig<eos> His kung fu is worse than yours
I was born in Virginia.<eos> Where are you from?<eos> Los Angeles.<eos> I'm going home tomorrow.<eos> Los angeles. Is that near Hollywood?<eos> Right next door, little button.<eos> Oh! Take me with you!<eos> I want to go to Hollywood too.<eos> So, What is your name, Ms. Ambitious?<eos> I will tell you mine if you tell me yours. Serking.
Wait there.<eos> Son of Jor-El!<eos> We were beginning to think you were a coward!<eos> I'm not a coward.<eos> Let him prove it!<eos> Then die as you deserve to!<eos> Come on, get him!<eos> This is going to be good!<eos> Take him.<eos> He's yours.
(Dent) I'll tell thee summat about t'pig.<eos> Oh, yes?<eos> - If you gets hold of her remember to force its jaw shut before it can force it open.<eos> I'll keep that in mind.<eos> - Now, then, Richard, when Mr Dent gets the noose over the snout you get the tourniquet around her ear and get a couple of CCs of blood.<eos> Perfectly straightforward.<eos> - Right.<eos> (Dent) Ready then, lad?<eos> - Whenever you are.<eos> It's all yours.
Lack of discipline cannot be tolerated.<eos> Come on, K9. Come on.<eos> Die, traitor.<eos> Not now, can't you see I'm busy?<eos> It won't work in here.<eos> It's a patrol staser.<eos> It doesn't operate, you see?<eos> Not in a relative-dimensional stabiliser field.<eos> What treachery are you attempting now?<eos> A rather more effective treachery than yours, I hope.
Real, perfect and purely Japanese her breasts...her beautiful nipples ...they are mine<eos> Let's call a psychiatrist With a lunatic...<eos> No, let's see, if the people will learn...<eos> Finally we are alone, just the two of us!<eos> There's nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> I love you.<eos> Relax your legs<eos> What's this noise?<eos> See yourself, your son!<eos> Pure and perfect Japanese my body is yours, and your body is mine
Not good enough?<eos> Maybe too good, I don't know.<eos> I just can't handle it.<eos> Thank you very much for everything, but I'm leaving.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sort of lost my appetite.<eos> I better find you a place to sleep, preacher.<eos> No need.<eos> That bed in there will suit me just fine and dandy.<eos> It's fine and dandy, but it ain't yours.
Yes, on his perch.<eos> - Parrot? ! An angel!<eos> An angel that saves, that destroys, that kidnaps with his wings, that frees and kills with his sword of fire!<eos> How decadent I am tonight! Oh!<eos> What a nice dog!<eos> Come here dog, come...<eos> up. Come here, come, up!<eos> Come on!<eos> What do you want, cheerful?<eos> - Is it yours?
My wedding is coming up soon, and my bride-to-be is the daughter of a big boss around these parts.<eos> You got that?<eos> I think I do, yes.<eos> I could never turn this boy over to a man like you.<eos> I won't turn him over.<eos> I'll raise him myself.<eos> I'll raise him to be a fine young man, for Otoyo's sake.<eos> I take it you have no objections?<eos> You're a really odd one, blind man.<eos> The kid is yours.
Don't do that to me! - clear it up!<eos> - Not my fault, them dregs!<eos> - Oh, you filthy bastard.<eos> - Right, I'm leaving.<eos> - That's what I want. - Don't talk to me like that.<eos> - After all I've done for you!<eos> - Get down and clear it up.<eos> - I won't stand for this.<eos> - Take your pigsty elsewhere.<eos> - It's not my pigsty, it's yours. - Creep! - Nobody talks to me like that.
It's a tragic treasure.<eos> Mr. Haze purchased it when he found out he was ill.<eos> He wanted to spare me the sight of his suffering.<eos> Happily or unhappily, he was hospitalized before he could use it.<eos> Will you put it down, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's better now, isn't it?<eos> Oh, you man!<eos> Darling you know I have a most ambitious fantasy.<eos> What's yours?
And your daughter's.<eos> Well, of course.<eos> I want to take this auspicious occasion to say that this young fellow right over here is gonna grow up to be one of Reata's top hands.<eos> Hi, Daddy.<eos> I mean, this boy's gonna be the best.<eos> He may even grow up to be better than his old man. Maybe.<eos> Oh, girls, look at the pony.<eos> Come on, look at that.<eos> There he is, son.<eos> - He's all yours.
And its breath...<eos> Ooh, its breath was like a furnace!<eos> Ooh, you got a pretty strong breath yourself,<eos> My easy-talkin' friend.<eos> You mind answering a few questions?<eos> I'm a harpooner by trade, and monsters interest me...<eos> All kinds.<eos> Keep away from him, you noisy sea lawyer!<eos> Just want to smell his breath.<eos> I can already smell yours.
You did ask me to dinner, didn't you?<eos> I sure did.<eos> What are they doing up there?<eos> I don't know, but I'm hoping for the best.<eos> - Meanwhile, we'll starve to death.<eos> - Oh, here they come.<eos> Boy, you look like 100 cents on the dollar.<eos> - Do you think is too much, darling? - Oh, no.<eos> Your figure isn't bad at all.<eos> Just as good as yours, tootsie.
- The candid cameraman?<eos> - Thanks. I'll look later.<eos> The candid cameraman?<eos> Ben!<eos> How do I look?<eos> If you take your hands out of your pocket, I could tell better.<eos> Come.<eos> Turn around.<eos> It fits perfectly.<eos> I've got to get yours out of the attic.
He doesn't like me dancing with other men.<eos> Oh, Clive...can I help?<eos> - I see you've managed.<eos> - Yes, I've managed...thanks all the same.<eos> - Why did you come back. darling?<eos> - I changed my mind.<eos> "What did I want with a holiday?"... I asked myself.<eos> A holiday away from my beautiful wife!<eos> Your drink my dear...<eos> And here's yours, Bill.
- Then put on your most outrageous dress.<eos> - Shall I wear the purple with the plumes at the hips?<eos> - The purple with the plumes at the hips?<eos> - Yes. You know. It's cut down on one shoulder, and the coq feathers shoot off one hip like a tail of a comet.<eos> I know it only too well.<eos> Wear the purple with the plumes at the hips, by all means.<eos> - And let it be a purple lesson to me.<eos> - All right, my darling.<eos> - What was the matter with you tonight, Alfred?<eos> Something so vulgar, so utterly contemptible and unworthy of a love like yours... I beg of you never to make me tell you.
- For another world.<eos> You don't mean...?<eos> But, my dear friend, that is just what I do mean.<eos> Oh, this is absolutely fantastic!<eos> June!<eos> All right, and what if I refuse to go?<eos> But you cannot refuse.<eos> Your time was up.<eos> Now, by mistake, you overstayed by about, speaking in time, of course, 20 hours.<eos> The advantage was exclusively yours.
But then, my love you so seldom are right.<eos> -For example?<eos> -For example, Cádiz.<eos> Loss of men.<eos> The drain on the treasury.<eos> I might have known you'd try to dig me with that.<eos> No matter what you think, what I did there pleased England.<eos> Is it my fame you think of, my lord, or your own?<eos> Haven't you built your name high enough?<eos> In spite of your blunder at Cádiz, there's no name like yours in England.
This necklace.<eos> It's been on quite a journey.<eos> Your dad gave it to me... to celebrate the beginning of our family.<eos> But, you know-<eos> Our family had really already begun.<eos> Bye, Clearance Puppy.<eos> A dog has no use for fancy cars... or big homes or designer clothes.<eos> A waterlogged stick will dojust fine.<eos> A dog doesn't care if you're rich or poor... clever or dull, smart or dumb.<eos> Give 'em your heart and he'll give you his.
Hello, Ching.<eos> And this... is Lao Si.<eos> I saw a wolf, but I didn't cry.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Coffee?<eos> And steamed bread, with honey.<eos> Honey?<eos> Come on, Lao Si.<eos> He'll have that bread off you, if you as much as blink.<eos> His main objective in life is greater rotundity.
Nah, I didn't think so.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Well... what if we rented one of those self-storage places, you know, those little orange garages, worked out of there?<eos> No.<eos> They're on to that.<eos> They got dogs that sniff around.<eos> That's what you want.<eos> What, like a Winnebago?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know a dude who wants to sell his.
This is what we think happened to this man?<eos> He was made to believe he's Sloane?<eos> Not just believe, but to act.<eos> Among other things, he shares the same desires, which explains his pursuit of Rambaldi artifacts.<eos> Well, if you think about it, this guy's been able to stay two steps ahead of us the entire time.<eos> He thinks like you, he knows your strategies, your playbooks, your secrets.<eos> When we were in Santiago going after Sloane Clone the first time, you knew the access code to his facility -- "Jacquelyn."<eos> I had no reference for that.<eos> It just came to me.<eos> Probably because it's buried deep inside your subconscious, which also means it's buried inside his.
You can take his freedom, his legs, but not his feelings.<eos> Not his feelings.<eos> That's it.<eos> There you go.<eos> Pull, pull.<eos> Like that.<eos> A man loves a woman.<eos> No matter what kind of man he is, if he loves her, he wants her.<eos> He wants her body.<eos> He wants her to want his.
The hero sees something strange.<eos> But then it turns out to be nothing.<eos> Sometimes its hard to distinguish between fantasy and reality.<eos> But this was real!<eos> When I've been working hard I feel as if I'm in a glass bubble.<eos> Or in a movie.<eos> When I'm trying to catch a murderer, I try to think like him.<eos> I somehow dissolve.<eos> Right and wrong cease to exist.<eos> But I know I've got him when I look in a mirror and see his face.
If I do this and I mean if it's because I want to do this for you.<eos> That's all.<eos> For you.<eos> Don't go anywhere.<eos> Shit!<eos> Great.<eos> I'm hearing horses now.<eos> Parry will be so pleased.<eos> Radio personality turns screwball on mission from God.<eos> I just hope when they put me away they find me a place right next to his.
Sometimes to the point of being tyrannical.<eos> To make it worse, I live with a compulsively messy man.<eos> What happens?<eos> We have spats, nothing serious.<eos> If I didn't stay at Mathieu's this week it's not because I feel lonely without him but because I can't stand his kind of order.<eos> I can only stand it when he's there.<eos> Because you love him.<eos> Yes, I'd have to love him a lot.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> If you were madly in love with him you'd forget your own sense of order and accept his.
This is the warden's car.<eos> Do you think Chink Weber did this?<eos> Drumgoole did this.<eos> Did you think that we would take our dates out with it?<eos> Rotate it on weekends?<eos> Ernie, you take it on Friday, Dallas on Saturday.<eos> And Eclipse, you got it Sunday.<eos> Is that what you thought?<eos> It's his!<eos> This lift, the tools the whole garage is his!
- That's it.<eos> - What?<eos> That's my ticket.<eos> That man took it.<eos> - Again?<eos> - What?<eos> He took it from me!<eos> - One ticket missing.<eos> - Exactly!<eos> - He says that here everything is his own.
You're too much.<eos> Good morning.<eos> It's a nice day.<eos> Good morning, sensei.<eos> You've read the letters?<eos> You three must not follow our example.<eos> But we're ready to -<eos> The letters are very clear.<eos> No matter what happens, make sure the general does not commit seppuku.<eos> This is our day... not his.
Displace one phrase, and the structure would fall.<eos> It was clear to me that sound I had heard in the archbishop 's palace had been no accident.<eos> Here again was the very voice of God.<eos> I was staring through the cage of those meticulous ink strokes at an absolute beauty.<eos> Is it not good?<eos> It is miraculous.<eos> Yes, he's very proud of his work.<eos> So you will help us?<eos> I dine with the emperor tomorrow evening.<eos> One word from me and the post is his.
Oh, you learn quickly.<eos> That's good.<eos> I like that.<eos> What kind of man was my father?<eos> Oh, he was brave, he was strong.<eos> He was a great knight.<eos> Was he a great king?<eos> Well, he was rash.<eos> He never learned how to look into men's hearts.<eos> Least of all his own.
Good idea!<eos> Then everybody here will come to you<eos> Great!<eos> I've found your opponent where is he?<eos> The lad over there<eos> Who is he?<eos> Leung Chang the street brawler<eos> Overturn a table then<eos> Not mine, you fool!<eos> His!
Then I'd say, I'll not abandon you in your distress.<eos> And Christoph: Grant...<eos> O grant me for a moment the present back again!<eos> And though a man be silenced by his pain A God gave me the power to say how much I suffer.<eos> I took great pains, but in the end he had to admit he didn't have what it takes.<eos> At least I helped him retain his chance of survival. At first, he was as if paralyzed.<eos> It went on for years, this grieving apathy before he finally made up his mind to be the way he'd learned a man should be:<eos> active, decisive, independent, apparently. All that time he lived off me, and he wasn't ashamed of it. That was important for me.<eos> He wasn't the type to be a pimp even though our money came from other men with whom I slept.<eos> At first he used to ask me about them. How they were, what they said... whether they were tender and loving whether they had special wishes what their bodies were like, especially their dicks. Whether they were big, bigger than his.
What?<eos> It's true, isn't it?<eos> But you are wrong.<eos> It is yours, without any doubt.<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> Do you think I'm refusing because of that?<eos> The blood of a baby is but a notion.<eos> The proof would be a married couple whose baby was mixed up with another by mistake.<eos> The longer they live together, the less they'd want to abandon the child.<eos> If a man regards a baby as his, then it is his.
A hundred years ago, Africa was a vast, dark unknown.<eos> Only a few explorers and missionaries... the ivory hunters and the infamous slave raiders... risked their lives on its blood-soaked trails. Gleaming tusks were the prize... and sweating slaves sold by their own kings and chiefs in the ceaseless tribal wars... or seized by slavers.<eos> The lion and the leopard hunted savagely among the huge herds of game.<eos> And man, lacking the will to understand other men... became like the beasts.<eos> And their way of life was his.
Not smart like us!<eos> Yep.<eos> Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?<eos> - How about I bring him some?<eos> - It isn't food he's hungry for.<eos> Then let me tie a can to his tail.<eos> Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> It's a free country.<eos> And it's his.
I ask nothing for myself, O God.<eos> By my sins I have put myself beyond the compass of thy forgiveness.<eos> But lift thine hand from thy people who suffer for my crimes.<eos> Forgive them the sin that is not theirs but mine.<eos> Let the land thou gavest their fathers flow once more with thine abundance.<eos> And let Bathsheba live to praise thy name and testify to thy mercy.<eos> Show her the loving kindness of thy heart.<eos> Cleanse her from sin and let thy punishment fall on thy servant who has earned it.<eos> Look not on the sinner who comes before thee but on the boy he was who loved thee and who would have died for thee.<eos> Make my heart as his.
Is he to go?<eos> Set him free!<eos> Slink off home!<eos> No knot holds you<eos> Am I free?<eos> Truly free?<eos> Then thus I give you my freedom's first greeting!<eos> Since by curse it came to me, accursed be this ring!<eos> Since its gold gave me might may its magic bring death to whoever wears it!<eos> It shall gladden no happy man
He went off my car and was hit by the other...<eos> Just a second. I'm talking to the police.<eos> - He was lying bleeding on the road.<eos> - What seems to be the trouble?<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Don't give your name to the cops.<eos> - You wanna get on their master list?<eos> - Leavenworth and Turk.<eos> I'll hold.<eos> But it isn't!
You listen to me, darlin'.<eos> You're something extra special.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Why, someday a mama and a papa will come to the orphanage lookin' for a pretty little girl just like you.<eos> - Honest?<eos> - I'll bet my whiskers on it.<eos> But you've got to believe it. Keep the faith, sweetheart.<eos> Do you see that bluebird? - Yes, I do.<eos> - Well, faith is a bluebird you see from afar.<eos> You can't touch it or buy it or wrap it up tight, but it's there just the same, making things turn out right.
my wizard and my way.<eos> I'm armed with an elvish blade!<eos> That's better.<eos> Perhaps you know the way out?<eos> Perhaps ye sits here... my preciousss.<eos> It... likes ... riddles?<eos> Do I like riddles?<eos> after a fashion.<eos> It must have a competition with us.<eos> If precious asks and it doesn't answer... my precious.
That's better.<eos> Perhaps you know the way out?<eos> Perhaps ye sits here... my preciousss.<eos> It... likes ... riddles?<eos> Do I like riddles?<eos> after a fashion.<eos> It must have a competition with us.<eos> If precious asks and it doesn't answer... my precious.<eos> I say!<eos> But if it asks us and we doesn't answer then we shows it the way out!
- So?<eos> - So it's like you said.<eos> He's a big liar.<eos> Here, this is certainly a human tooth.<eos> But... haven't you at least found a buckle or a ring...<eos> - Is it possible there's nothing left?<eos> - If you want we can sift the ashes.<eos> If that's all that's left of him it won't tell us much about the young man!<eos> - If it's him.<eos> - Let's assume it is.
That's what's wrong with it. No, it's resting.<eos> Look. Look, my lad, I know a dead parrot when I see one and I'm looking at one now.<eos> No, that's not dead, it's resting.<eos> - Resting?<eos> - Yeah, resting.<eos> Remarkable bird, the Norwegian blue, isn't it?<eos> Beautiful plumage.<eos> The plumage don't enter into it.<eos> It's still dead.<eos> No, it's resting.
That parrot is definitely deceased, and when I bought it a half hour ago... you assured me that its total lack of movement... was due to it being tired and shagged out after a long squall.<eos> Well, he's pining for the fjords.<eos> Pinin' for the fjords?<eos> What kind of talk is that?<eos> Look, why did it fall flat on its back the minute I got it home?<eos> Well, the Norwegian blue prefers keeping on its back.<eos> Beautiful plumage.<eos> Look, I took the liberty of examining that parrot and I discovered... the only reason it had been sitting on its perch in the first place... was that it had been nailed there.<eos> Oh, well, of course it was nailed there.<eos> If I hadn't nailed it there, it would have muscled up to those bars and boom.
I never feel drowsy. I haven't got anything to feel drowsy with.<eos> Nothing?<eos> Maybe we should take a different line of attack, altogether.<eos> Let us begin by assuming that everything is a dream, which by and large, it is.<eos> When we're awake, we have one kind of dream. When we're asleep, we have another.<eos> The difference is that we control our daydreams.<eos> And the dream that comes at night controls us.<eos> Now think about that.<eos> When you dream that the rat is there, do you control the dream? Or does the dream control you?<eos> It controls me.
He loved me too.<eos> Are you the one he used to take swimming out at the tank?<eos> He told you about that, huh?<eos> Yeah, I was the one.<eos> I guess if it wasn't for Sam I'd just about have missed it.<eos> Whatever it is.<eos> I'd have been one of them amity types that thinks that playing bridge is the best thing that life has to offer.<eos> Old Sam the Lion.<eos> Nobody knows where he got that name. I gave it to him.<eos> One night it just came to me.
I'm more interesting than a wet pussycat.<eos> ...for hour after hour after hour...<eos> "Interesting People" brings you- a man who claims he can send bricks to sleep by hypnosis. Mr. Keith Maniac from Guatemala.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Keith, you claim you can send bricks to sleep.<eos> Yes, that is correct, I can.<eos> Entirely by hypnosis.<eos> Yes, I use no artificial means whatsoever.<eos> You've injured mr.<eos> Stools! Well, I simply- stare at the brick, and it goes to sleep.
There were no vegetables in town?<eos> Sunchokes, rutabaga. Pig food.<eos> Am I to blame for the war?<eos> Well, he's certainly not. So let him eat in peace.<eos> You never see the ones to blame. They're holed up in London or somewhere.<eos> They don't have to worry about rationing.<eos> It's always the little guy who gets shafted.<eos> Go on, son, eat.<eos> Wolf that rabbit down!<eos> Anyway, it's already dead.
- What I said, get rid of it. Kill it!<eos> - You can't order me to do that.<eos> - Like hell I can't.<eos> You've been told to keep out of this area.<eos> It killed the hen.<eos> I'm gonna kill it.<eos> The dog's mine to kill, an eye for an eye.<eos> Col. Foster, I have ordered Capt. Hawkins to destroy his dog.<eos> It's mine.<eos> I'm gonna kill it just like it killed my baby.
But no more than 10-20 million dead. Tops!<eos> Depending on the breaks...<eos> I won't go down in history as the next Hitler.<eos> Are you more concerned with the American people or with your image?<eos> General, I think I've heard sufficient from you, thank you.<eos> Mr. President, they have the ambassador waiting upstairs.<eos> - He's having a fit about the MP's.<eos> - Have him brought in straight away.<eos> Is that the Russian ambassador?<eos> Yes, it is.
- Now they'll give you another five years.<eos> - I was afraid of that, it's too big.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - We're gonna be married.<eos> - Married?<eos> - You want our child to be legitimate?<eos> - Why, yes, of course.<eos> - How is the baby?<eos> Full of mischief.<eos> Yesterday it kicked Coquette right off my lap.
Van, please.<eos> Anne, where are the flashlights?<eos> Am I going to make it?<eos> I mean, if all of us get away, uh...<eos> Okay, Mary, I understand.<eos> I'm the guy with all the answers.<eos> There is nothing to do but wait now, nothing to do but see if the beast will reach us through the center hatch.<eos> We can go no higher.<eos> We are in the top level of the ship.<eos> This is where either we die, or it dies.
It's very polite, but it boils down to:<eos> "Goodbye, and don't slam the door on your way out."<eos> - Where's Emmy's mother?<eos> - She touched Sylvia so she's out scrubbing up.<eos> City Morgue.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> They hung up.<eos> There you are.<eos> The complete history of the American buffalo.<eos> It, too, is becoming extinct.
They may have a couple of squads. That's what it sounded like this morning.<eos> - Maybe they're some of our friends.<eos> - That's the Third Battalion.<eos> Anyway, right now we have no friends.<eos> Why kid yourself?<eos> We're not going to get out of this.<eos> Maybe you're not, but I am.<eos> I'll guarantee you of that.<eos> You see that cockroach?<eos> Tomorrow morning, we'll be dead and it'll be alive.

See?<eos> When they realize what has happened his article will be alread printed. He'll be the first.<eos> It will be an exclusive!
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I remember.<eos> You probably think I'm silly, don't you, Margaret, carrying this glass around?<eos> Honey, what you do outside of office hours is your own business.<eos> You know, I didn't say anything to you while--<eos> Don't pretend you didn't want to.<eos> Well, it's all over now.<eos> Yes, I haven't had a drink in four weeks... two days and six hours.<eos> And it's still just a piece of glass.
He's scared.<eos> Things are going on around here that he don't like.<eos> One of these days we're going to high sail her down here.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> We've got a gold strike on the other side of the hill.<eos> Not much use of that stuff now, Pete.<eos> No use, eh?<eos> huh, you aint' got it right, Ruby.<eos> All my life I've been hunting for gold.<eos> and now that I've found it, It's up there and I'm down here.

I shall have to have templates made and get the pieces cut out for you.<eos> Well, just as you wish.<eos> I suppose you wouldn't prefer us to cut them out?<eos> Oh, I'm afraid you wouldn't be able to.<eos> Come in.<eos> - Well, what's funny about it?<eos> - It's just the suit. It looks as if it's wearing you.
He's not a Nazi.<eos> He's not one of those people.<eos> Leave us alone.<eos> She has the facts now.<eos> But she won't accept them.<eos> They're too horrible for her to acknowledge.<eos> Not so much that Rankin could be Kindler, but that she could ever have given her love to such a creature.<eos> But we have one ally.<eos> Her subconscious.<eos> It knows what the truth is and is struggling to be heard.
Well, what do you say?<eos> You just made a deal. -Okay, I'll pick you up at 7.:00.<eos> -7.:00.<eos> After supper.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Don't you dare. Don't you dare leave your baby here.<eos> Oh, I'm not the mother.<eos> There isn't any mother.<eos> They'll take good care of it here.<eos> It's such a wonderful baby.
Now, first, I'm gonna give you an anesthetic.<eos> Well, what for?<eos> It'll effect a temporary release of any inhibitions.<eos> It's not a cure, but I can get an idea of what's wrong with you.<eos> But is an anesthetic necessary?<eos> It's the simplest way.<eos> The effect will wear off in an hour or so. And meanwhile I can talk to you.<eos> If you want to talk to me, why put me to sleep?<eos> I'm going to talk to your subconscious mind.<eos> It never sleeps.
