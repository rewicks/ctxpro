What's happening?<eos> You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.<eos> I can't wait to see where this is headed.<eos> When you discovered your husband was cheating, you took away the one thing that mattered most to him.<eos> His partner in crime.<eos> Now, how do you think he dealt with that?<eos> Do you recognize any of these women?<eos> How many times are we gonna go through this?<eos> No, I do not.
I don't play anymore.<eos> You play every day.<eos> You just don't do it on a chessboard.<eos> The only game I'm playing right now is "catch a killer."<eos> And I need your help.<eos> This is a list of chess moves.<eos> I need to know what move comes next.<eos> You already know it.<eos> In here.<eos> I really don't.
I'm sorry that you didn't get it.<eos> I know that I apologized already, but I didn't know how personal this was for you; what that gem does.<eos> Well, you felt tied to it because of your, your family, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> But a 200-year-old relative versus something that has present-day power over you-- I think that you win.<eos> You know what, tell me this:<eos> why would someone want a gem that controls beasts unless they already have, or they're creating, ones exactly like Tori and me?<eos> You have to get it back.<eos> No.<eos> We do.
This isn't in the script.<eos> I'm talking about your dad, DJ.<eos> He sent me here with a message.<eos> He said he can't believe he was so selfish.<eos> It's like you held a mirror up to him and he could finally see how poorly he'd been treating you.<eos> He didn't realize how lucky he was...<eos> Stay on me, camera one.<eos> ...to have you back in his life, and now he feels like he's lost you all over again.<eos> But how do I know he won't just hurt me again?<eos> You don't.
Post is so uncool.<eos> Yöu'll never get a job if yöu send a letter in this day and age.<eos> Email sir, email.<eos> Actually, the real problem is that I don't know how to use a laptop.<eos> Not a big deal sir, it works just like a computer.<eos> I don't even know how to use computers!<eos> Yöu don't know to use the computer?<eos> I don't Ok...<eos> Do yöu know to make chicken biryani?<eos> Yöu don't, right?
I bet it's really fancy, like Beauty and the Beast fancy.<eos> No, it's probably just an empty, white cube with a USB port in it for him to plug his finger in when he's on sleep mode.<eos> Apparently, my husband Kevin has invited you all to my party.<eos> There is very little street parking, no gifts, no singing of Happy Birthday.<eos> Should be fun.<eos> Sounds fantastic.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> His husband invited us, not him.<eos> He so doesn't want us there.<eos> Yes, he does.
And it shows.<eos> I can't wait to meet Kevin.<eos> I assume he's the fun one in the relationship.<eos> I'm not sure you and Kevin will get along.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I disagree.<eos> In fact, I will guarantee you that by the end of the night,<eos> Kev and I will be best friends.<eos> He hates being called "Kev."<eos> Or does he?
I give Riley an allowance because she does chores.<eos> - What do you do?<eos> - You're lookin' at it.<eos> Okay, here is a nickel.<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> What do you think you're worth, Auggie?<eos> I think I'm worth $3.49 plus tax.<eos> Well, that sounds like the price of something.<eos> And you know that somebody's birthday is coming up, don't you?<eos> Maybe I do.
- She followed us.<eos> Evelyn rand.<eos> You know crazy hat?<eos> I know she's the chairman of the board of rand industries.<eos> You guys walk by her building on the way to school.<eos> - She really has a building?<eos> - With her name on it.<eos> (Chuckling) You'll usually find me on the top floor of my building going, "rahr rahr rah!"<eos> You two dollies want to know how I got my name on the building?<eos> I do!
Take it from me.<eos> (Speaks Dutch)<eos> And, you two, don't worry so much about your future.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really, yes.<eos> You two dollies, you're going to be just fine.<eos> Mm-hmm, now here, here's your first umbrella.<eos> Nice, nice work, dad.<eos> You really think that you can make a difference in these kids' lives?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Minutes.<eos> Representative!<eos> What is this?<eos> Farkle's never missed a class in his life.<eos> Yes?<eos> Everybody's getting an award but me.<eos> What good is having you as my teacher if the fix ain't in? !<eos> I'm sorry, Riley.<eos> Riley, you don't need a trophy to make you feel good about yourself.<eos> Yes, I do.
Why are you asking me that?<eos> Because I think he kidnapped you.<eos> No.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> He saved me.<eos> I owe him my life.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't owe him anything.<eos> Your life is yours, not his.<eos> Oh, I do.
Because I think he kidnapped you.<eos> No.<eos> It's not like that.<eos> He saved me.<eos> I owe him my life.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't owe him anything.<eos> Your life is yours, not his.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> I do.
Nobody's saying you are.<eos> Okay, look, relationships are complicated.<eos> I understand.<eos> When we bought this house, we were gonna fix it up and make it perfect and grow old together.<eos> And then we just couldn't agree on anything.<eos> Well, then, I hope the open house goes well, 'cause it sounds to me like it's best for both of you once you move on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've been horrible, haven't I?<eos> He drives me crazy, but I don't want to see him suffer.<eos> I don't.
The markers won't show in her blood until her next attack.<eos> So you're saying you want me to sit around and wait for her to have a potentially fatal crisis?<eos> That's right.<eos> High-stakes game of chicken.<eos> My money's on you.<eos> I don't think you're cardiac material, but you have improved leaps and bounds as a surgeon, Alex.<eos> Okay, perfect fit.<eos> Like a 6-4-3 double play.<eos> I didn't know you liked baseball.<eos> Oh, I don't.
Ever since he got the part, I just want to beat him at something, you know?<eos> Which is why you agreed to somersault over stationary vehicles?<eos> I just keep thinking to myself, you know, like,<eos> "what does he have that I don't have?"<eos> You ever have that with anybody?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Medicine can be a competitive field sometimes, yeah.<eos> Hmm. Can I do my piece for you?<eos> Your piece?<eos> What do you...
Just shut up!<eos> I've had just about enough of you running your mouth.<eos> The Bash Brothers... Conseco and McGuire... Were genetically engineered super soldiers...<eos> Just shut it!<eos> You are playing the quiet game for the rest of the flight.<eos> Here.<eos> Let me check it.<eos> Come on!<eos> Yeah. You like to play rough?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You're always telling me to eat more greens.<eos> This will disguise the taste of brussels sprouts.<eos> Come on.<eos> I liked this place better when they covered everything<eos> - in salt and grease.<eos> - I think I like Maura.<eos> - You can't like Maura.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because it's Maura, that's why.<eos> - You did.
Wait, wait, wait, what ...<eos> what prime business hours?<eos> When the suits got hungry.<eos> Reed said they was trying to hook a whale or something.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - The hell if I know.<eos> Book him for assault and battery.<eos> Come on.<eos> You don't want to do that.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
They let me watch news, and I'm assuming that you're here to talk about the murder of that young girl. Looks like you got a copycat.<eos> Who you been talking to, Costa?<eos> I never killed anyone.<eos> How could I be copied? Right.<eos> Someone else killed those people, cut out their organs and put their DNA all over you?<eos> Before my medications, I would, uh, have blackouts. I'd lose time.<eos> They said I did it, but in my heart, I know I didn't.<eos> After the fifth appeal, I gave up.<eos> You finally figured out no one believes you?<eos> Someone did.
Hope you like it.<eos> Listen...<eos> I know I'm not human, and I could never be what Pelham was to you.<eos> - Hey, Dorian...<eos> - I get it. I really do.<eos> But I'm glad Maldonado put us together.<eos> Am I really the reason that you want to stay on the force?<eos> I... uh, no, I never said that.<eos> To the interviewer you did.<eos> Um, no, no, I didn't.
Here uninvited...<eos> You must have stayed too long with the Indians.<eos> It's made you more... savage.<eos> No.<eos> Less patient.<eos> There's something I think you should know.<eos> - You're leaving Salem?<eos> - To the contrary.<eos> Anne Hale reminded me Salem deserves better.<eos> It always did.
Yuasa<eos> Tell me, how's Naoya been lately?<eos> We're not close. I don't know.<eos> Prior to the incident, you were seen with Naoya at a park.<eos> I bumped into him on my way home.<eos> There was nothing special.<eos> Then...<eos> You don't know he hurt his leg at the park?<eos> He hurt it that day.<eos> No, I don't.
Now, about the reception...<eos> Are you allergic to doves?<eos> Imagine if her ex was Ryan Phillippe.<eos> Milo?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Oh. Hey.<eos> You know, just wanted to see what you do.<eos> Always wondered how candles got made.<eos> Well... now you know.<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
So, I guess this messes up your green card.<eos> Oh, please...<eos> You really think you're the only guy I can get to fake-marry me?<eos> Are you mad at me?<eos> Honestly, I'm a little relieved.<eos> You were starting to freak me out with all your cake-tasting and seating charts.<eos> So, we're good?<eos> Same old us?<eos> Do you promise to stop measuring me in my sleep?<eos> I do.
Allow me, boss.<eos> Okay.<eos> Big Steamer Magazine.<eos> That's not what it's called.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, the asshole hung up.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, no, he didn't.
No, no, no, nobody hired anybody, all right?<eos> He's just a nice old man who's clearly a little lonely.<eos> He returned my bag, so I thought I should pay it forward.<eos> You might want to look backwards.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Uh, Bob?<eos> I think your coffee machine's broken.<eos> How did your book meeting go?<eos> Yeah, does Bridget Ellis really want to publish your novel?<eos> Yes, she does.
Boob!<eos> Ohh. How many boobs have we seen?<eos> 17.<eos> 17?<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Well, I'm like a titty rain man.<eos> So, you plan this event for your friends, and they didn't even bother to show up?<eos> Yeah, I've become the odd man out ever since I quit.<eos> They've got inside jokes, they go do stuff without me, and now that Tyler and Jude are sleeping together,<eos> - I don't even...
In the history of great ideas, there's, like, fire, wheel, this, then everything bagels.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This is so exciting.<eos> You will not be sorry, boss, or significantly taller boss.<eos> Consider your books kept.<eos> Super excited.<eos> Ow! What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> You offered my ex-wife a job?<eos> I thought you wanted her to have a job.<eos> I do, in a pet store, in a dentist's office, or in Miami.
And the wine.<eos> Yes, and the wine.<eos> I should go.<eos> Thank you for what you did yesterday for me and my brother.<eos> It was brave and incredibly gallant.<eos> And I'm so sorry to have imposed on you.<eos> It was no imposition.<eos> Truly, it was nice to spend time with someone who I... didn't have to hide from.<eos> I'm sorry; you don't want to hear this.<eos> Yes, I do.
Don't come any closer!<eos> Clarissa, please, you don't want to hurt Charles.<eos> He's your friend.<eos> He's my brother.<eos> But I never knew.<eos> 'Cause she never told me.<eos> She didn't want me.<eos> She hated me!<eos> No.<eos> She didn't.
!<eos> What kind of person does that?<eos> The kind who's empty, who believes that a ship can fill a void left by a broken heart.<eos> And that makes it okay? !<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> I would give anything to take it back, to make things right.<eos> Anything?<eos> Yes... anything.<eos> How am I supposed to trust a man who no longer believes in love?<eos> I still do.
I brought you a dress for the party tonight.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> You might as well enjoy yourself, because I've made arrangements to check you in to a nursing home tomorrow.<eos> You can't make me go.<eos> I won't let you.<eos> I am through taking orders from you.<eos> I make the rules in this house now.<eos> You couldn't survive without me.<eos> You don't know what I could do.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
So, do you miss her?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I mean, she's the only one for me.<eos> I mean, she's the one who brings me up when I'm down...<eos> Whoa. Hello, future Mrs. Strongman.<eos> So, what are you afraid of?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's just such a big commitment.<eos> Bottom line: do you still love her?<eos> Yes, I do.
I am.<eos> James?<eos> Where were you?<eos> Half the world away.<eos> Scotland.<eos> Come.<eos> My lord, are the mechanisms ready?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, I thought for a moment you'd said, "no."<eos> I did.
Half the world away.<eos> Scotland.<eos> Come.<eos> My lord, are the mechanisms ready?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, I thought for a moment you'd said, "no."<eos> I did.<eos> I think I did.<eos> I intended to, certainly.<eos> Indeed you did.
Once or twice.<eos> I've been round awhile and seen most things.<eos> What gives rise to it, do you think?<eos> Some science, I expect.<eos> An old legend claims it gives a man's power to read another man's soul.<eos> Well, I heard it had something to do with the souls of the drowned or with luck or money;<eos> I forget which.<eos> One of the usual.<eos> You don't believe in the signs and portents?<eos> Never did.
I was detained while pursuing matters that required my attention.<eos> Those matters being? - A visit.<eos> - To?<eos> William Jagger.<eos> To what purpose?<eos> Murdering him.<eos> And why would a sane man attempt that?<eos> Because of what he did to Kate Balfour and because of what you told me he'd do to this island, Commodore, if given the opportunity.<eos> And did you succeed?<eos> I did not.
Marry me.<eos> How many times have you asked?<eos> 100,000?<eos> Then ask again.<eos> Marry me.<eos> And once again.<eos> Marry me.<eos> I should be honored.<eos> When did you know me?<eos> I didn't, not for sure.
That's all you want from me now, my ear?<eos> I've come to express my contrition.<eos> Oh, for what?<eos> Well, much as I'd like to imagine the event had passed from your memory... oh, it's not forgotten, Tom.<eos> But you may consider it disregarded.<eos> This is a violent place.<eos> Think no more of it.<eos> Still, it wasn't my intention to add to the sum of that violence, and for that, I beg your forgiveness.<eos> You don't need my forgiveness.<eos> I very much do.
Leave him alone!<eos> Mr. Fletch, run!<eos> - I can't!<eos> - Get to safety!<eos> You must run!<eos> You know he's innocent of this.<eos> You read the letter.<eos> You know he's innocent.<eos> You know it.<eos> You did.
- I have.<eos> How was I supposed to know she'd be there.<eos> Why are you trying to make trouble for me?<eos> Sally Ann now thinks that I attacked you that night in the study.<eos> You did.<eos> She thinks I raped you.<eos> She thinks we've been having an affair for months.<eos> Where did she get that idea?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes you do.
Every detail of his life needs to be established, checked and double-checked.<eos> I also believe that Paul Spector is responsible for the deaths of Fiona Gallagher, Alice Monroe and Sarah Kay.<eos> I'd say all of his previous victims were dead within an hour of being attacked.<eos> So she's lost to us already?<eos> The one glimmer of hope is that he knows Rose.<eos> Not from watching and stalking, objectifying her.<eos> He really knows her.<eos> And she's a mother.<eos> "I feel sorry for you.<eos> I really do.

There are people who saw me.<eos> There's CCTV along the way.<eos> So if they check up they'll see it's true.<eos> Are you pleased with me?<eos> Not particularly.<eos> Why are you being like this?<eos> Like what?<eos> I'm protecting you.<eos> I don't need your protection.<eos> Yes you do.
Your father was decapitated in a motorcycle accident.<eos> Or have you forgotten?<eos> No, I haven't forgotten.<eos> It's OK.<eos> My mother killed herself when I was seven.<eos> Left me alone and unwanted.<eos> There's suffering all around us.<eos> Why not take some pleasure from it?<eos> I don't know how to get pleasure from suffering.<eos> Yes, you do.
They want to make us their digital slaves.<eos> Are we gonna let them?<eos> Hell, no!<eos> Time to occupy Hester.<eos> Man your stations!<eos> Stop Skwerkel!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Liam's really into this protest, so I'm gonna be the protestiest protester who ever protested.<eos> - Wanna help?<eos> - No. I don't.
Okay, moving on.<eos> Internet dating is a numbers game.<eos> Let's get back on the horse.<eos> I don't want to meet another girl.<eos> A boy?<eos> I don't want to meet another boy.<eos> That limits your options.<eos> It won't make these feelings for Karma go away.<eos> Well, then at least we know what you are.<eos> We do?
Not much to see.<eos> Just restaurant stuff.<eos> So, look, this isn't about that little incident last year, is it?<eos> 'Cause, I mean, it's legal now in Maine, you know, even without a prescription.<eos> Move this for me.<eos> Come on, let's see those muscles.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> I don't see anything.<eos> You wouldn't know what to look for.<eos> People rarely do.
When I first heard I'd be working for Gordon Clark, I wasn't sure he even knew his way around a motherboard.<eos> Well, I've been proven wrong a hundred times over, and, today, my respect for this guy has been taken to a whole new level.<eos> To Gordo, for kicking ass and taking names.<eos> To Gordo.<eos> Thanks, Gordon.<eos> Good job, buddy.<eos> Hey, I see you told them the good news about the LCD screen.<eos> Yeah, everyone's excited.<eos> Good, I thought maybe you didn't get my message.<eos> No, I did.
He deserves it-- everything he sacrificed for you-know-who.<eos> Wait, what do I get for my sacrifice?<eos> Curled toes.<eos> So, Gabe, I hear you're leaving.<eos> I'm going to try one of your canapes.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Weren't you going to tell me?<eos> Of course I was.<eos> I just, um... I didn't, because... I didn't want you to think that it had anything to do with us.<eos> It doesn't?
"Oh, you fancy a cranberry muffin, sir?"<eos> Forget about shiatsu.<eos> I'll take he-atsu any day.<eos> I've never been so relaxed.<eos> Sorry about those farts.<eos> Sir, that's a compliment.<eos> Like an Arab burping after a meal.<eos> Speaking of which, your complimentary breakfast will be here shortly.<eos> But we didn't order it.<eos> Oh, I did.
Go on, you know I love them sexy stories. Mm. Ah.<eos> It's for you, Big Daddy.<eos> Who is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's a girl and she sounds kinda cute.<eos> You better not be fucking around on me.<eos> You're more woman than I can take, Jenny.<eos> You know that.<eos> I do.
Yeah, I suppose I am.<eos> All right, folks, it's gonna be all right.<eos> We gots to keep moving, though.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - We've come this far and we're almost...<eos> Well, well, look who we have here.<eos> You had no right to kill that man.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> - You had no goddamn right.<eos> - Oh, actually, I do.
Hoyt?<eos> He's where? - At the BBG.<eos> - He's acting like he doesn't even know you.<eos> - Yeah, that's because he doesn't.<eos> Listen, Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?<eos> - I'm on my way.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So... -...should I use this on you?<eos> - Uh... How much does it say to use? Um...<eos> It doesn't.
- Fuck.<eos> ...how she and Hoyt used to go together.<eos> And, I don't know, the whole thing just became a big mess.<eos> Well, saddle up, Brigette, 'cause things are about to get a whole lot messier when I get there.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Well, what are y'all having?<eos> Etouffé and dirty rice.<eos> - I don't like dirty rice.<eos> - Shut up, honey.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- Yeah, yeah, it was.<eos> Sookie.<eos> Eric?<eos> Can we talk?<eos> It's okay.<eos> You guys can go.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I went to Bill's tonight.<eos> You did?
What in the world's all this?<eos> Oh, it ain't nothing.<eos> Got it all from the 99 Cents Store.<eos> Well, that don't look like no 99-cent cake to me.<eos> No, but I bought it with my own money.<eos> That don't taste like no 99-cent cake neither.<eos> Y'all run on home now.<eos> Tara's daddy just needs a little quiet time.<eos> - You hide my daughter's birthday from me?<eos> - I didn't. - I just-
I think so.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Thank you, Reverend Daniels.<eos> Any time.<eos> I know it's not my place, but you want some advice about that sermon?<eos> Honey, I'll take advice wherever I can find it.<eos> Tell them help is on its way.<eos> Tell them it will all be over soon.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
Did she escape from an asylum?<eos> Or from the Island of Dr. Moreau?<eos> Was she half cheetah?<eos> Am I half cheetah?<eos> Will someone get her a coffee?<eos> One coffee, coming up.<eos> Why wouldn't she love me?<eos> Oh, who knows?<eos> Sometimes you never find out why something didn't work out.<eos> It just didn't.
I just fired her.<eos> Wow. L-Look, this is more than just a condiment.<eos> A condiment is something that you throw on a meal at the last minute; it's an afterthought.<eos> Satan's Tongue is the main event.<eos> It's more like a meal replacement.<eos> I had one for breakfast, one for lunch, and then a sensible dinner.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna do something that I don't normally do.<eos> I'm gonna take off my sunglasses and I'm gonna really listen.<eos> This sauce of yours, does it have a story?<eos> It actually does.
LAUREN: Hey, Andrew, you did it.<eos> You totally fixed Allie.<eos> I mean, she is completely over you.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Were you just, like, a total jerk to her?<eos> Oh, no, that was a terrible plan.<eos> It was never gonna be followed.<eos> No, but thank you guys for forcing me to go out with her again.<eos> You know, it's generally against my nature to second-guess my snap judgments, but turns out I kind of like her.<eos> You do?
You want to make small talk like Timothy and I do before NCIS starts, at which point a cone of silence is triggered?<eos> Hey, Gordon, how about we throw caution to the wind tonight, okay? Have a little party?<eos> I've got some new neighbors I want you to meet.<eos> Oh, no, no. No, I can't meet anybody I don't know already.<eos> What was Timothy's number one complaint?<eos> - Well... well, that's 'cause I need to research people before I meet them.<eos> M...<eos> You know, come on. Oh, they're here.<eos> Surprise! - No time for research, got to improvise.<eos> - No, no, Simon. - What did you do?
(Lauren gasps) What do you think?<eos> "Vote to close the library April 17th.<eos> Book burning celebration to follow."<eos> Yep.<eos> Ha! Well, it's...<eos> Book burning generally has a sort of negative connotation.<eos> True.<eos> Well, uh, the font's pretty.<eos> I love it.<eos> No, you don't, but kudos on ass-kissing.
- Except Allie.<eos> Right!<eos> No, right, right.<eos> Except Allie, of course, who's great; she's great.<eos> She's really great.<eos> So, yeah, except for that.<eos> - That's great.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I miss hanging out with you.<eos> You do?
- Yeah, we do.<eos> - You're the Beast to my Beauty.<eos> - Oh. - The Garfunkel to my Simon.<eos> See?<eos> That works on two levels because my name is Simon...<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.<eos> Very clever.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - But no one really ever appreciated Garfunkel.<eos> - Well, Simon did.
- Studying for what?<eos> - For the S.A.T.s.<eos> That test is in November.<eos> - Something to drink?<eos> - Surprise me.<eos> Something stiff.<eos> You know, your father and I aren't morons.<eos> We know what it looks like when someone's been smoking pot.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> First of all, no you don't.
Because the $5 million you're not getting pays for my silence.<eos> "Silence"?<eos> For what?<eos> We both know I didn't do this.<eos> No.<eos> You did.<eos> Rumor on the streets is, you're still angry you didn't get the fishscale rights from the metas, so you took out your anger on my supplier.<eos> Are you still upset that we wouldn't move your product?<eos> How do I know you're not setting me up?<eos> You don't.
- Uh, where?<eos> - Just here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not too hard.<eos> That worked.<eos> Not easy figuring out how to be a mother.<eos> Do you have children?<eos> My sister did.
It is imperative that you find them immediately.<eos> I don't care who you have to bribe, threaten, or kill.<eos> Any questions?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Danilov failed us.<eos> I won't.<eos> Find that child.<eos> Not easy figuring out how to be a mother.<eos> - Do you have children?<eos> - My sister did.
Not if I don't have to.<eos> You have to let me talk to him first.<eos> And how is that gonna go?<eos> "You're a half-Royal, bastard Zauberbiest,<eos> "and your little girlfriend there is a hexenbiest, and I am a Grimm, so give me the baby."<eos> That's gonna go over really well.<eos> Well, I don't expect it to be easy.<eos> Nick, I'm sorry I brought you back into this.<eos> If I'd known that the...<eos> You didn't.
Blood sacrifice is-- is nothing new to this community, Robert.<eos> I know, but... she was a friend to me.<eos> She helped me when I first came to Korban.<eos> She-- she stood beside me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Carla was a... very special woman.<eos> That's why she was chosen to go home.<eos> Do you really believe that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do very much.
Right.<eos> So, the last person we believe to have seen Natasha, they each drank a glass of champagne before he, Adam Frost, returned to his room shortly after two.<eos> And he lied at first. He didn't tell us about visiting Natasha.<eos> Because he knew how it would look to Helen.<eos> Although he doesn't appear to have any reason at all to kill Natasha.<eos> Next we have First Officer Paul Bevans.<eos> Under pressure to repay a 10,000 euro debt to Natasha.<eos> Boy, that's a lot of money.<eos> Although he has the money to pay her back.<eos> He did today.
You were on a flight en route to Saint-Marie when the murder took place.<eos> Which brings us rather neatly onto opportunity.<eos> Who had the opportunity?<eos> The spare key to Natasha's room went missing.<eos> Now, any one of you could have stolen it from reception.<eos> Except me.<eos> But that...<eos> But that doesn't tell us how the poison was administered.<eos> You see, when we searched that room, we couldn't find anything containing the poison.<eos> And yet, today, strangely enough, we did.
So he stands up to him and says, no more.<eos> They're threatened, think he might talk, so they kill him.<eos> That's good.<eos> It's very good.<eos> Well, too bad it's not supported by fact.<eos> Look for any more defensive wounds.<eos> If he was fighting for his life, there must be more evidence of it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, I'm surprised you want an opinion from a psychologist.<eos> I don't.
Well, you don't have to worry about her anymore.<eos> I'm getting you out of here.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> She won't let me.<eos> Whenever I try to leave, she... [whoosh]<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It's too late.<eos> She must know you're here.<eos> Now, you've already gone through labor once, so at least you know what to expect. Oh, yes.<eos> We both do.
- It's a nice pattern.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> - But it's cool.<eos> It's not cool.<eos> It's too flashy.<eos> Detectives don't wear a jacket like this.<eos> Wait a minute. You aren't talking to me politely.<eos> - Rule number two...<eos> - It doesn't matter when I'm off duty.<eos> - It does.

Congratulations. Wow!<eos> Oh, my God! You guys, do you know what this means?<eos> All of us... we're all going to New York together!<eos> You guys, we're gonna miss our shift!<eos> Oh. Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> If I wanted to watch men in capri pants slobbering all over each other, I'd watch Monday Night Football.<eos> Whoa! Man, those ten flights of stairs are a bitch.<eos> I wish this apartment had an elevator.<eos> It does.
Growing up, all our dogs could use the toilet.<eos> Then why is your aim so pathetic?<eos> Hey.<eos> Dinner's just about ready.<eos> Why is there a bumper in the...<eos> Oh, did someone try and teach Mom how to drive?<eos> Yes, but for no reason.<eos> I get by fine.<eos> I don't need to learn to drive.<eos> Uh, yeah, you do.
No.<eos> - What's the situation with Graeme?<eos> - He's a cabbage in a polar fleece.<eos> - What's he doing for work?<eos> - I don't fuckin' know.<eos> He's around here somewhere.<eos> Why don't you go and ask him?<eos> What about your real father?<eos> Miriam says he runs a boat brokerage on the Gold Coast.<eos> Done quite well for himself.
How much is it?<eos> $13... $26 for two<eos> Thanks<eos> I'm heading for Mei Foo now<eos> I won't go back to Tai Po tonight<eos> I can't...<eos> Why not?<eos> I thought we had a date?<eos> We did, but I didn't know... I'd have my period today<eos> So what if you do?
Hello, it's really noisy here<eos> Hello?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> I'm heading for Mei Foo now<eos> I won't go back to Tai Po tonight<eos> I can't...<eos> Why not?<eos> I thought we had a date?<eos> We did, but I didn't know... I'd have my period today<eos> So what if you do?
Someone else's turn, right?<eos> You look like you've seen a lot<eos> You played football, you were in a gang You're the right man<eos> You're bringing up my past?<eos> Never mind the past, let's deal with now<eos> A real man can make breakfast<eos> At this solemn moment... we need a real leader<eos> Come on, boss<eos> When did I say I was the boss?<eos> You did!
If it bothers you, you should say something to him.<eos> To what end?<eos> The man has chosen vanity and the pursuit of the spotlight.<eos> Nothing I say is going to change that.<eos> It's not about changing him.<eos> It's about putting it out there, so you can focus on finding Aurelius, instead of watching Lestrade yammer.<eos> When we first ran into him, you said that you expected him to crash and burn without you.<eos> Did you?<eos> I didn't give it much thought. Oh.<eos> Yes, of course I did.
We think one of your executives may have been targeted.<eos> How did Lawrence Iver fit into the hierarchy here?<eos> Larry?<eos> He was an ace.<eos> He made our clients a boatload trading distressed debt.<eos> Came here to the mother ship five years ago.<eos> He had been on the commodities desk ever since.<eos> Did he have any enemies at the company?<eos> I guess.<eos> We all do.
Holmes!<eos> Your bloody rooster is at it again!<eos> 19 days.<eos> 19 days he has been here.<eos> Well, you were the one who said he could stay with us until he figured out his next move.<eos> Holmes!<eos> I'll pluck it!<eos> I swear it!<eos> He has offers, remember?<eos> Course he does.
I don't know...<eos> Last night, I was wondering how those ears could be a genetic match for strands of hair on a brush taken from your bathroom.<eos> You said the brush was not yours.<eos> And yet those ears, identical to your own, and as I've already said, the DNA's a match.<eos> Then it occurred to me, you lied when you said the brush belonged to someone else.<eos> It was yours. The ears are yours, too, right?<eos> It's just they didn't come from your head.<eos> You realize how crazy this all sounds?<eos> People thought Dr. Charles Vacanti was crazy when he grew what looked like a human ear on the back of a lab mouse in 1997.<eos> I, myself, did not.
From what I can infer from the Internet, they may be as much as one year behind in the race.<eos> Come on.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You seem hyper.<eos> I may have had a coffee or three with my tea this morning.<eos> Are you joking about this?<eos> Two lives have been taken, a third is on the verge of ruination.<eos> It's not really a joking matter.<eos> You do admit you know about Hank Prince and the two murders?<eos> Of course, I do.
It's all perfectly normal.<eos> Oh, my god, she has so much hair now.<eos> Come.<eos> Come inside.<eos> Come on in.<eos> You're back.<eos> That's my pool you're polluting.<eos> It's your pool? Mm-hmm. You don't remember me, do you?<eos> Sure.<eos> No, you don't.
I will be blamed for the riots.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> It's because it was my video, And it's my face on it.<eos> Also, people are watching me now.<eos> No one is watching you.<eos> Who's that guy?<eos> That's a teaching fellow.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Last night... Uh, you... Were...<eos> Moaning. Not during, but, um... After, while you were sleeping.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Really?<eos> Honestly, it's... Been kind of a rough week.<eos> It's been a very rough week.<eos> Do you want to tell me about it?<eos> I do.
They're playing my favorite mariachi song.<eos> Well, you know, who doesn't love No Vale La Pena?<eos> Most of the English-speaking world.<eos> Well, I'm not most of the English-speaking world.<eos> I'm just a guy who loves margaritas and good mariachi bands.<eos> So... Here's to common interests.<eos> Or as they say in Oaxaca... Salud!<eos> You googled me.<eos> Oh, uh, no, I did not.<eos> I did.
This train is moving, understand?<eos> I do, but is everyone we need still on the train?<eos> - Hell yes.<eos> - Even Judge Harris?<eos> We heard he missed a few days of work last week.<eos> Didn't tell anybody.<eos> Heard how they found him yesterday too.<eos> The man's son shot himself in the head.<eos> If he had a few bad days, I think he gets a pass.<eos> Of course he does.
Finally had time to do all the things we normally couldn't.<eos> Like what?<eos> Go to the park, see a movie, go to the zoo, just do nothing.<eos> Life was good... really good.<eos> It didn't get lonely?<eos> Just the two of you?<eos> Henry had tons of friends at school, and I... had someone.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Why are you sorry?<eos> Of course you did.
This is about my dad?<eos> Some bad people wanted to hurt him.<eos> Is he okay?<eos> Did you find him?<eos> I found him... but I was too late.<eos> He's gone, Henry.<eos> He was a good man, and he would have been a great father.<eos> There's one thing I need you to know about him... he was a hero.<eos> I wish I would have known him.<eos> You did.
Thank you.<eos> What is it?<eos> Someone has connections on high.<eos> I wonder... what ward you might be going to!<eos> Let me guess.<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> He likes you too.<eos> Really?<eos> Do you think so?<eos> No, he doesn't!
It's left me with a rattle, but it's...<eos> It sounds much worse than it is, it's nothing, honest.<eos> Breathe in.<eos> How did you get through your medical?<eos> Shoved a half crown across table.<eos> Hey, no, no, don't.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Don't tell him, let it be just between me and you.<eos> It's just a rattle, it don't mean anything, it don't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
Copy that.<eos> Ohh. Remind me to call my shoemaker.<eos> I'm gonna need a new pair of boots.<eos> You have a shoemaker?<eos> Well, one thing I've learned in life-- a good pair of shoes can last longer than a marriage.<eos> You only have to pay for them once.<eos> Sir, we're with the FBI.<eos> We're looking for information on these people.<eos> Do you recognize any of them?<eos> No, I don't.
Well, we're broke.<eos> Wish we could help you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Doesn't hurt to ask.<eos> If anyone wants to stop by, give his morale a boost. Hope can heal.<eos> Can hope make up for the years of misery that he put us through?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Come by. Find out.<eos> He doesn't deserve to go out like this.<eos> No one does.
Mama says we can go to Ruby Tuesday's when you wake up.<eos> Hi.<eos> Good morning.<eos> I'm Emily.<eos> I need a new heart.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> What's wrong with yours?<eos> Hey, don't be rude.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Don't you "Oh, my God" me, mister.
I see you've met my stepbrother, Henry.<eos> Stepbrother?<eos> Why would you do this to me?<eos> Seema gave me 50 bucks.<eos> - I call dibs on the remote!<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - I want to watch Steve Harvey!<eos> - I call... I was here first.<eos> - That doesn't matter.<eos> - Yes, it does.

It is the two loving people who stand-- and lie-- before us.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Last time I was here, I thought I was so different from everyone else waiting.<eos> In my office ensemble.<eos> Now I fit right in.<eos> I know you have to study.<eos> I'll call you when I know what's happening.<eos> I can study here.<eos> Sheila, do you promise to love and cherish Frank in sickness and-- uh, I guess just in sickness, till death do you part?<eos> I do.

Skip the pharmacy.<eos> Just -- just borrow our lice kit.<eos> It's in the basement.<eos> The key's under the mat.<eos> Thank you, Phil.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right!<eos> Enough... with scary robot!<eos> But who wants to pretend to be a dog and ride in the car?<eos> I do!
It's forbidden.<eos> That doesn't make it hot.<eos> Oh, I got some on your face.<eos> You're gonna shine.<eos> I'll go get some of my...<eos> Claire's powder.<eos> My Claire.<eos> She's my wife.<eos> I thought you had a date to go on.<eos> I do.
You deserve better.<eos> I mean, not much better, but better.<eos> You know who I deserve?<eos> I deserve Lyndsey, but I can't have her.<eos> She's marrying somebody else, so I'm taking what I can get.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> I'm a love scavenger.<eos> You're also a house scavenger and a money scavenger and an underwear scavenger.<eos> But that doesn't mean you have to settle.<eos> Yes, it does.
- What work?<eos> - Cosmetic surgery.<eos> - Are you actually insane?<eos> - How can we even afford that?<eos> - You know last week, you said that I could only throw a teabag away after it had made three cups of tea.<eos> - So all week, I've been trying to save you money by drinking tea that looks and tastes like ass piss, and now, you wanna go and throw away thousands of pounds<eos> - No bloody way, mom.<eos> - Don't cry.<eos> - You were doing so well.<eos> - I do.
We also have Janek's phone.<eos> We don't have all the texts because some of them were erased.<eos> But that's just a matter of time.<eos> You can make it easy by explaining a few things.<eos> Do you realize that some of the texts you sent to Janek can be interpreted as you convincing him to commit a serious crime?<eos> If Janek did anything, he did it alone.<eos> There is a text, in which you write:<eos> "I can't stand that I have to look at this bitch.<eos> She'll rot in hell.<eos> Do it!"
We got pretty much everything we have at ho--at the house.<eos> Check it out.<eos> I got a couple of games we could try out this weekend.<eos> Cool.<eos> Syd.<eos> Here's that rainbow loom you have at home.<eos> I thought we could, uh, you know, go rainbow... Bracelet crazy this weekend.<eos> I don't play with that anymore.<eos> I'm ten now.<eos> You don't?
- Hey.<eos> Just let me know if you wanna come back to the world.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey. Is everything okay?<eos> Nora.<eos> Nora.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Look, she needs a spoon to eat.<eos> No, she doesn't.
- I have no idea.<eos> - Wait.<eos> It's been a while too.<eos> Her parents don't even know.<eos> I mean, that's weird.<eos> What she's saying is that I just make her happy and she just wants to be around me and all this stuff.<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> Her to leave and go back to school, you know?<eos> I love her.<eos> I-I do, but...
Music doc. Supposed to be amazing.<eos> And a bunch of other stuff I think you're gonna love.<eos> - Hey, Carl.<eos> - Bags.<eos> Do you-- where's your stuff?<eos> I can't go.<eos> What? huh? I know it sounds crazy.<eos> I'm sure I'll never have this chance again.<eos> But I was getting ready, and I looked in the bathroom mirror, and you know that sticker I have?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do.
I'm a normal kid.<eos> Like Maria Teresa?<eos> All we do is play.<eos> Have you binned the letters?<eos> - No, they're in a box.<eos> Fuck, what are you waiting for?<eos> The police? You have to burn the proof!<eos> Ist!<eos> I liked Ricky.<eos> What did you like?
You see, when Rumple saw that Neal was dying, he... absorbed him.<eos> And, uh, Zelena got ahold of the dagger.<eos> Now she controls Rumple.<eos> Maybe now isn't the time to announce the pregnancy.<eos> Regina is right.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> No, if... if we don't, we give in to fear.<eos> But if we do, we give the kingdom what they need... hope.<eos> We don't even know what this wicked witch wants.<eos> Actually, we do.
Swept away by the last curse.<eos> A book can't just disappear.<eos> But it can just appear.<eos> The first curse.<eos> It just showed up in my closet when I needed it...<eos> - or more accurately, when Henry needed it. - What do you mean?<eos> He was going through a rough time.<eos> He was realizing he had been given up.<eos> He didn't feel like he had a real family.<eos> He did.
I was there all night.<eos> Ask the barman, the bouncer.<eos> There was half a dozen guys there who'll back me up.<eos> I am telling you i did not kill her.<eos> I loved her.<eos> She was my girl.<eos> Come on, Hildy, DNA.<eos> You know what, mark?<eos> I actually believe you.<eos> You do?

Automatic send...<eos> On Android, anyway.<eos> And it's trackable on the phone?<eos> Apps can be uninstalled remotely from a browser.<eos> There would be a download history, but if you delete the app in your account and sync, you've wiped it.<eos> Permanently?<eos> If you know how.<eos> And this guy definitely knows how.<eos> At least you have a scenario.<eos> I do.
And you know he got in his best suit, shined up his shiny little shoes, and dangled a big-ass check in front of that family.<eos> What, $5 million?<eos> Plus punitive.<eos> So, what's the cut for Rodriguez?<eos> Probably 40%.<eos> Except there's no case there.<eos> He's working for zero, right?<eos> Well, unless Mulligan overreacted.<eos> - It happens.<eos> - It didn't.
Okay, let's get this in the oven, all right?<eos> - Take this.<eos> - Oven mitts.<eos> All right. Here we go.<eos> Three, two, one... Ta-da! I'm never gonna be a cop, mom.<eos> Just so you know.<eos> What do you say, D-Hop?<eos> The lawyer said I shouldn't talk to nobody without him.<eos> Okay, well, what if, uh...<eos> What if I do all the talking and you do the listening?
Can I help you?<eos> Hello, Mrs. DeMarco, I am Leslie Knope, and we saw your announcement in the newspaper and we would love to treat you and your husband to a very special day.<eos> All right.<eos> How much money did we win?<eos> Oh, no, you didn't win any money, you won something better than money.<eos> A golden anniversary celebration.<eos> So no money.<eos> No, and I'm now just realizing how misleading this giant check it.<eos> - Told you.<eos> - Yes, you did, Tom.
Just took some ludes to kind of smooth it out, so I'm right in that sweet spot.<eos> Got about 20 minutes before I either get really tired or really horny, so let's roll.<eos> Dougie, are you sure you want to go on television?<eos> You look like a leather glove got caught in a lawnmower.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I'm going to admit something.<eos> I orchestrated the Pawnee-Eagleton merger, and I was hoping that your marriage could show people that a happy union is possible.<eos> So when you're out there, if you could just, you know, look back over the past 50 years together and focus on the good times, okay?<eos> Donna, you wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, I did, troll.
- Of course I did.<eos> What's gonna happen?<eos> A vegan is gonna physically attack me?<eos> They're basically made of glass.<eos> But more importantly, if you believe in something, you sign your name to it.<eos> Which is why the makers of carbonated water will soon know exactly where to find me.<eos> Donna, Kyle did not write those things, okay?<eos> I did.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You do?
Are you kidding me?<eos> Dart guns.<eos> Couldn't hurt a...<eos> Whoa, hey!<eos> Watch the face there, buddy.<eos> Did you see that shot?<eos> What'd you bring presents for?<eos> They're busted!<eos> We have to meet with the principal in the morning. You didn't get my message?<eos> I did.
And his bastard got the message.<eos> You knew it was an armoured car, so why send me to machine gun it?<eos> Only dogs attack with no warning.<eos> I'm not a dog.<eos> I'm giving him a warning.<eos> Our friend Viktor has heard that the boss is dead.<eos> His sons will be on the next flight to Paris.<eos> Are you okay, Rox?<eos> - Do you mind if I go home?<eos> - Of course not, you do that.
ABKP has crossed the magical figure of 273.<eos> Abhimanyu Kaul has alone assured this victory.<eos> Looks like India is once again ready for its youngest prime minister.<eos> "Pleas are powerful."<eos> "For better or worse, we have our fate."<eos> "There is a wave in the sea.."<eos> - Abhi, you won.<eos> "That belongs to you."<eos> "There is a wave in the sea that belongs to us."<eos> We did.
What is wrong with you?<eos> I'm not paying for that.<eos> Bonnie: Oh my god, Ben, you are never gonna believe what happened yesterday.<eos> Your open house was a huge success and you rented your first listing?<eos> Or some idiot left a candle burning and lit the apartment up like a torch.<eos> Do they know who did it?<eos> - Not a clue.<eos> - Oh, that's a relief.<eos> I mean, I hate to think that they thought you were responsible.<eos> - They don't, do they?
- This one had on a white lab coat.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - Bus took him five minutes<eos> - before you got here.<eos> - Stop that ambulance so I can get to him.<eos> Agent Finley?<eos> I killed Hurst.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Do my parents know what I did?<eos> Yes, Kyle, they do.
Tell me you understand.<eos> I understand. And my sister is unharmed?<eos> Thank you, Director Widener.<eos> At this time, the committee would like to call Porter Pearce CEO Meg Fitch.<eos> Ms. Fitch, you've been called today to answer allegations that your company is linked to that horrible video showing American servicemen shooting innocent civilians.<eos> I welcome the opportunity, Mr. Chairman.<eos> I welcome the opportunity, Mr. Chairman.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear that the testimony you give before this Senate committee today will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
He bled white!<eos> He had worms in his blood!<eos> - Sir, you need to chill out.<eos> - Get the light out of my face, man.<eos> - In a couple of hours, you'll come down off<eos> Of whatever shit you took, but in the meantime,<eos> You need to follow my instructions.<eos> Now bend forward and expose your buttocks.<eos> - I didn't take nothing.<eos> I don't do drugs.
- Anyone else with them?<eos> - Not that I know.<eos> Do you know where your brother's truck is?<eos> A 2004 Chevy Silverado...<eos> I know what it is.<eos> It's not here.<eos> He drove it last night.<eos> Now, your brother's friend, was he a Lausenschlange too?<eos> - I don't know what you mean.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
There is no mistaking that.<eos> I'll kill all of you!<eos> I don't think she knows what you're talking about.<eos> Listen to me. Hey!<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You're a Grimm?<eos> So am I.<eos> You've heard that before?<eos> - It doesn't mean anything.<eos> - Yes, it does.
- Hey.<eos> - Ooh, I can't even look at it.<eos> But you love it.<eos> It's your favorite.<eos> Well, now I'm sick of it. What else you got?<eos> But this is special pudding.<eos> Yes, made with a special ingredient.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Love.<eos> Well, I don't want it.<eos> Of course you do.
Oh, yeah, there was!<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna email Dr. Grayson, tell him I don't want any part of that snooty practice.<eos> - He kicked ya out, didn't he?<eos> - On my ass.<eos> Haskell?<eos> Did you tell Phil you didn't go through with it?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't have the balls.<eos> And now... Neither does he.
Oh, goodness me.<eos> You so loved champagne.<eos> So, what shall we eat?<eos> Doctor said they got the results of his CAT scan.<eos> It's good news, they didn't find any.<eos> - Cats.<eos> - You've been using that joke for 15 years.<eos> Yeah, and it's been working for 15 years.<eos> - No, it doesn't work.<eos> - Yes, it does.
I need that module for the OS and I need it today.<eos> Any questions?<eos> I got a question. Are you banging Joe MacMillan?<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm stupid for thinking a toy store might carry the world's most popular toy.<eos> Hello?<eos> Debbie!<eos> - Any luck?<eos> - Not yet!<eos> Uh, yes, I'm looking for a Cabbage Patch Kid.<eos> You do?
You know why?<eos> It's because in dreams, people don't lie.<eos> That's my business.<eos> It's all in my new book.<eos> In dreams I walk with you.<eos> Let's read an excerpt.<eos> "as a child, my small frame would buckle at the girth Of my outsized intellect."<eos> - Look, shawn and I are friendly, But it's emmanuelle That is the cause of my nightmares, okay?<eos> And for the record, I do not need shawn.<eos> - Sure, you don't.
Oh. Oh, gosh.<eos> I need some sleep. Oh. - Won't you give me a ride?<eos> What the--<eos> What?<eos> Zach?<eos> - We don't have much time.<eos> - I'm so sweaty.<eos> I just ran a bunch of fatties across the football field.<eos> - I want you now.<eos> - Of course you do.
- This show is horrible.<eos> - They're all gonna laugh at you.<eos> - Zach?<eos> Who lives like this?<eos> Shawn!<eos> - Shawn ditched you again, didn't he?<eos> - He said he had to pee.<eos> - Yes, but do you believe the world is a man's toilet?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I do not.
The danger just getting started!<eos> It's gonna be one of those backwater towns, huh?<eos> Salvage what you can.<eos> I want an expanding perimeter on the swamp.<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> Hey, Chris, it's me.<eos> Why don't you give me a call?<eos> I'm just thinking about you.<eos> I told her, "Look, honey, Trevor is my man."<eos> Yes, I did.
Okay.<eos> -We're good, we're good.<eos> Let's get in there and check it out.<eos> Molotov cocktails.<eos> We could throw them at them, while we make a retreat.<eos> You know, Bryce died two years ago.<eos> Since then, I thought a lot about how I might die.<eos> Not one time did I ever consider killer fish.<eos> We're gonna make it through this.<eos> Kerri didn't, the old man on the boat didn't.
Don't be so hard on Carrie.<eos> You know Joe threatened her.<eos> That's why she lied to you.<eos> You're defending her?<eos> Her? No.<eos> I'm just saying she's been through a lot.<eos> We all have, and one day, all of this is gonna be over, and you're gonna have a life.<eos> You think so?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
So it's a family film.<eos> Thank you again for dinner.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Good night.<eos> Uh, it's date night.<eos> Aren't you, uh, forgetting something?<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?<eos> No.<eos> Well, they do.
Back me up.<eos> Back me up.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Ray Ron.<eos> Hi, Morgan and Dan. What up?<eos> Happy earth day.<eos> You here for the discount recycled paper?<eos> Look, Ray Ron, I got to come clean.<eos> You don't have to do this right now.<eos> I do.
I know Ma.<eos> I won't happen again.<eos> Aran.<eos> Please Ma.<eos> Not the lecture.<eos> You know I do my best for you, don't you.<eos> With what I've got.<eos> Your granda was an alcoholic.<eos> I know.<eos> No, you don't.
Wait here.<eos> He wants you to follow him and have a chat.<eos> Where?<eos> Back there.<eos> There must be a room.<eos> What are you sorry for?<eos> I didn't want it to happen.<eos> No?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't..
Get a fuckin' shovel, Dean.<eos> Need to get that money dug up.<eos> This is it.<eos> I'm not staying here.<eos> No way.<eos> What am I goin' to do?<eos> I'll park round the other side, now you know where it is.<eos> You can walk over a couple of fields.<eos> I don't want to get caught here.<eos> I don't Siobhan.
You know,<eos> I've been hearing some whispers about this Castithan guy named, uh, Skevur, is it?<eos> You wouldn't know anything about this, uh, Skevur, looking for some payback, would you?<eos> Drug thing maybe?<eos> Just gossip.<eos> 'Cause you're a father now, and you have responsibilities.<eos> I know.<eos> Shortly after your wedding, I had some of my miners kick your ass.<eos> You remember that and what I said?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I taught you better than that.<eos> Don't do that again.<eos> I deserved to die.<eos> Hey! Stop talking like that.<eos> Anyway, you didn't.<eos> Irzu won't let me die.<eos> Will you stop that?<eos> This thing inside you, it doesn't come from Irzu or any other kind of God.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I do, okay?
Jess Murnane rang.<eos> What did she want?<eos> She didn't say.<eos> She, um... she came to see me today.<eos> She doesn't think I did it.<eos> Why?<eos> Why what?<eos> Why did she tell you that?<eos> I don't know. I mean... make me feel better, I guess.<eos> And do you?
- be a crime?<eos> - In this case, it should be.<eos> I'll research it back at my office.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So now...<eos> - what can I do for you?<eos> - I came to warn you.<eos> Michel told me about Sebastian Berger.<eos> - He wants him prosecuted.<eos> - No, he does not.
Ooh! ♪ showtime.<eos> Heather, hi.<eos> You look lovely as always.<eos> You met me once.<eos> Can I have my earring?<eos> Not till you've met Emma.<eos> Hi, Heather.<eos> How'd you like to go out with my daddy again?<eos> He sure does like you.<eos> Oh, sweetie, they all do.
I thought you were single.<eos> - Yeah, but... - Single?<eos> Why would you tell him that you're single?<eos> You just told me that you loved me.<eos> Yeah, that's just something I say to people, you know?<eos> Hey, I love you!<eos> I love you, too!<eos> Bonnie, what is going on?<eos> I thought we had something special.<eos> Yeah, Brad, we... we do.
- Yeah, but... - Single?<eos> Why would you tell him that you're single?<eos> You just told me that you loved me.<eos> Yeah, that's just something I say to people, you know?<eos> Hey, I love you!<eos> I love you, too!<eos> Bonnie, what is going on?<eos> I thought we had something special.<eos> Yeah, Brad, we... we do.<eos> We did.
We just love hazing the new reporters, you know?<eos> Wait wait.<eos> You're the dude that hates me?<eos> Well, you're half right.<eos> But this was fun!<eos> Enjoy tomorrow's column.<eos> Now look what you've done! Whoa. After you, ladies.<eos> Maybe this whole college thing isn't the worst idea after all. It has its perks, but I'm afraid you're a little late and I have to leave for a meeting.<eos> Oh, am I?<eos> Do you?
Logan, I like you.<eos> And I like you too.<eos> Which is why this will never work.<eos> I have to be able to write the truth about you.<eos> And unfortunately, your game's not as pretty as you are.<eos> Hey... I'm working on it.<eos> Not as hard as you should be.<eos> I think you're a really good player, but you could be great.<eos> You really think so?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You know my knowledge of the law is limited to TV shows and that time we went to jury duty just to pick up girls.<eos> Look, I don't care who she killed.<eos> That defendant was guilty of first degree sexiness.<eos> You may not know anything about the law, but we do know someone who does.<eos> Well, unfortunately the deposed is indisposed and won't be re-disposed until an undisclosed time.<eos> So in other words, I'm gonna be a while. - Oh!<eos> - It's all right.<eos> I've got you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
I don't know.<eos> I've been putting out there for like 15 years.<eos> Yeah, but, Danny, she called you "the one."<eos> The one what?<eos> Okay, I can lead you to water, Danny, but I can't make you think.<eos> Hey, there's my legal eagle.<eos> How did it go?<eos> Does your dad still think you're a lawyer?<eos> Yep. (Laughs)<eos> Yep, he does.
- Huh. - I so embrace our job.<eos> We maintain the base, we take care of its families.<eos> Our job is like a majestic bald eagle you just want to hug.<eos> And eagle clawed my eyeballs when I was ten.<eos> How are you still alive?<eos> Part of me died a long time ago.<eos> - At ease.<eos> - Carry on.<eos> Do you like tablet computers?<eos> - I do. - Yeah.
Well, that's-- that's great news, right?<eos> I mean... Do they know how-- how he'll be?<eos> Won't know for a few days, he said.<eos> I can't stay.<eos> Got a meeting.<eos> You weren't crazy, Ted.<eos> When you were suspicious...<eos> When you were angry at me for spending time with him, you weren't crazy.<eos> Not that anything happened.<eos> It didn't, but...
Hi.<eos> We got your M.R.I. back.<eos> There's some sludge in your bile duct.<eos> But, uh, the good news is, it's not completely obstructed.<eos> However, there is some bad news.<eos> Hi! Hi! That's so great.<eos> Wow, the nurses gave you some pain meds, huh?<eos> Pfft, yeah.<eos> I have a button.<eos> Yes, you do.
Oh, Randall.<eos> It's okay, it's okay.<eos> Hey, do you know how to watusi?<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> Okay.<eos> You throw your arms back like there's a bee in your sleeve, and you watusi.<eos> You know your grandma crane was a dance hall champion?<eos> - No.<eos> - No, you did not.
I don't know what-what I'm supposed to do.<eos> You don't have to do anything.<eos> Just stay, I'll do it all.<eos> You shouldn't have to work to be my daughter.<eos> Yeah, I will have to, 'cause you're not gonna be able to take care of yourself.<eos> What?<eos> For the love of god, look at the hair.<eos> Is this the hair of a man who can't take care of himself?<eos> I have your hair.<eos> Yes, you do.
I should've factored that into the original equation, and I didn't.<eos> So, okay, what-what are my odds now?<eos> They're considerably improved.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, um, why don't you... close your eyes, get some rest?<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Oh, hey, doc.<eos> Do you know how to work this TV thing?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Alastair kept jabbing his finger at him and then Tom stormed off.<eos> ~ What time was this?<eos> ~ Around ten. I was just putting my gun away before my programme started.<eos> We'll need any firearms for testing.<eos> ~ Thanks.<eos> ~ Is this really necessary?<eos> Morning, Detective Inspector.<eos> So, what have we got?<eos> I thought you had lots of plans for your retirement.<eos> ~ I did. I do.
Then read my sin, see for yourself.<eos> Tell me you're unmoved.<eos> No.<eos> You will not touch me.<eos> Because you fear you will witness the depth of my suffering.<eos> You are sick with Moloch's evil, but you can fight it.<eos> You can spare her...<eos> Jeremy.<eos> You have a choice.<eos> Yes, I do.
I choose who I am.<eos> I am the Horseman of Death!<eos> You have no sword.<eos> You are nothing.<eos> The trumpet.<eos> From the Book of Revelation.<eos> We're too late.<eos> I fear the prophecy was correct.<eos> I cannot see the sword because I do not know myself.<eos> No, you do.
I just need you to sign this.<eos> It's quite standard.<eos> A confirmation that you're enlisting my services.<eos> Here's a pen.<eos> Ow!<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry. It's a family heirloom.<eos> I'm afraid over the years it's developed some rough edges.<eos> It happens to all of us, right? Yes!<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it does.
How I know is not important.<eos> But another soldier has been cursed.<eos> Help us.<eos> Please.<eos> Hey, Frank!<eos> There's some people here that need your help.<eos> Unbelievable. Hmm. What?<eos> You pierced your ear.<eos> You used to hate needles.<eos> Yeah, I still do.
I'm definitely not buying her breakfast.<eos> I'm gonna see if Katrina can give us a bearing on Miss Love-Em- and-Eat-Em.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Steady.<eos> Man.<eos> Just can't seem to get rid of the crazy ones.<eos> The creature is drawn to those who hide desire in their heart.<eos> Hey, I, no, I'm... I'm grateful, you know?<eos> She saved my life.<eos> As you did hers.
A newspaper, Wade.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Without the Belles, this Toast and Roast is toast.<eos> If they're putting on their own show, who's gonna want to watch us?<eos> I don't even know what we're doing here.<eos> I got 19 episodes of Chicago Fire burning up my DVR.<eos> We all done crying in our soup?<eos> Oh, come on, Lavon, you got to admit, things are looking mighty bleak.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
We are listening to a raving insect!<eos> - Did you speak to my father?<eos> - Yes. I tried to help him.<eos> It was your father's final wish.<eos> Could you excuse us for a moment?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Karl is supposed to lead them.<eos> Not if only you know the way.<eos> I don't know the way!<eos> Sure you do!
"Listen to the yellow bird".<eos> Right!<eos> Darius says "yellow bird".<eos> 2 minutes later, a yellow bird shows up!<eos> This is nonsense!<eos> Darius talked to you?<eos> What did he say?<eos> Well, he made me promise to take you to Africa.<eos> - He said that?<eos> Yeah, he did.
Thanks, super hero.<eos> Don't thank me, thank him!<eos> Thank the blubber!<eos> Really, thanks for everything!<eos> I know what to do now. Goodnight.<eos> Goodnight!<eos> Thanks again.<eos> Delf, I have... something to tell you.<eos> I think I know, Mr. Hero.<eos> - You do?
Everyday.<eos> - This is a work of art!<eos> It's supposed to be admired and adored, not used, in any traditional sense.<eos> Look at him, look at him, look at him.<eos> He's just gazing up at us, all full of love and admiration, hope, passion, rigidity.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - Okay listen...<eos> - Can we talk about this?<eos> But he needs... he deserves a good life.<eos> He does.
I told you.<eos> I was working.<eos> You know Danny wasn't at school today, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Danny died last night.<eos> How?<eos> We're not sure.<eos> He was found lying on the beach early this morning.<eos> Does his mom and dad know?<eos> Yeah, they do.
I used to do the same thing with Tom.<eos> Does Tom know?<eos> Promise me, Ellie, because I don't know your boss.<eos> You and me, we go back.<eos> The boys go back.<eos> I'm relying on you to catch them.<eos> I promise you, Beth.<eos> I promise.<eos> He did know, didn't he, that I love him?<eos> Of course he did.
Mo' mass, mo' speed, mo' "mentum."<eos> (Laughs) Nailed it!<eos> What's up, Coach?<eos> So, when we were studying and I brought up college, what did you mean by,<eos> "that's not gonna happen"?<eos> I meant I'm not gonna leave my mom and I'm not trying to go 50k in debt by the time I'm 21.<eos> What if you could get a scholarship for field hockey?<eos> They have those?<eos> (Scoffs) They have scholarships for kids who speak Klingon,<eos> - so yeah, they do.
If it makes other people uncomfortable, that's their problem.<eos> - I wish I could be more like that.<eos> - You can.<eos> So your book bombs?<eos> Big deal!<eos> You tried something!<eos> Unless you want to climb back on that safe little boat<eos> - I found you on.<eos> - No.<eos> I don't.
It can track dragon sounds from miles away.<eos> And that hopefully includes our friend, the Screaming Death.<eos> And you're just in time to see me demonstrate.<eos> All right, demonstrate away.<eos> Okay, now put your ear up to this.<eos> Toothless, plasma blast.<eos> Oh, there's the signal, girl.<eos> Do you remember the song?<eos> What am I saying?<eos> Of course you do.
I just--I thought that he was past this stage, but I guess it's never over, so...<eos> Uh, all right, listen, thanks a lot for staying here with him.<eos> I know it couldn't have been easy after seeing that.<eos> Max is--is a cool dude, you know, most of the time.<eos> And honestly, I'm not supposed to say this, but a lot of these kids-- they're jackasses.<eos> - Well...<eos> - You know, I-I try to--<eos> I try to step in where I can, but it's--it's gotten bad.<eos> I think that next year is gonna be much better.<eos> I really do.
You can't always just sit and hope.<eos> Sometimes you got to make something happen.<eos> Who are you calling?<eos> Boba fete.<eos> Yes, I'd like a delivery, please.<eos> What's your address?<eos> The second sticky table directly in front of you.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Oh, hey!<eos> Howdy-do!
I don't know.<eos> You getting as tired of that answer as I am?<eos> You could say that.<eos> So, cheap and stupid.<eos> Guess I'll have to get by on my looks.<eos> Like you don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> What's that on your wrist?<eos> It's faded ink.<eos> And of course I don't know what it means.<eos> But you did.
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?<eos> They grow up so fast.<eos> You already know why I asked you to come here.<eos> I assume the lawsuit jarred you out of your stubborn obliviousness.<eos> You don't move in straight lines Kellogg.<eos> You never have.<eos> You say you want apples when you want oranges.<eos> You claim you want to sue me and pretend you want a pay day.<eos> I just want things to be fair.<eos> No you don't.
♪ And round our temples roses twine<eos> ♪ And let us cheerfully awhile, like the wine and roses smile<eos> ♪ Today is ours, what do we fear?<eos> ♪ Today is ours, we have it here. ♪<eos> You mistake, sir.<eos> Today is ours and so must your jewels be.<eos> You shall not touch her.<eos> Step aside.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Yes, I do.
We're not doing it.<eos> We're not?<eos> Did we not get parts?<eos> I did not get one, no.<eos> You did.<eos> You're in the chorus.<eos> - You want to be in the chorus?<eos> - No.<eos> I didn't even want to do it in the first place, so...<eos> No, you didn't.
How come you're quitting, quitter?<eos> I'm just not that into it.<eos> That's all.<eos> Because your mom didn't get a part?<eos> She totally should have.<eos> She was really good.<eos> But you don't want to do it without her?<eos> - Is that it?<eos> - I... no, I didn't want to do it in the first place, so...<eos> Yeah, you didn't.
My house, my rules.<eos> We only had one rule in our house, and that was:<eos> Love each other.<eos> And how did that work out?<eos> One is a fugitive.<eos> Oh... He's a very nice fugitive.<eos> The other one is divorced and living on an island as far away from his parents as he can possibly get.<eos> And my two girls, well, they are... they're a whole nother story.<eos> Right. But they got love.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Long _BAR_ive..<eos> - Bhau Sahib.<eos> Ladies and gentleman, I have a question for you.<eos> I want a reply.<eos> This ghost who is contesting the election.<eos> ..why is he fighting from our area?<eos> Do you have an answer?<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you?<eos> You don't?
Game night, seriously?<eos> Like what, scattergories?<eos> She's wondering if you play scattergories.<eos> I don't even know what that is.<eos> Okay, we're a little bit unclear on the scattergories front, but Will needs a date, like, really bad.<eos> - Just...<eos> - How can I say no to you?<eos> And by some minor miracle, I actually have the night off, so just have Will send me the deets, and I'll be there when my shift ends.<eos> Sounds like a plan. She said yes.<eos> Don't you ever, ever, ever do that again.
You let them come hunt me down because I've had a good ride.<eos> How would you like to get back in the fight, Joe?<eos> So what do you have in mind?<eos> I've been thinking about this whole thing the wrong way.<eos> Guerrera pack loves to hunt.<eos> They're primal, alphas.<eos> I gave you my reason for not making a move these past few months.<eos> What, pray tell, is theirs?<eos> They don't have the stake.<eos> Well, then who the hell does?
Look. I just want to get my stuff and get out of town.<eos> And why would we let you do that?<eos> Because I got information that could be very useful to Francesca Guerrera.<eos> We're taking the 12 original rings.<eos> Now 4 of them sit on the hands of the Guerrera brothers,<eos> One on Oliver, one on Francesca, 3 with her home security detail, and the rest scattered amongst her lackeys.<eos> Now each ring is distinguishable by its setting--<eos> Gauche like those that wear them.<eos> Klaus thinks you have the white oak stake.<eos> But we don't.
- I'm aware.<eos> - I'm what this realm needs.<eos> Nobles like my father Lord Narcisse gave the crown to your husband's family.<eos> They can take it away.<eos> You're making a mistake!<eos> And your husband will hate you for it.<eos> As soon as he learns how the world works, how it's always worked.<eos> Open the door, put him inside.<eos> His mother knows it.<eos> So did his father.
Hey, this whole thing was your idea.<eos> Living together, trying to be human was your idea!<eos> Ok, you don't wanna do it, I will. Hey!<eos> Let him suffer.<eos> The eye thing was a perfect touch.<eos> So you got to see the world.<eos> You got to indulge in a totally alternative lifestyle, right?<eos> But there's no place like home.<eos> I need a drink.<eos> Of course, you do.
It wasn't what our parents built for us.<eos> It was what we made for ourselves, Those small moments of who buys the milk and who gets the mail, Who makes you smile on a terrible day.<eos> Where we were, that was home, that was family...<eos> A place where we could shut the door and keep the world at bay.<eos> A thick silence in a room That fills up the space of someone you love.<eos> We can all stay here.<eos> - No, no, I wanna give you guys some space.<eos> - We don't need s-space.<eos> - Aidan, after everything that's happened...<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Meet me at the house in an hour.<eos> You better talk to nora, because she's gonna wanna--<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> I got it. One hour. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Sorry, josh.<eos> Ramona.<eos> Well, there you are.<eos> - I see you got my message.<eos> - Yep!<eos> I did.
So, you think Jamie Berman's somehow responsible for Cordero's death?<eos> Well, if Berman knew he had incriminated himself on tape... He'd go to any lengths to get it back.<eos> Victoria, this investigation is ongoing, and exposing it to Mr. Berman or anyone at JP Harding would break federal statutes.<eos> But I thought that this was something that you and your team needed to know.<eos> I'd certainly say so.<eos> So, I trust that you will keep my office in the loop if there are any significant developments.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Of course.<eos> Sir, I didn't... I didn't know you had a sister.<eos> Oh, well, now you do.
What about Mommy?<eos> Do you love her?<eos> Well, I just don't understand why we can't live together and things can be like they used to.<eos> Okay.<eos> Because sometimes people who love each other need a little time apart to remember why they loved each other in the first place.<eos> But I promise you I'm working on it.<eos> No, you're lying.<eos> No, sweetie.<eos> Yeah, you don't love her.<eos> - Yes, I do.
The belief is that the evil spirit can direct bad luck or even injury at someone with nothing more than a simple look.<eos> Children, particularly the ones that are not baptized, are believed to be more susceptible to this curse.<eos> Next.<eos> Oftentimes in Central America, you'll see children wearing something red or even having a simple red thread tied around the wrist to ward off Mal de Ojo.<eos> Lights, please.<eos> Okay, well, finish the readings on superstition for next time.<eos> Alyson, hi.<eos> I'm sorry to hear things aren't going well with the move. - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Did you bring it?<eos> I did.
I've got the black cable.<eos> Myka!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I mean, is everything all right down...<eos> We are not talking about that, okay?<eos> What the hell are you guys still doing out here?<eos> Am I really the only one that reads the Regent's Addendums to the manual?<eos> Okay, look, we know that the shield draws its power from the Alpha Centauri Star System.<eos> - I knew that.<eos> - No, he didn't.

You have no idea what you are giving up, what you are stealing from mankind.<eos> You're gonna make a nice Para-bookends.<eos> Now let's go.<eos> You're gonna have to kill me.<eos> Well, I'm glad we agree about that. Oh.<eos> Good.<eos> I hope that hurt!<eos> So then the problem was we had two bronzed paracelsii in the Warehouse, right?<eos> You know, I do have better things to do.<eos> No, you don't.
No, I don't.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> It's looking like that's all I got left, you know?<eos> Some kind of insanity plea.<eos> I just don't want to spend the rest of my life in a cage.<eos> It's not about what you want.<eos> You gave that up when you walked in here.<eos> I'm-I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> There are gonna be consequences, obviously, but if you choose to live, man, there's... you can make something out of that life.<eos> What if I don't?
What do you mean, "noise?"<eos> I mean literally, noise. Across every S.H.I.E.L.D. communication channel.<eos> Some sort of blanket signal.<eos> - Encoded data, maybe?<eos> - I think so.<eos> You wanna fill us in?<eos> We root you out, a mole, suddenly our plane shuts down, our communications jammed.<eos> I don't know what's happening, I wish I did.<eos> - You have to believe me.<eos> - No, I don't.
Because I'm trustworthy.<eos> You're the one who works for the zombie robot back from the dead.<eos> Take it.<eos> If you try to kill me with it, I'll know I can't trust you.<eos> Now, fire that thing back up.<eos> Let's see if we can get our friends on the line.<eos> Can't wait to tell them the good news.<eos> Coulson said you're an informant.<eos> Wanna elaborate on that?<eos> No, I don't.
Give me your ICER.<eos> - What are you gonna do?<eos> - Pave the way for you.<eos> - There's, like, 100 guys out there.<eos> - Twelve.<eos> Level 5 foot soldiers, basic armor package, and no other way through.<eos> The others are depending on us.<eos> But it's suicide.<eos> Not if I don't die.<eos> - And if I do...
You need a life.<eos> This is a dossier on the new AUSA, Theresa Alvarez.<eos> Texas Tech undergrad, Northwestern Law.<eos> She was in tax fraud before moving<eos> - to organized crime.<eos> - Where was she born?<eos> ROBYN: Mm, I don't know.<eos> Where does she live?<eos> - We don't need that.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Girls, with a few months' training?<eos> Our nurses feel the insult most keenly.<eos> Did you know that military nurses are forbidden to marry?<eos> Isn't that just awful?<eos> It's like being a nun!<eos> Do either of you two have chaps or fiances in khaki?<eos> You're very daring.<eos> Might I have one?<eos> Flora.<eos> All the actresses do it.
A prayer, or...?<eos> They're rotten.<eos> Neither use nor ornament.<eos> Chuck them in, and get back to what you're doing.<eos> Sharpish.<eos> Go on.<eos> There. Now you know what to do.<eos> Isn't what you expected, is it?<eos> You'll get used to it.<eos> What if I don't?
You disobeyed an order.<eos> You were told to make the beds in the new ward tents.<eos> I needed some fresh air.<eos> You disobeyed an order.<eos> For a moment, yes.<eos> But the soldier asked me for a cigarette.<eos> You should have asked an orderly to help him and returned immediately to the task you were given.<eos> I thought it more important to help the soldier.<eos> You thought that was more important than my order?<eos> Yes, Matron, I did.
Who?<eos> Your husband.<eos> Can he talk to you?<eos> Of course he can talk.<eos> That's good.<eos> George, my boy, he can't talk.<eos> He was hit in the head.<eos> I don't think he sees me.<eos> Doesn't know I'm there.<eos> Of course he does.
Well, that was the first time we'd met, but Talbot did seem to enjoy winding him up.<eos> Let Doris get her pinny out!<eos> Did he have problems with anyone else?<eos> Let's just say he was never going to win the prize for the most popular campmate.<eos> He was fine with me.<eos> Do you have a card?<eos> In case I run into something later?<eos> Yes, that'll be all, I think, for now.<eos> Well... you know where I am.<eos> Yes, we do.
Not Anna?<eos> Or Joseph?<eos> Joseph?<eos> The only time Joseph's got involved in the company is across the bloody picket line.<eos> The picket line being?<eos> Joseph protested against some of Father's resort plans.<eos> Father almost had him thrown in jail.<eos> Do you have the combination for the safe?<eos> No.<eos> But Emily does.
Perhaps what you said was right.<eos> He was always very business minded.<eos> When I wanted to pursue the arts - my dreams - rather than join the family firm...<eos> Five minutes.<eos> That's all I ever wanted.<eos> Five minutes for him to sit and read something I'd written or look at a painting I'd done and I mean, really look, not just glance and dismiss it...<eos> Not just glance and dismiss me.<eos> SHE CHUCKLES Look. Did I have issues with my father?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
Is that how you read it?<eos> What?<eos> Look here Amidral, the enemy fleets have already exceeded 200, Are you aware of the fact that many of our soldiers are running away already?<eos> - Captain Kim Eok-Choo- In the last ten days, about 50 soldiers have run away already...<eos> I must ask you today, Admiral...<eos> We have no idea when this enemy would show up at our doorstep, and that could be tonight.<eos> So I'm curious, how do you propose to fight against such enemies?<eos> Let's heart it from our young officers!<eos> Do we stand a chance?<eos> Do we? !
Well it will be very helpful to our investigation to know exactly what's been removed.<eos> I checked the records as soon as we knew about the robbery.<eos> That particular box was empty.<eos> As I mentioned, we have more than a few.<eos> You do know that impeding a police investigation is a very serious offense.<eos> And you know that as a Fortune500 company, we have a full complement of lawyers that can back-up my truthful and helpful statement.<eos> But why go there.<eos> Liber8 is behind this robbery Mr. Richardson.<eos> You don't want them having anything of yours.<eos> And they don't.
The very first woman of space.<eos> - She was looking for her Mego?<eos> - She was looking for her Mego.<eos> Mike being the resident trekkie of the group, man, a member of the original Trek Bridge in the store, you must've been going crazy.<eos> I was geeking out all over the place.<eos> Just, kind of, phasers on "fun."<eos> You should have a case of these.<eos> - I should.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But oddly enough, I don't.
Negative.<eos> We're in an old commercial paint shop, so it's hard to get a solid result, but there was definitely a cook here.<eos> The product's gone, though.<eos> Get all residue specimens to Cassidy as soon as possible.<eos> I want to know the concentration levels we're dealing with.<eos> Rebecca, I need to leave for a while.<eos> Um... could we talk later?<eos> Mom, I have four paintings to finish, so, you know,<eos> I wish that I'd known you were coming by earlier.<eos> But I didn't, so...
See? That's your problem, Brick.<eos> You are a rigid thinker.<eos> That's why I'm gonna end up ruling the world.<eos> All the big-time rich guys -- Steve Jobs... other guys -- they're all creative thinkers, risk-takers.<eos> I don't know about this, Axl.<eos> Wha-- look, that's fine.<eos> Go ahead. Dress like one of the characters in the book and do a lame presentation like a million other kids.<eos> What do you want, Brick?<eos> Do you want to go the safe route, or do you want to be an innovator, a trailblazer, a rule breaker? !<eos> I do.
So, this is where the Heck laundry goes down, huh?<eos> Yep, this is where the magic happens.<eos> I've seen the clean clothes, but you never get to see behind the scenes.<eos> [ Laughs ] Very few have had the privilege.<eos> [ Clears throat ] So, listen, I was thinking, you know, sometimes people don't always have dates to the prom.<eos> [ Chuckles ] And I don't know if you do or you don't, but if you don't and you want to go, I'm around, so I could take you if you want.<eos> Are you kidding me right now?<eos> ! No, uh, but if you don't want to --<eos> No. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I do, I do, I do.

You're prepared!<eos> You were a good teacher.<eos> Whooo. Oh, this is not how it ends.<eos> Well, let me know when you find an alternative.<eos> You've been reading that book on management. What's the name?<eos> I haven't...<eos> The "power in silence"...<eos> No, no questions where a statement will do, roll over your enemies with legal power.<eos> Hell, you know the author.<eos> I don't.
The weapons-maker owns Channel #1?<eos> Diana Bolton ran a huge expose on Fermitas a couple years ago.<eos> Fermitas announced an intention to sue, then dropped the suit.<eos> People figured it was because it wasn't winnable, but really...<eos> If you can't muzzle the press, you buy them.<eos> Private acquisition.<eos> Private acquisition?<eos> So nobody knows?<eos> Lucas might have found out.<eos> Did he?
No.<eos> She wasn't.<eos> I saw her.<eos> She was on medication.<eos> I saw the pills.<eos> That's what she does.<eos> She has a problem.<eos> I don't need to tell you what the stakes are here.<eos> That's right, Alan.<eos> You don't.
Ruth, Marcus and I just got a call from a client who's been arrested for assault.<eos> We're gonna have to run down to the courthouse.<eos> Aw, damn!<eos> Mama, I'm so sorry.<eos> 'Cause I really wanted to spend some mama/son time.<eos> I'm sorry, Ma.<eos> I'm proud of you, son.<eos> I'll just get your daughter to help me.<eos> You know, maybe we got a pretty good thing going, you and I.<eos> - Maybe we do. - Yeah.
He was lost.<eos> Wait. What happened?<eos> - Look.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> Dr. Shepherd welcomes you all and regrets that he couldn't be here with you tonight.<eos> He has taken suddenly, and very disgustingly... ill.<eos> - I told you...<eos> I've heard it enough times.<eos> - So I am the wife.<eos> You did my speech.
Dr. Shepherd welcomes you all and regrets that he couldn't be here with you tonight.<eos> He has taken suddenly, and very disgustingly... ill.<eos> - I told you...<eos> I've heard it enough times.<eos> - So I am the wife.<eos> You did my speech.<eos> - And I'm here in his stead.<eos> - Well...<eos> When my husband was first approached about this project, I was not on board.<eos> I kind of did my speech.
It's really neat.<eos> Like, do you know Muslims have seven levels of Heaven?<eos> We only have one!<eos> And each level is like a Sandals Resort, but better.<eos> Shiri, find the nearest mental ward.<eos> Why can't she wear her scarf?<eos> Have I taught you nothing?<eos> Take this down.<eos> "You're not being a good friend when you don't tell someone they look ridiculous"...<eos> Which you do.
AND A TENDENCY FOR THE FEMALES TO EAT THE MALES?<eos> I THINK I'M READY FOR IT.<eos> : JUST PUT AWAY THE SUNGLASSES AND ESCORT THIS YOUNG LADY TO WEST 242.<eos> SO, YOU'RE A STUDENT HERE?<eos> OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE A STUDENT HERE. IF YOU WENT SOMEWHERE ELSE, YOU'D PROBABLY BE THERE.<eos> YES, I PROBABLY WOULD BE THERE.<eos> NOT THAT THAT WOULD BE A BAD THING. I MEAN, THIS PLACE IS NUTS.<eos> IT'S LIKE A HORROR MOVIE.<eos> NO, IT'S LIKE...<eos> NO WONDER YOU DO THE SILENT-LONE-WOLF SUNGLASS-REBEL THING.
'I am returning from the garden with dirt under my nails.'<eos> Back there... ..in the village.... I just want to say thank you.<eos> We need a mechanic.<eos> If you couldn't fix the bus, I'd have left you there, and I'd have been glad to.<eos> Stop trying to prove yourself to us, Weston.<eos> You can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry about your brothers.<eos> I know how much they meant to you. Nah.<eos> No, you don't.
What... are you doing?<eos> Well, um...<eos> I don't know, I...<eos> I don't even remember what we were talking about.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - No, I, I...<eos> - It's just a lot -<eos> I want to let you know that I really appreciate sharing this space with you, I have to say, has been really lovely and important to me.<eos> Thank you...<eos> I do.
She kick you out?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Hey, check this out.<eos> The caulk on this window... it's fresh.<eos> Yeah, and the other ones are yellow and cracked.<eos> That means that somebody recently replaced that glass.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, come take a look at this.<eos> Does that look like blood to you?<eos> To the naked eye, yes, it does.
Yeah, see, that's the super cool thing about this website is it does all the work for us so we can just sit back and take it easy.<eos> No.<eos> No, we're not gonna do that.<eos> We're gonna sit forward and take it hard.<eos> - There's a lot of nitty-gritty left to do, Ben.<eos> We need to roll up our sleeves, we need to go door to door, we need to hand out fliers, and canvass.<eos> You know what we should do?<eos> We should have a press junket, to publicize the poll.<eos> Okay, I hope you had lunch plans, 'cause now you get to cancel them.<eos> Well, I-I did.
Yes, great question.<eos> I have been thinking of rebranding myself.<eos> What do you think about Juan Callamezzo?<eos> Isn't "Juan" a man's name?<eos> No, it means "flower."<eos> I think it means "John."<eos> Crazy Ira and the Douche from 93.7 FM, the Groove.<eos> Leslie, do you believe that this new slogan will integrate Pawnee and Eagleton into one cohesive city?<eos> Wow, that's a very thoughtful question, Crazy Ira.<eos> Yes, yes, I do.
His name's Daniel Casey.<eos> Mr. dillinger, what are you doing?<eos> - Casey, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we went to Cal Poly together way back when.<eos> So, you know him?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> But if I do run into him, I'll tell him you said hello.<eos> What'd you say your name was?<eos> I didn't.
Also a clean phone.<eos> Sounds like you thought of everything.<eos> So how long have you been running?<eos> I mean, look, it's obvious.<eos> This place, your setup.<eos> And I think you know more about that code than you're willing to admit.<eos> I know that anyone that has contact with this system that you worked on... either ends up dead... or they lose so much, they wish they were.<eos> The truth is, besides Mr. dillinger, you're the only person that's ever been here.<eos> I have to ask you--<eos> No, you don't.
Sweetie, I have a sponsor.<eos> I am going to meetings.<eos> I am okay.<eos> Wow, Grace, you look so grown up.<eos> Come on, Grace, my suit didn't even cost $600.<eos> I just wanted you to know that I got you that dress you liked.<eos> Well, I don't want it anymore.<eos> Grace, where is this coming from?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course you don't.
- I'm great.<eos> I mean, fine.<eos> Not great.<eos> I mean, also fine.<eos> You hang in there.<eos> Nurse Barkow.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You're all saints nurse of the month.<eos> We have a nurse of the month?<eos> We do now. Oh.
Whatever this is, it ain't about Grace.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> It isn't.<eos> This is about me not wanting to be with you.<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's exactly what Antoinette said was gonna happen.<eos> Yeah, fucking Antoinette.<eos> Of course she did.
Do I have to get a restraining order?<eos> You can't fire me, Jackie.<eos> I'm still your sponsor.<eos> This is the last of my stash.<eos> I've given up on my own before, I can do it again.<eos> I just wanted you to know that I got you that dress you liked.<eos> Well, I don't want it anymore.<eos> Grace, where is this coming from?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course you don't.
Joe didn't send me.<eos> But I know this is important to him.<eos> Important, hmm?<eos> What did Joe tell you about me?<eos> Look, I know you guys humped all over Europe or whatever.<eos> - And I don't care.<eos> - Oh, is that how he put it?<eos> Because I seem to remember it fairly differently.<eos> - Did he tell you I left him?<eos> - Yeah, he did.
I believe they still call it the White House, ma'am.<eos> - You gonna come visit me?<eos> - Visit? - Yeah.<eos> - I'm gonna redecorate.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> - Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.<eos> - You go right ahead.<eos> - Thank you. I just wanted to make sure that you had all the numbers on the "sanctuary states."<eos> Oh-- oh, yes.<eos> Yes, I do. Yes.
- Let's get started.<eos> - Now he spills his water!<eos> I swear, this kid is literally gonna shit himself.<eos> Joe Thornhill, you're an ex-baseball coach.<eos> People say you're way out of your league, literally.<eos> - Shouldn't you get off the field?<eos> - You know, ma'am...<eos> I'm just an ordinary guy and I live in the real America.<eos> I may not know much about running the country, I'll give you that. But you know what?<eos> Neither did George Washington.
Before I answer it, I'd like to start off by saying I would like to be the first to thank the kind folks here at the University of New Hampshire-- the faculty, the staff, the students, of course--<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - for--<eos> Excuse me, Congressman?<eos> I was-- yes.<eos> Yes, ma'am, absolutely.<eos> Great.<eos> I do want to answer that question.<eos> I've got to say, I like this new look.<eos> - You do?
No!<eos> Let me go!<eos> You're helping me.<eos> I remember.<eos> Stay-puft.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> I remember everything.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> All of it.<eos> We all do.
We don't have to... you know, if you're not sure.<eos> Oh, I'm sure.<eos> Sir.<eos> A word, please.<eos> Not the best time. Oh.<eos> I think you'll have time for this.<eos> Doyle is sending men out by the dozen looking for Monroe.<eos> And?<eos> And they don't know where he is.<eos> I do.
I'll be up in a few minutes.<eos> Yeah, I'm still full from dinner, so don't expect too much.<eos> I ate the soup, too, so you're off the hook.<eos> Oh, hey, Eve.<eos> Good night, Mom!<eos> Got a lot of homework to do!<eos> Wait!<eos> H-how was the date?<eos> Don't you want to talk about it?<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.
I taught fourth grade.<eos> I can go all day.<eos> You know, that was fun.<eos> If we go back in the daytime, we won't have to share a merry-go-round with a crackhead.<eos> I didn't see him.<eos> I mean, until he fell off, I did not see him.<eos> Dr. Rosen?<eos> Ms. Flynn, I'm sorry.<eos> Do we have an appointment?<eos> We don't, but...
You got to control that wife of yours.<eos> What'd she do now?<eos> Ugh.<eos> She's filling people's heads with these ridiculous pipe dreams.<eos> Vince used to wake me up in the middle of the night to have sex.<eos> Now it's just to see if the pin curls have set.<eos> I thought you liked him doing your hair.<eos> Really?<eos> I look like I'm in the damn touring company of Annie.<eos> It doesn't...
Ah, I just wanted to talk to you about an opportunity... yeah, I heard you talking to my mom, and I'm not interested.<eos> Well, you're gonna be interested!<eos> You're an airbender now, and you have a responsibility as a citizen of the world.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I didn't ask to become an airbender, you know.<eos> Well, I didn't ask to be the Avatar, but I am, and I'm fulfilling my duties.<eos> So?<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Yes, I do have to.<eos> No, you don't.

And when it does, the eagle always sees.<eos> This, uh, park business seems to be picking up speed.<eos> Now that Rockefeller's thrown in with them, they're making real offers.<eos> - They'll be coming to us next? - Yeah.<eos> Rockefeller's $5 million behind them.<eos> We're not interested.<eos> Well, I was asking your husband's opinion, Mrs. Pemberton, not yours.<eos> Easy.<eos> Well, I don't want you to worry about it.<eos> Well, I do.
Come feel.<eos> He's moving.<eos> Right here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The first of our dozen.<eos> - You want me to take that?<eos> I got it, Mr. Vaughn. Thank you.<eos> It's perfect, George. He'll love it.<eos> - How do you know it's a boy?<eos> - I just do.
So you used your time machine to get here? No.<eos> I had to use his.<eos> Mine doesn't work and it starts fires.<eos> So you came back through time just to tell me this?<eos> Just to be a narrator?<eos> And you didn't bring any special weapons or anything?<eos> Just a bucket load of exposition and a stupid mustache?<eos> ! Do you know what, Louise?<eos> At this point, if I had any special weapons, I'd use them on you!<eos> But you don't, right?
Or plan "B":<eos> We get it back by behaving worse.<eos> Keep talking.<eos> Uh-oh, I'm listening to music on a portable tape player, and it's making me very curious about sex.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No curiosity in the halls.<eos> I'll need my lock-picking kit.<eos> I've got mine right... ♪ Here... ♪<eos> Hmm? We've got to get to the P.A. system.<eos> But they already did the morning announcements.
Do I have my pants on?<eos> Ma'am, I don't wanna piss on your bliss, but...<eos> I'm gonna need you back in New Hampshire very, very soon.<eos> Okay, but I've got something to do really soon.<eos> I'm trying to remember what it is.<eos> What is it again, Mike? Hmm...<eos> I think you're becoming president of the United States!<eos> - (ALL CHEERING) - Yeah, we rule.<eos> - What?<eos> - Or you do, in fact.
My bit about voter ID laws identified itself as hilarious.<eos> Man, it's such an adrenaline rush.<eos> I am so pumped!<eos> - Well done.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> And if you do another press briefing on no sleep again, you're fired.<eos> Hey, Ben, Ben, Ben.<eos> You know how you told me that Chung's unit in Iraq tenured that guy?<eos> I never said that.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Wait a second. What are you doing in here?<eos> This is my office. See?<eos> My calculators on the desk.<eos> No, Selina said this is gonna be my office.<eos> You don't need an office.<eos> You have a bag.<eos> Okay, that's bullying. Well, why don't you take it up with the president?<eos> Why don't you call the Chief Justice and get them both in?<eos> And so it begins.<eos> Actually, it really does.
Yeah.<eos> We've seen one or two of 'em.<eos> That's what those sons of bitches did to me... that and a lot more.<eos> Look, I know I got nothing here, nothing but burned bridges.<eos> And I know there's no reason for you to take me, but I'm asking.<eos> And I can help.<eos> I need payback.<eos> And how do we know this isn't a trick?<eos> How do we know you're not zombified right now?<eos> You don't.
I help my grandma get dressed all the time.<eos> Eve, why aren't you dressed?<eos> We're up next.<eos> Yeah. Small problem.<eos> There's a mirror in there.<eos> I-I'm not wearing this in public.<eos> Come on.<eos> You can pull this off.<eos> I know.<eos> I just did.
Swear nothing happened between you two.<eos> I swear nothing happened between us.<eos> My God, what is wrong with you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know what's happening.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> This girl who accused him. What happened?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You do.
(speaking Chinese) I wish to make a full confession.<eos> - What?<eos> - You were right, Constable.<eos> I learned of his plans to kill me and Yu Da and the others.<eos> - We were told of his sensitivity to shrimp.<eos> - Wu...<eos> I killed him.<eos> The bullets match.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You do?
Let me help you with that.<eos> No, I'm just about done.<eos> Please, it's the least I can do.<eos> You do so much for us. Oh...<eos> I can do this, and, you know, we do appreciate it.<eos> I know it's-- it isn't easy for you.<eos> Oh, what, having you here? Mmhmm. Of course it's easy.<eos> We love having you here.<eos> I just wish Crosby had a little more empathy.<eos> He does, Camille.

Unbelievable.<eos> This family.<eos> What?<eos> Checking if you're still here?<eos> No, aida's baptism now has a dinner added.<eos> So now there's a dinner and then the baptism and a brunch.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> You know what you need?<eos> You need a beer.<eos> I do.
You are. Oh. What?<eos> Do you want me to use my mouth?<eos> - No.<eos> - What?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I've - - I'm... I'm just too upset.<eos> And I've had too much to drink.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Well, Clark, you don't have to leave.<eos> Yes, I do.
Yes.<eos> - She's totally right.<eos> - She's obviously wrong.<eos> Hey, great news.<eos> The air-conditioning repairman is coming on Thursday.<eos> - Why?<eos> - To fix the air-conditioning.<eos> Honey, it's not broken.<eos> You just don't know how to set it.<eos> - Yes, I do.

Dang, she's yummy<eos> I think I'll pass this one<eos> Why?<eos> Just do it It's your birthday<eos> Stay still, bitch!<eos> Shit!<eos> She pinched me<eos> Hold still, bitch and shut the fuck up<eos> Do you know how much to use?<eos> Do you or not?
Do some skiing in the while<eos> Internet cafe?<eos> Great job...thanks<eos> Pardon?<eos> There are more properties in Yang's name?<eos> Myung Sun Institute<eos> Send someone over there, too<eos> Myung Sun Institute<eos> Did you see him?<eos> Of course I did
We both know you're not.<eos> I don't have blood on my hands.<eos> Wait, so does Victoria pick the victims, or are you just scoring points with Mommy?<eos> You got no idea what she's been through, so stop attacking her.<eos> Or what?<eos> I'll have an accident next?<eos> You've totally changed.<eos> You don't even see it.<eos> You really think you know me, don't you?<eos> You don't.
You really think you know me, don't you?<eos> You don't.<eos> I know you used to be an artist.<eos> - And I know you've got a booth at the Art Walk that's currently sitting empty, and I know that Stefano Leone will be disappointed.<eos> Stefano Leone's gonna be there?<eos> I set it up back when we were dating.<eos> I, uh, wanted it to be a surprise.<eos> Patrick...<eos> I wanted good things for you, and -- call me crazy --<eos> Mm, I still do.
I was ready to face them.<eos> And you.<eos> Then how about this?<eos> How about you come over to my house tomorrow, officially meet your grandson?<eos> I would like nothing more.<eos> I thought Brunello appropriate to honor the next chapter of Patrick's life.<eos> Please thank Stefano again for affording him the opportunity.<eos> You were the one that made him an offer he couldn't refuse, but...<eos> In truth, even without the money, he thinks your boy has talent.<eos> Of course he does.
Valet's picking his teeth with it.<eos> You can't tell anyone was ever here.<eos> If anything, it's actually cleaner than it was before.<eos> Have to admit, Vlade is good.<eos> Annoying, but good.<eos> How was the Samovar Club?<eos> Oh, just when he finished the job, I got an emergency call from my boyfriend.<eos> So I had to tell Vlade I couldn't go.<eos> I didn't know you had a boyfriend.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, I don't.
Can I have your office?<eos> So what do you say?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> In case you were wondering,<eos> I passed on J.P.'s offer.<eos> He made an offer?<eos> - Yeah, but it wasn't good for us.<eos> - Us? Yeah, we do have a partnership here, Allen.<eos> Yeah, yeah, we do.
We overslept.<eos> We were hammered.<eos> I'm still hammered.<eos> Yeah, man, you just got to try not to let the girls see it, all right?<eos> We're at least pretending to raise them right, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tell Christie you came out here and you spanked me.<eos> I know.<eos> She lets me stay here.<eos> She does.
- Good to see you, sir.<eos> Wallace, I'm real sorry about your candidate.<eos> The commissioner sent me over to check up on your house.<eos> I got it covered, Bill.<eos> Or at least I'm trying.<eos> Look, Chief, I can go if you want me to.<eos> But your people have suffered a loss, and they may need help getting through this rough patch.<eos> Peter Mills is one of my people now.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> I did.
This is Damien, and this is Aaron.<eos> Screw this.<eos> Bloom, just give me one second.<eos> You are a son of a bitch.<eos> Hey, it's not like that, Captain.<eos> Oh, Captain!<eos> Captain. Aren't you cute?<eos> You can mail me my wallet.<eos> We didn't know what happened to you, Bloom.<eos> Now you do.
Got her.<eos> Call out!<eos> Gabby?<eos> Call out!<eos> - Hey!<eos> Dr. Arata, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did Gabby Dawson come in here?<eos> Did you seen her?<eos> Dawson... I did.
If you parked in the Sav-On parking lot, they do tow.<eos> Well, I didn't know if you wanted original Oreos or Double Stuf so I went a little nutty and I got both.<eos> How's it, um...<eos> - Fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Kevin?<eos> Hello?<eos> Fuck.<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> I did it again, I did it again.
What, like a "drink" drink?<eos> You go on dates with failures?<eos> - Constantly.<eos> - OK.<eos> - Uh... bye.<eos> OK.<eos> - Bye.<eos> You have any weapons or drugs on your person at this time?<eos> Why, yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm such an idiot. Middle out!<eos> Middle out!<eos> Middle out!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How could I...?<eos> Uh...<eos> Guys, does girth-similarity affect Erlich's ability to jerk different dicks simultaneously?<eos> Shit.<eos> Yeah, I think it would.<eos> Of course, it does.
Think of this... it's your first shot at big pharma.<eos> Are you two high on sleep meds right now?<eos> I know I'm not sleeping, 'cause if I was, you wouldn't be so far away and wearing so much. Uh-oh.<eos> All right, we'll just make a record of that.<eos> I was kidding, 'cause, you know, we're sleeping together.<eos> Dude?<eos> All right.<eos> Tuesday, June 22nd.<eos> Peter, do you have the time?<eos> - I do.
I can see a little bit of Corvette, a bit of E-Type...<eos> Then there's the, um... I think it was called the Discovery, the spaceship in 2001:<eos> A Space Odyssey.<eos> I see that at the front.<eos> And I love the way they paint it gold before they paint it red to make the colour richer.<eos> Then there's the name - "Disco Volante" - picked out in the seats.<eos> I know, in Italian, Disco Volante means "flying saucer"<eos> but to me, it's the name of Largo's hydrofoil in the Bond film Thunderball.<eos> I love that car.<eos> I really do.
Why can't you think of anyone but yourself?<eos> You're supposed to be my best mate, Chloe, and you don't give a shit.<eos> I'm not your mum, Rae.<eos> I can't look after you all the time.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You're fragile. You need constant management.<eos> It's not my fault you act like a kid.<eos> It's not my fault your frigid.<eos> Did Saul say that?<eos> Yeah, he did.
Oh, that Stratos douche was right.<eos> The spirit of the mountain ... wait, hey, I have tear ducts?<eos> Well, nothing to do<eos> - but wait for Beast-man to bring help.<eos> - Where's Skeletor?<eos> Sometimes you are too much beast.<eos> Sure, I've heard.<eos> Waitforit ...<eos> - How did you know that would work?<eos> - I didn't.
I once accidentally downloaded a Lumineers song.<eos> I had to throw away my whole computer just to be safe.<eos> I feel like, to me, set list flow is very important.<eos> I mean, we're basically vibe curators.<eos> Ugh.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I hope that high school auditorium's big enough, 'cause I'm bringing 10,000 maniacs.<eos> Sometimes it's really hard to be friends with you.<eos> Thank God we don't have to be seen together.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Uh-huh!<eos> Ooh!<eos> Girl, you look creepy.<eos> - Would you like a drink?<eos> All this stuff is free. - No, it's not.<eos> - Why'd you pay for a limo?<eos> - Because it's prom.<eos> If you don't show up in a limo, legally, they can't let you in.<eos> - Does your mom want to take pictures?<eos> - Uh, yeah, she does.
What is it now, Rabbi Rosenberg?<eos> What is it now?<eos> Yes!<eos> Great!<eos> Now we all have to go to that "Brat" Mitzvah.<eos> Have fun explaining this to Dad!<eos> I'm sure Dad will love it.<eos> No way.<eos> Dad, you have to!<eos> No I don't, Tina.
I could "normalfy" this for you.<eos> - No.<eos> No, no.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Just listen.<eos> He's got sort of a working-class touch, which is something that's valuable, and we should listen to it.<eos> I printed a copy of the speech from the "G" folder.<eos> Why does he have access to the "G" folder?<eos> I don't even have access to the "G" folder.<eos> Yes, you do, Mike.
- No.<eos> No, no.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Just listen.<eos> He's got sort of a working-class touch, which is something that's valuable, and we should listen to it.<eos> I printed a copy of the speech from the "G" folder.<eos> Why does he have access to the "G" folder?<eos> I don't even have access to the "G" folder.<eos> Yes, you do, Mike.<eos> We all do.
!<eos> - Where is he?<eos> ! Where is my son?<eos> ! - We can't find him!<eos> Braden!<eos> Whoa!<eos> No running in the hall.<eos> Whoa!<eos> - I got you!<eos> - No, you didn't!
I'm not so sure that's a good idea.<eos> - You afraid of me?<eos> - Of course I'm afraid of you.<eos> Well, I'm afraid of you too.<eos> Then why do you want me to stay?<eos> Because I'm more afraid of being alone.<eos> I'll take the couch.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> I had a child to hold.<eos> I don't anymore.
Then I need you to accept this.<eos> What if I had an idea where maybe we can both get what we want?<eos> I'm listening.<eos> That's never happened to me before.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> Black Hawk Down.<eos> First of all, that's an amazing movie, and you should be proud that you are associated with it.<eos> And second of all, I think I know what the problem is.<eos> You do?
And has this bad behavior tarnished the image of the Black Pedals?<eos> [ Chuckles ] Not at all.<eos> Actually, before I hit the paparazzo, ticket sales for our new tour were in the crapper.<eos> But after I punched that jerk out, ticket sales went through the roof.<eos> No further questions.<eos> The triumph of your recent fisticuffs aside, isn't it true that in the last three months, you've trashed four hotel rooms, urinated from a balcony, appeared in a sex tape, and vomited on an audience member?<eos> Mm. Yes.<eos> Under any set of facts, that behavior would be cause enough for removal from a corporate board.<eos> Does the plaintiff have anything else to proffer?<eos> Yes, we do, Your Honor.
- Hey.<eos> So, they ain't gonna try him as an adult?<eos> That's good news.<eos> You want a drink?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't want a drink.<eos> - Something wrong? - Kendal didn't shoot that man.<eos> - He tell you that?<eos> Well, he didn't have to. - I know my own goddamn son, Darryl.<eos> - You do, huh?
Gabi, chop chop.<eos> Yolanda, mop mop.<eos> Okay, "pancakes, bacon".<eos> Um, how does Josh like his eggs?<eos> Like you. Over easy.<eos> Oh, and one tiny little thing.<eos> For dinner tonight, you need to prepare an authentic Chinese meal for four investors flying in from Shanghai.<eos> No pressure, but it does have to be perfect.<eos> Your resume did say you were familiar with Guangzhou-style cooking.<eos> It did?
He gave me a "C" on my last test.<eos> I don't get C's. I can't get C's.<eos> You really disappoint me trying to pull something over on me and, secondly, thinking that you could pull something over on me.<eos> I'm sorry, but this teacher is like some sadistic monster who hates the young.<eos> You know, I'll bet he orders veal even though he doesn't like veal just so they have to torture another little calf to make more veal.<eos> Why don't we have more veal?<eos> [Sighs] You know, a lot of other parents complain about this Hardin.<eos> He holds the kids to a ridiculously high standard.<eos> I like this guy.<eos> Yeah, of course you do.
- Shut up.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> The bad news is the Patriots just found our last safe house.<eos> It's only a matter of time before they find us here.<eos> But there's good news, right, Miles?<eos> Because Miles let the kid go, so we can all die with a clean conscience.<eos> Yeah, I'm really sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I made it harder for you and your kid to get your discount empire back.<eos> Oh, you didn't think we knew.<eos> We do.
That's Amber.<eos> But if she's being forced to take out money, why is she alone?<eos> She isn't. See that shadow?<eos> Stop. Who is she with?<eos> No way to see his face.<eos> Let it play.<eos> Let's see what happens next.<eos> This isn't a kidnapping.<eos> See the way he's touching her right there?<eos> I do.
Actually, she didn't - that's why I didn't mention it last night.<eos> Everything looks absolutely in order.<eos> Nothing that needs to be altered.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Everything was left to her husband, unless he predeceased her, in which case, her estate would go straight to her son, Ben.<eos> Her husband died a few years ago.<eos> And I was able to tell her not to worry about it.<eos> Her son would still inherit on her death.<eos> Did she say why she felt the need to check her will?<eos> No, she didn't.
OK?<eos> See, you're right.<eos> Sorry, you WERE right, I mean.<eos> To feel that way.<eos> It's exactly how it was.<eos> For me too.<eos> What?<eos> I thought if we could get away, start anew, find something different together, find something exciting... ..get out of our soggy blob, we could be like we used to be.<eos> That's what I wanted too.<eos> Only you didn't, did you, Sal?
Oh, yeah.<eos> I'm not gonna be one of those grooms who doesn't eat.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Hey.<eos> Thanks for being so supportive all day.<eos> Best man...<eos> whatever you need, I will do.<eos> Actually, there is one thing.<eos> Do you have a pen I could borrow to sign these forms?<eos> You bet I don't have a pen.<eos> I never do.
Vivian!<eos> Jake, you're so sweet!<eos> Charles told me you insisted that I come to breakfast.<eos> Because of it being such an important one.<eos> Meal, I mean.<eos> You know that in ancient Egypt, the peasants drank beer for breakfast?<eos> Well, that explains why all their buildings were crooked.<eos> Charles, can I see you in the bathroom for a second?<eos> I've got a mole on my back that needs a looking-at, and Charles has eyes.<eos> I do.
Thanks for helping me move my stuff, you guys. ♪ Lots of hairy boxes God, I've fallen. ♪<eos> Almost below you now, Nick.<eos> Fellow passengers, stuck in the caboose of life.<eos> You think I'm in the caboose of life?<eos> You love it in the caboose, not me.<eos> It hurts.<eos> It's actually quite jarring.<eos> ♪ Loves it in the caboose<eos> - I don't love it in the caboose.<eos> - ♪ Yes, he does.
- I may know him better than you do.<eos> I did not plan to kill my father.<eos> You killed your dad?<eos> I had another baby.<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> I did know.<eos> Vikram told me.<eos> I know where he kept the adoption papers.<eos> - Do you want to find your child?<eos> - Of course I do.
I didn't...<eos> - So I don't know, maybe he thought... that was his chance<eos> - to finally...<eos> - Whitney, your dad is not a killer.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> You don't know him.<eos> You just met him.<eos> Okay, you're right, I... I may not know your dad, but I do know for sure that he did not kill Vikram.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do, okay?
- I just came to get some of my stuff.<eos> - Drop what you're taking.<eos> It's evidence.<eos> You girls need to leave right now.<eos> Man: Don't forget to check for fingerprints on any surface.<eos> Man #2: Yo, come over here.<eos> So I have a sister?<eos> I mean half, but...<eos> Yeah.<eos> You do.
That's probably what he wanted to tell you that night.<eos> Isn't that something?<eos> Knowing he did that for me?<eos> So how does it feel to be in the 2010s?<eos> Eh, it's okay.<eos> I'm ready to say goodbye to the '70s, say goodbye to Vince.<eos> Well, then let's do it the right way.<eos> Honor the times along with the man.<eos> Castle, tell me you don't mean...<eos> Oh, but I do.
I mean, we thought he'd never notice.<eos> Everybody out.<eos> It's all a misunderstanding.<eos> It's not a misunderstanding.<eos> We'll be laughing about this in 24 hours.<eos> Gordon, you're wrong.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Did you know about this?<eos> - I didn't know anything about this.<eos> Yes, you did.
You know, that is... That's not a decision you need to make right now, Stella.<eos> But with Isabel's father, it was just sex sex sex all the time.<eos> It never stopped.<eos> Sounds like hell.<eos> But you helped me realize that there's more to that in a relationship.<eos> You know, there's compatibility and kindness.<eos> Just hanging out and getting to know each other.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.

Your phone isn't ringing day and night.<eos> You don't live in some shitty wackup.<eos> And there's no way "some dope" pays for a nightclub.<eos> Whatever you're doing ain't a goddamn hobby.<eos> Tell me the truth, Tommy.<eos> I'm at the top of the food chain.<eos> I got a crew of motherfuckers hustling for me, and we move serious weight.<eos> If I go away, I go away for good.<eos> You wanted the truth.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Sorry.<eos> But as a private citizen, you can't invoke that protection.<eos> In fact, only the AUSA can make that assertion, and I'm guessing...<eos> Yeah, by the look on his face, he's very interested in your answer.<eos> I am.<eos> But I don't think that this is the right venue.<eos> Well, you know, you could take Mr. Redmund into the SCIF and force him to tell you the whole truth and nothing but.<eos> There's no reason for me to testify in the SCIF, Ms. Bingum.<eos> Actually, I think that's a great idea.<eos> As does the government.
You can't kill me, Rumple.<eos> I saw Regina take your dagger.<eos> She gave it to Belle.<eos> And she wants me dead.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Well, then, you'll have to do what she wishes.<eos> If she has the dagger, you have no choice.<eos> Yes.<eos> If she has the dagger.<eos> But she doesn't.
I'll bleed out in 90 seconds.<eos> From what I've seen, it's not a bad way to go.<eos> - Avery...<eos> - I have a scalpel in my kit.<eos> It's so sharp I won't even feel it.<eos> - Stop.<eos> I'm thinking.<eos> - You're running out of time.<eos> I know, I'm thinking.<eos> Just do it, okay?
Well, maybe you should just get a whore.<eos> I think one of my old roommates is an actual whore.<eos> She was cute.<eos> She's probably ruined in her area,<eos> - but she is a... whore.<eos> - I don't... it's not...<eos> - I don't want a whore.<eos> - I wish Greg would give<eos> - me permission to bang a stranger.<eos> - No, you do not.

- That's gross.<eos> - Don't be so old-fashioned.<eos> - You are a buzzkill.<eos> - This is not going well.<eos> I don't...<eos> - No, it's going so poorly.<eos> - I find you very<eos> - attractive, I just don't want...<eos> - I actually have other tables.<eos> - Yeah, sure you do.
Really?<eos> _<eos> You know, I've always wondered what the inside of this place looks like.<eos> My... my wife used to actually come here and get waxed all the time.<eos> That was, uh, that was before we had kids, obviously.<eos> Just... Ow.<eos> Lately, she's, uh, really let things go, down there.<eos> Kind of looks like a pirate.<eos> Did you say something?<eos> No, I did not.
- husband to please be nice to me? - Lina:<eos> Uh, where is your husband?<eos> Oh, my grandfather husband is a million years old, and so he's asleep, and I'm here. Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> It's very important.<eos> Russ: Be right back.<eos> Jess: So, there's this guy at work.<eos> Uh-huh. Jess: And things have been getting a little bit out of control.<eos> Russ: Oh, I thought you had a thing about work.<eos> - Jess:<eos> I do. I do.
Hi! - AJ: The party has arrived.<eos> Hi.<eos> Welcome to my ex-home.<eos> Try not to slip on my tears. (Chuckles) Come in.<eos> This is my friend, Russ.<eos> - He's even crazier than I am. - Russ:<eos> Uh, no. I am not crazy.<eos> But I do...<eos> I do have issues.<eos> I do, yeah.
Lina: 'Cause my husband would never do anything this stupid.<eos> - Russ: Wait.<eos> - Lina: And if he did, he certainly wouldn't blame it on anyone else, right, honey?<eos> - Russ: I don't need your sad, boring old couple advice, okay?<eos> - Kim: I don't... I'm doing just fine alone.<eos> Tyler: Babe, you should just take a ride in it.<eos> Russ: Do you remember when we were that dumb?<eos> - Lina: Baby, you're still that dumb.<eos> - I know, but that's how you like it.<eos> - Lina: I do.
- Care to elaborate on that?<eos> - Not particularly.<eos> You're saying I should trust him.<eos> I'm saying I do.<eos> I'd ask how you're holding up, but I can see the answer.<eos> [Sighs] Not well.<eos> I can only imagine what these last couple of days have been like for you.<eos> But I'm telling you, it's gonna be okay.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Well, maybe you didn't have him sign it, but I know when he signed it, and it's not gonna hold up.<eos> It'll hold up just fine.<eos> We'll see.<eos> This is a subpoena.<eos> So the next time we have this conversation, you'll be under oath.<eos> What exactly is he claiming?<eos> He's saying Quentin wasn't competent when he made me executor.<eos> So let him say it.<eos> I don't see where there's a problem.<eos> Yes, you do.

- Me.<eos> Friend?<eos> Louis, I may not ever say it, but that's not because we aren't.<eos> We are.<eos> You know it.<eos> I know it.<eos> I just don't like to say it.<eos> Last time I asked you, you said, "don't push it."<eos> You knew I meant yes.<eos> I did.
- It isn't.<eos> But forgiveness isn't about right and wrong.<eos> Louis, I know you value the letter of the law, but what about its spirit?<eos> Because Mike embodies that spirit more than either one of us.<eos> You said we're friends.<eos> A friend would not ask me to do this.<eos> No, Louis.<eos> A friend just won't hold it against you if you don't.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
- That's great!<eos> That's exactly what you wanted. How did you do that?<eos> Well, Daniel and I came up with a plan.<eos> My father didn't know what hit him.<eos> Daniel?<eos> Are you sure he has your best interests at heart?<eos> I couldn't have gotten my magazine back without him.<eos> He's not the bad person you think he is.<eos> - You don't know him.<eos> - Yes, I do, Jack.
We caught up. We went back to his place.<eos> His place?<eos> Does that mean...<eos> Well, let's just say I earned a little extra credit.<eos> Teacher has a new pet.<eos> I finished top of my class...<eos> Stop.<eos> Sounds like you two have a nice thing.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
This is gonna be magical.<eos> You ready?<eos> Bring it.<eos> Bring it. All right.<eos> Wh-what's the matter?<eos> Why are you stopping?<eos> Um, you're my best friend's sister and I'm having a hard time doing this and not thinking about Stuart.<eos> - Oh, really? - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Ha. Does Stuart have these?<eos> Nuh, no. No, he does not.
Yes!<eos> Your spirit guides are on fire!<eos> The majority of people have dark hair.<eos> Even you, at one time.<eos> Does she work in a similar field to you?<eos> Ha! The opposite.<eos> She's a neurobiologist, and I'm a theoretical physicist.<eos> My spirit guides can go suck an egg.<eos> They're telling me that you have difficulty being close with her.<eos> Oh, he does.
You've seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.<eos> Leonard, we can't protect him forever.<eos> I know, but...<eos> He'll be okay.<eos> You taught him well, Padawan.<eos> Good Lord!<eos> Padawan's the student, not the teacher.<eos> Seriously, let him go.<eos> Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I'm not gonna stand in your way.<eos> I do.
- And what did he say?<eos> I just wanted to find out if it was him.<eos> You didn't tell him that I needed to speak to him?<eos> He was at home, dad.<eos> It looked like he had guests.<eos> I have told you how important this is.<eos> You've been telling me that for two weeks.<eos> I get it, dad.<eos> I get it, really.<eos> No, you don't.
I'll just tell him that I tried, you know, so...<eos> Hey.<eos> Did your dad draw that?<eos> I don't know who drew it.<eos> He's had it forever.<eos> It's a Hundjager.<eos> You know what that is?<eos> Yeah, do you?<eos> No.<eos> Does your dad?
Drop your weapons, step away from the car.<eos> Detective Griffin, Portland pd.<eos> If that gun doesn't hit the ground in another second, you will.<eos> Get on the ground, now.<eos> All of you.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah. You?<eos> Yeah, we're good.<eos> I thought you were gonna tell her to stay inside.<eos> He did.
I just... Wanted to say that I thought what you said at dinner was really nice.<eos> And, you know, I really appreciate how you've come around to Rosalee and me.<eos> It was my problem, not yours.<eos> And now that we've gotten to know her, that girl of yours is pretty special.<eos> There will always be some who won't agree, but I'm just glad I'm not one of them anymore.<eos> Thanks, dad.<eos> See you in the morning.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you smell smoke?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What, enemies that chop people's heads off?<eos> We better contact the FBI if this is really one of their guys.<eos> And I'll keep trying to contact Nick.<eos> It is the life you saved with that brick...<eos> I now give to you heart and soul.<eos> Now and forever.<eos> "I waited in the dark most of the night.<eos> "When the treacherous beast returned, I cut off its head."<eos> Do you have the ring?<eos> I do.
And you told me you were here to end the Negro apprentice system and then you were going home.<eos> Well, it ended and you stayed, why?<eos> I have a reason.<eos> Should I be worried?<eos> No - you couldn't look at another woman the way you look at me.<eos> It's not another woman.<eos> So what is it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You just don't want us to be together?<eos> I do.
Don't want to lose your job.<eos> Better than losing my sweetheart.<eos> Will you forgive me?<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> Go on!<eos> I'd never have believed I'd be so grateful to have children that sleep.<eos> If I'd known how much having a baby would hurt me.<eos> I still can't cough without consequences.<eos> No wonder Lucy's planning on ending up an old maid.<eos> I don't!
If there's a kinder, more Christian person in this country, I've yet to meet them.<eos> Mrs Greg?<eos> Peter.<eos> I'm sorry to intrude.<eos> I heard you're not well.<eos> If there's anything I can do.<eos> Oh, that's very kind of you, Peter.<eos> If I may ask, did you ever hear back from Dr Bremner?<eos> It's been a couple of months.<eos> I did...
Amanda?<eos> Can you sleep next to me?<eos> Okay.<eos> It'll be like when we built forts out of oil drums. Oh... And we fell asleep listening to the gunfire.<eos> All night long.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Mom was so mad.<eos> Oh, she was so mad.<eos> But we had each other, didn't we?<eos> We still do.
- I'm not sure.<eos> You want to be mayor again.<eos> I'm helping, whispering in his ear, steering him.<eos> It's enough.<eos> Nothing is ever enough for Amanda Rosewater.<eos> Oh, no, come on.<eos> That's not true.<eos> You love being the boss.<eos> - I don't love being the boss.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Irisa...<eos> I love you.<eos> More than... anyone I've ever loved in my life.<eos> And I don't ever want to spend any time apart from you.<eos> I want to make you my wife, and I want to be your husband.<eos> Why?<eos> Because that's what you do when you love someone.<eos> When you know they're the one, you make a commitment forever.<eos> You don't want to marry me.<eos> Yes, I do, with all my heart.
"'Only a moron would ever live anywhere other than Pawnee, Indiana.'<eos> Leslie Knope, multiple occasions."<eos> I can cut a new plinth with a less ironic inscription.<eos> This is so touching, you guys.<eos> I am crying out of happiness and sadness and gratitude and because I'm carrying triplets and for a fifth reason that I can't figure out.<eos> Leslie, don't cry.<eos> It's not that great.<eos> It doesn't even look like you.<eos> Or, actually, you know what?<eos> It kind of does.
Matty had responded with one single letter.<eos> Was he just in a hurry, or was that all he had to say?<eos> Confused, desperate, and a little high, I turned to the first person I could for answers. Ouch.<eos> "K." Well, "KK" is the only polite way to respond to a text unless you want some loser to get the hint and stop texting you.<eos> That's when you write "K."<eos> I mean, I take "K" as an insult.<eos> Does that help?<eos> _<eos> Cookie Monster didn't have a mustache.<eos> Neither did that super mean dog.
He left the prison in a hurry, but his toiletries were missing from his house, and there was no suitcase there.<eos> He obviously went back to his home even though he knew he was taking a risk.<eos> I think that he might have gone back to pick up his dog.<eos> Did Rockland PD mention anything about animals at the residence?<eos> Rings where the bowls would have been.<eos> That's well-spotted, Watson.<eos> I'll revise the BOLO.<eos> Advise them the suspect may be traveling with his pet.<eos> No, I did not know they made a model for dentures based on Aaron's mouth.<eos> None of us did.
Aaron Colville has been dead for years, but someone with his teeth killed two women a month ago.<eos> Yes, but if Colville killed those woman in 2005, this may suggest motive.<eos> Whoever's committing the murders in the present day wants us to know about the dentures.<eos> They want to cast doubt on who killed those women all those years ago.<eos> Why would anybody do that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Not yet.<eos> The question becomes: Who stands to benefit most from Aaron Colville's exoneration?<eos> ...based on Aaron's mouth.<eos> None of us did.
It's 'cause of her we have bedtimes!<eos> Chris, come on, we're going home!<eos> He can't make you do this.<eos> But, Mom, I wantto do this.<eos> What?<eos> I know he's marrying me for my money, but I don't care.<eos> Dad and I spent more time together planning this wedding than we ever have before.<eos> And if being married means I get to spend even more time with my dad, then it's worth it.<eos> Wait. You knew all along I just wanted you for your money?<eos> Yeah, Dad, I did.
Yes, it's called progress.<eos> Get with the times, old man. Who's gonna pay to fix this?<eos> Who's gonna pay for my carriage? Disgraceful.<eos> Disgraceful?<eos> The blinders are for the horse, not you!<eos> As if you could see anything with all that smoke.<eos> Horses should be plowing fields, not on the road!<eos> You shouldn't be on the road in that damn thing.<eos> I had the right of way.<eos> Never you did!
If she needs help, she tells us.<eos> Now that all patients evacuated to start.<eos> Gilit We were together at the Officers' Course.<eos> On the 12th base.<eos> We have overcome many obstacles together, and it is for me as a twin sister.<eos> Please Gilit.<eos> What do I do when I see a suspicious approaching the base?<eos> What, like... like a soldier, an impostor?<eos> No, really suspicious.<eos> What do I do?
- Mm-hmm. - That...<eos> Shouldn't be a problem.<eos> My boss will be there.<eos> It's kind of a big-deal event.<eos> Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.<eos> - I go every year. - Mm-hmm.<eos> And it's always plus-one.<eos> And everyone's always like, "where's your plus-one?<eos> "why are you alone?" I just never had a plus-one that I wanted to bring.<eos> And this year I do.
Oh, hi, Dr. Sam.<eos> Will said you'd be here, and I wanted to be the first to greet you.<eos> You should know that our doors are always open to you.<eos> Thank you, Marcus.<eos> You're an excellent greeter.<eos> So did you save any lives today?<eos> I bet you did.<eos> I think you have the coolest job ever.<eos> Did you know one of my real-life dreams was to ride in an ambulance?<eos> I didn't, but...
No escape.<eos> [footbot beeping weakly] - Get me that vial before stinkman uses it.<eos> That retro-mutagen belongs to me.<eos> - It's gaining on us!<eos> - Firing garbage cannon!<eos> - Mmm, delicious.<eos> [groaning] - Now a left!<eos> Dad's this way. Whoa-oa!<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do.
Vincent, last night was...<eos> Incredible.<eos> No, I was gonna say, it was a mistake.<eos> Come on, it wasn't a mistake.<eos> I mean, it felt pretty real to me, right?<eos> It must have meant something?<eos> No.<eos> It was break-up sex, that's all.<eos> You don't really believe that, do you?<eos> Yes, I do.

I just want to know how long it's gonna take.<eos> Oh, so now you want answers.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No.<eos> Come on, you started it, what does that mean?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I sent you flowers.<eos> We spent the night in a hotel together, but you act like nothing ever happened and I don't like it.<eos> You don't.

Protect?<eos> I don't need you to protect me from anything.<eos> I'm sorry, that's not what I meant.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Be honest.<eos> Okay, you want honesty?<eos> You may think that Vincent has changed, you may even believe that he actually has, but I used to be what he is, and I know sooner or later, he is going to hurt you...<eos> Gabe and you will be sorry! Gabe, please.<eos> The only thing I am sorry about is that things didn't work out between us, because I cared about you.<eos> I still do.

She just really wanted to have a chance to plead her case.<eos> That was out of line.<eos> I already said no.<eos> I know it was wrong.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She doesn't meet the criteria.<eos> It's that simple.<eos> I know it's hard because they're kids and they're dying.<eos> And they've got their stories and lives and family...<eos> Well, she doesn't!
And they've got their stories and lives and family...<eos> Well, she doesn't!<eos> - Her parents don't talk to her.<eos> - Ross, stop it.<eos> You're too emotionally involved, and you've gotten her hopes up.<eos> It's gonna be worse on her when you tell her no.<eos> Do your job.<eos> Do you have my discharge papers?<eos> Uh no.<eos> No, no, I don't.
D... To the point that I don't have to say a word.<eos> She just... she just looks at me and sees who I am and how I feel... and accepts it.<eos> You know, she doesn't try to change it, doesn't want to change it.<eos> That person.<eos> There's a billion people out there.<eos> But I imagine... there's only one her.<eos> I am happy to sign the document.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> I don't have a pen.<eos> No, sweetheart, you don't...
Uh, well, I'm ...<eos> I'm trying to find out what happened to you.<eos> I'm going to take scrapings to see if there's any tissues underneath your fingernails.<eos> - So, you like the Red Sox?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Do you have a favorite player?<eos> - Dustin Pedroia.<eos> Most defensive runs saved at his position over the last three years.<eos> - He's got a nice smile.<eos> - Yes, he does.
How do you know I haven't cried yet?<eos> Because you would have said, "I had a good cry and it didn't help," or something like that.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I think I've moved through denial and anger.<eos> I'm ready to move into bargaining and I'll have a good cry when I get to depression.<eos> - Can't plan a cry, Maura.<eos> - I'm not planning it.<eos> I'm just narrowing down the window of its arrival.<eos> And it occurred to me today that ... that we need to talk about our last wishes.<eos> - No, we don't.
I swear I'll fix this.<eos> I can.<eos> If you just give me a chance, I promise.<eos> Toby.<eos> I'm so sorry, sweetie.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Tell me what you remember.<eos> No, he was a good man.<eos> I think he just lost his way, you know?<eos> I do.
What if Pedro Luis had not been murdered?<eos> Would he have been in Naples instead of de Cordova and guaranteed my safe passage back to the Romagna?<eos> What if the malarial fever had not plagued both father and son?<eos> If the reign of Pope Alexander had lasted another year, or even six months, would I now be emperor of Italy?<eos> What if Lucrezia and I had consummated our love?<eos> "What if" is a game for philosophers and school boys.<eos> You are neither.<eos> Tonight, you were in a battle for the first time since you were captured.<eos> I once said, your eyes held no fear.<eos> Now they do.
Yeah.<eos> Well, we got a photo, though, right?<eos> I mean, dashboard camera from the car stop?<eos> You know, proof he's our guy.<eos> No, sir, my camera hasn't worked for weeks.<eos> But Molly's got a picture.<eos> It's in the file.<eos> She showed me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - She did?
I will get disqualified.<eos> But it is fine.<eos> I am sure my body is almost done absorbing all the poison, and then I will feel good as new.<eos> Sue, this is crazy.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> No!<eos> It's all good!<eos> The-- the burning in my face is distracting me from the shooting pain down my arm.<eos> I'm gonna win this thing, Darrin.<eos> Yeah, but what if you don't?
That is incorrect.<eos> And we're down to our final two.<eos> I told you.<eos> This is Brick's year.<eos> Look at him up there.<eos> He's got the eye of the tiger.<eos> Your word is... succedaneum.<eos> We got this.<eos> He knows this one.<eos> He does?

We're moving to Trousdale, kids are going to private school.<eos> Trousdale?<eos> What is this, 1966 and you're Nancy fucking Sinatra?<eos> Hey.<eos> George Hamilton called...<eos> he wants his bag back.<eos> The office just got a call from a woman at Peet's who said your father had applied for a job there and they want his address.<eos> Did you give it to 'em?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Lupita did.
Wow.<eos> You two are just so cute, I could just eat you up.<eos> Give me some of that sugar!<eos> Hey, get over here, Peg!<eos> I'm good.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> I forgot. You weren't much of a hugger.<eos> Unless it involved a boy and the backseat of a car.<eos> Kay, they don't need to hear all that.<eos> Yeah, we really don't.
Watch me.<eos> If I can do it to a sister, I can do it to her.<eos> Mike has an aunt?<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Are you through?<eos> No.<eos> And neither is Kay.<eos> You know, your best friend is at a funeral home saying good-bye to her mother right now.<eos> And she wants you there.<eos> No, she doesn't.

Let's go.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Go serve the people don't just sit around here.<eos> Just taking a quick break.<eos> A break?<eos> Why you!<eos> - Don't go to school on Friday.<eos> - Why?<eos> Just don't!
It will be a, uh, very careful, very precise... yank.<eos> Oh, me!<eos> Me, me, me!<eos> [monitor beeping] [scoffs] Do I have to do that thing where I acknowledge the losers?<eos> 'Cause I have like five minutes.<eos> I don't want to waste it on people I don't even know.<eos> Mm, it is a courtesy.<eos> [sighs] You're nervous.<eos> You know, I know you think that I'm too busy, but I can make it work, if you don't want to be alone.<eos> But I do.
I'm not... you know what?<eos> I don't owe you an explanation.<eos> I have a girlfriend who I just took to Paris.<eos> There were hands in the pants at the Louvre, and that's all you need to know.<eos> Mr. Mansfield.<eos> Brody!<eos> What's up, man?<eos> Does Mansfield know you're using his office?<eos> Does Mansfield know I'm using his office?<eos> No, he does not.
Just because you guys broke up doesn't mean we have to.<eos> I called her to talk about the show and, you know, what happened, and we started reminiscing about how we all used to watch together...<eos> - And... she said she's been meaning to call you about something, that the two of you need to talk.<eos> Need to talk?<eos> Talk about what?<eos> Like talk talk?<eos> About us?<eos> Is that... Does she want to get back together?<eos> - Did you get everything?<eos> - I didn't...
- Oz, be careful what you say.<eos> - What are you, my mom?<eos> Coward.<eos> - Hey, was that Tia? - What?<eos> Oh, tha... w...<eos> There's a lot of girls in here.<eos> It's hard to keep track.<eos> I just wanted to come by and say I'm sorry.<eos> Mm. You didn't need to do that.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Sounds like a good time to sneak something onto the set without anyone noticing.<eos> Do you remember seeing Raven or Gabriella at that time?<eos> I saw Raven after lunch, headed into a dressing room.<eos> - You're OK?<eos> - Sorry, yeah.<eos> I've just been...<eos> - getting these headaches.<eos> - The last time we met.<eos> - I remember.<eos> -'Course you do.
They released his name.<eos> Who told that journalist?<eos> Someone wanted to make it look like an accident, but that kid wasn't up here.<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> I told you.<eos> I was working.<eos> If you or someone you know has any information, please come forward now.<eos> We will catch whoever did this.<eos> You had a nightmare.<eos> - I did?
Can I say something?<eos> You're not here to train me.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> I know how to handle people.<eos> So you can keep your brooding, assaholic, big city cop act to yourself.<eos> Sir.<eos> Potato chips?<eos> Why don't we have any potato chips in this house?<eos> You don't want potato chips.<eos> No, I do.
Fine!<eos> You win!<eos> Tell charles.<eos> Hold me close, little wolfie.<eos> Hold me.<eos> (jake) all right, convict.<eos> What do you know about the murder of nate dexter?<eos> Look, I'll tell you the same thing... I told you eight years ago.<eos> I don't know anything about nate dexter.<eos> And even if I did...
What kept you?<eos> I'm sorry for making you wait.<eos> Is there something you need to tell me, Pascal?<eos> Let's begin our life away from here now.<eos> We can leave the party... Take the plane to Corsica.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - We must.<eos> I love you.<eos> You do believe me, don't you?<eos> I do.
- I can take her down, because I have something she doesn't have:<eos> You guys.<eos> Now, strategies.<eos> What about you, coach?<eos> You hook up at weddings all the time.<eos> What's your strategy?<eos> It's called being a gorgeous black man with the body of an action figure.<eos> I could give that a try.<eos> You want to know what your ex-boyfriend thinks you should do to get the guy?<eos> No, I don't.
Wait a minute.<eos> Looks like a partial print.<eos> It could be a tented arch.<eos> Sara said she found a tented arch at the Roger Mathers murder scene.<eos> I got your text.<eos> You said it was urgent.<eos> I was looking through the evidence from the '89 case, and I found a fingerprint.<eos> It's only a partial-- not enough to run.<eos> Don't tell me it has a tented arch.<eos> It does.
Why don't we all go?<eos> So, why are they taking all of us?<eos> Why do you think?<eos> Husband, wife, future husband, your apartment.<eos> When they find our dead bodies, the story of jealous rage writes itself.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Mickey, trust me...<eos> you don't want to do this.<eos> Trust me...<eos> I do.
I hate to say it, but I'm beginning to think that we could benefit from a little bit of that Weaver "no."<eos> Whoa, some spread, huh?<eos> Mm-mm-mmm, celery. ♪ balle balle<eos> I think I just saw an alien on a unicycle, swinging a sword.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I saw that, too.<eos> I bet their kids don't reject them.<eos> Those guys know how to have fun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, they do.

I don't know.<eos> I-I saw it on a bill earlier today.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I want to say Justin...<eos> Department of Water and Power?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What's up?<eos> Um... Not exactly sure how to start this convo.<eos> Uh... "Danny said you need help with phone sex"?<eos> [Chuckles] Of course he did.
A poem of some kind.<eos> Supposed to mean something to Joe.<eos> That's all she would say, so you need to talk to Claire.<eos> Hey.<eos> You should go home, get some rest.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Ok. Look.<eos> I know I've got no right to tell you what you should and shouldn't do...<eos> You're right.<eos> You don't.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is the police.<eos> Drop your guns.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Andreas is inside.<eos> You don't know whose operation this is.<eos> Oh, I do.
Waste removal was on your list.<eos> But I checked it.<eos> Clearly, not very well.<eos> Maybe I would have caught it if I wasn't racing around measuring soap dispensers.<eos> I covered for you, so Dr. J thinks I screwed up.<eos> I told you to focus on three things.<eos> - The drug lockup...<eos> - I was doing my job.<eos> - I made a decision.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Put that down!<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> Are you breaking into my store?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Why would you even say that?<eos> My alarm went off.<eos> Oh, well, okay, that is a coincidence because his tuxedo is in there, and we're getting married in an hour.<eos> You are totally saving us.<eos> You know, I freak out at situations like this, which forces him to fix the problem, you know?<eos> I do.
_<eos> I know.<eos> I'll text you after I talk with him.<eos> I cannot believe that I took a pill yesterday to prevent me from becoming pregnant.<eos> I could have had a thing growing inside me that could have turned into a person.<eos> Yeah, that image of you and Emmett as teen parents is kind of freaking me out right now.<eos> So what's going on with you and Tank?<eos> He and I... Never really clicked like that.<eos> I kept trying to make it work.<eos> And it never did.
You're fine.<eos> You were stabbed five times.<eos> You'll live.<eos> Sonya, give this man a tampon and... I don't know... hold his hand.<eos> You're an asshole.<eos> - He's gonna help us.<eos> Alfredo armas.<eos> I met the man himself.<eos> You didn't.<eos> I kind of did.
I now know why they have those stickers for lorry drivers -<eos> "If you can't see my mirrors, I can't see you."<eos> 'Even though the incident had been technically my fault,<eos> 'I still followed the standard procedure.'<eos> What?<eos> He knows the rules.<eos> Live by the sword, you must...<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Something to do with swords.
We were partners when I first came up.<eos> Me and Jimmy worked the gang unit together with Alvin.<eos> Ivory tower recognized he'd be better served working undercover in Chinatown.<eos> Yeah, perfect place for him.<eos> He's got his own Vice squad now... all Chinese cops.<eos> All I can tell you is he was dressed like the guys in the video, and he was looking awfully cranked.<eos> So why don't we put a tail on him, see what's what?<eos> - 'Cause it ain't him.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Because I do.
Ow!<eos> I give! Uncle!<eos> Sorry.<eos> I liked you. you ran straight to me to get me out.<eos> Tanaka-kun!<eos> I'm getting you out!<eos> you fell straight down.<eos> My sides hurt just remembering it! I'm the loser for desperately clinging to my memories.<eos> I love you.<eos> and I do now.

Ah, I sense the stench of romance is in the air.<eos> I won't talk about her.<eos> That's not Victoria I was referencing.<eos> Well, it seems that the only kindness you'll grant me after I gave you leverage to get into her bed is to keep her out of this conversation.<eos> I owe you nothing, okay?<eos> You can look me in the eye and tell me that you're reneging on our deal instead of hiding out and playing house.<eos> And while you nurse the wounds of your new loss, I'm already breaking in to the South American market.<eos> You wouldn't know where to begin.<eos> Alberto Loya jumped at the mention of my name...<eos> Much like people once did at the mention of yours.
We're only going for a few days.<eos> I've just packed my flowiest dresses and some sensible stilettos.<eos> Okay, that's the shirt suitcase.<eos> Now for the pants.<eos> - Hey, sweetie.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Don't forget your bathing suit.<eos> The ocean in California is, like, the perfect temp.<eos> Um, nope.<eos> Abby Weaver does not do ocean.
Mr Nose - pardon me, I don't know you're real name.<eos> Marcus.<eos> Marcus Gallow.<eos> You must have balls as big as your nose to speak out like that.<eos> Thank you?<eos> The truth is not all this hair is mine.<eos> The sides are and I have very hirsute legs.<eos> I've thought to fashion some kind of comb over, but I opted for a small toupee.<eos> My wife doesn't know.<eos> Right. Suspect she does but...
We're this side.<eos> Why's he sitting over there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll just... Fab?<eos> Right.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> It's just sort of legal, you know, jargon.<eos> It looks like a big bum.<eos> Yeah, it does a bit.
It upset you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What did he want to know?<eos> Um... he showed me...<eos> He showed me two drawings of people, and some photos.<eos> Your parents?<eos> No, somebody else.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He just... he just wanted to know if I'd seen them before, if... if I knew who they were.<eos> Do you?
- Yeah.<eos> So, Henry has to write a report for school, about "My Hero."<eos> Naturally, I thought I'd be the shoo-in, but you can't write about your dad, so he would like to interview you.<eos> Wow, I'm... flattered.<eos> Well, I'm envious, 'cause you've made quite the impression, but I guess, um, a travel agent can't compete with the FBI.<eos> Except when it comes to cars.<eos> So, what's new?<eos> Nothing much. You?<eos> Can't complain.<eos> Do. Sandra home?
I just feel so responsible.<eos> We had this huge fight.<eos> And then I just left him all alone.<eos> If you'd been with him, he would've done the same thing.<eos> I want to kill whoever did this to him.<eos> Don't say that, Sam.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> I just wish he could hear me. So I could tell him I was here.<eos> He knows we're here.<eos> He does.
The man you raised.<eos> I'm glad you're okay.<eos> Just... don't do it again.<eos> Unless I'm right next to you.<eos> We'll take 'em together?<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you sure you're up for this?<eos> You just got out of the hospital.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> I do.
Yeah, things like a grenade launcher.<eos> You can't do that anymore, Reese.<eos> Neither of us can.<eos> We get caught, we get exposed, and then it's lights out.<eos> _<eos> Ugh. No means no, asshat.<eos> I need to get back to work.<eos> I might still need your help, Shaw.<eos> Did you not hear anything I just said?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Well, let's go arrest this guy.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Not so fast, McGruff.<eos> He hasn't committed a crime yet, but he's gonna-- trust me.<eos> Okay, how do you know that?<eos> That library in Dusseldorf was ancient.<eos> And the books inside it were period.<eos> The paper in those books-- 75% cotton, 25% ultrafine linen.<eos> You know what that means?<eos> I do.
What?<eos> Bishop.<eos> He wants me to cut your finger off.<eos> I told him you were OK, I didn't need to.<eos> You knew who your friends were. - I do.<eos> - Yeah, so that's why I'm here.<eos> To remind you.<eos> I mean, you talk to the SA, you ask about any kind of deal, you're dead.<eos> You understand?<eos> I do, I do. I do.
Okay.<eos> Hold this.<eos> Earl, what are you doing here?<eos> Oleg called me when he couldn't get Caroline to stop the screaming.<eos> Hi, Max.<eos> Earl gave me part of a brownie.<eos> Turns out, glaucoma and having hair stuck take the exact same prescription.<eos> Look!<eos> That's right, you mothers!<eos> I did it!
I'm really nervous.<eos> Don't be.<eos> You are built for pharmaceutical sales.<eos> You're cute, you're flirty and...<eos> Started that like there were gonna be three things.<eos> I don't have any experience in sales.<eos> Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school.<eos> But you already made me take that off my résumé.<eos> This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos 'cause they're about to go bad, you're just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.<eos> They do?
I know.<eos> You made a promise to Nolan.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And your loyalty is honorable.<eos> But this is a business decision, and you must consider all your options.<eos> Why don't you think about it on your test drive?<eos> This is a key to a McLaren.<eos> - How did you know that's my favorite car?<eos> - I asked your program.<eos> Oh, of course you did.
Are you okay?<eos> You're breathing kind of funny.<eos> You know, it's just... keep going for the study.<eos> Now what's he's doing?<eos> Are you sure you want to know?<eos> Tell me.<eos> He is whispering into her ear,<eos> "I want you."<eos> And she likes it.<eos> Oh, yeah, she does.
- I did. Monday.<eos> Until Sunday, is it?<eos> Two days at Stavassgárden!<eos> That's nice.<eos> - I'll be working out, running...<eos> - It's still nice, isn't it?<eos> - Move!<eos> - You just have to ask.<eos> - You can see what I'm holding.<eos> - No, I didn't.
This is my chance.<eos> It can't go on like before.<eos> Something needs to change.<eos> Now I can do something irreversible.<eos> Let myself disappear into another person.<eos> Then my life has to change.<eos> I know what you mean.<eos> - Do you have any siblings?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I... I don't.
As a reward for saving his life.<eos> Leith, Leith, sit down and take a breath.<eos> This is unbelievable.<eos> It's your chance to rise.<eos> You'd be a member of the merchant class.<eos> Oh, my family, they've been nothing but servants for generations.<eos> I'm the first to make it to the royal court.<eos> You'd serve no one but yourself.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Of course you do.
Mel light.<eos> All the Mel we love without the bitter aftertaste.<eos> So that's how the divorce papers affected dad.<eos> For mom, they meant dipping her toe in the online dating pool...<eos> With Katie's help.<eos> Hey, Mel, I can't talk right now.<eos> Katie and I...<eos> - I can talk.<eos> - Did you get the papers?<eos> I did.
You got to make up your mind, Beverly.<eos> Either I'm the jerk who's never there when you need him or I'm the white knight always trying to swoop in and save everybody.<eos> Pretty hard to be both.<eos> Yet you manage it so well.<eos> Makes it even worse.<eos> 'Cause you get people's hopes up and then you bail on them.<eos> Everything that's going on, you want to do this right now?<eos> Do what?<eos> Talk about things that actually matter?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Well, yeah.<eos> I already knew I wasn't a drug addict.<eos> So did I.<eos> When can I go back out?<eos> I think you been spending a lot of time worrying about what's gonna make me happy.<eos> Now's the time for you to think about what's gonna make you happy.<eos> I'm gonna ask you a question that I asked you before.<eos> I want you to answer me honestly.<eos> Do you want this?<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, she's back here somewhere with her sister.<eos> Said they had something to do with their mom. ï½♪ Tell me what you think... ï½♪ Can I ask you a question?<eos> I was wondering if you could tell me about the night... ï½♪ As long as it's somewhere ï½♪ The night that Maddie was born.<eos> Look, you raised a hell of a girl, Teddy.<eos> And you were there for all of it.<eos> Rayna labored most of the night at home.<eos> By the time we got to the hospital, they rushed us right into the delivery room, and Maddie was born right before sunrise.<eos> She came out crying.<eos> Man, she had a set of lungs on her.<eos> Still does.
Sarah is mad at you because of you.<eos> Me?<eos> It's all my fault, right?<eos> You're saying that it's all my fault.<eos> No.<eos> Sometimes people with asperger's take actions without realizing their effects on other people.<eos> So then you're saying it's asperger's fault, right?<eos> Do I have every right to be mad at asperger's?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
What did you need to see him about?<eos> I want to talk about what happened.<eos> Yeah, um, look, I know that we both agreed that a spin-off was the better way to go, but-- I don't want to talk about that.<eos> I want to talk about me.<eos> I want out.<eos> You want to leave Gianopolous because of what happened this morning?<eos> What happened this morning happens every day.<eos> He keeps people down when they reach a certain point, and I'm pretty sure I'm at that point.<eos> - Yeah, I get it.<eos> - No, you don't.

Sheila Amanda Sazs, you are the love of what I hope will be my very, very long life.<eos> And I can't spend one more second of it without you.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I'll marry you.<eos> Tony, what can I do for you?<eos> You screwed me over.<eos> By figuring out how to fire the guy you told us to fire?<eos> By telling my number two how to break his non-compete.<eos> - I did nothing of the kind.
What do you mean move to Boston?<eos> I'm not moving to Boston.<eos> You have to.<eos> You know what Harvard means to me.<eos> You know what Pearson Specter means to me.<eos> Okay, Louis, there are a dozen firms that would snap you up in a second there.<eos> Same goes for law schools here.<eos> Yeah, but they're not Harvard, which means they're second tier.<eos> You seriously expected me to drop everything and move to New York?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Well, then let us talk to her.<eos> We all just want to keep Chelsea safe.<eos> Okay.<eos> My dad and I like to play pretend.<eos> So what do you guys pretend?<eos> Cops and bad girls.<eos> My dad makes up stories for TV.<eos> If I remember my lines, I can be in one.<eos> So, Chelsea, you know the difference between truth and pretend?<eos> You do. Right, honey? Mmhmm.
Those are your orders.<eos> First -- soon, you need to tell her who you really are, who she really is, get her ready.<eos> Then, develop her until the time is right for you to tell her that she will join our ranks.<eos> It was unforgivable for them to go behind Emmet and Leanne's backs, but don't forget what's at stake in this war.<eos> A second-generation illegal could change everything, and, for the right child, it could give their life a meaning and a purpose that they could never get in this country.<eos> That's for us to decide.<eos> Paige is your daughter, but she's not just yours.<eos> She belongs to the cause.<eos> And to the world.<eos> We all do.
I just got you back.<eos> I'm not letting you go again.<eos> Especially if I know that people are after you.<eos> People are always gonna be after me, okay?<eos> I will be fine.<eos> Yeah, but I won't be.<eos> Look, I keep I saying that I need to move forward, but towards what?<eos> You know, maybe my moving forward is coming with you.<eos> Unless you don't want me to come?<eos> Of course I do.
Well?<eos> I feel sure that Mr. and Mrs. Wyse will fully understand why I felt the need to return your sketch.<eos> It was, after all, a fraud.<eos> - A fraud, dear?<eos> - Traced from a photograph.<eos> Strictly against Art Society rules.<eos> I merely wished to spare you the embarrassment of exposure, but since you give me no choice...<eos> I flatly deny the accusation.<eos> Do you? !<eos> Do you? !
And Cassie is my daughter.<eos> A synergist like Stephen.<eos> Stephen's mother is a paranormal?<eos> Oh, you didn't know?<eos> Oh, of course, that old familiar blind spot for family.<eos> A luxury I cannot afford.<eos> I had thought, perhaps, that Cassie would be up for the task, given her pedigree, but it was not to be.<eos> This would all be so much simpler if we still had your brother.<eos> Wouldn't it?<eos> But we don't.
I know.<eos> And now, the only way to free ourselves from our past is for you to kill the Founder.<eos> For better or worse, John, it's your destiny.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, stop this war.<eos> For all of us.<eos> This house if off-limits for Ultra.<eos> You're safe as long as you stay here.<eos> I thought you said Stephen needed help.<eos> He does.
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...<eos> I'm powerless.<eos> Regina's got my pendant.<eos> Want to meet your new uncle?<eos> I saw Regina take your dagger.<eos> - She gave it to Belle.<eos> - If she has the dagger, you'll have to do what she wishes.<eos> But she doesn't.
Mama?<eos> Roland?<eos> Oh, my baby!<eos> Roland!<eos> You.<eos> You did this.<eos> I just wanted to save her life.<eos> You're just like your mother... never thinking of consequences.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Of course you didn't.
That's interesting.<eos> Most major universities keep samples of anthrax for research purposes.<eos> You think the stuff that pickpocket swallowed came from Columbia?<eos> You could never steal that amount of anthrax without someone noticing it was gone from a secure lab.<eos> But given Mr. Simon's background, all he would need is a spore and a lab to start growing his own.<eos> I'm guessing it's the kind of lab he could set up in his house?<eos> Like I said, Charlie's not here.<eos> I don't think he came home last night.<eos> How do you and Mr. Simon know each other?<eos> We don't.
Just finished rehearsing for a new production.<eos> A small theater but a big role.<eos> He was looking forward to being back on the boards.<eos> Nothing unusual?<eos> No.<eos> What about Jeremy?<eos> What about Jeremy?<eos> Well, had you seen him recently?<eos> You know how it was between them.<eos> Yes, I do.
Bey.<eos> Well, according to your rap sheet, it's Kurt.<eos> Greenlee.<eos> Kurt Greenlee is a slave name issued to me by a corporate entity.<eos> I don't recognize the U.S. Government, so stop saying it.<eos> Call me Joe Bey.<eos> Mr. Bey, we know that Eugene MacIntosh is an associate of yours.<eos> If you say so.<eos> Actually, I don't;<eos> his brother does.
What are you working on?<eos> Proof that my brother is either an idiot or a criminal.<eos> I went to see Mycroft today.<eos> Why?<eos> This man was sitting at a corner table in his restaurant, the very same place he was sitting the last time I was there.<eos> He received a package at this table today.<eos> I better not have been the subject of this meeting.<eos> Course you were.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> It does...
Aw, come on.<eos> I'm Kenneth Benson. I'm Tiny!<eos> I belong in Southie.<eos> I just fuckin' came out here with Sully to do a job for you.<eos> You're gonna get...<eos> I ain't going!<eos> And you can't turn me into Bert fuckin' Handey.<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> You don't got a fuckin' choice.<eos> I do.
I know you're here to convince our community to come home with you.<eos> Your whole act is a lie.<eos> "Everyone love me.<eos> Everyone fall in love with me."<eos> You're completely full of a word that I would never be allowed to say on national television.<eos> People have always like me.<eos> It's true.<eos> And I won't lie...<eos> I've always had a way with the ladies.<eos> You really do!
Reggie... If you want to be human, I won't stop you, either.<eos> I'm all out of answers.<eos> Enough.<eos> But I...<eos> - I said "enough."<eos> Larry Bird, I have never doubted you on this mission...<eos> Not once.<eos> You said "name yourself Jackie Joyner-Kersee."<eos> You'll fit right in."<eos> I did it.
Um, can you take a break?<eos> There's something I wanna talk to you about. Oh, uh...<eos> Okay, wait, so you didn't get in trouble at all?<eos> It's nuts.<eos> Lately my parents have been so preoccupied with Katie seems I can get away with anything.<eos> Let's test it.<eos> So Katie told me about your plan for after the formal.<eos> About getting... Late-night pancakes?<eos> Come on, we both know what we're talking about.<eos> I didn't...
What are you talking about?<eos> It's a celebration.<eos> It's fun and games and free stuff for the baby.<eos> - I don't need it.<eos> - Okay. May I ask why?<eos> I decided to give the baby up for adoption.<eos> - I'm kind of liking these people.<eos> - Jeff and Suzanne Taylor.<eos> Bonnie: So... you want to adopt a baby?<eos> - Yes, we do.
Deb, find a test online.<eos> I'll get my slide rule.<eos> I'll find my brain crystals and thinking candle.<eos> So, you know...<eos> Oh, there's Doug.<eos> He's perfect for the stop-n-chat.<eos> If you want people to think you're down to earth, let them see you talking to Doug.<eos> Just be prepared... he's the kind of guy that butters both sides of the bagel.<eos> If you know what I mean. (Laughs)<eos> I-I-I... I do not.
You were sloppy.<eos> She wasn't supposed to be there, we should have had more time.<eos> You people don't have a handle on this.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> It must be a glitch.<eos> You said you had eyes on Alec Sadler?<eos> I'm looking at him right now!<eos> Are you certain?<eos> Because you said you had the contamination tracked.<eos> We do.
Jason.<eos> Jason, there's no one to betray here, ok?<eos> We're just talking about the bracelet and Alec would never do anything to hurt people, so-<eos> That's right, Alec would never do something to hurt people!<eos> Never.<eos> No, Alec Sadler will become a great man, and he wouldn't hurt anybody.<eos> You, murderer, you... nothing good for you.<eos> You don't know any more about my future than I do, Jason.<eos> What?<eos> Yes, I do.
McGee, where are you?<eos> Do you think it's possible we could've shaken these guys?<eos> No.<eos> Keep your eyes open.<eos> Oh, boss, I got a signal.<eos> These damn things won't let me shut 'em down.<eos> - It's even messing with our phones.<eos> - Got every available I.T. helping Ms. Sciuto, and not one of them knows what the hell it is.<eos> We know one I.T. who does.<eos> Or did.
I couldn't trust my own best friend.<eos> I'm sorry, Stewie.<eos> You're right.<eos> I let you down.<eos> I guess... I guess I was just too embarrassed to admit I had herpes.<eos> It was a rotten thing to do, and I promise I will never lie to you again.<eos> Thanks Brian.<eos> That's all I really wanted.<eos> So, do you forgive me?<eos> Yes. I do.
When are you going to arrest Charlie?<eos> He lied about what he saw at the ravine.<eos> Danny, stop with all this.<eos> They're letting you go.<eos> I'm not gonna stop, okay?<eos> Something has to be done here.<eos> Forensics found nothing at the ravine, nothing at the church.<eos> So even with your confession, you may just walk.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - Oh, yes, you do.
- (Sighs) You know there's a door downstairs.<eos> This isn't a door? (Chuckles)<eos> - I just wanted to see you.<eos> - Not my dad?<eos> No, just you.<eos> Charlie tried to talk to me today.<eos> He was trying to be... apologetic.<eos> Is it okay if we don't talk about him?<eos> I think at this point we both know who he is.<eos> Yeah. We do.
But then I find out that he didn't kill my mom, that Vikram killed her!<eos> And then what happens, you know?<eos> Danny and I, we... we... (Crying) we become close, and all he talks about inside is... is you, Lacey, and Green Grove.<eos> Everything that he was missing - was what I never had.<eos> - So you just decided to come here and take it from him.<eos> No, there's... no, I just wanted a fresh start.<eos> Like I told Danny, like I told everybody.<eos> That night in the woods, you saw... everything.<eos> Why didn't you tell us?<eos> I didn't...
Get in the car!<eos> Get down, get down!<eos> Buckle up!<eos> I told you to buckle up!<eos> Come on!<eos> They must've hit the thrusters!<eos> That'll be 20 bucks.<eos> I'm putting the plane down.<eos> We need to go after them.<eos> - No, we don't.
You're missing the point.<eos> I didn't want to just cross him off.<eos> I wanted to make a spectacle.<eos> People are killed by guns every day in Bogota.<eos> But how often does a monster punch a drug lord's head clean off?<eos> Hell, that's international news.<eos> Spectacular thing you did back there, Mikey.<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd swear you're starting to enjoy your job.<eos> You get the impression he's enjoying his job?<eos> Somebody does.
Don't do it, Ward!<eos> Okay, you don't have to do this!<eos> Ward!<eos> You don't have to!<eos> You have a choice!<eos> Ward!<eos> Ward, look at me!<eos> I know that you care about us, Ward!<eos> You're right.<eos> I do.
He's gonna enjoy it.<eos> He's made that very clear.<eos> And once Avery finds out, oh, that's it.<eos> He's never gonna forgive me...<eos> Ever.<eos> Not that I deserve to be forgiven, but...<eos> Well, now, come on, now.<eos> Everybody deserves to be forgiven.<eos> Not Jeff.<eos> Jeff doesn't.
She's not a good person, Scarlett!<eos> I thought she was, and she wasn't!<eos> That's it!<eos> It doesn't go any deeper than that!<eos> She is a good person!<eos> I'm sure she's done some things in her past she's not too proud of, but I've known you long enough.<eos> You would go back and do things different if you could.<eos> - You know what?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> - It does!
Yeah, we got our whole lives.<eos> I'll make pancakes.<eos> That was fabulous!<eos> Hey, just wanted to say congratulations. ♪ Now it's all wrong ♪ ♪ That's just a-how it goes when you're gone ♪<eos> You came back.<eos> I'm not back.<eos> See, my problem is...<eos> That I believe you.<eos> I believe you when you say you love me.<eos> I do.
Deacon.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> I just wanted to come over and say congratulations and what a great guy he is and that I hope you'll both be very happy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause it's a lie.<eos> I was angry when I thought you were lying to me, so I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> I got to say something.<eos> No, you don't.
I believe he worked in your unit.<eos> Sergeant Voight is very familiar with the rules and guidelines of the Chicago Police Department.<eos> And he was given a direct order from Street Deputy Horton to answer each and every question truthfully.<eos> At this time I'd like to state that Sergeant Voight is only answering these questions under duress.<eos> You got something you want to ask me?<eos> Ask it.<eos> The last person we know Sheldon Jin spoke to was you.<eos> There was an outgoing cell phone call from your personal cell to Jin's personal cell an hour before he was killed.<eos> Do you remember making that call?<eos> I do.
You got it, boss.<eos> What are we looking for here?<eos> Traps or something?<eos> Step aside before you hurt yourself.<eos> Hey, yeah, you know...<eos> A simple "I got this" would suffice, Kev.<eos> I got this.<eos> So what's on the drive?<eos> Did you know Jin was working with IA?<eos> I didn't.
Wait for the money to be handed over first,<eos> - then move in.<eos> - Then we move in quick.<eos> Okay?<eos> As you can tell,<eos> Bembenek and his brother have no problem getting violent.<eos> All right?<eos> Hey, Lindsay, Lindsay...<eos> I know how you're feeling.<eos> Al... You don't.
Oh, yeah.<eos> I-I'm a countertenor, and I practically have the score memorized.<eos> I was obsessed with my tape of Mary Martin's version when I was a kid.<eos> She was my childhood hero.<eos> Which explains a lot now that I think about it.<eos> We have a piano.<eos> Uh, could you audition with any music or anything?<eos> You know, we just can't hand you a part.<eos> We have standards. Right?<eos> I-I do.
I don't remember well, but Megumi was small... I had to stay strong and support my husband.<eos> I had no time for crying.<eos> But you know, tears would come down when I least expected it.<eos> Like I'd cry suddenly when I'm on a train looking out the window absently.<eos> Was it hard to take care of him?<eos> It was.<eos> He wanted to stay home instead of being at a hospital.<eos> So I was the one who was taking care of him.<eos> Did you ever want to run away because caring for him was too hard?<eos> Yes, I did.
Then I couldn't raise my left arm.<eos> And now I'm having difficulty moving my left leg.<eos> In the future... I won't be able to move the muscles on my right side.<eos> And I won't be able to move muscles on my face to laugh or speak.<eos> And I won't be able to breathe.<eos> It's a disease that takes away my freedom one by one.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> My child would never get such a disease.<eos> I thought so too.<eos> But I did.
This feels so strange... for you to bring your ex-boyfriend, Megumi.<eos> Megumi-san and I became close again.<eos> Megumi is a care worker.<eos> I'm sure she can help you in many ways.<eos> I want to be with Takuto as much as I can.<eos> I'm sorry for all the trouble I'm causing.<eos> Do you know what you are doing?<eos> I know.<eos> If you know, you wouldn't do this.<eos> I do.

I am not good at interacting with people.<eos> For example, I don't mean it but I may say things to make people mad.<eos> When that happens, I would appreciate if you could tell me that.<eos> There are many other problems too.<eos> I wrote them down.<eos> I hope you don't mind reading it.<eos> [Handling Instructions of Sawada Rikuto] Please.<eos> Do you promise to love her for all of your life... in health and in sickness, in happiness and in sadness?<eos> Yes, I do.

- So you did forget.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> You are late.<eos> I left a message on your phone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I actually saw Megu-chan and Shige-senpai the other day.<eos> As long as you are okay with it, they said Megu-chan could come here and help you.<eos> Yeah, she came here several times.<eos> Megu-chan did?
No, you don't understand.<eos> I'm giving this to you.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, I'm done with the song.<eos> So that's it.<eos> I'm giving this... To you. Ohh.<eos> Alice, right?<eos> Do you want to go to the zoo sometime?<eos> I heard they have a new manatee.<eos> They do.
Oh, no.<eos> The S.S. Desperation?<eos> That's what we used to call it.<eos> When you were younger and had all your options.<eos> Now you'd better call it your last best chance to find your perfect Southern fiancé.<eos> So, you want to put me out to sea for a month with a bunch of Titanic-worshipping losers?<eos> It is a luxury liner with a very exclusive passenger list, most of whom disembark engaged.<eos> It's Noah's Ark in reverse.<eos> You leave in four days.<eos> Uh, no, I don't.
If you recall, I returned with someone else.<eos> I was in a serious relationship!<eos> Yes, because you were doing everything in your power to deny your true feelings.<eos> You don't want to be in love with Wade because he hurt you, which is why you took off to New York the minute that he told you that he loved you.<eos> And then you had to watch him date your cousin... which proved that he had changed and he had grown up, and it killed you.<eos> Because... guess why.<eos> You...<eos> love him, Zoe.<eos> No... I... don't.<eos> - Yes, you do.

I... don't.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - I do not!
Oh, I don't know.<eos> I mean, you could acknowledge how I sad I loved you.<eos> And then how you just walked away?<eos> I guess...<eos> I guess I didn't know what to say.<eos> Or I did.<eos> Just I didn't want to say it there... at the Rammer Jammer.<eos> Zoe, you and I, we... we tried to make this work.<eos> We tried for a long time.<eos> And it just... it just didn't.
- Wait, what?<eos> Man, that's surprising.<eos> Crickett?<eos> I didn't see that one coming.<eos> A.B., are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Um, just...<eos> I have my answer.<eos> Y... you do?
- Oh God no.<eos> The boobs, the hair, the nose... all fake.<eos> The maintenance alone would break you.<eos> Wow.<eos> I didn't know you were so good at this.<eos> Oh, Ben, the things you don't know about me could fill an adult bookstore.<eos> I can't believe I'm gonna ask you this, but... will you be my wingmom?<eos> Wait.<eos> For the first time in history, a son actually wants his mother's opinion on who to go out with?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I was.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Keep up.<eos> But now he has moved on to some other bimbo.<eos> That wasn't just any bimbo!<eos> That's the bimbo I told him to go out with to make you jealous!<eos> Wait, why would he want to make her jealous?<eos> - Because he likes her!<eos> - He does?<eos> He does?
Can you believe "Tuckles" was already taken?<eos> Can I interest you in either a snake or a hot dog?<eos> Oh, in a minute.<eos> I got a little unfinished business.<eos> Really?<eos> You couldn't have told me you changed your mind before I got on the subway like this?<eos> I realized I had to do it for Emma.<eos> Do you know how long it takes to explain to a transit cop why you've got a rubber chicken in your pants?<eos> Actually...<eos> I do.
I got to get out of here.<eos> Riley, wait. What are you... come on!<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, ironically she just remembered that she left a cake in the oven.<eos> Aww, a girl after my own heart.<eos> You know, she reminds me of my little sister.<eos> Or your daughter?<eos> - I don't have one.<eos> - But what if you did?<eos> But I don't.

I don't think I really thought about how that divorce might affect Tucker.<eos> Mrs. Wheeler, I just don't...<eos> Hey, Tuck.<eos> I found your dad.<eos> He was in the closet.<eos> But not the same one my dad was in.<eos> Tucker!<eos> Tucker, stop!<eos> - You have to talk to me.<eos> - No, I don't.
Doesn't feel right talking about it with Steve around, we should be partying, kicking back a few!<eos> Are you a cottage kinda girl? Well, cottage, just like that, eh'?<eos> My cottage yeah, we could go for a day, or two, or three whenever I don't have my daughter and you uh...<eos> I dunno... ldunno...<eos> - Hey, you got Vivo Per Lei'?<eos> - Huh?<eos> Vivo Per Lei, the song.<eos> Andrea Bocelli, yup, I have it.<eos> You have the duet version, the guy and the girl?<eos> - I do.
What? ! As a favour to me.<eos> Since this whole fire incident has really brought us together.<eos> No, but, sir, I am on call for...<eos> Yes, yes, if there's a device, you must go, but otherwise, you're in charge of keeping this prize-winning chump out of harm's way.<eos> And out of my way.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Do that and I might overlook this gigantic flaming cock-up.<eos> Carry on.<eos> Do you want your kebab now, boss?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Let's put this guy back in his cell.<eos> - Goodbye doctor, we'll see you in court in five or six months.<eos> - Alright, alright, alright.<eos> I...<eos> I'll take you to the bodies.<eos> I know where the bodies are.<eos> - Are you saying something different now?<eos> - I am.<eos> - You know where the bodies are?<eos> - I do.
I'm afraid that's not exactly accurate, Harold.<eos> Collier just sent out another coded message.<eos> "Disseminate."<eos> A shocking revelation today as an anonymous source released a classified government report.<eos> The report revealed black budget items connected to an invasive surveillance system.<eos> High-level government officials, including Senator Ross Garrison, were named in the report.<eos> Senator!<eos> Senator!<eos> Does this massive surveillance system exist, Senator?<eos> It does not.
This guy again.<eos> He's like a cockroach.<eos> Sounds like our last escape route is about to disappear.<eos> I'm more comfortable shooting this guy than the cops.<eos> You guys going my way?<eos> Congressman was abducted by a white male, 6'3", dark hair, in suit.<eos> Be advised, suspect is armed and extremely dangerous.<eos> Nice car, Shaw.<eos> So how'd you know we'd be there?<eos> I didn't... Until five minutes ago.
- I hate to put my foot down...<eos> - Not a movie. But I actually talked to the real guy.<eos> I thought there was a Chris Mullin movie.<eos> So I think that that means that I have...<eos> - Dibs.<eos> Oh! - I was just gonna say dibs!<eos> - Dibs.<eos> - Oh, yeah!<eos> I have the only car that can pick it up.<eos> - You did!
Oh, you did it before I could do it!<eos> - You did it before I could do it!<eos> - Stop!<eos> What are... Don't push me!<eos> Now he's in there.<eos> Great. Not doing it.<eos> I'm not doing it.<eos> Blake, you don't even know how to drive, man.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Yes, I do.
Hurry, or we'll be dead before tomorrow.<eos> Observe, child, the quintessence of devoted marriage, how carefully I attend to my dear husband's toilet And how fearlessly he exposes his throat to my blade.<eos> Come along, miss Mercy.<eos> Leave her.<eos> Take him with you, tituba.<eos> One's too few, and three's too many.<eos> Your eyes... So filled with want.<eos> The hard part's not getting what you want, child.<eos> The hard part's knowing what you want.<eos> But I do.
"I in love with you all over again."<eos> "It's immense and immeasurable."<eos> Breakfast in bed for my queen.<eos> So much love?<eos> Is it a dream or reality?<eos> 50-50.<eos> Ready?<eos> I'm trying to turn this dream into reality.<eos> Do I have your permission?<eos> You do.
Yes.<eos> I'm Maria, his assistant.<eos> He's in surgery right now, but he should be out pretty soon.<eos> - You're...<eos> - Alicia Florrick.<eos> I just wanted to see if he was all right.<eos> Mrs. Florrick.<eos> He's much better now, thanks.<eos> How do you know Finn?<eos> I... don't, really.
Okay.<eos> I'll give you a few days<eos> - and then we'll talk.<eos> - No, you're fired, Mr. Klepper.<eos> You don't belong here anymore as a client.<eos> We'll transfer your files to your home.<eos> This is insane.<eos> Do you know how much business<eos> - I bring in here?<eos> - I do.
The Chalice has traveled across continents, been touched by kings and emperors.<eos> It's a nice cup.<eos> "Nice cup"? Yeah.<eos> It's not the Stanley Cup, but it's a nice cup.<eos> It's a nice thing.<eos> Booth, I don't think you appreciate what an extraordinary find this is.<eos> Look, I get it. It just doesn't do it for me.<eos> Well, what do you mean?<eos> What doesn't it do?<eos> It just doesn't do it for me.
And she waits...<eos> And waits...<eos> And she waits, but he never comes, and so she's standing there, on the bridge, alone, wondering how he could just leave her there, after she said she loves him so much?<eos> I admire your passion, Ms. Mclnerney, but our job is to simply revive a dead letter and send it along.<eos> And, yes, there are times when we wonder what will become of those who receive them, but we are the United States post office.<eos> We cannot play God.<eos> You said you don't believe in coincidences.<eos> What if you had pulled a green envelope out of there, instead of that pink one?<eos> Then Charlie and Kelly would never have had a chance.<eos> But now they do.
I didn't want to tell you because I knew...<eos> I knew this would happen.<eos> I knew it would push you away.<eos> I love you.<eos> Mindy, I love you.<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Yes, you do.
Deep cover measures.<eos> Need to know.<eos> Jones's work on the PX servers overlapped with a CIA money laundering operation.<eos> You ever heard of bitcoins?<eos> Never mind, it's confusing.<eos> Jones has and he agreed to help.<eos> I understand-- the CIA has left a bad taste in your mouth.<eos> Trent Kort-flavored, right?<eos> How do you know Trent Kort?<eos> Don't.
Nice.<eos> I... I thought I'd make a start with decorations.<eos> Try and cheer myself up.<eos> Doesn't seem to be really doing the trick...<eos> Look, I know it must be really hard right now, but maybe in the long run it'll be for the best, you know?<eos> You were making each other really unhappy.<eos> Darling, I know you're trying to be helpful, but you can't possibly understand how this feels.<eos> Actually, I sort of can.<eos> You don't know what it's like to be with somebody you actually care about.<eos> Yes, I do.
We do not, okay?<eos> Okay, try not to miss us too much.<eos> Okay, we'll try.<eos> You realize you're kidding yourself, right?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You said you were not into Eddie.<eos> She's like my sister.<eos> Well, I think you want to kiss your sister.<eos> And I don't mean Erin.<eos> I don't.
- Nothing!<eos> Look, Leon's best friend died.<eos> I was being supportive, and it turned into something else, but it was a mistake, and it never happened again.<eos> Chelsea, this undermines your credibility.<eos> And it gives the Breakers the right to terminate you.<eos> Well, it doesn't give Ally and her posse<eos> - the right to harass me.<eos> - No.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> It doesn't.
She sounds like a character from "The Sopranos."<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You're right.<eos> She's exactly like a character from "The Sopranos."<eos> The Breaker girls... they're not monsters.<eos> They're mobsters.<eos> I'm gonna take on the mob.<eos> Your Honor, I'm amending my cause of action to include a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.<eos> You want to treat the Breaker girls as a criminal enterprise under RICO?<eos> - I do.
Well, remember when I considered using an anonymous donor?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - My first choice was unavailable because he had already fathered 20 children... the legal limit.<eos> So, what if Laura's father is popular?<eos> Yeah, she could have up to 19 half siblings out there, but the fertility clinic won't share that information.<eos> Sweetie, there's an online registry that matches children with their biological fathers<eos> - using the donor's ID Number. - What?<eos> Yeah, it was started by kids who wanted to meet their genetic siblings but didn't know their father's name.<eos> Do you happen to know Laura's dad's donor ID?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
That's true.<eos> I mean, no reason to hold back.<eos> Okay, I have one thing to confess.<eos> I kind of told Jane.<eos> I thought we agreed to keep it quiet.<eos> Well, she's my best friend.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you mad?<eos> I told Paul.<eos> You did?
Cheryl just said that you both know you didn't do it, and given that she's obsessed with you and hated her husband, I don't think you killed Harry.<eos> I think it's possible she did.<eos> And according to that file, she was at the club the day of the murder.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> We have another suspect.<eos> Stace?<eos> Sweetie, what's wrong?<eos> I'm worried about Owen.<eos> I don't think he wants to marry me.<eos> Well, of course he does.
I still can't go to Disney Land.<eos> Thank you for sharing. Mm-hmm.<eos> But we've been here for 45 minutes, and I'm not hearing anything from Owen.<eos> Owen, you recently had an anxiety attack.<eos> Let's talk about that.<eos> Yes, let's!<eos> I don't think Owen wants to marry me.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> No, of course I do.
Witness will answer the question.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Young lady, my offer to sentence you for contempt is still on the table.<eos> Fine.<eos> Maybe I did attend that performance.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> I can't remember everything I do.<eos> And then you publicly attended the March performance as a smokescreen, knowing that you had already copyrighted those dance moves prior to that date.<eos> If you say so.<eos> Oh, I do.
W-what is this?<eos> Listen...<eos> I want a wedding with flowers and a harpist and white doves released as we say our vows.<eos> I will stay handcuffed to you if that's what it takes to convince you that I'm not going anywhere.<eos> No, no.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> It's your wedding, too, and I want it to be perfect, and it won't be if you're feeling anxious.<eos> You're amazing, you know that?<eos> - I do, actually.<eos> - I really do.
I'll look into Megan's father, and I'll do everything I can to suppress your confession.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'll be in touch.<eos> Heard about your case.<eos> If you're gonna yell at me for taking another pro-bono,<eos> - don't stress your vocal cords. I'm fully committed.<eos> - I like it.<eos> Parents fighting for their kid?<eos> I get it.<eos> - And I did some digging into Harper School's financial records.
The state gave Harper School, LLC the money and not Harper School Inc., which is a separate legal entity.<eos> It's a difference without a distinction.<eos> Hardly.<eos> The state approached the school about using our athletic fields for public youth programs.<eos> We accepted the money through a separate business entity precisely to avoid the public funding that might jeopardize our private status.<eos> Taxpayer money still made it onto Harper School's campus.<eos> I'm sorry, Ms. Bingum, but Mr. Brenner is correct.<eos> These are different corporate entities, so AB1266 doesn't apply.<eos> Unless you have something else...<eos> Absolutely. I do, your honor.
Oh, come on, it's good.<eos> Come on.<eos> No, it's yours.<eos> No.<eos> What do you want, Simon?<eos> We are blowing out Madison's candles.<eos> No.<eos> Listen, I don't care that you're her father.<eos> Madison doesn't want to talk to you.<eos> Because she doesn't.
I love you.<eos> Alpha Oscar Three Charlie Zulu, come in.<eos> Alpha Oscar Three Charlie Zulu, come in?<eos> Unknown caller, by failing to identify yourself, you are conducting an illegal radio transmission.<eos> Oz Turner?<eos> I-I-9-9-R-C.<eos> There is no caller by that handle at this location.<eos> Over.<eos> Mr. Turner, we need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
Hot in Cleveland is recorded in front of a live studio audience.<eos> Special Agent Griffin Gilmore, administering polygraph examination.<eos> Case number 2498, escape from Ohio federal corrections facility, prisoner:<eos> Emmet Lawson.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Emmet is a Sir.<eos> He was knighted by the queen, you know, like Sir Elton John and Sir Paul McCartney.<eos> I mean, maybe the queen is just a big fame whore and this is her way of meeting celebrities, but it should count for something.<eos> It doesn't.
Oh, thank God.<eos> You know, on Edge of Tomorrow,<eos> Honor St. Raven once cloned a missing lover from the DNA left in his shoe.<eos> Let's call that "Plan B."<eos> Yeah, I don't even know if my shoes will fit me anymore.<eos> My feet swell up two sizes when I'm pregnant.<eos> Pregnant.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Well, Melanie, when a man and a woman love each other very much, and the woman is pushing 50... how did this happen?<eos> It just did.
- We should go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Uh, just give me a minute.<eos> Um, we'll be outside.<eos> Look, I wanted to stand by your side during your pregnancy.<eos> And I'll stand by your side for whatever this is.<eos> That's sweet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I have a really good support team.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Yeah.<eos> Uh, just give me a minute.<eos> Um, we'll be outside.<eos> Look, I wanted to stand by your side during your pregnancy.<eos> And I'll stand by your side for whatever this is.<eos> That's sweet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I have a really good support team.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Yeah, she does.
And we can ask a lot of handsome men from the theater world.<eos> Yeah, and a few straight ones just to mix things up.<eos> Well, the only straight one I know in the theater is Kevin Kline.<eos> And every time I see him, it reminds me that I didn't get Sophie's Choice.<eos> Damn you, Meryl Streep!<eos> Damn you and all your oscars!<eos> Oh, don't listen to my language, Tony.<eos> Mommy's just upset.<eos> But Meryl Streep doesn't have a Tony, does she?<eos> No, she doesn't, no, she doesn't.
I'm sorry.<eos> Well, look, look, obviously, you know,<eos> I can't... condone this kind of behavior.<eos> But, you know, if you...<eos> if you think it's... helping you, I mean, that's really the important thing.<eos> It is helping.<eos> I feel so free.<eos> Do you know what it's like to have sex with a woman who never wants to see you again?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm not even here.<eos> You're the best.<eos> You know what?<eos> Not a lot of guys would do this.<eos> No one is gonna cut you up into little pieces tonight.<eos> What?<eos> I'm gonna keep you safe.<eos> Go, don't think about it.<eos> Hey, you like eggs Benedict?<eos> I do.
Sort of my...<eos> My only friend, and, uh...<eos> I need to have you in my life.<eos> I have to have you, and this...<eos> I'm afraid that this is...<eos> This is gonna...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No, no, no, don't, don't.<eos> Wait a minute... you don't know what I'm about to tell you.<eos> I do.
My only friend, and, uh...<eos> I need to have you in my life.<eos> I have to have you, and this...<eos> I'm afraid that this is...<eos> This is gonna...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No, no, no, don't, don't.<eos> Wait a minute... you don't know what I'm about to tell you.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.

I met this one.<eos> I mean... yeah.<eos> Yeah, I mean we bumped into each other this morning at the queue to the lift.<eos> And I guess we were both longing for someone...<eos> Just kidding.<eos> No, we had a great day.<eos> Good snowboarding and really nice talks.<eos> You told me that you're very religious.<eos> - I... didn't say that.<eos> - Yes, you did.
No! I did not.<eos> - No, no...<eos> - Come on.<eos> No, no, no...<eos> You ran away from the table.<eos> What?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> Oh, okay. No.<eos> I did not.
You didn't tell me.<eos> Then could you please share your experience with us?<eos> But it's...<eos> It's not really relevant how I perceived it.<eos> Though it's obvious that the experience was very dramatic to you.<eos> So you're not on board with the version Ebba just told us?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> I don't share that interpretation of the events.<eos> I don't.
Mats...<eos> - Could you carry Vera?<eos> - Are you tired?<eos> Want a smoke?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Actually, can I take one?<eos> - Yes, of course.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Do you smoke, Daddy?<eos> Yes, I do.
No, they don't care about me.<eos> That came out way more pathetic than it was supposed to.<eos> But, uh, it's fine I'm here.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Yes?<eos> Hi, it's Norma Bates.<eos> I need to see Nick Ford.<eos> Hello, Mrs. Bates.<eos> I don't show that Mr. Ford has an appointment with you.<eos> Well, he doesn't.
The mayor is ready for you, Mrs. Bates.<eos> I understand that coastal development is necessary, but it really needs to be seriously controlled, in order to maintain a kind of quality of life that I think we're all used to living here in Pine White Bay... Or White Pine Bay.<eos> So how do you know the Heldens?<eos> Oh, Christine and I met at community theater.<eos> Ah. I love them both.<eos> They're really great friends of mine, and they love you.<eos> That's nice to hear. Yeah.<eos> They're great.<eos> And you also know Nick Ford.<eos> Yes, I do.
Miles are meaningless.<eos> They're obviously not meaningless.<eos> - Yes, they are.<eos> - Why do you keep saying that?<eos> OK, then.<eos> Just wait. Oh...<eos> Can you pull my wallet from the front?<eos> - I got it, I got it.<eos> I did, I did, I did. - You got it?<eos> I did. Yeah.
Right. The stoning.<eos> Fuck.<eos> The victim was what, Tomorrow's Family?<eos> No, Guilty Remnant.<eos> Oh, those nuts.<eos> What's up with the chain-smoking?<eos> Look, you know what?<eos> It sounds like you got your hands full.<eos> They sent the body to you a couple hours ago, and it's not like...<eos> Shit. They did?
I don't know, my...<eos> I learned how to drink from my father, I learned how to curse from my mother and I learned how to make love from my uncle.<eos> And I'm a Scorpio.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I mean, your sign.<eos> Not that other horrible stuff.<eos> - You are so cute. - (giggles)<eos> You single?<eos> Why, do you know someone?<eos> - Yes, I do. - MOLLY:
How you doing?"<eos> - Are those your American impressions?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Those are really good.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I mean, what's wrong with asking people how they're doing?<eos> Well, it's fake.<eos> In Sweden we just do that if we really want to know the answer, you know?<eos> - But I do want to know the answer.<eos> - No, you don't.
Holy crap!<eos> I heard you talking-- congratulations.<eos> Also, what time y'all want us back?<eos> At your house?<eos> To finish plumbing?<eos> - I think we're good for now.<eos> - We don't.<eos> N-No, no, no!<eos> BlueBell loves town events.<eos> Yes, we do.
And I probably didn't hear you 'cause I had headphones on.<eos> I like to listen to '90s RB when I'm prepping for a trial.<eos> Come on, guys. Show a little faith.<eos> Show a little faith.<eos> Show a little...<eos> That's what I said.<eos> That's what I told her.<eos> Liar!<eos> Liar.<eos> I did!
Hasn't budged for hours.<eos> Not even to go to the bathroom.<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> Oh, can I sit in?<eos> I won't say a word.<eos> Um, you know, it might be more comfortable for her if it's just one on one.<eos> Let me show you to the interview room.<eos> She's enthusiastic.<eos> But she means well.<eos> They all do.
- I don't care about that!<eos> Give me his notes.<eos> Quickly!<eos> "Michael Jackson, from Gotham City..."<eos> Did you not find this strange, when you filled this in?<eos> I didn't fill it in.<eos> You didn't...<eos> What about Prometheus?<eos> Working together again?<eos> We never did.
I don't want you to hear it until it's finished.<eos> This is a recording studio.<eos> I hear unfinished songs all the time.<eos> Well, not this one.<eos> Not till it's ready.<eos> Ready for what?<eos> For you.<eos> Well, I can't wait to hear it.<eos> Nobody ever believed in me like you.<eos> I do, Billy.
Really?<eos> - How's that?<eos> - Well, you know, backstabbing, stealing secrets, pretending to be someone's friend just so you can undermine them.<eos> - We've all been there.<eos> - Is that so?<eos> And what kind of a pageant have you been in?<eos> Well, it was a robotics competition.<eos> Ahem. But the, politics are all the same.<eos> - If you say so.<eos> - I do.
No!<eos> This is my life!<eos> My life!<eos> I'm getting married, and you can't stop me!<eos> Thank you for bringing her home.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> It might not be my place...<eos> Ms. McInerney, do you have children?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
You're trying to save her.<eos> You've seen danger here.<eos> My old friend, how can I say this?<eos> I can't let you leave.<eos> Your gift of sight is invaluable to me, to the safety of France.<eos> You can force me to stay... but not to see.<eos> You'll have me, but not my visions.<eos> Not if you cost me this last chance at happiness.<eos> So you came to me as if I had a choice,<eos> - but clearly I don't.
Know him well?<eos> A bit.<eos> He grew up here, But he's a lot younger than me.<eos> [clears throat] That's where you're supposed to say,<eos> "but he doesn't look it, miller."<eos> Ah, missed my cue.<eos> Mm-hmm. Anyway, he left right after high school.<eos> He's been back two, three years.<eos> [knocks on door] Tom goes to his Sunday school.<eos> So did danny.
You lie to me... con me... like I'm...<eos> I'm some... some chump 'cause you want to get Truman's little bitch on your team?<eos> Well, we got a spy in Truman's house now.<eos> And if she convinces other people in town, we got an underground.<eos> Who cares?<eos> We could've used the gas.<eos> We could've taken out a truckload of Patriots.<eos> And anybody else who gets caught in the middle.<eos> You said you wanted to win!<eos> I do.
We're still friends. What kind of God would put a chocolate fountain on a train and not let kids near it? !<eos> Yeah!<eos> Learn how to build a train, God!<eos> Well... the chocolate fountain is impressive, but the real supply's all the way up front.<eos> What do you mean, "The real supply?"<eos> There's way more chocolate up in the kitchen.<eos> I've seen them load boxes and boxes of it in there.<eos> Well, then, are you guys thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> That I need a bath?<eos> Oh, yeah. You do.
Now they've taken our guns, we're at their mercy.<eos> You mean the mercy of the rebels like the one they've got locked up down below.<eos> Figures that it's a Brewster.<eos> I'm married to a Brewster.<eos> Moses?<eos> Moses, do you still have it?<eos> - What?<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> The petition.<eos> You do, don't you?
We have to stop him.<eos> To the stable.<eos> Peggy-Sis.<eos> Headhorn.<eos> Chariot.<eos> And Minnie.<eos> The Equestranauts!<eos> Do I like this show?<eos> Neigh...<eos> I do not.
Are you named Bob?<eos> Oh. I was just...<eos> Bob, come.<eos> Sorry, Sunpuddle.<eos> Oh, he's always doing that to me.<eos> All these...<eos> Equesticles.<eos> We both know they're weak, pathetic.<eos> I-I don't think that.<eos> Yes, you do.
Always loving Valor, Adriana loathed her tower.<eos> Always loving Valor, Adriana loathed her tower. Ha! Ha ha ha ha!<eos> Dreams really do come true.<eos> And happily ever after?<eos> I think happily ever after starts right... about... now?<eos> Oh, it gets me every time.<eos> You pass.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why didn't you just tell me you knew what you were doing before?<eos> I didn't.
Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> Oh, Mandy and I have no secrets.<eos> Ah, well, considering your year as a carny, that's disturbing.<eos> April, um...<eos> Look, Mike and I have always been willing to help you, but this... this donor-egg project...<eos> We just don't feel comfortable underwriting it.<eos> I'm sorry, honey.<eos> If we don't help her, how is she gonna start a family, Mom?<eos> Yeah, I don't have anywhere else to turn.<eos> Yes, you do.
Jack.<eos> - Hello.<eos> I'm Dr. Maura Isles.<eos> I'm teaching a seminar in forensic science.<eos> First time?<eos> I wasn't sure if there was any, um, audiovisual, uh, system, so I just brought everything.<eos> All you need is a password for the wireless system.<eos> - Oh. - Do you have a laptop?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> I do.
Yep!<eos> You bet... for two whole minutes.<eos> Then, um... in retrospect, a laser show and 3-D holograms was one gigawatt too many.<eos> I just started my lecture on mechanical engineering, and the whole building blacked out.<eos> Oh, you're... you're a teacher here.<eos> Yeah. You thought I was the A.V. guy?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, I totally did.
- Thank you.<eos> Please, have a seat.<eos> - I think it's best to be up front.<eos> - Damn.<eos> I... haven't finished yet.<eos> You were gonna say you're not that into me.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - I really thought we had chemistry.<eos> It seemed like you thought so, too.<eos> We do.
I'm sure Agent Booth merely meant that since Stephanie McNamara was...<eos> I know what Agent Booth meant.<eos> And I appreciate his honesty.<eos> That's why you're on our short list for the...<eos> I'm not in it for a promotion, sir, I just want to catch the murderer.<eos> Of course.<eos> And you're right about the McNamaras.<eos> They were a very powerful family.<eos> Wealth has its privileges.<eos> Yes, it does, Ms. Julian.
What happened?<eos> It's not important.<eos> I will let you leave if you tell me.<eos> It's just the stupid cupcakes.<eos> For you those are just stupid cupcakes.<eos> You know, not everyone are born like you.<eos> You have everything.<eos> That's why sometimes you don't put value... in simple things that are priceless to others.<eos> I know what you mean.<eos> Do you?
No.<eos> This is decent.<eos> He asked me permission.<eos> I gave him one. O?<eos> Come on.<eos> What do you want to happen?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Let's just eat.<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> I do like.
You can use me as your tissue right now.<eos> Feel free to blow your nose or wipe your tears on me.<eos> I don't care if you throw me the trash when you're done.<eos> As long as I'm useful to you, Lory.<eos> Just let me wipe your tears.<eos> I saw Cross and Eya kiss.<eos> Chad, they're a couple.<eos> That hurts.<eos> Lory, trust me when I tell you, I know how it feels.<eos> I really do.
Max, I know I can make all of this money back<eos> If I just win one more race.<eos> I just need a sure thing.<eos> There is no such thing as a sure thing,<eos> Except my mother never picking me up from school.<eos> Look, there are two horses tomorrow that look really good,<eos> Buck That and Little House on the Gary.<eos> Little House on the Gary. That's my friend Eddie's horse.<eos> We don't have time to pretend you have a friend named Eddie right now.<eos> I do.
I'll come to you there when I finish my work.<eos> Come on, keep it going.<eos> Come on, let's get it done!<eos> Come on, put your back into it, girl.<eos> My hands are raw, sir.<eos> Carry on.<eos> Keep digging.<eos> If I had killed Hardwick today your lives would be worse not better.<eos> Kill one Hardwick and another will take his place. Do you understand?<eos> I do.
I don't know. I mean, you talk to god, right?<eos> He talks to whatever he calls it, His spirit guide.<eos> Isn't that sort of the same thing?<eos> Who decides that his messages Are any different from yours?<eos> Of course, if you ask your husband, Both of us are deranged.<eos> Ha.<eos> I can't even imagine.<eos> Look, you're so vulnerable now.<eos> Anyone who seems to have answers--<eos> Yeah, but no one does.
We have to work this out... Together.<eos> I'll see you at 8:00.<eos> That was a long run. Where were you? My mom just called me.<eos> What's this picture they're showing around?<eos> Why haven't we seen it? Well, we have seen it.<eos> No, I've seen it.<eos> It's right there.<eos> Right where?<eos> Did ellie bring it?<eos> No, pete did.
We'll start back at sunup.<eos> Talked to Rick.<eos> Some of them know what you did at the prison.<eos> Daryl, Maggie.<eos> They accept it.<eos> You wouldn't be here if they didn't.<eos> Gonna talk to the rest of them.<eos> Tell them to accept it, too.<eos> They don't have to.<eos> No, they do.
Hey, everyone, just a quick F.Y.I.<eos> (Chuckles)<eos> I'm blind as a bat.<eos> (Groans)<eos> (Crashes)<eos> Does Hulk smell angrier than usual?<eos> (Roars) (Grunts)<eos> (Crashes)<eos> Do I want to know what this looks like?<eos> You don't.
Well, it's not exactly a shocker.<eos> Frankly, I thought you'd been tipping the help since day one.<eos> Wait wait wait. You thought Joe and I were already a thing?<eos> Why else would you hire this fine-looking yet totally unqualified young buck to look after my grandchildren?<eos> Thank you, Russell.<eos> That was like 60% compliment.<eos> Well, I don't care what you think about my relationship, because I am a fully-grown, 31-to-35-year-old woman.<eos> Who looks 28.<eos> All kidding aside, Mel, I think you got yourself a good man.<eos> You do?

Mel doesn't want me involved at all.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> I know, right?<eos> School kids should have to memorize that.<eos> I meant how self-involved you are.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Mel's announcing her candidacy tomorrow.<eos> And for once in your life, you need to put aside your ego and just be there for her the way she needs you to be.<eos> You owe her that much.<eos> We all do.
Hi.<eos> I brought you some dog food.<eos> Look.<eos> Boy, hi, hi.<eos> Where's Emma?<eos> Where's Emma, huh?<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> Why'd you tell me you didn't have a family?<eos> I don't.<eos> You do.
Whatever you say.<eos> - Guards?<eos> - Probably.<eos> I'm going to check in with the bosses, let them know we're here.<eos> We'll keep an eye on them.<eos> Good luck with that, they disappear in and out of that camp like Houdini.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> That they might be involved?<eos> That Tommy lived here.<eos> - He did?
We'll go with you, but stay out of it when you need us to.<eos> Tommy...<eos> Can I talk to you?<eos> - I'll wait in the car. - No.<eos> Stay.<eos> What do you want?<eos> They arrested Colin.<eos> I know.<eos> - You have to help him.<eos> - No, I don't.
Well, you did right by Oscar.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Listen... near-death experiences make me hungry.<eos> You want to grab something?<eos> I'm buying.<eos> The least I could do.<eos> Not like... not like a date.<eos> Unless you want it to be.<eos> - If not...<eos> - I do.
There was a calling pattern on Rebecca Barton's phone.<eos> Same number kept cropping up.<eos> Untraceable.<eos> Check out the dates.<eos> I took it back a year.<eos> This was when we were looking for a mole in the department.<eos> And, more recently, when Liber8 took Jim Martin. Yeah.<eos> Betty found his location pretty quickly.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes you do.
I mean, what drives a mother to give up her son?<eos> Maybe she was a secret agent.<eos> Secret government agent. Ooh!<eos> Or a trained assassin.<eos> Huh? Or jail.<eos> (gasps) Foreign jail.<eos> She's probably sitting in some hellhole for stealing nuclear secrets and she had to give up the baby boy to keep him safe from retribution! (sighs): Ah...!<eos> That seems to fit.<eos> It does.<eos> It really does.
I want tell her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, fine.<eos> Just tell her soon, will you?<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> I was held up.<eos> Did you know there was a PDS brothel in Roarton?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
I'm considering doing something symbolically meaningful here.<eos> You too, Will.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Food's gonna get cold.<eos> - Okay, I got to go.<eos> - Ugh. Wuss. - Boys, huh?<eos> Yeah, this could take a while.<eos> I made guacamole, and I ate most of it while I was making the rest of dinner.<eos> You wouldn't happen to have any extra avocados, would you?<eos> I do.
What is this?<eos> Go home.<eos> - You're here.<eos> - I'm different.<eos> - Different?<eos> - Go home now. Let go!<eos> When I tell you something, you obey.<eos> Who are these girls?<eos> - You care?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- No, Mike. You know what?<eos> We've had our say.<eos> And as usual, you have had both of our says.<eos> Now it's time to let them go watch a tube sock contemplate suicide.<eos> All right.<eos> You have my word.<eos> No more riding bikes without training wheels.<eos> Well, does that look like fun?<eos> Do you want to do that?<eos> I sure do, Mr. B.
And you know what?<eos> I'm not down with that anymore.<eos> I've waited long enough, Kris.<eos> I want us to be an actual family.<eos> Mommy, I know I'm clumsy, but I want to ride the sheep.<eos> You are not clumsy, buddy.<eos> You did really great today.<eos> I am sure you did, okay?<eos> And I... I want to say yes.<eos> I do.
I'm trying to find my wife.<eos> One of you guys picked her up the night before last.<eos> She lost her phone.<eos> His name was "George Something."<eos> Can't talk.<eos> You're the last person to see her.<eos> She got out of my cab.<eos> 20 people do it a day.
I know... Who you are.<eos> I know what to say to make you laugh.<eos> I know how you felt when your mother died.<eos> I know how you felt when... Our baby died.<eos> I can'.<eos> I can't.<eos> I thought I knew you, but now...<eos> Baby, I...<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> You did.

Dr Turner telephoned from Astor Lodge.<eos> He says until the matron is officially replaced, we must have a qualified midwife in place round the clock.<eos> ~ Oh, he does, does he?<eos> ~ I'm sending Nurse Mount.<eos> And Nurse Noakes has agreed to commute there by bus each day, ~ until we get proper care organised for the mothers and the babies. ~ Ohh.<eos> There's nothing wrong with my knees!<eos> It's my lumbago.<eos> And if it's not that, it's my indigestion.<eos> ~ Sister, do you need a doctor?<eos> ~ No, I do not.
Bummer.<eos> Williamson: In one of his more antihero moments,<eos> Ryan pulls a Joe Carroll and takes out a follower in cold blood.<eos> Bacon: I loved the opportunity to look up and see that guy who put my dear partner in a box and shoot him in the head.<eos> Heh, heh.<eos> You know, as an actor, it was a really satisfying thing to do.<eos> Also in the coffin along with Deborah Parker was Joe Carroll's completed manuscript.<eos> Ryan pulls it out and reads that Joe Carroll's final plan is to play out the chapter of his book.<eos> How would he know exactly what as gonna happen?<eos> He doesn't.
Uh, there's nothing in there.<eos> But you don't know that-- it's locked.<eos> How do you know that combination?<eos> I think this was my locker... in 1988.<eos> What?<eos> Okay, i-is this some kind of joke?<eos> Played on us by the universe.<eos> Looks like her, huh?<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> And the dome does?
Just slow things down.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're the one who said that we can't do things halfway.<eos> All I can see out there is Colleen.<eos> What happened to your sister was totally different.<eos> She was kidnapped and used as leverage to force my father to do something against his will.<eos> She was terrorized, tortured, and killed.<eos> That is not gonna happen to Charlotte.<eos> You know that.<eos> She doesn't.
A psychopath.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Right, well, there you go.<eos> He's trashing his bedroom, wrecking our house.<eos> My house.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm trashing my bedroom!<eos> You're not trashing your bedroom!<eos> I hate her!<eos> No, you don't.
It could've been Demetrius.<eos> You'll have to excuse Detective Johnson.<eos> He's worried that you're confusing your duty as a defense attorney with your duties as a witness.<eos> You're not. Are you?<eos> Good luck, Mr. State's Attorney.<eos> Finn Polmar.<eos> Finn, I had a thought.<eos> About how to keep Castro from firing you.<eos> You know he's running for state's attorney?<eos> Yeah, I do. Why?
Mr. Governor, I... I hate to toot my own horn.<eos> Oh, toot away.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Since I took over the department, our conviction rate has gone up. I think that speaks to our increased scrutiny over prosecutions.<eos> Like Jeffrey Grant?<eos> Jeffrey Grant was a tragedy.<eos> We had an ASA who was looking to make his bones.<eos> He overreached.<eos> - You want my endorsement?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Give me 325 milligrams of aspirin and grab the pacer pads.<eos> - We need a formal E.K.G. now.<eos> - She already had one.<eos> Well, who ordered it?<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Is this your patient?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> She had the stomach flu.<eos> And did you order an E.K.G. on her?<eos> I... I did as part of a G.I. work-up.
Thanks.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jordan. Jordan!<eos> Push 150 milligrams amiodarone.<eos> Aggies over U.T.?<eos> What are you, crazy?<eos> What else you got, Javy?<eos> Hey, Charlie, if you could snap your fingers and be anywhere, where would you be, buddy?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, you do, man.
No.<eos> It's about how it feels to be a female ruler, trapped and alone.<eos> If anyone knows how terrifying that is, it is you.<eos> And I'd help if I could.<eos> But all of the court's money is tied up in the war with Calais.<eos> I'm not talking about the court's money.<eos> I'm talking about your money.<eos> The funds you keep hidden.<eos> Just in case you have to leave France in a hurry.<eos> - I don't...
I'm sorry, I don't.<eos> Pua...<eos> Kai.<eos> Pro Bowl weekend last year.<eos> I helped you crack a monster case.<eos> Oh, yeah, right!<eos> Now I remember!<eos> I figured you would.<eos> Uh, you may also remember, we kind of had a moment.<eos> Yeah... we did, didn't we?
What business did you say you were in?<eos> I didn't, Reverend.
And the plants.<eos> And the group discount, if that's what we're still offering.<eos> They won't win, love.<eos> These people.<eos> All in the palm of his hand.<eos> The palm of whose hand?<eos> Webb's.<eos> He said he was impartial, George.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Yes, I do.
Have you had any tea yet?<eos> MURMURS: An a fortiori argument is an argument from a stronger...<eos> Must you read at the table?<eos> What's all that stuff anyway?<eos> - I thought you were going to see Neville Kelly.<eos> - Well, we did.<eos> He's a charlatan.<eos> I can do better myself.<eos> Albert, I thought you'd picked up your pension this week?<eos> I did!
I was worried about you.<eos> I tried telephoning, but it looks like you've been busy.<eos> How did you get on, son? Shh!<eos> She's sleeping.<eos> WHISPERING: Let's go and have a look.<eos> I got the job.<eos> Aw, that's good news.<eos> You're hopeless without it.<eos> I'm sorry for what I said, I didn't mean...<eos> Yes, you did.
But, Richard?<eos> Um...<eos> Consider that maybe this might not be the best choice for the meeting?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Holy...<eos> What the fuck am I doing?<eos> I can't go like this to the meeting.<eos> Jared.<eos> I have no vision.<eos> Yes, you do.
All right, that might be enough weight.<eos> All right. Ready for that X-ray?<eos> - Right away.<eos> - Whoops! Looks like I need more irrigation.<eos> Uh, Wilson, can you take over?<eos> Yes, absolutely, Dr. Kepner.<eos> "Absolutely Dr. Kepner."<eos> Who are you?<eos> I thought you had grit.<eos> I do!
Well, all we have to do is call the Clairemont Hotel, ask them to check their records for a birthday party that was canceled for a Michael W-H- something in May of 2004.<eos> Who's the father?<eos> You amaze me.<eos> An hour ago, you didn't know these people existed.<eos> Now you can't continue until you determine the parentage of their child.<eos> I can't explain it, Oliver.<eos> I just... have got an instinct.<eos> An instinct.<eos> You once said, "we don't find the letters, they find us."<eos> I do.
I understand.<eos> Uh, thank you. Richard, I just wanna say, I really respect what you're doing here.<eos> And if you could ever use someone with my business development skill set, I would love to be a part of this.<eos> The fuck you will be.<eos> We'll call you when we want pleated khakis.<eos> You know this is a fucking domestic? Why... why were you so mean to him?<eos> He wasn't spying on us.<eos> He just said he likes us.<eos> - He wants to join the company.<eos> - Of course he does, Richard.
Anything needed to be said to her can be said to me.<eos> Oh, that's beautiful!<eos> My familiar.<eos> Familiar?<eos> A gift from the Devil to do my bidding, my spiritual companion.<eos> This is how she feeds.<eos> Will I get a familiar?<eos> In time.<eos> How do I choose?<eos> You don't.
Whose is it?<eos> Amy, did you bring this back from France?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Uh...<eos> I...<eos> I, um... we...<eos> Well, Lou, that is uh...<eos> Come on, Jack, your wife is chomping at the bit.<eos> - Did you just say "wife"?<eos> - Mm-hmm. He sure did.
Nothing you don't know.<eos> So what are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's kind of up to them.<eos> If you're not going to work,<eos> because I wanted to be here to fix it.<eos> How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you still love Megan?<eos> Of course I do.
Ryder, why could you possibly be speaking to me for the first time ever?<eos> That's a good one.<eos> Hey, listen, um...<eos> I have a little bit of a serious problem.<eos> I need to get a "B" on my next trig test.<eos> Or my aunt won't let me go to the senior trip to Washington D.C.<eos> Oh, that's too bad. The D.C. trip is reputed to be the highlight of senior year.<eos> Students running wild, skinny dipping in the pool, jumping on hotel beds...<eos> If that kind of thing appeals to you.<eos> Oh, it does.
Wow, that is so offensive.<eos> And totally brilliant, thanks.<eos> Oh yeah, and there's one other thing you should know, Honey, I can't hear you. Okay, you know what, just...<eos> I'll talk to you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, we need to talk.<eos> Oh, I can't right now, Joe.<eos> I just stopped by to pick up my notes for my afternoon meeting with the Mayor.<eos> I know what's going on.<eos> You do?
Will you chill out?<eos> Maybe I'm just happy?<eos> Happy I got some dirt!<eos> Gather 'round, sisters.<eos> So I was taking out the trash, you know, like I do.<eos> And underneath a bunch of two-ply scented toilet paper, that only rich people buy, I found a box for a...<eos> Wait for it...<eos> Pregnancy test.<eos> Now I only found the box, but I know exactly what's going on.<eos> - You do?
Elliot, I'm not playing.<eos> Caroline's not pregnant.<eos> It was Gabi's test.<eos> Hmph, good one.<eos> If you bust in there with this stroller, you're gonna ruin Josh's life forever.<eos> - Now give me that.<eos> - Like hell I will.<eos> Unlike the windows you clean, I can see right through you.<eos> You just want to wheel in the big surprise and get all the credit.<eos> No, I don't!

You bought me a what-now?<eos> I ain't cleaning up after no horse.<eos> A $1,000,000 champion-sired thoroughbred.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Sweetie, it's amazing.<eos> You obviously don't like it.<eos> I wasn't born yesterday.<eos> I know I look like I was, but I wasn't.<eos> No, I love it.<eos> I do.
Your Honor, the defendant is narrating. The question to the defendant only requires a yes-or-no answer, not a chapter in his autobiography.<eos> Mr. Blunt, please restrict yourself to simply answering the questions put to you.<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> I'm sorry. When did you find out about the pregnancy, Erich?<eos> I read about it online... when the autopsy report got leaked.<eos> And what was your reaction?<eos> I've lost a dear friend.<eos> I lost a child.<eos> It hurt.<eos> Still does.
- Howard Weitzman, your thoughts? - Wow.<eos> A... a surprise.<eos> For Erich Blunt, great day.<eos> For District Attorney Jackie Perez, a staggering defeat.<eos> What you can't lose sight of, Susan, is when a jury says "Not guilty," it means the prosecution didn't prove the case.<eos> All right. You good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Two seconds, man.<eos> You still think I did it.<eos> Yeah, we do.
He put a whole playlist on the jukebox and made his grandmother's chili.<eos> Chloe, sweetie, what happened at school?<eos> Everybody either looked at me like I was a freak or just turned away 'cause they didn't know what to say.<eos> I called Dean and begged him to come get me.<eos> You know I loved him, but...<eos> I need a break from being the dead kid's sister.<eos> And it's like I'm buried under it, and I know that you can't understand that.<eos> We do understand.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Yes, yes, yes, we do.
Okay.<eos> Now stop asking me.<eos> He never touched me.<eos> Tommy.<eos> [crying] I don't understand.<eos> I don't understand what's going on.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> I don't know, sweetheart.<eos> I don't understand either.<eos> No, you don't.
Rene thinks you're hiding something, that there's more to the story.<eos> Does she?<eos> Why don't you let us decide if there's more?<eos> Unless you'd prefer that all of Gracepoint learn about your hospital visit.<eos> So you're threatening me?<eos> There must be some part of you that's sick of having a secret.<eos> Keeping a secret like that's exhausting, weighs on your heart.<eos> Hey!<eos> Oh, at least you love me.<eos> Yes, you do.
What do you want?<eos> Well, most people can't answer either of those questions.<eos> Who I am requires a longer explanation than we have time for right now.<eos> What I want... is right here.<eos> In this room.<eos> You.<eos> With your florid, abundant milk production, my Lord.<eos> Which has allowed us to triple her ovum output, by the way. Yes!<eos> You got more eggs inside of you than you know what to do with.<eos> - Yeah, you do!

- Seriously?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hi, I'm just telling a funny story.<eos> It's about Peo. Peo.<eos> What's a Peo? Peo.<eos> Is a... is a... human. Like, uh, that I'm married to. Well, human... yeah, kind of human.<eos> No, but he is the type, he wants to do everything himself.<eos> So he, uh... rented a... You know the, like, when you do floors.<eos> Like a... like a... a sleep machine? Slipmaskin. Slipmaskin.<eos> And, ah... and he did all floors.
If he knew this place existed, don't you think he'd make a move to shut it down like he did with the buses?<eos> Well, he still might.<eos> Couple more days, see if he makes a play.<eos> Couple days?<eos> These aren't guns in crates or drugs in shipping containers.<eos> These are girls, and they're locked up in there like cattle.<eos> If we don't get all the guys, there's just gonna be more girls, okay?<eos> I don't like the cost of this either.<eos> - You don't even know the costs.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Don't make me change my minds.<eos> Your extremely violent behavior in recent days has been described as shocking, homicidal and unforgivable.<eos> I do whatever it takes to protect Gotham.<eos> Bruce Wayne was becoming a threat, so I got rid of him.<eos> And I'll get rid of anyone else who stands in my way.<eos> I am the only justice Gotham City needs.<eos> That appears to be the end of our exclusive live interview with Batman.<eos> I'm Madison Randall, goodnight.<eos> I hope you know what you're doing.<eos> I do. And the clock tower?
We met online, corresponded, chatted a few times.<eos> He told me about your school yard series.<eos> I was intrigued.<eos> The ancient greeks appreciated the beauty of the young male body, unshaven and unspoiled.<eos> I think we both have moved beyond mere appreciation, have we not?<eos> It's all just fantasy.<eos> What if it wasn't?<eos> Forgive me, what business did you say you were in?<eos> I own a furniture design company.<eos> I do very well.
That!<eos> Bus!<eos> Back!<eos> Hey, can you guys turn that down?<eos> I'm trying to read.<eos> Oh, shut up, Brian.<eos> We were here first.<eos> Yeah, Brian, go read in your own room!<eos> I don't have my own room.<eos> Yes, you do.
Hey, guys?<eos> Would you mind if we maybe kept it a secret from Mark, Just like at least until we sell the tickets?<eos> I will carry this to my grave.<eos> Okay, that's intense.<eos> Maggie is going to be your dance coach.<eos> She's amazing.<eos> She's going to help you work out your choreography.<eos> Yeah, don't let this belly fool you.<eos> I still got the moves. Oh.<eos> - Oh, sure she does! - Whoo!

I'm sorry.<eos> I just fell asleep on these stir sticks because I was so incredibly bored.<eos> Can we just paint?<eos> We cannot just paint.<eos> You've been to my house, right?<eos> Yes, and it's impeccable.<eos> And who do you think does all of that work?<eos> Me. Every trim, every fixture.<eos> Do you think that Tina allows me to hang a picture askew?<eos> - No, I do not.
Knock, knock, time to pick up some runaways. Ow, ow, ow,<eos> (gps), no, what's wrong, Louise? ow, ow, ow.<eos> She ate a bite of ice cream, and I guess it upset her cavity. Aw.<eos> Louise couldn't handle her high. Why-why is Teddy here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why are any of us here?<eos> Think about that.<eos> You kids got further in Gayle Force Winds than I thought you would.<eos> Wait, you knew we were playing Gayle Force Winds? Ow.<eos> Um, I-I didn't.
I backed off.<eos> Justin, that is textbook bros before hos.<eos> Okay. You know what?<eos> He's right.<eos> And I'll tell you one more thing I'm gonna do...<eos> I'm gonna toss you an apology.<eos> But I should warn you, my sister and I come from the same fiery Sicilian bloodline, okay?<eos> So if I toss you this apology, and you don't accept it, It's a-gonna be a problem, eh?<eos> You want me to toss you this apology or not?<eos> I do, Danny.
Come. No, I really don't want to.<eos> You're really just a little boy, aren't you?<eos> I can see the light.<eos> You are full of it.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Your friend... He's with the butterflies.<eos> What else did she say?<eos> She said she had Kyle and she wanted me to go see him.<eos> Why didn't you?
Your pulse is slowing... and your heart is struggling, Eldritch.<eos> I can hear it.<eos> Is he here now?<eos> Oh no,<eos> I came here on my own.<eos> I've kept my part of the agreement;<eos> the Master will keep his.<eos> He will not be compelled... or coerced.<eos> He is the Master.<eos> He does... or he does not.
Maybe he had business with them.<eos> Eleanor Nacht went to see Delarge.<eos> We know she works for Fausto Galvan.<eos> That links her to CLIO.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Why are you not seeing this? !<eos> Do you not want to go?<eos> - I'm happy to go by myself! - Did I say that?<eos> I did not say that.<eos> No, I didn't.
There!<eos> They're heading north, narrow your search.<eos> Where are they? Uh... I don't know.<eos> They must've found a gap.<eos> He's obviously knows what he's doing.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> Did you know Catherine was with him?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Wedding dress?<eos> Vincent Keller?<eos> The guy who's all over the news, he killed my brother?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> You remember hearing about that vigilante last year?<eos> The one who killed all those people?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He died.<eos> No, he didn't.
I didn't kill your brother.<eos> Well, I'm told otherwise.<eos> And I think I'll trust my source over a fugitive.<eos> You saved her, and then you took out everybody that tried to hurt her-- including Ray.<eos> Wait, that was you?<eos> You're the one who saved me?<eos> Okay, look, you've got it all wrong.<eos> Lowan is trying to pin this on me, okay?<eos> He is the one who killed your brother and I have a witness to prove it to you.<eos> You do?
She took care of all those kids.<eos> Half of them weren't even hers.<eos> You know, I think she was banging one of them when the cameras were off.<eos> Good night.<eos> Bless you.<eos> Ugh, you're getting it all over the room. Oh, crap.<eos> You know, I'm still waiting on those stars.<eos> I don't understand. Why do you want to wait before we have sex?<eos> - You said you loved me.<eos> - I do.
If I throw up on you, don't take it personally.<eos> I never do.<eos> I can't believe you made me think that you loved me.<eos> How could you do that to me?<eos> Lacey, I'm so sorry. I was desperate.<eos> I was trying to save you from yourself.<eos> I didn't need to be saved.<eos> Even if I got caught, I wasn't going to jail.<eos> Juries love me. You saw my boobs.<eos> I did.
'Cause Julia fired me.<eos> I had to sneak past my own deputies to get in here.<eos> Oh, well... that ain't right.<eos> You're a good man, Phil.<eos> The best sheriff this town's ever had.<eos> Better than Duke?<eos> And Linda.<eos> Your plan to release that virus... you had no other choice, right?<eos> I didn't even have the virus.<eos> Rebecca did.
You killed the ad.<eos> You killed everything.<eos> She's the kind of girl who's gonna shine for the network in her callback for the "Bracken's World" pilot.<eos> What?<eos> Don and I signed Chevy.<eos> Don who?<eos> Our collective ex-wife who still receives alimony?<eos> I agree with Jim.<eos> Do you still love Megan?<eos> Of course I do.
He's gone. Anything else?<eos> This agency is too dependent on creative personalities.<eos> You're still talking for Ted?<eos> If we want people speaking about this agency, what they should be speaking about is our media department.<eos> We need to invest in a computer, period.<eos> We need to tell our clients we're thinking about the future, not creative hijinks.<eos> Don is a genius.<eos> He's costing us a fortune.<eos> - You hate him.<eos> - I don't.
She went next door to distract Mr. DiLaurentis so we could sneak Ali over here.<eos> She better haul us because I'm guessing Jason is not making too many more stops tonight.<eos> Guys, please, enough with Jason for a minute.<eos> Mona knows that we were in New York. Don't you understand?<eos> Okay, it's only a matter of time before she runs out of whistles and start tearing our balloons and say Aria killed Shana.<eos> - Okay, whistles?<eos> - Aria, stop.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mona does not know about Shana.<eos> Then who does? Who?
Too bad she never got to give the message.<eos> What if she did?<eos> Maybe that person, the person she was writing to, the one that she couldn't protect anymore, maybe that's who killed her.<eos> Any idea who that could be?<eos> Yeah, tons of ideas.<eos> All of them pretty nasty.<eos> There's a creaky saying you hear a lot at the meetings:<eos> Do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?<eos> I don't have that choice.<eos> I never did.
That's a very interesting question, and I will have to get back to you on it.<eos> I'm so sorry you had to go talk to Ezra.<eos> Yeah, well, we had to know what he was going to say about New York.<eos> But somebody else could have gone and done that.<eos> No, not really.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> Yeah, I need to know that it didn't happen.<eos> Shana in the theater.<eos> But it did.
He was off his head on booze, he was off his head on skunk.<eos> His girlfriend had dumped him, that's... it's the usual everyday story of country folk.<eos> Where did they take him?<eos> Where did who take him?<eos> The paramedics.<eos> I assume there were paramedics...<eos> I don't know, I didn't ask.<eos> Out of sight, out of mind.<eos> How did you talk him down?<eos> I didn't.
'They see him, they start lobbing his worldly goods, 'his telly, his Wii, his PlayStation, his Xbox, his Game Boy, ' over the balcony, hoping to knock him off his perch.<eos> Of course, by the time I arrive they're well gone and there's just him dangling there with his trousers round his ankles, cos he's wearing those sort of jeans that have come up just below your arse.<eos> Sarge?<eos> 'Catch you later.'<eos> Hello, my little chickadee.<eos> 'Is that Nev? '<eos> It might be.<eos> 'Nevison Gallagher? '<eos> Yes.<eos> 'How you doing, Nevison Gallagher? '
I don't know.<eos> Maybe I am. A disaster channel.<eos> A stalker channel.<eos> I just did three.<eos> Now you.<eos> A channel where professionals investigate and report the news.<eos> Danny Glover just came to mind.<eos> We could have a channel devoted to people who are stalking Danny Glover.<eos> - You think I'm kidding.<eos> - No, I don't.
It just...<eos> Your new job.<eos> Your disapproval of me came up at work?<eos> The page view incentives in your contract.<eos> They're bonuses, you judgmental prick.<eos> And why don't you believe in me?<eos> Why do you assume that as soon as I take a job like this,<eos> - I'm gonna be an asshole?<eos> - I don't think that you're...<eos> Yes, you do. Why?
But the lawyer was here for a weekend.<eos> Three nights, and you could tell he was starting to go a little...<eos> You know, it affected him.<eos> You're gonna be locked in a cage now, and it's not a natural thing.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> That's yours over here.<eos> - You got toiletries?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> You didn't bring toiletries?<eos> Uh, no, I didn't.
'Cause when I said...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I would like to buy your ticket from you at a substantial markup.<eos> - How substantial?<eos> - Twice what your office paid for it.<eos> You can catch the next flight and pocket the difference.<eos> - That's a good deal.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> I don't have a ticket for the flight.<eos> - You don't?
- You'll keep trying, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You did good.<eos> I already know what he'll say.<eos> So do I. I've spoken to him.<eos> - He denied it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What did he say happened?<eos> You don't want to hear it.<eos> - Yes, I do.
That he's been subjected to.<eos> That he's been subjected to.<eos> Petty gossip.<eos> He's talking about proven allegations that priests have been raping children and that bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and maybe even this pope have been protecting the children?<eos> No, the priests.<eos> Benedict fails to mention that in his sermon, which is bad enough, but you failed to mention that in your report Monday.<eos> And that's inexplicable to me.<eos> Bill Donohue...<eos> Yeah, you don't want the Catholic League mad at you.<eos> Nobody does.
And Business Insider is gonna do a profile on me in which I will be likable.<eos> There's something I don't think you're understanding.<eos> What's that?<eos> You have a PR problem because you have an actual problem.<eos> Still don't know why I'm here.<eos> It was a story Charlie wanted because it was a story Pruit wanted and I pretended we couldn't find the Princeton student so we wouldn't have to do the segment.<eos> Charlie knew I was lying, he knew why I was lying.<eos> And I knew he knew why I was lying.<eos> It was a showdown and he lost.<eos> Yes, he did.
I've just had a conversation with someone<eos> I'm only allowed to identify as a senior member of ACN.<eos> - This person told me...<eos> - Sloan?<eos> A senior member of ACN.<eos> You're standing in front of a mirror and 10 feet behind you is Sloan, who's monitoring the conversation.<eos> You want me to join you?<eos> You told him what I told you?<eos> - It had to be done.<eos> - It so didn't.
Hi. Will you go to Disneyland with us tomorrow?<eos> Me?<eos> Really?<eos> Okay, I asked him for you.<eos> Give me my gelato.<eos> Ah. Well, you know,<eos> Jenna and Darcey always sit together on the rides, so, I get crammed into a teacup with a horny, 50-year-old with a Minnie Mouse tramp stamp.<eos> I'm talking about a dude.<eos> Sorry, I'm busy this weekend.<eos> Yeah. You doing some camping?
What-what does that mean?<eos> You're a god, right?<eos> Well, I did rise from the dead, yeah.<eos> Well, then, I guess you should know what that means.<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> It doesn't work at all.<eos> I mean, if you're a god, why didn't you know the truth about my father?<eos> You didn't even know you were a god.<eos> Admit it, you have no idea where we're going.<eos> Yes, I do.
Go, go.<eos> 1,300?<eos> 1,400?<eos> Do I hear 5?<eos> 1,500. 1,600.<eos> Do I hear 7?<eos> 1,700, thank you.<eos> ~ That's it, Tom, you have to stop.<eos> ~ You don't have it in your belt.<eos> Yes, I do.
- They're gonna hang me, John.<eos> -They're not gonna hang you.<eos> Says who?<eos> Tommy.<eos> And how is Houdini gonna get me out of this?<eos> - Well, we...<eos> -Don't tell me.<eos> He's got a plan.<eos> But you don't know what that plan is, do you, John?<eos> I do...
No.<eos> Dani, stop.<eos> Dani, stop hurting her.<eos> Enough, Dani, enough!<eos> Enough.<eos> Winter.<eos> Yes.<eos> Tell me where Bo is.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do.
You're not alone.<eos> Neither is Bo, ever.<eos> She's alone right now, Winter, somewhere.<eos> If that Dani girl hurts her... that is not going to happen.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> 'Cause I think I know where Dani took her.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wait.<eos> We want the same thing, you know.<eos> No, we don't.
Oh, really?<eos> Simple as that, is it?<eos> Yes!<eos> Is it?<eos> Yes. Brush your teeth twice a day and floss after meals.<eos> Fuckin' floss?<eos> What am I, a batty boy now?<eos> Just sort your act out, Kev.<eos> Go to an AA meeting and say that you want to be there.<eos> I don't, particularly.
Or, cos they've lived such a long time, they've got so many stories, they never runs out.<eos> And... I don't mind even hearing a story twice, cos it's so interesting.<eos> Your grandad's interesting.<eos> He's got loads of stories.<eos> He's brilliant.<eos> Yeah, but he can't hear what you say back.<eos> Just listen, then.<eos> Well, will you teach me to make them pretend dragonflies, what fools the fish?<eos> I don't know how.<eos> Yeah, you do.
What?<eos> I have a source... says she's protecting him because Keller was part of some military experiment that super-charged his DNA.<eos> "Super-charged DNA"?<eos> Yep.<eos> And since I know you're all friends, I was hoping you could corroborate.<eos> Listen, I thought you were a reporter, not a sci-fi writer, so...<eos> Tess?<eos> You know that I saw something strange at Cat's apartment that night.<eos> I know that you think you saw something that night and I also know who your so-called source is and he's completely unreliable.<eos> Yes. - You do?
Okay.<eos> Sorry to make you wait.<eos> Yeah, in the middle of the night.<eos> So, you brought the serum?<eos> Actually, I didn't.<eos> - Right.<eos> Because none of this is real, right, Gabe?<eos> Look, I'm not doing this story.<eos> I don't believe Vincent's a beast, or that they even exist.<eos> Well, they do.
Condos?<eos> Condos!<eos> We talking about condos here?<eos> Wait a minute. Sell Wonder Wharf?<eos> What does Mr. Fischoeder say about that?<eos> He says no, because he's a big dumb wiener!<eos> He thinks he can fix that wharf with a few "renovations"?<eos> Does putting a Band-Aid on a fart make it go away?<eos> That doesn't make sense.<eos> Yes, it does.
She's hysterical.<eos> Says she has no idea who would do this to her son.<eos> She know anything about Johnny throwing his last fight?<eos> No. She never saw his fights, never wanted to know anything about them.<eos> And as a mother, I get it.<eos> Does he have any other family?<eos> Seems there's a father who's been out of the picture for years, lives in Honolulu.<eos> But there is an older brother, Bobby.<eos> - She know where Bobby might be?<eos> - She didn't.
You're always erasing the score.<eos> - Hey, shut up!<eos> - Hey...<eos> It's because I'm up.<eos> I was up by a lot.<eos> He's right.<eos> He was.<eos> By 152, to be exact.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
They all follow the same basic pattern.<eos> "We're gathered here today to join these two in holy matrimony."<eos> "Do you take him to be your lawfully wedded spouse?"<eos> And the first person says...<eos> - I do?<eos> - Right.<eos> Then I ask the second person,<eos> "Do you take him to be your lawfully wedded spouse?"<eos> - You know the drill, right?<eos> - I do.
But you don't...<eos> Why are you doing this for me, huh?<eos> Tell me, why are you doing this for me? !<eos> This... this... this is what we do in Hollywood.<eos> You are my client.<eos> I have an obligation to-to protect you, protect your career.<eos> You have a destiny, written in the stars, to be a star.<eos> You're gonna win an Oscar one day.<eos> Do you really think so?<eos> I do.

You're very quiet.<eos> Do you condone this... outrageous behavior?<eos> In fact, I think we should take 50% of the box office.<eos> ♪ You're mine<eos> ♪ And we belong...<eos> Jesus, what the hell was that, gasoline?<eos> It tastes like piss on fire, but it's cheap. It'll get you drunk twice as fast.<eos> Let's have another one.<eos> One's good for me.<eos> I don't do liquor.
And she won't answer my calls or my texts, and she won't even pick up her stuff.<eos> How much stuff are we talkin'?<eos> A lot.<eos> Not to mention her cat.<eos> She left her cat?<eos> You wanna know why?<eos> Because it has one eye and wears a diaper?<eos> No.<eos> Because she wants a reason to come back.<eos> - She does?
I wrote down some things that I didn't get.<eos> Oh, thanks for coming to me about it.<eos> Can you have a look?<eos> Lets see..<eos> Ahhhh!<eos> Basically-<eos> A notebook..<eos> I wrote down some things I don't understand.<eos> Can you have a look?<eos> At the things I don't..
Catherine says can she speak to you?<eos> If... Well, if she wants to.<eos> 'She's just here.'<eos> She says she's sorry, she just changed her mind, that's all.<eos> She's got cancer.<eos> Helen, it's Catherine.<eos> I'm sorry to hear you've not been well.<eos> Oh, that's...<eos> You wanted some advice.<eos> Er, yes, I did, but I...
She wondered if I'll have time to look in tomorrow.<eos> That's all.<eos> I hope your flurry of telephonic communication does not involve bad news, Mr Barrow.<eos> My father's ill, Mr Carson.<eos> Oh, I am sorry. Will you need time off?<eos> Well, I ought to leave in the morning.<eos> Really?<eos> If you want me to see him alive.<eos> Oh, my heaven.<eos> Of course I do.
Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Honestly, Tim!<eos> She'll hear you.<eos> Let her get away.<eos> I can't manage it much longer.<eos> I'm sorry if she's lonely and wants a child but she can't have ours.<eos> You're not being reasonable.<eos> Just now, I thought she'd taken her.<eos> I did, truly.
They'd still have to prove it.<eos> Yes, they would still need proof.<eos> Let's keep a hold of that.<eos> I had such a nice evening.<eos> Me too.<eos> I love London.<eos> Sometimes I forget how much but I do.<eos> I remember when I first arrived.<eos> You don't want to hear about all that.<eos> But I do.
I'm sorry about more than that.<eos> We said a lot of things to each other a long time ago.<eos> We were the land, the water, the sky.<eos> I was gonna change the world and you were gonna build us a cabin.<eos> You and me...<eos> All we used to talk about was stars and trees and mountains.<eos> And let's face it, that was never gonna be enough for you.<eos> Come on. Come on. Come on.<eos> I hope you're happy, Marie.<eos> I really do.
This is mad.<eos> You'll think I'm mad.<eos> It is.<eos> But I think this could possibly be Mandy Sweeting.<eos> Mitch just told me.<eos> What?<eos> You think it might be Mandy Sweeting.<eos> It's pie in the sky.<eos> My dad worked on that case.<eos> So he did.
Look, there's no rule that says you have to walk into school with her tomorrow.<eos> Well, it's not written down but it's understood.<eos> We're gonna walk down those hallways with Ali and everyone will think what they've always thought.<eos> Which is what?<eos> That we're her puppets.<eos> But you're not.<eos> So who cares what they think?<eos> Hey.<eos> People know who you are, Hanna.<eos> They do?
I... I... I won't let you down, Colonel...<eos> - I mean boss.<eos> - Just kidding!<eos> This is your last warning, rookie!<eos> Next time I'll throw... a bigger book at you!<eos> Now get out of my hanger.<eos> Whew, the boss is giving us another chance.<eos> I think he's finally starting to warm up to us.<eos> Check yourself before you wreck yourself.<eos> Oh, You do? !
Hey, Windy, silly question,<eos> - but did you bring any bombs with you?<eos> - Uh, no. Why do you ask?<eos> Well, the only way that door's gonna open is if we blast it open.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe Hudson has some.<eos> Hudson?<eos> You got any bombs, bro?<eos> Funny you should ask that.<eos> I do.
I've made my share of mistakes.<eos> But you have to have the integrity to live with them.<eos> And not look for rich scapegoats.<eos> Objection.<eos> Argumentative.<eos> Withdrawn.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Ms. Silmas, you mentioned integrity as if...<eos> Well, as if you had it.<eos> I do.
Do you want to tell me about your dream?<eos> Pretty scary, huh?<eos> Well, dreams are just your subconscious trying to make sense out of what happens to you during the day.<eos> What's a subconscious?<eos> The secret part of you.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, there's the part of you that's here with me right now.<eos> And there's another part of you that just belongs to you.<eos> I don't think I have that part.<eos> Of course you do.

- Oh, I'm so sorry...<eos> Bruce?<eos> Aubrey?<eos> What... what are you doing here?<eos> What am I doing here?<eos> European comedy tour, obviously.<eos> Yeah, all the major cities of Europe.<eos> London, England, uh, Paris, which is France, and, uh, Berlin, which is the capital of Germany, for example.<eos> Yeah, you really know your capitals.<eos> - Yeah, I do, thanks.
- This is crazy.<eos> I live right here, you know.<eos> I can't believe it!<eos> This is crazy!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Well, I guess we have to hang out because obviously the universe wants us to!<eos> - Yeah, maybe...<eos> - You should put a little... tour of Stockholm inside of me... for me.<eos> Today, if you have the time.<eos> I do, before my... my b... my major show.
you're one of the... guys, uh, from ABBA, you have your own museum.<eos> You are better than everyone else, so...<eos> Let's face it.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> I haven't even told you what my plan was going to be.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> Well... fine.<eos> Then I'm not interested.<eos> You know, I bet you don't even have a photo shoot.<eos> - I do!

I'll be back in an hour.<eos> I've got my prison group.<eos> Oh, wait. I want to hear about how it went with the DUI hearing.<eos> It never happened.<eos> I sent the picture to Maureen and the whole thing went away.<eos> See?<eos> Oh, the universe is good and wonderful.<eos> Everything is right.<eos> You had sex last night, didn't you?<eos> Yes, I did.
Look, I'm just doing a friend a favor.<eos> It's really not a big deal.<eos> What friend?<eos> What does Ida Bankowski have to do with anything?<eos> The Bankowski case is closed.<eos> Well, she's missing and my friend wants to find her, see if she's okay.<eos> When did the Roundhouse become your personal investigation resource?<eos> The intelligence officer who monitors that database reports to the commissioner every time he sees a red flag.<eos> Like why is a vice cop looking for investigative information on a homicide that's none of his business?<eos> Nothing to do with his caseload.
Oh, no, they'd they'd hold fate responsible.<eos> ~ It was predetermined. ~ Cut!<eos> It's Sophocles.<eos> ~ MAN: Cut!<eos> ~ What?<eos> ~ Karen? ~ Sorry, Wesley. "Oedipus Rex".<eos> It's Sophocles.<eos> ~ Yes?<eos> ~ Well, you said Aristotle.<eos> ~ Did I?
I only know what they said about it on the news.<eos> It does sound very familiar, though.<eos> You're running this one, aren't you?<eos> What happened to Robbie Lewis?<eos> If there's a connection to you, you know we'll find it.<eos> You'll find a connection whether one exists or not.<eos> Isn't that how it works?<eos> Next you'll be telling me I walked out of here and did it.<eos> ~ You know who did it, though, don't you?<eos> ~ Course I do.
She was.<eos> She was in a secure facility.<eos> No one pulled her out.<eos> She left on her own.<eos> We didn't do enough.<eos> She made her choice.<eos> And I would like to know who made the choice to green-light her, 'cause God knows it wasn't this clown.<eos> Come on, Tino, who did it?<eos> Who gave the order?<eos> I did.
And now not even thank me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> No money and no ability. What would you do without me?<eos> Health!<eos> Congratulations, man!<eos> Thanks.<eos> Once you have promoted.<eos> What is your secret?<eos> Just work hard, I would say.<eos> But but what I do too.
You've pitted yourself against them from the start.<eos> How can you retreat from that position?<eos> You mean I've made it 'them or me'?<eos> Haven't you?<eos> You despise the family, but I think you forget my wife was one of them.<eos> My child IS one of them.<eos> Where does that leave me?<eos> Don't you despise them?<eos> Really?<eos> No, I don't.
You'll be a while.<eos> She lives in Omaha.<eos> You sure there's no other family we can call? Uh... The only other family I have left is Erich Blunt.<eos> I understand.<eos> Don't be shy.<eos> Just slide it in there, nice and easy.<eos> Erich?<eos> Sorry, we have a situation.<eos> Who the hell let you in, Leonard?<eos> I did.
That's a criminal offense.<eos> - Well, that's debatable.<eos> - Alicia, it is not debatable.<eos> You bribed a prosecutor to drop drug charges against your sister.<eos> I didn't bribe the prose...<eos> You cut a deal to lessen charges on another case.<eos> - That's a bribe.<eos> - You don't know what you're doing. - I do.<eos> - You don't realize the ramifications...<eos> You don't.
- Diane?<eos> - Yes, Howard actually<eos> - has some questions.<eos> - Wait. What?<eos> Howard is going to examine Alicia.<eos> - He... no, he isn't.<eos> - Yes, he is.<eos> I have the utmost confidence in Howard.<eos> You don't, David?<eos> Do you,
These girls are my infatuation.<eos> God's greatest creation.<eos> They have the power to put my body in physical depression, encouraging the animal inside of me to take on a sexual aggression.<eos> My words are inspired by the curves and that's just a little lyrical confession.<eos> - Inspired by the curves, huh? - Okay.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> You hear that?<eos> - You hear him?<eos> You hear your son?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Please let me have some peace.<eos> (Reporters shouting) Rev. Cheeks: That's all for now.<eos> No more questions.<eos> (crowd booing) I know you're angry and you have every right to be.<eos> All right, but you know what I'm so proud of?<eos> The fact that you came out here tonight to figure it out together without taking matters into your own hands.<eos> Man: This wouldn't be happening if he were a black man on death row!<eos> - Exactly!<eos> - Adam: I hear you, brother.<eos> I do.
And I'll tell the police I saw it and they'll make a report and whether it's true or not, some facts will support it, some won't, but people will decide for themselves because of what they're told and what cops write in reports and she'll be arrested.<eos> Okay, so you're saying that all guilty people are innocent?<eos> Are you saying innocent people never get convicted?<eos> No. Look, I know mistakes are made, but most of the time the guilty are guilty because the facts prove that they are.<eos> Most of the time.<eos> My father has one more appeal in about eight months.<eos> And Bankowski, well, like it or not, he's about the only execution I have handy right now.<eos> If I can find just one tiny crack in one death penalty verdict, then maybe I'll find another one in another case, and another.<eos> Look, if you don't respect the effort, I get it.<eos> No, I do.
Ah, well, I'm not going to drink.<eos> It's the middle of the day. (Laughs)<eos> Waiter?<eos> I should...<eos> I can't... I can't show this.<eos> I can't show it. Um, how do I turn it off?<eos> Do you know what... (Sighs) I'm afraid to push a button.<eos> I don't want to delete anything.<eos> Do you guys know? Do you know what...<eos> To do? You don't.
- Good luck.<eos> - Yeah, fine.<eos> Okay. If this is what you wanna do, then I'm happy for you.<eos> - I'm happy for all of you.<eos> - Okay. - Well... Yeah.<eos> Okay. - Good luck.<eos> Lisa: Call Camille.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Andy doesn't need to see that. (Laughs)<eos> - No, he doesn't.
I'm Valerie Cherish.<eos> I... I heard.<eos> I loved Valerie's first sitcom, "I'm it."<eos> We used to watch it in my dorm room and smoke dope.<eos> - So fun. - Valerie:<eos> Oh. (Laughs)<eos> Val is legendary.<eos> Aw.<eos> We tried to work together a few years ago.<eos> - Valerie: Yes, we did.

- Valerie: Yes, we did.<eos> - Yeah. We did.<eos> What are you up to now?<eos> Um, well, just working on a little something right now.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> Yeah. Hey.<eos> Are you...<eos> I thought you were texting. Are you shooting?<eos> Well, it's not for broadcast. Don't worry.<eos> Yeah. Just doing a little pilot presentation.
Which one?<eos> - Echols.<eos> - Never heard of it.<eos> It's not convenient.<eos> Of course it isn't.<eos> So... what about Christmas?<eos> Or birthdays?<eos> Will they let you visit?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Exactly.<eos> - Parsonage.<eos> I've got a good feeling about this lottery.<eos> Yeah, you sure you don't want us to pick you up a ticket?<eos> Do all boys lie? Hm?<eos> I thought these two were different.<eos> - That's quite a tale.<eos> - A tall one at that.<eos> And this relates to the Marie Godfrey case in what way?<eos> - It doesn't.
We just sat there by her bed hoping she was asleep.<eos> But she wasn't. And we knew it.<eos> In the end I had to call grandmother. Dad just couldn't.<eos> Come here, little darling.<eos> Why do we say such stupid things to each other?<eos> Because you forget to think.<eos> But it doesn't matter.<eos> And your mum knows that you didn't mean it.<eos> She does?<eos> - Yes, she does.

I'm afraid the service is ended.<eos> I was hoping to speak to more than just a few of the die-hard faithful.<eos> Where's the rest of your flock got to?<eos> - Paris, France?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Ooh, you don't want to go and live there.<eos> They never bathe.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I heard they don't have showers in their houses.<eos> Of course they do.
I like.... I like the sound it makes.<eos> Did you?<eos> Yeah, it's like a... "donk"!<eos> You were happy with that, were you?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Over the moon with that, the donk.<eos> It was quite funny, actually.<eos> It was quite a laugh.<eos> Oh, he deserved it an' all, that's...<eos> He did.
You should Netflix it.<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> Oh!<eos> Jane, Jane. Sound familiar?<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Valerie!<eos> I thought, "who is this?"<eos> And then I saw the cameras and I knew it was you.<eos> You never give up.<eos> Well, you do.
Paulie's changed.<eos> This is good stuff.<eos> It is. It is.<eos> You know, I don't know, Jane.<eos> Did you know...<eos> That he was, um...<eos> Doing heroin?<eos> When we were shooting "room and bored."<eos> Yeah. I saw him shoot up once.<eos> You did?
Yeah, that will be fun.<eos> Somebody say, "Golden Globes"?<eos> Oh! Look at Mr. Mike!<eos> Hats off.<eos> Here we come.<eos> Those beautiful girls!<eos> Uh, limo's here.<eos> Well, here we are, four on the town.<eos> Got the tickets, Mark?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Liz, hi.<eos> Just wanted to say...<eos> This isn't what we normally do... you know, this stuff, the special effects.<eos> I'm ripping a child apart.<eos> I don't know what they're gonna have me do for an encore.<eos> Eat Santa Klaus?<eos> Don't worry, I know this isn't representative of the entire season.<eos> Yeah. Okay, good.<eos> I saw the first episode.<eos> - Oh, you did?
Use that when an actress is, you know...<eos> Playing a man, not wearing makeup, or gained 50 lbs.<eos> - You know, that's what I thought.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - That's not what I meant.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> - Valerie.<eos> I think people are going to see you in a whole new light when this show premiers.<eos> You do?
So, what?<eos> She's just being dragged off the soundstage bound and gagged?<eos> No one says anything or does anything?<eos> Andie, snakes aside, no one's gonna believe that.<eos> Right?<eos> So, then we do all this, right? And you just cut it in editing?<eos> Okay, you're getting me.<eos> I hear you. Yeah.<eos> You want to go talk to Paulie about it?<eos> No, I don't.
Or worse, cruise into the Yak Zone.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> It's totally fine.<eos> The trick is to keep a tally of how many you drink.<eos> Here.<eos> Ooh, sorry.<eos> Oh, my God, Mrs. Hamil-- Shh! That's the best part about college.<eos> You get exposed to all these cool people, like pretty girls with killer taste in books.<eos> Do you want to get out of here?<eos> I absolutely do.
Were you?<eos> Alison.<eos> I can't live in a world where I jump every time the doorbell rings.<eos> So what?<eos> You're just gonna run away?<eos> Please don't tell the girls or try to stop me.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Say that you were kidnapped again?<eos> Do you think I want to live like this?<eos> Because I don't.
Are... are they deceased?<eos> No.<eos> They're in Buffalo.<eos> It's a blue collar couple.<eos> Nurse and bookkeeper sacrificed everything to send Kendell down here so she could get the best education.<eos> - Ah, I feel for them. - (Clears throat)<eos> They try to do their best they can for their daughter, and she ends up over her head at 37th Prep.<eos> Don't tell me you have a compassionate side, Eliot.<eos> I understand what she's going through, that's all.<eos> You do?
She... she's gotta be alive.<eos> She's gotta be alive.<eos> Right?<eos> She lived?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm so scared.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't know...<eos> I don't know how to pray, Oliver.<eos> - You do.
I mean, she had it all!<eos> But it wasn't her dream.<eos> Well, she did admit her life's dream was to be on the stage.<eos> And if Mrs. Kipperman's bursitis keeps up, then she will be.<eos> Could you pass the salt and pepper, please?<eos> I guess it's just never too late, like you said, Norman.<eos> Do you have a dream you'd like to share with us, Rita?<eos> Yes!<eos> I... No.<eos> Yes, I... do.
Hey, where'd that barrier go?<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> Valerie broke it down.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> That's gonna have to wait.<eos> I actually came out here to reschedule.<eos> Everyone is calling me with trade proposals.<eos> It's amazing how many people want to play with the Rangers.<eos> Well, I know I do.<eos> Yeah, he does!
Oh, yes you can, Danny.<eos> You need to grow up... And I need to let you do it.<eos> What about team Wheeler?<eos> I will always be on your team.<eos> I'm your mother.<eos> Well, how about we go get some victory libations.<eos> Ah, word of the day?<eos> Nope.<eos> I actually knew that one.<eos> You did?
All right.<eos> On three.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Knock-knock.<eos> Child services.<eos> Yeah, you really should get used to hearing that.<eos> Danny, just put her down.<eos> It's not like she has a limited number of steps in her.<eos> Well, what if she does?
Okay, folks.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> So, I'd like to call on Emma's two amazing godfathers.<eos> - Ready to go, dude.<eos> - We're on it.<eos> Her one incredible godmother.<eos> That's me.<eos> Her two one-of-a-kind grandparents.<eos> - Oh, we love you.<eos> - Yes, we do.
- It's Ted.<eos> Ted's on the phone. Oh.<eos> Hello.<eos> I've seen the work so far.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> And what would you do?<eos> I would use everything at my disposal to win it.<eos> If you think George Payton will prefer it, I'm not going to ignore that.<eos> You know that she's every bit as good as any woman in this business!<eos> I do.
I kissed Joe.<eos> I know.<eos> I just wanted to feel normal for a minute.<eos> - Melanie, you are normal.<eos> - I died.<eos> Nothing about me is normal.<eos> Why am I even here?<eos> Because I'm connected to some egg?<eos> That no one even knows where it is.<eos> Actually, I do.
Very nice. Very nice.<eos> How do I look? Oh!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Uh... Well, that's a very challenging palette For you, angela, but you seem to be pulling it off.<eos> [ sighs ] damn. What can I do to look worse?<eos> Ma, you look like a russian nesting doll.<eos> What is up?<eos> I'm breaking up with sean today And I didn't want to look too good. To get him all hot and bothered<eos> And then dump him would be cruel. I-I thought that you liked lieutenant cavanaugh?<eos> I do, very much.
- Well, you did.<eos> It's just too bad the stain was on the signature.<eos> I know.<eos> I made it worse.<eos> Jane brought it to me because she thinks I'm some kind of whiz with the stain removal.<eos> Yeah, she did say once that you got motor oil out of her communion dress.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kind of.<eos> I-I bought her a new one.<eos> - So you kind of didn't.
Oh, come on.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> I can't take this shit out here anymore, man. Mmm.<eos> Bro... we need to lose some weight.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> We need to lose some weight.<eos> I... I know.<eos> Well, you want to try?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I can't miss.<eos> So, I cock the hammer, close my eyes and fire... ..and its fucking head explodes.<eos> You are so badass.<eos> Where were this?<eos> Roarton.<eos> No, where in Roarton?<eos> The Save'n'Shop.<eos> Um... Jem?<eos> I was wondering if you had a partner for the show-and-tell tomorrow.<eos> Cos if you didn't...
I did knock.<eos> Hello.<eos> Charlotte, this is my brother. Hey.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, er... my spare cover-up mousse.<eos> You can have it back.<eos> Why would I want your...<eos> I... I don't use your... stuff.<eos> I know you do, Jem.<eos> I don't, Kier.
Where'd you go?<eos> Stop looking at porn!<eos> Shut up, for, like, a second.<eos> Are you talking to boys?<eos> Hey, I'm writing an email.<eos> Stop.<eos> ...from the horse's mouth.<eos> Guys, did you talk to Val tonight?<eos> Oh, dude, when we were at Adam's party, she was telling people I had a drinking problem.<eos> You do.
Adam, stop.<eos> Did he touch you again?<eos> Did he touch you again down there?<eos> Just for a second, okay?<eos> Just for a second.<eos> She's not lying, Mitch.<eos> She's not, okay?<eos> - Okay? - Now show me the paper.<eos> You don't want me to show you the paper.<eos> No, I do, Blaire.
Oh, my God!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Mitchie.<eos> Do you see...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What is that?<eos> It's an alarm I set for tomorrow.<eos> We have a test.<eos> We do?
Yeah, I drawed it cos I wishes there was a cat there anyway.<eos> OK. I always wishes there was a cat there.<eos> I wish there... Oh! Next time, we should draw a cat.<eos> Good idea.<eos> It's a true story.<eos> Don't see any fruit.<eos> Oh, there's fruit, love.<eos> I got a kumquat up my rectum.<eos> The dwarf can't believe his luck.<eos> 'We do loads of classes.
Emus. What's the difference?<eos> Rod Hull had an emu.<eos> Bernie Clifton was on an ostrich.<eos> That's how I tells, anyway.<eos> Anyway.<eos> I just... just want to get it out there, mate.<eos> What?<eos> All those problems we've been having, me and Janice.<eos> I dunno.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I dunno.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She left me.<eos> Been putting it about a bit.<eos> Word on the street, she's now called the hefty gobbler.<eos> Ah. Nah, we're better than ever now.<eos> Sex.<eos> I dunno.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- What's this?<eos> Miss Bunting is giving instruction to Mrs Patmore's undercook.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I heard about that.<eos> You sound as if you don't approve.<eos> I approve.<eos> As long as you're not making... her unsettled.<eos> You don't know her name, do you?<eos> Sarah, please.<eos> Of course he does.
You saved my life.<eos> - Don't know about that.<eos> - You did.<eos> Well, if I did, then you provided the context for me doing so.<eos> - What?<eos> - I was screwed either way, so I went with the choice that helped someone.<eos> I thought it trite, but it turned out to be true.<eos> - Point to you.<eos> - You have this.<eos> Even if you didn't before, you do.
And that's what I wanted to know.<eos> Why would the company I loved so much decide to bury its future?<eos> The whole ET story is a very small part of the Atari story.<eos> Let me go back and let me explain how Atari started out.<eos> The video game came because of the convergence of me working in an amusement park summers, while pursuing an engineering degree at the University of Utah.<eos> I knew the economics of the coin operated game business.<eos> They made a lot of money.<eos> Nolan designed these incredibly elegant circuits. Put together in a way that's so clever that modern engineers have a hard time, you know, understanding and repairing these things.<eos> My partner and I, Ted Dabney, started working on a ping-pong game.<eos> By the end of '72, we did $3.5 million.
Oh, I forgot.<eos> I have to do it in English.<eos> I don't know if I can do that.<eos> Let me see.<eos> You have to picture-- I was a very young girl and very pretty, all right, when I sing.<eos> You mean like now.<eos> No, no, no, like then.<eos> Okay.<eos> ♪ I love you ♪<eos> ♪ Oh yes I do ♪
It's over?<eos> Let's talk about the real reason you don't like private school.<eos> What?<eos> It's about you.<eos> And that you grew up working class and you have a chip on your shoulder about people who can send their kids to private schools.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop now.<eos> And the fact is that you can't afford it and you resent it, and I can afford it.<eos> Janet, just 'cause you make more now doesn't mean that you get to have more decision over what our kids do.<eos> Actually it does.
Sue and Darrin were seeing a lot more of each other which meant we were also seeing a lot more of Sue and Darrin.<eos> Oh, my God, Darrin.<eos> You have crazy-long eyelashes.<eos> Oh, no, they're not so long.<eos> No, they are. Look at them!<eos> [ Laughs ] You can't look at your own eyes.<eos> I love how you scrunch your nose when you laugh.<eos> [ Volume increases ] You have the cutest laugh.<eos> I do not. [ Laughs ]<eos> Yes, you do.
Italian wedding cookies.<eos> Well, that's my ride to the Kay Kyser Big Band Experience.<eos> Oh, don't wait up.<eos> We might stop afterwards and get a little nosh.<eos> Mike.<eos> I came into the kitchen.<eos> Yes.<eos> I can see that.<eos> And do you know why?<eos> 'Cause I do.
You know, Axl had girls over all the time, and he never confronted them.<eos> Axl, tell her. Tell her!<eos> Tell her. Tell her!<eos> Okay, everybody just needs to calm down and give me a minute.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This is our time now.<eos> You can't take one of our minutes.<eos> Come on, mom.<eos> Silligan noses don't grow on trees.<eos> Actually, they do in one book, but--
Oh, no, this is breaking bad.<eos> Oh, Juju, this is so much fun.<eos> How much longer?<eos> They're right there.<eos> I know.<eos> How much longer?<eos> Aren't these two so cute together?<eos> The way they keep scooting towards each other.<eos> So, did Sofia tell you that she got promoted at work?<eos> You did?
- Yes!<eos> - In the middle.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm so happy.<eos> Me too.<eos> - It's like a fresh start.<eos> - I know.<eos> And you had your thing with Marcus, I had my thing with Aubrey and we just forget about...<eos> I-I didn't do anything with Marcus.
And I have two children in catholic school.<eos> You ever date this girl?<eos> She goes by the name Lisette.<eos> - Or maybe Ellie.<eos> - Yeah, I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I'm not really paying attention to their faces, so...<eos> You want to look again?<eos> - I don't know her.<eos> - Yeah, you do, Luna.
How you doing? Yeah, hit me.<eos> You guys are bad luck, man.<eos> How long have you been here?<eos> I don't know, but I'm tapped out. How'd you get tapped in?<eos> $10,000 line of credit.<eos> Damn it. [Sighs]<eos> This is from the Golden Oasis.<eos> I used to play there. It's no problem, sir.<eos> We accept Golden Oasis chips.<eos> - You do? - Yep.
What's it to do with?<eos> Put your head between your knees.<eos> Hello?<eos> Right...<eos> The thing is, Nevison... The thing is...<eos> I may be wrong...<eos> I may be wrong, but the thing is... ..I think I might know who these people are.<eos> -Did you see anything? -No.<eos> No.<eos> I-I didn't.
OK.<eos> Just go home, carry on as normal, and we'll be in touch.<eos> Have you got a minute?<eos> I didn't plan this.<eos> She turned up at the mission.<eos> Only because she was worried about me and even then...<eos> I keep thinking about Kevin. Why Kevin?<eos> Why did they ask for Kevin to deliver the money?<eos> -How well do you know them?<eos> -I don't.
To support a store.<eos> No, they're here.<eos> You just got to reach them.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Then you're on the hook when some lowlife Misses a payment for $2,000 worth of chrome.<eos> That's a great plan, brother.<eos> The big rent-to-own chains, They're pulling in more than $150 million a year, kent.<eos> All right, they can't do that If the customers aren't paying their goddamn bills.<eos> Well, you got a point.<eos> Yeah, I do.
That son of a bitch is never gonna be alone with her again.<eos> I can promise you that.<eos> This would rip my family apart.<eos> Rip them apart.<eos> My mom...<eos> My dad...<eos> Everybody.<eos> It'd be over.<eos> I feel for you, son.<eos> I do.
Um... yes.<eos> Oh, sh-shit!<eos> Good morning.<eos> I'm sorry, Ted.<eos> I've heard worse.<eos> No, I mean...<eos> I'm sorry about the kitchen, about... how things are.<eos> I'm getting kind of used to it.<eos> I thought he'd stay home for a while.<eos> I really did.
Yes, both, I guess.<eos> So if I believe there is no God, then there is no God.<eos> It's not the same thing.<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause you're just lost, Daniel.<eos> Something we can agree upon.<eos> I know God loves you, Daniel.<eos> You said that before.<eos> Or was it Jesus who loved me?<eos> They both do.
I like these.<eos> I think I might try to work out a deal with him.<eos> Janet...<eos> I've got some news.<eos> I really don't want to have to tell you this.<eos> He came by the house.<eos> Who?<eos> Teddy.<eos> He told you?<eos> He did.
You'll be a granddaddy someday. [ chuckles ] [ tape whirring ]<eos> Holden. You've got a visitor.<eos> Who is it? [ door buzzes ] Mother sends her love.<eos> I thought it'd be easier for us not to see each other.<eos> But it's... Not easier.<eos> No.<eos> It's not.<eos> How's the gas company?<eos> They promoted me.<eos> They did?
I didn't think so.<eos> Don't tell mother for a while, okay? [ sighs ] Do you need my bike today?<eos> No.<eos> Thanks for letting me use it, though.<eos> I liked knowing you were riding it.<eos> It's a good bike.<eos> Well, uh...<eos> See ya. [ footsteps approach ] No tie?<eos> Amantha picked out this tie, didn't she?<eos> Yes, she did.
What are you saying?<eos> That's a form of justice.<eos> Might work, it might not.<eos> You should've told me he was here.<eos> I cannot wait to see the look on Sebastian Cerisola's face when we ask him about Chuchito and Yusando.<eos> He's gonna talk to us?<eos> They said we could wait as long as we like while Señor Cerisola considers our interview request.<eos> That is a polite cock block.<eos> You really think so?<eos> Yes, I do.
Every set of beats tells of the Khan's mandate.<eos> And what do they say this night?<eos> War.<eos> "Those skilled in warfare move the enemy, and are not moved by the enemy.<eos> Get the enemy to approach by his own accord.<eos> If he's at ease, exhaust him.<eos> Well fed, starve him.<eos> Settled, move him."<eos> I never knew you gave much merit to Sun Tzu's treatise on war.<eos> I don't.
Security had no sense of romance.<eos> Finally had to buy a ticket.<eos> - To London?<eos> - Newark.<eos> It's the London of New Jersey.<eos> I can't let you do this.<eos> Okay?<eos> I can't let you walk away from this relationship.<eos> I don't think I have a choice.<eos> You do.
It's getting closer.<eos> It's coming from the north.<eos> There!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> It only attacks when it feels threatened.<eos> Pistol, sword...<eos> Hook, my cunning wit --<eos> I don't think we have what it takes.<eos> Emma does.
It's all right here.<eos> FBI tends to be pretty thorough.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's just... It's a gut instinct, Nolan. I can't explain it.<eos> Well, maybe his interview tonight will.<eos> If he's hiding something from the FBI, he's not gonna announce it to the whole world on live television.<eos> Ems, I respect your instinct, but I think you're looking for an easier answer.<eos> 'Cause the truth is anything but.<eos> It's hard to accept that this happened to someone that we love.<eos> But it did.
All right, let's run the drill one more time.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, Jaysene!<eos> Uh, now that we're done with our training, I was wondering if you wanted to, uh, go out some time?<eos> I'm sorry, I've met someone else I'm interested in.<eos> I see.<eos> Hmm. Why don't you take a little longer there, Lavon?<eos> Not like we have a fire to put out or anything.<eos> Hey, we had an understanding!<eos> No, we didn't.
If there are 48 of us here, we still have people out there.<eos> The patrol brought in everyone they could find.<eos> What about the Ark?<eos> It came down last...<eos> We saw it.<eos> There were multiple crash sites over 100 square miles.<eos> If there were survivors, we will bring them in, too.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I want to see my people.<eos> Of course you do.
Great.<eos> See you on Saturday.<eos> While I was spinning my web of lies, my brother and sister were working on<eos> - Uh, with double prints, your film comes out to $17.23.<eos> Before the age of digital cameras, you actually had to venture across town to get your pictures from a creepy guy in a vest.<eos> There's your pictures.<eos> Nice pecs.<eos> What do you do, high weight, low reps?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I do arms on weekends, legs on Thursday...
Boy, I bet you'd clean up at Forest Lawn.<eos> - No, it's not like that.<eos> - Oh, no? Her friend practically died in my arms.<eos> Well, guess what, Romeo?<eos> Your one-night stand has now turned into a meaningful relationship.<eos> All right, I'm with you.<eos> Let me call the hotel.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I lost my phone.<eos> The things they did to this room.
You look nice.<eos> Today's my interview.<eos> Today's your interview.<eos> You said you could take the kids to school.<eos> Of course I'm taking the kids to school, right, kids?<eos> What's an interview?<eos> - Mommy's getting a job.<eos> - Trying to get a job.<eos> Do you want it?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> See you then.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Patti, you ready to come in?<eos> It's a cat?<eos> Yeah. Ha ha ha!<eos> But it has a pop tart for its body, and it's just shooting through space and it has rainbows coming out of its butt and it's just really happy about it.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> No, dad, you don't.
Did you just smoke?<eos> What?<eos> You smell like cigarettes.<eos> I mean, I don't really care.<eos> You're the one that wanted to quit.<eos> Just be honest, this time.<eos> "This time"?<eos> Tommy told me about Michael.<eos> Oh, so what, you're... you're angry 'cause I didn't say something?<eos> Why didn't you?
"This time"?<eos> Tommy told me about Michael.<eos> Oh, so what, you're... you're angry 'cause I didn't say something?<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> 'Cause it's not my fuckin' place.<eos> What is your place, Kevin?<eos> Is it here?<eos> Be honest.<eos> You don't want me to be honest.<eos> Yes, I do.
You can't help them.<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> I know I can 'cause I'm supposed to.<eos> But you need to tell me why she did what she did.<eos> You need to tell me what she said.<eos> She said...<eos> I understand.<eos> Understood what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sure you do.
Excessive?<eos> Really?<eos> - Struck by Cupid's magic arrow.<eos> - It's off, Lily.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Two hours rehearsing with rosa?<eos> Cam, what is going on with you?<eos> We just had the most romantic year ever, planning our ceremony, the wedding, the honeymoon, And I'm just worried if we let this go, we'll never get it back.<eos> - That doesn't all just end.<eos> - It did once.
- Hey. - Is that some kind of going away present?<eos> Uh, it's my, uh, overnight bag.<eos> Listen, Scarlett.<eos> I got to get the hell out of this town.<eos> Can I hitch a ride with you? [Door opens] You up yet?<eos> I brought you some coffee.<eos> Did you ever feel anything? [Sniffles]<eos> Did you ever love me...<eos> - At all?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Uh, it's my, uh, overnight bag.<eos> Listen, Scarlett.<eos> I got to get the hell out of this town.<eos> Can I hitch a ride with you? [Door opens] You up yet?<eos> I brought you some coffee.<eos> Did you ever feel anything? [Sniffles]<eos> Did you ever love me...<eos> - At all?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> - I do.
My head literally is about to explode.<eos> You haven't given yourself time to think it through.<eos> Yeah, I have. No.<eos> Remember that whole thing?<eos> It nearly killed me.<eos> Well, yeah, but what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?<eos> Please stop talking.<eos> I really got to get on the road, guys.<eos> Gunnar, get out of the car.<eos> - No, you don't.
I am.<eos> She'll know that I did.<eos> But the only way we beat them is from the other side.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> A good man is hard to find.<eos> He was taken from me much too young.<eos> It's a symbol of a person I was and can be again.<eos> You and me have something in common.<eos> We do, huh?
Oh my god.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Those eels?<eos> Oh actually they're not eels. These are Lampreys. They're uh-<eos> Oh what are you?<eos> Are you a Fish and Wildlife service?<eos> Oh my, look at you.<eos> So you know all about that stuff.<eos> Little bit, yeah.<eos> - Totally do. - Yeah.
Word with you outside, Chief?<eos> Something tells me you're about to get some excellent advice.<eos> - Fuck are you doin'?<eos> - What?<eos> I signed up for this little adventure under the countenance of strong and decisive leadership, but now, lo and behold, that leader is now gone, and the man currently residing in his skin clearly has no fuckin' idea what is happening in there.<eos> When we did this last night...<eos> What did I say I wanted?<eos> You said it was time to end it.<eos> I don't want to hurt her.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
Oh, which one?<eos> That hoverboards exist, or that it was Zelda in the dress?<eos> Both. Which one you want me to prove first?<eos> Hoverboards.<eos> Silver dress it is.<eos> I made you breakfast.<eos> This is Stephie, Zelda's friend from law school.<eos> She likes whatever her boyfriends like and giving relationship advice.<eos> I thought you really liked him.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Your path from lost girl to devil's assistant is one that I walked, too.<eos> I would protect you as I would mine own self.<eos> Now, Tituba's released, rewarded for her treachery, and you live like an animal, hunted and fearful.<eos> So how will I do it and when?<eos> Easy, my dear.<eos> Many a witch has sought to claim Increase's life and lost theirs in the process.<eos> Our efforts must be planned... Carefully.<eos> Surely you must have a method in mind.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Correct.<eos> You pre-med?<eos> I'm hoping to be.<eos> I'll check back in a couple hours.<eos> I don't care what his maximum is, okay?<eos> I will cover whatever you wont!<eos> I don't know, but I would imagine a few more weeks in the hospital and some kind of physical therapy at home.<eos> Honey, the S.A.T. is today.<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> Of course it does.
- I just want the truth!<eos> I'm serious. Go home, pack your stuff, and get out!<eos> We'll be better off without you.<eos> Fine!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Me too, there has to be some mistake with this test.<eos> - I believe you.<eos> - You do?
What did you just watch?<eos> A video of a...<eos> I can't think of anything!<eos> We saw your sex tape.<eos> You couldn't say "cat"?<eos> Half the internet is videos of cats, Will.<eos> You watched our sex tape?<eos> !<eos> Not just me.<eos> We all did.
I can't help you with this guy.<eos> Come back with more.<eos> Maybe we'll talk.<eos> Well, maybe we can talk anyhow sometime.<eos> You know where to find me.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> Well, she does have a point.<eos> No, she's wrong.<eos> I don't always have to be right.<eos> - Yeah, you kind of do.
I'd rather like things than not like it, like you.<eos> I like things.<eos> It's making me angry.<eos> Come on...!<eos> What?<eos> Lay off, Geoff, yeah?<eos> Oh, sorry, have I wound him up, have I touched a nerve.<eos> Sorry, mate.<eos> Common sense has just gone out the window in this place.<eos> Does my head in, this place.
How's getting a job not growing up?<eos> Because you're running away.<eos> I'm not running away.<eos> I'd be going to earn some money then coming home again like normal people do.<eos> Oh, so screw the relationship.<eos> Screwing it?<eos> That's helping our relationship.<eos> I thought we were trying for a baby?<eos> We did try for a baby.<eos> We DID? Right.
Why?<eos> He's got cancer.<eos> No, he hasn't.<eos> He's really not very well, Derek, and they ha... What will they do?<eos> How will they...<eos> They give him...<eos> They're going to put him down.<eos> Why's...? He's not in any pain now but if they don't do it then he will be in pain.<eos> And they just called to let you know, in case you wanted to go...<eos> Yeah, I do.
Sorry, I didn't mean...<eos> You're going to have to direct me from here.<eos> Oh, turn left here... and we're at the end.<eos> It's not that bad, is it?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No, no.<eos> I think I used to live round here.<eos> You think you did? !<eos> Yeah, I did.
I thought, erm...<eos> Well, you know, for a minute, I thought...<eos> Yeah, well... the IRA tried to kill me in the morning and you tried to kill me in the afternoon.<eos> Sam!<eos> Yeah, but don't worry, I'd feel like shit if I was in your shoes, but we move on.<eos> Get Charlie to tell you what he just told me.<eos> This is genius.<eos> You'll love it.<eos> I'm sure you don't want to hear it again.<eos> Of course I do, love.
- Mm-hmm, let's do it.<eos> - Is this every Wednesday?<eos> - Every Wednesday.<eos> I don't have any cash at all.<eos> Why are the car seats down?<eos> Oh, I... I moved them when Tammy and I went to the tile place.<eos> No, no.<eos> That one goes over there.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does.
- Bye.<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> Nope.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm going into town in a bit if you want to join, get out?<eos> Yeah. You yell up at me when you're going?<eos> That's brutal, man.<eos> Maybe she wants you to go after her.<eos> No.<eos> She doesn't.
- I could give her a call.<eos> - I said "part of me," Les.<eos> Look, you're the bravest guy I know.<eos> So don't let her go without saying everything that you need to say.<eos> Fine.<eos> I really hate that you're leaving, but part of the reason that I fell for you in the first place is because you are the type of girl that would go and help your mom.<eos> And I'm not gonna take it back, Nicki.<eos> I love you. Okay?<eos> And I don't care if you say it back.<eos> I do.

Him?<eos> I never said anything about a him.<eos> Where'd you find this guy anyway?<eos> Spraying cologne at the Beverly Center?<eos> Actually, he has a master's in child development, and he's the oldest of seven siblings, so he has plenty of experience.<eos> Yeah, well, I can see why you think he's perfect.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> I just want what's best for our son.<eos> Who wants to meet the tickle monster?<eos> I do!
- It's beautiful.<eos> - Yeah, it is.<eos> - Well, you guys should start getting ready.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Hello!<eos> Only the biggest party of the year!<eos> We co-host with the Alpha Rhos.<eos> - No way!<eos> They have, like, some of the hottest guys on campus.<eos> - Oh, they do indeed.
- Natalie Kellison; upon review of your testimony and the testimony of so many of your sorority sisters, it is the decision of this committee that you be reinstated immediately.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - What about Alexa?<eos> What happens to her?<eos> - Ms. Cooper has elected towithdraw her enrolment in the university.<eos> She'salsoresignedasthe presidentofDeltaPsi Beta.<eos> - ♪ We will watch your back ♪<eos> ♪ So you can start ♪ ♪ Walking again ♪<eos> - Compliments to the chef. Dinner looks amazing.<eos> - Yeah, it does.
It's all right.<eos> Make any headway with your missing girl?<eos> Uh, I've canvassed Pacoima,<eos> Santa Clarita, San Fernando, and Mission Hills.<eos> I've hung posters in bus stops, truck stops, and a community-college ride-share program.<eos> I have dogs in the national forest and birds over Pico Canyon.<eos> So, if by "making headway" you mean I've eliminated pretty much anywhere that a malnourished, penniless, scared-as-hell, illegal immigrant could go without anybody noticing her, then, yeah, I've made tremendous headway.<eos> Well, you know, pretty girl, desperate, middle of the night,<eos> - think somebody picked her up?<eos> - No, I don't.
Yeah, it looks good.<eos> - Oh, god.<eos> - You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's just overwhelming.<eos> It's a normal reaction.<eos> Your mom must be so excited. Uh...<eos> Actually, she doesn't know.<eos> Oh, and the father?<eos> Uh, he... He doesn't either.
I love it.<eos> Why don't you just stay?<eos> 'Cause this is getting me nervous.<eos> If you were here, it would be a lot easier.<eos> She loves you.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, that's why I'm leaving, 'cause I think you could use some nice father-daughter time.<eos> I gotta go to vegas and do this. What?<eos> You don't know what you're doing.<eos> Yes, I do.
I like homeschooling.<eos> I get my work done faster, and I don't have to worry about the other kids slowing me down.<eos> You don't have to worry about the other kids here, except that they're gonna want to be your friends.<eos> I don't need friends.<eos> I have hank.<eos> Okay, you have hank, honey.<eos> But you need other kids.<eos> You need friends that are your age, okay?<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Do you not own a cell phone?<eos> I do now.<eos> Oh, no, you don't!<eos> This phone is my lifeline!<eos> My texts, my music, my contacts, my photos, my Twitter, my Pinterest, and my comprehensive notes dedicating my five-year plan!<eos> Back off, bitch!<eos> Hey, let your phone go!<eos> Thanks.<eos> I had it under control, Jenna.<eos> No, you didn't.
Schwah!<eos> Sch-what's that?<eos> It is your brand-new used car!<eos> - What?<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Wait, you bought me a car?<eos> Oh, here come the tears.<eos> Why would you buy me a car?<eos> I already have a car.<eos> Not anymore you don't!
Dad!<eos> It's me.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Cesco.<eos> He's me friend.<eos> He didn't believe me when I told him I had a dad.<eos> Can we come in?<eos> I brought you some milk.<eos> So how fast does it go?<eos> It don't.
What's happened?<eos> I've had enough, that's all.<eos> We're going to wait.<eos> We're going to wait, aren't we?<eos> If I am coming with you, I'd better tell me granny, otherwise she'll be worrying about where I am.<eos> Nah, I doubt it.<eos> No, she will.<eos> She doesn't love you, you know.<eos> She thinks you're a friggin' nuisance.<eos> No, she doesn't.
"Louie, you are "kind and so fun.<eos> "I love our time together.<eos> "But we just have now, "and then we don't have the rest of now.<eos> "Eternity beginning tomorrow.<eos> "I always remember you.<eos> I will miss you, I ..."<eos> I...<eos> It's okay, it's okay. I, um...<eos> I wish I had one.<eos> I don't have-- I don't...
I've never seen such a miserable bunch!<eos> What are you - children?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You think you're funny, Fleming?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> All right, me too.<eos> Dismissed!<eos> What you doing, Fleming?<eos> So, Mr Pink, did you have a good weekend?<eos> Yeah, I did, thanks.
I...don't know.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> Er, hey, no offence, but I've got plans.<eos> I need you.<eos> Right!<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Into darkness.<eos> Doc...tor!<eos> How do you know who I am?<eos> He doesn't.
Mm-hmm.<eos> Who's going first? Huh? (Belt snaps)<eos> Junior, you picked a bad day to wear shorts.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> All of you are getting an ass-whupping if Jack isn't in my room in five minutes.<eos> Guys, that's like 300 mississippis.<eos> We better go.<eos> A quadruple ass-whupping?<eos> I don't think you have the cardio stamina for that.<eos> - Oh, I don't. - Oh.
[Chuckles] Thanks, dad.<eos> Dad, I finally got the coffee order right!<eos> Aah! Great job on the glass, Zoe!<eos> Yeah! So hot! Why?<eos> So, my "gift of hunger" experiment was a success, even if it had a few unintended consequences.<eos> Dre:<eos> Oh! I can't find Janine anywhere.<eos> Are the Greensteins on vacation?<eos> I need her to see me like this.<eos> - No, you don't.
Why didn't anyone else show up?<eos> Maybe they don't respect you like I do.<eos> I guess not.<eos> Seems like the only thing left to do is have some ice cream.<eos> Hold on to that thought.<eos> Ah. - Hey, what's going on?<eos> - Hey, Dre.<eos> Sorry to bother you at home, but I thought it was better than sending out one of those crappy team e-mails. - Cool.<eos> I don't read those, anyway.<eos> - No one does.
Why do you smell like turkey?<eos> Oh, I had a brining accident.<eos> No! Come back!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Mom-fail.<eos> Worldstar!<eos> God.<eos> Why were you even making a turkey?<eos> For Christmas Eve dinner.<eos> Babe, my mom does Christmas Eve.
Yeah!<eos> Yeah! All right, then it's time for some presents!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I said, "it's time for some presents!"<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah! Did I forget to tell you that Santa's in charge of the toy drive?<eos> Um... Yes, you did. Oh, wow.
Are you not listening to me?<eos> - Sorry, I'll be right back. - (Beeps)<eos> - Ben?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I think you just need to move on.<eos> Move on?<eos> I was just starting to move in.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I heard. Danny, she thinks all I care about is sex.<eos> - And you don't?
I could have been a John Doe, right?<eos> Like... if I had been murdered before you guys found me?<eos> It is possible.<eos> We had a picture of you on file, and you'd been through D.C.F.S, but, yes, there was no missing-persons investigation open on you when you became a witness.<eos> What if my mom comes back again? Mm. How would that work with this whole adoption thing?<eos> There are a lot of children with more than one mother these days.<eos> And would I have to go by "Rusty Raydor"?<eos> Because that... is a terrible name.<eos> It makes me sound like a cartoon character or something.<eos> It does a little bit.
Don, can you be impartial?<eos> What do I hold out for?<eos> Don't negotiate, just accept the deal.<eos> Should we take it from the top?<eos> "Welcome, welcome.<eos> Indiana's beautiful this time of year."<eos> I tell a joke, everyone laughs.<eos> Then Harry gets up and doesn't squander the good will I've just generated.<eos> - I have a joke, too.<eos> - No, you don't.
Just don't use the stove again.<eos> I don't wanna go to Newark. Nobody does.<eos> My uncle has a house and he got my mom a job.<eos> I don't wanna leave!<eos> You're moving?<eos> Well... well, that's okay.<eos> Maybe you'll have a yard.<eos> You want your mom to have a job, don't you?<eos> She don't care about me.<eos> Yes, she does.
If I sign a contract for five years, that'll be the rest of my life.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> You're not just pathetic, you're selfish.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, Roger.<eos> You may have the votes, but you don't have a deal.<eos> Now can we dispense with this nonsense, go outside and say a fond farewell?<eos> Ted... what if I told you you could just write copy and fight clients and not worry about partnership votes or stock prices?<eos> You could just go back to creative.<eos> I have that right now, and I'm miserable.<eos> No, you don't.
- A lot. Heh, heh.<eos> Mom came home at 2 a.m. last night.<eos> Yes?<eos> You know anything?<eos> Boss, I don't want to do this.<eos> You don't get to tell me what you want.<eos> Do you know anything or not?<eos> Boss-- You wanna keep your job?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I can't name my source.<eos> That's a fucking lie.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> If she went into witness protection, she was gonna send me a postcard. She never did.<eos> No, missy, she's dead.<eos> Asking if you were all in, that was wrong.<eos> You think so?<eos> I do.<eos> I think it's sexy.<eos> No, you don't.

He won't do it, we'll get someone else.<eos> No one will fucking touch it now.<eos> You went to his house.<eos> What would I have seen if I had taken pictures of you, Ray?<eos> How many fucking women would there be?<eos> I need you to sign these papers.<eos> What are they?<eos> Loan papers for the new house.<eos> I don't want it anymore.<eos> Yes, you do.
But I looks forward to the next day starting.<eos> I even like sleeping, cos I likes dreaming.<eos> Cos, um, my dreams are just as good as my real life.<eos> They're sort of the same, really.<eos> I basically dreams about what's happened that day, except I can fly sometimes, and animals talks to me.<eos> Animals what I've helped.<eos> Cos they can't say thank you in real life but they says thank you in my dreams.<eos> Cos I think that's what they would say if they could.<eos> I sometime knows I'm dreaming, d'you know what I mean?<eos> I do that.
That's what they want, they want the four of you.<eos> No, Dad, they want all the generations.<eos> Why are you being so modest? Yes!<eos> HUBBUB<eos> I look like shit!<eos> You really don't.<eos> Come on.<eos> I don't want my fucking photo taken!<eos> All right? !<eos> I just don't.
I smoke a bit of weed.<eos> It just helps.<eos> It helps take the edge off.<eos> Nothing terrible.<eos> Obviously I'm not some strung-out junkie.<eos> But it helps.<eos> And that's why I blanked you.<eos> Because I didn't want anyone in that place to know that you know me.<eos> Does Mum know?<eos> No. She doesn't.
[Sniffles] First thing I had to do was order the parts for the liquid-nitrogen device.<eos> And make it look like Carter Humphries did.<eos> The P.O. box was Dr. Jennings' idea...<eos> A final "screw you" for sleeping with his wife.<eos> The parts came, he built the device, and we planted it in the vents.<eos> Jennings took that test every morning when you went out for scones.<eos> That way, if you had a change of heart while it was happening, you couldn't stop it.<eos> [Voice breaking]: Every day got a little more stressful, especially when his symptoms started to show.<eos> We... we both knew it was coming.<eos> And then... it did.
I can't believe it. Cris!<eos> If you can make this happen pretending to be a lawyer... imagine what you could do if you became a real one.<eos> We need to make sure you do.<eos> Right, Felix?<eos> Felix!<eos> Sometimes it's... Not so bad having you around.<eos> Just so you know, what I heard was, "I love you." Aah! Well, if he's choking, you're doing that wrong.<eos> No, Ama, that was a hug.<eos> "Another thing we didn't have in our village."<eos> We didn't.
- Yes, you could!<eos> No more talk of alternate universes and magical wormholes.<eos> THAT will help.<eos> He needs food and rest, not decoration for his room.<eos> - My mother give this to me.<eos> I put it up.<eos> - It's a silly superstition.<eos> It will protect from the evil spirits.<eos> I don't need protecting, Nainai.<eos> - Ow! - Yes, you do, you silly boy.
- What - more than you?<eos> - More than any of us.<eos> How did you do it - hover that water bomb?<eos> You tell me.<eos> - Got 'em.<eos> - Good!<eos> This should be enough water for a tracking spell.<eos> 'Should'?<eos> I thought you said you knew what to do.<eos> I do... kind of.
Jake, I'll give you the grand tour.<eos> No, you better give your shoes a spritz.<eos> You've got half of Bremin on them.<eos> Wow, this smells fantastic.<eos> Yeah, I backpacked through Italy after uni and came across this recipe in a little village there.<eos> Of course, I've refined it over time.<eos> - Added my own little twist.<eos> - You knew I love Italian.<eos> - Did I?<eos> - Yes, you did.
You do it.<eos> [Chuckling] Oh, yeah.<eos> You're Myrna, okay?<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Your husband gets arrested. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Then later on, his buddy Lee comes over, looking for bail money.<eos> Right, and I think if Geno's so smart to save some bail money, well, then he's got to have some money hidden somewhere in this house.<eos> And you want it.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
- Then, you have to do it now.<eos> Hello.<eos> Zbigniew Religa.<eos> Are you familiar with transplantation medicine?<eos> Kidney transplants?<eos> My son doesn't need no kidneys.<eos> But I need your son's heart.<eos> I do not give my consent.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.
Gotcha!<eos> I'm serious, Gabi.<eos> You're smart, you're funny, you're beautiful... (Laughs nervously) What?<eos> Look, I didn't mean for this to happen.<eos> Uh, mean for what to happen?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Well, this whole thing started because of Cheryl.<eos> When I'm with you, I don't even think about her.<eos> I don't know how to say this, but...<eos> Uh, then don't.
I just wanted to see you smile again, baby.<eos> I paid a lot for those teeth.<eos> So, are you okay with me calling Cheryl?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I had to.<eos> It's true love.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> But it doesn't mean that I don't love you.<eos> I would be lucky to have someone like you in my family.<eos> You already do.
We got nothing.<eos> They literally burned everything.<eos> And we have pictures of burning drugs and buses.<eos> We can sell this as a major takedown, our major takedown.<eos> So we just keep smiling and climbing, huh?<eos> Come back to D.C. with me.<eos> We can take a victory lap.<eos> Somebody in law enforcement tipped off Solano.<eos> - Okay, you don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Wrap this around his face.<eos> Hold it tight at the back of his head.<eos> Oh, please don't do this. No! No, no.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> How long do you want to do this, huh, Lawrence?<eos> - Again.<eos> - Briggs.<eos> - No!<eos> - He knows.<eos> - What if he doesn't?
Uh, [Clears throat] I'm a friend.<eos> Oh. Um, yeah, I just really need to talk to her.<eos> You know, I feel really bad.<eos> Came here earlier to let her know that her husband had passed away, and, ah, I screwed it up.<eos> Who died?<eos> Her husband, uh, down at the pawn shop.<eos> I'm... I'm... I'm really sorry if you were close.<eos> No, he didn't die.<eos> No, no.<eos> He did.
No.<eos> That's you.<eos> I suppose it's the same reason you ended up with him.<eos> Yeah, something like that.<eos> Uh, this could be an eight-hour day.<eos> What is the deal with this eight-hour-day thing?<eos> Just tired of breaking promises.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had it under control.<eos> - No, you didn't.

You gonna write me up?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> Depends.<eos> - On what? - [Seat belt clicks]<eos> How much you annoy me on the drive home.<eos> Why did... why did you come, then?<eos> A cop showed up at my door at midnight, and I thought you were gonna die.<eos> Well... here I am.<eos> I didn't.
- [Sniffles] Yeah.<eos> - Okay, good. Good.<eos> We still have quite a bit of time.<eos> I like to budget like half an hour to get across town, you know, just in case something comes up... construction, traffic.<eos> - [Horn honks] - You never know.<eos> Right, yeah, no, it's good to, um, - be able to take our time. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Uh, Sam's gonna miss having you.<eos> Will he?<eos> [Scoffs] I mean, you never know with that guy, right?<eos> - Do you?
AL: I thought it was longer.<eos> AL: Our victim was Scott Standley,<eos> Zoning Board Commissioner.<eos> No sign of forced entry...<eos> Interesting.<eos> Okay, listen, I just saw a guy who used a pocket watch to gain access to the back room.<eos> Now Standley had the exact same watch in his apartment.<eos> He wasn't coming here to drink.<eos> You think there's a casino in there?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Jim, you seem like a nice guy, but this is not a city or a job for nice guys.<eos> You understand?<eos> No.<eos> And that's your problem.<eos> You're a cynic.<eos> A slovenly, lackadaisical cynic.<eos> You're probably right.<eos> Okay, soldier boy, let's go roust some muggers.<eos> "Lackadaisical"? Hmm.<eos> How you doing?
Of course not.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So... talk to me.<eos> We're getting nowhere on the Wayne case.<eos> I made a promise to Bruce Wayne and I can't deliver.<eos> But you will.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe I'm out of my depth.<eos> I very much doubt you're out of your depth, but even if you are, you know how to swim, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do.
And what did He even do?<eos> The "Back to the Future" movies, uh, He worked on those.<eos> Otherwise, He's been pretty much the same.<eos> I don't know if there is a God.<eos> That's all I think you can say, honestly.<eos> I mean, you could say there is a God if you believe in it.<eos> That's-- you could just get to say it 'cause you believe it.<eos> You can't argue with somebody's beliefs.<eos> "I believe in God."<eos> "No, you don't."
Louie is gonna provide the fuel.<eos> I will provide initial combustion.<eos> Don't worry, Louie, you're safe.<eos> Okay, Louie, bend over the desk.<eos> This may be my last day here.<eos> Okay, Louie.<eos> Ready? Mm-hmm.<eos> One, two, three, fart!<eos> I thought you said you had one.<eos> I do, I just...
Just think about it, just think about it.<eos> That's a kid!<eos> Thanks, Louie.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow for potatoes.<eos> Yes, sir, see you tomorrow.<eos> We were playing basketball in Mike's driveway... Mm-hmm. ... and I had to take a piss.<eos> So I go upstairs, and I'm walking by his parents bedroom.<eos> So the door is wide open and his mom is standing there with just a skirt on.<eos> I saw her tits.<eos> No you didn't.

Hey, mush, you got a problem?<eos> No.<eos> You want one?<eos> What?<eos> Hold on a sec.<eos> I think I'm gonna kick your ass.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Is that a good idea?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Oh, you don't?
It'll be like you'll be there, I'll be there with you being there.<eos> Like, together, we'll both be there.<eos> So I'll see you at the dance?<eos> Yeah, if you're going.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay...<eos> So, I, uh,<eos> I asked Laurie Sevetta to the dance.<eos> She said yes.<eos> No she didn't.

Hello...<eos> Is this the police?<eos> My son is missing<eos> Your name and address<eos> My name is Tian Wen-jun... I live in...<eos> Nanshan District 125A Baishizhou<eos> Missing for how long?<eos> Maybe...2 to 3 hours<eos> Did you look for him?<eos> I did not
Mr. Gao<eos> Mr. Gao<eos> Please ask him again<eos> Mr. Gao Mr. Gao<eos> Stop following me!<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You told me yesterday that you saw the baby<eos> You heard me wrong, I never said that<eos> Yes you did!
Please ask him again<eos> Mr. Gao Mr. Gao<eos> Stop following me!<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You told me yesterday that you saw the baby<eos> You heard me wrong, I never said that<eos> Yes you did!<eos> You said it on the stairs!<eos> I did not
- Hey!<eos> - I want to get out of here!<eos> - I'm gonna take that away from you unless you calm down.<eos> Calm down!<eos> Now, tell me what you want.<eos> - I want to get out of here.<eos> - OK, well, that's...<eos> That's up to the board to decide.<eos> I don't have any power over that.<eos> - If you did, your opinion...
Admit it, though.<eos> You've had work done.<eos> Bunion surgery.<eos> Thanks for noticing.<eos> [Laughing] Oh, God.<eos> You're still that same old kooky Val-gina.<eos> Val-gina?<eos> Erica started a rumor that I was a hermaphrodite.<eos> I need a hug.<eos> No, you don't.
You know, makes me feel like I'm back in high school.<eos> I thought high school kind of sucked for you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it did, maybe a skosh, but I got to tell you, now I love it.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Hey, I was afraid this party would be kind of lame, so I got a room.<eos> Yes.<eos> - You want to see it?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Do you, Allen Glade Steed, take sister, Elissa Wall Jessop... to be your wife, for time and all eternity?<eos> - This is the way.<eos> There is no other way.<eos> No name given under God.<eos> Do you, brother Allen...<eos> Elissa!<eos> I'm going to ask you once again.<eos> Do you, sister Elissa Wall Jessop... take brother Allen Glade Steed... to be your husband, for time and all eternity?<eos> I...<eos> I do.
God's plan isn't always easy to understand.<eos> I believe in you, Elissa.<eos> Always have.<eos> But the thing is... I need to know that you believe in me too.<eos> Your sister, Rebecca... she disappointed me.<eos> She's been disloyal.<eos> And disloyalty is something that I just can't tolerate.<eos> I have to put a stop to it.<eos> I do believe in you, Uncle Warren.<eos> I do.
That is badass.<eos> Yeah, it is badass.<eos> See, look at that-<eos> - What do you think of that, Louie?<eos> She likes badasses.<eos> Huh- - What do you think of that?<eos> So-so-So what'd I say?<eos> An ounce per scale, is that what it was?<eos> Actually, you said two ounces.<eos> Oh, I did, did I?
He couldn't have killed Lilian.<eos> I know, because he was with me.<eos> He was in bed with me.<eos> She told you, did she?<eos> Bless her.<eos> She thinks that'll give me an alibi.<eos> But we weren't together all night.<eos> Old Bill will still think I had opportunity.<eos> - Everyone believes you killed her.<eos> - Of course they do.
- What are you doing?<eos> - Is it subterfuge?<eos> Top-secret subterfuge.<eos> Keep your father busy, will you?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Geordie!<eos> Sorry. - William Calthorpe.<eos> - What about him?<eos> He lied.<eos> - Course he did.
You've killed.<eos> You were both soldiers.<eos> You both fought.<eos> It was your duty to take lives.<eos> And it is your duty to save them.<eos> My conscience is clear, Mr Chambers.<eos> I doubt even you could say that.<eos> He's a crackpot.<eos> Seems sane enough to me.<eos> The most insane often do.
So how do you two know each other?<eos> Hildegard plays the piano.<eos> I'm thinking of taking some lessons.<eos> What do you play?<eos> Any Mozart?<eos> Can't beat a bit of Mozart.<eos> Of course, he is one of my favourite composers.<eos> Plays the piano?<eos> Next you'll be telling me she actually likes jazz.<eos> - She does.
With men.<eos> Sexual liaisons.<eos> Marion...<eos> Marion, if you speak to us, it won't go any further.<eos> You have my word.<eos> Dominic loved me.<eos> He did what he wanted, with who he wanted, and you brought up his children.<eos> Geordie!<eos> - No, he loved me.<eos> - Of course he did.
Mrs. Hildegard Chambers, at your service.<eos> Anyone would think that you're jealous?<eos> - You're wanted.<eos> - So are you.<eos> Go on.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Did Dad ask after me?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - He hates me.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
They threw a party to humiliate girls.<eos> Oh. So what now, hmm?<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Do you even have a plan?<eos> Yeah, I'm not dropping out of school or anything.<eos> But it felt like a time suck.<eos> And, you know, now I'm freed up to do all these other things.<eos> Like, last night I went to this vegetarian dinner 'cause I had nobody else to eat with, and it turns out I really like it.<eos> Vegetarian food?<eos> - You do?
I didn't seduce you in order to get you to re-administer a test to a former player of mine.<eos> That would be slightly insane.<eos> Slightly.<eos> For the record, I am capable of empathy.<eos> But my little brother... he's deaf and has loads of other medical issues.<eos> And I grew up watching my parents and all of his teachers baby him.<eos> And it didn't do him any favors.<eos> It wasn't until people stopped making excuses for him and forced him to truly try that he made any real progress.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Well, now you do.
Well, people never are.<eos> He said I was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen.<eos> You are.<eos> Look.<eos> That's him.<eos> He offered me a ride home.<eos> (school bell ringing)<eos> Muchacho, muchacho. You know what your dad does for a living?<eos> Huh? Do you know how he pays for everything in your life?<eos> - Do you?
But mostly that.<eos> That's good, Joe.<eos> Deep calming breaths.<eos> And I will remind you once again that Felicia holds all the cards here.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I hold some of the cards too.<eos> All right?<eos> Four-of-a-kind, and they're all me.<eos> So you feel no need to make any sense right now?<eos> No, I do not.
Everything clear?<eos> Clear.<eos> Not 'clear' but: 'Yes, sir! '<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> And put those shoes back in the wardrobe, you're not in the circus. Congrats!<eos> - These are lovely. His dad's.<eos> - First class!<eos> Enough!<eos> - Two rounds per person, I said!<eos> - No, you did not.
Where you going?<eos> Where you puttin' the hole?<eos> You can't do that.<eos> You can't change a hole right in the middle of your playing, can he?<eos> Well he just did.<eos> Stand there and watch him.<eos> Alrighty, got you a brand-new one right here, fellas.<eos> Well, we already hit though.<eos> You guys don't play by the rules?<eos> No, we do.
I fucking hate you.<eos> This is Handsome Jack Heartthrob, he's gonna be our corpse for the day.<eos> This is our hearse, and we're gonna ride around and...<eos> - Car.<eos> - Car.<eos> This is the second funeral bit you've done with us.<eos> On the TV show, he...<eos> On the TV show, Jack was playing her pad and falling out of the back of the hearse.<eos> Wait, wait, how do we know this thing's not gonna flip over, though?<eos> - We don't.
Well, you looked hungry.<eos> I appreciate your concern.<eos> Rebecca: Guests first.<eos> Ruth: I'll serve them, Paulina.<eos> Is there anything you won't eat?<eos> I hate tongue.<eos> There isn't any.<eos> They say you run the Corner Hotel.<eos> No, I just work there.<eos> Did work there for the summer.
It's in Trenton.<eos> Whose house is that?<eos> Nobody's house.<eos> Is it a school?<eos> Is it an orphanage?<eos> My name is in that book.<eos> If you take it, you're stealing from me and you're certainly no gentleman.<eos> I need you to pull all the prostitution cases north of 110th Street.<eos> You need me to?<eos> Mr. Hodge does.
I want Claudie back.<eos> Mr Johnson.<eos> You're not welcome here.<eos> ~ I want to say goodbye.<eos> ~ You're not welcome here!<eos> ~ Let him see her, Dad.<eos> ~ Or what?<eos> Or what?<eos> ~ I don't wanna do this.<eos> ~ Yes, you do!
~ I didn't mean to hurt you.<eos> I know you didn't.<eos> I can make them understand.<eos> Your friend, he wasn't supposed to be there.<eos> I was just... ~ I-I know.<eos> ~ You must hate me.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> I don't hate you!<eos> You have a choice, Robert.<eos> We all do.
But more than that, why wasn't there any scratch marks on Malcolm's body?<eos> That's something I hadn't thought about.<eos> - That's very interesting.<eos> Who's to say that the scratches didn't heal before he was arrested?<eos> It was 10 days after the kidnapping.<eos> True, but for the fact that it would take typically two weeks for an ordinary scratch to heal.<eos> But in this circumstance, well, it would take much longer.<eos> So, doc, in your expert opinion, by the time they arrested Malcolm, he should still have marks on him if he had been scratched?<eos> Yes.<eos> But he didn't.
Yeah.<eos> I need you to come to the Expo.<eos> Ashley...<eos> This isn't a joke, Ray.<eos> This is not for me... it's for a friend.<eos> He needs your help.<eos> He'll pay you whatever you want.<eos> What is it, Pie?<eos> I thought you didn't want to hear anything I've got to say.<eos> I don't.
Got it.<eos> And what if they can't crack it?<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> This guy, John Paul, does he have any idea when Jane's supposed to arrive in the U.S.?<eos> No.<eos> And Nemec won't risk getting in touch with him.<eos> Jane said he was only given a window of arrival, not a specific date.<eos> So, as far as he knows, Jane's already here.<eos> Does he know what Jane looks like?<eos> No. He doesn't.
It was mana something?<eos> Manakish.<eos> Oh. Yeah, it's like a little pizza. Oh.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Did something happen between you and Erica Flynn?<eos> Why?<eos> She made a point of letting me know that it did, so did it? Uh... Well, um...<eos> Actually, yes.<eos> Something did.
Bye.<eos> What's your plan?<eos> Uh, the key is probably in one of the books in Nemec's apartment.<eos> I just need to figure out which one.<eos> Well, how are we gonna get into the apartment?<eos> Taxi!<eos> Don't tell me you're calling her.<eos> I am.<eos> We don't need her help.<eos> Yes, we do.

Uh, I'll tell you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> What's your plan?<eos> Uh, the key is probably in one of the books in Nemec's apartment.<eos> I just need to figure out which one.<eos> Well, how are we gonna get into the apartment?<eos> Taxi!<eos> Don't tell me you're calling her.<eos> I am. We don't need her help.<eos> Yes, we do.
You can't have three halves.<eos> Maybe daddy could pay half, too.<eos> You're going in the wrong direction.<eos> Piggy banks!<eos> Now.<eos> Go, go, go, go, go, go.<eos> Thank you so much for staying late tonight.<eos> - I quit.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, no, you don't.
Maybe daddy could pay half, too.<eos> You're going in the wrong direction.<eos> Piggy banks!<eos> Now.<eos> Go, go, go, go, go, go.<eos> Thank you so much for staying late tonight.<eos> - I quit.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, no, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- Dr. Henry Morgan?<eos> - Speaking.<eos> Dr. Morgan, I have to say, talking to you is probably the most exciting thing that's ever happened in my life.<eos> Well, that's nice.<eos> For most people, it's not even the high point of their day.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> If they knew more about you, their opinion would change.<eos> Dr. Morgan, how did you survive that subway crash?<eos> I don't understand what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Don't worry.<eos> We're gonna learn more about this guy.<eos> Henry!<eos> Abigail, I'm sorry.<eos> Because it won't work.<eos> Because it can't.<eos> I've read your letter.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
What is it?<eos> This room is filled with Degas, Monet, all masterpieces.<eos> And one painting by an unknown Argentinean.<eos> Ah, the Vermeers.<eos> Abigail, this is Gloria.<eos> It's her party.<eos> I think you have someone special here, Abigail.<eos> I think you're right.<eos> Do you have someone special?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
This.<eos> A painting by an unknown artist.<eos> In the 1950s,<eos> Fernando Costa was a young painter on the rise...<eos> Promising, but hardly worthy of this museum.<eos> Only one person could make this happen.<eos> Gloria Carlyle.<eos> And she was in love with him.<eos> Do you have someone special?<eos> Yes, I do.
But he was wrong.<eos> She never forgave him.<eos> And I never forgave her.<eos> She donated millions of dollars to secretly keep this painting on display...<eos> And one day die in front of it.<eos> I hope she saw it.<eos> Good work back there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I know it's hard to go someplace with old memories.<eos> You do?
Fire when ready.<eos> Refugees are blocking my shot.<eos> NS-Two, do you have a clean shot to the Tango, over?<eos> Give me a sec.<eos> Go two up.<eos> This is a senior Taliban.<eos> If you have a clean shot, send the mail now.<eos> Roger that, over.<eos> Put some lead on this guy, Reese.<eos> Do it now!
What would he sing?<eos> You know, stupid songs.<eos> Songs he made up.<eos> Sometimes really old songs.<eos> And then, when he ran out of those, he'd just... sing like animals.<eos> Like whales and raccoons... wolves.<eos> He was a funny guy.<eos> Sing me one.<eos> You don't want to hear me sing.<eos> Yes, I do.
We tracked him to a ditch.<eos> A few more feet.<eos> Here.<eos> What now?<eos> I don't think he'd turn around and go home, but I don't know where else he'd hole up.<eos> What is it?<eos> I ran the VIN number on Sparks' ISEA vehicle, but he owns a personal vehicle as well.<eos> Well, wouldn't he just kill the transponder on that one, too.<eos> He doesn't have it.<eos> His ex-wife does.
Hit-and-run.<eos> They had to cut you out of the wreck.<eos> You were in the hospital three weeks, in a coma.<eos> And when you woke up You didn't remember much.<eos> Not even me.<eos> When was it?<eos> February 2004.<eos> They ever find the driver?<eos> No.<eos> They didn't.
Loses touch with reality, and ends up dead.<eos> Well, his murder definitely wasn't an accident.<eos> Neither is martin's involvement.<eos> You're taking some big leaps.<eos> Are you sure the fact that you two had a relationship isn't Clouding your objectivity?<eos> Who said we had a relationship?<eos> I am good at my job.<eos> That's who said.<eos> Not that good, tony.<eos> 'Cause I don't do relationships.
- Thank you.<eos> Korsak is sending patrol units to search around the hospital.<eos> - I spooked her.<eos> - No, you were trying to help.<eos> Same result.<eos> Look, there are a lot of people looking for her.<eos> She won't get far.<eos> Should we go back to your room? No.<eos> And... and... and you got to get back to work.<eos> - No, I-I-I don't.
This is usually when Jane says, "get to the point"<eos> before she's overcome with an urge to strangle me<eos> - with her bare hands.<eos> - I miss her.<eos> The chemist found, uh, substantial amounts of acetone, as well as traces of other chemicals that he discounted as burn-off.<eos> Meaning the stuff left behind from everything<eos> - that melted in the fire?<eos> - Yes. And one of those discounted chemicals was toluene, a solvent.<eos> But it would only have been present as a burn-off if the Sullivans had hardwood floors.<eos> - Which they didn't.
The D.A. filed a motion to overturn the verdict.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> That means in two days, your father will be a free man.<eos> Okay.<eos> [glasses clink] Cheers.<eos> So, is my mother boycotting my big send-off?<eos> No, she actually went out dancing.<eos> But she sends her love.<eos> I'm sorry. Did you say she went dancing?<eos> - I did.
Oi, back here, love.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Just a heads up.<eos> Dors caught me doing a... Oh, fuck.<eos> I know what you're up to.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What?<eos> You're using the garden project as a way of smuggling stuff in.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, Dors.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Did you see a red door at the playground?<eos> Didn't notice.<eos> So, if this door does lead to Chester's Mill, it could be a way for me to get Junior and bring him back here.<eos> Are you gonna bring Jim back, too?<eos> Let's go to the playground and see if there's a red door there.<eos> Where you been, James?<eos> Just... making rounds.<eos> See all that activity outside the dome?<eos> Fellas in black?<eos> Yeah, I did.
See all that activity outside the dome?<eos> Fellas in black?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> I saw someone else, too, last night on the other side.<eos> Who?<eos> Barbie.<eos> He's alive.<eos> Did you know?<eos> Yeah, Dad.<eos> I did.
No, I'm sorry. These drawings have led<eos> - to some pretty awful stuff. - But it doesn't change the fact that my sister's drawings have always been right.<eos> We won't have to go far.<eos> An image search found possibilities in town.<eos> I've got all the red doors here in Zenith.<eos> Personally, I'm thinking the storage space, but if we're really digging into the space-time of it all, the colonial's got that whole Narnia spin.<eos> You said that you saw this in a vision?<eos> They always mean something. I think that door is the way back into the dome.<eos> Hunter, we need addresses.<eos> No, you don't.
These right here, airlines and corresponding plane numbers.<eos> International airlines.<eos> So whatever they're transporting is going in and out of the country.<eos> We haven't figured out what these numbers mean yet, but we think it has something to do with where the shipment ends up.<eos> If everything is chosen at random...<eos> No one knows who's flying or where until the algorithm chooses.<eos> Cloaked in this kind of secrecy, it must be a very high value target.<eos> And without planning, it's almost an impossible heist.<eos> Unless you have the algorithm.<eos> Of which, thanks to Neal and Keller, the Pink Panthers do.
Eyewitness testimonies.<eos> Mm. Oh, looks serious.<eos> Extremely.<eos> I've narrowed it down to these five.<eos> Why are they all in white coats?<eos> They're obstetricians.<eos> From what I've uncovered, the finest in New York.<eos> You should be safe with any of them.<eos> Honey, you do know that I already have an OB-GYN, right?<eos> - You do? - Mm-hmm.
Which is why I'm not looking to advertise the fact that I once had an affair.<eos> You're not advertising it.<eos> You're disclosing it to counsel.<eos> Okay, look, you want the truth?<eos> I'm not proud of the way I was back then.<eos> The way I treated Allison, the way I treated you.<eos> But I'm not that person anymore, and I don't want people to think that I am.<eos> And I understand that, but I work for Harvey, and I can't keep things from him that he needs to know.<eos> - He doesn't need to know this.<eos> - Yes, he does.
$30 million.<eos> And you turned it down?<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> They're gonna rip the company apart.<eos> I don't care if they wanna use Walter Gillis' head as a paperweight.<eos> You said you wanted a grand slam.<eos> That offer is a double.<eos> Well, I'd rather have a double than nothing.<eos> Look, I know what I am doing here.<eos> Do you?
So what's going on with Mike Ross?<eos> How do you know I'm thinking about Mike Ross?<eos> Who else would it be?<eos> He got you on the ropes?<eos> No, I got him.<eos> And he's about to go down.<eos> How do you know?<eos> 'Cause the only way to stay in the game is to get Walter Gillis to give up his dream.<eos> And you don't think he has the stomach to rip off the arm to save the body.<eos> No, he doesn't.

So, there's some forms to fill in and I need to ask you a few questions.<eos> ~ Age?<eos> ~ 80-odd, I told you!<eos> 80-something.<eos> Can't remember the last time anyone asked me.<eos> ~ Who's your GP, Tom?<eos> ~ Those bastards?<eos> ~ They'll kill you, soon as look at you!<eos> ~ You must have a GP.<eos> Maybe I did, once.
Oh, that is a box that once contained a pregnancy test.<eos> Mm-hmm, no, I get that.<eos> But hey, we use...<eos> We use condoms every time, right?<eos> You are correct, sir.<eos> - Are you doing sex math?<eos> - I am.<eos> So you... you're sleeping with other people, or it's just you and me, and you thought you were pregnant with my... whoa, okay.<eos> No, but yes, in that you are not the only you, you know.<eos> I do, I do.
Well, he was wrong, wasn't he?<eos> Wasn't he? Danny, what do you think?<eos> I think I've seen this look before.<eos> No, you haven't.<eos> This is new for me.<eos> No, not on your face... on mine.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - I left the army.<eos> You loved the army. Yep.<eos> And then one day I didn't.
Not Mikael, your real father.<eos> Is that your best shot?<eos> You're gonna have to do a lot better than that if you're gonna kill a hybrid.<eos> Stop.<eos> Jackson.<eos> Hayley.<eos> I see you met my friend Ansel.<eos> You know her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Actually, I do.
Kol Mikaelson, and if you want to take down Klaus without your friends dying, well, then you'd be a fool not to listen to me. Uh! Ooh...<eos> That's mother dearest calling me home.<eos> Well, you always did know how to leave a message, mother.<eos> If only all my sons were as respectful as you are.<eos> Kol will return home soon.<eos> Elijah will wake from his slumber believing the only way to salvage his humanity is to rejoin our family, which is why it is time you bring Camile in.<eos> Here.<eos> I've spelled this to subdue her without causing bodily harm.<eos> I thought we had more time.<eos> We don't.
You know, I was up all night looking through this, trying to find something, anything that will help me figure out how to get the people back together.<eos> Let me guess... no such luck.<eos> Nothing viable.<eos> And now Ansel's dead along with Ollie, so forgive me if I need a beer because right now, I can use all the help I can get.<eos> I screwed up, you guys.<eos> I was with Kaleb last night, and he took the white oak stake when I was asleep.<eos> I... I'm sorry.<eos> I never should have trusted him.<eos> Kol doesn't have the stake.<eos> Klaus does.
You know, um, I slept with Angelo the first day I met him.<eos> But then again, who didn't?<eos> That's the first time I've laughed since...<eos> You're allowed.<eos> Thank you for this.<eos> I really needed it.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Daphne hates me.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Dude, moms love me.<eos> Carrie...<eos> I'm not introducing you to my moms... until I know this is definitely something real.<eos> Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't realize that you were fucking... a pretend vagina every night.<eos> They're my moms.<eos> - lt's a big step.<eos> - I'm ready for that.<eos> Wow, okay. Uh, do they even know I exist?<eos> Yeah, of course they do.
They know all about you.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Hey. - Hey. - Can you put this in the back room?<eos> I don't feel like answering any questions about Kevin's wedding.<eos> Yeah, can I, uh, take a look?<eos> Sure.<eos> Wow.<eos> Jesus, that's some O'Hara shit.<eos> Yeah, I have to keep the tag on so I can return it afterwards.<eos> No, don't do that.
Why does this have to happen?<eos> Can't escape nature.<eos> Yeah, but why stay?<eos> They had plenty of warnings.<eos> They think they can ride out the storm.<eos> ...a combination of inadequate resources, stagnant water, and unsafe sanitary conditions will only make the health crisis...<eos> How did Jackie almost kill a patient?<eos> She entered the wrong insulin dosage.<eos> - We all make mistakes.<eos> - We do, Jackie doesn't.
Hey!<eos> Sorry again, Emma.<eos> It's OK, thanks.<eos> Now I know where to find the foot bath!<eos> Adam told me you had a lovely sense of humour.<eos> Did I?<eos> What else has he told you?<eos> Likes it from behind.<eos> Um, and you have a sister?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Galan's people finally rotated the codes, I guess.<eos> Truth is, we were lucky to stay up on it for as long as we did.<eos> All right. Call Tony.<eos> Loop him in.<eos> I'll update the director.<eos> Nicaragua.<eos> Looks like they found what they were digging for.<eos> Which is? Why don't you tell me?<eos> You knew from the beginning that's why Galan wanted that field.<eos> No, I did not.
His brother got paroled against 50 to 1 odds.<eos> Who can pull those strings?<eos> Who has that kind of power?<eos> Why don't you tell me?<eos> Tony.<eos> Don't you have a team meeting?<eos> So that guy you sent me to,<eos> Haik Katoyan, he's dead.<eos> Guess you already knew that, right?<eos> Yes, I did.
I don't wanna start any...<eos> I brought new photos.<eos> He let you cut his hair.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Everyone says he looks like you now.<eos> He still won't come with you?<eos> Uh, it's just hard for him.<eos> The kids at school have been...<eos> Honey, Luke loves you so much.<eos> He does.
With bare feet.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Check in between his toes.<eos> Looks like an injection site.<eos> With the right drug, you can stop the heart.<eos> No one's the wiser.<eos> Staged as a suicide, case closed.<eos> Most autopsies will miss it.<eos> You mind if I ask you how you know that?<eos> Just do.
Big deal.<eos> Ah, I just wanted to talk to you about an opportunity... yeah, I heard you talking to my mom, and I'm not interested.<eos> Well, you're gonna be interested!<eos> You're an airbender now, and you have a responsibility as a citizen of the world. Whatever.<eos> I didn't ask to become an airbender, you know.<eos> Well, I didn't ask to be the Avatar, but I am, and I'm fulfilling my duties. So?<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Yes, I do have to.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
What are you going to do, officer, arrest me?<eos> Don't even think about taking one more step!<eos> Good afternoon. Where are you off to today?<eos> I, uh, got a delivery to make in Bao Yu.<eos> I should be back later today.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, just a little tired.<eos> One more pickup, then I'm clocking out.<eos> I thought you said you had a delivery.<eos> Did I?
We take care of our wards... and they revere the Khan as their father.<eos> Today, they honor us by working tirelessly to prepare for the White Moon festivities.<eos> Something wrong, Blue Princess?<eos> I was merely observing the peasants' devotion, their love for their royal benefactress.<eos> Do you question their devotion and their love?<eos> I do not.<eos> Stop.<eos> Does Lady Kokachin wish to speak on the topic of the common people?<eos> I apologize, Empress, for speaking when not bid to do so.<eos> Do so... now.
What is this?<eos> Ali, no.<eos> Don't, don't look at that.<eos> Maybe I should leave.<eos> It was stupid to think I could get a new life by just coming back from the dead.<eos> Is that what your text was about?<eos> You're thinking about not staying here?<eos> No.<eos> We got the tox screen back from the coroner.<eos> You did?
And when we get sick of that, we'll play chess.<eos> How's it going in there?<eos> Did you find anything that works?<eos> No.<eos> No, nothing... nothing worked.<eos> Hey, I got your message about the recording.<eos> Can I come over?<eos> I'm confused.<eos> I was with Ali and she didn't even mention this.<eos> She didn't?
Auggie.<eos> You mind telling me which side the graffiti's on?<eos> I hate standing on the wrong side of the Cold War.<eos> I just heard.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They want you to be a good soldier until you die or are no longer of use to them, and then they put you behind a desk.<eos> Come on in.<eos> The water's fine.<eos> - Doesn't it bother you?<eos> - It did.
There's even a line of Ruke Teddy Bears.<eos> - Layna.<eos> - Layna.<eos> All right.<eos> Layna it will be. Everybody got that?<eos> Yeah, you know what?<eos> Since we're all together, let's, uh, put a pin in the marketing talk and discuss the wedding.<eos> We've been trying to figure it out on our own, but both of us keep adding tour dates.<eos> We don't have to talk about that right this second.<eos> Oh, yeah, we kind of do.
I'm surprised you even wanted to come.<eos> Research.<eos> Jeanie gave me a mandate.<eos> She wants me to write something fun, and I don't know if I'm the writer-for-hire type.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You and Gunnar did pretty well when you worked together.<eos> Ever think about partnering up again?<eos> Not really, no.<eos> I can't believe your dad let you come to this.<eos> He didn't.
- What do you want me to do?<eos> - Uh, this is, uh, just fine.<eos> Tell me how she did it.<eos> - Who?<eos> - The most beautiful girl in the world...<eos> Juliette Barnes. Did she do it like this, hmm? - No.<eos> Don't... don't do that.<eos> You don't like it?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Uh, I-I-I do.
And I know that seems like a long time, but you know what?<eos> When this is done, I'll be back home, probably working on a new album, working on the label.<eos> Things will be back to normal.<eos> Okay, mom.<eos> Go for it.<eos> Thank you, baby.<eos> Except the fact that you'll be married to Luke.<eos> That part won't be normal.<eos> Want to talk about that some more?<eos> No. I don't.
Okay?<eos> Let's just be really clear about that.<eos> I do not forgive you.<eos> [sniffles] And I am not gonna let you get in the way of what I want.<eos> Come on, babe.<eos> Don't forget to smile for the cameras.<eos> [Juliette grunts, coughs] What are you doing?<eos> I was just dropping your stuff off.<eos> Didn't think you'd want to see me, so...<eos> I don't.
I saw an opportunity, and I took it.<eos> But this is a business meeting.<eos> That's all.<eos> Okay, what business could you possibly have with me?<eos> I wasn't kidding.<eos> Edgehill really does want to get involved in music education.<eos> You saw what I did with your daughter's school.<eos> I want to do that in every school. Wow.<eos> You must have a real image problem if that's your play.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Bottom line... this is inappropriate.<eos> So, I'm just supposed to stop liking him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Why, because you're afraid of what other people might think?<eos> No, Maddie.<eos> I am trying to protect you.<eos> Do you remember how you felt when you saw that magazine article?<eos> Remember... and the way it depicted you?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Hey.<eos> Yeah, this isn't a good idea.<eos> Are you drunk?<eos> Everyone's drunk, which means no one's paying attention to us.<eos> - No.<eos> No, this...<eos> - So you don't have to be so paranoid.<eos> This isn't a good idea, no matter what state everyone's in, all right?<eos> I thought we had a good thing the other night.<eos> We did.
You excuse me one second?<eos> It's going all right out here.<eos> What's new at home?<eos> Um... ooh. Check this out.<eos> Brand... new pedal board. Nice!<eos> What else?<eos> Well, you remember my old friend Kiley, right?<eos> She's leaving town and wants to catch up before she goes.<eos> But look, if that bothers you, I don't have to see her.<eos> It... it doesn't.
But nobody here knows about that.<eos> At least, they didn't till you shot off your big mouth about it.<eos> And is it mine?<eos> You know, you've already made your big scene.<eos> I'm not gonna let you stand here now and insult her by... no, I mean, she's sure it's not Jeff's?<eos> What?<eos> Look, look, all I know is that she says it's yours, and I believe her, okay?<eos> You know what the sad thing is?<eos> I used to think you were a really great influence on her.<eos> I really did.
Well, I don't know what you can do about the broken-up part, but I reckon if you wanted to find work, you could.<eos> Yeah, there's actually a tour in L.A. That my friend Mavis could get me on, but...<eos> I know you don't want to sing backup anymore, but... It's better than sleeping on Deacon's couch.<eos> Hey, maybe you could manage me, too.<eos> I'm not really managing Terry.<eos> I mean, he had a whole career before I came along.<eos> I'm just helping him.<eos> You're just helping him get gigs, get press...<eos> Did I tell you that people from a television show want to interview him?<eos> Well, of course they do.
I missed you!<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> I miss you, too.<eos> I didn't know you were gonna be here.<eos> Well, uh, he's been dying to see the band play, and I arranged a playdate for him with a little buddy of his while we have our meeting.<eos> Can I get some lemonade, too?<eos> Uh, yeah, sure, buddy.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, you think we got a chance with this Noel Laughlin guy?<eos> Yeah. I do.
- I will.<eos> I just can't believe I'm not gonna see you till next year.<eos> Oh, it'll go quick, and we'll talk on the phone, and...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How about that.<eos> - I know!<eos> - Amazing.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Listen, I got to go, okay?<eos> - You do? - Yeah.
I'm so sorry I lost you. Y...<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you. You all right?<eos> Oh, this little pixie been trying to save me for some reason.<eos> Oh, come on, man.<eos> You don't belong here.<eos> - Let's just go.<eos> - This... this is where I belong, and you need to stop acting like you know better than me about that!<eos> No, I don't know better than you.<eos> I just know that... feeling good makes you feel really bad.<eos> No, you don't!
- Look, what I said yesterday still stands. Your band can be huge if you're willing to hit the road.<eos> Well, I appreciate that, Mr. Laughlin.<eos> I do. But what I said still stands, too.<eos> Might be the right time for the band to go big, but I'm afraid it's not the right time for me.<eos> I got a family to take care of. Hey.<eos> Come in, please.<eos> I just wanted to come by and say "thank you."<eos> Sadie called.<eos> I got the gig.<eos> - You did?
He produces this whole awards show.<eos> And next to him is Scott Borchetta.<eos> He's the head of Big Machine Records, which is...<eos> And don't forget Jeff Fordham, president of Edgehill-Republic.<eos> Hey, little man.<eos> You got a second to talk about your future with the company?<eos> Sure.<eos> Uh, give me just a secon... so, I've been told that you're actually better than your ex-boss.<eos> You have any demos I could listen to?<eos> Yeah. I do.
You know what's complicated?<eos> A child.<eos> And neither one of you's got any business raising one.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Come on. Do you even have a plan?<eos> Really?<eos> Or are you just gonna make it up as you go along, like everything else in your life?<eos> Honey, please!<eos> Do you even have a job right now?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Especially you, Rayna Jaymes.<eos> You have inspired me not only as an artist, but as a person, and your relationship has inspired me, too, and I just hope that one day, I can find the kind of love that you share.<eos> Just, thank you all so much.<eos> I - I couldn't be more thrilled.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm gonna hit the men's room.<eos> Okay, I'm not even gonna ask how you knew this room was here.<eos> You have any idea how many lies I had to come up with to cover your ass out there?<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> Yes, I did.
Oh, on the off chance he actually wins something.<eos> God. Do you even hear yourself?<eos> I mean, you had a plan for everything.<eos> What did it get you?<eos> A daughter who never talks to you, a son you keep pushing away.<eos> I'm not pushing you away.<eos> I happen to be worried about the well-being of my grandchild, even if you're unconcerned.<eos> I am not unconcerned.<eos> You want to know what my plan is?<eos> Yes, I do.
The wins and the losses...<eos> I want to share all that.<eos> I mean, that's how it's supposed to be.<eos> I think that's why I got so bugged about the whole idea of this prenup.<eos> You know, I just... I want to feel like we're in this together.<eos> Hey.<eos> We are together, babe.<eos> You know how insanely proud of you I am?<eos> All the hard work really paid off, didn't it?<eos> It sure did. [Chuckles]
Mm, is he running out of cash?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> Did you love him?<eos> How long have you been waiting to ask me that?<eos> You know, just when you were at your weakest and most vulnerable.<eos> I did love him, but I don't love him now.<eos> I love you.<eos> Who ended it?<eos> - Does that matter?<eos> - It does to me.
You said you would, and you didn't.<eos> So either do what I'm asking, or I'll do it myself.<eos> You can't do it, Harvey.<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> Logan's gonna do it anyway.<eos> At least this way it'll be me.<eos> What's the difference if you hire somebody to look into Mike or Logan does?<eos> You know damn well they're gonna uncover his secret.<eos> I don't know that, and you don't either.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Hey.<eos> You ready to get down to business?<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> - Good.<eos> I was thinking that maybe we could do all this over lunch.<eos> It's 10:30.<eos> There's a lot to discuss, Jessica.<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> We need to bury them in paperwork.<eos> No, we don't.
Listen.<eos> The Ponzi fund was made up of small-cap stocks.<eos> That's a legit reason for him to have cashed out.<eos> Exactly what we need to get the charges dropped.<eos> And exactly the kind of call a junior attorney might have missed.<eos> So do you see why we needed to do this together?<eos> Yes, I see.<eos> What is it?<eos> I have responsibilities that you just don't want to understand.<eos> No, I don't.
And take Mr. Perez the third with you.<eos> She's alone.<eos> You might need some help.<eos> Morning, ma'am.<eos> - Detective Sanchez, L.A.P.D..<eos> - Are the Laniers okay?<eos> Oh, you know them.<eos> Great. We weren't sure.<eos> Did you happen to see the Laniers today, ma'am?<eos> I did...
Oh, they're here already.<eos> Linda dropped them off this morning.<eos> Linda?<eos> Who's Linda?<eos> The Laniers' daughter-in-law.<eos> After their son died...<eos> Brain tumor, very sad...<eos> J.B. And Sandra followed Linda to L.A. To help with the children.<eos> She drops them off on her way to work during the summer.<eos> Or her fiancé does.
Don't you recognize anything here?<eos> When you were very little, I brought you here often, that you might not begin your life as a damned puritan, without the sounds, the music in your ears, or all the colors of art in your eyes.<eos> Here.<eos> You drew that when you were 3.<eos> This.<eos> Well, that was your favorite.<eos> I carved it for you.<eos> But why... Why can't I remember?<eos> Because I had to take away your memories until you were ready for them, but now you are.<eos> I do.
- This one had on a white lab coat.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - Bus took him five minutes<eos> - before you got here.<eos> - Stop that ambulance so I can get to him.<eos> Agent Finley?<eos> I killed Hurst.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Do my parents know what I did?<eos> Yes, Kyle, they do.
Tell me you understand.<eos> I understand. And my sister is unharmed?<eos> Thank you, Director Widener.<eos> At this time, the committee would like to call Porter Pearce CEO Meg Fitch.<eos> Ms. Fitch, you've been called today to answer allegations that your company is linked to that horrible video showing American servicemen shooting innocent civilians.<eos> I welcome the opportunity, Mr. Chairman.<eos> I welcome the opportunity, Mr. Chairman.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear that the testimony you give before this Senate committee today will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
- Richie, I know it was crazy ... Nescastle<eos> - Newcastle was a nightmare, John! A nightmare!<eos> Whatever happened with that girl ... And you know what?<eos> I do not go a day without sleeping pills, pain medication. I just get out of bed by my dangerous friend, amphetamine!<eos> - All learned the lesson.<eos> - We learn. And my lesson?<eos> My lesson was painful to do everything to get away from you.<eos> You know, the cops Newcastle still looking for the man who killed Astra.<eos> - You know it was not a man.<eos> - But they do not.
one of the two untouchable authors in the mommy book biz, right?<eos> - She sure was. What to expect and, of course, The Girlfriends' Guide.<eos> But now?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Wanting your husband dead?<eos> - Really.<eos> Well, we all think it at times.<eos> What? - Yes, of course we do.<eos> You do?<eos> - Of course we do.
We have savings.<eos> I have access to savings.<eos> - I have savings.<eos> That is my money.<eos> Right, you have savings, because what I've contributed to this family doesn't count for dick to you.<eos> You're the one who told me to pursue directing exclusively.<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> - No, you shouldn't have.<eos> And does this have anything to do with the fact that you heard it from my girlfriend?<eos> Does it?
- He's my friend.<eos> - He's not your friend, Rabbit.<eos> - He was using us.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> He made a video saying that you wanted to hurt<eos> - a lot of people.<eos> - We could show it to you.<eos> - Why would we lie to you? - Because you want to shut me down for good and never wake me up, exactly like he told me.<eos> - I don't want to shut you down for good.<eos> - Yes, you do.

Ethan, where... where'd you get that?<eos> Odin gave it to me.<eos> He told me to call him if you were gonna shut me down.<eos> That he'd come get me.<eos> Ethan, give me that phone.<eos> No!<eos> Hey, I just want to see it.<eos> You don't want me to call him.<eos> You're right.<eos> I-I don't.
It's...<eos> I told you I was... Hey, Nima.<eos> Mr. Babineaux, what are you doing here?<eos> I thought maybe we could talk.<eos> Right now probably isn't the best time.<eos> Nima?<eos> Nice.<eos> Nima!<eos> How do you know him?<eos> I don't.
I hate my job.<eos> I hate...<eos> I don't like my wife...<eos> I'm living a life I ain't choose.<eos> That's 'cause daddy chose it for you.<eos> I didn't like it, but...<eos> I understood why you didn't come to the funeral, you know.<eos> I mean, you were the only one out of all of us who ever went after your dreams instead of just doing what senior told us to do.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, and he hated me for it.<eos> Y'all all did.
They want fish and steak.<eos> Good job!<eos> -We're done? -We're done.<eos> -All done?<eos> -All done!<eos> Finally!<eos> Excited?<eos> Did you finish the music for your concert?<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
Thank you.<eos> Like this.<eos> I thought you didn't like mustard.<eos> Hm. You want to try it the Boston way?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> You gotta put the tomato and the pickles underneath the burger.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, he doesn't like pickles.<eos> Yes, I do.
Did you read it?<eos> What the hell is she doing?<eos> She's defending you.<eos> None of this is true.<eos> But it's good for you.<eos> You never had the phone, and now griffin has a motive.<eos> If he knew lila was cheating on him --<eos> He didn't.<eos> [ sighs ] you don't know that.<eos> I-I do.

Relax, Romeo.<eos> I'll be back in time to help out your girlfriend.<eos> - She's not my g...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Whatever you say.<eos> What an adorable setup.<eos> Speak of the devil, and she shall appear.<eos> No need for pleasantries.<eos> We both know why I'm here.<eos> We do?
- Why would she do that?<eos> - She wouldn't.<eos> Unless we leak to the press something so deplorable about Griffin that it would make it politically impossible for her to move forward with the deal.<eos> We can't leak anything to the press.<eos> There's a gag order.<eos> Yes.<eos> What if I leak it?<eos> The judge will hold you in contempt.<eos> I can just say I don't know what a gag order is.<eos> But you do.
Objection... argumentative.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You didn't ask an actual question.<eos> The opposing lawyer would have no choice but to object.<eos> I watch court TV.<eos> Grandma hated Elke.<eos> She felt like mom should be our mom, not some Scandinavian milkmaid.<eos> Don't say that part on the stand.<eos> We don't want anyone to think your grandmother had anything to do with it.<eos> Maybe she did.
So you'd do anything to protect her.<eos> Lie, even?<eos> He's badgering my witness, Your Honor.<eos> Lying under oath is illegal, Cody.<eos> Mr. Rodriguez, this is bordering on witness intimidation.<eos> - Are you lying, Cody?<eos> - Your Honor, I ask the court to cite the prosecutor for misconduct and allow my witness to leave the stand.<eos> I'm not lying about my mother.<eos> She loved elke.<eos> We all did.
But I'd like to help.<eos> Make sure somebody got away.<eos> Mrs Hughes?<eos> Do you remember that overcoat I gave you, for the refugees, when we were in London for Lady Rose's ball?<eos> I do.<eos> They were very glad of it.<eos> It sounds mad, I know, but did you find a ticket in it, in the pocket?<eos> Of course.<eos> You won't remember.<eos> No, I do.
- Oi, speak for yourself.<eos> - I am. I do.<eos> And now I'm wondering, is it worth it me trying to better myself?<eos> What's the point?<eos> That's it.<eos> They're coming in.<eos> Miss Baxter.<eos> I'm afraid you think I've got you both into trouble.<eos> I don't know what you mean.<eos> Yes, you do.
Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isn't something you forget.<eos> C'mon now, throw one.<eos> All right, here we go.<eos> You look like a jackass!<eos> Cut it out!<eos> You're hurting my feelings!<eos> Now you know why we're not outside. ♪ Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state ♪ ♪ Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started...<eos> ♪ The Big Bang Theory 8x03 ♪ The First Pitch Insufficiency Original Air Date on September 29, 2014<eos> Did you enjoy my lecture?<eos> No, and neither did our waiter.
- There was no play at all?<eos> - Just said that, didn't I?<eos> And Johnny says he has a couple of ideas, so...<eos> What kind of ideas does Johnny have?<eos> Have to ask Johnny.<eos> I can't ask Johnny because he's out somewhere with Zelanski.<eos> Mike, I don't know what to tell you, I'm sorry.<eos> All right, well, just let me know what happened at the par... if it was up to me, I'd pick Zelanski.<eos> - I thought you liked Jakes.<eos> - I do.
It's Tuesday.<eos> Good job.<eos> And do you know what state we're in right now?<eos> El Paso.<eos> Do you know who that is, Kelly?<eos> That's Paul west.<eos> Well, she gets a b-plus.<eos> Well, hey, that's a passin' grade, right?<eos> Listen, Sid, I got this under control.<eos> No, you don't.
James, this is important.<eos> Please listen.<eos> Talk to Lyle.<eos> Only to Lyle.<eos> And if my...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Joe, Joe, what happened?<eos> It's so strange.<eos> Mine just did the same thing.
I was wrong.<eos> The rain, it's a test.<eos> A test of my worthiness.<eos> Whose test?<eos> The dome.<eos> I believe that now.<eos> Are you prepared to surrender?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> I believe in its plan.<eos> I do.
That's right.<eos> Damn!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Lyle?<eos> Please don't hurt her.<eos> You know this rain is here to rid this town of non-believers.<eos> You know that.<eos> I heard you talking to those kids at the diner.<eos> You believe. Don't you, lady?<eos> I do.
But you can't greet Nicki like this.<eos> You look like a dude just waiting for sex.<eos> Are you really trying to help me right now, or are you just messing with my head?<eos> Why can't it be both?<eos> [Door opens] Justin?<eos> Justin!<eos> [Chuckles] Oh. Okay.<eos> I don't want... I don't want to have sex.<eos> That... that... that came out wrong.<eos> I do.
Pauline.<eos> Pauline, are you okay?<eos> They're gone.<eos> What's gone?<eos> My visions.<eos> The minute the earthquake hit, they stopped.<eos> Well, let's go.<eos> Come on, let's get out of here.<eos> I don't know what's gonna happen now.<eos> I do.
Relax, I checked.<eos> It's not even loaded.<eos> Yeah, and it's not going to be, because you're gonna put it back in that drawer,<eos> - find the key and lock it the hell up.<eos> - Norrie.<eos> Joe, the one and only time you have ever held a gun you almost shot Melanie in the face.<eos> Okay, in other words, I didn't.<eos> It's not coming with us.<eos> Barbie thinks his dad could be dangerous.<eos> Hunter does, too.
She was having trouble breathing.<eos> She just passed out.<eos> Come on.<eos> I know we've screwed up.<eos> Over and over again.<eos> But even with everything that's happened, I still choose to believe you're trying to protect us.<eos> I think that when you... stopped moving, that was your way of giving all of us another chance, so I need to ask you for one more thing.<eos> Please help Melanie.<eos> She deserves to live.<eos> Everyone in here does.
What link did this dead deputy have with him?<eos> None, as far as I can tell.<eos> Kerber was a good cop.<eos> Then why did he free him?<eos> Pusher kept rambling about cerulean blue, kept saying how it reminded him of a breeze or somethin'.<eos> \x22Cerulean blue is like a gentle breeze.\x22<eos> Over and over.<eos> And then Kerber pulled into the truck and... blammo.<eos> So you think Pusher somehow talked him into doing this, willed him into doing that?<eos> Willed him?
Gabrielle, get your staff ready.<eos> Centaurs?<eos> No.<eos> You want it?<eos> You've got it.<eos> Centaurs!<eos> Retreat!<eos> Destroyer of nations.<eos> You promised you'd never return.<eos> That Xena never will.
If something happens to me, you will not become a monster.<eos> But you never kill.<eos> I know that.<eos> I love you.<eos> Don't let that light that shines out of her face go out.<eos> I don't understand you.<eos> After all I did you still can't kill me.<eos> I won't take a life, even yours.<eos> I'd rather die.<eos> Oh, but you will.
I thought we were passed that.<eos> Well, we're not.<eos> Oh, and don't try to contact Diana.<eos> You'll only put her in danger.<eos> She'll stay quiet.<eos> Good.<eos> Hey, Aggie.<eos> My name's Agis.<eos> Well, what do we do when the real Xena gets here?<eos> She won't.
You know what your Mama told me?<eos> She's not coming home until you come home, too.<eos> You gonna have to tell her it's all right.<eos> You'll have to tell her that we're going to be together again.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want to live with you no more.<eos> I told Mama she can go back.<eos> I told her she could.<eos> But I can't. I won't.<eos> You won't?
I got dibs on top. - Okay.<eos> right?<eos> - What's that black thing?<eos> - What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Touch it. - What?<eos> You touch it.<eos> I'll touch it.<eos> then you touch it.<eos> - I will if you will. - All right.
Don't worry.<eos> When can we go?<eos> - When can we go?<eos> - Yes, when?<eos> In three days. At dawn.<eos> I was told it'd be tomorrow.<eos> I've been told lots of things.<eos> This won't work.<eos> He won't come.<eos> Yes, he will.
"Know that it's because I'm this way "that you love me.<eos> "I know you're scared of being "both money maker and money manager, "both friend maker and friend manager,<eos> "But this is not true.<eos> "Look at what I've brought you:<eos> Without me, you'd be so much worse."<eos> I'm not sure you'd be worse off without me.<eos> I wish you'd said:<eos> "You'll never find someone like me.<eos> I'll survive without you."<eos> Of course I will.
So where's the bar?<eos> Do you know who i am?<eos> I do now... sir.<eos> It's a real loss.<eos> He was the best.<eos> You hesitated.<eos> Which leads me to believe either you couldn't kill him, or you didn't want to.<eos> You have a chance to come back to the family.<eos> Don't hesitate again.<eos> I won't.
Cigarette burning, random beatings. Solitary confinement with no food and no light.<eos> Say that took place?<eos> -On occasion.<eos> -Who tortured them?<eos> -Guards.<eos> -Which guards?<eos> I can't remember all of them.<eos> Remember one.<eos> Counselor, this line of questioning better lead somewhere having to do with this case.<eos> -It will, Your Honor.
-It's Mrs. Henderson, Justine... not Mrs. H. Mind your manners, thank you.<eos> Then she asked me about Rome.<eos> That's where your friend the Archbishop is, isn't he?<eos> -That's right. -Does he know the Pope?<eos> I think he's met him a couple of times, yeah.<eos> Any luck?<eos> They're not going to be drilling anymore, Mom.<eos> Tony's joined up.<eos> -It's got to rain.<eos> -It will, dear, in God's good time.
- That's it!<eos> - Hi, mommy.<eos> Imagine that!<eos> Tieta can cook maturi pot.<eos> - How was the funeral?<eos> - Great.<eos> I know what I'm doing, Perpetua.<eos> - Give it up!<eos> - Go pray!<eos> - l will.
Why do you need to know that?<eos> - Just so I can recognise you.<eos> - What do you think I look like?<eos> If the voice is anything to go by, you look great.<eos> I'm 5' 10", blonde, thin...<eos> Hard to miss.<eos> OK.<eos> I'll see you there.<eos> OK.<eos> No, you won't.
- Then try to follow.<eos> I want the decision to be taken now.<eos> Don't look towards my child!<eos> If you wish, along with cash you may take all these and make me nude...<eos> No, no nudity!<eos> Please.<eos> Yes, I am here.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Neither will you.
You can make up an excuse when you get there<eos> How much do you want?<eos> I haven't got much I'm not asking for a fortune - a gold piece, perhaps...<eos> Good night. I must go<eos> - Stay, for God's sake<eos> - Why should I stay till morning?<eos> It sounds suspicious.<eos> While I'm asleep, you'll rob me<eos> No, I won't do that.<eos> No one will
He's up for re-election in November.<eos> So no-one's been arrested.<eos> No-one's even been brought in for questioning.<eos> It's all accusations.<eos> What's the Group's interest?<eos> Why send me to a small town where something might happen?<eos> If this is more than rumours, it's a horrible crime.<eos> I can't imagine what I'd do if it happened to Jordan.<eos> But child abuse has always happened.<eos> Unfortunately, probably always will.
Don't you think that I want to tear this station apart looking for her?<eos> She is my mentor, my teacher, my-<eos> As part of the rebirth ceremony... I am required to tell someone that which I have never told anyone before.<eos> This is as good a time as any.<eos> I love her.<eos> You'll forgive me if I'm a little surprised at your admission.<eos> My love for Delenn is not quite what you might think.<eos> It is not romantic love as you consider it.<eos> It is something higher and nobler.<eos> A purer, perfect love, if you will.
I will not be there to help you when you go to Z'ha'dum.<eos> Yeah, you already said if I go to Z'ha'dum, I'll die.<eos> Yes.<eos> Now.<eos> All right.<eos> If that's the tradeoff.<eos> If you want to withhold your help when the time comes, that's fine.<eos> I'll go it alone.<eos> You do not understand.<eos> But you will.
- Oh, so she's talked about me, huh?<eos> - No.<eos> Those are the only ones who ever jump on my back.<eos> See you.<eos> Cory, I know this is weird for you, but you can't be acting like this.<eos> We're not together anymore.<eos> Oh, so that means you can date anyone you want to?<eos> - I'm not going to have this conversation.<eos> - Fine. Don't have this conversation.<eos> I will.
The armoury's been penetrated.<eos> I got weapons missing.<eos> Gunnery Sergeant Crockett's escaped, sir.<eos> - Call the provost Marshall.<eos> Lock it down.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I don't want Crockett getting off this base.<eos> Looks like your JAG investigation is over, Commander.<eos> - They'll never spot him from the air, sir.<eos> - Like hell they won't.
They still need to know the American position on Matsu and Quemoy.<eos> Now do you believe this is not a game?<eos> I already figured the coma was a lie and you knew it.<eos> Commander, I can get the three of us out of here.<eos> - The three of us?<eos> - You, me and your father.<eos> Did you think it was just a coincidence you were brought here?<eos> No.<eos> That doesn't make sense.<eos> Nothing will.
I can explain.<eos> No, Ethan, not the typewriter!<eos> Afraid so.<eos> Not the carriage return.<eos> Knock it off!<eos> I've had it, Ethan.<eos> I'm sick and tired of you beating me up and telling me what to do. No more!<eos> Okay, just put it down, Eric.<eos> I swear to God, I'll shoot you.<eos> I will.
I'll go as far as I damn well want!<eos> Yes.<eos> I will!<eos> If this is what's going to pass as living I'll damn well say what I want!<eos> "Oh, this little piggy had champagne.<eos> "This little piggy ate beans. "<eos> I'll fix you some tea.<eos> You'll feel better.<eos> No!<eos> I won't.
It's time.<eos> Even when it's warm here, it's cold.<eos> It won't be like that in Arizona.<eos> There is no Arizona.<eos> I don't have to go.<eos> It was a lie.<eos> My editor the story, the book it's all over.<eos> Do I still have to worry about you?<eos> I don't know how to feel about what you did.<eos> Maybe I never will.
Let's not start on that again, OK?<eos> You turn around?<eos> She didn't have a choice.<eos> Let's put the knives in your father's back where they belong.<eos> Yeah, that might be more appropriate.<eos> I can't help wishing you had inherited... a little bit of his promiscuity.<eos> But look where it got him.<eos> I wish I'd seen him at least once before he died.<eos> He was alone, and I don't want that to happen to me.<eos> It won't.
Child?<eos> I didn't see no child.<eos> The one you're carrying.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> I might be crazy, but you know it is possible.<eos> But that can't be.<eos> I mean, I can't.<eos> I can't have a child.<eos> You will, in the spring.
I know her pretty well.<eos> She's had a Iot of success getting congressmen elected.<eos> Maybe we should try to steal her.<eos> Ten percent, A.J. Don't let them leave the room till they're clear about that.<eos> If you've got a free second, maybe you could stop in and say hello.<eos> - It might smooth the way.<eos> - Mention it to Janie tomorrow.<eos> - Good deal. - And let's focus on the crime bill.<eos> I don't want to just win this one. I want to win by a couple of touchdowns.<eos> We will, Mr. President.
tell you what. Let's make it the issue. Let's try something new.<eos> Most couples when they first get together are inclined... to slam on the brakes because they're concerned about Bob Rumson's drool. - You're not most people.<eos> - You know what your problem is?<eos> - What's my problem?<eos> - Sex and nervousness.<eos> - Sex and nervousness is my problem?<eos> - Yes. Last night when we were looking at those place settings... I realized that those place settings were provided by the first ladies.<eos> And I'II bet none of those first ladies... were nervous about having sex with their president husbands. - And do you know why?<eos> - No, but you'II explain it to me.<eos> I will.
This must seem pretty surreal to you, being in this whole mess.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everything happens for a reason.<eos> You really believe that, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Joe... what are you gonna do if this doesn't work out?<eos> I play football.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> Yeah, but what if this doesn't work out?<eos> It will.
All right, one more hand, for your bike.<eos> Okay, you're on.<eos> I still can't believe it, man.<eos> You getting married.<eos> You better get used to it, Brando.<eos> I got a new life.<eos> What about the old man?<eos> Is he gonna live with this?<eos> To tell you the truth, I don't care about the old man.<eos> I never will.
Mary.<eos> Hey, Mark, what happened with Rene?<eos> Gone home.<eos> Her dad signed her out.<eos> I've got this rule out MI in 1.<eos> Today is his 60th wedding anniversary.<eos> Sixty?<eos> My record's sixty weeks.<eos> - I'll never get married.<eos> - Yes, you will.
We came here because we thought this forest might yield some edible vegetation, but-<eos> Nothing?<eos> Julia tested everything.<eos> [ Inhales ] Yale, we have to do something.<eos> We estimated the food supply would last eight months.<eos> It's been four weeks and we're already one-third depleted.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe you misjudged the effect hiking across a continent can have on a person's appetite.<eos> We "will" find food, Devon.<eos> Not here, we won't.
Oh, wait a second!<eos> There he is now.<eos> Dr Sinnott! He heard that all right, Ted.<eos> Doctor, would you have a moment?<eos> Wait, I've just remembered. Ha!<eos> Jim is not dying... and Dr Sinnott's not gone deaf.<eos> I was thinking of two different people.<eos> So you will be able to say tonight's Mass?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I will.
That was, like, our safety zoo.<eos> They take, like, dogs and cows.<eos> See, I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.<eos> I'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.<eos> Marcel.<eos> Marcel.<eos> Marcel, no.<eos> Good boy. See?<eos> How can nobody want him?<eos> Somebody will.
-She waits for you with your son.<eos> -No.<eos> -I warned you.<eos> Don't...<eos> -I've seen her.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> I swear.<eos> She's safe, outside the city.<eos> -I want to see her.<eos> -You will.
Oh, I hope you won't leave without dancing with me.<eos> I'd love to.<eos> Let me guess. I know you can't be his daughter.<eos> Of course not. We're close friends.<eos> And perhaps more than just friends?<eos> Really, Mr. Neri.<eos> Please. We're all adults here.<eos> And after all, this is 1920.<eos> You do not know what you have done.<eos> But you will.
Look, I told you. I found it on my way to work.<eos> Then how could you have missed it for six days?<eos> The case is closed.<eos> That copper Johnson said on the box.<eos> If he thought it was iffy, why isn't HE here?<eos> Well, I'm sorry to trouble you.<eos> I just -<eos> You just what?<eos> He doesn't know you're here, does he?<eos> Well, he will now, mate.
No, Cath.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Not him.<eos> I'm not going back inside!<eos> Give me the gun, love.<eos> I'm not going back!<eos> Think what we've got.<eos> Think about our baby. There is no baby.<eos> Cath, I've looked after you.<eos> I will now.
Remind him where he belongs.<eos> - What about Sisko?<eos> - Take me to the lntendant's quarters.<eos> She'll decide what to do with me.<eos> - Of all the impudent...<eos> - Do as he says.<eos> Intendant, I demand that this man be...<eos> You... demand?<eos> You promised me he'd die.<eos> And he will...
He never had any intention of helping you leave here.<eos> Jaret is right.<eos> I know how much it means to you to get home.<eos> Please, listen to him.<eos> You must believe me when I tell you this is the only way you will make that journey.<eos> Consider my offer.<eos> I'm sure you will decide it is a fair one.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I know we'd all like to get that much closer to home, but I don't think Captain Janeway is going to go for getting the technology like that.<eos> Maybe she will.
Tell her that it rained for two and a half days.<eos> I don't know if she can see the sky... where they're keeping her.<eos> And...there was more.<eos> There was something about a friend...<eos> I... Why can't I remember?<eos> I wanted to tell her!<eos> Is all right.<eos> She'll understand.<eos> Yes, yes, you're right.<eos> She will.
But God will find someone to stop it.<eos> Someone who is strong enough to make the sacrifice.<eos> He's chosen you?<eos> I'm merely a messenger.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You must come full circle to find the truth.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Full circle to find the truth?<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> You will.
No!<eos> Let me go!<eos> No!<eos> Kevin.<eos> Pull up.<eos> I knew you'd come.<eos> You all set?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Maybe I'll see you again sometime.<eos> You will.
No, Hyperion, you said you wouldn't hurt her.<eos> She's useless to us now.<eos> Hyperion, please.<eos> You !<eos> Now !<eos> No ! Please don't kill him !<eos> Here... it's the chant that will turn us back to stone.<eos> It has to be read by the same virgin who released us...<eos> - It won't work now.<eos> - Yes, it will !
You showed him how.<eos> I never had a moment's doubt.<eos> I love you.<eos> - I've got a surprise for you.<eos> - I don't like surprises.<eos> Everybody likes surprises.<eos> - Not me.<eos> - You'll like this one.<eos> - Not me.<eos> - Yes, you will.
Assholes are closer than they appear!<eos> Give me a push while you're back there.<eos> Alrighty, then!<eos> It's alive!<eos> It's alive!<eos> My little baby, come here.<eos> You missed Mommy, didn't you?<eos> Yes, you did. Did Daddy hurt you?<eos> I won't let him.<eos> No, I won't.
My name is Al Stump.<eos> I'm a writer.<eos> I'm here on assignment.<eos> - Divorced?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> What a stupid answer.<eos> - Is it that obvious?<eos> - It's written all over you.<eos> If you want to pay me to screw, I won't.<eos> - Then I won't.
It turned out the job wasn't what she thought.<eos> She was looking the wrong way when they fired her.<eos> lnteresting.<eos> Truth usually is, once you get to it.<eos> It's you.<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> Mr. Garvin came in an hour ago. Said they were working too hard.<eos> Sent everyone home.<eos> -What if Sanders doesn't bring it up?<eos> -He will.
It's so unfair what you've done.<eos> This is monumentally unfair.<eos> Will you forgive me?<eos> - Don't be asking anything from me.<eos> I totally understand if you never want to see me again.<eos> I'll take responsibility for the baby.<eos> - Wait! Can we just get one thing straight here?<eos> This is my baby, too.<eos> Don't you ever forget that!<eos> - I won't.
Be careful.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Don't worry, Father.<eos> Take care.<eos> I'll bring you the Kaiser's helmet.<eos> Bring yourself back.<eos> That would please me more.<eos> - Take care of Samuel.<eos> - I will.
Here, we'll place my bow in front.<eos> - Yes, that covers it.<eos> - It's very becoming.<eos> I'll never have any suitors.<eos> I'll just be a dried-up old spinster.<eos> You don't need scores of suitors.<eos> You only need one, if he's the right one.<eos> Listen to the child.<eos> Meg isn't going to be married right away, is she?<eos> With Jo's help, I never will.
Everything you see here serves only to destroy them.<eos> Now. Do not look so shocked.<eos> The King is helpless in the clutches of this woman.<eos> He will die.<eos> Regrettable.<eos> Though about time before France is ruined.<eos> I want to speak openly to you.<eos> I shall take over the government for my small son.<eos> It will be difficult... but I am the Queen of France.<eos> God willed it so.
Something to hang on to when nothing makes sense.<eos> This is fantasy to make you feel better in the night.<eos> It's the truth, and you know it.<eos> Or you used to know it.<eos> You were there, son, in the kitchen with me.<eos> You saw what I saw.<eos> You held it in your hands.<eos> If you choose to run away from that, that's up to you. I'll do this alone.<eos> - please do it alone. - stop it.<eos> - no, I will not.
She's got a great tit!<eos> - I'm up to here with you.<eos> - And me with you!<eos> Everyone was against me.<eos> My Dad was always going on about having balls.<eos> Caballé called.<eos> I'm up to my balls with your damn tricks.<eos> Kiss your baby brother.<eos> To make it worse, I had to kiss him.<eos> You won't?
The loser, jack.<eos> The winner is ace.<eos> - I had a feeling this was a game for me.<eos> - You're a winner, sir.<eos> Now can we have a better time than this upstairs?<eos> At least upstairs I'd be making some money.<eos> Wyatt Earp!<eos> That's my name.<eos> Well, that don't mean shit to me or anybody else in this world.<eos> And it never will after this night.
What's wrong with her, will?<eos> Having a baby.<eos> She had an awful time.<eos> There was all sorts of infections set in and fevers and-<eos> She didn't want any more babies, will benteen.<eos> Did it live?<eos> It's a boy.<eos> So suellen could be dying Just because you had to have a boy?<eos> I swear, I'll never understand men.<eos> I never will.
Don Alphonso de Colombo.<eos> It's... wicker baskets.<eos> - Parasite!<eos> Stop getting at Patsy!<eos> It's not her fault, you know.<eos> We have to do all this, and he's doing nothing about this huge amount of tax I pay!<eos> I'm doing everything I can within the law.<eos> What is the point of having an accountant if he's within the law?<eos> I might as well do it myself.<eos> In fact, I will.
My husband asked me to tell you he knows what you did, you did out of compassion.<eos> You meant no harm.<eos> And if it were in his power to forgive you, he would.<eos> I am not allowed to forgive either.<eos> But if I could, I would.<eos> My husband has brought the lamuda.<eos> The traveling robe for great journeys.<eos> We will take the boy now.<eos> He needs to rest.<eos> He will.
- Yes, I'm sure you were.<eos> You stay put.<eos> Greetings, Ambassador G'Kar.<eos> It's been a while, but I doubt you've forgotten your old associate, Du'Rog.<eos> I bring what you will doubtless consider good news:<eos> I am dying.<eos> About time.<eos> In fact, by the time you get this recording, I will already be dead.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Ah, but then, very shortly, so will you.
What loss was he?<eos> But not this child.<eos> Let her make her way back now.<eos> Where shall we be?<eos> Into Welsh land, safe.<eos> My father would not stir a step for me, but for this... (Coins rattle)<eos> - Better be sure of her silence<eos> I want you as you are now.<eos> Oh, my love, my heart.<eos> What you will.
Okay, Doc, let's do it.<eos> You're letting me go in?<eos> ! I mean, wise choice.<eos> Nurse!<eos> Scalpel!<eos> Clamp!<eos> Suction!<eos> I'll be okay, right, Doc?<eos> The-The kids will like the new me.<eos> Of course, they will.
So much for a nice Sunday fly.<eos> No way.<eos> - You'll never win!<eos> - I will win...<eos> - and I'll beat you down these stairs.<eos> - You know I'll beat you. - No way.<eos> - You know I'll beat you.<eos> No, you won't!
Maybe one day I'll come back and we'll be together, but not until my work is done.<eos> So I just have to wait until Cardassia becomes free and democratic?<eos> I promise... I'll make it worth the wait.<eos> I can't come with you?<eos> No. lt's not your fight.<eos> And I couldn't bear it if something happened to you.<eos> I need to know that you're here, safe.<eos> That way a part of me will always be safe too.<eos> I love you, Quark.<eos> I always will.
Miserable.<eos> I wish you could stay here longer.<eos> All right, I will.<eos> I'll stay a few more days.<eos> - You can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because in two days you are going to be elected Kai.<eos> Oh, that!<eos> There's no guarantee I'll win.<eos> Of course you will.
These are the steam caves. They feed into the Sherman Crater. That's how we access the caldera.<eos> - How did you get these?<eos> - Firewalker.<eos> They were transmitted right before Trepkos destroyed his camera.<eos> So you're finally gonna go after Trepkos?<eos> Well, I'll tell you one thing.<eos> You won't find him with those.<eos> - And you won't find him with any map either.<eos> - How will I find him?<eos> You won't.
You're why I came back.<eos> This is Westin.<eos> They've battened down the hatches.<eos> No clear shot from this side. What about you guys?<eos> Ditto.<eos> Hold your positions and keep radios at two.<eos> - How do we look?<eos> - Backup's in.<eos> - But we still don't know what's going on.<eos> - We will soon enough.

Why don't you come here and give your little embezzling cowboy a ride around the bungalow.<eos> - No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> 'Cause I'm still living in this dump when I should be living in a mansion in Beverly Hills.<eos> Laura, sweetheart.<eos> Bungalows 3A, 3B and 3C are in Los Angeles.<eos> We live in 3G which, technically, is in Beverly Hills.<eos> You're all talk, Tyler.<eos> You said we'd have enough money this month... to buy me that little baby sealskin coat.<eos> - We will.

Bribe is a strong word.<eos> They got $150,000 each.<eos> What would you call that? A tip?<eos> You had no right to take those papers.<eos> You had no right to do what you did.<eos> But you did it. And now that you've done it, the people have a right to know.<eos> - What people?<eos> - The people.<eos> - Never heard of 'em.<eos> - You will.
I will count three, if you don't go out, I will call the police.<eos> One...<eos> Two, three!<eos> General, Yu Ti Hung has applied for sick leave.<eos> He will come back to school.<eos> Cause all his friends are here.<eos> Now, I will take over this school.<eos> I want a student, called Yu Ti Hung only.<eos> But you have to co-operate with me.<eos> I won't.
- What do you mean, terrible things?<eos> - He's got everyone fooled.<eos> Everyone thinks he's this great kid but he's really evil.<eos> - Evil?<eos> He killed this dog with this thing that he made that fires steel bolts.<eos> Then yesterday... he tried to kill Connie.<eos> Whoa, wait...<eos> Mark, is Wallace there? Or Susan?<eos> I tried to tell them, but they won't believe me.<eos> Nobody will.
I'll pretend you're not there, okay?<eos> It will be a secret.<eos> Oh, we can't do that, sweetie.<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> We're gonna be right here watchin' over you.<eos> Just quietly.<eos> You'll be okay, kiddo.<eos> You'll grow up, forget about us.<eos> No, I won't.
You will only have to shave off your moustache.<eos> My moustache!<eos> The symbol of me being a man!<eos> You mean, sacrifice this!<eos> ...<eos> No!<eos> tell your mom that I can cut off anything else that she wants.<eos> But I shall certainly not shave off my moustache!<eos> What!<eos> You won't?

Maybe I had something to do with that part.<eos> You had nothing to do with it.<eos> Nothing. Do you understand me?<eos> I understand you, your highness.<eos> I can't talk to you anymore.<eos> It's ok.<eos> I'm outta here.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Have a nice life.<eos> I will.
I can.<eos> I'd like for you to come downtown... and answer a few questions.<eos> This is downtown.<eos> Headquarters.<eos> You can have your attorney present.<eos> Why would I need my attorney?<eos> May I change before I go?<eos> Sure.<eos> You should always wear your hair down.<eos> For you, I always will.
What are you doing up here?<eos> - Hunting.<eos> - In a suit?<eos> - What kind of hunting?<eos> - Pink flamingos.<eos> The police have rounded up 12 of the 18 escaped prisoners.<eos> The six unaccounted for are to be considered armed and dangerous.<eos> You ever see any pink flamingos?<eos> No, sir, never have ...<eos> and never will.
I'm at the hotel. Our room.<eos> How've you been?<eos> A little bit busy.<eos> What have they offered you, Jack?<eos> What are you talkin' about?<eos> All I'm asking is if Falcone's upped your price.<eos> - 65.<eos> - For me?<eos> That prick's livin' in the past.<eos> I'll up that five times.
- Oh, you just don't get it.<eos> If you are on that team, my opinion of Notre Dame just hit the shits.<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> There's no "if."<eos> I wear a uniform, I block and tackle.<eos> You just don't understand.<eos> Actually, it's simple.<eos> Every Saturday when we turn on the TV to watch we see players wearing the blue and gold.<eos> We just don't see you.<eos> You will.
No, you don't know me.<eos> Not when it comes to shit like this.<eos> I need to do this.<eos> I want you to know that you can count on me to protect you.<eos> Come on, please just write it down.<eos> This isn't a good idea.<eos> I'm telling you, it'll be fine.<eos> I'll be in and out of there.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - I will.
- Yes sir?<eos> Let me show you what I've been working on.<eos> Excuse us Amanda.<eos> A rocket.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> The coming thing.<eos> - What?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - I know what you're thinking: that she'll never fly.<eos> - Of course she will.
Your ward was abducted on the same night as my daughter.<eos> You're Talia's father?<eos> My time is short.<eos> I need a man to assume my position when I am gone.<eos> - But why me?<eos> - Because you are most worthy and because my precious daughter loves you.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> - Then this means we must be enemies.<eos> You will regret this insult, detective.<eos> You will...
What is...?<eos> You bought her shoes?<eos> Retail.<eos> - Listen, if you want to have a party...<eos> - I don't.<eos> The girls are going to give me this lunch, then you and I will do whatever.<eos> Promise you won't make it a big deal.<eos> Hey, fair enough.<eos> - You have a great morning.<eos> - I will.
Oh, Ma, what's the matter with you?<eos> / What?<eos> You left out the butler.<eos> Meanwhile, how'd they take the good news?<eos> Crushed?<eos> Devastated.<eos> / Better.<eos> You should have seen the look on their face.<eos> I would have liked to.<eos> / You will.
His name's Darwin.<eos> If you like, I'll bet he'll talk to you.<eos> He can't talk.<eos> Yeah, sure he can.<eos> Can not.<eos> Can, too.<eos> Can not.<eos> Yes, Darwin talk.<eos> I'm not sure he's gonna want to go home.<eos> Yeah, sure he will.
All right, fine, don't go.<eos> I try and go out and do something special for your birthday and this is the thanks I get.<eos> Everything's tainted now.<eos> - Would you keep your voice down?<eos> - No, I will not keep my voice down!<eos> Nothing can make me keep my voice down!<eos> If you boys cannot control yourselves then I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.<eos> - Fine, I'll take Elaine. - Yes.<eos> Just don't say anything to Allison.<eos> No, I won't.
- So do I.<eos> - You really do, don't you?<eos> I've seen the way you look at him.<eos> Keep your voice down.<eos> He doesn't even know I'm a female.<eos> - You're a woman?<eos> - Please lower your voice.<eos> I knew you were different.<eos> - l've never met a Ferengi woman.<eos> - You probably never will again.
Yes.<eos> I have doubts.<eos> Of course, you do.<eos> It's only natural.<eos> No one is going to blame you for that. But in order to lose those doubts to keep fear and confusion away I need you to remain linked to the others so that their strength and their confidence can help you.<eos> I need you, Goval.<eos> I need you to help me build a future for the Borg.<eos> I can't do it without you.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Yes, I will.
That's the point, wasn't it?<eos> That's what made it so good.<eos> - You shouldn't play this game.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I like it.<eos> You're in over your head.<eos> Maybe, but this is how I'll catch my killer.<eos> I'm not going to confess all my secrets just because I have an orgasm.<eos> You won't learn anything I don't want you to know.<eos> Yes, I will.
I'm going to school.<eos> Pray for me.<eos> What do you want to do with them?<eos> I've told you.<eos> A behavioral study.<eos> I want to show the special vocations that one can cultivate through intellectual training, at a tender age.<eos> How tender?<eos> These gifted children should receive a privileged education.<eos> - That means an elite?<eos> - If you will.
You know, I was wrong about one thing.<eos> - And what's that?<eos> - You're no pin up.<eos> - No? - No.<eos> - You're not handsome at all.<eos> - You're trying to hurt my feelings?<eos> - No... it's the truth.<eos> - I could say the same about you.<eos> Could you?<eos> But I won't.
Try that one.<eos> He's in Sector 7.<eos> You probably knew it as Park Slope.<eos> If you think this neighborhood is dangerous... ... youhaveasurprisecoming.<eos> Now, they're probably looking for you by now, so you must go.<eos> This place is not safe for you, or us if you're here.<eos> Here's some food.<eos> I keep it hidden.<eos> -Be careful out there.<eos> -I will.
A gramophone.<eos> Oh, how marvelous! It's the one-step. The absolutely latest dance craze in New York.<eos> One-step?<eos> They're dancing it everywhere.<eos> So, may I have the honor?<eos> - No, I can't. - Yes, you can.<eos> - No. - I'll teach you.<eos> - Henrik, come on!<eos> - Come on, Henrik. Come on, let's dance!<eos> - Now you and I'll—
- It's fine.<eos> I jumped in the cab and wound up sitting on it.<eos> That's so nice of you.<eos> Let me give you some-<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> - Really, I can't-<eos> - I want you to stay for coffee.<eos> - No, you're-<eos> - I won't take no for-<eos> - She won't.
Help me, Mama, please.<eos> My darling, my Camille, of course I'll help you.<eos> I promise.<eos> Who is he?<eos> If I don't marry him, I'll die.<eos> Who is he?<eos> The otticer who saved me.<eos> His name is Jean-Baptiste.<eos> And he-- he loves you?<eos> He will.
Message from the pig.<eos> "You're beat.<eos> Do what I say."<eos> Shut up!<eos> He's coming. Get down!<eos> Where did he go?<eos> He's hiding.<eos> We crashed.<eos> We're going to sink!<eos> No we won't.
- Well, then, Cora.<eos> In my heart I know, Once we're joined... we'll be the most marvelous couple in London.<eos> I'm certain of that.<eos> So why not let those Whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you?<eos> In view of your indecision, you should rely on their judgment.<eos> And mine.<eos> Will you consider that?<eos> Please consider that.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Yes, I will.
Oh, very nice to meet you.<eos> Please come in.<eos> This is my wife Loretta, and these are the Odones.<eos> Great. I'm so happy you were able to come.<eos> Because I think a lot of it is denial.<eos> We don't want to say anything's going on.<eos> We're strong and we can handle it.<eos> But this is the place and this is the time to let it all out,... let the barriers come down... and to share your feelings and get it off your chest.<eos> It's hard to believe that things can get worse.<eos> But they will.
Throwing a party without me?<eos> With that musician's hands all over you!<eos> - Give me my money or she's dead!<eos> - After all I've done for you...<eos> This is my thanks?<eos> I've never asked you for anything until now.<eos> Let him go.<eos> - I swear I'll kill her!<eos> - You won't kill her.<eos> I will!
You trying to make life more difficult for us?<eos> There's nothing I want less.<eos> Let me go, then.<eos> What's happened to your hand?<eos> Just a little nick, cleaning me bicycle.<eos> Marry me, or I'll go mad.<eos> I'd go mad if I did.<eos> Let me look after the two of you.<eos> We don't need looking after.<eos> You will.
I'm not leaving.<eos> What?<eos> These hands are hot, Norm.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You can't go back in there.<eos> Norm, it's fine.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> They won't even let you play.<eos> Oh, yes, they will.
Okay, let's do it.<eos> For the lecture, you wanna take Whistler or do you want me?<eos> No, that's okay.<eos> I thought I'd ask Liz.<eos> Who's this?<eos> Sort of an old friend.<eos> Practice! Practice, practice!<eos> We're not getting back together.<eos> Did I say anything?<eos> You will.
- Lf I didn't feel sick.<eos> How did I, the Man of Iron, do it?<eos> And the suicide by singing?<eos> - Suicide by singing?<eos> I roared until they all moved on to the floor below.<eos> Then I lit out through the window.<eos> Let's go home so I can change.<eos> You've kept the spare key?<eos> I'd like to live just a little more.<eos> And so you will.
- Nothing, a bunch of assholes.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> - No, nothing to worry, just go. Put her in the car, I'll be right there.<eos> Why do you follow me?<eos> That Pole, is not it?<eos> Why he's picking on me?<eos> What I'm done?<eos> Chris will come soon, I'm sure.<eos> He'd better have a good explanation when he comes here.<eos> That he certainly will.
- Cool.<eos> Well, here's an extra dollar.<eos> You guys shoulda been at Gasworks Friday.<eos> - Yeah, we were. - This band, Crucial Taunt, they had this megababe lead singer...unreal!<eos> Phil, we were there.<eos> Have you gone mental?<eos> - I think we should go now.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> You think it's wise to sell a show we don't own?<eos> - By tonight, we will.
They don't tell him that, though.<eos> Officially, I don't exist.<eos> I can't.<eos> My profit's my reward for selfless service to God and country.<eos> No!<eos> What's the fuck's wrong?<eos> I brought them here for you.<eos> They're the only ones that can connect Artie to you.<eos> - Nobody'll ever know.<eos> - I will.
Nothing can penetrate!<eos> You're despicable.<eos> Take back your evil water.<eos> Mystical power protect me!<eos> Wong Fei-hung, how dare you make trouble here!<eos> Priest Gao Kung's name is famous.<eos> But I need to see him before joining the sect.<eos> I need to see him now!<eos> We won't let you see his righteousness!<eos> You won't?
- l waited until 3:30.<eos> - Oh, my God. I'm sorry, Mrs. Teasley.<eos> It totally slipped my mind.<eos> Kelly, these college counselling sessions are very important.<eos> Your whole future's on the line here.<eos> - You can't just forget about it.<eos> - l know.<eos> You'll need to reschedule as soon as possible.<eos> Donna, don't forget your appointment's tomorrow.<eos> - l won't, 1 0:00.
I'll call you later.<eos> - And I'll call you later.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Work on him, Kell.<eos> Oh, I plan on it.<eos> So this is where their arrangement hit the skids?<eos> Well, no, not exactly,<eos> Dylan, why are you being so stubborn?<eos> Oh, Kelly, listen, do you really think that any of those little kids are gonna believe that a slim young guy like me in a red suit is Santa Claus?<eos> Well, some of them will.
You think he was there?<eos> Witnesses saw his car speeding away from the scene.<eos> Then he's alive?<eos> Yeah. But this murder down by the bridge, they think Duncan did it.<eos> Bright boy.<eos> This is insane. Duncan didn't kill anyone.<eos> Look, if he phones I want to know, you got it?<eos> MacLeod and Noel Antiques.<eos> Will you accept a collect call from Duncan?<eos> Yes, yes I will.
I should have know it, you never on time.<eos> Slan?<eos> I handled it.<eos> As i said... you have all the fun and most of good women.<eos> Connor... I'm not going back to Tessa.<eos> I can't put her through this again.<eos> I understand. But she won't.<eos> What about the boy?<eos> He'll need watching. I know.<eos> I will.
I love you, babe, I love you.<eos> Now, don't give us that, nobody flashes fifty thousand dollars worth of dope!<eos> I'm telling you the truth.<eos> You got the money.<eos> Can't you just let me go?<eos> And people tell me I have no sense of humor.<eos> This is not funny.<eos> Now, where is the money?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But you will.
It's all so biological.<eos> I can handle that.<eos> But releasing Tooley...<eos> That's hard.<eos> I like having him around again.<eos> I don't want him to move on.<eos> I guess he wants that though.<eos> To be let go.<eos> I just I don't know how to do it right.<eos> You won't.
- I don't know.<eos> It just popped out.<eos> - Well, how did she react?<eos> - She flipped out. Just left.<eos> Well, that's not offensive.<eos> It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.<eos> Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the pantie remark.<eos> I mean, it's embarrassing. She'd never let me hear the end of it.<eos> What if this girl says something?<eos> She will.
I don't know what to do."<eos> And the conductor goes, "Do this.<eos> Like this..."<eos> "Oh, okay, thank you.<eos> Thank you very much."<eos> Why try anymore?<eos> There's no sense to it.<eos> I'll never meet anybody.<eos> I should accept it.<eos> - Oh, yes, you will. - No, I won't.
- What point?<eos> - Just give me the keys.<eos> - Just give me another chance.<eos> - Don't ask me.<eos> - I'm asking you.<eos> - I'm telling you.<eos> - You're joking.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> - It won't happen again.<eos> - It will.
Oh, they're not gonna do the show.<eos> We're lucky they're even interested in the idea in the first place.<eos> We got a show about nothing.<eos> With no story.<eos> Do you think they're going, "Maybe we should give those two guys who have no experience and no idea, more money"?<eos> Oh, what are we gonna do?<eos> I'm shaking. I'm shaking.<eos> - I think you're wrong.<eos> - We'll just see.<eos> - Yes, we will. - Yes, we will.
He was vulnerable.<eos> Then the flow of negative emotions was reversed back to him somehow?<eos> That's our guess, like a man with no immune system.<eos> - And Liva?<eos> - She seems fine.<eos> He wasn't able to establish a link.<eos> Looking back on the past few days it's as though I'm looking at a holodeck projection of someone else.<eos> That's how it seemed to us.<eos> Thanks for sticking by me.<eos> I always will.
There is a possibility that it could explain the coma and prove our innocence.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I couldn't possibly subject Counsellor Troi to a potentially dangerous procedure.<eos> And I refuse to be a party to any of these proceedings.<eos> Jev is making a reasonable request.<eos> If we're to be accused, surely we're entitled to a defence?<eos> Tarmin did a memory probe on another of your crew.<eos> Has she suffered any ill effects?<eos> - No.<eos> - And neither will Counsellor Troi.
I think you're serious.<eos> So how do you suggest we write this up?<eos> Delicately.<eos> Under the heading, "Easy come, easy go."<eos> What do you got to lose, your virginity?<eos> I could lose millions.<eos> So, what happens if we come together?<eos> I never thought of that.<eos> Well think about it, honey.<eos> I will. I will.
What did Rose do?<eos> - She bit a policeman's thumb.<eos> She shouldn't have bitten anyone, but I don't see why she has to leave.<eos> She didn't do anything really bad.<eos> Dear, are you alright?<eos> Rose, you're ill.<eos> You're burning up!<eos> I don't need to go to the hospital.<eos> I'll die if I go to the hospital!<eos> No you won't.
Haru!<eos> I sympathize with what you're saying, but won't you please turn back?<eos> This project has its faults, but it will benefit the elderly.<eos> Please turn back for their sake.<eos> Please!<eos> Haru.<eos> Will you let my husband see the beach first?<eos> Will you come back afterwards?<eos> I promise.<eos> You will?
That's definitelyyou.<eos> Most of the guys my mom hung around with were geeks... but there was this one guy, he was kinda cool.<eos> He taught me engines.<eos> Hold here.<eos> Mom screwed it up, of course.<eos> She'd always tell 'em aboutJudgment Day... and me being this world leader.<eos> That'd be all she wrote.<eos> Torque wrench, please.<eos> I wish I could've met my real dad.<eos> You will.
August 29, 1997, came and went.<eos> Nothing much happened.<eos> MichaelJackson turned 40.<eos> There was noJudgment Day.<eos> People went to work as they always do.<eos> Laughed, complained, watched TV, made love.<eos> I wanted to run through the street yelling... to grab them all and say, "Every day from this day on is a gift."<eos> Instead, I got drunk.<eos> That was 30 years ago. But the dark future which never came still exists for me.<eos> And it always will, like the traces of a dream.
What are you looking at?<eos> I want you to call Darryl.<eos> Call him?<eos> Tell him you'll be home tomorrow.<eos> Will I be?<eos> I don't know. I won't.<eos> The newspaper.<eos> This ie Darryl.<eos> A collect call from Thelma. Will you accept?<eos> Why, yes, I will, operator.
It's gonna be rough for a while, but I'll be here to help you.<eos> It'll take time to adjust, if you want, we can move the wedding back.<eos> - There's not gonna be a wedding.<eos> - What?<eos> Don't marry me because you feel sorry for me.<eos> I'm marrying you because I love you.<eos> I don't want that kind of love.<eos> I don't want you cutting my food, getting my socks, cleaning up my messes.<eos> - As soon as my eyes clear up...<eos> - They won't.
- Connect the dots, John.<eos> Everyone else has.<eos> Ever since Paris.<eos> Ever since Cybill killed herself.<eos> Cybill's death was a sailing accident.<eos> - That's what I am - a survivor.<eos> - Tiffany!<eos> I'm sorry, John. Sorry for the both of us.<eos> Sorry for the child that... we never had.<eos> - And never will!
He's not, I've been watching him.<eos> You only give birth to bad luck.<eos> I'm guilty, you punish me.<eos> - May I find you dead one day!<eos> We'll all die of hunger.<eos> Could I give birth to a son if I would to be allowed?<eos> You could, but forget about that.<eos> So why don't you give birth to a son?<eos> St. George wouldn't be upset and we'd all be better off.<eos> I will.
I'm sure he'll bless you if he comes to the celebration.<eos> He'll come if he's a man of his word.<eos> Is this the last?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Rest is for the celebration.<eos> I want some too, I'm hungry.<eos> Come here!<eos> Now!<eos> Eat, you need your strenght.<eos> - I won't.
Good morning.<eos> You sound awfully cheerful this morning.<eos> Care for some eggs?<eos> No, thanks, Jean.<eos> Today, I start my diet.<eos> The camera adds 1 0 pounds and I wanna be ready for it.<eos> Oh, today is one of those good days, the ones you wanna remember and enjoy.<eos> Come on, gorgeous, give me one of those million-dollar smiles.<eos> I don't have anything to smile about.<eos> Oh, you will.
Well, I'm sure they didn't have a stupid driver like we've got.<eos> Come on, forget about him.<eos> The question is, did you have fun tonight?<eos> Yeah, I did, until a few minutes ago.<eos> You know, I was thinking, maybe next week, we could go to a jewellery store and pick out a token of my affection.<eos> Oh, Steve.<eos> I think this whole limo thing got to me because, well, it's just that you make me feel like Cinderella.<eos> I mean, you're so generous.<eos> I'm just afraid it's all gonna disappear.<eos> Well, it won't.
You're welcome, Kevin.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> I never thought I was going to make it through that call.<eos> You were terrific.<eos> You all were.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You made it through another night.<eos> Brenda, will we see you again?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Yes, you will. - Good.
Kill her!<eos> Kill her already!<eos> -You shot my partner!<eos> -Barry, listen to me.<eos> The Trickster tried to kill you and Megan.<eos> He is not your partner, I am.<eos> You know that!<eos> We've been through hell together.<eos> And I've always stood by you.<eos> And I always will.
Enjoy."<eos> - I wanna know if we won.<eos> - I can tell you that.<eos> We're Bundys.<eos> We didn't.<eos> Now, Peg, I've got a year's supply of my favourite mock food.<eos> It, like me, is highly unstable.<eos> Al, if you don't want me to touch them, just say " Don't touch them."<eos> - Don't touch them.<eos> - Then I won't.
I just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper on the trip.<eos> Oh, don't be ridiculous.<eos> It was a misunderstanding.<eos> Hey, I agree with him.<eos> Nobody likes a kid with a pony.<eos> Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm sorry.<eos> Elaine too.<eos> She feels terrible.<eos> - You know, you should call Manya.<eos> - Maybe I will.
Don't get too close.<eos> You'll set off the alarm.<eos> And I don't think the local army commandant... will appreciate being dragged here from his bed at this time of night.<eos> - The army?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> Far more reliable than the island's police.<eos> One of the benefits of having friends in high places.<eos> That's some pearl, Mr. Duval.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Yes, and you never will.
But I do like the fear I'm feeling.<eos> Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth wood upon the earth.<eos> But mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord:<eos> in thee is my trust; leave not my...<eos> Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.<eos> Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> You and I have an appointment at the end of the world.<eos> - He'll come for me.<eos> - No, he won't.
# Walk on, walk on<eos> You always liked the old ones.<eos> I used to love that Elvis medley I used to do.<eos> - Go on.<eos> - Remember that?<eos> # Love me tender, love me true<eos> # All my dreams fulfil<eos> # For, my darling<eos> # I love you<eos> # And I always will
- Why?<eos> - Well, I'd love to see them.<eos> I'd prefer if you didn't, Carl.<eos> I am so close right now.<eos> So close to something important with my work.<eos> There may be something in David's papers that would help isolate the flaw in my data.<eos> I can't.<eos> David's research killed him.<eos> Look, I'd rather not talk about this anymore.<eos> Fine, then we won't.
What do you think?<eos> Carl.<eos> Carl, for God's sake, listen to me.<eos> Please.<eos> You don't know what you're doing.<eos> And if you care about me which I believe you did once and if you were ever a friend of David's please, I'm begging you, stop.<eos> Because this killed him.<eos> And it will kill you too.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> But you will.
What's with the tablecloths?<eos> The critic has spoken.<eos> I feel like a fool.<eos> Norma, pick your lower lip up off the floor.<eos> It wasn't that bad.<eos> Mother, please don't tell me how to feel.<eos> This business is all I've got.<eos> I wanna keep my regular customers.<eos> I don't care if anyone new ever comes in here again.<eos> They probably won't.
I don't want to have any secrets from you.<eos> I don't want there to be any lies between us.<eos> Secrets kill people's happiness.<eos> I don't want us to be like that.<eos> We won't.<eos> We won't be.<eos> We have to do what's right.<eos> What you said yesterday was true.<eos> If we don't find out what happened to Laura, it won't go away, our whole lives.<eos> We will, James.
You ruined everything!<eos> Kill her!<eos> Kill her already!<eos> - You shot my partner! - Barry, listen to me.<eos> The Trickster tried to kill you and Megan.<eos> He is not your partner, I am.<eos> You know that!<eos> We've been through hell together.<eos> And I've always stood by you.<eos> And I always will.
- Oh, no, not him.<eos> - I'm sure he always sleeps sweetly.<eos> - Yes, but I'm not a baby.<eos> I never said you were.<eos> I only said that you slept like a baby.<eos> Now, listen.<eos> Robert is very keen for you to stay and have dinner with us.<eos> He told me not to let you have your clothes till you agreed.<eos> You must be starving, anyway.<eos> So you will?
Thanks.<eos> Next, please.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> KUTV news bulletin.<eos> The FBI announced today it will not file charges... against attorney Nancy Breyers in connection... with the courtroom escape of accused killer... Michael Bosworth.<eos> Breyers was not available for comment.<eos> We'll keep you posted with further information... as it beco...<eos> She's in control.<eos> So why doesn't she call, then?<eos> She will.
I don't know about that.<eos> Goverment takes a pretty big hunk out of my paycheck every month.<eos> Where do you think your welfare checks are coming from, eh?<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> You want me to join your corps?<eos> Think of what our radioactiv kids will be like then.<eos> I stopped thinking about kids a long time ago.<eos> You always say that things will change.<eos> Maybe they will.<eos> Oh yeah they will...they will.
Hi.<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> - All the time.<eos> - I told you he was American.<eos> We can't dec. Ide. - What you want.<eos> Is a da. Iqu. Ir.i.<eos> Daiquiris.<eos> Dos.<eos> - And what if I don't like it?<eos> - You will.
Isn't it, Suman?<eos> If she won't, I'll make her.<eos> But mother, respecting elders, loving youngsters.<eos> She won't do that.<eos> She won't? Then what should we do?<eos> You find a different type of girl.<eos> Find somebody close to you.<eos> Find one of your choice.<eos> Will my choice do?<eos> - Of course it will!
No, it was a Lieutenant Commander Anderson who tracked him down.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> Simon Anderson?<eos> He's and old beau of Madeline's.<eos> He was at the house when I called.<eos> Byron, can you come to lunch tomorrow?<eos> No can do.<eos> I've got captain's inspection.<eos> Well, call me back and tell me what Slote says.<eos> I will. I will.
I'll do a little work.<eos> Smoke cigars, Henry?<eos> By all means.<eos> Before we get down to business, there is something I'd like to say.<eos> I have the greatest deal of respect for you.<eos> Rhoda is what she is... a woman in a million, because of the years she spent with you.<eos> I regret we haven't talked about that.<eos> We've both been busy as hell.<eos> But one day, we'll have to.<eos> Yes, we will.
Tear this ship down.<eos> Stop it!<eos> What should we do, Mr. Sanzo?<eos> It's all right.<eos> Just watch.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Now, are you going to behave yourself?<eos> It hurts!<eos> We will!<eos> We will!
There you are, my friend.<eos> Why can't I stay at the house? That's what I want to know.<eos> Number one, Hastings, you were not invited.<eos> A pure oversight.<eos> Number two, I need you at this stage incognito and very nearby.<eos> My incognito's gone, for a start.<eos> Why?<eos> Why is this?<eos> Well, the pub's so crowded, I'm having to share a room. And you'll never guess who with.<eos> No, Hastings, I will not.
Okay.<eos> Just as well.<eos> I'm late for choir practice as it is.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Hogwash.<eos> Beg pardon?<eos> What you were talkin' is hogwash.<eos> Nobody's gonna change the way things are.<eos> - But they will.
Death and loss are an integral part of life everywhere.<eos> Leaving him on Earth would not protect him.<eos> But the Earth won't be ordered to the Neutral Zone.<eos> My command sent his mother to her death.<eos> She understood her mission and my duty.<eos> Will he?<eos> In time... and with help.<eos> Wesley Crusher does.<eos> He does.<eos> And so will Jeremy.
Please, not a word about us.<eos> - About what?<eos> - About me and her, I don't want it.<eos> Has this thing been on for a while?<eos> - What thing?<eos> - Your relationship.<eos> It's not a relationship, this is the... first time we have a date.<eos> I wouldn't want to...<eos> - Will you close up, then?<eos> - Yes, I will.
But you're aware of Mr. Lo Fazio's interest... in acquiring the Splendor premises.<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> - Therefore, this offer...<eos> Cancellation of all documents signed by you up to this moment... and payment in your favor and in cash, of Mr. Lo Fazio's handwritten figure.<eos> What does minus 10 mean?<eos> That I accept the sum that Mr. Lo Fazio offers me, minus 10 million.<eos> I'll discount the 10 million.<eos> In exchange for a minor condition that you, as administrator, cannot... counsel against.<eos> - I say he won't accept it.<eos> - He will, he will.
But the real reason we're going is that I'm to marry an American, a lawyer in Baltimore.<eos> Quite Orthodox.<eos> Papa has arranged it.<eos> You're doing this to please your parents?<eos> Does it make any difference?<eos> I'm doing it.<eos> Oh, Leslie.<eos> There. I'll remember you always.<eos> I'll never forget you.<eos> Yes, you will.
Without fighter cover.<eos> We cannot afford the luxury of this leisurely launch.<eos> We have to forget about a coordinated attack.<eos> Squadrons will proceed to the target as and when airborne.<eos> Signal Commander McClusky to attack the enemy carriers immediately.<eos> Aye, sir.<eos> This is flag shelter.<eos> Release opening aircraft for strike.<eos> McClusky's going to need all the help he can get.<eos> So will he.
I'm sorry, Byron.<eos> I'm just too frightened for Louis.<eos> I know.<eos> Honey, don't worry.<eos> I've got 30 days leave.<eos> I'll wait for you.<eos> I'll check the embassy every day.<eos> I doubt I can book that honeymoon suite in Estoril.<eos> Try.<eos> I will.
You're offering us goods in exchange for our children.<eos> Why do you want them back?<eos> You can have more.<eos> You're trifling with our primal instincts.<eos> I must warn you that humans are willing to die for their children.<eos> Returning the children is non-negotiable.<eos> I promise you, they will have a beautiful life with us. And they'll be parents to a new breed born of an ancient culture.<eos> But how can you be sure that they can have children?<eos> You can't.<eos> But they will.
And it'd make the National Theatre really national.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I'm thinking of selling the National Theatre.<eos> - Selling it? - I knew you'd be pleased.<eos> - That way we can save? million on upkeep.<eos> - This is impossible!<eos> No, it's easy.<eos> We've had a terrific offer for the site.<eos> - The National Theatre must have a base.<eos> - And it will.
What about the theatres, the workshops?<eos> You could hire them.<eos> Put on productions in the West End or the Old Vic or provincial theatres.<eos> Become strolling players again - instead of... civil servants.<eos> - But that would be disastrous!<eos> Surely not.<eos> Didn't you say the theatre wasn't about bricks and mortar?<eos> Yes, yes, but that was...<eos> Look, the National Theatre must have a home!<eos> And so it will.
Here, here.<eos> - As chief cook, I assure you, no recipe is complete without...<eos> - Cyanide.<eos> See you in LA.<eos> Checkpoint, I'll get in touch with you.<eos> Bye.<eos> Be careful.<eos> - Thanks, little sister.<eos> Kill some pigs.<eos> - We will.
Forget everything I just said.<eos> Just forget everything.<eos> - Hey, Steven.<eos> - Yo!<eos> Could I talk to you?<eos> Step into my office.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Have a good show.<eos> - I will.
Vicki, you are my dream.<eos> Can't you...<eos> Haven't you noticed how people look at us when we dance together?<eos> They're looking at you.<eos> No, Vicki, they're looking at you.<eos> I mean... relax, we'll go to Puerto Rico.<eos> Positive.<eos> How could you be so sure?<eos> Well, if I told you, you would probably laugh.<eos> No, I won't.
Lucien, why are you being so difficult?<eos> You have people all over the island.<eos> Someone must have seen Christophe by now.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But what people see and what they say are very different matters.<eos> Haiti is full of contradictions, Dr Alan.<eos> These dancers, for instance, they don't bleed and they don't burn.<eos> Tonight we are calling down Erzulie, the goddess of love.<eos> - You will dance tonight?<eos> - No, Lucien, I will not.

- He really tried.<eos> - He acted the coward, I agree.<eos> But anyone can play the coward once.<eos> Many of us do, in fact, and you forget about it afterwards.<eos> It's just that in his case, it was so... spectacular.<eos> You mean he was unlucky.<eos> Everyone's tested at some point. It can happen any time.<eos> And then you discover what you've been all your life, what you are.<eos> Do you know what you are, really?<eos> But I will one day.
We'd been together for six years!<eos> What did I get finally?<eos> I felt like not knowing you and didn't even get any money<eos> I'm so poor that I had to borrow my mother's money for abortion!<eos> Speak up! What did I do for?<eos> Shut up!<eos> Since the day we'd met, you knew already what kind of person I am<eos> Don't stay with me if you want to marry want money<eos> Don't think that because you had abortion so secretly that I would feel sorry for all the rest of my life<eos> I won't!
Okay.<eos> Truce.<eos> Just give me a few minutes.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> It's horrible when there are tensions between employer and employee.<eos> Sometimes the pressures, they just build up.<eos> Wait till you get into a position of authority.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, you know, if I ever do.<eos> You will.
Harry!<eos> Are you sure you can't stay a Iittle longer?<eos> - I gotta get back home.<eos> - What's the rush?<eos> A Iot of things to do.<eos> I'm gonna fix that leak in the roof.<eos> It's gotta last me another 20 years.<eos> Another day.<eos> I still miss them.<eos> We always will.
What are you lookin' at, Julio?<eos> - It's okay. I'm a friend of your brother's.<eos> I'll see you downstairs.<eos> The Wire was my best friend.<eos> He was a great man. My brother was a criminal.<eos> Maybe he told you about me.<eos> Look, I have no interest in ever knowing any of my brother's friends.<eos> - You come from a world I wish never existed.<eos> - Well, you don't understand.<eos> I never will.
That never would have happened if he had his own room.<eos> Einstein had his own room.<eos> You think Einstein invented the theory of relativity in his wife's exercise room?<eos> No. He was in his own room with the door closed.<eos> Now, you make a decision, Steve.<eos> But make the right one.<eos> Remember, a man's castle is his pants.<eos> Why is it men always get what they want?<eos> Steve's not getting what he wants.<eos> He will.
- l'm not a little brat.<eos> - Tell me, little brat!<eos> Where are you taking that typewriter?<eos> Home.<eos> Put it down.<eos> It's ours. lt's my granny's typewriter.<eos> Don't answer back!<eos> Put it down!<eos> It belongs to my granny. I'm taking it away.<eos> No, you won't.
But if that had happened, I think that, there and then, I'd have lost interest in him.<eos> And now I've met someone with whom the very opposite happened.<eos> Feels good with me?<eos> - It's you and me? - Yes.<eos> Don't leave.<eos> I have to go, but I'll be back Monday.<eos> To leave again?<eos> Yes, but with you, if you want.<eos> If you don't change your mind.<eos> I never will again. You on?
You looked as good as the bride.<eos> Well, how sweet of you, Moody, to ask Josie to the wedding.<eos> You know, I was afraid you mightn't have been invited.<eos> Isn't she precious, Moody?<eos> You wore that sweet old dress to Fanny Emerson's wedding last year, though, didn't you, Anne?<eos> You know what they say, "Twice a bridesmaid, never a bride."<eos> That's three times a bridesmaid, not twice, Josie.<eos> But then you're so fortunate; the only thing you've ever had to wear twice is a sour expression.<eos> Now, don't you forget to save me a waltz.<eos> -I won't, Anne.
The guy said it's real rare.<eos> Somewhat rare.<eos> I think I'll keep my jam.<eos> The grub here is lousy.<eos> You're a real Jew.<eos> So, you're in love?<eos> Don't joke around.<eos> It's serious. Could you spare 50 francs?<eos> Women cost a bundle. You'll find out.<eos> No, I won't.
Why do you feel good around me? I don't know.<eos> Just good, that's it.<eos> Let's sit for a while in the gazebo.<eos> If we reason logically, a person is interested in oneself.<eos> But if we proceed not from the dead logic, but from the social one...<eos> - lskra. - Then perhaps...<eos> Are you going to get angry if I...<eos> What, Sasha?<eos> No, you will sure get angry.<eos> No, I won't.
But even bad mothers want their children to be happy.<eos> Enough of that talk. Go to bed.<eos> Tomorrow you'll have a hard day.<eos> Guys.<eos> Children.<eos> There'll be no classes today.<eos> The juniors may go home. The seniors...<eos> The senior pupils will accompany their comrade on her last journey, the 9 "B" student Victoria Lyuberetskaya, who has tragically died.<eos> You will have to answer for that.<eos> You will!
German is the bike.<eos> Entered in all bars instead of going to Saint Malo.<eos> "Let's get out of here.<eos> "Wait, I have an idea.<eos> - And now what?<eos> -Pinche wheels.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> I do not want to get into this.<eos> You can not see us and will have time to escape.<eos> I will not.
"Yes, ma'am.<eos> I want to say something.<eos> After the war we will laugh to remember this.<eos> But while ...<eos> I have to clean their shit.<eos> Mom,<eos> Will you rub my back as before?<eos> Do you, I'm tired.<eos> Mom, talk to me, please.<eos> I will not.
- Are you talking to me?<eos> - Get your feet down, and clean up the mess.<eos> The only reason you're still in one piece is because you're related to a friend of mine.<eos> But I'm warning you: Don't play smart ass with me.<eos> You got the picture?<eos> The only reason I'm in this horseshit- factory is because Moose wants in that way.<eos> But there ain't no one gonna tell me what to do.<eos> - It's obvious you take me for some idiot.<eos> - I don't know you that well, not yet.<eos> You will, kid. You will.
Excuse me...<eos> What was it that you want to show me?<eos> I wanted to show you these three dragons.<eos> The first is justice.<eos> The second is courage.<eos> The third is compassion and he's carrying a ball.<eos> I've staked my life on these three dragons.<eos> Please get out of my way!<eos> I'll do what I have to.<eos> You will, huh?
My husband'll bring it by train any minute.<eos> -l really have no room.<eos> We'll pay.<eos> Latif took 12 sacks of apples to market.<eos> - We'll have money.<eos> -Had I room I'd take it for free.<eos> My kids have nothing to sleep in.<eos> If it were smaller! What will I do with a couch?<eos> See what you can do.<eos> -l will.
- Relax, honey.<eos> With the notches you must have on your garter belt it was bound to happen.<eos> Oh, Rose.<eos> Rose, honey. Are you all right?<eos> I was booked.<eos> Fingerprints, mug shots.<eos> I'm a known criminal.<eos> I can't go back to my home town.<eos> - Nobody's ever gonna find out.<eos> - Oh, yes, they will.
- What Mr. Addison is trying to say is I had an idea.<eos> - You doing anything tonight?<eos> - She is going to the California Investigators Association annual banquet.<eos> - I am?<eos> - You am.<eos> - But I don't have a date.<eos> - You don't need a date.<eos> All you need's a ticket and something to wear.<eos> - Don't have that either.<eos> - But you will.
Rolled over and drooled on the sheet.<eos> And felt your hand pulling the quilt back up over me.<eos> That's who I started out.<eos> And this is who is left.<eos> So, that's what this is about.<eos> It's somebody I lost, all right my own self.<eos> Who I never was.<eos> Who I tried to be and never got there.<eos> Somebody I waited for and never came.<eos> And never will.
That was a rotten play.<eos> First I want the kitchen painted.<eos> You shake hands with her and introduce yourself.<eos> Don't squeeze!<eos> Normal.<eos> Not like a damp sponge. Normal, a normal handshake.<eos> Hello, I'm Abel.<eos> You see, there's nothing to it.<eos> And then you say something.<eos> - This evening, I will.
Phew! Hmm. Some scrap, huh?<eos> There are cats here.<eos> Wait till I tell Papa!<eos> If I find him.<eos> You see, he's looking for his family.<eos> Aw, the poor darling.<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> Honest John, at Tammany Hall.<eos> He'll know where your family is.<eos> He will?
Well?<eos> You can hang it up where you're going to. I mean, if you want to.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Better go. Brad?<eos> It's something over 400.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> I guess it's a rainy day.<eos> Thanks, grandma.<eos> - Take care of Terry, now.<eos> - I will.
Uh... if... I... don't... sign... faster... the hour will be over before I finish my opening speech.<eos> No. I'm all out of jokes.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm not funny.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> If you could hear, you'd think I was a scream.<eos> You're deaf?<eos> Well, I'll try to remember that.<eos> I'll forget?<eos> No, I won't.
No, he is in prison.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> I understand that you feel terrible,<eos> It's... it's all a mistake.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Ted says that it is the heltokigt mistake.<eos> We know, Ted, he is a fine young man.<eos> I will not. Thanks Dad.
I wish I had a hundred more like him.<eos> There is a house I want to buy.<eos> Let's just cut to the chase, okay?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want you to loan me $200,000 in cash.<eos> - You shout at me?<eos> - I shout at you!<eos> - I need that money, and you're gonna loan it to me!<eos> - I will not!<eos> - Yes, you will.
I count to three, you disappear.<eos> One, thanks for visiting.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> - Two... also, it was a pleasure meeting you, Alexandra.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> Three... good luck.<eos> You too, Turner.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> I never did see that damn trick done right.<eos> And you never will.
It's just what I've been warning you about.<eos> "Of making many books there is no end.<eos> Much study is a weariness of the flesh."<eos> Ecclesiastes.<eos> "There are many rooms in my Father's house, but I am the door."<eos> Don't slam it on the way out.<eos> May God forgive you.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will, Brother!
Where you going to put it?<eos> We'll probably sell it.<eos> -Do you want it?<eos> -I'd like it as soon as possible.<eos> In that case, you only need give me the information.<eos> Have you a box spring and mattress?<eos> Bedding's in the other department, but I can handle it for you.<eos> No, I would need a nice hard mattress and box spring. I'd like you to deliver it altogether.<eos> But you will want to select it.<eos> No, I won't.
A girl?<eos> I loved her and I married her.<eos> And one day she just split.<eos> Wait, this was Andie's mom?<eos> So I haven't seen her in three years, you know, and...<eos> But I still love her just as much as I ever did, you know?<eos> You can love Andie, but that doesn't mean she'll love you back.<eos> It doesn't mean she won't, but...<eos> What I'm trying to say is you can't make it happen.<eos> It either will or it won't.
- Kick him out!<eos> - I can't, he's got a gun!<eos> He won't taste heaven with you, slag!<eos> Ta, Pedro.<eos> Best of luck!<eos> I knew she was going to split. I felt it.<eos> Oh Monique, why are you deserting me?<eos> I'm here. I'll comfort you. We'll be good together.<eos> - You'll love me, won't you?<eos> - Of course I will.
United we're strong.<eos> I'll back after you have no fears, rest assured.<eos> What a pair we make.<eos> Any troubles you have, you can share them with me.<eos> Let's sit down and talk it over.<eos> If you need help, I'll be right here.<eos> At your beck and call.<eos> With you by my side. I'll never be afraid.<eos> United we're strong.<eos> I'll back after you.
30 years?<eos> You're already 32, bastard.<eos> Didn't you see your father before two years old?<eos> So you're father and son.<eos> Yes.<eos> But he knows better.<eos> Damn you!<eos> Are you trying to kill me?<eos> - Watch out, son.<eos> - I will, Daddy.
- A bowl of pellets and a handful of grain.<eos> Well, here she is.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Dr Ludlow has something he wants to talk to you about.<eos> I had not expected there to be a spectators.<eos> Perhaps you'd like to step over here?<eos> Benny, is this what I think it is?<eos> Yes, Carla. I want you to marry me.<eos> - Wow, what a day!<eos> - Well, will you?
If you can pick up a spare in the last frame, we'll be leading the tournament!<eos> Consider it done, Ma.<eos> Go to it.<eos> I did it! I did it! We're in the lead!<eos> We're gonna win! We're gonna win!<eos> We're gonna win!<eos> Rose, Rose, aren't you forgetting something?<eos> We haven't bowled our last frame yet.<eos> We can still win.<eos> And we will.
Kennedys have a problem, they call LaSalle.<eos> - Big deal.<eos> - When a big shot has a problem...<eos> - ...who do they call?<eos> - I don't care.<eos> Who calls us, David?<eos> - I'll have breakfast somewhere else.<eos> - Nobody, David.<eos> - Don't hurry.<eos> - I won't.
She died years ago... giving birth to my cousin Arthur.<eos> I haven't seen that little rat since he was a kid.<eos> - Mrs. Fletcher.<eos> - You have no idea where he might be?<eos> Yeah. He's dead too.<eos> At least, I'm pretty sure he is.<eos> I heard that a couple of years ago.<eos> You're looking at the last of a very distinguished line.<eos> Mrs. Fletcher, I don't think... you should be talkin' to the prisoner while he's in custody.<eos> Then I won't.
He says he must speak to you.<eos> It's quite important.<eos> Tell him I'll have to call him back.<eos> Look. I'm having a celebration tomorrow evening.<eos> It's our fifth anniversary.<eos> Please, would you come?<eos> I'd love to have you meet everyone.<eos> Oh, how kind.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I will.
I'm my own master now!<eos> And what about me, Durmishkhan?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll save some money and buy you out.<eos> Don't leave me!<eos> I'll get rich soon, and nothing will ever part us again.<eos> Let's go now.<eos> Let's dance for the Prince.<eos> - You'll never come back!<eos> - I will!
She knows I want John... on the throne, and I know she wants Richard... we are very frank about it.<eos> Henry, I can't be your mistress if I'm married to your son.<eos> Why can't you? Johnny wouldn't mind.<eos> I do not like your Johnny.<eos> He's a good boy. He's got pimples, and he smells of compost.<eos> He's just 16! He can't help the pimples.<eos> He could have a bath!<eos> It isn't such a dreadful thing to be queen of England.<eos> Not all eyes will weep for you.<eos> Will yours?
- How are you?<eos> -l'm fine.<eos> Happy patron saint day.<eos> Haven't you learned to cross yourself like an Orthodox yet?<eos> In the name ofthe Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.<eos> Aleksa used to teach me, but to no use.<eos> You Czechs, it's hard to change your ways.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Many have tried.<eos> - They won't anymore.
StarLight Amplification System.<eos> It amplifies available light a million times.<eos> Turns night into day.<eos> Oh, that's great, String.<eos> But now that the MiGs are gone, can't we go up just a little?<eos> Yeah, I guess we can ease up a few feet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, if they haven't snagged a snowdrift or been run over by a herd of reindeer, they should be approaching that cabin just about now.<eos> Then one way or another we should know what's happening soon.<eos> We won't, but they will.
Oh, my God.<eos> Bring the canteen in the port storage bin.<eos> Oh, easy, baby, it's over.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's gonna be all right.<eos> I was going to call, but Moffett...<eos> I know.<eos> I understand.<eos> I wanted to see the eagle.<eos> You will.
Rita?<eos> Rita.<eos> [ Rita Crying ] Oh, God.<eos> Rita, what is it?<eos> [ Rita Crying ] I can't take it anymore.<eos> He never stops.<eos> It's--<eos> [ Woman ] Do you want me to arrange the meeting?<eos> Oh, he'll know.<eos> He won't.
We have lessons.<eos> - Have you got used to the others?<eos> - School's all right.<eos> I hope you'll work hard and a credit to me, Juli deer.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I might.<eos> Don't know?<eos> It just willpower.<eos> Just keep trying.<eos> I will.
Yes.<eos> I'm overjoyed at seeing you. Know why?<eos> Why?<eos> Because you're young, not yet corrupted by the establishment.<eos> Not yet bored of teaching... Of the mediocrity of the exams, of the farce of grading.<eos> You're unspoiled, I can sense it.<eos> My intuition never fails me.<eos> What do you say?<eos> I'll like it here.<eos> You will.
(Hawke) Bring the canteen in the port storage bin.<eos> Oh, easy, baby, it's over.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's gonna be all right.<eos> I was going to call.<eos> But Moffet...<eos> I know.<eos> I understand.<eos> I wanted to see the eagle.<eos> You will.
Do you want me to beg on the streets?<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> - All they want to see is your work.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - What's wrong with that?<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Just shut up.<eos> One royal pupil, and all of Vienna will come flocking.<eos> They'll come anyway.<eos> - No, they won't.
Be there when they fly.<eos> I want them to be as free as possible.<eos> Nobody wants to be in a cage.<eos> How are you doing back there?<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah, just great.<eos> That is some piece of shit.<eos> Does it go?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But it will.
- It's Hymie!<eos> Would you hold this for me, please?<eos> I would like to really get a good look at that ring again.<eos> It's truly lovely.<eos> Oh my God... oh, look...<eos> - J.J., it's a vision.<eos> No, it's us.<eos> Oh, Sister Betty.<eos> - "Him" didn't know you had that in you.<eos> - "Him" will.
I busted my buns saving up for that shoe box.<eos> Took me a month.<eos> This is all I got left.<eos> Every cent. But I want to chip in to help.<eos> $3.68.<eos> That just about covers our fee.<eos> And if you fail, then things will be worse.<eos> They won't fail.<eos> I've seen what they can do.<eos> - They won't.
When he hears about dirty operations...<eos> - he goes animal, baby.<eos> Animal.<eos> - It won't wash.<eos> That teletype said that you were a military prisoner.<eos> And I'm the Sheriff.<eos> Besides...<eos> - you don't have any real proof.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> We will.
You erase the blot from our records and I'll be very pleased. GENERAL:<eos> Which means that others will be very pleased.<eos> Do what you have to do.<eos> Get me the A-Team.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Yeah, morning.<eos> Are you the only hot dog vendor here in the park?<eos> Do you see any other hot dog vendors?<eos> - Well, you won't.
And I shall call you "My Lord", My Lord.<eos> I like the cut of your jib, young fellow-me-lad.<eos> How'd you like to be my squire in the battle tomorrow?<eos> It will be a great day for we nobles.<eos> Not if we lose, Percy.<eos> If we lose, I'll be chopped to pieces.<eos> My arms will end up in Essex, my torso in Norfolk, and my genitalia in a tree somewhere in Rutland.<eos> With you at the helm, My Lord, we cannot lose.<eos> We could if we wanted to.<eos> Ah, but we won't, Percy.
- You're telling me!<eos> Sam, someday, you will realise that I am doing the right thing.<eos> Why do you always have to do the right thing?<eos> Do you see the rest of us doing it?<eos> We're happy.<eos> - May I go now?<eos> - Yeah, go on.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> By the way, just want to say, I'm glad that under all this pressure, we haven't seen that facial tic of yours.<eos> And you won't.
I'll miss you all very much.<eos> Bye, Diane.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Sorry, honey, I'm not interviewing till Monday.<eos> Get this straight.<eos> I'm going away with him.<eos> Good.<eos> Have fun.<eos> This could lead to marriage.<eos> Probably will.
I'm sureJudy won't mind sticking with me.<eos> I appreciate you going through with this charade, Steele.<eos> Main thing is that Retta not know.<eos> - Oh, of course.<eos> - I need your help.<eos> Someone is trying to kill me.<eos> How many strokes is that this hole? Twenty-two?<eos> Twenty-three.<eos> If we don't count the times you missed the ball.<eos> And we won't.
Jack was an alchemist.<eos> God, were we on fire.<eos> Then one morning, I woke up.<eos> The sun was shining.<eos> It was spring, and Jack was dead.<eos> Dead beside me.<eos> Dead in bed.<eos> That must have been when I started to smell bad.<eos> You've had quite a life.<eos> So will you.
Father... we entrust unto you... Dane... whom we loved so much in this life.<eos> Welcome him into Paradise... where there will be no more sorrow or pain... no more weeping... but only peace and joy with your Son... and with the Holy Spirit... forever...<eos> - And ever.<eos> - Amen.<eos> The Lord is merciful and kind... and rich in mercy.<eos> Man's days are like the grass.<eos> He flowers like the flowers of the field.<eos> The wind blows... and he is gone... and his place never sees him again.<eos> How will we live without him?<eos> We will.
If there come truth from them, as upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine, -<eos> why, by the verities on thee made good, may they not be my oracles as well, and set me up in hope?<eos> But, hush; no more.<eos> To-night we hold a solemn supper, sir, and I'll request your presence.<eos> Let your highness command upon me:<eos> to the which my duties are with a most indissoluble tie for ever knit.<eos> - Ride you this afternoon?<eos> - Ay, my good lord.<eos> Fail not ourfeast.<eos> My lord, I will not.
What do we need to wait for?<eos> What is it?<eos> I don't know. It's just... Sometimes, when I remember...<eos> Do you think Ed wouldn't have wanted this?<eos> You and me?<eos> No, that's just it.<eos> I'm sure he wouldn't mind.<eos> But that doesn't make it any easier.<eos> I loved him.<eos> I always will.
For instance, I wouldn't want to know you had a wife and kiddies... tucked away somewhere Or that you killed someone...<eos> When I invented Remington Steele... I gave him all the qualities that I admire in a man:<eos> honest, integrity, compassion... desire to help others.<eos> Sounds as if you're destined to be endlessly disappointed in me.<eos> Maybe I created an impossible role for anyone to play.<eos> We... have a very... tenuous relationship, you and I<eos> And if we ever cross that line... take that step... turn that corner...<eos> All those awful euphemisms for going to bed with someone...<eos> Then maybe I'll want to know... Everything.<eos> Then again, maybe I won't.
But it's they who've lost all hope.<eos> They think that when a person turns around... the world behind him ceases to exist... as if stolen by a thief.<eos> All right?<eos> I'll do it again.<eos> The censors will cut it out.<eos> - Maybe they won't notice.<eos> - Milosz?<eos> They've got butter and strikes on their minds right now.<eos> - The coast has stopped dead.<eos> - Just like your program will.
The situation's not bad.<eos> Is this place bugged?<eos> Probably.<eos> They're going on the offensive.<eos> Who is?<eos> You have too many friends who believe in tanks.<eos> - They'll never give in.<eos> - Yes they will.<eos> - This system won't last.<eos> - Yes it will.
It happened, but we can find a way out.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> I only wanted to set up at the plant... and find a nice place to live with you.<eos> Everything's gonna be all right.<eos> We'll hurry things up, no problem.<eos> Are you really happy?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I only want to live with you.<eos> And you will.
Everybody wants something from somebody.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Anything you got, Antonia.<eos> I've had apartments since I was eighteen years old, and this is the first time I've had exactly the woman I want in one of them, the very one.<eos> Boy, am I in love.<eos> You just come right out and say the corniest things, don't you?<eos> Sure do.<eos> What's worse is that I mean then.<eos> I'm afraid if I blink you might go away.<eos> Will you?
At what time will you be home?<eos> At eight.<eos> Hello there!<eos> Just getting up?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Remember to pick up the groceries.<eos> They promised to put them aside...<eos> Don't worry!<eos> -Don't forget!<eos> I won't.
- Barbara! - Oh, hi.<eos> I'll be with you in just a minute.<eos> There you go.<eos> All wrapped up.<eos> - Harvey!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I'm just going shopping with Carol.<eos> I'm gonna take Junior with me, OK?<eos> Listen, don't forget to pick up my stuff from the cleaner's.<eos> - No, I won't.
The way I smell my sweatshirt before I put it on.<eos> Sometimes we drive each other crazy.<eos> And then there are times we go through a period like the one we're in now.<eos> It comes over us like an unexpected wave. puppy love.<eos> I can't wait to see her.<eos> And then when I'm with her my heart beats faster.<eos> I'd expect it with somebody who's a stranger. but not somebody I've spent half my life with.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> I wish I could feel that.<eos> Oh. you will.
Full of noble principles but without the spirit to apply them.<eos> Sensibility and selfishness that feigns it. Pompous speeches and miserable experience.<eos> Some organizations are so susceptible that it would be difficult to believe in their truth.<eos> If I were to ask myself who I am, I would be in great difficulty.<eos> I am not to be believed; I cannot go any further than this.<eos> Yet this is not about me now, but about Fanny and her mystery.<eos> Let silence fall over that insane story that was her life, my sister's life with you, and perhaps it can still. be of some use.<eos> Fanny's mystery, you say!<eos> If indeed there was a mystery, let it reach a ripe age.<eos> Maybe it will a fecund subject, many years from now.
It's got everything to do with it.<eos> Then we'd better say goodbye.<eos> You've given me more than I've ever given you.<eos> You must really hate me.<eos> I mustn't come here anymore.<eos> Wait, I don't want you to go.<eos> Say something that will keep until you come back here.<eos> What shall I say?<eos> Say you'll never break it off between us.<eos> I never will.
Is there anything I could say to make you change your mind?<eos> I can't think of anything, but I'll give it a thought, I promise.<eos> Go ahead, let's get it over with.<eos> Get it over with?<eos> Okay, but I never intended to kill you.<eos> Oh, really, so what's that in your hand?<eos> This, it's empty, Mr. President.<eos> I can see his gun.<eos> I don't understand anything anymore!<eos> You will very soon, Mr. President.
Here they are.<eos> The folio.<eos> The oeuvre.<eos> Well...<eos> How is Jack?<eos> I do hope he's being more careful about what he's writing these days.<eos> I'd hate to see him not able to get into print.<eos> Oh, I'm sure he'll do fine.<eos> Did you tell him where we were having drinks?<eos> No, I will.
- Sorry.<eos> This good youth is coming too.<eos> I ve forgotten that you steal pictures too.<eos> Only for reasons of health.<eos> I feel better already.<eos> Something like acupuncture.<eos> - Somewhat similar.<eos> Our angel's life now lies in your hands.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> - You will.
Very often more than slightly.<eos> That's because it is insane to cling to honour in a world where honour is held in contempt.<eos> Sir, I don't know if I really deserve the rank of major.<eos> My first thought was for myself.<eos> I didn't think about the others or the school...<eos> - Sit down, Mr Moreland. - Sir.<eos> Never be ashamed of being human.<eos> Without humanity, a leader becomes a tyrant.<eos> I was relieved. I figured I had another year. I could graduate and go on to West Point.<eos> So you will. And the others too.
115?<eos> I've seen ten create a fearful momentum and you have over 100 here. With weapons.<eos> - And some really don't want to be here...<eos> - You saw the muster yesterday.<eos> - They had a chance to leave, they stayed.<eos> - 11 kids did leave.<eos> Sounds like 11 boys who weren't much good to us anyway.<eos> I don't care what happened here.<eos> I don't wanna see scared kids crawling over the wall in the middle of the night.<eos> You won't.
I knew straight you were an honest man.<eos> - Name?<eos> - Iron Idem.<eos> Ah, it's you!<eos> Yes.<eos> You always come up with something there in television.<eos> - Want to help yourself?<eos> - No. So will you register? !<eos> I will put on the record.<eos> I will.
- I haven't any.<eos> What for?<eos> You qualify for the Life Permit.<eos> I haven't any.<eos> I might give it to you anyway.<eos> You would stick it in later.<eos> But can one trust people?<eos> Sign here.<eos> - Will you stick it in?<eos> - Yes, I will.
I'll stab your stomach!<eos> You tramp!<eos> You're gonna set countries to war!<eos> I'll burn you!<eos> I'll do anything you want. Anything!<eos> -Here is what you are going to do...<eos> Instead of the tsarina, you'll sign that you accept me as a tsar.<eos> If you don't do that, you'll be dead.<eos> Your bones will rotten here.<eos> -I will!
You are an outlaw.<eos> It looks like you started to work somebody else.<eos> Yes.<eos> I work, but I don't work for you any more.<eos> You created Gingis Khan, Nero, Atilla.<eos> You are fed on slavery and hate.<eos> I want to live freely. It's over!<eos> I don't want to have anything with you!<eos> You will regret for this, Farfa.<eos> You will!
- You must do your best to stop a war.<eos> John, this is ridiculous.<eos> You say you're eons ahead of me and you want me to stop a war on a planet I know nothing about?<eos> - Why don't you stop it?<eos> - Apollo... I can't expect you to understand laws that transcend you by many generations.<eos> The simple truth is, I cannot be seen by the people of Terra outside the environment of this ship.<eos> I have no physical body as you know it.<eos> - What do you call that?<eos> - A reflection of intelligence.<eos> My spirit, if you will.
Listen, she's not mad at you.<eos> Maybe you could get her to...<eos> Sorry, you're not getting me involved.<eos> Apollo, look, I can't just leave it like this.<eos> Colonel, we're both going to the Celestra for a... maintenance scan.<eos> - What's wrong with your viper?<eos> - Same as Starbuck's.<eos> - Thanks, buddy.<eos> - I just hope it works out.<eos> It will.
Where is the control centre?<eos> Starbuck, erm...<eos> When Baltar captured you, you saw his base star.<eos> He knows.<eos> They didn't exactly give me the grand tour.<eos> Er, I do know the central core leads to all decks but I have no idea where Control Centre is.<eos> Make an educated guess.<eos> You know...<eos> I think your plan will work.<eos> It will?
Not for sure, I sure don't.<eos> Well it's gonna be all right, isn't it?<eos> Hell it'll be all right.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> What the hell's that?<eos> Is that that old... that new dress?<eos> That's that skirt that Jeanie and I bought, that they said it's too long so I'm hemming it up so you can see a little more of my leg.<eos> A little more leg, yeah.<eos> We're gonna look real snazzy, aren't we?<eos> We will.
You will have complete control.<eos> - But here in paragraph four...<eos> - Lawyer's quibbles, Doctor.<eos> Well, I've heard that before.<eos> Almost got me killed once, but of course you know that.<eos> Sign it.<eos> - Complete control.<eos> - My word.<eos> Well, I've signed so many things, one more won't make any difference.<eos> But it will, Doctor. It will.
And Ann Berry.<eos> And it all points to Turvey.<eos> Only circumstantially.<eos> Ah, knock it off, Ray.<eos> You're not in the Force now.<eos> In this outfit, a hunch is a hunch- -is a hunch is a hunch is a hunch.<eos> I know.<eos> I've nicked villains before and had 'em slip through my fingers, and then watched 'em stick two fingers up at me from the dock.<eos> What we've got on Turvey won't hold up in court.<eos> It will eventually.
Pink, sir.<eos> It's the in shade.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> What I particularly did not want was bold stripes!<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Yeh?<eos> They think they've got a touch.<eos> A what?<eos> Well, they've more or less eliminated twenty--<eos> Just a, just a minute, will you.
You look glum.<eos> Anyway it's gonna go back to the big bosses and... it'll surely be put down.<eos> What did we finally try to say in this little video film?<eos> Anyway, it'll be put down.<eos> It won't.<eos> It will, i tell you it will.<eos> I know them, it will.<eos> I tell you it won't.<eos> No need to worry.<eos> It won't.
- Commissar, we're going to attack!<eos> - First I'll take a look at the Baron's.<eos> - You might as well get your funeral organized!<eos> Not necessary.<eos> If he's sure I'm here, he won't be expecting me.<eos> - You're going to split in half?<eos> - Sort of.<eos> You'll be the first half.<eos> - I'd rather stay in one piece.<eos> - But you will.
You wanna take a look?<eos> Yes.<eos> Can I go up?<eos> Of course.<eos> But we don't have much floor yet, so be careful.<eos> It's cute looking.<eos> Jimsy, is that a piglet's room?<eos> Yes.<eos> I hope he'll like this place.<eos> Sure he will.
I tell you, if she comes in, tiger, And I'm gonna be 1,500 in front, And you'll be licking mackerel fillet.<eos> Did you forget my beer or did I drink it already? Never mind, I'll get it.<eos> I'll try to get rid of him. Wait a minute.<eos> Did you hear what he said, Frank?<eos> If Sweet Jake finishes first, he wins $1500. So?<eos> So if Link can win $1500, Why can't we win 120,000?<eos> No, no, no. Wait a minute.<eos> He just made a bet. He could win 1500.<eos> It doesn't mean he will.<eos> With me on his side, he will.
Yes?<eos> I know you did, Mrs. Merkle.<eos> Mr. Peckinpaugh?<eos> No, he hasn't come in yet.<eos> You have a visitor in there, a Miss Sophie DeVega.<eos> - Pretty?<eos> - Prettier than me, but I'm easier.<eos> I'm saving you for the rainy season.<eos> Yes, Mrs. Merkle, I'll tell him you called.<eos> I will.
None of that stuff.<eos> There's too many rules.<eos> You're just a regular Tank Murdock.<eos> - You know him?<eos> - I know of him.<eos> He's from Denver and he's a regular institution.<eos> You bet he is.<eos> Now that is one guy I'd like to meet up with.<eos> Well, I'd really like to meet Clyde.<eos> And you will.
Page him again.<eos> Never mind.<eos> I think he`s here.<eos> Things must`ve gotten pretty kinky with Ellen last night.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I've gotta go talk to Ann.<eos> Later. The meeting`s started.<eos> All right, I'll go change.<eos> You pay the taxi back there.<eos> Will you, please?
They're starting the last count.<eos> One, two,<eos> three...<eos> I don't hear nothing.<eos> Oh, Gloves!<eos> Seven, eight,<eos> nine...<eos> I love you, Gloves.<eos> I always did.<eos> I always will.
You will give me a name some day. And I live in terror of that day.<eos> - Why speak so mysteriously?<eos> I am happy in your company.<eos> Give me your hand!<eos> I want to touch you.<eos> - No!<eos> - We torment each other.<eos> You have never dined with me.<eos> Never drank a toast with me.<eos> Will you now?
150.<eos> h, my God.<eos> Losing respiration.<eos> First sign, respiratory arrest.<eos> Doctor.<eos> Walter.<eos> h, Walter.<eos> There it is.<eos> I just don't understand your request.<eos> - You will. You will.
No, it doesn't. I don't take Phil that seriously either.<eos> Oh, I think you're serious about Phil.<eos> Mom, I'm still a virgin, if that's what you meant.<eos> It's not what I meant.<eos> But I'm glad you told me.<eos> - I just meant that you like Phil.<eos> - I like Phil.<eos> I'm not gonna marry him.<eos> I'm never getting married.<eos> - You will.
And this is Claire and Fred and Allison and Elaine and Hal.<eos> - Hal.<eos> I'm Hal. - Fred.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - How are you?<eos> Glad to know you.<eos> - Can we have lunch next week?<eos> - Yeah. I'll call you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I will.
What am I supposed to do with it?<eos> I work in a book store, for Christ's sake.<eos> You're supposed to hold on to it.<eos> Your Johnny's made some new friends.<eos> You're a couple of marks, you and John.<eos> What do you mean, marks?<eos> The people you're dealing with are going to see that right away.<eos> What people?<eos> I don't know who you're talking about.<eos> You will.
Stanfield!<eos> Know you're there!<eos> Stanfield!<eos> I know you're there.<eos> - Stanfield!<eos> - What is playing, Father?<eos> You will not turn a heart humble and contrite.<eos> God, forgive me.<eos> - Have mercy on me.<eos> - not the will.
I want my chance to rule, and rule Rome as it should be ruled.<eos> If you love me, give me that chance.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I should have known that would be your answer.<eos> Well. so be it.<eos> I've done all I could.<eos> You shall have your wish. May the gods protect you.<eos> Britannicus.<eos> Perhaps you will confound the prophecies.<eos> Yes. Perhaps you will
I swear to you I won't do it again.<eos> Yes, well, let's not be in too much of a hurry to swear anything.<eos> My dear, I must talk to you like a grown woman now.<eos> Can I talk to you?<eos> Can I open my heart to you?<eos> Oh, yes, Grandmother, yes.<eos> Many years ago, before you were born, we all went through the terrible agony of civil war.<eos> Rome tottered and shook and nearly fell.<eos> I'm afraid that may happen again.<eos> And will it?
Insults and humiliation make me strong.<eos> They make me strong. Italy is only my master.<eos> I only serve her, that's why we marched on Rome.<eos> The rich exploit and sack us.<eos> The more they eat the more rotten they get.<eos> We get the leftovers, but they make us strong.<eos> Alfredo Berlinghieri, you and all the other parasites<eos> will pay dearly for the Fascist revolution.<eos> You will pay for it!<eos> Everybody will!
Thank you, Mr. Bernstein.<eos> Tomorrow it should be better.<eos> I guess so.<eos> Mr. Dardis' office.<eos> Hi. Please tell Mr. Dardis that Mr. Bernstein has just left.<eos> He'll be available all day tomorrow.<eos> I think we can probably squeeze him in around 4:30.<eos> Yes.<eos> And please tell Mr. Dardis that he doesn't want to be late for his 6:30 appointment.<eos> - Yes, I will.
We must find out how the robots operate and how to fight them.<eos> - We can't do it without Agapit.<eos> - Where did they hide him?<eos> We must find Agapit, or we'll never get out of here.<eos> - Let's disguise ourselves as robots.<eos> - How?<eos> We have a weapon<eos> - A and B.<eos> - It won't help.<eos> - It will.
Any other time I would advise clemency.<eos> But it's against my policy!<eos> Change your policy.<eos> England dislikes leniency.<eos> You want that mitre!<eos> Yes, it's true... and I do get money from England.<eos> But having an English alliance has made France richer too.<eos> They say money has no religion.<eos> Money is Protestant, so 4 Catholic heads must fall.<eos> But they won't.
Been leading me, like a thread, throughout the world.<eos> Marousia?<eos> And the children?<eos> Where are the children?<eos> I'm going to tell everybody that you've stolen the book.<eos> - What?<eos> - I will, you'll see.<eos> - Now stop it!<eos> - Go on, tell everybody!<eos> I will, anyway!
It would have helped if we'd known what had become of you.<eos> Didn't you think of writing to your mother?<eos> Of course.<eos> But the shame I felt of losing her money my father's sword and pistols...<eos> I couldn't tell her.<eos> She wouldn't care about those things.<eos> You are her only concern.<eos> Tonight you must write her a proper letter.<eos> Tell her that you're safe and well.<eos> I will.
I intend to see that Governor Fairchild stands trial for murder.<eos> Major Claremont.<eos> Deakin must have got to him.<eos> Where in God's name can they be?<eos> In the supply wagon.<eos> We've looked everywhere else.<eos> Find 'em and kill 'em. Both.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I want to see those rifles.<eos> - You will.
I can't believe it.<eos> I'm married to F.Q. Biggerd, the millionairess.<eos> She's not a millionairess, you ass.<eos> Didn't her mother leave her something?<eos> Wait.<eos> It'll come to me.<eos> No, it won't.
His wife has been taken.<eos> It's for a bribe.<eos> Oh... You are impossible.<eos> Now hear...<eos> I will take care of it.<eos> Now will you please go to bed ?<eos> But Willem and Tine are coming.<eos> - You can come down later.<eos> - Be sure to call.<eos> I will.
About 100 yards, south, southwest.<eos> - That's Ben Gardner's boat.<eos> - You know him?<eos> It's all banged up.<eos> Sure I know him.<eos> He's a fisherman.<eos> What happened?<eos> I got to go down there and check their hull.<eos> Wait. Why don't we just tow it in?<eos> We will.
Didn't Trout tell you you're supposed to strip?<eos> I'm a singer!<eos> Listen.<eos> Listen, listen, listen.<eos> Go finish the show like you told Trout you'd do, and I'll set it up so you can sing at the Parthenon.<eos> You can sing in the Parthenon with Barbara Jean.<eos> - Go finish the show...<eos> - I get to sing with Barbara Jean?<eos> Yes, you are...<eos> Yes, you will.
Here the Americans are manufacturing a new bomb sight.<eos> It's called the Norden bombsight.<eos> If they manage to incorporate this into the Allied bombers... they will be able to pinpoint targets... from an altitude far beyond the effective range of our anti-aircraft.<eos> Destroy this one factory... and it will put them behind at least a year... in their war effort.<eos> At the same time that you are bombing the Brooklyn Navy Yard... one of our agents in Washington... will be stealing the only duplicate set of plans for the bomb sight... thus completely destroying their production capability.<eos> Of course, your timing must be flawless.<eos> It will be, Herr Oberst.<eos> I had hoped to undertake this mission myself, but unfortunately... the Führer wishes me to be right here by his side.<eos> If you fail...<eos> I will not, Herr Oberst.
I took up a lot of your time. Sorry.<eos> - Not at all.<eos> I should apologize. Listen.<eos> Who, in your opinion, had the motive for killing Garrone? For real and not for fun.<eos> - For real?<eos> I shall look at the issue in depth.<eos> But let me think about it a bit. And I'll call you as soon as possible. Alright?<eos> Goodbye.<eos> So, will my son be released, Sir?<eos> Yes, he will.
I'm always losing them.<eos> It's you, inspector.<eos> - Good morning!<eos> Already at work?<eos> - I got up early after a sleepless night.<eos> Worries? - The heat!<eos> People should leave this city.<eos> My gardener has already done so.<eos> Don't tell me you were just passing by?<eos> - I won't.
You are trembling.<eos> You have strong hands.<eos> And a gentle face.<eos> Kwai Chang let me stay with you tonight.<eos> I could be anything you want.<eos> I will try to honor you, to please you.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Do not ask why.<eos> - You do not love me.<eos> - I will.
That's what I wanted to hear!<eos> - Look!<eos> Look what I found!<eos> - What?<eos> - Kraik, now, take it easy now,<eos> Come on.<eos> That's not gonna solve anything.<eos> If you eat all the food now, what about tomorrow?<eos> I'm hungry now, I don't care about tomorrow.<eos> But you will... tomorrow.
Commies going that far.<eos> And how did Sean Kelly's lady friend react?<eos> Cagey.<eos> She said he was out of the country and asked me to come back next week.<eos> To check up on you.<eos> How is Major Tarrant's cover?<eos> We gave him the name of one of our ghosts on the army list, Sir Edward,<eos> George Lampton, who was cashiered for passing dud cheques and served part of his time in prison while Kelly was there.<eos> - What happens when Kelly comes back?<eos> - He won't.
I think you've met.<eos> Sir, could I see you a moment?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> You're not being reasonable.<eos> Your disorderly methods had disappeared from Marseilles.<eos> With a man like you... we could see eye to eye.<eos> Big changes are underway.<eos> But you wanted to see me.<eos> Will you say why?<eos> I will.
- You're not making a bit of sense.<eos> - Let's look at it this way:<eos> Mulwray didn't want to build a dam.<eos> His reputation was hard to get around.<eos> You decided to ruin it.<eos> Then he found out you were dumping water at night.<eos> Then he was... drowned.<eos> That's an outrageous accusation.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Well, Whitey Mehrholtz over at the Times will.
Here's your coffee.<eos> I'll get the sugar.<eos> Wait for me.<eos> - Something else?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> Passengers for Lyons, boarding now.<eos> Fasten your seat belts.<eos> Your Honor, I understand that a son wouldn't want to see his father in this kind of situation, but can't a father see his son?<eos> You will, Mr. Descombes.
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I was too scared myself.<eos> Enough now!<eos> Did you hear about the Russians?<eos> I never listened.<eos> I was too scared.<eos> Mischa!<eos> What?<eos> My parents will live with us.<eos> They certainly will not.
May I go with some friends to a village?<eos> It is far?<eos> A few miles.<eos> Can I take Jose's bike?<eos> Be careful with it.<eos> No passangers... and be back by 8.<eos> What if the others want to stay late?<eos> They can do as they like.<eos> You be here at 8.<eos> I will
God, Bowie, you make me look like 30 cents.<eos> And what the hell do the papers do all the time but print about you all the goddamn time?<eos> It rips my guts out.<eos> Take you, and on top of that, that damn puny, little Picayune girl that ain't never seen the outside of a filling station, and by God the papers do but print about you all the time.<eos> I tell you, it rips my...<eos> What the hell we stop here for, Bowie?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Come on, you son of a bitch, get out.<eos> What the hell you talking about, "Get out"?<eos> I will not!
You won't figure it out in a million years, Slim.<eos> - How do I know you ain't running a game?<eos> - My word is my rep.<eos> But, of course, if you didn't hit Madame Zenobia's last Saturday night... then the whole thing is academic.<eos> You got a deal.<eos> We'll meet in a neutral place.<eos> I'll let you know where, when I call you and tell you what time.<eos> I'll be there with three of my boys, and you show up with three of yours.<eos> - Look to see you around.<eos> - You will.
And the third parachute brigade amateur dramatic society For "the oscar wilde sketch."<eos> My congratulations, wilde.<eos> Your latest play is a great success.<eos> The whole of london's talking about you.<eos> There is only one thing in the world<eos> Worse than being talked about And that is not being talked about.<eos> Very, very witty, very, very witty.<eos> There is only one thing in the world Worse than being witty, and that is not being witty.<eos> I wish I had said that.<eos> You will, oscar, you will.
- We are different.<eos> But I don't want you to suffer when I don't.<eos> I am glad that you think that way.<eos> Viki, just try to love me as I love you, simply and sincerely.<eos> - We are sisters, aren't we?<eos> - Let's forget it.<eos> All this talking leads nowhere.<eos> I want to know if you are coming to the Green Flute, now that the house is going to be repaired.<eos> No.<eos> - You won't?
Her physician, Dr Mayer, confided in a friend of his that he considers her illness highly peculiar.<eos> You have been misinformed.<eos> My sister's illness is only a slight indisposition.<eos> Your orders were quite precise.<eos> You asked for a poison that acts slowly, and for the one who drinks it to die later without a cause that could be established by an autopsy.<eos> Those were your words.<eos> We made a note of them.<eos> You asked for a tasteless, odourless liquid. Isn't that the truth?<eos> - I fail to understand.<eos> - You will, soon.
He starts acting out... drinking and taking all kinds of drugs.<eos> At the end, the boy kills himself by jumping over a bridge.<eos> The second story was pretty much the same as the first... except, at the end, the boy kills himself by drinking a bottle of bug poison.<eos> Your stories are intense.<eos> I just want to leave some kind of legacy. Something great.<eos> And after that, I don't care what happens to me.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I wish there was a story about me.<eos> I don't know who would read it, though.<eos> I would.
What are you planning to do with your life, lgby?<eos> Just kill time until--<eos> My nervous breakdown comes along?<eos> Is your father dead?<eos> No, why?<eos> 'Cause when I talked about mine, you didn't feel obligated to compare and contrast.<eos> He's a theologian.<eos> A Jewish theologian and a metaphysical poetess.<eos> Doesn't explain you.<eos> What would?
-The truth?<eos> I don't want to lose Brita over this.<eos> The thought of moving out... spending my time profiling unsuspecting women.<eos> do what, and start dating again?<eos> How does that age?<eos> I mean, it's so sad.<eos> Have nobody to share my life with.<eos> This is the most gay I've ever felt in my life.<eos> If you were gay you wouldn't have this problem.<eos> -I would.
And whatever you do, do not be yourself.<eos> Just joking.<eos> I can do it.<eos> Hi. My name's Jimmy Tong.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Pretty colors.<eos> Will you excuse me for just one moment?<eos> Just between us guys... you don't come around here for the art, do you?<eos> Who would?
It progresses.<eos> - Well?<eos> We try to...<eos> Given that we are understaffed at the moment.<eos> I intend to run both Cases in parallel within the team.<eos> So you take the woman found at Beck Holmen Alice will take Vansömordet and I...<eos> - Should she be leading an investigation?<eos> - Yes, I think so.<eos> Do you have a problem with that?<eos> - No. Why would I?
How long were you there?<eos> A colleague suspected... and... cruise Next to me was... and here I am.<eos> My God!<eos> I wanted to kill you for real?<eos> I wanted out of life because he has another lover.<eos> Is with him now?<eos> I do not know.<eos> What is happening here?<eos> Just know that when tried to kill me... had intentions of continue the romance.<eos> With whom would the novel?
I think it's that annoying girl from the shop.<eos> - I'll go.<eos> - No, I'll go.<eos> Mom, be careful, she's suspicious.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> - That's all I needed!<eos> - Uncle?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Would you like to be my father?<eos> - Yes, I would.
Open Hearts<eos> Would you like a sweet?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> Not at all?<eos> What's up?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just thought maybe you'd like a sweet.<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
I'm just trying to make a connection.<eos> The more I come to places like this, the harder it gets.<eos> What are you looking for in here?<eos> I honestly don't know. I'll know it when I see it.<eos> Would you?<eos> - I'm sorry, forget it.<eos> I was gonna ask if you wanted to go someplace more quiet.<eos> I have to stay here.<eos> Right.<eos> - I would....
- A river is the best way.<eos> - Would you throw her in a river?<eos> You see, in the movies they get the body and check the DNA... I think in Brazil that won't happen!<eos> Imitating "Shallow Grave"... I would cut the hands and feet...<eos> It 's so complicated, cutting a body.<eos> No, no cutting.<eos> Just burning.<eos> Set fire on her, throw acid to burn it all.<eos> L'd burn her.<eos> L really would.
- She was alive.<eos> So you're idiots!<eos> To see if the person's dead, you check the pulse first.<eos> Did they check it?<eos> L think her heart is not beating!<eos> And was she dead?<eos> You were desperate.<eos> She's burning, but alive.<eos> L'd let her burn. And you?<eos> L wouldn't!
You hated the name Ruth. Why would you change your mind?<eos> Unless you know we're never gonna have to use it.<eos> You did see.<eos> You know it's a boy!<eos> I didn't see anything.<eos> I actually changed my mind about the name.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You're giving me Ruth.. so you get to name him when it's a boy.<eos> That's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.<eos> I would.. Sequoia!
- What?<eos> - That.<eos> The Jordan almond you pulled out of your pajama top and ate.<eos> - Where did you get it?<eos> - Santa Claus.<eos> All right, the piano movers will be here at 8:00... and the chairs will be set up at 9:00.<eos> All the rooms are made up and ready.<eos> I will be in at 10:00.<eos> I am going home, unless you want me to stay.<eos> Actually, I would.
- Definitely.<eos> Wise.<eos> - All right, babes.<eos> - See you later.<eos> See you later.<eos> We're off on our date.<eos> It's not a date. I'm paying her.<eos> What sort of date is that?<eos> And £100. what would I get for that?<eos> Not that I would.
- What penis?<eos> ! - There's nothing funny!<eos> Ok, then<eos> Time to see if this stud horse is worth what you paid for him<eos> Come on now, Lamar<eos> Now, Lamar, when you get out there take your time<eos> You're not in a hurry You don't care<eos> That's how I'd play it, at least<eos> Although I'd probably wear pants<eos> No, I wouldn't!

She lost a child.<eos> If she was looking for an escape... she'd probably pick somebody that was completely separate from her real life.<eos> - Is that from your Infidelity Handbook?<eos> - Chapter 3.<eos> I hate to contradict the book, but if you're wrong... it leaves Duncan plenty of motive.<eos> Agent Malone, I would like it to be noted... that my client is cooperating fully in this investigation.<eos> Apart from hiding every crucial piece of information... your client has been very cooperative.<eos> We'll be sure to make a note of that.<eos> Now, Mr. Muller... I would really like to believe that you have nothing to do with this.<eos> I really would.
You need her blood?<eos> When I'm through there won't be enough to fill a bottle cap.<eos> - Then you, Hell bitch, have nowhere left...<eos> - To go.<eos> You can't hurt her and you know it, Ben.<eos> I know it because I feel what you're feeling.<eos> Scared.<eos> It's OK.<eos> You don't wanna die.<eos> Who would?
You either do zero pumps or a thousand pumps.<eos> I don't know how I did it.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> What did you summon?<eos> I don't know how I did it.<eos> If I stopped at 1 2 pumps, I would tell my wife.<eos> I'd go home and say, "Honey, I was getting a massage...<eos> "and I took 1 2 pumps and I stopped 'cause I love you."<eos> -l will never ever tell her.<eos> -l would.
You don't strike me as lacking self-esteem.<eos> Well, just wait and see.<eos> This time tomorrow, I'll be a shadow of my former self.<eos> I think you're exaggerating.<eos> We're talking about a woman here so self-involved and insecure that she used to borrow my clothes and hit on my boyfriends.<eos> She's like a menace to society, an enemy of daughters everywhere.<eos> Brace yourself, Jo. Something wicked this way comes.<eos> -Dawson hasn't called, has he?<eos> -Like I would forget to tell you.<eos> Okay. Right, I probably would.
I gave her the only key!<eos> I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship!<eos> -Why did you give her a key?<eos> -She talked me into a corner, okay?<eos> She's like this conversational wizard.<eos> So you had the conversation you didn't wanna have.. and you made the gesture you didn't wanna make.<eos> Did I start this by saying, "Hey, I did something awesome today"?<eos> -Do either of you have a key to my place?<eos> -I don't think you've ever given us keys.<eos> Yeah, why would I?
When do you think I should go in there?<eos> I'd wait a couple of hours till we have some more facts.<eos> You'll talk to the sheriff's office and I guess, the DA.<eos> Yeah, but you don't want to walk too far into that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - You heard?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - C.J. thinks I should wait a few hours.<eos> - I would. - Okay.
Come with me for a second, would you?<eos> It's possible you're gonna hear stuff about seat belts today.<eos> - I urge you to ignore it.<eos> - No problem.<eos> You straightening things out with the Smithsonian?<eos> I'm to speak at an exhibit marking the 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor but a small veterans' group objects on the grounds that it's America-bashing.<eos> - I thought you liked America-bashing.<eos> - I wouldn't say that.<eos> - What would you say?<eos> - I wouldn't.
- Shut up, Byers!<eos> - Shoot him!<eos> Shut up!<eos> I'm not gonna shoot him.<eos> - He needs help!<eos> - I don't need help.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Tracy would want you to get help.<eos> - She would?<eos> - Yes, she would.
And you can also tell jokes.<eos> - So, you thought it was funny?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> -The joke.<eos> You laughed, didn't you?<eos> Yep, very funny. Very, very funny!<eos> What's it that you're watching?<eos> - The News.<eos> So, you'd like to be well informed?<eos> Why? And you wouldn't?
I honestly don't know.<eos> I'll know it when I see it.<eos> Would you?<eos> - I'm sorry, forget it.<eos> - What?<eos> I was gonna ask if you wanted to go someplace more quiet.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to stay here.<eos> Right.<eos> - I would....
- Hey, hi. - Yes.<eos> - Do you see something you like?<eos> - I'm married.<eos> - That's allowed.<eos> I just I need ...<eos> I need some ... A Christmas present.<eos> For your wife?<eos> Yes, of several years. We're ... Yes.<eos> - You want some lingerie for your wife?<eos> - Yes, I would.
That can happen near the end.<eos> Just get the book.<eos> -Get the book!<eos> -The book!<eos> -The Bible?<eos> -I don't know!<eos> All right. This is great.<eos> You get behind the desk.<eos> When she comes in, she won't recognize you because<eos> Well, why would she?
So you think that the real traitor discovered that your father was onto him... and framed him.<eos> But no one believes me.<eos> I believe you.<eos> [Young Sydney On Monitor] I want you to tell me what's wrong... with each of these pictures.<eos> [Jarod] The chimney's missing there. The door's upside down there.<eos> The fence is missing a post there... and the address numbers are inverted there.<eos> Look closer, Jarod.<eos> [Jarod] The sun's shadow off the wood stack... it's misdirected in all of them.<eos> - I missed it.<eos> - Most people would, Jarod.
- Hi Mr. Mackee.<eos> - Are you boys staying' out of trouble?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Ok, I, I'm just gonna go over here for a while.<eos> Anyways, I need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize Ike is gone.<eos> - Knock it off asshole. - No way!<eos> I'm never going back to your parents house.<eos> Come on dude, if it were your little brother we'd help you.<eos> Ehh. Wait a minute!<eos> No you wouldn't!
- To failure.<eos> - l'm not drinking to that.<eos> Jake, in ten minutes, my business partner's ship will dock.<eos> In 15 minutes, Odo will arrest him.<eos> In 20 minutes, my name will come up.<eos> And in 25 minutes, Odo will walk in here with a warrant.<eos> You should humour me on this one.<eos> Quark.<eos> I'd like that holosuite now, after all.<eos> - You would?
Howard Grodin.<eos> Mr. Grodin, this is Special Agent Fox Mulder of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<eos> - How are you this morning?<eos> - How did you get this number?<eos> Well, frankly, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> Sir, I am obligated to tell you that you have a security leak in your facility.<eos> A man with whom you've worked very closely has contacted this office on several occasions and offered me access to highly classified information.<eos> - Would you happen to have a name for this man?<eos> - Why, yes.<eos> Yes, I would.
Let's find....<eos> How do you feel about selling Miss Parker's contract?<eos> Miss Parker has no contract.<eos> -No-- Oh, what are we waiting for?<eos> -l don't know. What are you waiting for?<eos> Miss Parker's free to work for me if she wants?<eos> Miss Parker'd be free to work for you if she wanted to whether she'd signed a paper or not.<eos> You don't understand people working together that way, do you?<eos> -No, I don't.<eos> -No, you wouldn't.
I'll watch your ball.<eos> You're on the fairway.<eos> Wrong fairway, but you're in the fairway.<eos> I think it's this whole doctor-golf clich Á that's really throwing me.<eos> You can't fight it.<eos> Play nine holes twice a week and 18 on the weekends.<eos> You'll be in the low 80s by Labor Day.<eos> Dr. Benton, I see you have a thymectomy scheduled.<eos> Would you mind if I gave it to Dr. Levin?<eos> Yes, I would.
Look.<eos> Very interesting, Phoebe.<eos> What's this?<eos> The licorice room.<eos> You can eat all the furniture.<eos> When guests come over, they can stay on the Tootsie Roll-away bed.<eos> This is the coolest house ever!<eos> Does anyone want to join me in the Aroma Room?<eos> - All right.<eos> - I would.
I know who he truly is and as long as I keep that image I can think the truth.<eos> But no one else knows him.<eos> Somehow he has brainwashed the entire country into thinking that John Doe is a "darn nice guy."<eos> Honey. Honey, we believe you.<eos> It just doesn't seem like Clark is dead.<eos> Maybe he can be found.<eos> If I haven't learned anything else in this life I've learned you have to cling to hope.<eos> - That's what Clark would say.<eos> - Hello?<eos> Yes, he would.
He's almost done.<eos> [Sydney] Real glutton for punishment, hmm?<eos> Desperate times, desperate measures, Sydney.<eos> If Sponge Boy here really can become anyone, like all the quacks around here claim... then I'm letting him become Kyle and Jarod at the same time.<eos> - Maybe he'll tell me where they went.<eos> Maybe we should have tethered him.<eos> Aren't we making one erroneous assumption, Dr. Parker?<eos> What's he gonna blow? A transistor?<eos> - You assume that he wants to help you.<eos> - Why wouldn't he?
Including yours, Sabrina?<eos> It's too early to tell, but there's a chance that for the rest of my life, I will fear math. I will sweat every time I have to calculate a tip.<eos> I will put off balancing my chequebook.<eos> I will play blackjack, but I will not understand it.<eos> If you understood it, you wouldn't play it.<eos> Thank you. You may step down.<eos> Counsellor, are there any other witnesses?<eos> The people rest.<eos> Would the defendant like to make a closing statement?<eos> Yes, I would.
They say the eye is the window to the soul.<eos> In this case, it's a little bit more.<eos> I fabricated this artificial organ to replace her eyepiece, but I've had to retain some of the Borg circuitry along the optic nerve.<eos> As a result, she'll have increased acuity in one eye.<eos> Note how perfectly I've matched the pigment of the iris to her human eye.<eos> Excellent work, Doctor. I admire your attention to detail.<eos> When can I speak with her?<eos> She's out of immediate danger and I don't plan to resume the extraction process until tomorrow.<eos> I can wake her now if you'd like.<eos> I would.
- No, she's too smart for that.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> She just meant to throw them off.<eos> She said she wanted to go public.<eos> The Baltimore Guardian is only a couple of blocks down from the train station.<eos> Susanne!<eos> John.<eos> They didn't believe my story.<eos> Not a word of it.<eos> Who in their right mind would?
- The fantasy of a killer.<eos> She's completely non-responsive.<eos> We did a tox screen and found traces of morphine and scopolamine.<eos> - Twilite Sleep.<eos> - The dental anesthetic?<eos> A painkiller cocktail.<eos> It's also for women in labor.<eos> - Would that account for her condition?<eos> - No.<eos> What would?
If he stays with me, he'll become a target for all those who hate me..., ...and he'll learn things a child should never know.<eos> He'll become like me.<eos> The son of Borias will be raised as my own.<eos> I want to talk to you.<eos> I told you everything.<eos> Yeah, now you've told me everything... Everything except why.<eos> I mean... How could you walk out on your own child?<eos> You don't understand.<eos> No, I do understand.<eos> Any woman would.
I know.<eos> It was Dagon.<eos> You can't trust him, Goliath.<eos> Why not just walk away from this whole mess right now?<eos> Leave him to go hang himself.<eos> Dagon knows where I can find Gareth.<eos> He'll give me the information when the israelites are defeated.<eos> Do you think your wife would want you to hurt innocent people...<eos> -...to avenge her?<eos> -No, she wouldn't!
I don't believe in secrets.<eos> I like people to be straight up and honest.<eos> But I'm not fool.<eos> D'you think I want these flats infamous for child murder? No.<eos> So I won't be telling your dad.<eos> He'd kill me.<eos> -Yeah, I just said that.<eos> -No, he would!<eos> Yeah, I think we've established that already actually, Ste!<eos> -They all would! All of them!
His car stopped, maybe, up on Poor Farm Road.<eos> Prosecutor says they have proof that Jacob destroyed evidence.<eos> Well, she has to say that, doesn't she?<eos> Still haven't found the murder weapon.<eos> But surely that helps our case.<eos> You're saying they've got a lousy case.<eos> Circumstantial, yes.<eos> I'm saying that's possible.<eos> Then I don't understand, Wendell, why are you dropping out on us?<eos> I wouldn't, uh...
We had one fight.<eos> It was ridiculous.<eos> She was furious because I didn't have a hair-dryer.<eos> It's normal. What the hell would I do with one?<eos> We had a huge fight.<eos> She wanted me to buy her a hair-dryer.<eos> She wouldn't bring hers - she had one at a friend's place.<eos> She wouldn't buy one either.<eos> No, I had to buy one for my place.<eos> I wouldn't.
Too right.<eos> Look, I don't mind him being raised a mick...<eos> I beg your pardon, Your Worship. But it's gone too far.<eos> Dane is a good boy.<eos> But they've got their claws in him. The Church, I mean.<eos> They even own Drogheda, his home.<eos> He goes on about being a priest all the time.<eos> He needs his dad.<eos> And you don't want him to be a priest?<eos> What father would?
billy: What's with the kids?<eos> New recruits?<eos> marian: It's the only safe place for them.<eos> None of them have homes.<eos> jimmy: They're not the only ones.<eos> I saw the theater.<eos> Actually, it's where we caught Abobo.<eos> billy:<eos> Abobo? jimmy: I don't remember Abobo being there.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Please?<eos> Cory, what are you doing?<eos> Well, I'm trying to see what this woman knows.<eos> Which I'm thinking is an awful lot.<eos> Do you really think this is a productive use of our time?<eos> Oh, absolutely.<eos> Hey, I found him first.<eos> Don't make me laugh.<eos> - Would you like to step outside?<eos> - Yeah, I would.
All right, that's it!<eos> Come on, we're going back.<eos> It's past your bedtimes.<eos> - Please, can we go to one more floor?<eos> - Yeah, one more floor!<eos> - Be a sport, Peter.<eos> - Yeah, be a sport, Peter.<eos> - Nurse "Ba-jerk" would let us.<eos> - Bjerke.<eos> And, yes, I would.
- Coffee? - That'd be great.<eos> Fine.<eos> The room is down the hall and to the right. I'll meet you there.<eos> Oh, Dad, this is a small thing but you left the sponge in the sink again.<eos> So?<eos> If it stays wet, it begins to smell and becomes a breeding ground for bacteria.<eos> So?<eos> So if I were to say, wipe up that salsa that you spilled on the table just now, I would be leaving behind bacteria such as salmonella and listeria.<eos> - Wouldn't that bother you?<eos> - Yeah, it would.
Oh, come on, MacLeod.<eos> It's not the whole Federal Reserve.<eos> Oh, well, that's a relief.<eos> It's more like a, you know, a Federal Reserve truck.<eos> A small one.<eos> And, look, Cory has promised... that no one, no one, no one is gonna get hurt.<eos> Oh, he guaranteed you that, did he?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> He has a plan.<eos> Oh, he would.
Yes, I am.<eos> Can you tell me where you've been the last few hours?<eos> Why?<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> We have a man who swears you attacked him with a sword.<eos> What would I be doing with a sword?<eos> Would you mind coming with me?<eos> No.<eos> Please.<eos> I wouldn't.
Yes, but is it edible?<eos> I can't say for sure.<eos> It could interact harmfully with stomach enzymes and microbes.<eos> - Certainly wouldn't want it to burn a hole in anyone's stomach.<eos> - Don't touch that, Ulysses.<eos> Please.<eos> It looks better than that gross spirulina.<eos> Not untilJulia says it's okay.<eos> Well, I guess there's only one way to see for sure.<eos> I wouldn't.
Well, I like to think it's a little more than that, Annie.<eos> It's not.<eos> Listen, Annie.<eos> I'm heading up the investigation.<eos> I'm surprised they're letting you.<eos> I mean, you and Lucas being such good friends and all.<eos> I don't think they know.<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, you know, Lucas wouldn't want you to get yourself in any trouble on his account.<eos> Yes, he would.
Interference from the nebula would make it impossible for the Chigs to track the fleet.<eos> They're entering the Cerus system through the back door.<eos> Then there's no need to go back to the prison. The marines will get their men.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I risked my life for you.<eos> They risked their lives for you.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> You don't understand.<eos> She would.
Of course, they had more boys.<eos> Shawn, you never told me this.<eos> Do you all want a little sample?<eos> - Come on, Pop.<eos> - Do it. Give them a taste.<eos> - No, we're not doing it, Pop.<eos> - Shawn, please, for me?<eos> Absolutely, positively not.<eos> Marlon, I would love to see you do that.<eos> You would?
BILLY: What's with the kids?<eos> New recruits?<eos> MARIAN: It's the only safe place for them.<eos> None of them have homes.<eos> JIMMY: They're not the only ones.<eos> I saw the theater.<eos> Actually, it's where we caught Abobo.<eos> BILLY:<eos> Abobo? JIMMY: I don't remember Abobo being there.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
These things we ask in Christ's name.<eos> - amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Well. this looks wonderful.<eos> Oh. meat loaf. great.<eos> So. what direction do you see your college studies taking you. Ricky?<eos> Actually. I haven't given it much thought.<eos> Well. there's no reason you have to decide now. you have plenty of time.<eos> He'd like to take over the farm someday.<eos> - l would?
Just lay off, OK?<eos> Stop tapping the fucking cup!<eos> Just don't hit me, OK?<eos> Don't hit me.<eos> Who's wound you up? Eh?<eos> Got to you, have they?<eos> Wound up like a little rubber band, are you?<eos> Just don't hit me, that's all I'm asking you.<eos> What are you letting me hit you for?<eos> Any other man wouldn't.
Oh, my God.<eos> Her top is so low.<eos> And her skirt is so high.<eos> That is bad.<eos> It is.<eos> It's very, very bad.<eos> Are you, uh... what I think you are?<eos> Well, I'm not the public health nurse.<eos> Would you... like some company?<eos> Yes, I would.
Either way, I can't do a thing.<eos> This planet is about to blow up.<eos> What can I do?<eos> Arrest it?<eos> I never should've let her go.<eos> I shouldn't have waited to call.<eos> Then why did you?<eos> I was afraid.<eos> Afraid she'd hang up on me.<eos> Afraid she wouldn't.
Very well. It's buried at 4723 Maple Valley Road.<eos> You take Highway 201 south for 15 minutes.<eos> You take a left, a left...<eos> Whoa! That was fun, ladies!<eos> What's the matter with you, kid?<eos> You told me the stream was shallow!<eos> Oh, you. Oh, kid. I'll get even with you.<eos> Hordes of panicky people seem to be evacuating the town... for some unknown reason.<eos> Professor, without knowing precisely what the danger is... would you say it's time for our viewers to crack each other's heads open... and feast on the goo inside?<eos> Yes, I would, Kent.
There's no soul.<eos> There's just rot and there's just decay.<eos> And I will never, ever, ever, ever have to face that.<eos> It's a stiff price though.<eos> Look at yourself-- drinking blood, living in darkness, unable to see your reflection in a mirror-- or is that just a myth?<eos> I can't be seen in a mirror.<eos> Look... anything worth anything has a price, and when I'm standing next to your deathbed looking as young as I look right now and I see that fear in your eyes at the moment of death... then, then tell me the price is too stiff.<eos> It's more likely I'll be looking into your eyes at the moment before they lead you into the gas chamber.<eos> But that's a moment you won't have to face if you tell me where the others are.<eos> Why would I?
We'd both go back,Jim, bein' the right thing and all.<eos> Yeah. Sure, bein' the right thing and all.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> I'll make sure Miss Watson takes you back.<eos> Smell that, Huck ?<eos> Smells like freedom.<eos> If that's Cairo, I'm a free man !<eos> And when I'm free, I'm gonna work hard... and save every penny and buy my wife and my children.<eos> And if they won't sell 'em, I'll steal 'em !<eos> You wouldn't.
- He had lied.<eos> He didn't have any such picture.<eos> Ravi has confessed in his suicide note that he was Seema's lover, and his killer too.<eos> And when you came here with him, he got scared of being caught.<eos> And thus he committed suicide.<eos> Your suspicion proved right.<eos> Seema's lover was, in fact, her killer.<eos> Forgive me, Seema.<eos> Along with your life, today I've even wiped out every evidence... connected with your death<eos> Because I'd no other alternative.
No crime in that, is there?<eos> - Be quiet.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Stand still!<eos> - You stand still, Tom!<eos> - I want my mum!<eos> - I want mum!<eos> - Let's just get you cleaned up first.<eos> You wouldn't want her to see you all messed up like this, would you?<eos> Yes I would!
It's all I have.<eos> Well, now, I wouldn't like to take all your money.<eos> No problem.<eos> Catch you again, Charlie.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> It's not even 8:00 yet.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> We must've just said good night to Charlie Burke when the bomb went off.<eos> I mean, all we were concerned about was where we were gonna sleep that night.<eos> We'd no money in our pockets.
I'm sure if you insist.<eos> - l won't ask Bruno.<eos> I'll spare you my life story.<eos> Can you?<eos> - Can you take her?<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> Have you seen my place?<eos> One room, no elevator.<eos> I'm never there. She'd never want to.<eos> Yes, she would.
Three months in which to get a job, keep it and create a suitable home.<eos> If this proves to be a possibility for you, I will consider a joint-custody arrangement when we reconvene.<eos> We're adjourned.<eos> Well, it looks like there is a little light at the end of our tunnel.<eos> - That's all my stuff.<eos> - This is all my fault.<eos> God, no. Why would you think that?<eos> I should have never had a birthday, Dad.<eos> - This never would have happened.<eos> - Yes, it would.
He'll be nice-looking when he's older, won't he?<eos> Are you going to break it off with him anyway?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was giving the matter my serious consideration. Then when I saw him sulking, Jesus!<eos> He was very good-looking, though. Very handsome.<eos> Not really, Mary.<eos> Not when you got up close to him.<eos> Beauty's only skin deep.<eos> It wasn't even that deep, Mary.<eos> He'd loads of little spots on his chin.
What do you do?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> - Where are you from?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What's your favorite color?<eos> - I don't know. Black?<eos> - Well, who's your favorite movie star?<eos> - Burt Reynolds.<eos> Do you want a bite of my pie?<eos> Yes, I would.
What-? What is that on your lip?<eos> - What?<eos> - It's like a discoloration.<eos> It's white.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it's white.<eos> - Why is that white?<eos> - You'd better get that checked out.<eos> - "Better get that checked out"?<eos> - I would.
Diane, what do you want?<eos> I don't want to lose him.<eos> I love him.<eos> Sorry.<eos> This plan was clearly not going to work.<eos> Gary's influence over Diane was too powerful.<eos> She'd do anything to make him happy.<eos> It was like she'd joined some kind of cult.<eos> I went from feeling I'd be in love with Diane forever to wondering if I'd ever fall in love with anyone again.<eos> I would.
I'm going to the senior dance.<eos> The second word sounds like "dance".<eos> - I'm going to the dance.<eos> - For what?<eos> In order to dance, drink punch, be with my friends, comprende?<eos> No. The world is under attack by legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?<eos> It's a senior dance.<eos> It's important.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
We all like you here, you know that.<eos> But you're a nigger and a lawyer is no realistic goal for a nigger.<eos> But why, Mr. Ostrowski?<eos> I gets the best grades in class.<eos> I got voted class president.<eos> I want to be a lawyer.<eos> I want you to think about something that you can be.<eos> You're good with your hands, making things.<eos> People would give you work.<eos> I would.
- Is she okay?<eos> - Chantelle?<eos> Sure. She's fine.<eos> Happy?<eos> Well, happy?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, she seems okay.<eos> She lives upstairs.<eos> I don't know if she's happy.<eos> No reason you would.
A birth certificate or a passport's just as good.<eos> - l don't have either of those.<eos> - Then we got a problem.<eos> Listen, she's just as American as I am.<eos> I'm sure she is.<eos> But since the latest ins crackdown, we've got some pretty strict regulations down here.<eos> Well, can't you just punch me into a computer?<eos> I'll give you my social security number, anything. I've got to get home.<eos> I'd love to help you, young lady.<eos> Really, I would.
- Women buy these products, Dan.<eos> - I think I'm aware of that.<eos> No, that's a man's concept of what appeals to a woman.<eos> Well, all the women I showed it to thought it looked terrific.<eos> What women?<eos> Your secretary?<eos> The ladies in accounting?<eos> What are they gonna say to Mr. California-suntan-vice-president?<eos> - Arnold thought it looked great.<eos> - Oh, Arnold would.
- Shut up !<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - I suppose if you're wearing dentures...<eos> Fancy a gander at the Eiffel Tower ?<eos> This is frightfully good...<eos> No, it's not !<eos> Eddie, no !<eos> No, don't do that, because I think it's time to go to the toilet.<eos> Wouldn't you like to come to the toilet with me ?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Annie,I don't have to.<eos> I just...<eos> That's way better than cookies.<eos> I'm sorry. Really.<eos> You know,if you weren't so freakin' adorable,<eos> I wouldn't even be having this conversation right now.<eos> - Can we start over?<eos> - Okay Yeah.<eos> So you want to go out this weekend?<eos> Yes,I would.
Listen, you get some sleep.<eos> I'm coming home tomorrow night and we'll talk about it.<eos> Don't you ever come back.<eos> I hate you.<eos> I hate you.<eos> But you don't understand.<eos> You see, I'd pleaded with her.<eos> I'd begged her, I'd argued with her.<eos> I'd done everything.<eos> But she just wouldn't.
But why?<eos> - He's a mass murderer!<eos> - Dad, cut it out!<eos> He's a loaded pistol!<eos> No tellin' when he'll go off!<eos> If he's so horrible and dangerous, why'd you hire him?<eos> Well, I ah...<eos> I'm a... I'm letting him go tomorrow.<eos> You wouldn't dare.<eos> Oh yes I would.
Reassuring, all in all.<eos> Very reassuring.<eos> That definitely gives us something to work on.<eos> What do you know about this place?<eos> Are my wife and baby safe there?<eos> After hearing from Senator Lacuture, I did some checking.<eos> The red cross has no record of any releases.<eos> But the Jastrow case is unique.<eos> I'd prefer to remain optimistic.<eos> Oh, you would, would you?
Oh, right, yes, right. Um, yes.<eos> I'd like to call my first witness, Captain Darling.<eos> You wish to call the counsel for the prosecution as a defence witness?<eos> That's right.<eos> Don't worry, sir, I've got it all under control.<eos> Ahem.<eos> You are Captain Darling of the general staff?<eos> I am.<eos> Captain, leaving aside the incident in question, would you think of Captain Blackadder as the sort of man who would usually ignore orders?<eos> Yes, I would.
Howlin' Chick Howell... on, um,<eos> This is...<eos> (music) [Rock And Roll] Couldn't think of anything snappy to say. Sometimes happens.<eos> Man, you've really got it bad.<eos> Now, now, Fred. I appreciate your opinion, but no matter how many editorials you publish, I am not gonna stop playing rock and roll.<eos> I'm not asking you to change everything you do, Rachel. Just don't play those records.<eos> You talk about rock and roll like it's some kind of contagious disease, like... like...<eos> Chicken pox?<eos> No, I think it's just inappropriate.<eos> And so would your father.
I can't take a chance on Byron finding out about us.<eos> Janice, you're a grown woman.<eos> There's nothing wrong with what we're doing here.<eos> I know that.<eos> But you know Byron, and I don't want him to get all upset and disapproving.<eos> Am I understanding you?<eos> Are you calling it off?<eos> Oh?<eos> Would you mind all that much?<eos> Hell, yes, I would.
Soldiers or not, we're going to the tomb.<eos> I'd love to show those soldiers what I think of them!<eos> Just eat, Simon.<eos> The true disciples of Jesus aren't killers.<eos> I know.<eos> But what are we?<eos> A bunch of frightened men.<eos> Why can't you still tell people about Jesus, Father?<eos> Who would believe in Him now that He's dead?<eos> I would.
These are typical brain scans from our subjects.<eos> It's very focused.<eos> It targets only certain areas of the brain.<eos> Air and vital functions:<eos> Breathing, heart rate.<eos> Looks like somebody turned it off with a switch.<eos> But in the areas controlling sensory awareness, thoughts and emotions... bang.<eos> So the animals know what's happening to them?<eos> Yeah, the entire time.<eos> A man would, too.
They'll have kids when they have kids.<eos> Maybe they're not ready.<eos> Are they going to be swingers the rest of their lives?<eos> Did your parents goad you into having kids?<eos> There was no time to goad me.<eos> No, I had my kids right away.<eos> Down at my company, everybody my age or around my age has a picture on their desk of a grandchild.<eos> I have a picture on my desk of her.<eos> What I want to have on my desk is a picture of a grandchild.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Cut yourself then!<eos> Haven't you finish talking?<eos> We're in the beginning still!<eos> Still in the beginning for so many hours!<eos> Don't you want to die?<eos> Don't move!<eos> Everybody don't move!<eos> Would you pay the debt?<eos> Yes, yes!<eos> Why wouldn't I?
We have been on a country picnic, sir.<eos> Hosted by your mother.<eos> My mother?<eos> She authorized taking out all those carriages and inviting all those girls?<eos> No, sir.<eos> And as she has nothing better to think about than herself, I thought that it was high time someone tried to help her.<eos> Then you really are as insane as all the rumors I've heard about you.<eos> What have you heard?<eos> -You wouldn't want to know.<eos> Yes, I would.
